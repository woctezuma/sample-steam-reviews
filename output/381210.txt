Out of all the reviews I wrote, This one is probably the most serious one I wrote. 

For starters the community of this game sucks just like every online game, You don't wanna talk to them because they're all just jerks who wanna say you suck or you camped or blah blah blah, its rare to get a nice compliment out of people in this game.

But you don't have to talk to the community either. Unlike most online games this one doesn't have a mic system so you don't have to worry about hearing a twelve year old cry baby raging at you for nothing. Only time you can talk to people in the game is in the beginning before the match starts if your a survivor and at the end after the match is over as both killer and survivor, The end chat is the only one the killer can talk to everyone in the match though. Mostly just to say GG for Good Game.

As Survivor you can basically just play every man for himself and be sneaky and say screw you to the other players or you can try to be a good team mate and rescue them if they get on a hook but if someone is a jerk in the chat before the match then you know who not to save if they get hooked. 

I mostly play killer because I find it more fun than playing survivor and someones gotta play killer and from what I hear most people enjoy playing survivor more. Probably becuase as survivor it feels like a horror game and you get team mates while as killer you're by yourself.

But what i'm really trying to say is this game is really great even though the community sucks, Just ignore the community and if you get someone who is raging at the end just say gg to them and leave. After seeing that they didn't make you argue with them and waste your time it might make them even more mad even if you got the last word aka GG. So I give this game a 8/10. 

I wonder if anyone actually read this review, I actually had to take my time to write this because I didn't wanna swear in it so you didn't see nothing but censor hearts that steam likes to do. So if you actually read this let me know by leaving a comment so I can be like someone read this peice of crap review yay!
Disclaimer: I survivor main. 

I play games for fun, not for competition, so the DBD community doesn't really get to me. If I get a bad killer that face camps, oh well. I die and move on to the next game. If I get a good killer who finds me immediately, hooks me (bc I can't juke whoops), and then patrol camps (which I'm 100% OK with), then no biggie. Next game please~

I think a lot of the community salt from killers comes from dealing with rank one survivors that don't actually play the game properly and just run around and flash the killer in the face. And while that is a legitimate strategy, it takes away from the fun of the game in my opinion.

As a killer (a horrible one), I've also been called names by survivors who tell me to 'get gud.' Older players ruin it for newer players or players who don't put in 1000s of hours. Just relax and have fun with the game! So what if you don't pip up - there is always the next game :)

That being said, this game is crazy fun. Don't let the saltiness of the community keep you from buying the game. Grab it, have fun with it, and ignore anyone who might give you a hard time ;) And don't fixate too much on the ranking process unless you're absurdly highly competitive for some reason (also fine - just try not to let it push you into spouts of anger!), and even then, recognize that there are jerks who play this game, like any other game, and have fun while you compete!
Absolutely love the game, but ofcourse there are flaws. Not gonna say its the community or "OP" killers, but a major glitch in the system.
The whole reason i decided to write this review is to warn new players of a game ruining glitch, and how to fix it.
Today my data, 58 hours of gameplay, was completely reset. While playing, i got a connection error, then a message saying "The season has ended". When i went to check out my characters, THEY WERE ALL LEVEL ONE.
now, to save yourself from this utterly horrible and game ruining experience (which i know will lead to you leaving a pretty bad review of the game), here's a fix!

STEP 1: Go to the location of your steam data, then your Dead by Daylight save. (Which in my case is OS (C:)\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata\129389900\381210\remote\ProfileSaves)
STEP 2: Copy the file located within ProfileSaves to a safe location. (I leave it directly on my desktop)
OPTIONAL STEP 3: Make a Shortcut to your ProfileSaves folder and place on desktop for easy access.
STEP 4: Update your save (copy save and replace) everytime you close the game. If you dont do this, you could lose hours of progress like i did today. (I lost about 4 hours of progress)

Good luck to you noobies, and have fun. Because this game is amazing!

Dead by Daylight is an amazing assymetrical survival horror game. I will provide a pro/con list, and then rebuttle the most common negative claims against the game. 

[h1] Pros [/h1]
* Developers are active within the community
* Lots of progression and levelling to give you a reason to keep coming back
* Survivor perks from DLC are accessible to those without DLC, only requiring extra effort.
* Game is, despite what some players may say, balanced.
* Allows teamplay with minimal communication
* Lots of tension, and some required decision making
* Long lifetime, game produced 1 year ago, and still supports an average of 8,000-10,000 players per day

[h1] Cons [/h1]
* Decent amount of the community is toxic, but welcome to the internet
* Peer to Peer connection (If the killer's internet is bad, your ping/connection will be bad)
* There are a fair amount of bugs/glitches in the game, but none are entirely game breaking. 



[h1] Rebuttles [/h1]
One popular claim is that the game is horrible due to it's toxic community. My main contention here is that the game does not permit voice chat, and instead provides you with two emote options. One to point, and one to wave. Some survivors will tbag on the other side of objects just to aggravate/annoy the killer, but that isn't really a viable issue to hate the game for. Overall the coommunity is no reason to hate the game, and it isn't even that severe. 

A second, extremely popular complaint, is that camping a surviver that is on the hook as the killer is overpowered and should be removed somehow (which would be incredibly complicated to do from a development standpoint). The issue with this complaint is that the only time when camping is affective is when all of the survivors commit their time playing to attempting to save the survivor on the hook. If instead, the survivors chose to work on generators, statistically they could each get over 1 generator done before the player on the hook died. This would allow the players to complete enough generators to escape with only 1, or if unlucky 2... survivors being sacrificed. The issue is not with the game, it is yet again an issue with the failure of players to adapt.

Another claim is that the new killer, The Huntress, is absolutely unbalanced. The reason for a lot of complaint is that The Huntress is the first ranged killer in the game. Is she overpowered though? Not at all. I have played against an incredibly large amount of killers choosing to play The Huntress, especially seeing as it was released just one day before I made this review, and have won the vast majority of the matches. The Huntress was placed into the game to allow for both far more variation in gameplay, and to shake up the "meta", forcing players to adapt. The issue with that is, however, a lot of players do not wish to spend time adapting, and instead resort to despising the developers. I appreciate their attempts to add far more variation and effort into the game. One key detail that people who complain about the new killer fail to mention very often, is that the new killer can be heard from much further away, allowing for the survivor to react quicker, and hide appropriately. Although some may say that the sound of the killer's humming is quiet, in a game such as Dead by Daylight, sound is everything. You should be prepared to commit your attention entirely to the game during a match. If you do not, then your failures are not a result of the development team.

Many players also complain about the lack of voice communication, because they do not feel as if your current implemented communication methods, pointing and waving, are effective enough. However, as seen with Friday the 13th: The Game, you will absolutely ruin any hopes of immersion and tarnish the horror aesthetic when you enable voice chat, which results in players blasting loud shrek theme songs through their microphones, or yelling the entire game so that you, again, can not pay as much attention too the actual game. A reply to my claim might say that you could simply permit blocking players so that you may not hear them. However, if as you said, the community is toxic, how many players do you honestly think you will not have to block? Even if you don't have too block people in a game, the killer would suffer tremendously from that communication. It is for this reason that a majority of people playing killer in the game recognize that survive with friends (swf) is even nearing overpowered. This is because the implementation of a survivor queueing system allows for survivors to communicate more, and better counter the killer during a game. If there is a great deal of hate towards a smaller system such as swf which even slightly allows voice communication, the development team should surely know better than to implement a full voice communications system for players. And they do, so I commend them for their resilience with putting up with the community's failure to fully think out their complaints. 

[i]I may update this review if I either recall more additions I wished to add, or other issues are brought to my attention.[/i]

[b] TL;DR: People who complain about this game's issues, and quit the game due to them, do not fully understand the implications of either changing the matter, or just what they are talking about. This gameis great and worth a buy, and a popular complaint about the toxic community can explain away a great deal of people's poor reviews. [/b]

Overall, has a very repetitive sense of two different playstyles. Where killing requires significantly more concentration, survivor is somewhat more chill as an experienced player, but is often an M1 simulator if you dont involve yourself with the game much. This repetivity is very clear, but the different survivors you play against all have different playstyles, and the killers have completely different "powers" which can tilt the game at any point. If you want a more relaxing experience to sit down and play something, then it would be better to play survivor. Killer requires endless concentration and intense focus so you need to be in a proper gaming mood.
I would highly recommend this game to someone who needs a time-waster video game and wants to funnel some hours into it in their spare time. It's a good horror for the first 50 hours but loses that factor after you stop taking the game seriously in terms of getting scared. There is a grinding system involved which will take anyone a long time to get anything especially the bare bone amount you earn ingame, but achieving the grind and getting the perks (massive game  factor) that you want that will greatly change the way you play. 
It's just amazing and the game I turn on everyday for a good 6+ hours.
- Ran around the woods with a chainsaw
- Found a person and sawed them down
- Sacrificed them on a meat hook
- Found and killed the rest of the people in the area
- Came home and played Dead by Daylight

10/10 would play the game again
Everything in this game is incredible just a one thing {Friends Party} i dont like how you have to send invite to your friend EVERYGAME

Thx Guys for make it helpful.
This is simultaneously the most fun, and most infuriating game I've played in a long time.

It's an asymmetrical game where one player is a powerful killer, hunting down 4 elusive survivors before they can start generators and leave the trial.

For an asymmetrical game, it's in a state where it's surprisingly balanced between the two sides. Either side has a few things that infuriate the other (Decisive Strike and No One Escapes Death are the current front runners) and certain killers are notoriously overpowered, or underpowered. Freddy Kreuger mains, for instance, must hate themselves to play that, and Nurse mains must just hate playing the game fairly.

New content is regular, 1 killer, 1 survivor, 3 perks for each side, and a map are released every 3 months or so, mid chapter balance patches occur, and cosmetics are regularly added.

There are downsides however. While balance patches come regularly, they won't do anything incremental. Freddy is ridiculously weak, but they refuse to give him small quality of life changes that they have said he needs until they are ready to release a full rework of him. Meaning rather than sitting at a 'meh' stage, he sits in boring, weak and generally unfun.

Pay to pay to keep paying. Buying the game will net you around half the cast. Many are also available through grinding, however licensed killers and survivors require further payment. Their perks are also locked to you, unless they are picked on the "random" weekly shrine. (The good ones rarely are.) On top of this, despite in game currency being used for cosmetics, anything they think looks good or will be popular is locked behind payment only. It's a dick move when you may have already spent upwards of $80 just to unlock characters.

Awesome, and incredibly angry, community, as you'd expect from a game like this.
When Michael Myers gives you more attention and love than your own boyfriend and he had so many wonderful traits like ...

> He will pursue you no matter how hard it gets
> He won't let you go even if you want to
> He will give you some time to open up
> Stares at you w/ those passionate eyes
> He had those kinky stuffs like putting you in his underground basement
> He will accept your friends ( well seriously he will hunt them down )

Over all, He's just the perfect guy for you
10/10 would play again
Is it perfect? No. Is it fun? Bloody hell yes. 

This game isn't going to be for everyone. Odds are you ARE going to be helpless as a suvivor. That's the point. Survivors are suppose to be helpless against a Killer. As a suvivor you don't play to win games, you play to survive them. And as a Killer you play to do one thing and only one thing, kill. If you don't like being helpless against an unstopable Killer IF he finds you, then odds are you aren't going to like Dead by Daylight. But if you are smart. Then either the Survivors or Killer can turn the odds in their favor to make fools out of the other.

Pros-
-Playing as a slasher flick killer. 3 of them with more in the works.
-Being a victim of a slasher flick. Escape death with skill, maybe just dumb luck, or die in soiled pants.
-4v1 gameplay that goes extra lengths to make each side stand apart from the other.
-Great use of sounds for information.
-RNG tile based maps. 1-2 landmarks per map will aways be in the same places, but everything else will change every game.
-Games last 10 minutes on average.

Cons-
-Some model bugs like rarely seeing your own hair/eyes as a Killer or some janky movement with Killers interacting with suvivors.
-Balance. One Killer is weaker than the other 2. Windows close together can make near 100% safe zones for survivors depending on a few things. Some perks are rather annoying, maybe a touch OP.
-Games have no timers. If someone wants to waste your time, they can if they are good enough.
-No communication. It is impossible to talk to each other without 3rd party chats like Steam, Teamspeak, Skype, ect.
-Making a lobby as a Killer can take up to 10 minutes to fill. Not from player counts mind you. Either another bug or a waiting list with strict "first come, first filled" rules.

In short-

For $20 you are going to get one hell of a fun game! Just note that it might not be for everyone as not everyone can handle playing as victims who are by design made to be helpless more often than not.
Very fun game, even better with friends!! Can be a bit annoying sometimes but that's to be expected with any online game. Haha still can't juke for the life of me though
If you enjoy hanging on a meathook while a homicidal maniac stares lovingly into your eyes as he pleasures himself and your teammates rush in to get points despite the fact that they're going to die because they were fed paint chips as a child then this is the game for you!

[b]After playing for more than two years, I am given the task of reviewing this game again.

This review will be as complete as possible, so if you do not want to see the full review, I recommend you go to the final part of the review to see the opinion and final rating. This review will consist of 5 sections and some sub-sections.[/b]

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
This game consists of there being 4 survivor and one killer who must complete a series of objectives on a map. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening doors. For its part, the killers must pursue, hang, sacrifice or kill the survivors.
Survivors and killers have the possibility to use perks, objects, accessories and offerings that help to give advantage within a game.
Offers good mechanics for escaping the killer or catching the survivor as:

[list]
    [*]Pallets
    [*]Windows
    [*]360's
    [*]Moonwalks
    [*]Hide
    [*]Different powers in each killer
[/list]
The balancing is one of the most difficult aspects of the game. Each update changes the balance, making nerf or buff to the killer and survivors. In my opinion, there are many things where the balancing is good. but there are many other things that fail a lot.
Rating:
[list]
    [*]Balance  6/10
    [*]Mechanical system 9/10
    [*]Innovation 8/10
    [*]Gameplay 8/10
[/list]
[h1]Graphics [/h1]
It uses the graphic engine Unreal Engine 4, which is an engine with quite good lighting and easy to use with respect to other engines. In the graphic section, optimization and animation Dead by Daylight is mediocre because there are enough graphic bugs or animation, but it must be understood that Behaviour is not Epic game to be able to invest so much money in that aspect.
[list]
    [*]Animation 6/10
    [*]Optimization 5/10
    [*]Graphics 6/10 
[/list]
[h1] Matchmaking[/h1] 
In this aspect, the game has improved a lot these 2 years, but it's still quite mediocre, there are quite a few bugs in looking for killers and supervients. The worst thing is that the host is the killer and there are no servers. And besides the rank system fails a lot, there are games that can touch you ranks 20 being rank 1.
[list]
    [*]Servers 0/10
    [*]Matchmaking 5/10
    
[/list]
[h1] Conclusion[/h1] 

This game has great potential for anyone who likes the "Slasher" or wants to spend good nights with friends or killing survivors. That potential is covered up by big bugs.

[b]Después de estar jugando por mas de dos años, me doy a la tarea de volver a hacer un reseña de este juego.

Esta reseña sera lo mas completo posible, así que si no quieres ver toda la reseña, te recomiendo ir a la parte final de la reseña para ver la opinión y valoración final. Esta reseña estará compuesta por 4 apartados y algunos sub-apartados.

[h1] Gameplay[/h1] 
Este juego consiste en que hay 4 superviviente y un asesino que deben completar una serie de objetivos en un mapa. Los supervivientes debe escapar del asesino reparando 5 generadores y abriendo unas puertas. Por su parte, los asesinos debe perseguir, colgar, sacrificar o matar a los supervivientes.
Los supervivientes y asesinos tienen la posibilidad de usar habilidades, objetos, accesorios y ofrendas que ayudan a dar ventaja dentro de una partida.
Ofrece un buen mecánicas para escapar del asesino o atrapar al superviviente como:

[list]
    [*]Pallets
    [*]Ventanas
    [*]360's
    [*]Moonwalks
    [*]Esconderse
    [*]Poderes diferentes en cada killer
[/list]
El balanceo es uno de los aspectos mas difíciles del juegos. En cada actualizacion se cambia el balanceo, haciendo nerf o buff a los killer y supervivientes. En mi opinion, hay muchas cosas donde el balanceo esta bien. pero hay muchas otras cosas que fallan mucho.

[h1] Gráficos [/h1] 
Usa el motor gráfico Unreal Engine 4, lo que es un motor con bastante buena iluminación y fácil de usar con respecto a otros motores. En el apartado gráfico, optimización y animación  de Dead by Daylight es mediocre por que hay bastantes bugs gráficos o animación, pero se debe entender que que Behaviour no es Epic game para poder invertir tanto dinero en ese aspecto.
[list]
    [*]Animación 6/10
    [*]Optimización 5/10
    [*]Gráficos 6/10 
[/list]
[h1] Matchmaking[/h1] 
En este aspecto, el juego ha mejorado bastante estos 2 años, pero sigue siendo bastante mediocre, Hay bastantes bugs en buscar killers y supervientes. Lo peor es que el host sea el killer y no haya servers. Y aparte falla mucho el sistema de rank, hay partidas que te pueden tocar rangos 20 siendo rango 1.
[list]
    [*]Servidores 0/10
    [*]Matchmaking 5/10
    
[/list]
[h1] Conclusión[/h1] 

Este juego tiene un gran potencial para todo aquel que le guste el "Slasher" o que quiere pasar buenas noches con amigos o matando y haciendo enojar a supervivientes. Ese potencial se ve tapado por grandes bugs.

Best way I can describe this game?

When you were a child being chased by a bee,
This is the adult version of that situation.

Just that the bee is capable of picking up your whole body weight and squiring you onto a rusty meat hook, Actually it's a lot worse.

Recommended, made me anxious at every turn.
Very fun and challenge Co-op survival game with friends. Dead By Daylight will bring you many ways to survive, run, hide or die from the Killers. You'll find yourself with a group of more three survivors trying to complete only one goal: power up remaining generators to open the exit gates and win the round. 

However, a specific Killer will be hunting you down attempting to stop your goal and kill you by hooking you. Maps will randomly place these generators around the map, with few other supplies and plates to help your objective-- medkits to heal your teammates or yourself; tool box to speed up repair progress generators; flashlight to blind the Killer; a map to search for generators and other features; and a Key.

Plus with a huge point system by leveling up your character or Killer, and many other skills and add-ons for your items. Only few things spoils this awesome game: lagging Killers, "few-ish" existence bugs and 'camping Killers' focusing in your death than hunting other players.
9/10

10/10 would rat out campers again
After about 250 hours of playing Dead By daylight and having it since 2016, i can say it is one of my favourite games, some people may say it's repetitive, but that's just their choice of play style, there is always different ways to play this game with different perks or even different people, that's what i like so much about Dead By Daylight.

The community of this game can be quite "Toxic" but on the other hand it can be equally as nice, E.g being complimented for saving someones life. However you can get some rude people, just like in every other community that calls you a camper or telling you that you suck. Every community has these types of people. sadly enough we can't change that. Not to mention it is only the start of the game where you may speak to fellow survivors or you can wait to the end of the game where you may chat to the killer aswell, there is no voice chat.

While being a survivor your objective is to complete 5 generators and then open atleast one of the doors to escape. Usually atleast one survivor gets placed on a hook, which it is up to you or the rest of your team to save (unhook) the survivor. Depending on the player you are, you may just stick to gens, which may be bad as that may be the plan for your other team mates aswell, ending in that player on the hook dying. Being in a team of 4 and in a voice call will give you an advantage as you have communication on your side. As a survivor main, i personally like being chased and using the environment to my advantage to lose the killer, just to find him 2minutes later :).

Playing killer gives you a complete different POV as you're alone so you don't have to worry about anyone else, you can just get on with how you play without any interuptions. Your goal is to kill all 4 survivors before the gates are open using the powers the killer you picked has, to your advantage.

I personally really enjoy playing this game with my close friends, it feels complete when you're playing with others, even if you're playing solo, you still get to meet new people where they may be quite nice. Ignore the toxic players.
Overall i would give this game a 8.5/10
- Ran around the woods with a chainsaw
- Found a person and sawed them down
- Sacrificed them on a meat hook
- Found and killed the rest of the people in the area
- Came home and played Dead by Daylight

10/10 would play the game again
When you play survivor:
-Teammates will fail skillchecks while healing you or repairing then tactically run away so you will be found and killed instead.
-Teammates will die like a cattle trying to save hooked one from Leatherface with chainsaw ready or under Exposed (both 1 hit = dead) debuff.
-Teammates will completely ignore you being hooked and do objectives while you buying them time dying on hook.
-Teammates will repeatedly unhook you in front of the killer (farming points on you) so you will be downed and killed in seconds.
-Teammates will lead killer to you or show your location with their flashlights so once again they can do stuff while you die.
[b]>> In summary - Sociopath Simulator[/b]

When you play Killer:
-If you killed noone, but got plenty of points and ranked up in process - you will be called noob in game chat after the game.
-If you killed 3 or all 4 of them - you will be called noob because used "cheating" (effective) perks and tactics.
-If you killed all 4 of them without any perks (by forgetting to add them before game lol) - you will be called lucky noob.
-If you killed the one and only guy who teabagged and distracted you all game to give him a valuable lesson - you will be called noob anyway.
-If you killed the overconfident guy who played worse than behaved - he will probably also say something about your mom too.

This game taught me that no matter how good you play and what you do, in the end there will always be guys expressing anger, hate, toxicity and all possible options for gay and racism insults. You may think that the majority of its playerbase consists of inadequate kids and here comes the most scary part of this "horror" game - these are adults, living next door and surrounding you in your everyday life.
Dead by Daylight is one of my favourite games ever. I bought the game just over a year ago and have already racked up over 1,100 hours because it’s so damn addictive to play. The constant improvements and love that the devs give to this game and the community has made it last unlike certain other games *cough* Friday the 13th *cough*, not to mention the new content that comes out every couple of months, introducing badass new killers and survivors, and a beautiful new map. Yes the community is toxic as hell and triggers the s*** out of me from time to time, and it’s not the most balanced of games, but it doesn’t stop me from loading it up on a daily basis to have fun.
TL;DR:  Game is fun, but has moments when you are most decidedly not having fun. Ratio of fun vs not fun varies depending on experience, temperament of yourself and those around you, level of intoxication, and number of f*cks given.

Ok. So you're a beginner looking to pick up this game. As a survivor, I'll tell you right now, you're going to hate it at first. There's no tutorial, and it's kind of like a rogue lite in the sense that it's nearly impossible to accomplish anything when you first start out. But, even though you die over and over again, you still earn bloodpoints that you can spend on items and perks to make yourself just a little bit stronger. Pretty soon you'll start actually escaping, or at least earn enough points to not de-rank. You can watch all the youtube videos you want, but to get better at DbD, you're just going to have to play.

I have no idea what to expect at the higher tiers of gameplay, or if I'll even get there at this point, but so far I'm firmly in a love-hate relationship with this game.
I want to start by advising you to take the recent negative review burst with a pinch of salt. The game has been rebalanced a bit, and a vocal minority of the community feel less powerful. This has ruined the game for them.

I would say the changes are amazing and expand the viable options available, which makes for a more varied and interesting game.

This is a great asymmetrical pvp. I've had a lot of fun both surviving and hunting. It's been a really unique experience for me.
If you like being startled and fancy a solid horror challenge, this game is great. 

Don't get me wrong, it won't be for everyone. Sometimes you'll lose and there's nothing you can do about it. 
Sometimes as killer you'll be up against four survivors who wreck you and rub it in your face the whole game.
Sonetimes as survivor you'll be hooked in minutes with no chance to escape.

Along with the asymmetry, this can create vocal cliques of whiny survivor or killer mains. If you will be upset about not feeling powerful, this may not be your game. 

If you like the premise and can lose with a bit of maturity, I'd bet you'll love it.
Any longtime Dead by Daylight player knows that this isn't a horror game. If you're looking for scares, I wouldn't consider this to be a scary game because it becomes quite predictable over time. It doesn't have enough build-up of suspense to instill fear of actually getting caught by the killer. That said and set aside, I enjoy a good chase, or simply losing the killer's line of sight and giving them the slip. It can be quite funny when you outsmart someone by hiding around a tree or a rock. There have been times where I have lost killers simply by doing circles around an object and remaining hidden. Those moments are where the game succeeds in my eyes. Hide and seek has always been fun for me in games that can manage to get it right, and it's one of the aspects that drew me to Dead by Daylight. It's a game about being sneaky, and trying not to get caught. On the other hand however, getting seen on purpose and taking the killer for a long chase helps your team repair generators unhindered and also gains you plenty of boldness points for distracting and ultimately helping your team escape as a whole, because every second a killer spends wasted on chasing a pro runner is a second your 3 teammates need to utilize towards getting the 5 generators in the map up and running to power the exit door. Contentwise there is a continued introduction of new killers and survivors alongside them, each with their own unique abilities which keeps things interesting. As with any game I feel the need to mention that a community and the people encountered in online situations are what make and break a game, and sometimes it's possible that you get a killer that camps you after he has hung you up on the hook, which can be very not fun. 

I give Dead by Daylight an 8/10 and I've enjoyed my many hours playing, and so I will recommend.
[b] Long review incoming! [/b]

EDIT: I decided to edit my review after getting to know the game a bit more. The original review was after 70 hours of playing and this one is after 300 hours. The comments below reflect the original review. 

Dead by Daylight is a 4vs1 online multiplayer game. One player plays the killer and the other three or four players are the survivors. The survivors win by working together to repair the generators and then opening the door without being killed. The killer has to find the survivors and hook them all to please the Entity. 

    
[u] PROS [/u]

- [b] The Perks. [/b] Each survivor and each killer have unique perks. Perks are basically equippable abilities that help you in some way. Some examples are Claudette, who can heal herself and Meg, who can sprint away quickly.  Customizing your survivor or killer adds variety to your character and lets you create your own play style.  

- [b] Items. [/b] The item system adds more tension to the game. You have to level up to get items, but you lose the one you brought into the game if you die. Thus, resulting in a risk if you bring a really great item into the trial. If you are a killer, you already have your main item, and you can then attach addons. There is a nice variety of items that all have different levels of quality. 

  - [b] Atmosphere. [/b] The atmosphere in this game is superb. There are several different sounds that add heavy ambiance, but also serve as audio cues for both survivor and killer. I recommend quality headphones to really get immersed. 

 - [b] The horror. [/b] The sounds, the heartbeat, the rush to the generators while constantly watching your back. It's a survival horror game and it does a great job at making you feel like you are being stalked. Meanwhile if you are playing the killer, you have a feeling you keep seeing a survivor in the corner of your eye... 

 - [b] Teamwork. [/b]  Other then working together on the generators, your team can help you in other ways. Other survivors can unhook you, heal you, and use flashlights to try to save you from the killers grasp. If you with the right people, working together can be a lot of fun.

  - [b] Killers. [/b] I know I've mentioned this before, but there is a nice variety of killers that all feel and function differently. They each have a power that sets them apart, along with the unique perks. For example: The Wraith can turn invisible, The Hag can teleport to her traps, and the Trapper can lay out bear traps for survivors to get stuck in. They have different speeds, audio cues, etc.  It's a lot of fun to try them all. 

- [b] First person/third person perspective. [/b]  The killer can't be killed, but he does have a weakness. His vision. Survivors see in a third person perspective, meaning they can see all around them in a wider angle. Meanwhile the killer can only see in a first-person view which gives him tunnel like vision. This makes it easier for survivors to hide when they have nowhere to go. I think this was a really neat idea that really balances out that part of the game and let's you show off your stealth abilities. The killer is faster and deadlier, but the survivor can better scope out their surroundings.  


[u] CONS [/u]

 - [b] Not Newbie Friendly. [/b] Originally when I wrote this, there was no tutorial. They just added a tutorial which is really great. The game still leaves out a lot of very important things  that they only tell you on the tip screens. I honestly think games like this should have a log in the options menu where they store their tips. Also the community isn't always welcoming to newbies and they can make it very hard to learn when you have no idea what you are doing. 

 - [b] DLC/Microtransactions [/b] Most of the non liscensed killers used to be DLC along with a whole bunch of item packs. They finally added an in game store where you can buy the non liscensed killers for shards (currency earned by playing). Although a great improvement, they also added in some seriously expensive microtransactions. I'm talking, five dollars for a shirt expensive. Right now it's just ouftits but it feels like it could lead to worse things.

 - [b] Bugs. [/b] This game is not as buggy for me as the reviews say. I think they patched most of it. I do get some bugs here and there though. I think the servers are the worst part. I get kicked a lot and sometimes it doesn't let me join a game. It's not enough to ruin the experience but it does take patience on its bad days.  

  
- [b] Community. [/b] I think this IS the worst thing about Dead By Daylight. All PVP games have trolls but DbD has an especially toxic community. After most matches I'm surprised when I don't get insulted. Especially playing the killer, because people hate to lose and they make sure to blame it on any term they can such as "camping," "tunneling," even if it's not true. This usually happens when you go up in rank, so if you play casually you won't have as many issues. My friend suggested unranked lobbies and honestly that idea would fix a lot of issues with the game. I highly recommend playing with friends since you can guarantee more fun. I still play online with strangers and although it has it's share of trolls, It still doesn't ruin my love for the game. 

[u] VERDICT [/u] 
If you are interested in the trailer or description then you should grab the game. It's exactly what it advertised and it delivers on most positive aspects. There are issues with bugs and a toxic community, which is why I recommend you buy it on discount. If you plan on playing it with friends instead of online, it would probably be even more fun.
When you want a fast game like an "Hide n Seek", with a piece of Horror, and some quests to do while you have an urgent need of escape from a killer...just play this game :)

Game of Arenas, PVP with a taste of terror.
Lots of adrenaline, a sense of chase and no safe at all. Brutal game to spend good times alone or with friends.
The scenarios change in each round where you see macabre and not friendly environments.
Several Killers and several Survivors to choose from, PERKS, and offerings to change the game before you start the round.
I advise to play with GOOD Sound. Inappropriate for those who suffer from the heart :)

If you play survivor you'll have a difficult game, where skilled gameplay and second lasting decisions can be the difference between actually surviving, or getting yourself and possibly even a teammate killed. You can probably get through an entire game without even seeing the killer, escape, and then find out your other 3 teammates had a hell of a time juking the killer around pallets. Or you can be the survivor that jukes the killer around pallets, through windows, and accross the map, only to find the hatch or escape before he can down you.

If you play killer, you'll have a difficult game, where if you win, the survivors will call you names and make fun of you for one of the following reasons:
[list]
    [*]Camping (You stayed more than 5 seconds near a hooked survivor, sometimes less)
    [*]Tunneling (You tried to attack someone you've already hooked)
    [*]Running cheap perks (You used a perk that makes you stronger)
    [*]Facecamping (You actually stayed close to the hooked survivor for a prolonged period of time)
    [*]So bad (When the survivor can't figure out what excuse they can use to make you feel bad)
    [*]Hacker (They'll find a way to say you're hacking, regardless if you are or not)
    [*]Lag-Switch (You or they lagged at any point in the game, and it's your fault)
    [*]Rude (You didn't spare the last survivor)
    [*]Reported (You did any of the above to a Survive With Friends team that never read the rules)
    [*]Tryhard (You tried to win)
    [*]No-Life (If they check your profile and you have more than 100 hours)
    [*]Cheater (You used in-game mechanics to try to win. Ex: Body blocking to prevent Borrowed Time)
[/list]
If you don't win, and therefor, you don't kill ANY survivors, they'll usually end the game by saying "gg" or calling you bad. Also, they'll usually teabag you at the exit gates regardless of what happens during the game. Oh, and the gameplay is fun.
- Wait for a new killer DLC to come out!
- Play with him and have a fair chance against high ranked survivors!
- People start complaining and the killer gets nerfed!
- Get bullied!
- Repeat!
In Dead By Daylght, each game consists of 4 survivors and one killer. Survivors must escape from the killer by repairing 5 generators and opening the two doors. Killers must chase after the survivors and sacrifice them. Survivors and killers are able to use perks, objects in the environment, add-ons and offerings that help to give advantage within the game. Dead by Daylight is also quite similar to Deathgarden from the same developer. It features a hunter that is trying to incapacitate & kill runners.

With over 300 hours in the game so far, I can honestly say it's one of my favorites. Lets start off by saying that this game isn't going to be for everyone. If you're the type of person to get salty, then chances are this game will make you extremely mad at some point. Yes, any game can make someone rage, but in Dead By Daylight, the salt is real. Almost like League of Legends, maybe even more. 

If you're a killer, survivors will body block, pallet loop, pallet stun you, flashlight(Blind) you, hold you hostage(hiding and never leaving) and ragequit. If you're a survivor, killers will lag switch, face camp(not moving from you while you are hooked), slug, or focus you(most call it tunneling). Both sides have OP perks that the other side thinks is unfair, and if you main killer, you'll have to face groups of friends that are all communicating in discord which puts you at a big disadvantage. 

Also, I wouldnt say its neccessary, but it is very recomended to have headphones. Whether you are the killer or a survivor. You will want to hear those footstepds, crows, survivors breathing, heartbeats, etc. Sound will play an important role in how you play. 

Unfortunetly, if you are here for a true horror game, you might want to look somewhere else. The initial scariness wears off pretty fast. The jump scares are still there though. Especially with Myers and Amanda. 

Might not be heartstoppingly scary, but If you like being startled and fancy a solid challenge, this game is great. 

10/10, would pay full price for this game and buy all the DLCS again.
I love:

-getting pallet looped
-gen rush
-getting stunned
-getting blinded while picking up a survivor
-scratch marks disappearing for some reason even though i just saw where the survivor ran
-[i]entity displeased[/i]
-trying to get to rank 1 killer for 10 hours only to fail because i keep getting matched with god like survivors
-decisive strike

i also love:

-hitting huntress hatches from 100 million miles away
-killing all 4 survivors within seconds, then seeing them complain in chat afterwards
-judith's tombstone + fragrant tuft of hair myers
-jumpscare myers
-myers in general
-hillbilly moving faster than the speed of light
-when i get into a game with non-toxic survivors that say gg regardless of who won
-this game

10/10, favorite game right now
TLDR: Community is insanely toxic, game is buggy, unbalanced, but has a great concept.

This is one of those experiences where a "maybe" option would be best instead of the "yes or no" Steam allows.
Fact is, the idea behind the game is great, the devs are very transparent and the microtransactions are mostly fair; if you play it on a casual basis, you might have a very good time, expecially with friends.
On the other hand, the community is HUGELY, INCREDIBLY toxic, probably the worst I've ever experienced so far (more that LoL... yeah, I said it), the game is plagued with bugs that are slow being fixed and is generally unbalanced at the higher ranks.

One other issue I want to mention is "the grind", as people named it. It mostly hurts the new player experience; at the beginning you have to farm to unlock all the perks (that increase your effectiveness) - and this farm takes a very, very long time. In a competitive environment (that is, PvP), you will definitely feel the disadvantage until you catch up. I'm currently 200 hours in and still far from unlocking all the "desirable" killer perks.

All in all, the game has been out for two years and a half now, the devs are still carrying out a lot of work when it comes to new content; also, every new killer adds some mostly new gameplay, as every killer has unique mechanics.
The nature of the game makes it very hard to balance, so I can understand if it feels so unfair at the higher ranks. The devs are doing their best, though sometimes it feels to fall short.

I play it now and then, have some fun, usually quit at my second killer game because a survivor starts insulting me in chat and I get frustrated. Don't even try this game if you're easily annoyed.

first thing, this is NOT a horror/slasher simulaton
dbd is a asyncronous multiplayer with a mix of lovecraftian mythos + slasher horror movies on top to give flavour
if you are here searching for a "omg this gonna be so scary!" type of game, dbd is not the game for you

now, if like me you are a horror fan, welcome
this game is one of a kind game, i'v always wanted a multiplayer horror experience but it looks like most ppl have this dumb notion that horror should always be about the boos and scares... anyways, how the game works:

killers: basically the killer role is a time menagement, he chases the survivors to hook and sacrifice then, the game have a very refined game design so is a little bit hard for untrained minds to look in the "in betweens" thats why it frustrate most players that don't like to read info or hate to change their meta/perks. 
My tips to new killers: 
-don't camp the hooked survivor, it wastes your time and it may work with some survivors but it will not work with veteran players.
-put pressure on gens and use perks to counter gen rush
-pay attention to your add-ons and try to "combo" then with your perks
-don't be afraid of SWF(survive with friends) they play on a very autruistic way so they will try to make the 4 survive, unless you camp, then they will tell their mates and you will get 1~2 kills if you are lucky(or laggy)
-experiment with other perks combination, don't just watch you favorite dbd youtuber and say "off course, this perks are so OP..." and copy that loadout, pay attention to WHY is working and how the gameplay is unfolding
-waste that decisive strike early on the match
-if the chase is taking too long, find anoother survivor on the gens (remember, gens rush is your worst enemy)
-use headphones with a good audio
-play as survivor too, you need to think as your prey


Survivors: survivor role is a resource menagement, some may thing that survivor is easier to play than killer, but the team work factor is what acctually weights(matches with randoms have a very low chance of survival), if you play with good teamates the survival chance is high, but the killer can counter weight with memento moris(kill a survivor on the ground) and insta downs add-ons
My tips for new survivors:
-do gens
-open claudette perks, self care specially
-use at least one running perk(balanced landing or sprint burst)
-do gens
-pray for the killer not be the nurse
-stay calm and do gens
-have in mind that most of your actions make noise and alert the killer
-if you have less than 100h in this game, use claudette, she is the most stealth and hard to spot
-play as a killer, most good "survivor main" acctually play as killer too and this give you a great advantage of perspective over ppl who only play one role
-don't stay still on the same spot for too long or reavens will pocke you head
-and... do gens
I fell in love with Dead by Daylight just as I bought it and tried it for the first time in November 2017.
Its concept of being a 4vs1 horror game was so unique and fun to me I wanted to play it more and more.
The atmosphere, the music and overall thrilling experience is very cool and exciting.
Survivor gameplay and Killer gameplay are completely divers, it is basically two different games in one.
I enjoy being on both sides almost equally, usually playing Survivor when I want to have fun with my friends and playing Killer when I am alone.
Moreover, I am a fan of old classic horror movies like Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, A Nightmare on Elm Street and the characters from these films are presented in the game.
You can play as Michael Myers, Leatherface, Freddy Krueger as Killer or even Laurie Strode as Survivor.
I like the progression system and the ability to prestige as well, it keeps me motivated to play the game further.
The store was also a nice addition to Dead by Daylight in my opinion, as you can unlock most of the characters and customisation items by using the in-game currency which is earned by just playing the game.
Probably the most important thing about Dead by Daylight is that it is regularly being updated with seasonal events, balance patches and new content, including Killers, Survivors and Maps, which keeps the gameplay fresh.

All in all, Dead by Daylight is an amazing multiplayer game with an extremely high replayability and I would recommend everybody to try it out.
Unique and original concept with some ever increasingly bad flaws

Pros
-best co-op action in a game
-endless fun
-randomized level designs

Cons
-camping killers can ruin the experience
-teammates can farm of you while leaving you stranded or to die
-no dedicated servers (host can willingly lag everyone else in the game)

Dead by daylight has the most original concept for a game I have played in an extremely long time. You are a team of four survivors playing in 3rd person camera angle. You do not have any weapons and must work together in randomized level designs to activate 5 generators followed by unlocking the exit gate. You are also able to access an escape hatch if you have gotten 3/5 generators or are the last survivor remaining. While doing these task you must avoid the killer (1st person camera angle) who is attemping to hook you 1-3 times depending on if your teammates are able to save you (maximum of twice, dead on the 3rd hook). Each character (survivor and killer) has their own unique perks and become teachable amongst all the survivors.

    The problem with the game is killers are able to camp a hooked survivor and purposely lag the game for the other players, thus ruining the experience. Along with this the game has a bunch of bugs and glitches. Ever since the latest patch they have clearly shown favor in introducing cosmetics via micro transactions and less priority towards balancing the stability of the game. A new bug has emerged that will sometimes make your character unable to move (sometimes for the whole match) along with killers being able to hit you through a pallet it claims you stunned them with. One of the bigger issues I hate is if the killer (host) disconnects before the match even loads, your offerings will be consumed regardless of the match not even starting. In some instances this can also result in you loosing rank progress (PIP) without any control.

   Conclusion: The game is extremely fun and truly shines if you have a full team of friends to play and communicate with. Just be willing to except the occasional camping killer and glitches every so often. I would recommend buying the game but perhaps holding off on the DLC and other microtransactions (auric cells) until the devs put some of this money they made into fixing the stability of the game.

8/10
Its a good game, with a good idea, but we need some sort of suppport or report system, so many lag abbusers, assasins playing with survivors.

Need dedicated servers too.
An addicitve game for sure, but not without it's faults. Sadly, the commuity is far worse than any of the actual in game issues. The very nature of a 1v4 or 4v1 game, depending on which side you play, creates a rift between main's of both sides, each complaining ceaselessly about how the game is stacked against them. The forums are toxic, the pre and post game chat is typically toxic, and salt rains from the heavens no matter the match outcome. That aside, the game itself is actually enjoyable, and for as much as people complain, each profile you see will be demonstrating hundreds of hours spent in the fog. 

**PROS**
SURVIVORS:
-Escaping a match is satisfying, no matter what Rank you're on.
-Getting in with a decent team is a rare reward, and makes the experience much more enjoyable.
-Tense moments trying to rescue, gen work, or explore make the game worthwhile.
-Learning how to face each Killer is challenging, and fun to master. 

KILLERS:
-There's nothing more satisfying than throwing someone on a hook and watching them dangle helplessly. 
-Harsher and less forgiving learning curve that's satisfying to improve on.
-Ultra-Rare add-ons take survivors by surprise and make for quick, satisfying matches. 
-Unlike survivors, you have the ability to see your opponents in lobby and plan load-outs accordingly. 

**CONS**
SURVIVORS:
-90% of your teams will be horrible. Gen ignoring, Yolo saving, point farming, ragequitting, etc, etc, etc.
-You *need* to rely on the three other people on your team, and they tend to be your biggest handicap. (see #1)
-A survivor is just as much of a target for post-game salt if you play in a style that others don't agree with. (see #1)
-You will watch your Rank fall for situations completely out of your control. (again see #1, disconnecting kilers, etc)

KILLERS:
-Facing a 4-man SWF loadout, though much rarer than claimed, is completely stacked against you.
-Poor map design in terms of survivor assistance can have you running around for days after one person.
-Rework needs to be done to assist in Killer loadouts (better Hex totem design, etc)
-Rank Reset will have new Killers ready to uninstall the game after 20 mins. 

**THE GAME OVERALL**
PROS:
-Fun and addictive, with a learning curve that's obtainable but hardly forgiving.
-Prestige gives you targets to aim for.
-Some really good people in the game, and easy to make new friends in the right circumstances.
-Tense, close matches between Survivors and Killers make the entire experience worthwhile. 

CONS:
-You can get absolutely steamrolled on either side in certain matches.
-Bugs are constantly popping up, even when one is fixed, two more show up.
-No Region lock at all. This means you can spend 20 mins in lobbies trying to find a ping less than 200.
-Disconnects of any nature throw the game completely off, and something needs to be worked out. 
-The community at large is toxic as hell. 
-Imbalance of Perks leads to specific Meta builds on both sides of the game, creating a very generic experience. 
-Map design needs to be reworked in order to better balance the game. (Currently in progress)
-Certain Killers need to be reworked in order to make them viable. *cough* Freddy *cough*
-High Ranks (1,2,3) are basically the same maps, with the same killers, and same perk loadouts on repeat.

**FINAL THOUGHTS**
The premise and implementation of the game is great, and I understand that it's ridiculously hard to balance a game of this nature to where the majority of players are pleased. There's a reason why so many people have pumped hundreds, if not thousands, of hours into this game. The Devs are visible, they try to keep the community informed, and are always releasing new content, which is great, but I believe that more focus needs to be put into ensuring the core of the game is perfected first. If you're new, you're in for a rough ride, but it gets better, and much more enjoyable. There's alot of great aspects to the game, which makes it worth spending time in. You *will* get frustrated, you *will* have some absolutely horrible matches, but you "Join a Lobby" and take another stab at it. Overall, the good outweighs the bad in my opinion, and I trust the developers to keep chipping away at the monumental task that is balancing the game.
[h1]What is Dead by Daylight most similar to?[/h1]
Dead by Daylight is most similar to Friday 13th with some differences such as that Dead by Daylights maps are all procedurally generated for each match, there's more survivors in one match in Friday 13th and Friday 13th only have one killer (but with different weapons).

Dead by Daylight is also quite similar to Deathgarden from the same developer. It features a hunter that is trying to incapacitate & kill runners.

Dead by daylight is however the best game in the genre right now.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
A simplistic way to describe Dead by daylight would be to say that it's a cat & mouse game. 
You either play as the killer and try to stop the victims from escaping or you play as one out of 4 survivors trying to escape.

When playing a survivor you need to repair a certain amount of generators in order to power up the mechanism that unlocks the exit. Once all the generators are powered up you need to flip the switch that opens the exit & escape. 

Apart from activating the generators there's also the obvious goal of surviving and trying to save the other survivors if they've been caught on a hook. Your chances of winning are greatly enhanced while all of you are alive. 

When playing as the killer you try to incapacitate the victims so that you can lift them up and put them on a hook. The goal is to sacrifice them to feed to [i]the entity[/i]. The entity is some sort of demonic force in the game. While one victim is on the hook the remaining victims still run around trying to repair the generators so your best course of action is to try and chase them down and hook them as well. 

When the match is over your performance is graded and you're handed a certain amount of [i]bloodpoints[/i] that you can spend on new gadgets, offerings and abilities for a killer or survivor of your choice.

[h1]Killers, survivors & items[/h1]
You have a lot of options when it comes to selecting your killer or survivor. There's currently 13 killers and 14 suvivors. Each one with its own unique set of skills and abilities. On top of that there are a lot of gadgets & offerings. Gadgets help you in some way as a tool and often has a limited amount of uses. Offerings change how things will be played in the match. They could add thicker fog, seperate survivor players or enable the killer to insta-kill survivors rather than having to hook them for example. In combination with the map system it really mixes things up and makes matches feel fresh rather than the same thing repeating over and over again. 

[h1]Difficulty & imbalance[/h1]
The matchmaking is generally pretty good and the difficulty obviously varies depending on the skill of your opponents relative to your personal skill. It is however my firm belief that this game was never meant to be played with friends over voip. As the killer there is a huge difference in difficulty when you compare playing against a pre-made group of 4 victims with playing against a group of 4 randomly matched victims. 

In Dead by daylight there is no in-game chat or voip so whenever you play solo survivor you will not be able to communicate with the other survivors. If you play as a group you can communicate with the other survivors in a 3rd party voip software. This obviously gives the survivor team a huge buff since they can tell eachother where the killer is or what he's up to.

It really feels imbalanced when I run into pre-made groups as the killer & it makes me wonder why the developers did not adress it by giving randomly matched survivors a way of communicating & buffing the killers to balance it out. I've seen many other players that main killer say that they evade pre-made groups because of this.

Aside from that some killers feel a lot weaker than others but it's hard to say for sure since it could all come down to playstyle & you never know what the new "meta" could be.

[h1]Maps[/h1]
The map-theme is randomly chosen & then the map itself is procedurally generated at the start of the match and each map is more or less advantagious depending on what survivor or killer you're playing. There's plenty of themes, it works well and keeps the game fresh. No complaints at all.

[h1]Servers[/h1]
The servers are P2P & that is an issue that cause several problems. The killer is always the host of the session and since it's a P2P architecture that means that his machine holds all the information about the ongoing match. It means that the game is suseptible to lagswitches, cheats and even simple things such as the killer disconnecting.

If the killer disconnects using alt+f4 all of the survivors lose their gadgets and offerings because the P2P-server is no longer available to tell the main server what items they retrieved or used in the match. Behaviour gave their new IP Deathgarden dedicated servers and I hope they do the same thing for Dead by daylight sooner rather than later. 

With that said; it's rare to run into cheating killers or laggy matches. It works well for the most part.

[h1]Toxicity[/h1]
Toxicity is arguably one of the greatest problems with Dead by Daylight. The post-lobby chat that pops up only serves as a punching bag for the frustrated players that feel like they've been wronged in one way or another. If you do not engage in the chat you will often recieve messages on your Steam profile from angry players who feel like you did something cheesy. This happens very often no matter how you play the game.

I dont really know how they could solve the issue but the chat should be removed completely from the post-lobby. It serves no purpose but to give other players abuse. Some way of encouraging other players would be a step in the right direction as well. Perhaps a "tip" button of some sort? I dont know. But they really need to do something to lighten the mood & enforce punishments on players that take it too far.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]
It's the best game you can get if you're looking for an asymmetrical pvp game. 
The upsides greatly outweigh any downsides.
[h1][b]INTRODUCTION[/b][/h1]

I am a total slasher movie nut. My favourite character from the genre, Jason Voorhes, the protagonist of Friday the 13th, got an awful game to my great sadness. I wanted to like it, I really did, but no luck. So I picked my dignity up from the floors of the PlayStation Store and went back to good ole' Dead by Daylight. It is a game I've always been delighted to play, albeit it getting quite repetitive after some time (if you play survivor, or after you master your playable killers if you main said role). I have to admit there have been periods of time when it was just gathering dust in my library, but once I bought my first DLC, there was no going back. The entity had pulled me in.

[h1][b]THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM[/b][/h1]

Before I start judging the actual gameplay, I need to adress the thing that most of you might be looking at when opening the game's store page: the DLC. Why so much? Does it even help? Isn't it overpriced? To be very brief, this game is amazing even without any DLC. First of all, you can do great in the game without spending a single dime on the so-called "chapters" (since atm of writing this, the "strongest" killer is the Nurse, which is integrated in the vanilla character pool, and any survivor can do well in any tier). So, a Chapter gives you a new killer and a new survivor: 
1. Each survivor comes with 3 specific starting perks (see the "GAMEPLAY" section), which can be taught to other survivors by leveling them up until the perk becomes teachable, and will appear in the bloodweb of others OR you can purchase the perk directly with iridescent shards (the currency you earn for leveling up your account) if it appears in the Shrine of Secrets (a part of the store with 4 perks which refreshes every week) (*killer perks also available). Cool, right? Reason nr.1 you don't [b]have[/b] to buy any dlc.
2. Each killer and survivor that [b]isn't licensed[/b](from a movie, e.g: Leatherface, Freddy, etc.) CAN be purchased from the in-game store for iridescent shards. 
You can basically earn any content in the game that isn't licensed without spending real money. That also means the you can get the licensed characters' perks. But once you put enough hours in the game, you will want by yourself to purchase some DLC. After all, supporting devs is great!

[h1][b]GAMEPLAY[/b][/h1]

The premise is simple. 5 players. 1 killer, 4 survivors. Either escape as a survivor or kill all the survivors as a killer. A killer has a basic attack, a lunge (holding down the attack button will result in a longer range but proportionally higher exhaust time) and a special ability. If you miss the attack, you get an exhaustion time in which you look down for a bit and become slower, giving the survivor a very brief escape window. The exhaustion applies on landed attacks as well, but that time it's bigger. The special ability is different from killer to killer and can manifest itself in a variety of ways, such as placing bear traps, teleporting, throwing hatchets and much much more. Survivors are all the same gameplay-wise, having no special ability, thus only being affected by the various [b]perks[/b] in-game and by the item they go into the trial (match) with. Perks buff certain actions (see the killer's outline on the map for a certain amount of time when they break a pallet) or can act as a double-edged sword, buffing a certain aspect but also having some sort of side-effect (a sprint at 150% of your speed for a certain amount of time but leaving you exhausted for a time). Items are common things such as toolboxes, medkits, or flashlights, which break over time with usage and which are lost if you are killed in a match (but fret not, you'll get more than your fair share of items). Each item and perk has a rarity grade, indicating their efectiveness. Survivors have to repair 5 [b]generators[/b] (repair speed which can be increased by using a toolbox) and open the [b]exit gates[/b] of the killer's hunting grounds to win the game. The killer has to use [b]sacrificial hooks[/b] to get survivors out of the game for good. One hit injures the survivor, making them grunt and leave trails of blood, and 2 puts them in a dying state, at which point they can be picked up and carried to an aforementioned hook. During this time, survivors can wiggle in a last attemp to escape the killer's grasp. If they are put on a hook, they can be released by a fellow teammate or if their time expires they die (you can also attemp to escape on your own at the price of shortening the sacrifice time). Each time a survivor is put on the hook again, the sacrifice advances to a point in which they will be instantly killed if it is their 3rd time on a hook (at maximum). The survivor can also evade a killer by stunning them with a pallet (if dropped straight on them), placed very conveniently all across the map for your convenience. You can vault over the pallet but the killer needs to either consume precious time by breaking it or choosing an alternate route. The maps also offer a variety of windows you can vault over and ledges you can drop from. Of course there are millions of strategies, like tunneling, rushing the generators, stealth, pallet-looping and so on, some of which are considered [b]toxic[/b](see the "COMMUNITY" section) , but you will discover everything on your own once you get playing.

[h1][b]THE SYSTEMS[/b][/h1]

Remember when I said that you'll get plenty of items? Well, that is all thanks to the [b]bloodweb[/b], the character progression system. After a match you will get a certain amount of blood points based on your actions, regardless of the match result. The blood points are universal and you can spend them for any character, be it a killer or survivor, which makes playing with your main in order to level up another character a good pasttime. The bloodweb offers various items, item add-ons (you can start the trial with max 2 add-ons on the item of your choice) which buff the item's effects (or could as well have side-effects, just like perks) and perks (because there are also a good amount of universal perks, which you can "capture" in the bloodweb and level up a max 3 times depending on how many times you invested blood points in them). Killers and survivors also have ranks, which are shared among all killers/survivors. You are ranked from 20 to 1 (1 being the best rank), depending on how well you do in games. Finally, there is the general player level, which rewards you with the iridescent shards I mentioned above for every level earned. This might sound a bit complicated, but believe me, once you see it in-game it all becomes clear as day. I apologize for my poor explanation skills, but I hope I managed to make you curious (at least) about the game. Now, onto a more subjective matter...

[h1][b]COMMUNITY[/b][/h1]

Each game has toxic tryhards, but at least the lower ranks provide a safe haven from them in DBD. To make a long story short: killer mains accuse survivors of being toxic because of them using valid strategies for winning, and vice versa. Some survivors are indeed toxic (teabagging at the exit), just as some killers are (camping a hook). This is why some players derank on purpose, to taste the good side of the game again. The matchmaking can also be a bit dumb regarding this matter, since every now and then you [b]will[/b] get matched with someone 5 ranks lower or higher than you. That's just how life is, I guess. But as long as you remember that you play for FUN, you should be all good!

[h1][b]CONCLUSION[/b][/h1]

Dead by Daylight is the best assymetrical multiplayer game the market has to offer right now. It has a great slasher theme, combined with supernatural elements at times. You need not spend anything on DLC, but you will, once you see that the game deserves it. With an easy to learn, hard to master curve, DBD proves to be great fun, wether with friends or alone.
This may be one of the more difficult games to properly review, so I'm not going to try that much, you either love it or you hate it, yes, it's one of those. On one hand, you got the coolest idea for a multiplayer game: Hide and seek in a Slasher movie setting. On the other hand, it's a multiplayer game with a majorly toxic community, between people quitting games, complaining about the killers or the perks used, or complaining about the survivors, it's endlessly problematic, BUT, there are some nice and chill people as well, I've had the worst and the best experiences, so it's mostly a luck based draw, your teammates may be awesome, and they may be ragequitters, the killer can be really fun and challenging, or he can be a real camper that gets lucky with its hitbox, you never know.
The gameplay is solid, you play either as a survivor, which need to coordinate with other survivors to repair generators, so the doors unlock and you can escape the map. The Killer, needs to prevent the survivors from doing so, by hitting them and sacrificing them to the "Entity", it's extremely fun when everything goes your way, and extremely frustating when it doesn't.
I'd recommend this game for most people, there's only the catch about the actual community, which isn't the most pleasant, so, this was my pick for "better with friends" award, and I'd highly recommend it with friends, either unrank or rank, whatever. Get your friends together, and kill each other, or survive to live another day, it's fun! (Not irl though, don't do it irl).
To summarize, really fun game, incredible with friends, be ready for some toxic comments here and there, sometimes getting those "GG"s in between. To help out with that one problem, to put it simply, don't be an a**hole, have fun, complain to yourself, simple :)
There's been a recent update that has left lots of people unhappy because it nerfs the (objectively stronger) side of the game.

However, I believe a review should be based off of more than just one update. To that end my experience with the game has been great, both as killer and survivor. This is the game that I keep coming back to and nearly always enjoy. The Devs are very active and have done a lot to bring the game forward in the last few months.
I am torn how I feel about this game. I'd say I recommend it 60% and I don't recommend it 40%, if that makes sense.

Good things about it:
+Variety of killers and survivors.
+Progress system
+A new chapter every few months, which includes usually a survivor, a killer and a map.
+Spooky and with the addition of Spirit I shit my pants sometimes. Also Myers is one spooky boi.
+Amazing soundtrack
+Co-op
+Neaaaaaaaaaa ^v^

Bad things about it:
-Balance.
-Not dedicated servers (yet, but hopefully someday)
-Legion being antifun... I still play them tho so I am a hypocrite :x
-Toxicity. As a killer you face this way more than as a survivor, atleast from my experience. But to be fair I am toxic as well sometimes if my meter fills up :)))))))))))))))))))))))
-Rank system doesn't have any rewards, also rank resetting leaves the mid ranks to be a fuckfest of toxic players holding the game hostage, teabagging etc. This happens RARELY but still notable, as it's not a pleasure.
-HITBOXESSSSSS
-Co-op (if you are playing killer it's hell to face a 4 stack)


More negatives than positives but... there's just something about this game that's so... different. It gives me a thrill as I am a person who is easy to scare and easy to amuse. This game causes so many different emotions that it's insanely fun at times, but insanely frustrating sometimes as well.

Overall, I'd say buy this game if you can live with some balancing issues ( :^) )
I've been expecting to play this game as much as possible, in order to give a more honest and detailed review.
I'll start with the notes:
Graphics 10/10;
Mechanics 8/10;
Bugs 7/10;
Details 8/10;
The game was released in 2016, we are in 2019 and the game has no dedicated servers....
99% (I'm not exaggerating) games have dedicated servers....
Note game 8/10, although I really like the game there are some problems which pull the game down,down(which you can see above).
I wouldn't call this a horror game per se. After the first few times you play it, the scare factor is gone and you're left with playing hide and seek with the killer which is fine with me because it is an aspect that i feel DBD got right. I really do enjoy this game and being sneaky is always fun BUT the most recent updates to the game have done nothing but ruin it. The atmosphere is no longer creepy, everything feels unrewarding, the levelling and ranking system is broken (It's a grind), and the cosmetics system is a huge, disappointing money-grab. But it is what it is. >:P  
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
DBD can be very fun and very frustrating. Shyt happens sooo people need to get over it. Some maps give survivors more advantages while others give them to the killer. You can always pick an offering to increase your luck or to choose your favourite map, etc. You do need some experience to play it right though. The graphics look great as well. The game play is easy to pick up.. it's just a fun game with friends. I have met some great people on this game and I've enjoyed playing in groups and cooperating together to escape. It's no fun when you're being tunnelled constantly but sadly that's how some people play. It can get intense trying to stay alive but you will die more than you will survive. Facts. At times you will think it is unfair and even unbalanced but gradually with each level of experience you learn to move into a situation where you have the skill to evade against the killer. It gets more competitive as you rank up but the excitement to escape is the fun that this game promises you. Playing the killer is loads of fun too but you'll get lots of toxic people whining about the way you play as well even if you're playing fair; people just love to complain. 
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
The main theme is bangin' too... >:O
8/10
3/5 game. If you dont get hooked on this game, and accept its many, and i mean MANY, flaws you will hate it. 
As a survivor you will face many games that leave you with a feeling that it is the killer that is op and the game does not work as its supposed to. 
As a killer you will face many games that leave you with a feeling that survivors are op and the game does not work as its supposed to.
There is game abuse and all the issues you can imagine. After every patch the game seems to be getting a little bit more broken than the last patch. I recommend trying it out with a bunch of friends, or even strangers, but with a team of people. Dont take the game too seriously or it will get to you. Take a load off and fire this bad boy up to get some good giggles of hilarious jukes and moments. Get a good laugh out of it with friends. 
Solo que is a dark path, dont ever go there.
[b]+++[/b] Lots of variety when it comes to survivors, killers, items and perks

[b]+++[/b] Infinite replayability

[b]++[/b] Fresh concept and unique gameplay

[b]++[/b] Moderately satisfying progression system

[b]++[/b] Being able to buy some customization items and even playable characters using in-game currency

[b]++[/b] Music and ambient is good, horrifying even. One of the songs that plays when you're the killer makes me physically ill in real life. It is that uncomfortable

[b]++[/b] Seasonal events, updates, patches

[b]+[/b] Customization. Some of it even given away for free



~ Odd hit detection. Sometimes it works in your favor, sometimes it doesn't

~ Community is kinda weird. Lots of rage quitters and toxic people who choose to wait 20 minutes for you to finish the game and enter the lobby, where they can finally let out their frustrations and flame you properly. But at the same time I also made a bunch of friends and got a lot of helpful tips from complete strangers

~ Easy to learn, difficult to master

~ While ripping the game audio I found some VR-related files. And I would just like to say that if this game ever gets a first-person VR mode for both survivors and killers.. It's gonna become a top-seller over night!



[b]---[/b] Constant crashes and disconnects. One time me and my friend got disconnected from the lobby nine times in a row before we got in

[b]---[/b] Bad animations

[b]---[/b] A lot of the models look bad and there's even some broken ones where the character mesh is outright pulled outwards or pushed inwards

[b]--[/b] Graphically stuck in 2013

[b]--[/b] Voice acting. Absolutely zero dialogue, no custom lines for a lot of actions such as memento moris. The characters just spam the same 5 "hurt" sounds in a quick succession instead of a custom long voice line

[b]--[/b] Microtransactions. Some items and playable characters are locked and can only be purchased with real currency

[b]-[/b] Lore. There is none. It is kept "secret" on purpose and left for us to discover when really there's nothing to it. It's just shallow and boring and what little there is on Wiki is a joke

[b]-[/b] The Killer is always the host. So if that person crashes, disconnects or downloads something - you're gonna be the one suffering the most



[b]Conclusion[/b]: It's an OK asymmetric ShooterGame™ (inside joke about how all U4 games have this generic folder called ShooterGame or CookedPC). Unstable, ugly, badly animated, but fun! Even more fun with friends. Especially when the survivors and the killer are evenly matched.

Good luck!
Yeah, its good, with a few exceptions. If you like these types of games, this is one of the best ones up there. Unfortunately, there aren't other games with this kind of gameplay, so if you haven't learned the game beforehand, your experience might be less positive than others. I'd recommend watching other people play this game to get the gist of the meta before immediately jumping in.

Positives:
[*]Fun game with friends
This game is best played with 4 other people you know, with voice communication with all of your (assumed) friends. You'll have a blast. Nothing to it.
[*]Interesting and original progress system
The bloodweb system is super cool (to me). By doing the right things, you get bloodpoints, which you can use to buy stuff in a character's bloodweb. By "completing" a bloodweb, that character levels up, and a new bloodweb is randomly generated. 
[*]Still has active devs
Writing this just after Lunar New Year event with new stuff. Plus balance patches.
[*]Fun for weird nerds like me
It's like being in a horror movie, and you can choose which kind of person you want to be (guy who always dies first, fearless leader, merciless killer, etc). If your into that stuff, wait until 50% off because it happens a lot and you get get super savings.

Negatives:
[*]Ranking system is broken
Seasons reset and killers with a super build can go against potato players. Consistently. I'm sure there's a better way to matchmake, right?
[*]Throwing is extremely detrimental
If you have an early disconnect, killer basically wins every single time (unless potato)
[*]Online random multiplayer can be kinda cancer
No good multiplayer game is without a [b] toxic [/b] community
[*]DLC is much expensive
I'm broke, and I can't buy all DLC because I'm broke. You really need all the DLC to get the fullest experience out of the game.
[*]Unfriendly to toasters
Can't directly change to a specific resolution, making this game run at around 40 frames on my toaster. If you don't use a toaster, good for you, capitalist scumbag.

In short, if you know what you're doing, and don't use a toaster, the game is basically like the Overwatch of 4v1 multiplayer with some tweaks here and there. If you got this far, I probably haven't convinced you that this game is worth $20+DLC. In that case, I'm sorry that I can't share how addicted I am to this game. Thank you for your patience, and I hope you won't report this post.
very fun game, at first i didn't know to much about it and stopped but when you learn the game it gets real intresting and is a lot of fun can either have fun solo or with a group of friends
This game makes you overthink every move you make, thinking you may be making to much noise, screwing up on a skill check only to be certain that the person who is trying to murder the **** out of you is notified of it. 

Surviving with friends is fun, communication is key; or you can survive by yourself in a group, and develop the worst case of bad trust issues, which I highly recommend. Of course, you can always take on the role of the killer and terrorize people yourself which is one hell of a good time. 

In general I think the game is really good, if you're just starting you may have trouble surviving against some of the tougher killers, but the learning curve for survivor isn't that steep and you'll start escaping more regularly the more you play.
Not bad overall but is a little glitchy and buggy at times about half a year ago it was a buggy mess with balancing issues but now its fine and there are actual good cosmetics still buggy and glitchy
50/50 
I like the game and it's really fun sometimes...
Let's get into the downsides to the game:

-Ranking system, The ranking system is just terrible. Reaching rank 1 gives you nothing but a shitty achievement that doesn't really matter. You get no rewards and usually run into the same people at least 3 times a day. The lobbies are horrible as the killers are probably live halfway across the world from you so the ping is terrible. It might take you up to 15 minutes just to find a lobby with at least 120+ ping
-SWF makes the game unenjoyable and frustrating if you are facing a really strong team as the game was never built around voice chat and they can call out your position and know your next move all the time.
-The bugs and hitboxes are annoying as fuck noticable mostly in killers such as Nurse and Huntress.
-Legion and Nurse are extremely broken characters, if the killer knows what they are doing it can be really frustrating and abuse of some addons and mechanics can be almost unbeatable.
-Hatch standoff, Yep I know this topic gets mentioned a lot in the community but there is litteraly nothing you can do if you play killer i'll just keep this point short as you've probably heard this brought up a billion times.
-Not going to mention perks such as NOED and DS as DS is getting a re-work and it probably won't be long until they change their mind about NOED.
-The community, oh boy... If you play killer expect to be called every insult under the sun and reported at least 3 times per match. Rank 1 survivors constantly tea bagging and sandbagging teammates. 

Now good things and things I personally enjoy about the game.

-If you just want to chill out it's a pretty good game, I know I sound hypocritical because I whined about it in the points above but playing with friends is pretty fun, If they found a correct workaround tryhard gen rushing swf discord squads then it would be better but it's either we play solo all the time or we have to deal with the consequences of losing to a group of friends that may be tryharding, Idk maybe i'm just looking too in depth on this one.
-Looking forward to Dedicated servers and more events, Events are fun and give the player base things to do in the meantime instead of getting bored of the same concept of doing gens and escaping.
-Good variety of perks and new characters getting added into the game usually consisting of 1 survivor a killer and a new map.

My verdict - I say get it if you want to or if it is on sale and its just a game you want to play from time to time to chill out and have fun on go ahead. I personally still love the game and can find it enjoyable most of the time but unexpected changes and avoiding suggestions from the community will run this game into the ground.
I hope this gave you a general view on my perspective of the game. 


WARNING: Parents, this is not meant for kids, special snowflakes, or the squeamish. The setting is a horror movie in which an overpowering psychotic killer, often with supernatural powers, is trying to kill 4 young adults. You either play as the killer or as 1 of the 4 trying to escape alive by fixing 5 generators that power the gates through which to escape. The killer's role is to be as sneaky, underhanded, and brutal as possible to get the 4 on meat hooks as sacrifices to a demonic Entity that feeds on emotions of crushed hopes, fear, and torture. The killer doesn't have to be nice, does not have to "play fair", does not have to coddle. If you buy the game the point is to get terrified & brutalized or be the one who does it to 4 other players. (Not for kids, remember.)

If you've got the stomach for it & good sportsmanship, hell, yeah, it's fun. 


I play essentially surv with my friends, so I will talk in consequence.

That's a great co-op game, with simple mechanics. The game will be harder if you level your rank up.
There is also new contents every 2-3 months i think.
A lot of ways to play survivor or killer, which make each game pretty unique.

Don't take games too seriously, some people can be really toxic xD
Playing with friends will give you a lot of fun, but if you wanna play alone, i may recommend that you play killer :)
I would definitely recommend this game :) it's fun to try and get the achievements and play with friends who are far away.
There are some toxic people but overall the community is good.
My favourite game! Has some issues like how the way that people play with one another is based on a peer to peer system. Other than that the game is regularly getting content updates as well as bug fixes and other things. Solid game to get!
A great, unsettling game where you can be hunted with your friends, play as a killer or a mix of both.
I seriously enjoy the asymmetrical gameplay, where one very powerful killer has to find a bunch of (sometimes more, sometimes less) elusive survivors. It's been some time, since I really had this emotional gameplay, this game provides. If you like the thrill of the hunt, I can really recommend this game.
definitely the most fun I've ever had with a game, but damn this game suffers a lot from bad internet connection, as the killer is also the host of the match and servers are to be released in the summer of 2019, and also from countless bugs that often cause unfair advantages for the killer or the survivors. 
this game will however never get boring and I always find myself coming back to it, but this game is sadly far from being properly playable. 100% worth the experience, but it might ruin your life as well.
Best game among multiplayer horror survival genre but needs a good server maintenance

Pros:
1. Separate rank system for both survivor and killer
2. Good variety of killers and some really takes time to master
3. Good progression system
4. Mind games are intense as survivor
5. Fun with friends
6. This game forces you to play as a team as survivor but also allows you to be selfish in different situations

Cons:
1. Very very grindy
2. Matchmaking as killer takes 10-20mins queues for some regions
3. Very hard match ups as killer against a whole group of survivors in voice chat
4. P2P server if killer lags then its gg for survivors
5. Some perks are op in high ranked games
good game and the challenging to survive i liked this game so much , the most bad thing about it is that they nerf and buff some killers perk so  it changeable by time and the camping and tunneling by some killers
Far from being a good game but still enjoyable.
PRO:                                                                
-funny                                                           
-excellent progression system                      
-constantly updated                                       
-many killer and survivors                               
-presence of cinematographic icons
-not pay to win

 CONS:
-unbalanced
-toxic community
-presence of bugs
-frustrating gameplay (sometimes)
-poorly optimized
I recommend this game! It's fun but playing with friends is even more fun! I just have a few issues, first one is when I drop pallets my character is glitched in the "idle" pose so when I'm running it looks like I'm fliying. Second thing, I don't like to wait 30 minutes in a lobby as a killer just to see one guy join and then leave. There is big wait time for a killer, but anyway these few things are gonna get patched, this is amazing game anyways! Good job for developers and sound team who are responsible for all creepy sounds!! Enjoy your game people
This game should add more game modes or allow people to mod !? 

Game mode where survivors can talk to eachother and the killer can talk aswell, would be funny af !
The endless supply of bugs and toxicity bring the game down quite heavily. However, if you're willing to look passed these problems, it can be a genuinely enjoyable experience with a lot to unlock and some interestingly diverse killers.
After playing for few hours game is more fun with friends! But its alright if you play solo because your teammater will be shiet anyway :)) Some killers camp but that happens like 30% of the time.

Graphics : OK 
Gameplay : Really fun and sometimes spooky
DLC : Some killers OP or stupidly unfair to play against (my opinion) (legion, the hag...)
People : Mixed (Toxic X fun to play againts, Kids X adults)
Price : Its better in sale (dont buy deluxe pls) 

9.4/10 will play again :))
I have around 800 hours on this game in total on this game and it's definitely had it's ups and downs and the game is going downhill very quickly lol but I would still recommend this because the concept of the game is still great no matter how unbalanced it is, you can still get some fun from it.
best game ever made. dwight is gay, and i got touched by bill in areas i dont want to speak about, btw nea and feng min are my girls if u go near them i stg i will shank u
Not gonna lie, I have really loved playing DBD, and would recommend it if you want to work with friends to survive against a killer, or if you want to hunt down a group yourself. 

However, it is worth mentioning that the mechanics in this game allow for many toxic players to ruin the game. For the most part, the devs have tried to balance the cooperative advantage of the survivors with the more powerful solo killer. However, in my experience many killers will camp or tunnel particular survivors, detracting from the fun of the game.

Otherwise, I would recommend anyone to try this game. Despite it's horror classification, it isn't too scary (although their are occasions where the killer can make you jump!), and you have the freedom to experiment with different items, characters and perks to keep the game fresh. Additionally thanks to DLC, there is also an option to play as some characters from popular horror franchises.
It is one those rare games where you can still easily get scare even after playing it for hours.
Totally recommended whether or not you are planning to play it with your friends.
I think the game is pretty fun, but the community is divided. Some people are really nice but there are others that are really toxic people. There are a lot of bugs in the game but overall it is a fun game. I love looping and being a pimp. You can even moonwalk. xD
This game is 50% toxic, 40% bugs, and 10% a joke.

People either take the game way too seriously, or literally not at all (farming killers/survivors)

It has fun moments.

Perk based game like CoD4; too many boring metas

Killers and Survivors are both OP, change my mind.

Feels like DLC and perk balancing is prioritized over fixing actual bugs/exploits

Profile is misleading; I have over 2k hours on Xbox (controller pleb lives matter)

Ranking system is a joke, rank 1 survivor (see above)

Still enjoy the game for some strange reason.
I love this game! 
It's my all time favorite. I can't get enough. 
Keep the good content coming! 

And remember, Wakanda is Forever. 

P.S: I don't like the spirit. She's pretty, but a bully to go against.
Extremely fun game. I rarely get bored of playing it. 
Cons:
    - No dedicated servers (but they're apparently coming out summer 2019)
    - Very toxic players as you rise in rank (low rank is just casual players mostly)
    - Many bugs and exploits that will nearly make you rage some matches
Pros:
    - If you can get past toxicity and play around it, you'll enjoy every game
    - Lasts 10-20 minutes max
    - Constantly being updated to get rid of bugs and apply balances
    - Michael Myers is a playable character
    - Very spooky game, and must play with sound.
Fun to play with friends but unless you are great at the game or don't ever get into a troll game its very hard to move up in rank. This was the main game to play with my friends and it held our interest for more then a year before we started to lose interest. The new killers weren't great and no one play the new killers so you never know the best strategy against them with its a rarity to play against them. Also to many movie based killers and not enough original, I really liked the original killers.

FEW HOURS LATER......

Now it's time to hide into the basement!
Game is very fun to play, regardless if you're the killer or a survivor (Although the game is more heart wrenching when you are the survivor). However, I feel the game is very fun for casual players only. Once you begin to get very good at the game and get thrown into matches with better players, the game takes a very repetitive approach. The killers & their perks, as well as the survivors & their perks become very repetitive due to how horrible certain things are in the game. If you want to be the best killer in the world on PC, your chances are significantly lower if you were to choose a killer like..... Freddy. If you are a survivor, you will learn VERY quickly which perks you are probably going to use every game. The developers have no plans in balancing the game as a whole, as they have already stated that some killers & certain perks are meant to be "fun", and not competitive. This makes NO sense, because they are trying to define what "fun" is for everyone. For me personally, "fun" involves winning, BUT NOT with the same killer or perks EVERY SINGLE GAME. I would enjoy the game a lot more if I had the same chance winning, no matter what killer or perks with survivors I use. You might get unlucky and get a map that none of your perks or killer are any good at, but that's alright. To sum it up, if you are looking to play this game casually and have some fun surviving or killing survivors, then this game is perfect for you. If you are looking to play a game you plan on becoming the best in because of how competitive you are, this is not the game for you. There are plenty of other games that will offer you a better chance at being competitive. Games at higher ranks will become more and more frustrating. Not because the people you are playing with are getting better, but because you have no freedom in what killer you want to kill with, or what perks you want to use as a Survivor.

One last thing.... I am a killer mostly, and this review is definitely based more on the side of the killer. However I feel there are definitely truths to what I'm saying involving survivors, as I feel survivors aren't as restricted, but still face the same struggles as killers.
Not really what I was expecting...

Okay, so when my friend told me about this game I thought he said "Death by Delight". So , you know, I thought it was going to be like ice cream, and pizza, and like junk food and stuff like that. I get that its death you die in like every video game lol but i thought it was gonna be with like cool shit and snacks and stuff. I wanted to play it so I had my mom put money in my steam wallet so I could get it. But, when I actually got in the game it was the complete opposite. It was like all scary shit and monsters. Theres this guy running around attacking you and hell take you and put you on a meat hook and you get like eaten by monsters and shit! The game honestly wasnt that bad but I think it would be better if it was like nice shit that was killing you instead. idk just my opinion.
not gonna lie, this game makes me scream like a lil bitch every time i play it.

but it's honestly only fun when you play with friends.

and if people would stop LAG-SWITCHING all the damn time, i'd give the game a solid 10/10.

despite all that, i would recommend getting it if you're looking for a good scare.
Very Friendly and helpful community :) 

If you play as a killer:
- you are tunneler
- you face camp
- you use op perks
- you lag switch

if you play as a survivor:
- toxic t bagger
- gen rusher
- toxic flashlight user 
- toxic insta medkit user
- noob not doing generators
- you use op perks

And don't worry, if you do any of these... people will tell you about it on your steam profile comments :)

Dead by daylight is a scary game...

For the first few hours, after that it becomes a sport and a very fun one at that. Whether you play survivor alone or with friends it can be excited even after 400+ hours. As for killer, well that's a whole other way to play the game if that floats your boat. The game has been cracking down on the bugs recently and in the 1 year that I have played this game I can say it is definitely worth playing, especially in summer when they introduce dedicated servers.

10/10 Love this game, I recommend it :)

In all seriousness the game is good just a few bugs :D
I'll make it quick- Do NOT buy this game if you expect to win. If you want to have a fun time, and you aren't too competitive, I would recommend this game! It's very enjoyable at points, and it provides a great time with up to 4 other friends in kill your friends, and 3 other friends in survive with friends.
The game in the current state is balanced and there are no op perks or killers.
Not like back in the day.
Community is still toxic asf but not as bad when i started playing.
TL:DR The game requires a ton of time and practice. Also one of my main complaints is being fixed in summer 2019.

In my short time playing this game, I've come to have this love-hate relationship. The main reasons why I love this game is that it's so much fun surviving with friends. It's also fun to occasionally farm with killers and survivors alike during events. The game has conceptually perfected the 1 vs. X multiplayer horror genre. I love the regular references to horror classics with cosmetics, as well as the original characters themselves when it comes to the killers. When surviving, I love that the game really flourishes when everyone wants to win as a team, rather than go for the hatch every game. When solo surviving, I feel like I can not only work with everyone, but when it all falls through, I can still win by finding the hatch, or outplaying the killer.

Summary of pros:
- Fun with friends
- Original characters are neat
- Great 1 vs. X multiplayer Horror
- Don't need to win as a team
- Overall friendly community during events

That said, there is a lot that does keep me from enjoying the game to it's fullest. While there's a ton of nice players in the community, I've had an equal amount of run-ins with the most diarrhetic shits this game could offer. This isn't far off from other online games, but whenever I run into them, it's at the worst of times. They fixed this, but I also had a big problem with D-strike in the game. It just sucked when you're about to 4-man, and your obsession strikes you and gets the hatch. Also when others are surviving with friends, one of them would sacrifice themselves in order to spoil the perks to the other three, which makes the game just not as fun. Equally speaking, DC's heavily cripple the game if you're surviving. In my last  spree of matches, I've had at least one every match. This ends me with the final issue, and is the main reason why I've held off dedicating a lot of time into the game. This game is lacking what is so desperately needed; dedicated servers. It's terrible to play a game where you're left having to test ping every lobby. It's even worse when it benefits the killer. I noticed that this game had a couple tournaments as well. If that's the direction Behavior wants to take, they need to implement dedicated servers, or we'd have an issue similar to what happened early on in For Honor's release. I'm happy to know that they will add dedicated servers in the summer of 2019. So the non-intentional DC's, exploits, and loading screen crashes will greatly decrease.

Summary of cons:
- As many toxic players as there are friendly players
- [strike] D-Strike[/strike] fixed February 2019
- Regular DC's and exploits (fixed with Dedicated servers)
- [strike] No dedicated servers [/strike] FIXED SUMMER 2019

Score: [i] 8.5/10 Nea best killer don't @ me.[/i]
Absolutely love this game. Have been playing for a couple of weeks and it's not getting old for me yet. One thing I do not like so far is that sometimes the loading screen while waiting to join a game freezes and just keeps ... loading. So I have to End Task and then start the game over. My laptop runs pretty quickly so it's not like it takes a long time, but it is a bit frustrating at times. 

The game is super fun, though. I am not hella competitive, so I see every game as fun rather than annoying. Every now and then something new happens and scares the bejeezus out of me. I do not like the Hag. She is creepy af.
Don't think, just buy it. You will not regret it. It is so much fun, especially as a group. 4 times a year a new DLC comes out and there's a new killer/survivor, keeping the game interesting and fun.
I really wish i could select neutral but in typical steam fashion they still don't have this as option several years in valve just contiune's to do nothing other then swim in their le epic 30% Gabe Newell tax but that's not the point of this review.
Anyways the game is fun, fun-ish most of the time when you get a match that's not total dog shit.
The game heavily favors the killer over the survivors which is kind of expected considering there's 1 of him and 4 idiots running around. This would also be fine but the killer(s) are so immensely powerful and there's literally nothing you in your power in about 40% of situations. For example if a killer can run faster then you, your options quickly become limited, you'll either need to have some sort of abilty of your own done through perks, be in a really good spot on the map to your advantage or get lucky and have a killer who doesn't know the difference between their mouse and keyboard.
there's so much in this game that the killers get in their arsonal that it becomes a problem quickly i haven't even scratched the surface with me talking about them being able to move faster above. i could overlook all of this if it wasn't for how the leveling and character and item system was handled that's the biggest issue with me.
you get blood points by completing actions in the game such as escaping repairing generators and healing friends all that good stuff right, anyways you get blood points and take them to your skill tree, and this is where the logic ends the entire tree is 100% RNG based, and it sucks because most of the characters you can choose from have a play style, a mechanic doesn't need a medkit and a medic doesn't need a toolbox, and some guy running around the map as a distraction really doesn't need a toolbox. on top of that items have addon's to make them more effective and there's offering which is like a global buff at the start of the round, this makes matters even worse because now a mechanic has a med-kit that he doesn't want, and spare gauze and bandages for his medkit that he doesn't want and buff that rewards you with more points for healing people that the mechanic never wanted to heal in the first place. the same goes for our medic friend now hes got a whole array of tools from protective gloves and scrap metal and a buff that makes it easier to repair shit that you didn't want to repair. If this wasn't bad enough i got into the game when the chinese new year was happening you know the big event for like half the planet while the other half kinda just scratches their butt a bit? anyways this also wouldn't be a problem if now tool box's med-kits and other tools are being replaced with chinese fireworks and other chinese decorations that don't help even nearly as much as some actual items. you can't opt out of events either so you're pretty much stuck with that item. The items you get for use in game aren't trade-able either so its not like a medic and mechanic can just swap unwanted items, even if you could do this it wouldn't matter because items are bound to character so Mr-mechanic trading with Mrs-medic because it would just move Mr-mechanics med-kit to Mr-medics mechanic character this also makes it so you can't just take all you items/perks/offerings you earned and move them to the person you need. to do that you need to hit the max level and prestiege in call of duty fashion.
Perks are the second huge issue, it takes a very long time to get them, they're bound per character until you reach a high level and a vast majority of them are useless or far far to situational to ever be useful, some of the perks are 100% dependent on the enemy playing a certain killer that you won't know who it is until its too late to pick perks. you can only guess. For example there's a perk that alerts survivors to traps within 12 meters of them. pretty useful so you don't fall into a dangerous bear trap and get murder hobo-ed right? wrong. only a single killer can place traps and hes not often played. if you picked this perk thinking the trapper would be played and he wasn't it's a waste of a perk that will do nothing for the rest of the match. Since perks are really hard to get every perk is precious and it makes it all the more disapointing when you get "this perk alerts you to the killers location for 5 seconds upon escaping the map, provided its the 3rd Friday of the month only at any time between 11am-11pm unless the US government is shutdown during the time there is a republican majority in the house, and  you're mothers, mother hasn't passed on and has eaten a chicken sandwich with buffalo sauce in the past 48 hours."
anyway that's my rant for now half this shit doesn't even matter to people with 500 or more hours on the game, which is a shame i want to have fun too not just die over and over until i have enough wacky bucks.
recommend for now.
A great coop game, 
suffers a bit from the non dedicated  servers which is hopefully moved to dedicated in august.

Constant updates and add-ons keep the game fresh.
Sigh... this is the hardest review I've had to write.

This game is interesting, compelling, and original. The game mechanic is great. The CORE game mechanic actually changes from movement to stealth in a way I've never experienced, even in metal gear games. Its exhillerating being chased and killed as the survivors and its fun to run around killing as the killer.

Unfortunately, the game is riddled with bugs. This current update (2/13/2017) made the game unplayable. And that's not me bitching about minor changes in game play mechanics... its literally broken and won't launch. 

I've held off my review in hopes that the developers would patch the game so i can rave about it up and down. Welp the cows have come to pasture and I feel that after playing 120 hours of the game, posting on steam forums about bugs, participating in test servers, and emailing devs all to have a patch that renders the application completely useless i think I've earned the right to bitch about it. Hell, I'm a paying consumer so why not?

Yesterday I played this game almost all day and night long. In that day, after hearing about the new patch I logged every game I was able to get into and play as well as every game that crashed due to errors. 

My logs for yesterday are as Follows:
68 attempted games played
51 games that did not load, crashed, errored out etc.
17 games succesfully laucned with no errors and were played

That means the application worked correctly only 25% of the time. 

All I can say is to stay away from this game. Its not working anymore... and even on its best days it only worked 1 out of 4 times.

If you happened to purchase this game and enjoyed it as much as I did (when it decides to work), put pressure on those devs. Thier game, as fun as it may be, is a defective product.  IT needs to be fixed or WE need to be reimbursed. You pay thier salary... not Behavior, not StarBreeze... YOU!

PS, Devs... I will personally remove this post and give it an incredibly positive and equally lengthy review once the game starts working as it should. It is not my intention to keep people from buying YOUR games... it is only to keep people from buying BROKEN games.

PPS, Devs... after fixing this game, how likely would it be to see another crossover monster/survivor combo?  I really wanna see a Ripley / Xenomorph or James Sunderland / Pyrimid Head update (just play Konami for the license you dicks, its dirt cheap right now)
"The Game" itself is really awesome and has a ton of potential, but unfortunately "The Systems" around the game NEED SERIOUS WORK.

[olist]
[*]The Rank System is too difficult and counter intuitive to the game itself, at times. Winning too fast and totally dominating the match can Rank you down. Being too good at the game can Rank you down. You need to play "to farm" instead of "play to win" most of the time. It's not a very enjoyable experience to play Ranked in this game.

[*]The Options/Settings have nothing for keybinds, sensitivity settings, and has lackluster resolution/graphic settings.

[*]The Lobby/Matchmaking System completely sucks. No way to Dynamic Queue with friends, it matches people-up with WILDLY different MMR/Skill-levels, and Queue-Dodgers do not get time-outs that should increase with each lobby that is dodged. People are constantly queue-dodging lobbies, which makes starting an actual match and playing the game a nightmare at times.

[*]The Disconnect/Network System does not auto-reconnecting players back to a game when they disconnected, even if they log-back-in within less than a minute. Also, disconnected player's character models disappear from the game world, instead of being left in the game to be interacted with, like how League of Legends does it. There is also a ton of lag in-game some times while other games are amazing with no lag. It can be wildly different between matches, and you never know what you're going to get. Rage-Quitters do not get punished right now, which is a real problem. They need to get time-outs for joining new games that should increase the duration for every game that they disconnect from and they should also lose Rank points, while the players that are left in their game matches need to get Bloodpoints rewarded for the disconnected player who they cannot farm from anymore.

[*]The Anti-Cheat/Exploit Systems ARE NOT WORKING and there are obvious cheaters/exploiters in the game. People with Prestige and Level 50, with 4 Ultra Rare Perks, but only have 5 hours of game time played is an impossibility. Behaviour Interactive's Competitive Esports Team needs to start taking a stance against cheaters, right now, as it's only going to get increasingly worse as more cheats/exploits are discovered.

[*]The Server System is non-existent. This game should have been a Client-Server architecture, but instead they went with P2P and saving Player Data on the Client. This is a HORRIBLE idea, which is just asking for cheating/exploiting/lag-switching. The game should have had dedicated servers, where our Player Data lives at, and where matches take place on. Dedicated servers would have made the game experience WAY BETTER. What a huge missed opportunity.

[*]The Company itself (Behaviour Interactive) has been super bad with their Community Managers and Esports Team, when it comes to communicating and addressing issues with the community and competitive players on the Steam forums. Their Competitive Esports Team needs to start actively revoking game licenses and banning cheaters from the game, naming and shaming them on their official website (like Blizzard does), and also posting in regards to what is and what is not acceptable play within the game, so everyone who plays Ranked matches has a baseline of what they should and should not do within a said Ranked match.
[/olist]

Again, the game itself is good and has potential, but the systems that surround the game are really beyond freaking horrible and too frustrating to make for an enjoyable experience at the moment.
Dead by Daylight is a fun concept and starts out entertaining enough but the many bugs, balancing issues, toxic community and a seemingly oblivious/incompetent development team keep me from recommending it to any new players.

The game's concept is fun enough: Play as one of four young adults desperately trying to repair five generators to open the gates and escape from a murderous stalker taken from slasher film tropes.  Or, play as the killer and hunt those kids foolish enough to stumble across your lair.  As you gain experience, you can buy perks and gain access to items to help you escape or kill.  When you start the game, it's a fun, heady experience.  Unfortunately, like a piece of fruit-striped gum, the initial rush is quickly gone.

Technical bugs abound, from minor glitches like non-working scoreboards and graphical glitches to moderate issues like broken perks to major issues like all of your game progress being eliminated (the devs recommend you make your own manual save copies) or "infinite loading screens" where the game locks up.  Of course, sometimes it just takes 2-5 minutes to load so you can waste a bit of time on nothing before determining if you're bugged or not.  Even if you weren't bugged, a team mate may be and they drop out leaving you down survivors before the game even starts.  Other issues exist in development choices: the matchmaking is simply terrible and often sticks your Rank 20 newbie with Rank 1-5 opponents leaving you hopelessly outclassed. Region matching is also terrible where the game can't find matches for you -- I am better off seeking a game in Ontario rather than my home region of Chicago because the game will just hang.  Then there are numerous balances issues and exploits that go unresolved.

Frustratingly, through this, the developers appear to be more interested in pushing out paid DLC than fixing bugs -- and for the "Different teams!" excuse camp, if you have critical bugs but lots of DLC makers, then it's time to allocate your hiring resources differently.  They also rely heavily on streamers to promote the game and shower their favorite people with gifts to get good press rather than taking care of their product as recent reviews show.  Famously, one developer recently said on Twitter that exploiting streamers would not be punished because they rely on them for promotion.  When they do try to fix balance issues, they frequently overshoot. There's more survivors than killers so "fixes" tend to be heavy nerfs to killer perks or buffs to survivor abilities in order to quiet the loudest voices.

The game does have promise and is initially rewarding before all the other issues wear away at it.  If you can play with friends, it helps a lot just because most things are more fun with friends.  But I couldn't, in good conscience, tell anyone to spend $15-$20 on the game (plus another $20 in DLC) in its current state. Right now, I'm not sure if it'll ever get there.
Updated for the 2.0 release.

Dead by Daylight (DBD) is a hard game to rate, though it can probably be best described as a very good idea with a whole ton of messy execution. The TL;DR is that it's addictively good fun, particularly with friends, but it has some deep-seated flaws that haven't been fixed since launch and are unlikely to be at any point in the future. If you don't want to put up with those then definitely give this a pass.

For your first few hours of play, DBD'll sweep you up in the fantasy of sneaking around smoke-filled woods with a monstrous murderer hunting you. You'll nervously pan the camera around looking for the Killer as you anxiously try not to miss skill check minigames on the generators you're trying to power to win. Or alternatively, you're the Killer and you catch the sweet, sweet sight of a red jacket poking out from round a rock and you know the chase is on. This fantasy stage of the game is really good fun. When you get completely new players as both sides then it's a hilarious running and screaming fest in which everyone'll come out intoxicated with the game and wanting more.

What's frustrating is that same immersion is ruined as soon as you start to play the game a lot. When you play Killer against Survivors that know every trick in the book (many of which utterly shatter any sense of theme or immersion the game brings, such as fearlessly running up to you while you're carrying a Survivor to a sacrificial hook so that they can body block your ability to actually use the hook) then the game collapses into a frustrating mess where you feel powerless watching a player lead you around and around the same stack of obstacles and JUST as you get close then they drop a stun pallet on you and, if you're lucky, they leave you alone, but if you're not then they'll taunt you to follow them some more around another set of obstacles. You're meant to be a creature of nightmares that's terrifying and semi all-powerful, but instead you're just left running helplessly after a taunting person like some ridiculous slapstick comedy character. Oh, and you've got to stick out a whole match of this nonsense if you want to earn your upgrade points.

The 2.0 update has curtailed some of the elements of the game that enabled this play style as aggressively, but my biggest problem - and I appreciate that this may be a personal taste thing - is that the nonsense of chases around objects even exists at all. It's a clear design choice made by the developers to make it integral to surviving, but I feel the implementation of that idea feels cheap and cheesy; you mileage may vary I guess. However, now that this design element is in the game, it cannot be removed as it's so engrained into the design at this point. Survivors need a way of keeping the Killer busy during the match while their teammates do work, but the stealth elements just aren't quite good enough to achieve this. The baseline design just isn't fit-for-purpose enough for competitive gameplay that maintains the game's theme in this sense.

Even if you accept that the running around silliness is a part of the game, they've been balance tweaking how it works for TWO YEARS now. Like, how does it take you TWO YEARS of play data to determine the necessary changes to fix this aspect of the game? This aspect that's been in the game since day one?

Moving on to other areas of the baseline elements of the game that aren't up to muster, the game's absolutely riddled with issues that can't even be described as "good game design." For example, a current play issue is that it's too easy/quick for Survivors to complete their generator objective these days. In design terms, you have to fix this by creating BASELINE modifications such as making the generator repair times take longer, however, instead of that solution, the developers added a perk that does EXACTLY that fix (Hex: Ruin - basically makes generator completion slower). So now every competitive Killer has to waste one perk slot on a perk that actually gives them a chance of achieving something before they get rushed out of the game. That slot could be used to make a more interesting strategic choice, but no, you need Hex: Ruin. You can win without it, sure, but it's very hard to do so at the high ranks. And that's part of the problem. Baseline changes made to balance the high level (like lengthening generator repair times) would screw the low level players so badly they would win games a lot less and would probably quit the game. The skill disparity between the high and low ranks makes balancing too difficult to make baseline changes, which means the devs are stuck using perks to bail them out of the game's baseline design flaws.

On the topic of perks, from a balance perspective I would say that they swing from "completely destroys all hope the Killer has of killing you" or "critical for Killer success" to "does something, sometimes, based on a percentage chance, when a specific trigger fires, and the effect is basically nothing to write home about." Guess what? You NEED the good ones to be competitive, but they're unlocked entirely at random so prepare to grind levels until the RNG gives you what you want.

Particularly frustrating with the perk system is how the most popular Survivor perks are the ones that basically bail the Survivor out for being fundamentally bad at the game premise itself. Get caught by the Killer? Receive a skill check test that lets you instantly wriggle out of their grasp. Take a hit in a chase you ultimately escape? Most Survivors need to have a medkit item or another player to heal them, but you can just heal yourself up at a reduced speed for free! Oh and you can use it an infinite number of times in the match! This is straight up, 100% bad design. The Killer has achieved their objective and the Survivor has explicitly failed theirs (by getting caught/hit, etc.) and yet they are bailed out by "crutch" perks, which, by the way, the Killer has none-to-low access to counterplay. These crutches would be fine if that's what they were used as, but instead they're just used as a way of letting Survivors make maximum risk-reward plays with a total safety net to catch them if they fail. Furthermore, when you play against entire teams using these perks then it just feels monstrously unfair to Killers, at least at the lower levels, but there're plenty of complaints at the high end too. Incidentally, Killer crutch perks (such as Hex: Ruin) have a level of counterplay or restriction open to them that almost none of the Survivor crutches have without the Killer wasting perk slots on the specific counterplay perks. For example, to counter self-healing Survivors, Killers can use the perk A Nurse's Calling, but to counter Hex: Ruin then Survivors need no perk, they just have to find a totem statue in the map during the game (can be trivial to find and does waste Survivor time, but at least they're not using up a perk slot to counter it). The devs think this creates a competitive meta of perk selection, but it's really just baseline game flaws being poorly covered instead of actually fixed at the source.

However, despite all I've said... The crazy thing about Dead by Daylight is... I keep playing? Like I said at the beginning, the game idea is amazing, and even though the execution's unbelievably bad, it's still bizarrely addictive to play. Stressful, frustrating and I haven't even mentioned the DISGUSTING level of community toxicity that the developers still haven't addressed after two years, yet I'm still kept into this game for some insane reason.

For the record, I have no issue with the DLC store they have introduced recently.

So, I'm saying don't get it because it's got deep-seated flaws that aren't ever going to be fixed, but it can also be fantastic fun often enough if you don't mind putting up with some of the most ridiculous game design execution ever.
Sadly this toxic-community and their "us vs them" mentality is slowly killing this game. 


Survivors:

On one hand you have the bully 4 man survivor squads that use discord to reveal all your perks, your location etc. The type of players that need every second chance perk that exists + their 3 friends equipped with flashlights to even survive a rank 20 match. 

A lot of these players have only one goal in mind: to "bully" you with their friends. May it be teabagging after every pallet they throw at you, make clicking noises with their flashlight behind you, or just try to waste your time by doing nothing but just hiding even when the exit gates are open. They do it just in hopes of frustrating you.

Don't even get me started on how those players behave in the aftergame chat. There is no logic with most of them. You are still on the map if one of them got hooked = camper. One of them ran into you while he was still being hurt = tunneler. You have BBQ&Chili = hacker. You killed all 4 survivors = tryhard. You killed 3 and one escaped through the hatch = ez. The insults range from calling you a "baby killer" to stuff you read in other games like LoL, Dota or Overwatch.

Having those people as your team mates is also not very pleasant. Prepare to get farmed off the hook/be used as bait for the killer.


Killers:

On the other hand you have the camping and tunneling killers that are going to defend their actions by telling you their heartbreaking stories about how often they get bullied by those 4 man groups I was just talking about before.

It doesn't matter if you play in a team or solo, because often you get camped for apparently being "in a SWF group", even though you were just playing by yourself. 

A lot of stuff in this game can make you seem "toxic"  like certain perks, items and playstyles which would be too much to list, but those make it right to camp and tunnel you so the match is over for you in 2 minutes, but hey: "just do gens" lol. Heck, I even saw posts on how the new "Calm Spirit" is a crutch perk and you deserve to get tunneled for it...

A lot of killers will never accept that they are just as toxic as their counterpart in this game, while the survivor side pride themselves with being toxic.

Also there are few lagswitchers in this game. Since the killer is hosting the match (game is P2P and doesn't use dedicated servers) he can just freeze you on the spot and put you down by making his connection lag on purpose. Sometimes it's just very subtle and other times plain obvious, the obvious ones are that you can't move your character during chases for a longer duration until the killer has attacked you twice, but if the killer is not in a chase the connection is fine, or you are hiding far away from the killer and suddenly he hits you without standing beside you.

Sadly I never heard of a lagswitcher getting banned from this game and one of them even won the first official tournament in this game a couple of months ago ($5000 tournament), even though the finale was live streamed and you had the footage right there infront of you. 

Since that finale there are more lagswitchers than ever because they know nothing will happen to them.


Summary:

You can't have a constructive discussion with any of them, because most people will defend their survivor/killer side to the death and are going to complain and complain about buffs and nerfs until the devs gives the side that screamed louder all that they want, which leads to major imbalance on the other side for a few months until they get what they want and then we start again...

Maybe it's not the best idea to take advice from Reddit posts on how to balance this game.
The only game where you are punished badly for playing one side, the killer side. I play both sides equally, but nowadays, you have to be a masochist to actually enjoy playing killer. The game is having SEVERE balance issues at the moment and only 3 killers out of all of them is actually ''viable''. I use quotes because that's not totally true, it's still up to the survivors to mess up no matter how good you are. Devs are pushing patches with ''fixes'' , but then it only last 1 week then it's shadow patched back in. 

Playing survivor is too easy, I can loop killers for a while without getting downed. It shouldn't be a thing.  I shouldn't be able to survive the whole game by having the killer on me in a 1v4 game. The 1 should always be stronger, but it's not the case. The game is built with a 1v1v1v1v1 in mind. And that's wrong on so many levels.

I used to love this game, I really did. I think you can tell by the amount of hours I poured into this. But the lack of proper balancing in the latest months... I just can't recommend this game. I can't.
I have over 500 hours in this game, so obviously I enjoyed it at one point. This used to be my favorite game and I would play it for several hours every day. But now it's a honestly such a terrible game and is only getting worse, and let me tell you why.
The game is centered around the idea of a killer and 4 survivors with the killer in the dominant role. There are various killers to choose from that all have cool unique abilities, but the problem is that the killer is no longer the dominant role, making the survivors both the group AND the dominant role. It started out correctly, it was buggy but it was done right with the killers actually being scary. As of now there have been so many survivor buffs and killer nerfs that playing killer is a joke and isn't fun anymore. Being a killer main I have personally experienced this gradual degression into nothingness that the developers of the game have enforced.
The other main problem is that the developers are the most disconnected people that I have ever seen, completely ingoring the blatently obvious problems that there game has. They focus gameplay around lower level survivors which means more experienced players are almost impossible to kill. The killer nerfs have gotten so bad that even the survivor side of the community is complaining, and that's saying something. Usually the survivors are pretty toxic, so for them to recognize a problem on the killer end of things should have been a wake up call to the developers, but to no avail.
To end this I would like to quote one of the developers who was asked the question "Do you have any ideas on how you are going to impove the killer experience?"  This was responded to with "Maybe try survivor for a bit, or play something else for like a week. Try civilization or something." This was literally a developer saying that they aren't going to fix the obvious balance issues that there game has. I hope that in the future this game will be fixed and will once again be a magnificent and unique horror game, but for now please avoid it for your own sake.
I like this game, I really do but the fact that there is a bug in the game that completely wipes all progress is unforgivable, 70 hours of progress was completley lost during an update today, is the game good? Yes. are the Devs good people for pumping out DLC instead of fixing these issues? No
When the developers began talking about adding the microtransaction store, they promised to give rewards for those who already purchased chapters(DLC) characters. Even if the rewards were planned on being just cosmetic, the developers seem to have "forgotten" to add this in with the public test build being pushed to stable. I feel as if the devs should have just given us an equal dollar value to the DLC's we've purchased in the form of cells. This way anyone who has purchased the dlc in the past could be given the cosmetics they were promised.
This game is great. It really is a lot of fun. The toxicity among the survivor community is un fÜcking real though. You get a kill and you see scratch marks everywhere? YOU HAVE TO WALK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP OR THAT'S CAMPING. You have 3 generators left and are catching people and killing who does them? GEN PATROLLING NOOB. You run a perk they don't like "LOL YOU HAVE TO USE A CRUTCH TO WIN AHHAHA SO BAD KILLER." When they have dstrike, sprint burst, self care, borrowed time. 4 absolute crutch perks that you will see non stop in higher ranks. Play a killer they don't like? Dc and you get a depip because your game had you carrying them for 20 seconds and glitched out whenever you put them on a hook. You kill someone who is in a SWF? You're scum of the earth. You do anything in this game, that isn't letting the survivors camp you for bloodpoints. You. Are. Scum. This seriously needs to change, I will probably still play the game now and then, but this is just going to be a game that has died and it's going to become an evolve clone at this rate if they keep listening to stupid survivors who are just toxic for the sake of it.
I've played since the Beta and had a lot of fun with it. It's amazing value for money and has almost limitless replayability. The game was incredibly buggy and still stuffers from issues today, although the devs keep dropping patches, fixes and small gameplay tweaks to help improve things and its come a long way with many positive improvements.

Sadly I have to say that the game seems to have drifted into a very bad place and needs to serious work to put it back on track. Ultimately the premise of the game is based around hide and seek, where the seeker is a killer hunting for his/her prey (the survivors). These survivors are in constant fear for their lives and must try to repair generators as quickly as they can in order to power the exit gates so they can flee the killer and reach safety. This is the problem.. the contant fear just isn't there any longer, survivors simply taunt and run rings around killers often armed with a vast array of tools and perks readily at their disposal addiitonally teams of friends can communicate over voice chat giving a monoumenal tactical advantage against the killer.

Major work is needed on the game in order to bring about some balance, at the moment killers are often too powerful against newer or less skilled players. Whilst at the same time survivors become far too powerful in the late game, changes need to be included that keep the same level of fear new players experience and make escaping the killer actually challenging at all skill levels. This keep things fun for everyone its more rewarding to know you escaped when the odds were stacked against you and keeps killers engaged in the game.

Moving on to DLC

I've purchased all DLC so far and been quite happy with the chapters some good some average until the most recent one - Freddy krueger aka 'The Nightmare'. There was a lot of excitement around this new licenced killer and when it was released I found it to have quite a learning curve although it was very easy to track and down a single survivor it was quite tricky to manage all 4 of them and resulted in a LOT of running about in chases. Ultimatley I found him a little weak but with the right perks and techniques I could see him being a fun killer. Just ONE WEEK after release a tsunami of hatred fell upon Freddy from the survivor community calling for nerfs and complaint about him being too strong many of them being very new to the game as I mentioned earlier inexperienced players will struggle early on and shouldnt be a judge of game balance from one side.
       The NERF hit a few weeks after release, with freddy suffering badly in all areas. Whilst the devs didn't go ahead with 100% of their initial planned nerfs the ones that they brough in were completely uneccessary and went too far destroying a paid DLC killer based on the loudest cries from the community. Freddy now stands a shadow of his former self and has become the weakest killer in the game; which is a shame as im sure he was play tested and balanced internally before all of that was just thrown away.

Behavior Digital have seen the last of my money and I will no longer purchase any future DLC, I'll continue to enjoy the game playing as surivor and killer but have been burned by this recent decisions and will stick to consuming the free content thats offered with the hope that they learn lessons and attempt to put the game back on course to where it should be.

In summary:

Pros

- Game is amazing value for money (especially in the sales)
- Procedurally generated maps make for high replayability
- Active development, new patches and changes
- Open and engaging with community on development
- New free content included not just paid DLC
- Very active player base

Cons

- Still major bugs in game even so long after release (including save game loses)
- High levels of toxicity  (im looking at you post game chat)
- Game promotes bad play styles (infinite pallet looping, hook camping)
- Poor balance between killer and survivor (playing killer as killer at rank 1 is not fun and SWF can be a joke)
- A round can be ruined for others when a player purposefully disconnects (which happens far too often)


I reach rank 1 killer and rank 1 survivor after each reset and have played serveral hundred hours as both sides, hopefully that gives me a little weight behind my experiences so far in reviewing this.
I've spent about 300 hours on ps4 and roughly half of that on steam.  Typically each season I have been high tier survivor and mid to high killer.  I can't recomend this game to anyone.  There's obviously a love hate to the game but this final straw is this emblem system.  The community is unbearably toxic, the devs consistantly take the game in the wrong direction, people ruin your game, be it selfish/clueless teammates or cheap killers.  Watching the dev stream shows how out of touch they are, as there are serious issues with mechanics and balance and they ignore them constantly.  Insidous killers hiding in the basement, face camping and OP killers ruin it for survivors.  Trolling survivors who run 1 perk because they think they're great and consistant pallet looping and purple flashlights ruin it for average killers.  Honestly this game was much better shortly after launch than it is now.  High tier players are intentionally de ranking just to find games because it's impossible for casual players to rank up now.  These devs are clueless and the community just adds insult to injury.  The frustration just isn't worth the time.  Que the "Thinks this is funny" nerds

EDIT: They've updated the emblem system, much more balanced and easier to rank up.

EDIT 2: it's 2k19 and this game somehow got worse.  The new killer is actually broken. The perk reworking has made the game less enjoyable for both survivor and killer. The community is just as brain dead as ever.  I just had a game with a teammate from Germany and also one from Mexico in the same lobby.  Doing a pretty good job so far I'd say.
First off, this review doesn't have much to do about the game itself, just how bad the DBD Mods and Devs treat people.

My friend got permabanned without any warning, and without doing anything to earn said-ban. Before y'all go off "nobody gets banned for nothing", you've never clearly dealt with DBD or its mods/devs. My friend has been playing EDIT: "2 years 2 months, 2 weeks, 4 days (Not including the Alpha/Beta)", 2k hours, and has never cheated. The only thing he's guilty of is crappy internet once in awhile. He was banned for: "we have some obscure evidence we can't disclose to you that you were changing your save file", so 1) the mods can only see the current save file and not any old ones and 2) they don't have any proof (cause it didn't happen) so they WON'T show their evidence. Someone supposidly reported him for doing this, (assuming its someone with friends cause he never changed his save file) and it's pretty ridiculous.

He's not the only victim, there are plently of other people who have been permabanned for "altering their save file/achievements" when they did nothing of the sort. This game has so many bugs in it, playing it so long, I remember each time they had problems; with the achievements bugging out for everyone, with save files being corrupt, these things causing everyone to lose their progress in this game.

Oh yeah, not to mention there are very popular streamers out there, (can't say or I'll be name shaming) who consistently DC from games, even have Nurse=disconnect as their names, but because they have loads of viewers and they are "advertising" the game, they are pretty exempt from any sort of bans. Seems fair, right?

And anyone who DARE to post a thread ANYWHERE about how unfair they've been treated, get a generid mod response: "we'll look into this" and "our team looked over every detail carefully" and the "ban is valid". THESE MODS are VOLUNTEERS! They DON'T GET PAID!!!! So NO one is ever going to get unbanned since these Mods are clearly Power Tripping. I'm ready for my DBD ban, forum ban, and for this review to be deleted, all because I dare to speak up against these mods. Hit me with your best shot ;)

TLDR; You'll put a lot of hours into this game, salty/toxic people will report you, VOLUNTEER mods on Power trips will ban you without having or showing evidence, you'll get banned from Forums for speaking out; and you'll be so tilted and salty since even though this game can be fun, there's so many bugs and no dedicated servers, so save your time and energy and just stay away.
1000+ hours in and I can't recommend this game (at least for killers) anymore. It started fun, but the constant nerfing of killers and buffing of survivors has just led to an INCREDIBLY toxic environment of 4 on 1 bully sessions where the killer is the most helpless on the map. If any reason exists to fear a killer the devs nerf it on the double (what did Freddy take a WEEK?) Sure, anyone can kill newbs, but this game attracts so few new players due to the community's (quite infamous) toxicity. There is also a complete lack of a way to practice the game without dealing with people who have hundreds of hours more than you bullying you regardless of role. To make matters worse there is a rank reset every month so that Tier one players end up playing against newbies every month (this is especially true in a survive with friends game). This is a very effective way to abort a new and growing player base. There is also no way to set up killer preferences to avoid SWF so ANY new killers are usually doomed to frustration instead of enjoyment.  Add in the survivor groups that use some voice chat and even experienced killers get pushed around like chumps. Don't take my word for it...look online and see for yourself. It seriously is a shame because at its core this is a really fun game. Far too many nerfs, technical isues, and more than anything toxic play to enjoy anymore. Take a pass on this game. if you want a murder sim there are better ones out there, with killers who have a reason to be feared and even ones that allow you to avoid toxic teams if you like.
To start with, I absolutely loved the game, up until it completely wiped 85 hours of gameplay from my account for absolutely no reason.

That said, this was 85 hours, which included the triple bloodpoint bonus event, so in total, the amount of bloodpoints that I invested into my killers is more around the lines of 120+ hours

After having all of my progress wiped, and all my killers reverted back to level 1, and losing all prestige, I proceeded to brows the forums for my next step in order to have them restore the progress that I had worked for - Sadly the only thing I was able to find was a thread stating that I needed to e-mail all of my revelant account info to their support address, and present screen shots as proof, and they would get back to me.

It has been just shy of a month since I sent them the first e-mail, having sent the same mail every single day for the past three weeks, and I have yet to receive so much as an aknowledgement receipt that they received my mail, and would restore my progress in due time, but instead I have not heard a word from this developer, and with very limited methods of contact with them, I fear that all of the time that I have invested in this game, that I so enjoyed, has sadly gone to waste, and will not be restored, since their support team cannot care less about their fan base losing over a hundred hours of progress, and the fact that saved data isn't even backed up to their servers in this day and age is absolutely ridiculous given the digital age that we are in, yet apparently the only copy of your saved data is on your local machine, and should that get "accidently overwriten" by the game, your progress is lost, and you are forced to send mail after mail after mail in hopes that one day, this developer will respond and restore what you worked endless hours for.

Based on this experience alone, in a game that promotes progress so much, that it's the pure driving force behind advancing your characters, yet your progress can be lost in the blink of an eye due to bad programming, and no digital backups of your save data - I would not reccomend this game to anyone if you have any hopes about progression in the long run, since hundreds of hours of progress can dissapear just like that, and getting it back is a lost cause.

*Edit - After waiting roughly six weeks, I was finally re-imbursed for the blood points that I lost, however I would have liked to see further compensation for the lengthy wait. Hopefully the developer will fix this issue somewhere down the line, so that we do not have to revert to 1995 methods of manually backing up saved games."
The game is very well made, and it's a nice and unique concept, I really love it but I need to give it a thumbs down as for now because of how much time it takes to play as a killer.

You need to create a lobby wait for people to join and apparently there is a bug where your lobby disappears from the system or something like this and you just keep waiting and pepole don't come, I've been waiting 10 mins, 20 mins and people come and go but I still cannot manage to get a full lobby of 4 people, and it amazes me because there are like 8k people online playing and it's impossible that atleast 4 people don't get in your lobby

If you really want to play as a survivor then you can buy it, you join lobbies pretty fast, but as a killer it's another story

They might fix this issue in the future but for now it's a thumbs down from me
Sadly this toxic-community and their "us vs them" mentality is slowly killing this game.

I want to love this game. I really do. On the outside this game is a fantastic experience from both sides of a pyschotic rampage. However when you want to get deeper into this game you'll find playing the killer is nothing but a frustrating run around watching as survivors endlessly ledge/window hop and self heal their way to victory. 

There is no match making system and for someone who mainly plays the killer, having little to no perks versing a groups of higher levels is just down right depressing. If you ever manage to luck your way into snagging one of these high ranking pricks you'll more often than not see them disconnect before you get a chance to sacrifice them, so they can preserve their rank, and screw you over by depriving you of points that you worked so hard for. 

Playing as the survivor is probably the best and most fun/atmospheric experience you'll get from this. However I can't recommend this to anyone until they sort out the fairplay in this game. No matter how much I want to, It's just too infuriating...
A decent party game, marred by a toxic community and incompetent developers.

Dead by daylight was designed at its core to be a fun party game. It was intended to have 4 killers and that be the end of it. Since then, the development team have tried to create a kind of competitive game around core mechanics that simply do not support it.

You can play as either a team of 4 survivors who attempt to fix generators and escape, or as a killer who attempts to stop them. When the game first came out, you could only queue as a survivor solo. It was the developer’s intention to make you feel isolated and alone and to further facilitate choosing between risking your life to save your fellow survivors, or to look out for number one. Several ‘aura reading’ perks were introduced that allowed you to use up one of your four precious perk slots to gain more information about your teammates and their whereabouts.

This was changed just shortly after the games release, allowing players to queue up with their friends known as survive with friends (SWF). Whilst certainly a fun and needed change, several aspects of the game have never recovered. The developers were left trying to balance the game around both solo and group players which resulted in either SWF being too strong or solo survivors being too weak (or both at the same time). Playing with friends gives an incredible advantage, knowing where the killer is, when to fix generators and make saves. Good 4-man SWF became infamous for their ability to be able to bully a killer and win consistently every single time (Just google the depip squad). Aura reading perks became redundant. Solo survivors got shafted and Killers were forced to deal with omnipotent survivors. 

Now as the killer, you usually have to hit a survivor twice until they are put in the dying state. You can either let them bleed out on the floor (a process which lasts 4 minutes and they are free to crawl around and get healed by teammates), or place them on a hook. Here they last 60 seconds on stage 1 where they can attempt to wiggle out, 60 seconds at stage 2 where they have to struggle to stay alive, and finally stage 3 where they die. If they get hooked after already being hooked once, they will go to the next stage, meaning at maximum 3 hooks will lead to a sacrifice.

Already I’m certain you’re seeing a fatal flaw with this game design. Very early on killers found that after hooking a survivor, waiting around to try and kill other survivors (a valid tactic against overly altruistic survivors) or in other cases literally just face camping (also a valid tactic but seen as incredibly bad mannered) could net them more kills. If you take a survivor out of the game early, that’s one less person working on generators, which gives the killer more time to patrol and complete his or her objectives.

For a solo survivor, this can lead to a great deal of frustration when you are the first to go down and get killed right off the bat. Personally, I’ve always felt this was my fault playing survivor. I did not play stealthily enough to avoid the killer nor did I run to pallets and windows fast enough to avoid being downed. However, there is a pretty significant part of the community that feels, for lack of a better word, ‘entitled’ to get unhooked and have to be hooked 3 times until they are killed. Otherwise the killer is not playing ‘fair’. It’s this that I believe leads to a great deal of the toxicity found in the game. At its core, the game has mechanics that can leave players feeling ‘cheated’ out of a proper experience. 

Many players believe that the game is unbalanced, and a sort of ‘unwritten code’ was developed by survivors that they try to enforce on killers. Camping, face camping, Tunnelling, slugging and even taking a select few perks is frowned upon. The problem is, when you take away these strategies, all you are left with is a player who is forced to play like an NPC for the amusement of 4 random players. The game itself is not very mechanically intensive. Unless you are playing the nurse, or to a lesser extent, Hillbilly or hag, your ability to hurt the survivors is dependant on the survivors making mistakes, not you making a play. The best you can hope for is mind games around looping spots. The game is about decision making more so than mechanical play and taking away the decisions a killer can make leaves you with very few options to play. 

As a killer, most games will usually go one of two ways. You can either follow this unwritten code and more times than not, survivors will teabag, taunt you and call you a baby killer at the end. Alternatively, you can show no mercy, play to the best of your ability (with the limited skill ceiling), get multiple kills, only to be flamed in the end game chat and even on your steam profile if you have not set it to private. The thing is, there is no incentive to play to these rules. Even if you do your best not to camp or tunnel, players will still accuse you of it anyway. It’s become almost a meme at this point. Just look up the dead by daylight parodies on YouTube.

Dead by daylight is a truly fascinating example of human psychology. In most games, flaming and toxicity is directed at your teammates as they are the ones making you lose. Here it is always directed at the opponent on the opposite team. I have invaded over 1000 people on the Dark Souls games, got on to the leader boards of Total War: Warhammer, and played many other multiplayer games. In all that time I got a single comment on my profile from Dark Souls, someone calling me a sneaky ninja for killing him. We subsequently became friends. In dead by Daylight, at time of writing this review, I have 177 comments on my profile, the majority of which from survivors being angry that I didn’t play a certain way or give them a chance to win. 

What I find strange is that the whole camping issue could have been quite easily fixed, if the developers were willing to throw away the hooks or at the very least, introduce an alternative game mode. One proposition I made was instead of hooks, the killer pushes the survivors down into black ooze controlled by the entity. The survivor will then be teleported to another black ooze puddle somewhere on the map that the killer has no way of knowing. Another survivor is required to rescue them from the black ooze and heal them up. This ooze could work the same way as the hooks presently do. At stage one they can attempt to escape, stage 2 they have to struggle and in stage three, are absorbed by the entity. The numbers could be tweaked as this would completely stop the biggest complaint people have about the game. Sadly, the developer’s solution, instead of fixing the core of the game, was to add new perks in an attempt to apply band aids on glaring problems. 

What this achieved was creating a perk arm race of sorts. At the time of this review, there are 107 perks in the game, yet you will only see the same 15 or so over and over again as these have become both the meta, and super vital. 90% of killers at rank 1 will run Hex: ruin, usually coupled with BBQ and a couple other high tier perks. Survivors will run self-care, an exhaustion perk of some kind and then either Urban evasion, Decisive strike, We’ll make it, Adrenaline, Borrowed time, or We’re gonna live forever. Not only does this stifle variety and creativity, but means that skill is a lot more determined by perk than actual skill. Newer players will struggle against these perks and a great deal of grinding is required to unlock them. 

I had another Page and a half of review, but I’m at my limit and realised it centred more on problems I had with the company. I’ll leave it with this. Dead by Daylight could have been great. I only hope a competitor comes along and creates what Dead by Daylight should have been.

Although I enjoy this game a lot, I can NOT reccomend this to new players for multiple reasons which will be covered in this review, however let me first cover how this game works

As a survivor, you team up with 3 others, either randoms or as a premade team of friends named SWF.
Once in a game (aka match), survivors will have to do five generators (shortened to gens), then open the exit gates to escape and "live" another day in the nightmare of the entity's realm

As a killer, you host a lobby and have 4 survivors join to start a match.
Once in a match, you will have to kill all 4 survivors by crippling them (aka downing) with your weapon, picking them up and putting them on a sacrificial hook.
You must make sure no survivors escape to please your literal god master, the "Entity"

1. TOXCICITY
This fanbase is extremely toxic, securing a kill as a killer, referred to as "camping" and "tunneling" will get some tasty -rep's and comments on your profile, just check out mine.
People are very toxic in endgame chat, especially if you are the killer. 
This is one of the main reasons, that if you aren't thick-skinned, you shouldn't buy this game.

2. KILLER GAMEPLAY
You'd think, that killers would be the powerful and have control in the game but that's far from true. To sum it up, the time it takes to complete a generator is very short when compared to how long a chase takes. Furtherly, it takes very long for many killers to move around the map, meaning that you often come to a generator and it gets finished in front of your face. Many weaker killers do not have enough time to catch and kill survivors.

This all combined makes playing any killer except the "Hillbilly", "Nurse" and "Hag" (the three best killers in the game) a chore, and even as the two best killers, you need to spend hundreds of hours mastering them unless you want to be "bullied" by the survivors. 

The worst thing here is the "SWF" I mentioned before, combining the amount of time pallets can waste, along with perfectly communicating where you are, what perks you are using and what killer you are, it's very painful.


3. SURVIVOR GAMEPLAY
Playing survivor however, without SWF or the "Perks" I mentioned earlier (perks are things you can equip on your character which give you special abilities like 150% faster movement speed for 3 seconds) playing survivor is a chore too, since the killer has perks which makes finding you easier, and since stealth is very hard to pull of because of how maps are designed, you have to "pallet loop" (going pallet to pallet to waste as much time as possible) while your teammates (hopefully) do gens. If you're not being chased, you have to hold down M1 for 80 seconds to complete a generator (boring). 

If the killer doesn't give up on you, downs you and the exit gates are open, then you're basically dead unless you're teammates decide to come for you and have the perk "Borrowed Time".

Until you "level up" all your survivors to get the perks, or play with SWF and communication devices like Discord, the game will not be the most fun. 
(Edit: you now start with your characters perks and finishing the tutorial gives you enough bloodpoints to level up a bit)

Furtherly your teammates will often have 3 braincells, unhooking you infront of the killer (reffered to as farming), is quite common. If your teammates can't loop, you might have to take the agression yourself so you don't have a 1v1 on your hands, or do two gens and hope for hatch-game.


5. THE DEVS
It feels like they don't listen. They just nerfed a balanced perk named "BBQ and Chilli", which was often used on killers. This perk incentivized leaving the hook after you hook a survivor, meaning that less people camped so that the game was more fun on both side. It feels like they don't play their own game, as they've released multiple trash killers (Clown, Legion), along with their perks being horrible. 

6. THE LEGION
Wowie, a new killer, the Legion. Guess what? He's trash. He has a lower base movement speed and his ability forces him to hit a survivor 4 times to down them. He has nearly no chase, even Clown without addons would be better than him. His design is generic, his special perks are trash. It feels like he was extremely rush. And instead of buffing him by making a currently meta (very good) perk work better on him, they opted to nerf another weak killer (Doctor) instead by making said meta perk no longer work on him.

7. THE HATCH
I've forgotten to include this in my original review, but I might as well add it now. After two gens have been done and three survivors have been killed, the hatch will spawn and open. A survivor can jump into the hatch to escape, but while jumping he or she can be grabbed and put onto the killer's shoulder.
If both sides come to the hatch at the same time or the killer finds it first, the killer and survivor will be forced to stare at eachother if they want to win, as acting (hitting the survivor or jumping in) will result in the loss for the side acting. This can lead to "hatch stand-offs" lasting between 5 minutes to an hour, it's boring and has been a problem since the game started and it still hasn't been fixed.



8. TO SUM IT UP
This game CAN be very fun if you are playing with friends, especially in "KYF" (Kill your Friends).
However, playing killer without the strongest perks and the best killers is a chore and really unfun, unless you're playing with brain-dead survivors.
Playing survivor without the strongest perks is okay-ish, but nothing special due to the ease in survival.

Don't buy it for now, but keep a close eye for the next few updates.
(I said this like 6 months ago lmao^)

Edit 8: finally updated the review again, removed and added a few points, revised others.
This game is a good concept... but one of the worst implementations I have ever seen (except for those low price indies you find sometimes on steam):

First of all it is based on a P2P system that, as many people know, has a lot of flaws for a PVP (wannabe) competitive game.

Second this game (being asymetrical 4 survivors vs 1 killer) is heavily survivor biased. You wouldn't expect on an horror game where 4 survivors have to face a brutal killer... filled with dark energy gifted from an ancient being that literally feeds on hope... the killer to be bullyed and trolled by the survivors who have easy life against said killer.

When I say that the game is heavily survivor biased... I mean the devs (or whoever takes decisions inside BHVR). The bias is so evident that they couldn't even wait one week to announce that they were going to nerf Freddy Kruger who was already a very weak killer (probably the weakest or second weakest killer) for rank 1.

BHVR comunity manager (Not_Queen) has also stated that they "balance the game around the majority of the players". So bad that the majority of the players are survivors on low ranks making the game completly unbalanced for rank 1 killers who have to face the biggest challenge this game has to offer... and one of the most frustrating experiences I have seen in my 20 year old videogames experience.

Another very big issue this game has not solved is the survive with friends feature.
This feature completly ruins the balance of the game as survivors (who normally should use perks to gain information like Empathy/kindred etc) can gain information for free using voice comunication softwares like discord or teamspeak, making the game even harder for the killer.

In conclusion my advise is:

If you are more interested in playing survivor... don't buy this game, as it will become boring after 50 hours of M1 simulator like 3/4 of the survivor games are.

If you are more interested in playing killer... absolutly don't buy this game... unless you are a very patient guy.
Honestly? i loved playing this game and enjoyed it for so long, have over 1k hours and have countless good memories from playing survive with friends. But....sadly its lost that fun element to it due to the developers not really caring about fixing the problems in this game. They're too focused on earning money and bringing out new killers and cosmetics without trying to fix the bugs that are causing problems for survivors and killers all the time. Whether its the dodgy hit boxes that sometimes feel like they're the size of the map or there are people who take advantage of exploits like the r exploit where you spam r to drop a survivor when someone tries to blind to you to avoid getting the save. The new medium vaults have their own problems where the killer should obviously get the hit but dont due to this new vaulting system. If you asked me now if i would suggest buying this game, i would say a solid no, the game is too buggy to be fun and most people are either really sweaty/toxic or super immersed. Its just not enjoyable and i would suggest you save your money and buy another type of game cause this one isnt getting fixed anytime soon.
Hi :) 
This Developer's are...subhuman acting retards who banned like 1000 Players like me but never told them why. 
Let's be real, it's an online Horror Game and they add a report funktion and an allchat where the killed survivors can talk toxic bullshit 2 you after you killed them on hook..I loved that game like 800h, than they destroyed all of it and i started to troll myself to r1/r1 but hey they give a shit, they sjust want money. the new kontent was allways shit and to hard survivor based, that u can TOY with the killer if u are good enough survivor, like whole game, stun him, teabag the killer and run again. the dev's never listened to the community and just banned bugabuser and killercosplaying (since when a HillBilly or a MM would be friendly or something?!?!) dudes like me..but the ban's and the bullshit balancing aren't everything, they also never attached a real ranking system and i had much friends who lost her legacy stuff and prestige's and lvl's and all they got was BloodPoints but never the REAL stuff you lost back! so whatever u gain, they arent able or willing to give u your own stuff back.

So fuck you dev's for not even sending an email with reasons so I or others could improve or even say sorry or something, u play god's? i hope god give u cancer u fucking retards! kys subhuman's
I've finally deleted this game. I loved it at launch, and it was buggy but I figured that it would get fixed later on. Well.... It hasn't. It's only gotten worse. Queue times are still insane, and most of the time you are just stuck at a load screen then kicked back to the main menu. Also the community is toxic as hell. This game had promise, but dang... Sort out your priorities! Maybe instead of paid DLC, you should fix the base game.
Ignore anyone's review with anything less than 500 hours, they most likely don't know how to play survivor or killer correctly. This game has an extremely high skill cap, and not being skilled at it will yield an annoying experience as you'll go down a lot as survivor, or not get kills often as killer. With that said, here it goes.

First I've met one of my best friends through this game as well as countless other good friends I still talk to and I wouldn't trade that for anything. This game has yielded great experiences, from when I first played survivor, crouching around the map, to recent days of running from and messing with the killer. I should say I play killer/survivor with a 50/50 split, I've achieved rank 1  with killer and survivor multiple times, but you're most memorable times will probably come from playing survivor. Anyways this game has been a blast, a truly fun experience learning how to run from the killer, or learning how to mind-game survivors AS the killer. With a decent Twitch community behind it, there's always something new to watch or learn about the game. But I can't in good faith recommend this game and it really hurts to say that.

The main problem with this game is you aren't rewarded for ranking up, there are no rewards for your work, you're actually penalized. As you rank up this game becomes much more toxic. Survivors and killers both because of their high rank will feel entitled to the win. Survivors will t-bag and troll you, and make sure you know in post-game chat their opinion of whether you should be toaster-bathing yourself or not. And if you become a good survivor, it makes a lot of killers mad. "Oh you ran me for 3 gens, that's an automatic facecamp" (facecamp is when the killer hooks the survivor and doesn't leave them to make SURE they die) and yes that's an actual quote said to me. Which makes you de-pip (partial de-rank). Which is another thing, the ranks.

Every game is ranked whether you like it or not and if ranking up is your main goal prepare to be disappointed. If the killer disconnects you de-pip. Load in the game and one of the survivors didn't load in and its a 1v3? Probably a de-pip. Made the killer mad somehow and now he's facecamping you? De-pip. Double-pip is extremely hard nowadays. You have to do pretty much everything to do so, so most games will be just a normal pip. But that game where you pipped that took 20 minutes, well next game you got found first and hooked and as soon as you were unhooked the killer tunnels you immediately and downs and hooks you again, so back down your rank goes. Rinse and repeat. I guess what i'm trying to say each game is a coin flip of it'll be a toxic waste of time, or an actual enjoyable game.

The MAIN problem in this game is one you won't face unless you get to rank 1, which is that at the core of the game survivors control the game and are much stronger than the killer. The time it takes to down one good survivor, 3 or 4 gens will be done, and extend that time depending on if they have decisive strike or not, which essentially is a get out of jail free card. But like i said, that's only with good, optimal-playing survivors. So now that I've talked about the game play let's talk about the stability of the game, and it's developers.

Bad. Real bad. Constant survivor DC's when game starts, loading screens getting stuck, you name it. And every time the game fails to load you lose your offering. That's right. Even if you don't actually load in the game, your offering still gets used up. Sucks for you I guess! Also I don't exaggerate when I say with every patch or DLC release a slew of bugs come with it. I don't know whats up with this game's code, but every time they tweak something it opens the flood gates to bugs. The devs hardly seem to listen as well. People have been asking to buff Freddy since he was released, still nothing. People have been complaining about Decisive strike being too strong, nothing. They said those 2 things are both in the works, but does it really take over a year to hear your loyal players out? 

I guess they have their development road map is top dog , and well-thought out criticism can take a back seat. One time when the game's lead designer was asked in a QnA about what to do when killer gets too frustrating because it's so stacked against the killer at times, making it literally impossible to win, he said to go play Civ 5. I'm not kidding. The devs just see us as crying kids, not happy that the game isn't perfect, but we don't want it perfect, we've played the hell out of it, we love it, we want it to be better and it could be. And it's a shame it isn't because I love this game. But it's a buggy, unbalanced, unrewarding grind (which is another topic by itself, i'm talking 300 hours or so to get all the perks on everyone WITHOUT prestiging) and it's just not worth it. I don't regret the time I put into this game, but it's not something I can recommend. I know the market is a bit short of multiplayer horror games, but this is less horror and more a game of toxic, bug-ridden tag. It hurts to say, but don't waste your time.


Honestly, I really enjoy playing this game. But I don't recommend it AT ALL. Not even in the slightest. Especially if you don't have a group of friends to play with, because they're the only reason I stick around for this crap. Bug galore, exploits, glitches, dropped games, killers with crappy connection, killers playing from different regions, KILLERS CAMPING EVERY GAME, survivors infiniting, devs that don't give two shits, devs that even ADMITTED OPENLY that streamers are treated differently vs everyone else. All of that, not to mention the toxic community. DBD has one of THE MOST TOXIC communities I have ever seen. I usually forget to take screenshots but I've gotten comments from killers such as "survivor fags" "I fucking hate survivors" "You know why I camp? Because survivors fucking suck" "Thanks I needed some salt for my chicken" "None of you did anything what the fuck (coming from the guy that had like 6k at the end of a match)" "fucking flashlight assholes" "stop pallet camping" etc etc I could go on for weeks. Don't buy this game. I can't say it enough. Save your money, go get something you can have fun with. This game will only give you every kind of cancer imaginable.

EDIT: Forgot to add according to devs camping is a "legit strategy" so get ready for that if you buy it :) :)
I love this game but here’s my list of complaints:

[b]General and Technical[/b]
[list]
[*]Every match the same perks: No One Escapes Death, Hex: Ruin, BBQ & Chili, Franklin's Demise, Sloppy Butcher, Tanatophobia, Bitter Murmur, Hex: Haunted Ground, We’re Gonna Live Forever, Self-Care, Iron Will, Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike (just nerfed btw, so this one will be gone), Prove Thyself, Leader, Plunderer’s Instinct, Bond, Lightweight, etc. We don’t use these because there’s nothing else... We use these because - bar some mediocre choices - everything else is bad. There are some perks that you never encounter. Do some more balancing, devs. I want to see a serious meta shake-up. It would pump even more life into this game.
[*]An overall subpar matchmaking experience. Sometimes I spend 10 minutes with connecting to lobbies, leaving lobbies and backing out to the menu, rinse and repeat. Why? After joining a lobby I either find out that I got connected to a host where I have an unacceptable high ping (150-300) or the host is fine but 30 seconds later they decide to disconnect because they don’t like the 4 Survivors’ picks or their pings.
[*]Graphics and performance. OK, it’s a 3 year old game, but it's running on Unreal Engine which is a pretty nicely scalable and upgradable engine. The overall performance of this game is just clunky and the textures look washed out on some objects. Some textures look like someone put their fingers into paint and tapped all over the place.
[*]Offering burns when the match begins to load, but it does not start in the end, or ends immediately and puts you back into the menu. Completely broken mechanic. Your offering should be kept if you didn’t get the chance to control your character, simple as that.
[*]Skill Check UI is choppy. Strangely, it starts off being choppy but if you run the game for a prolonged time (1-2 hours) it gets smoother and smoother. It's weird.
[*]Some low detail cosmetics, especially the hairs. Ok this is a weird one. I inspect the cosmetic in the store. It has no issues, it's alright, it looks good. I buy and equip it. I go into a match with it and when I see it up close it looks weird, low detail, different than what is shown in the store.
[*]Killer lobbies sometimes getting stuck and are removed from the search pool when 1 Survivor backs out.
[*]P2P system causing a lot of desyncs with stable connection, even after all the fixes. We’re supposed to get dedicated servers this summer so we’ll see how that turns out.
[*]Players crashing out before the match loads in, match starts with less than 4 Survivors. This messes up the match for everyone. I don't care that we have to repair a reduced amount of generators. A match that is not full should be ended right away with no scoring. Nobody wants to de-PiP/de-rank just because someone crashed or failed to connect.
[/list]
[b]Survivor[/b]
[*]Wiggle does not give score and there is not enough distance between your downed spot and the closest hook to finish the wiggle bar. It causes little to no disturbance. Does not matter how precisely, how fast, how consistent you are, if you don't have Decisive Strike, Boil Over or a couple of Survivors delaying the Killer, then it won't do anything. The reason to do it is to prevent the Killer from carrying you all the way to the basement. It's a very badly designed keyboard mashing feature which isn't there to help you, but to annoy you. More annoyance to the Survivor than to the Killer tbh.
[*]Getting hit when already vaulted over: especially after patch 2.5 in which the devs specifically pointed out that Survivors now have a momentum when vaulting… after the patch, they still get hit! Sure, Killers have a reach with their attacks, but when you are over the window, and you even took 1 or 2 steps, you should not get hit. It's ridiculous.
[*]Getting hit AFTER pallet-stunning the Killer. Yes, it does happen. You stun the Killer but somehow the hit they were preparing finishes and goes through WHILE they just got stunned.
[*]Spawning (almost) next to the Killer: Maps are small enough making it hard to avoid & hide from the Killer, but the fact that sometimes 1 second after map start the Killer is right next to you is simply unfair.
[*]I feel like there are way too many aura detection perks for the Killers. Worst part of it is that you don't know if the Killer has one active until they surprisingly find you. You think you are well hidden at your spot and the Killer just comes right at you. This is confusing at first, because even if the Killer is zoning in on you, you don't really expect them to have a detection perk. You suppose  that it's just the Killer's patrol route, but no, they know where you are and you get hit. I'm pretty sure a lot of Survivors feel the same way.
[*]Your teammates killing themselves on the hook. First occasion when they get hooked they go ahead and try to unhook themselves, then refuse to struggle. This is one form of rage quit and team-ruining.
[/list]
[b]Killer[/b]
[list]
[*]Endless loops/juke sections. There are places, such as shacks and big roundabout spots where you can't get enough momentum to deliver a hit, because there's either a vault window or a long wall. If you spend more than 10 seconds there, you are hindering yourself and giving the Survivors a lot of free repair time. It's difficult to remember to never get into a loop, because the game makes you think that you will be able to catch the Survivor. Just keep it in mind: don't get pulled into this kind of loop. Leave the teabagger alone, let him keep spamming the crouch, go find another target.
[*]In all seriousness, I think as a Survivor it's more alarming to disturb the crows than utilizing them as a Killer. Can you remember when was the last time you found a Survivor because of the crows? I bet you can't. I'm sure though that you are upset about disturbing them as a Survivor, every match. Right? Haven't tried Spies from the Shadows perk yet, so maybe it's my bad.
[*]It's often difficult to follow scratch marks, even when you chase a single Survivor. Scratch marks are so scattered all over the place that you kinda get confused about them. I don't think that forcing the Killer to equip the Predator perk is a good way to solve this. If you are a veteran player you might still end up going the wrong way when following a scratch mark trail. The Survivor didn't do a slalom and you aren't a bad player, it's just confusing, that's all.
[/list]
[b]Community[/b]
[list]
[*]Toxic player base. I really mean that. Even more toxic than any other. Combine the toxicity of every toxic game on the planet and multiply it by 3. The reason is because this game has 2 types mixed together: the communicated toxicity (written or said), or the in-game behavior toxicity (tea bagging, head shaking, team-ruining, etc). There are too many ways to heavily hurt someone's match experience, either being a Killer or Survivor. If you thought you are a calm, reasonable, friendly player, think twice, because I can guarantee that this game will mess you up.
[*]Rage quitters ruining the whole match for everyone. Survivors get hit once, downed once or hooked once and they rage quit. One generator repair done, boom, Killer rage quits. Hex totem cleansed, boom, Killer rage quits. So on and so forth. Get over it people, it’s a game. Every player's goal is the beat the opponent, that means everyone will have losses too, not just wins.
[*]Tunneling/Camping Killers. The fact that a Killer can camp the hook and tunnel the same player and still get a PiP out of the whole match is simply ridiculous. Some sort mechanic should be implemented, that could cause camping Killers feel the urge to do something proactive. Devs are OK with tunneling and camping, since they don't accept complaints in this matter. The community on the other hand, despise campers and tunnelers. Something needs to happen to alleviate this.[/list]

Game is a great concept and could potentially be good in the future.

Pros:
Fun concept.
Very new feeling.
Definitely gives me the spooked vibes or thrill of hunting down other players.
Lots of replayability.
Quick matches in theory lead to lots of gametime.

Cons:
Games take twice as long to find as they do to complete.
Lots of annoying game abuse happens ingame once you have the misfortune of playing against people who know the game in depth.
Spaghetti code matchmaking means you'll be playing with above players potentially your first game in.
Spaghetti code leads to lots of game breaking bugs.
Devs are horribly slow to patch things that are not working in the game, such as Abilities, game mechanics, or literally being able to use survivor-side perks as a Killer to essentially have map-wide wall hacks.
Community is as bad, maybe worse than those of games with notoriously horrible communities, like League of Legends.
Devs continue to release add-on content without patching the above mentioned game-breaking bugs, often with the add-on content adding more bugs to the game.

There's a lot of cons here, but the game is fun, it would just be more fun(playing for more than 1/3 of the time spent with the game opened) if the devs gave a crap about making the game what it could(and should) be.
This game has a plethora of issues. If the killer has bad internet, you suffer and get punished for it, rubberbanding and "skillchecks" make it impossible to play with lag. There have been promises of dedicated servers coming eventually, but my question is why weren't they here from the beginning? Any bugs or issues (and there have been plenty) are not addressed in a timely manner and are often put to the side while skins and cosmetics are released instead. there are many balancing issued with killer vs survivors and perks being unbalanced, and some killers are so underpowered at the moment they're barely being played as of late. If you're looking for casual play there's not much for you in that department either, there is a rank system that is in place that promotes people playing toxic and sweaty as if it were the olympics, so unless you have 4 other friends and want to play in the "kill your friends", that's what you have to deal with. I really tried to stay with the game in hopes that it would grow as i play, but I'm tired of waiting as I don't see any real progress or interest of progress being made.
It's a fun game.. If it was called Lobby Simulator 2016.

For real though, the game itself is fun, however it literally takes about 10-20 minutes to get into a match with 4 friends. Don't buy this game unless you really like sitting in a lobby doing fuck all.
An otherwise fantastic game polluted by excessive survivor bias, the developers' self-styled French-Canadian trolling and a steaming fistful of community toxicity. If you need to play a game as a killer where you develop a potential neuroses, then this is the one for you. Some fun is to be had, but at what cost?
The game has an interesting concept, but is let down by the poor matchmaking. If you are grouping with friends, expect to wait 30+ minutes for a single game. If you are unlucky, you may end up spending 3x more time waiting than actually playing.
I've got over 550 hours in this game. So far every single patch they put out destroys the game bit by bit. And maybe they'll fix it and maybe it will be there forever. The devs will change things that have been standard in the game just to accommodate some new change they plan on making.  This game started really great! Was really fun and enjoyable. It felt fair and everyone had a good time. Now the game just feels like work. You'll spend most of your games holding left click hitting time events. The game lacks balance now. Every patch they screw something else up. It's almost as if the devs don't even play their own game. I'm done with this game. Don't buy it unless you want to put out a small fee every couple months to fund their $#!t show of a game.
I really enjoy this game despite some of it's flaws and issues. Although I don't agree with a lot of changes the devs make they are still trying and it's a way better situation development wise than some months and years ago. BUT if I can't play the game 50 % of the time because of lobby or loading screen freezes (as killer and survivor) and another 25 % teammates have those issues so we're just 3 players it makes me want to uninstall this game. I can not even count the amount of party streamers, envelopes and other offerings I have lost because of those problems (because for whatever reason since more than 2 years the offerings still are not consumed at the beginning of a match but after the lobby is ready which is just unbelievable).

I wish I could write a review about the content of DBD and not one where I'm "b*tching" about some bugs. But it just happened too many times and overshadowed the good gaming experiences I've had the rounds before to justify writing anything else.
horrible matchmaking and horrible disconnect problems. also the updates don't fix anything. now to keep your rank you have to earn way more points after the update. it was at 7k points which was reasonably fair but now u derank if u can't even hit 10. yes i just played a match. the developers need to start addressing the issue as this is a common problem with disconnects and loading screen to freeze when u try to join a game. it is a great game when it works but for some reason after like midnight this games starts to lose connection all the time.
Go ducking learn how to code a game since the reporting system is broken (understand "has never been implemented") no one seems to care about as soooooooo many cheaters have been spotted then reported in the game but ducking noooooooothing to do with it. 

Annnnnnd now this $hit randomly crashes buuut never came across any issue with the shop section hey hey heyyyyyyy. 

Ok, getting a fix or dedicated servers at the very least before summer 2019 would be a great achievement so hey dreaming still is cost-free lmao.

Downvoted. 

When could we expect to get rid of p2p? 
Waiting for summer 2k19 to come so that we (hopefully) eventually can be playing on dedicated servers that serve the shee.. users (my bad) with a decent latency after 2 years so it finally becomes possible to avoid hosts who download porn while playing this $hit is a shame. 

Enjoy your steam review.

Period.
The game is unplayable at the moment because of save file error 300 the game is fun tho but wont suggest it atm wait for a possible fix before buying the game.
Its an ok game with friends but honestly... the devs are the worst part of it that makes you lose respect for the game. Bugs arent fixed and community toxicity is not even considered to be fixed. Streamers exploit and teach glitches to their viewers and arent even considered being banned because they promote the game. They are trying to take money for a game that should no doubt be considered a beta with how badly it runs. (Game crashing on start up, long ♥♥♥ loading time, hours of queue times, crashes within the game, constant loss of progress and many more negatives lmao)

Good spooks, everything else is poo doe. :0 :0 :0
I would not recommend this for many reasons.
First the game is significantly unbalanced, I have played teams for extended amounts of time and find that the killer is given more buffs each patch while the survivors are nerfed into the ground. It has been so far that it is now a joke in the survivor community that the developers are babying the killers since they cry the most.
Secondly the look, I cant bear looking at the differences between older maps and new maps because the developers are not replacing assets. Its ridiculous that you look at a nice clean hook with pretty painted textures then go to older maps to find a hook looking like it came from a ps2 game.
Thirdly the animation, I have seen better animations done by my classmates and they have been doing 3d animation for 2 months now. Please fix the crouching animation for the male characters as they look like they are going to crap themselves with a strange bent back while going around, along with the leg rig being a bit to low on the model.
Finally hitboxes, come on we all know it only takes 1 button to press to fix them so please sort this out its embarrassing.

I have put hundreds of hours into this game and would like to see improvements to overall content rather then new killer and survivor and maybe a failed side game. I want to enjoy this game do not tell me to just play something else fix the issues and maybe you wont have your community crying constantly.
(If there are any typos I'm sorry)
New to the game, but it seems broken in that I will be unable to play as killer at rank 20 unless I have 30+ mins to spend sitting in my lobby, waiting for survivors. 

With matchmaking this poorly configured, how the devs intends to grow the game's playerbase this far from launch is beyond me.
I think we've done a pretty good job so far

Fix you fucken shit devs


(also thanks volvo for the censorship)


ps the assymetric game idea makes for some bs matches, glad I got sandbagged with my bloody party streamers for a grand total of 3.8 points
I do love this game, but the community has fucked it up completely.

No point of buying it since the game has too many bugs/unbalanced gameplay & a shit ton of hackers


out of 10?

6.5/10
Good game with probably the worst community I have ever seen in a game. The players you encounter are beyond toxic not matter what the outcome of the game is. If you win prepare to be spammed with insults about the way you choose to play the game and be told to commit suicide. If you lose you will always be gloated upon, told to uninstall, kill yourself yet again, etc. A good game with a fun concept is ruined by a community that makes Call of Duty on the Xbox look like a great environment.
I've been waiting for people to join my game and waiting on failed loading screens for hours and now I can't even refund the game. You would think after three years this would already be fixed.

(edit) I've been playing as survivor. Every server has someone who paid for a killer that's stupidly overpowered. Killers with guaranteed one-shots, killers who are able to see you through walls, killers who tie up all your time with their abilities removing any chance of ever repairing a generator again. I would be okay with this if the killers weren't locked behind microtransactions and they actually planned on fixing this obvious balancing issue, but instead, they keep it in the game as motivation for people to spend more money on the game. They can justify this because you can technically still get these killers without spending money by spending 9000 iridescent shards on a certain day to get the killer you want. But so far, I've been playing the game for 9 hours and I only have ~800 iridescent shards. At this rate it would take me 101 hours to get enough for one killer not taking into account the increasing amount of xp you need to level up to get iridescent shards. microtransactions of this calibre are fine on like a free mobile game, but when they're in a game that's already $22 to begin with, i get pretty pissed.
i used to enjoy this game a lot. really loved playing it with my friends. plenty of jumpscare opportunities and general adrenaline rush inducing content. however lately every killer we are paired with uses "hex: ruin" which at a high level makes the game almost unplayable. even when i play killer i am constantly body blocked and farmed for points by survivors. game: okay. player base: toxic. wouldn't recommend it.
This game can be fun if you SWF with a 4 man team. Pugs will RQ with NO consequence at all, so playing with just 1 friend or solo can be super irritating.
Game play itself is incredibly fun, but oh My loRd fix the bugs! 
In average of one hour play, I get kicked out of game once(force close) and get stuck in infinite loading screen twice, don't you think that's a little too much?

All of DBD players wants this game to have less bugs instead of more DLC - get on it PLEASE. 

Makes me regret that I bought DLC for this game..
Apparently, the developers don’t understand that an online game is not playable with more than 200 ping. There's no option to filter bad ping servers (the killer) and the host can't kick high ping players. You have to enter and exit games until you find a decent ping host.
Very buggy and just very bad i have over a 100 hours and every time they update it they make worse and worse DO NOT RECOMMEND the devs have no idea what they're doing do not waste your money
Great game, but do not buy till the following issues are fixed:
Dedicated servers (the game is unbearably laggy)
Stability improvement (1 out of 5 games I join my game crashes)
Improved Community (this cant really be fixed by the devs but the community for this game is comparable to the toxicity of overwatch)
Correct game balancing (Instead of the devs fixing the balancing by giving the killers better perks or nerfing the survivors they have decided to make the hitboxes stupidly broken, this just adds to the frustration I feel while playing this game)
This game is really great and with some issue fixes it would be fun again, but until then it deserves a negative review. .
so freaking done with this game and its endless bugs, lags, and especially the freezes when the match is loading. I think I wasted more time waiting for the matches here to load and restarting the game every 5th match than on any other game in this world.
I love bug by daylight its works all the time the hitboxes are broken the killers are broken glitches are terrible just don't waist money on this game
You pay for this game...but then have to pay multiple times, again, to get the rest of the characters. Little to no attempt at balancing in this game, with many killers able to essentially clear the entire distance of the map in a couple seconds. The gameplay is little more than holding left click on a generator and pressing space bar, hoping that the killer does not happen to have some random perk that let's him see you through walls.

It should be noted that any and all complaining will be ignored. Why? Because they are making money this way, and nothing matters more than $$$
This game is the WORST! All i want to do is torture and kill everyone and yet all the killers in this game struggle to put a human on the ground. Then as a noob i run into pros frequently as survivors talking in discord and sending one person to troll the killer while they get 3 generators online by the time i catch this one person dropping all the pallets after playing ring around the rosey across the whole map. Then the survivors send one to save that person and by the time i find the next person, because camping a hooked soul is frowned upon, they have the next two generators online. Then they know the killer is struggling so they then go and hunt the killer down with flashlights and just stand around you trading turns with a flash light to increase their blood points. All the while leaving you the killer helpless, hopeless, Frustrated, and most of all a weakling. I'm suppose to feel like i won if i even hooked them but then my game player name should be called the hooker not a killer. I'm the killer not a teddy bear.
I used to love this game back when it was actually fun to play. but now It's just so boring, they tried to balance the game and it has just made the game less fun. they took away all the fun you could have as survivor and made killer gameplay really easy. when i play killer as hillbilly I feel like the survivors never even have a chance to win because of all the gen stopping perks I could use, and my movement speed with the chainsaw makes them disconnect most games because they can't get any gens done. also they have removed so many pallets since the last time I played this game that it is actually insane, when I play killer all i have to do is go to a gen and get them to waste a pallet and not tunnel and I win because they will run out of pallets eventually and can't do anything at that point. the 360s for survivors got nerfed, as well as implementing broken hitboxes and auto aim so you can't even really get away by doing fun spins anymore when playing survivor like you used to be able to do. the dlc maps are absolute garbage for killer and survivor for the most part, the original maps were a lot better. and why did they get rid of darkest moonlight while keeping in mori and noed the two most cancer things in this game? they are finally nerfing decisive but it was never really even a problem because it's so easy to dribble the survivors. as someone who plays both survivor and killer it just is not fun to play this game anymore the ranking system is pointless and the higher rank you achieve the more toxic assholes you have to go up against both as killer and as survivor. as survivor if you want to survive against good killers you have to run the same broken perks just to survive, while the killers get a good amount of perks and builds they can choose from the most annoying are the gen stopping ones. Doctor and Legion both give me cancer as survivor, because games against them last an eternity, especially when they cheese and patrol 3 gens, or when legion tunnels. They have also nerfed flashlights which is kinda understandable but at the same time a purple flashlight is near impossible to even get from a bloodweb as survivor so I don't think they should have been nerfed to the extent that they have been now. They should not have changed the ranking system from where they had it before when you could get ranked up by hooking and not by how many kills or gens the survivors do counting against you because it just leads to a guarantee that you will run into killers that suck but have noed and get one kill at the end of the game and camp to try to at least get a safety pip, without fail it litterally happens every game i play as survivor against a boosted killer. The things i like is that there is a lot less infinites but some maps still have them and long walls on strode map are cancer. there's  long walls that could randomly generate on the map and it's impossible to catch survivors, especially when the long wall has two windows or some pallets near it. Other than long walls on strode map and occasional T walls placements killer is so easy and boring. Please add some rewards for ranking up because there is like no incentive at all to do so at this point. I don't think the game is bad, but it has somewhere along the way lost what made it fun. It's much better now than what it was at when there was no survive with friends or when they first implemented it and it was literally impossible to find a match and you had to keep readying up, or when there was infinites on every map, but it's just not that fun anymore. Maybe they can add more game modes and stuff and fix some of the bugs that they have and it would be fun but untill then i'm not gonna be playing this game consistently anymore. Maybe they could add coms to this game as well, similar to how friday the 13th had them to spice things up but idk what they could do at this point.
I used to enjoy this game, I really did. I played this as my only game for the last two years. Almost 1000 hours. These recent changes, the seemingly zero effort spent fixing bugs and glitches and a bias heavily favoring the killer I just can't recommend it anymore. Toxic community aside.... 

I have bought every DLC until we got Legion. That was the beginning of the end for me. Just not fun anymore. 

Save your money honestly. Maybe buy it on sale but I do not think its worth full price.
3 Years and this game will still freeze in loading screens... Devs come off as money grabbers.

Do not buy this unless you like bugs, toxic players and again devs who will not update you on shit.
I realy cant enjoy this game, the concept is pretty funny, but it is not fun.
The "skill checks" are just realy boring and are in my opinion a lazy way to distract you. 
This game is Peer to Peer, mean it has no dedicated server, this causes you to lag extreamly when the killer has bad internet.
It also has Terriblehitboxes. The P2P lag and the Hitboxes causing a lot of problems and make this game extreamly frustating.

edit: And i dont think DLC worth of 85€ belongs in a 20€ game without dedicated servers.
(yea you can get it through play time, but it takes a realy long time)
Imagine playing killer against a toxic team and killing all of them and they only got one gen done and getting to the end screen so you can talk to them and they are being assholes but once I say something its oh you can't say that enjoy the ban like ok sorry the devs are a bunch of betas that ban you for saying mean words on the internet even though this game is m rated and like holy shit its a word you fucking retards grow the fuck up inbreds
I'm gunna make sure anyone I know does not purchase this game until DEVs implement some kind of deterent for all the DC's from survivors. 

I can't play one match without someone DC'ing to avoid being killed. It ruins the game. There has to be a way to distribute 30/60/90 minute bans for repeat offenders.

FIX IT!
Garbage game that is 100% riddled with crashes on a regular basis run by devs only trying to cash in on cosmetics. It's too late for me now to give it up, but don't buy it if you haven't already.
The game is okay, mostly shining in killer diversity and the good balance and interplay between killers and survivors.}

However, there are several things very wrong with this: the bugs, the learning curve, and the toxicity.
The bugs aren't too bad, but they often screw up the loading screen, causing 10 minute long waits or game freezes. Also, the game is really really hard to learn, at least in my experience. I nearly have 200 hours in and I'm okay at survivor but still at the bottom ranks as killer. Finally, the toxicity. People say "just avoid end game chat," but this doesn't save you from toxic gameplay tactics. Also, the game would be easier to learn if people were willing to give advice, but toxic players are unwilling to give advice.

DBD is first and foremost a masochistic experience. If you like being miserable, you'll like DBD. However, Dark Souls is way better at this and much cheaper, play that instead.
Do not buy this game, please do not support these developers.

With the recent announcement of a nintendo switch port of Dead by Daylight, I've lost all hope I had for already terrible developers. The game already runs like absolute **** on its existing console ports and could use much more dev work on every platform. This is appalling behaviour. Here's a taste of how incompetent these devs are:

-Hitboxes for killers have been broken for years.

-Players can disconnect from games as many times as they want with absolutely no punishment. This also leads to people deranking by disconnecting intentionally and ruining hundreds of games for others with no consequences. A game with built-in smurphing, just what I've always wanted.

-There is no (or barely any) filter for matchmaking based on ping. Enjoy queuing and re-queuing for 10+ minutes until you finally find a lobby that isn't 300 ping.

-There are excessively powerful and game ruining items and offerings that you can bring into games. Here's a fun one: usually your third time being put on the hook will kill you, but with the 'ebony mori' offering, the killer has the ability to straight up kill and remove people from the game after they've only been hooked once! For an idea of how the devs balance things, it used to be that you could just straight up kill people without even hooking them, but it was changed to this much tamer, "better" version. Laughable.

-If you queue with friends, you must manually reinvite them back to your lobby after each game you play. Here's the kicker: you must leave the separate lobbies it puts you back into after the match, because you are no longer able to invite people in that lobby after queuing once as a group. You must start a new lobby. What? This is the easiest change ever to make to the game and has been requested since the beginning of the game. Still not fixed.

-The developers mislead and lie to their players. With the recent reveal of the newest DLC killer, The Legion, it was implied that you would be able to play as any of the 4 members of the killer band. Nope! Welcome to Dead by Daylight DLC matroska dolls, where you must pay for 2 of the killers in the group if you've already bought the killer! What? They're just cosmetic changes, but they look much nicer than the 2 designs you get by default. How lovely.

-The in-game progression system is awful. You use 'bloodpoints' you gather from playing games to unlock perks that you can use with your characters. That doesn't sound too bad but when most of the perks that are good are gated behind having another one of your characters at near max level, it quickly turns into korean-rpg level of grinding to unlock decent perks. You better like the ones you went for, because you'll be stuck with them for quite a while! Even more appealing than that is that on the killer side of things, almost every good killer perk is on a dlc killer. But wait, "there must be a system to get dlc perks, like it's some kind of free to play game, even though I've already purchased the game, right?"

Let me introduce you to the holy 'Shrine of Secrets'. The Shrine of Secrets "randomly" places 4 perks per week as available for purchase with in-game, earnable, level-based currency. I say randomly because the best and most necessary perks for some reason appear extremely rarely on the shrine. Odd. Oh, and perks from "f2p" base game characters appear on the shrine as frequently as DLC perks. I'm not making this up.

-The devs have literally no clue about how to design their game. Our friends The Legion from earlier are a prime example of that. The Legion circumvent all of the mechanics survivors have to run away, and that's only the beginning of their naughty list. In Dead by Daylight, the survivors can make use of pallets and windows to run away from the killer. For most killers, these will extend the chase and buy the survivors time. The killer must break the pallet to get through it, or vault through a window at around half the speed a survivor can vault it. With their power, The Legion just jumps over these objects like they're a survivor. The devs have literally and figuratively designed a character that jumps over the gameplay elements of their game. The Legion is quite symbolic, really. They also run at mach speed while using their power and have no penalty for missing their attacks. Even the other killer that can circumvent pallets and windows (The Nurse) has a penalty for missing attacks. Oh, I forgot to mention The Nurse, the other killer they released who can circumvent gameplay elements. By teleporting. Small details. 

Ironically The Legion isn't even good despite this because of other aspects of their character. They're just incredibly unfun to play against. Oh and The Nurse? She's the best killer in the game by a landslide. Obviously.

-The in-game community is one of the worst I've ever seen. There is this weird, incredibly primal and childish mentality of "it's us against them" which is incredibly common among players who play mainly killer or survivor. Survivors and killers will likewise go out of their way to try to frustrate others in-game because "I was up against such an asshole killer/survivor last match, let's see how they like it!" There are people who complain about survivors "gen rushing"; which in other words is: "completing the objective of the game."

-The killer has such a power to make the game unfun for individual survivors within a game that killer players are literally expected to "play nice" and self moderate the amount of fun they let the survivors have. This is done by choosing to cycle attacks between different survivors, to the killer's detriment... Absolutely ludicrous. 

-The game is "ranked" mode, only. No casual mode or anything else, just "ranked". I personally don't have too much of a problem with this idea in theory, except for the fact they do not design the game around it in any way whatsoever. There is no voice chat available in-game so players who queue together have an extreme advantage that other survivors don't have. This is not accounted for in the matchmaking system so grouped players are treated the same as solo queue players. On top of that, killers see when people join their lobbies and many killers who care a lot about their rank will refuse to play against grouped players, further increasing the delay in matchmaking. 

The casual and serious players are forced to mix together in the absolute worst way. As a survivor who cares about ranks you will be paired up with survivors who will use nonstrategic, often game sabotaging (wink, wink) strategies which will throw the match. As a casual player you are plagued by killers who use unbalanced, unfun addons and offerings as a way to power-rank; as well as other survivors who will play selfishly, screwing you over just to increase their own rank. It is the worst of both worlds.

The game also has heavy rng based on map, map generation, which killer with what perks and addons you are up against, yadda yadda yadda— so much so that the idea of a ranked system for the game is a joke among highly skilled players. Not to mention that the ranked system is hardly a measure of skill itself, because of how ranking up works. As long as you do the bare minimum and complete one objective by mindlessly holding left click for 60 seconds at least one time per game, it is incredibly likely you won't lose rank, regardless of how well or poorly you played. This means that the players at top ranks are often those who just play the most, and are frequently not the most skilled players the game has to offer. At some points it can be observed that the higher you rank up, the worse the teammates you get are. "Ranked." Oh yeah and the rankings reset every month. Again, small details.

Tragically this game actually has a fun foundation that can be quite addicting, under all the layers of ****. It's like a **** layer cake. 

The ultimate **** layer cake.
Devs will ban people without citing what sort of thing was an issue. Reporting for harassment and not telling someone what they did or specifically said is just obnoxious and extremely petty. This game also has major bugs with a good amount of the killers and an extreme lack of guiding as to how to unlock stuff if you don't want to pay for overpriced dlc. Said dlc will contain a survivor with 1 useful perk (if you are lucky), a killer with 1 useful perk, and nothing else. Not to mention, the better perks are on killers you have to buy with either the paid in game currency or real money. You can get those perks in the silly rotation thing that swaps every wednesday @ 6PM Central, but there are 2 killer perks and 2 survivor perks so your odds of landing them are pretty low. That and the fact that they don't show you how to buy killers with the ir shards is clear evidence that they want to hide the ability to purchase said characters with in game unlockable currency, but still make it technically possible so that they can say they weren't hiding it. Only about 4 killers are really good once you hit about rank 4+ and while 3 of them are killers you get for free, the perks that some of them start with are garbage and unless you really want to put time into this game and actually unlock everyones things (this will require at least a month playing for multiple hours on end). The game is wildly unbalanced with cheap perks on both sides, although being a survivor isn't terrible if you have a head. No dedicated servers brings down the quality of this game massively as it gives the killer an advantage they are the host every single time and not the person in the lobby with the best ping. This gives the killer a leg up in chases as unless you immediately learn how to loop properly and know the maps and its mechanics and have decent perks, you will get fucked. This game will not tell you how to play it properly and to learn to do so you will have to go to either youtube or twitch.

Overall, pissed I got a ban for no reason (or at least you weren't willing to show me what happened that made you want to ban me, and that I think the game needs massive reworks on most of the main objectives in the game. If you can get past those hurdles, it's an alright game but is nothing you should pay full price for. G2A or some other key website is where you should buy the game and the dlc if you choose to waste your money.
Strongly do not recommend buying it. I have 700hrs (so noone can say im beginner), been to rank 1 multyple times. Killers are super toxic such as survivours. Even at rank 1 where you expect to have better and more fun experience with less camping/tunneling killers and its the opposite. when you play killer the fair way and come against a well organised "survie with friends group" you will most likely get demolished, and on top of that there will be anoying flashlight clicks and teabags. waste of money/time.
Used to be a good game. Now it just caters to killers and is completely unbalanced. hit boxes are crazy big so good luck juking. If you want to be a killer get ready to wait 15 minutes to get a lobby. takes forever as a survivor to get the perks you want.  Needs a complete rebalance.
So I'm not as experienced on PC but after reaching rank 1 on both sides of the spectrum on Xbox, then moving to PC I'll put it bluntly. Do not buy this game. Like you've probably read, it's a great concept with horrible execution. They keep trying to fix old problems by putting in new systems and basically for each balance tweak we get 2 new bugs pop up and there are no fixes to the old bugs, but new cosmetics come out every other week.

This game will crash, you will be harassed in game and post game, and the player rank, player level, character level, bloodpoint, and shard grind will probably be enough to turn new players away. It's just so bloated with grinding, and problems that those moments of joy or triumph that people come to this game for are quickly taken away by the overwhelming amount of punishment a player has to face.

DLC and updates are consistent and maps are free, which is really nice, but the content is usually a flash in the pan, then another thing for the community to be toxic about. Just as well DBD has it's cake and eats it too by charger for the base game, DLC, and cosmetics. With 9 DLC currently, all priced at 6.99, plus 19.99 for the base game, it would cost about $83 just to have access to all the content. This is before grinding to get to actually use it. This can also end up putting pay gates up around content that might end up being meta.

I'm a fan of this game, and because they have a strong hold on the multiplayer horror market, I'll still be playing it through this unsatisfactory time. Still, coming back in to it on a new platform and seeing what the experience is from the top to the bottom I can tell you that unless you're a die hard horror fan, have friends to play this with, or already know dead by daylight and are willing to jump back in you will regret this purchase.

Wait until the summer when there are sales, and DBD starts using dedicated servers. I'm hoping for the best, but expecting the worst.
Most of my hours are idled, I haven't ever really played this game. So I'm doing the tutorial today, playing as killer, on the third or fourth tutorial, bug where I'm stuck in a tree and can't move. Can't restart, keyboard working fine, I have to exit the tutorial, now I must start from the beginning, yeah bye, uninstalled.

Also there are barely any graphical options and the stupid game is capped at 60fps? I have a 144hz screen, that's useless to me. Why the hell is this stupid game so popular?
Dead by Daylight, the game where you aren't allowed to play how YOU wanna play. I like this game and the ideas of it, but what I don't like is being harassed and insulted because of my play style. The community has literally ruined this game and will continue to ruin this game until something is done against these players. Survivors go crazy when they see you stand by the hook for 2 seconds and when the post game chat comes, they harass and insult you for not letting them go. Sometimes you'll get a survivor to friend you just to PERSONALLY send you a message that you suck. Other just comment on your profile. I don't know, I think I'm just salty because I got yelled at for getting 2 kills in Dead by Daylight, the community is gonna kill this game. Do I recommend it? No you'll just be annoyed with everyone you play against because they didn't agree with the way you play the game.
Pros:
- Simple premise and gameplay, no memorizing keybinds or complex mechanics
- Great variety of Survivors and Killers + some negligible customization options
- Excellent atmosphere including the map designs, timing of musical stingers, variety of music and sounds, etc.
- Very tense and exciting moments created organically through the foundation of the game

Cons:
- Way too many complicated items/perks for casual play
- Only hiding location is a red closet that always looks the same; only means of escaping is to repair generators (or enter a hatch that appears if you're the last one alive)
- Small maps
- Absolutely unplayable wait times (at lower levels, can't speak for the density of players at higher levels (yes there is a leveling system and it's pretty convoluted))

Conclusion:
Fun game, absolutely worth a few hours of play, but only if you have a group of friends to play with in a premade. If you're a loner, don't buy this game unless you are keen on spending an hour waiting to play 1 measly match.
Garbage game as long as spirit and legion is in. This game needs to hire an ACTUAL mathematician to calculate the balancing for them because obviously this isn't working for so many reasons.
POSITIVE
- The game can make a lot of fun when the team works together and the killer plays in a fair way.
- The style of playing in this game is a nice concept. 

NEGATIVE IN GAMEPLAY
- Killers are camping often near the hooks
- Killers tunneling a single player until the dead
- Stupid perks which make the game for the killer much more easier and the life as survivor much more harder
- To much hooks or to long wiggle time, take it how you want. Something has to be changed!
- Totems are hard to find, specially on bright maps you can't see clearly if they are burning or not

NEGATIVE IN MATCHMAKING
- You join so often in high ping lobbies, the developer doesn't think to change anything. Maybe a matchmaking pre-selection on latency or region would be a great idea?! The bad ping benefits has only the killer because he hosts the lobby.
- If you lose the connection to steam friends the game can't be played anymore. You get disconnect from game lobby and you can't do anything till it's working again.
- Often random disconnects from lobby in loading screen as survivor, but the lobby still exists further.


All in all, they bring out a lot of content for additional money but they aren't solving the basic connection problems in the game. Adding micro transaction to earn even more money doesn't change anything to make the game free of that problems. It destroys the fun when you look 20min for a playable lobby or atleast for a lobby from where you get not an disconnect. Annoying af!
20 Hour Grind to unlock dlc or 7$ (Good Grind)
250+ Hours to unlock a cool cosmetic or 10$ (Shit Grind)
Freddy doesn't play like himself. Biggest iconic killer dissapointment.
Legion is a joke of a killer that was also advertised poorly as 4 killers when its 2.
Trapper and Wraith have boring gameplay compared to rest of killers also.
Spirit is best variety killer with any perk viable on her.
No Candyman (Come on get the character.)
There great dev team that is very supportive to the community.
So community will let them slide on shady game company practices.
Will change review when fixed in some way but cannot reccomend this to people in current state.
This game is insanely broken and will always be because the devs will never fix it instead they just keep pushing new dlc instead of fixing old ones. the community is so toxic and half of them cant play the game legit and every other match you get in will have a hacker or will have half the players because the game crashes every 5 secs. half the killers are broken and some of the survior perks are broken. would not recomend to new gamers but is good for people who like to learn or people who like to make themself suffer
TL:DR - Good for casual players who expect to play less than 50 hours if picked up on sale. Terrible for competitive players who like to settle down with a balanced competitive game with variety.

You can read what the game is about, it's rules and gameplay on videos. So I'm going to give the summary from the perspective of someone who really got hooked (haha) on the game with 100+ hours and rank 1 on killer but now really dislikes playing and has uninstalled.

Pro's: 
Great concept
Interesting veriety of characters
Cheap cost
Great horror thrill as a survivor

Con's: 
The most toxic community I've played with - Fellow survivors will screw you over (get you off the hook right infront of the killer) just for points. Trying to catch a survivor? Get ready for some intense teabagging around near-infinite loops
Painfully unbalanced - there is quite a strict hirearchy of good/bad perks for either side and a few mandatory ones (the killer version requiring a DLC purchase). There is also a very very strict hirearchy for killer characters (some killers like legion are completly unplayable at higher ranks).
Buggy as hell - one in every 5 games don't load and my sacrifices/addons get wasted. Lag and glitches will see some true bull**** happen (drop a pallet on a killer but still get hit)
Active exploits - Survivors will dc instantly if you kill them leaving you unable to get points, but they'll be around in the lobby afterwards to talk trash to you. Lots of speed hacks (you only need an extra 5% to be uncatchable)
Badly designed maps - some of the loops in the game are just a joke, 'infinite' loops also exist where the killer CANNOT catch a survivor

Overall a great concept but the flaws turn this game from a great casual gem to a frustrating toxic experience that leaves me in a worse mood than when I started playing. To add insult to injury the devs don't seem to be active in balancing the game or fixing the bugs - they just churn our DLC's for extra cash.
This is could be a fantastic game to play but has a lot of bugs that needs fixing:
-freezes constantly 
-buggy as hell in thousands of different games
-some killers are way too OP and need buffing
-some survivor perks are OP 
-lag from host can make you lose a game
-ranking system means nothing and you get points for basically anything
-need to balance the killers/survivors
-hitboxes are like halfway across the map
-needs to fix map bugs and also maps in general
-matchmaking is a pain and sometimes doesn't load at all

Overall too much needs fixing at the moment for it to be a super enjoyable game, you'll play about 20 hours realise how broken it is and get frustrated and quit. Has the potential to be great and when it works its really fun.
Don't buy this shitty ass bug of a game. Honestly these developers do NOT deserve your money. They don't care about the game nor their community. They do not focus on fixing bugs in-game. Instead they focus on cosmetics to make more and more money until, inevitably their game dies. They just want to drain every last dime out of consumers that they can.

DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME. IT IS NOT A FINISHED GAME. 

It is so horribly done it's embarrassing for game developers in general. 

Do yourself a favour and buy another game.
Was highly sceptical about buying this game, after reading positive reviews.

For me the game needs more work as it’s so complicated at what each character does and progresses.

It’s fun and enjoyable running round activating lights and generators while getting chased off variable killers, as for Freddy Krueger you could never get away from him no matter what you did making it impossible in the game.

There’s more better survival games out there in my opinion.
Unfair Gameplay. 
The Perks and the Aptitudes for the Killers are completly overpowerd. There is mostly no fun for the survivor, because there is often no way to escape. The perks of theSurvivors are a nice gimmick but not very useful and got nerved by the Gamestudio all the time.  
 So better you play an other game, because this game is just playable in a group or as a KIller.
PROBLEMS

-DON'T STAND NEXT TO TREES BECAUSE YOU SOMETIME GLITCH AND WILL NOT BE ABLE MOVE UNTIL THE KILLER DOWNS YOU AND PICKS YOU UP BUT BECAUSE THE KILLER KNOWS YOU ARE GLITCHED HE LEAVES YOU FOR THE HOLE GAME TO STAND AND WATCH (THIS GLITCH HAS BEEN IN THE GAME FOR YEARS STILL NO FIX) 

-FACE CAMPED (EVERY 3-4 GAMES WHEN ABOVE RANK 10)

-CRASHING OR INFINITE  LOADING SCREEN (AFTER TAKING OFFERING SO ITS JUST GONE)

- THE GAME IS GOING ON 3 YEARS OLD AND STILL NO DEDICATED SERVERS 

-INSIDIOUS PERK PROMOTES CAMPING KILLERS (NO HEART BEAT WHEN STANDING STILL SO JUST CAMP NEXT TO HOOK FARM THE SURVIVOR) THIS ONE IS NOT THAT OFTEN BUT STILL BAD 

-JUGGLING SO YOU CANT USE ABILITY TO GET OFF (HUGE PROBLEM) 

-LOBBY GLITCH (IF LOBBY IS FULL AND ONE SURVIVOR LEAVES THEY WILL NOT BE REPLACED UNTIL ANOTHER SURVIVOR LEAVES)

 -EVERY TIME YOU END A MATCH U HAVE TO BACK OUT TO MAIN MENU AND RE-INVITE FRIENDS THROUGH STEAM (NOT REALLY A PROBLEM BUT ANNOYING AND CHAT IS JUST FULL OF INVITES) GIVE US PARTY SYSTEM 

-THE META IS A JOKE ESPECIALLY AT RANK 1-7 YOU SEE THE SAME 3 KILLERS WITH THE SAME PERKS (SAME WITH SURVIVORS PERKS)
JUST SHOWS HOW UNBALANCED THE GAME IS  

INSTEAD OF FIXING THESE PROBLEMS EVEN JUST THE BUGS AND CRASHES THE DEVELOPERS JUST BRING OUT NEW BROKEN KILLERS FOR THE £££££ THESE BUGS HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME FOR AT LEAST A YEAR AND STILL NOT FIXES

BUT 

IF NON OF THESE THING HAPPEN IT IS A LOAD OF FUN 

PEOPLE WILL SAY I'M SALTY OR BAD BUT I AM RANK 1 SURVIVOR AND AT THAT RANK IT IS BORING SAME 3 KILLERS ALWAYS WITH THE SAME PERKS 


I DO STILL PLAY THIS GAME DESPITE ALL OF THESE ISSUES BECAUSE IT CAN BE A FUN GAME  

PS. PROXIMITY CHAT WOULD BE NICE
Most repetitive game ever. I played two matches, both as the Killer. I won one of them. I don't even wanna try Survivor, nor play again as a Killer.

Wouldn't even play if it were free. Thank God, I only paid €7.
Dead By Daylight is a great game in theory. If you have friends you can have fun playing as survivors called (SWF), or if you have no friends you can be a killer (this is a much harder version of the game.) The game has a lot of grind (low on content) but the grind isn't totally necessary as the perks don't do a whole lot and most perks are kind of useless. The game is terribly balanced and is immensely stacked in the killers favour.  Just kidding.  The game is totally survivor sided and SWF breaks the game entirely as it is horribly imbalanced. I did have fun in my over 1000 hours playing this game but generally this is as survivor with a SWF.  The game is pretty boring as there isn't much to do and talking to other people is more enjoyable than the actual gameplay.  Gamers tend to be sweaty nerds in general in games, and when games are so imbalanced like this - nerds will innovate the fun out of the game through 'the meta.' The meta has changed a little bit when it comes to survivors it is no longer the Borrowed Time, Self Care, (Exhaustion Perk), Decisive Strike; as BHVR attempted to try to be a real gaming studio and put on the appearance of balance.

I can't recommend the game to anyone.  It takes 300-400 hours to learn how to play as a survivor (as there is no real ranking system) and 400-500 hours to learn a particular killer. The learning curve is very steep.  Most people will not be willing to put in the effort to really understand specific killers such as Hag or the muscle memory such as Nurse.  The easiest killer to 'git gud' with is Billy. All survivors are identical but Claudette has a brown skin and Adam has a black suit skin that provide unbelievable camo in this game. Remember - skins mean skill. 

It's a fun game. But when your the killer it locks up and hangs all the time. I have great internet and a super gaming computer it just has lots of bugs when you are hosting. They really need to be looking at logs and fixing the problems.
Game has been busted for months and they refuse to fix it. Every other game there's a problem with someone dropping from the match or the game freezes and just wont load at all.
Dont buy this game, even if it is in "sale". U wont have fun playing surviviour. Just tunneling killers.... Survive with ur friends looping surviviours... 

Not recommending. 

Its a nice game if you play it with friends, but the DLC politic is bullshit. A huge viarity of killer and survivor but 3/4 you just can get through DLCs ffor real money and thats a bit disappointing.

Also subscribe to Pewdiepie to stop T-Series
The community awful. They belittle, taunt and trash talk you at every point if you play the killer. I have never been so frustrated and mad at a game in the past two years and I use to play League of Legends.
At first good idea, then adding unbalanced skills and killers which hurts only survivors ruined the game. Don't buy anymore. Won't have fun and win with random players. Like CSGO.
This game is Fucking Shit.... It only benefits the killers, there is nothing that prevents them from camping you, they have broken addons and the game is made for them.... When u get to rank 10 It becomes fucking unbearable to play this game... Everyone just camps
Unbalanced shit game. Devs don't give a fuck about this game, they don't care about anything but money.
DO NOT BUY THIS SHIT! Why? Perks are way too op. Killers can see/hear you from anywhere if they have right perks and devs keep buffing them and nerfing survivors.
Shitty game, Devs are buffing killers and nerfing surviors over and over, not to mention they call camping a mechanic. It was fun while it lasted but the brain dead changes are becoming too much.
So the only good thing about this game is that it was only $10 on sale and so I got this minigame called hide and seek with a scary twist.... Followed by a crap load of bugs! 

PROBLEMS: 

1. Terribly unbalanced. Some killers have perks which for the most part seems to be balanced, but when there are only a couple or just  one survivor left its over powered. For instance, a clown camped a hatch, chucked his gas things and had literally no cool down. This allowed him to keep spamming it and camp the hatch and the remaining generator which was close to the hatch as well.

2. Broken hitboxes. Absolute garbag hitboxes. I thought FPS games had horrible hitboxes but this game takes the cake for being the absolute WORST. A killer can hit you even though he swung at the air. 

3. Broken animations. A killer can lunge at you from a mile away because this is how the animation works, so it completely ignores the killers original speed and goes Usain Bolt and hits you. Other times, you see a pallet and you try to throw it down but it doesn't because it doesn't show the space bar option even though you are directly in front of it and looking at it.

4. Extremely toxic community. Surviors will disconnect at the beginning for a pathetic punishment. No points and a potential derank. Wow! This is even worse when it comes to killers who disconnect because the survivors got all the generators and so the game just stops. Ridiculous how abandoners get absolutely no cool down whatsoever for ruining it for everyone else.

5. Awful servers. Your connection as a survivor depends on the killers connection. If the killers get 300 ping then so do you. If the killer lag switches and unplugs his ethernet then you freeze as well. 

Plenty of other bugs but these are the main ones that truly ruin the game.

Anyways, enjoy playing a twisted hide and seek with a bunch of bugs!
This game is trash! Absolute dumpster full of bugs making the game nothing but infuriating. As the game play itself sucks full of unbalanced things and broken mechanics. Don't waste your money on this waste of computer space.
Don't buy unless it's on sale.

Game suffers from horrible balancing issues. Right now as i'm righting this review killers are underappreciated by the developers and survivors. If you get paired with a 3-4 man group even a 2 man some times then your life will be a living hell, from the body blocking, to the flashlights killers will struggle to the point of it not being fun. 

I will change my review once it's fixed.
Whats the fun when Killers can literally see you half the game?!  Killers EASILY get over 20,000 bloodpoints while as a survivor i average about 10,000... b/c Killers have OP perks (they can equip 4 perks which allow you to see survivors while healing, when exit gates are activated,when hooked, etc.).  Would be cool if BBQ and Chili perk didnt exist which basically allows killer to see survivors for 4 seconds when someone is hooked.. so when you're up against the Nurse (who can teleport across map) game is done in 5 minutes.. if you're lucky you will die with maybe 7,000 BP (which is shit).  Should also mention I've only escaped 20x out of 68+ hrs of game play...  Fun concept but very unbalanced.  Would recommend if major changes were made so survivors can actually get points.  Don't think I'm getting my $ worth.  Also flashlights are USELESS, hate having to spend bloodpoints on useless shit.. so many complaints :(
The Idea of the the game is good but i cant recoment this game . Its veri unbalance the Kilers are too OP and fast and strong and if they have 3 HEX its imposible to escape or repair the Generators .  The Survivors are too SLOW when runing  and when you try to Wiggle to escape it takes too long to fill up the bar . The generators also takes too long to repair and one more thing some of the KILERS can be INVISIBLE and you cant see them coming oe they just teleport next to you and in some case the KILER lags soo much that you dont get any sound worning . Nerf the Kilers and Buff the Survivors and then it will be a fair game until then you will lose a lot more players and fix the damn CRASHES of the game i lost so many RARE OFERINGS.
Good game, but balancing ruins it for me.

Example, make it easier to wiggle. 
Make it easier to escape the hook.
Make the survivors run a bit faster, or the killers slower.

Yeah devs are a bit psychotic like the game itself.
(This game was gifted to me by a friend, however I have bought a majority of the DLCs with my own money)

While I found the game fun there is this major gripe that may ruin the new player experience for Killers. 

DLCs, it sucks so hard that you need to either shell out cash or pray that the Shrine has one of the perks for a specific Killer to even have a chance of dealing with survivors. Speaking of, wanna play Michael Myers effectively, another DLC character? Fuck you buy Spark of Madness to unlock a perk that makes Myers barely meta.  Wanna play the game and not get gen-rushed to hell before you even get a chance to play? Again, fuck you buy Of Flesh and Mud for a perk that EVERY Killer needs, and I mean it is basically required if you ever wanna keep playing by the single digit ranks. 

While I love playing as Myers, the headache and annoyance of the frankly shoddy balancing and inept developer team leaves this game with little to be desired other than the fun-factor of living out a horror movie. (seriously, they really dropped the ball on a lot of things, like having a bug where Freddy Krueger would experience massive movement speed slowdown using his power going on since his release in 2017, which was only recently fixed in 2019... that is a whole new level of incompetence).

A secondary gripe I have is with the toxic community, and being an asymmetrical 1v4, a majority of that toxicity comes from Survivors who can't take a loss or take winning too seriously. Is faceamping and such a bad manner thing on the Killer's behalf? Yeah it is. But it is vastly outmatched by tea-bagging, flashlight spam-clicking, blatant hypocrisy (you would see Survs crying about certain Killer perks when they run stuff like Decisive Strike and Dead Hard alongside abusing a certain skin for a character that makes them basically invisible to the naked eye). 

Personally I find a sense of satisfaction slamming Survivors like these, my profile with the comments should be proof enough of that accomplishment. 

Would I still keep playing this game despite what I said? Yes. But I highly doubt I would be suggesting it to any of my friends with enthusiasm. 

Until the team manage to get their shit together and start pushing out some proper updates instead of more DLCs that further break balancing, I would not recommend this game to anyone.


I want my money back!!

I've seen youtubers play this so I know I'd love it.

HOWEVER, I have not been able to play. I can create a lobby for a killer but no one ever shows up in it. I push survivor and I get that loading screen that never goes away. It forever says loading and keeps whiting up that logo, but never goes to a lobby. 

The game would be fun but since I can't play I want my money back so i can buy a game that will actually work and that I can actually play. Or the DEVS can fix this problem so I can play. Whichever. Just make one happen.
good idea but terrible execution. its only fun if everyone sucks at the game including yourself, and I can't stress enough how half my hours in this game are just me staring at a loading screen.
Brilliantly fun with friends, absolute trash to play alone. Just terrible.

Only worth a buy if you have a group of 3 friends that you can get to play with you.
This game actually is good. Honestly the only problem with this game is the creators and the crew team at management of the game and players most of the games people camp, tunnel and etc. And they don't bat a eye from what I see I'm not angry with the players but simply the crew members of the game who made and manage it.
Played the game for several hours. Had some fun when I started off as a joiner. However as time pass along with my rank increasing, I started to meet more and more unusual game plays. Such cases of survivors working with killers to expose the location of the other survivors, killing them and escaping through the hatch with the help of the killer to locate it. Another case where team mates purposely kills you by unhooking you right beside the killer which grants you instant down and following your death. 

Don't get me started of the balancing of the survivors and killers. I don't see how players are able to enjoy such a game where there's unbalanced abilities between survivors and killers. There are too many perks that are not used in the game. It's always the same perks between the survivors and killers. There's literally almost no point in trying other perks as they are not as universal to some perks that only DLC contents offers. Game occasionally hangs on the loading screen if the killer (Host) crashes during his loading screen. To further add on to the negative point of the game will be how the community is not playing the game as supposed to be.

Game is filled with bugs and lag issues. Match making is one hell of a problem where most players are always met with laggy killers that "teleports" or you as the survivor unable to run from the killer. Character collision hit boxes are somewhat weird and big. Killers are still able to hit survivors in cases where they actually didn't hit the survivor by visual.
When everything works as it's supposed to, it's a great game from both perspectives. But more often than not, if the game decides to be moody:
- broken lobbies,
- broken loading (often forcing you to go 1v3/1v2),
- messed up hitboxes,
- games being laggy (including broken vaults, inability to even try to hit skill checks, etc.),
- ...

Yea... sorry, but nope.
There are good nights and there are crap infested nights, and than there are those in-between. It reallly sucks when the killer decides to camp or tunnel you, especially if your "teammates" did not helped all game or screwed you over that game (not all survivors are incompetent). Can't really do much about it when he is ignoring the other survivors and it's not like the game dev can do much about it either (nor are they going to). Just because you can do something, doesn't make it right. They claim that "it's a strategy," but if that's the case, why isn't every killer doing it? It's just integrity and sportsmanship (and the good players don't need to rely on it). I've seen killers with amazing out-plays, predictions, or game sense. same can be said for the survivors. It just takes practice, skills, and a little bit of luck (I'm not that great of a survivor/killer, but I a least try to have fun, I know right? Fun in a game?). Camping on the other hand should have an actual punishment. Especially when the killer have abilities that makes it easier/encourages them to do so, i.e. hag. Why double camp? Yes, both side are toxic, that's not anything new. At least as killer you can go after and kill those people. Killers can literally ruin a game if they wanted to, by how they play, while survivors can't do that to the game (they can annoy the killer and each other though). Also as killer, you don't have to deal with idiot teammates that just wants to farm you, sit in lockers, or crouch in a corner (not to mention survivors leaving or d/cing A LOT). I see people drop all the time or rubberbanding from lag, etc. You get hit or miss when you shouldn't have, all of which makes the game unplayable. When it comes to toxicity, I understand everyone has those days (from both sides), but if you are blatant with your BM or toxic all the time, then you should take a break from gaming. That's pretty much the state of game in a nutshell.
The game itself on the other hand, hasn't been as good since the spirit update. It has changed a lot and improved in some ways, while getting worse in others, such a balancing characters. Every time there is a patch, something breaks, glitches, or a new bug is introduce. Than you have players that take advantage of it. The ranking system needs a lot of help, especially when it resets. New players should avoid playing during that time. The match making system, if there is even one, needs serious rework as well. I've seen rank 19s survivors pitted against ranked 4 killers, or vice versa often (or something along those lines). Why do you lose your offering all the time AND rank sometimes, if the killer leaves or d/c? This needs be changed since d/c happens on both sides a lot, either because of the server, the players, or the game itself. Maybe have a way for survivors be able to host too, that way it isn't just killers with the abilities choose their lobby (although I understand that that survivor would have to stay in the game)? Soo many times have games started, or even before the game starts, just to d/c right after. Why the hit boxes for paletes better than the ones on survivors? Why do killer attacks get stuck on thin air? Why do you get stuck or random or invisible objects? Some many questions unanswered. I do have to say, this is one of the better game in it's genre. I still remember feeling excited when I first saw the trailer for it. If not for my friends, I would have stopped playing this game (they were also the ones that got me hooked on it). It's honestly more enjoyable/bearable with someone. Welp, I'm done expressing my frustration and ideas about the game, hopefully this helps whoever reads it. Who knows, maybe there could even be positive changes made from both the players and developers, then I'll have to change my review. Til then, I'll just keep running/chasing til I can't anymore.
Dead By Daylight has been a game I've happily played with friends since it's release, and I've seen some really stupid things happen. 

The killers are unbalanced
The survivors are unbalanced
The grind for cosmetics isn't worth it.
Some killers are built for very high skill play and you will run into them very quickly and be easily beaten even at beginning ranks.
The ranking system is terrible
The game has nothing new. if you've played one match and lost or won that's it, it will never change.
Many Killers wait at lower ranks so they can kill new survivors.
Lot's of killers who camp you on hook and equally stupid survivors.
Some Survivors will help killers to screw you out of a win.
No protection against stream snipers besides not streaming the game.
Pointless Perks and over powered perks.

Pros: 
Fun with a full team in discord or other voice program so you can communicate and actually win.
beating a high level player can feel fantastic.
The beginning rank matches are fantastic and usually very easy to win.
The game looks okay
The seasonal events can be fun


Dead by daylight is a game that could be so much better if things were just balanced and worked out properly.

This is actually an amazing game but i won't reccomend it to anyone especially those in SEA or Asia in general , the base player is really low so it take u a lot of time to find a lobby with decent ping , or a lobby in general , the game froze sometime and it pissed me off , there is no reward for ranking up and u will just get more laggy , less lobby and the same killer over and over
i have been wanting to buy this game for a while now. i finally decided to get the game and every DLC spent around 80 bucks or so. i was super excited until i joined the matches. i got farmed by other survivors for 5 games in a row and i then decide if this is going to happen every game then i will not give my money or time to this. i still love this game and watching youtubers play it but its not for me.
One of the worst killer-favored games I have ever played, glitchy, and they don't update jack in this game. You'd have a lot more fun playing Friday the 13th. If you don't believe me watch any youtube video of this game to see how they favored every killer and made survivor perks practically useless. F this game
