[h1]My Impression[/h1]
It's hard to write a proper review for this ever-changing, continually evolving game, but at its heart, it will always remain [i]Space Ninjas with Magic[/i]... and weapons... tons of weapons.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Warframe easily has enough content to fill up the [i]space[/i] of steam reviews..., but let's make it short here:

[h1]The Guide[/h1]
Soo, due to the steam restriction on the character limit for reviews, I will be putting the following points into a Guide:
[list]
[*] Free to play - why this game has a great monetization model and you don't have to worry about being ripped off.
[*]The Story - yes this game has a story, one which will entertain you for quite some time, combined with all the 'character quests'
[*]The Star Chart - or The World of this game and what to expect of it
[*]The Factions - and the characters which inhibit this galaxy
[*]The Gameplay - which is obviously the most important part here and reasons you will sink hours on hours of your life into this game
[*]The Visuals - the beauty this work of art is
[*]The Sound - and how far you can take it
[/list]
If that is too much reading for you, go ahead and finish this off with my personal verdict and then form your own opinion.

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
If you get through the harsh beginning, where you will lack a guiding hand this game will suck you in.
Once the game catches you into its flow of daily activities like the login reward and the sorties - 3 mission endgame action - and keeps you there with hourly temptations like alerts and new void rifts, you will become lost in space and time will just fly by.
Warframe is not without flaws, but it is steadily being worked on and being improved, the devs neither lack creativity nor daring, to try new things.
Although it's easy to forget - this game doesn't cost you any cash, so just give it some time and see what it can give you back.

[h1]Note[/h1]
If you have read this far - [b]thank you[/b].
I hope this review helped you in deciding to give this game a try and if you like it, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.
If you're here at the crossroads asking yourself "Destiny 2 or Warframe?" - then perhaps this review might clear a few things up for you!

To start with I have around 190 hours at the time of writing review and I approximately started playing Warframe around 3 weeks ago. I initially was looking for a game to keep me occupied whilst waiting for the Destiny 2 PC release.

Now I played Destiny 1 non-stop, I mean I grinded that game so hard for 4 months, achieved absolutely everything possible, obtained everything and then never touched it again. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED those 4 months. But this isn't a review about Destiny, but rather about Warframe... And man is it a good game!

Warframe at times can feel a bit overwhelming, there certainly isn't  the type of hand-holding that Bungie provide you with in Destiny. Whilst this hand holding can seem helpful at the start, it soon turns into a glass ceiling. Forcing you to go in a particular direction or playstyle - there is non of this in Warframe. 

In Warframe the universe is an open book and you approach it however you would like. There is a general linear progression to the missions, you unlock one planet move onto a next and so on, but warframe really lets you choose how you tackle this. The weapon system in Warframe is a prime example of how open it is: You can pick a starter gun, and because of 100's of mods available, this starter weapon can still kick a** in mid to end game! Every Primary, secondary and melee weapon feels unique and there are so many ways to alter these weapons: Want a machine gun that sets enemies alight? No problem, just add a Fire Mod! Want a bow that fires 2 arrows instead of 1? No problem, add a multi-shot mod! Want both of those? No problem, add both mods!

That's just the weapons, wait till you try the warframes! There are about 30 or so different warframes (basically characters) and each has 4 unique abilities. Each warframe is suited to a particular purpose: You like to control the sea and summon a Kraken to throw enemies about? Hydroid's your guy! You like to set every enemy on fire and watch the world burn? Ember's who you're after! Want to heal the rest of your teammates and be the lifeline of the team? Trinity is here! And guess what? Yepp, you can mod these just like you mod the weapons: Want more shield on your tanky Rhino warframe? No problem, we got that! Want more energy to keep using your abilities? Eyyy yepp that too! And that's just 2 examples out of hundreds!

Companions I heard you say? Oh yeah well in Destiny you have a futuristic rubix cube who attempts to make jokes. Whilst in Warframe you have about 6 different companions, 4 war wolves, some cat/fox breed and an epic looking alien bull! All of which have their unique abilities and purpose... And yes you guessed it: You can also mod them!

Next is customisation... Now wow oh wow is this impressive. Warframe lets you customise pretty much about everything. On a warframe you can add skins, you can add armor pieces, you can add sigils (tattoo type things), you can add capes, you can change helmet style and you can change the colour of every single one of these pieces and aspects. The same goes for your companions and weapons. Also you can customise the colour and skin of your ship, you can even change the colour of the walls inside your ship! There's ALOT to customise in this game, it's quite impressive.

Now at this stage you're probably saying: "Yeah well I heard you gotta buy in-game currency to get access to this awesome stuff." Incorrect! Warframe has a whole in-game market/trading system that often fuels the crafting system. Meaning that you can sell the drops you get from certain missions to other players for the in-game currency. Or you can keep it for yourself and once you've got all the bits you can craft it! Either way you will eventually earn platinum and be able to buy the epic stuff you wanted.

Lastly, the community. This is perhaps one of the nicest and most pleasant social aspects of Warframe. The community is so close, kind and caring. People have always helped me and some even gave me free stuff! This really is unique in an online game and boy is it nice to see.

All in all, I came to Warframe to keep me occupied and now I'm hooked. I STRONGLY recommend you try Warframe, you will not be disappointed. Great work DE!


* EDIT 1: Thank you all for your thumbs up, feedback and comments! I'll do my best to answer a few valid points that I've seen come up in the past week or in the comments.

1) "Certain Warframes are OP" - Well Yes and No, I don't think the term over-powered can be used here. I think certain Warframes are more USEFUL than others, but then again that will entirely depend on what mission or purpose you are doing. For example: Sure I can run through a difficult Spy mission with Ember (an incredibly offensive fire based Warframe) but I will have an easier and smoother time tackling it with Ash (a stealthy, silent, single target based Warframe).

It's also important to remember that a Warframe, weapon or even companion is only as powerful as the mods you put on it. Meaning that you can completely transform a warframe from something "meh" to something godly just by using the right mods, and good ones too! But remember, the better the mods, the harder they are to find / more expensive they are to buy with plat!

2) "The graphics are horrible" - I'm going to use World of Warcraft to demonstrate my point here (I'm sure there are many other examples, but WoW is the one I can think of right now!): - World of Warcraft is a long-running game and like in Warframe, the often beginner areas (which were created right at the start of the game) look barren and terrible. This is somewhat true about the first few planets in Warframe, certain areas at the start look lifeless and without depth BUT as you progress, the planets become more detailed and graphically nicer.

Furthermore, recently DE just remastered Earth (the first planet) and it looks MUCH nicer! So be patient, DE definitely know that certain areas look crud and they are working on it I'm sure! I expect more planets will get a make-over just like Earth in the near future.

3) "Plains of Eidolon is boring and filled with bugs " - Okay sure, Plains of Eidolon (the newest, semi-open world area) is not entirely what we expected but think of this: This is the first time DE have attempted anything like it, they clearly said prior to the release that they were expecting feedback and will continue to add more content to PoE. They are a small studio and don't necessarily have the resources that large studios like Blizzard or Activision might have. Give them time, give them feedback and be patient. I am almost certain that in the coming weeks DE will be adding more content and tweaking the existing stuff to make it smooth and enjoyable.

Also, Plains of Eidolon is not meant to be the bulk of the game, there are still many other planets and things to do! It's just a new area in an existing planet. Everyone chill and give DE some room to breathe and work things out, they have in the past and they will do so now too.



Thanks again all!
This story requires a bit of setup.

Last year, a friend of mine whom I'd known from gaming for a long time contacted me and told me about this great new game that was in beta that he was backing as a founder (called a "Grandmaster" in-game) called Warframe. A third person cooperative shooter with elements of Phantasy Star Online/Diablo loot runs, procedurally generated levels, and more content being added all the time. The game was difficult to start, as there are many keys for various secret parkour maneuvers. Running along walls! Sliding down ziplines! Soon, I was completely hooked; my friend and I were playing late into the night, trying to grind out just one more piece necessary to build a new component or weapon, or trying to beat our best time on the Survival missions -- where you fend off an ever growing wave of foes as life support ticks down. Over the year, there were many great victories, hair raising last second escapes, and new friends joining our little group. Many hours were spent joking around with each other on Skype, cracking jokes, blasting weird songs at each other, and coming up with our own stupid little catchphrases.

Flash forward a year; Warframe now has space combat, new Warframes, new weapons, and new combat controls. The game still has its original style, but it's so much improved. Last week, our four player regular team developed some incredible strategies that let us get further than we ever had on wave defense missions. The only thing that made us stop was getting tired.

On Tuesday, my friend who invited me to the game a year ago didn't show up that night. I found out on Wednesday that he had passed away suddenly from an undiagnosed health condition. The shock of it is still hitting us hard. The friendships that we had formed through the game, gone in an instant. It hardly feels real. I keep expecting him to log in and be there, ready to do another defense mission, and it's difficult to accept that we'll be going it alone now.

We contacted Digital Extremes, the company that makes the game, and asked if there was anything we could do. They dedicated their 11/20/2014 episode of their webcast to the memory of our friend and read our memorials to him on the air. Their reactions were heartfelt and touching. They really do listen to and react to the community.

I not only recommend the game for how much fun it is (I recommend you play it with a group of friends on voice chat -- up to four per session; your gameplay experience may vary alone, and form a clan or join one just because many items are clan-only), I recommend it for how responsive the game developers are to the community. They constantly improve it and add new content, items, and weapons. There is a storyline that is unfolding. The voice acting is delightful. You could easily play this game without spending a single dollar of real world currency on it (real world currency is used for cosmetics and increasing the number of Warframes and weapons you can own, or buying things that you can't wait for).

Thanks, Digital Extremes. And rest in peace, Woxit.
There are very few games that have held my attention for 1,000+ hours over the years, this is one of them. I created an account back when the game was still in Alpha (late 2012), back then it was was just a simple module with some enemies to kill with a handful of warframes to choose from. Even then though it showed promise. Over time they have added tons of content, new warframes, weapons galore, new planets, mission types, Archwing (fly in space!), events, clan dojos and foundry, player to player trading system, syndicates to join, player HUBs (relay stations), PVP, 8 player Raid etc etc. If you enjoy third person shooters, 4 player coop, pvp, raiding, RPG's and/or ninjas in space (lol) this game is a dream come true then for you. Being that it is free to play there is literally nothing to lose checking it out. 

The game is a constant work in progress and the developer Digital Extremes (DE) is constantly tweaking and adding new content all the time. Warframe has a very decent crafting system and you will most likely find yourself trying many different warframes/weapons combinations to see which one(s) fit your style the best. Believe me the game encourages you to do so, it is surprising the amount of variety in the game. When you find something you like it is a rewarding feeling and you will too it is just a matter of time. Also decent customization for your warframes, weapons, Sentinels (companion), Kubrows (dog companion), Liset (your ship), with a multitude of color choices, skins and attachments.

Every Warframe has its own set of individual abilities, they all have a total of 4. Some are better at being tanky, dps, sneaking (cloaking), solo play, healers, AOE damage, defense etc. There is a Warframe for every situation it seems. You can also make your own builds for each frame based on what mods you have (you attain them while playing missions they are dropped by enemies) For example "Continuity" mod allows for longer power duration time, when you ability is activated. More ammo, damage mods etc etc sooooo many. Making building your perfect Warframe/weapons very flexible and enjoyable. You have the opportunity to have a Primary, secondary and melee weapon. With the opportunity to make your own builds for everything here adds to the games replayability imo. Same goes for sentinels and kubrow companions they all have their own set of mods, especially made for them.

That being said the game can be very grindy, especially for newer players. That is to be expected though being that it is an MMOish experience. Especially to gather enough resources and credits to craft your items. Well worth it though if you have the time to invest. Sometimes they seem to nerf warframes and weapons for no reason at all and then they rework it again and "fix" it. Nerf/Un-nerf is the nature of free to play MMO' ish kind of games. (Constant "balance" tweaking) This is not an instant gratification game either, the game gets better the more you play it. You can also purchase items with real money from the in game market, it is [b]NOT[/b] necessary though. Most things can be attained just playing the game gathering resources and crafting them accordingly. Except, of course vanity items, skins, unique color palettes and limited time only items that have been available over the course of the game. 

DE sometimes gifts players new color palettes and send them to your inbox (valentine's day, halloween, St. Patrick's day etc.) Free weapons too, they seem to do somethings special on the games anniversary every year. The developer also listens to community feedback and designs and have added many things based on that. Which is always a plus. The game can also get repetitive at times, but with the amount of content in game now that is harder to happen. You just have to mix it up from time to time and try new things within the game. 

All in all the future looks bright for this game. A Developer that actually listens to community feedback. Constant updates/hotfixes. Plus there is so much new content coming soon! Game is not perfect of course, but what game truly is right. There is a lot to enjoy here and unique setting and premise to the game, definitely sets itself apart from the competition.

MMO's are hard to review, but at its current state I give this game a 4 stars ( ★ ★ ★ ★ ) out of 5
First, good things about Warframe:

This game has spoiled me. I will no longer accept anything less than this from any game developer. Be it AAA or indie.

This game is free. Get it? Free. You are not required to spend a single penny in order to experience the full content of the game. All characters, quests and environments are fully disclosed to you on their due time. That being said, I HAVE spent money on this. Why? Cosmetics of course. Fashion is endgame you know?

Now, just what is Warframe? Warframe is a mostly PVE third person shooter action game with parkour elements flawlessly integrated into the gameplay. You have seen games do parkour before of course, but these are space ninjas we're talking about, which means you can basically fly around the stage at high speed while letting loose a torrent of bullets, rockets and/or high-energy plasma, or just take out your trusty sword/hammer/fists and cripple anything in your path.

What will you face? Humanoids, robots, aliens, you name it. Yes, there are bosses, and they can and will kick your butt.
What will you face them with? Hundreds, and I mean HUNDREDS of weapons to choose from. Each of them unique in its own way, and deeply customizable to suit your needs and/or taste. You can carry three of them at a time. A primary weapon (bow, rifle, etc), a secondary weapon (pistol, throwing knives, and... other things), and of course a melee weapon.

Now, you can always tear through the game solo, but, for the best experience, the game pairs you with up to three other players in missions ranging from a stealthy rescue in the overgrown jungles of Earth, to an all-out extermination in the frozen wastelands of Pluto.
But doing missions is just one part of it, you also have a widely explorable open-world area, with its own assortment of missions waiting for you. And this open-world thing is only going get bigger in future updates. Oh and the updates, they are a regular thing. Like, every other day.

Now what's the story? Can't tell you. Its a secret. No, really, the game community is super protective of the game lore. There is a certain point in the game where you will KNOW, and then we can talk about it, but until then, you gotta find out for yourself. For now just consider yourself a space ninja.

How about difficulty? Scales up with your level, just like most modern mmos. The game will be just as hard as you want to handle. If you want to go at it casually, there's content for you. If you're looking for a challenge, good news, the enemy level can scale up almost infinitely.

------------------------------------
Now, bad things about warframe:

-PVP sucks
-Grinding, lots of grinding.
-There are some cool aspects of the game that are seemingly abandoned and/or have been in development hell for ages.
-Your inventory slots are limited, and you can buy more by using the premium currency. While technically you do not need to buy more slots, since you can simply sell what you don't need or want, it is a huge temptation and it is the most likely reason why you will buy platinum, if you ever do.

------------------------------------
About grinding. This is both a good and bad thing about the game. Most will consider grinding a bad thing but here it's a little diferent. In Warframe, the grind is integratd into the core objective of the game. Grinding is what you do to pass the time. It is so integrated into the game world that you don't really notice it. So yeah, there is a lot of grinding, but you have fun while doing it.
------------------------------------

Final thoughts.

Now, I'm not saying warframe should be game of the year or anything (more like game of the decade), but the level of attention and communication that Digital Extremes (the game devs) has with the warframe community and the display of love for their own game is absolutely marvelous. These people are setting a new standard for the gaming industry, and I can only see good things in the future for them.

In conclusion, we don't deserve Warframe.

Also, you can have a space dog/cat, and PET THEM. 10/10

*EDIT: Grammar*
Seeing as Tennocon just happened a few days ago, and has been gathering a lot interests since then, i think it would be a good idea to finally make a review on this thing. I mean i have like, what, [b]1500 hours[/b] on this game, so i think i qualified to talk about this game.

[h1]What is this game even[/h1]
Warframe is a third person PvE loot shooter, where its about collecting resources and items to craft new guns and armor so you can kill things in more ways. You play as a "Warframe", which are basically space ninjas. Each Warframe comes with a set of abilities to make them all special, and their mobility allows them to get across the stages with ease, and will become second nature before you know it.

[h1]Whats the bloody goal of the game[/h1]
Unlike most games, Warframe doesn't have a traditional progression system. All weapons and Warframes can only reach level 30, which you can easily get in a hour or two. However, your total rank (known as mastery rank) only ranks up when you level up new gear, and some items are locked behind a mastery rank. This means that it doesn't take long for new players to reach the highest level with their gear, with encouraging them to try new things as they play the game.

[h1]So hows the customization[/h1]
This is one of warframes strongest points. Pretty much all weapons and Warframe can be modded in any way you like. Wanna make your Warframe super tanky? Or maybe give his abilities alot of power for better damage? Thats all up to you. This makes the game extremely replayable, as you can experiment with different builds for your gear.
You can also change the look of your items for [b]maximum fashion,[/b] even as a new people.

[h1]It's free to play, meaning it has microtransactions...[/h1]
Lucky, warframe is one of the very best when it comes to this, Almost all items can be bought from the games shop, but they cost alot compared to how easy some of them are. Its as if the game says: "Look, i get it, you dont wanna work to get that shotgun, but its gonna cost you quite a bit to buy it.." The main you will be buying is instead things like weapon slots, warframe slots, boosters, accessories and so on. Theres also a trading system in the game, and it allows you to trade using the game's premium currency, giving the game its own economy.


[h1]Alright, that's good and all, but what are the cons[/h1]
Even tho i just said the game is "extremely replayable", this is still a loot shooter, meaning there will be grinding at times. Sometimes its not so bad, other times it goes a [b]bit[/b] beyone extreme. If games with grinding doesn't suit you at all, maybe you wanna skip this one. But hey, i've over 1000 hours on the game, and im still able to enjoy the game most of the time.

[h1]Ze End[/h1]
So thats my short review of the game. I dont wanna go much more into details since i feel like new players should see it for themself, but this is a basic overview of what kind of game it is, and what you can expect from it. If you like what you hear, then give it a try, its free after all. Now if you will excuse me, i have some [u]Prime items[/u] i need to get.
Loged-in for 5 minutes, woke up with 5k hours... 
Initially played this game for butts, eventually all primed items started popping-up in my inventory.
Warframe is a bit of a mixed bag for me. I've had moments were I really loved it and there have been numerous moments where I've wanted to smash my desk with a sledgehammer. 
I'll just write a short and simple review.

Combat - 8/10
Really satisfying and fast. But the late game can get stressful and too hectic.

Movement - 7/10
Mostly same as above, but what brings it down a bit is the numerous enemies that kill your momentum and the Co-op elements.

Multiplayer - 5/10
Great in the beginning but it really gets dragged down in the higher levels where all players just speed around the map to the objectives and it starts to feel more like a speedrun. I always found it annoying when people would just race past enemies and do all these exploits just to get through the level faster and I would struggle to keep up.

Story - ?/10
I don't have much to say since the story is unfinished, but the little that I've seen thus far is pretty interesting.

Visuals - 8,5/10
Absolutely stunning. The lighting really makes the game. It's so bright and vivid, and it runs great I might add. And I really like the designs for all the different warframes and cosmetics.

Missions and objectives- 5/10
This is sadly the weakest point of the game. The missions and levels get really repetetive and grindy. And trying to get new gear can sometimes take weeks. (Including build times) This is the part where you're really reminded that this is a F2P game. I would've prefered to pay for a full game with less of a grind since I've already spent way more than 60$ on rushing items and buying cosmetics. I'll add that I'm not a fan of grinding (which is why I've spent so much money on the game.), I know some people are and kudos to you if you're into that stuff but I'm not.


Keep in mind that these are my personal opinions and experiences. Correct me on anything that's wrong and feel free to share your thoughts with me.

*Changed "Overall gameplay" to "Missions and objectives"
*Changed 3/10 to 5/10 and on the since some people thought it was too low and I agree
[h1]Player(s)[/h1]
[  ] Singleplayer
[X] Multiplayer
[  ] open world

Most missions can be played with up to 3 other players online. There are singleplayer sections as well as some open world areas, but most of the game is for 1-4 players.

[h1]Story[/h1]
[  ] has no story
[  ] not interesting/important
[  ] decent story
[X] good story
[  ] emotional rollercoaster

The game starts out with hardly any story, but gets better the more you get into it and the more you read item descriptions and little details. After that you have a pretty good story in many aspects.

[h1]Long term motivation / play time[/h1]
[  ] very short (<5h)
[  ] relatively short (5-10h)
[  ] decent length (10-20h)
[  ] long (20-50h)
[  ] very long (50-100h)
[X] endless (>100h)

So many different things to do and farm, you can spend thousands of hours if you want to

[h1]Difficulty[/h1]
[  ] very easy
[X] doable for everybody
[  ] might be somehow challenging
[  ] very hard
[  ] Dark Souls hard

Not that challenging, you just need to dedicate time

[h1]Controls[/h1]
[  ] few buttons
[X] average amount of buttons
[  ] might need some time to get used to
[  ] wait... which button again?

Besides your movement keys you just have to shoot and use 4 abilities. You need to memorize everything to be fast, but it's nothing particularly difficult.

[h1]Time investment / Grind[/h1]
[  ] relies purely on skill
[  ] need to invest some time, but skill will help
[  ] a lot of grinding
[X] lock yourself up in the basement

you better get ready for some long a** grinding

[h1]Diversity[/h1]
[  ] same thing over and over again
[X] sometimes a little monotonous
[  ] a lot of different levels
[  ] Surprise Motherf***er!

You have a lot of different planets and random generated maps for every mission, but the basic gameplay stays the same.

[h1]Characters customization[/h1]
[  ] none
[  ] few possible changes
[  ] a lot of ways to upgrade your character
[X] essential for the game

Basically everything you do comes down to leveling, designing, modifying your character.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
[  ] complete garbage
[  ] very bad
[  ] okay
[  ] looks nice sometimes
[X] good graphics but nothing special
[  ] visually stunning

[h1]Music / Soundtrack[/h1]
[  ] none
[  ] my ears are bleeding...
[  ] I'll just listen to my own music
[X] can be quite nice
[  ] absolutely beautiful

Definitely hase some good soundtrack that is worth listening to

[h1]Atmosphere[/h1]
[  ] shitey
[  ] yeah, looks good
[X] stunning

The game creates a very good atmosphere especially due to its variety of planets and locations. You really feel like you are part of that universe (well you actually are) and many places like the moon (called Lua in game) or the Void look just super gorgeous.

[h1]In game purchases[/h1]
[  ] pay 2 win
[X] pay 2 skip (everything can be acquired by just playing the game)
[  ] no real money can be spend

You can spend soooo much money, but at the same time everything can be completed by playing the game. As I said before, this game has a lot of grinding, which can be skipped by paying, but it's not p2w.

[h1]Personal thoughts:[/h1]
This game is definitely not for everybody, if you don't like spending a lot of time, grinding and doing some things multiple times, this game is nothing for you. But if you do like those things, this game is excellent. Especially the movement is just so addicting and you have so many different weapons/warframes/companions/planets/gamemodes.
If you're not sure whether to get it or not, just try it out, especially since it's free. Have fun!

[h1] TL;DR [/h1]
For being free, [b]this game is completely worth what you get[/b]. [b]You have agility[/b] beyond belief which allows for [b]more than a 'CoD like shooter'[/b], and [b]extensive modding which doesn't "dumb down" the player[/b] at all. Quite literally [b]billions of mod combinations[/b]! This game has a [b]fluidity which doesn't allow for a review to do it justice[/b]. What does that mean? Well, the nearly monthly, [b]FREE updates[/b], can completely change this game. With the Plains of Eidolon just on the horizon, this game will go from mission based to open world. This is the sort of game that [b]gets updates which seem like Warframe 2[/b]. Imagine Destiny, but Destiny 2 was a free update. [b]It's a great game, honestly[/b]. Not P2W at all, and is SO generous you'll probably spend money just to donate to DE! I highly recommend this game. Why not try it? [b]It's free![/b]

[h1] Intro [/h1]
Warframe, a universe thriving with lush, hidden lore. The place where a species of technologically crude, and industrious Grineer have made home. The place where a plutocratic, advanced, and money greedy Corpus have made home. The place where a technocyte plague known as the Infestation has made home. Ah, and of course.. the place where you, the noble, honorable, Tenno; have made home. 

[h1] Warframe Pros [/h1]

Warframe is a free to play done right, everything in this game can be earned for completely free. You know how I know? Well, I've been getting EVERYTHING for free, and have spent a fair amount of hours to get this info!

This game has thousands of mods. Unlike its 'comparable' Destiny, this game has more than a dumbed down skill tree. This game has a modding system. One which lets your power have billions of stat combos.

This game allows for player to player trading. Whether you're looking for 'prime' gear, or platinum (premium currency), trading has you covered. There are people willing to trade you for mods, gear, and platinum.

The UPDATES, now this is a big one. This game Warframe has had so many updates, nearly on a monthly basis that it could EASILY have had a Warframe 2 by now. For a game being completely free, these updates are WELL worth your time. I mean hell, for the first time, we're getting an enormous expansion adding open worlds! (which we all know will be expanded to every planet).

The memorable moments. One, undeniable fact, is that this game gets sweeter as time goes on. With monumental quests such as The Second Dream and The War Within, this game will blow you out of your socks. Though, for some, this can take up to 100-200 hours to get to. It's crazy, but gives you the best feeling and memory afterwards.

Your Space Mom. Every Tenno needs to feel like they have someone.. SOMEONE! For the longest time, in the game, I was closest to my dear space mom. The Lotus!

The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous, I know this is a random one but it can really hit you in the feels later on. Try looking up "This is What You Are - Keith" <- It'll bring you to a Warframe song that is too good..

[h1] Warframe Cons [/h1]

The grind can be unrelenting for some. For people like me, the grind was never bad because of my constant progression, but for people who aren't patient or want things quickly (in a progression system) this might be a bit too much.

The lore is very hidden. There is a story, but for some major lore, and theories on it, you'll have to look it up on YouTube. If you'd like a good series I recommend StallorD

The enemy scaling. For some people who love a hard challenge, the enemy scaling might be too much. Not exactly the ENEMY itself, but more specifically the ARMOUR on an enemy. It can be insane to even damage an enemy after level 100.  

[h1] Improvements? [/h1]
[i] These are simply opinions on minor things... [/i]

Dojo improvements. I think Tennogen should be introduced for the Dojo, more decorations should be added, AND massive group builds. I'm talking about decorations that require a load of resources. That way if you have a large and active clan, you'll have special things that show your true power, and riches!

On 'Finisher' animations for the Nikana backslash, a mark/bodysplit hould happen. What I mean is that you do a diagonal slash across the enemies back, yet no deep cut appears, or body splitting? I dunno, just a request!

Please add a flashlight we can toggle. Especially with the release of PoE, seeing in the dark is crucial. Either an option to turn on and off the flashlight manually or nightvision would be greatly appreciated. I don't know about anyone else but seeing in the dark hurts my eyes sometimes, oopsie!

[h1] Final Words [/h1]

Now please, note that this is all speculation and pure opinions! I love Warframe! If you have any questions, need help in game, a clan to join, or notice anything spelled wrong, or anything I should add.. please feel free to drop a comment in the space below!

Vote for this game under "Labor of Love!"
It's the game where i met most of my friends and its hard to meet toxic players because its mainly PvE. Overall the devs are extremely generous and for the most part listen to the community also.. RED TEXT!
upd8: please look at the first two comments for more things I reviewed! comments contain spoilers!

this game tends to be one of two things for most people: either you love it & sink countless hours (and maybe dollars) into it, or you pick it up for a couple hours & put it back down.

this doesn't need saying, but I fall into the former category.

Warframe is a masterfully done game that offers its players a lot of choices not just for what they want to do, but also how they want to do it. you can spend your days designing rooms and outfits. you can sneak through puzzles trying not to get caught, or slash through wave after wave of enemies where your only objective is don't die. you can play as a swordsman, or a magnet, or a golem, or a dj, or something else out of the 30+ warframes they have available (each with their own unique kit of abilities).

pve has never felt this satisfying and engaging. the game has a good balance of quick "get in get out" missions, as well as endless missions with rotating rewards (this way you get incentive to stay, but also you don't feel bad for leaving). the sound design team deserves a medal, because this game is the only fps I've played that makes me feel satisfied through sound, not just rewards.

speaking of design, the world is incredibly interesting, & so are all the factions living in it. each has its own unique visual style & moral code, we're not seeing reskinned enemies going "I wanna destroy the tenno cause reasons!" or reskinned npcs going "help me obi-wan kenobi, you're my only hope!" over and over again. but that doesn't mean they're disconnected; we're constantly seeing people from different factions talking to each other & mentioning each other in passing. the connectedness of the people living in this world is a level of realism I'm not accustomed to in games that aren't 100% story driven, & it makes me appreciate the level of detail the devs use for this game.

that's not to say Warframe doesn't have a story. it's not always easy to find, & at times very frustrating to work through, but it's there and it's interesting and strange. (fwiw, a LOT of the story is told/enhanced through environmental storytelling. you're going to want to hunt for kurias, cephalon fragments, & synthesis targets. or consult the wiki!) the most I can say without spoiling things: you're caught in the middle of factions trying to fight each other, & they either want you with them or they want you dead.

Warframe is optimized to hell and back, to the point where I suspect it could run (poorly) on an apple watch. this optimization HAS gone down in recent months (they recently said that they're no longer supporting 32 bit machines and OS's before Windows 7), but that's still a lot of ground they cover. I was able to play Warframe with little to no issues on a laptop with a terrible graphics card (seriously it couldn't handle Skyrim with the lowest settings). this is an incredible achievement, especially when you consider the details and particle effects the game contains.

also you can get dogs, cats, & pet robots. petting your animals is a game mechanic that gives them buffs. you can fly around in space. you have dance emotes. you can get capes & jet packs & bobbleheads & action figures. you're a robot ninja in space! and all of this is free!

now I've spent a lot of this waxing poetic about how great Warframe is, but this game isn't without its faults. you should know what you're getting into if/when you get this game.

if you're strictly free-to-play, this game is a huge grind. gaining platinum (the paid currency that allows you to get cosmetics, progress boosters, weapon/warframe slots, and weapons/warframes if you don't feel like building them) is best done by getting things called prime parts, which are random drops from relics. you can trade these prime parts to other players for platinum (there are other things you can trade, but prime parts are basically the only things that'll get you any platinum). I wouldn't go so far as to say that rewards in this game resemble a loot box system (the devs have removed systems in the game that act as slot machines), but that doesn't mean it's without frustrations. basically, if you don't want to give Digital Extremes your money for platinum: you have to grind a lot of missions to get prime parts, which you can trade for platinum, which then makes grinding less frustrating. life's rough if you don't have money to spare.

it's also frustrating when you want to get That One Thing you need, but it's the rarest thing on a drop table. again, I cannot stress enough how much I appreciate the devs going out of their way to eliminate loot box/slot machine systems from this game! but often you're stuck with either 1) deciding if you want to take a shortcut by spending platinum, or 2) not having any shortcuts to take so you just keep grinding and grinding. (one time I asked someone if they played Warframe, & they said "if I wanted to grind I'd go to a club.")

the story doesn't get engaging until Natah. Natah is a quest which you can't access until you can do missions on Uranus, which is also the planet where enemies suddenly get a LOT harder. this point is basically where the game is like "we're not holding your hand anymore, you need to start upgrading your weapons/warframes." (funny enough, upgrading your stuff ALSO involves unskippable grinding, but this time it's less rewarding!) Natah has been out since 2015, and by now it's what brings new players into the game (along with the quests that come after it). trouble is, new players are going to want to rush to get to these quests. and by rushing, without taking the time to upgrade their stuff by painstakingly grinding it to rank 30 over and over again, they're going to suffer and get frustrated. this game needs to do more story-wise to not just capture new players' attentions, but to also keep them. (seriously, when I played The Second Dream for the first time, I had to take a long break from Warframe. I was rank 6-7, I was constantly overwhelmed, & I was too busy trying to stay alive to actually pay attention to the story. it sucked.)

DE enables this by making Natah available to people who are as low as rank 3. that's not to say I have a problem with newbies playing the main story! my problem is with DE making it available, but also making the level scaling completely inaccessable. if you're going to make this quest available to people as low as rank 3, you need to make it so that they can actually succeed at it. otherwise what's the point?

not all the quests in your codex are repeatable. so far only the ones that are directly tied to the main storyline can be repeated, & even then it feels really random. I can replay the quest that introduces me to the infested faction way at the beginning of the game... but I can't replay Natah? the quest that basically starts the whole mess of events that we're going through? come on!

speaking of, & this is really important: most of the quests that give you warframes as rewards are NOT repeatable (& I believe you can't get Octavia's blueprint again if you've already done Octavia's Anthem). if you end up selling a warframe that you got through a quest, as of right now the only way to get it again would be to buy it in the marketplace for platinum.

now this IS a free to play game, more often than not. so maybe these things won't bother you. that's totally fine, it's just something you should keep in mind if you ever feel like spending money on this game. (which isn't something I'm against, ftr; Digital Extremes is one of the few dev teams out there which I can safely say respects their players and makes sure their game is fun and not just a way to make money.)

ultimately, I recommend trying it, especially if you can get some other friends to join you. you're gonna have a good time! and if you ever get stuck, there's a lot of people who can show you the ropes!
This game is good if you have:
- No money
- Lot's of spare time

This game is bad if you have:
- a job
- a Wife/girlfriend
- children
- bills
- church
- a mortgage loan
- another hobby
- any form of resposibility in your life
[h1] Not pay to win [/h1]
Before I start my review, I want to dispell this notion. Anyone who tells you this game is pay to win is wrong, or lying to you. Most of the good weapons are mastery rank locked and even if you buy things to bypass the grind, you still have to level those Warframes and weapons, you still have to play the game to grind and get mods for your weapons and Warframes to make them actually perform well in end-game content. You're blindsiding yourself if you're going to make the argument that this game is pay to win. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's get to the actual review.

[h1] Graphics [/h1]
I had to start off by reviewing the graphical quality of this game, because it's [i] so beautiful. [/i] Everything is well polished and good-looking, the appearance of Warframe will not hesitate to immerse you into the environment. On top of that, graphically the game is extremely well optimized compared to other games, and can run on many older computers without an issue. There is no section of the game that is forgotten about in regards to visuals. Clearly, a lot of love has been put into this game and you can tell that immediately just by looking at how beautiful and immersive the game is.

[h1] Gameplay [/h1]
Warframe's content and gameplay are some of the best for any free-to-play game out there. Everything in Warframe is available without paying if you are willing to grind for it. One of the best freemium models out there, seriously. You can earn Platinum, the premium currency, in-game without ever spending a cent on it. As for the Warframes themselves, each one is unique, and there are over 35 of them. 35! That's a lot of different characters to choose from. Each of them has 4 unique abilities that do different things, and you can typically mod a Warframe 3 different ways or more to focus on a specific part of their ability kit. That is a fantastic amount of customization and one of the things I love most about the game. I will say that the star chart content can get a bit repetitive at times, but if you stick it out, fill out your star chart, and get into high level content, it'll feel less repetitive in due time. At higher levels the combat gets much more complex. Try staying for at least an hour in a survival mission if you decide to play, and you'll see what I mean.

[h1] Cosmetics [/h1]
I had to talk about the cosmetics in Warframe because let's face it- fashion, looking good and uniqueness are important aspects of any videogame. Warframe has a ton of cosmetics, and they're all extremely beautiful and wonderful. Once you get through all the star chart content, you may find yourself grinding for Platinum to purchase a new set of clothes- or outright buying it with real money, I won't judge you for it. In fact, some of the best cosmetics in the game can only be purchased with real money- the TennoGen cosmetics are handsomely crafted with love by individual creators, and your money goes back to those creators, supporting them and allowing them to make more wonderful content for the game.

[h1] Grinding [/h1]
I'll flesh out my review by saying this. If you don't like grinding or MMO-type games, Warframe probably isn't for you. I would still give it a go even if you don't like those types of games, but you're probably not going to enjoy it if you aren't a patient person. Grinding is the name of the game in Warframe, and RNG affects many activities in the game. If you don't like the fact that you aren't guaranteed certain things and have to wait for warframes and weapons to finish building before you can use them, or that you have to farm resources to build them, then you probably won't enjoy the game. Still, if you invest your time into the grind, you can acquire nearly anything you want for no cost at all.

[h1] Updates [/h1]
One great thing about Warframe is that they are constantly updating the game and delivering new content to us. Year round, we get new Warframes, quests, and content, albeit they can be buggy at the start. We received Sanctuary Onslaught, a new gamemode, and The Sacrifice, a new quest, earlier this year, and we're getting Fortuna, an open-world area on Venus later this year. That's a lot of content for one year! While it's not always the best and most optimized content, I see more love poured into Warframe content than that of any other game at the current time. The devs maintain a strong relationship with the community and actively ask questions to the players about what they want to see and what they want changed, and do frequent livestreams for fun and for discussing where they are in terms of development with the game. Their strong community commitment is one of the great things that many people love about Warframe- DE's transparency and willingness to maintain a strong bond with us is something that not many other game companies can brag about.

[h1] Conclusion [/h1]
So, if you read my entire thing and some of my points sparked your interest, I would definitely reccommend giving the game a go. I have loved every second I've played of Warframe and I can honestly say it's one of the only games whose future updates I'm currently excited for. There are no downsides to trying the game out- after all, it's free to play and if you don't like the grind then you can stop at any time and uninstall the game. There's no paywalls or money barriers to any of the content in the game. It takes time to grind for resources and build things, but if you can develop patience, that grinding pays off, and the game will only get deeper and more complex as a result.
This game is evil.

At first, you will be astonished by the super cool graphics and character/weapon designs. You will say to yourself "How can this be free?" And for the first 20 or so hours, everything will seem fine. But then, all of a sudden, you will match up with someone who has a way cooler frame than you, and you will look in awe at them, and every cell in your body will tell you "You need to become that guy". But then after doing some research online, you will realise that his frame is no longer obtainable, so you have to trade with some dude, who has dedicated atleast 1000+ hours to this dark ritual of a game. So, gullible as you are, you will start to slowly farm rare items, to gain enough premium currency to be able to afford this "Frost Prime". Then, after 20-25 hours of grinding, you will start to question your own exsistence, as you have only garned about a third of the platinum you need to buy that goddamn warframe. And then, in your hour of darkness, the game will hit you with a 50% discount on the premium currency. And in this hour of darkness, where all your mental defenses have been stripped away from the countless hours of relic farming, you will succumb to the dark lords. But not only will you buy enough platinum to afford the warframe of your dreams, you will buy one of the most expensive bundles, As the dark lords, known only in the common tounge as Digital Extremes, had intended. Because who wants to save 5 bucks, when you can save 50?

You will powerfull for a time. You will feel as though nothing can stop you. Untill you run out of platinum, and the cycle begins anew. And thus in countinues for eternity.

10/10 Would feed my soul to the dark lords for flashy weapons again
Been playing for 5 years. Might be why I'm still single, but totally worth every second of Grineer grinding, Corpus chopping and Infested popping. My favourite game to date. Totally wrecks any Free-to-play model out there currently, and the Developers actually care about making the players happy with content and great improvements, not just the money.  11/10
[h1]Update (24/4/14):[/h1] It has been a fairly significant chunk of time since I wrote this review of Warframe, and some elements of the game have been expanded upon in ways that alleviate some of the issues I originally had. 

The premium currency, platinum, can now be traded between players. This provides an option for players who do not wish to put money into the game but want to participate in using the storefront. Users in the comments have pointed out that there are many powerful items which are not available in the store - if you want them, you'll need to grind.

Multiple new game modes exist, including "Invasion", a mode which allows players to team up together with the Corpus or the Grineer to work against the opposing faction. This mode gives the player some agency in the kinds of rewards he receives for completing the mission.

The latest update introduced Melee 2.0, which delivered improvements to the game's melee combat.

The most interesting update comes in the form of Dark Sectors. Clans and alliances can own parts of the Solar System, and can fight for that contested ownership. Clans and Alliances can also set tax and resource requirements on anyone who accesses their conquered territories, leading to territorial battles for supremacy.

In conclusion, a decent amount of content has been added to the game. While the core argument of my review holds true, Warframe is finally approaching the level of depth required to elevate itself above a mere grinding game. The new "EVE Online"-esque sector mechanics are particularly promising in that regard.

<hr>

[h1]Original Review (25/11/13)[/h1]

A great-looking, initially interesting game that feels like one compelling part of what should be a greater whole.

Warframe is an interesting entry in the free to play space. It has the looks and the gameplay, but after a while it begins to feel lacking in the way of substance. 

Gameplay largely involves clearing your way through various missions types as you progress in rank, leveling up your weapons and your Warframe (the game's metaphor for various Classes, each having their own unique abilities, advantages, disadvantages and so on) as you shoot a myriad of alien Grineer, infested hordes, and Corpus robots. Missions range from rescue scenarios where a hostage must be located and escorted to safety, to mobile defense missions where waves of increasingly difficult enemies must be held off as you protect a moving objective. These can all be completed solo, but are made more interesting by grouping up with other players. Higher level missions are tricky by yourself, making teaming up the more attractive proposition. 

Weapons and Warframes can be augmented with various modifcations that apply the standard Action RPG fare - elemental damage bonuses, increased critical hit damage, faster reload speeds, you name it. This allows for some diversity in gameplay between players, where you may opt to build out your Warframe in a more supportive role, or stock up on mods which provide a more tanky character.

So far the game has been well supported with semi-regular content updates and special events, usually in the form of new warframes and weapons, and a "community effort" in which everyone can participate.

The only "issue" is that the game is a bit of a grind. In fact, it's a complete grinding game. The main reason for going on missions is in the hopes of accumulating various materials with which to craft the new warframes or weapons. You can use the games "premium" currency to expedite the process of manufacturing said items (which take hours, days of real time to craft) or simply buy them outright from a storefront. Why do you want these new weapons and warframes? To grind more efficiently for materials. This might strike you as a monotonous loop, and to an extent it is, but the joy of the gameplay itself goes a way to allievating the game from being a total bore. Inevitably though you may become tired of the treadmill. 

The game sometimes feels like it is skirting the boundaries of being gross about its "free to play" nature - you can certainly get almost everything in the game without spending if you're willing to commit to the grind, but it can sometimes feel like game systems are designed to encourage you to give up and bring out your wallet - namely the sheer amount of materials required to craft better equipment, and the time spent waiting for these items to actually be built. It's always questionable when a F2P game includes a long timer alongside a button to make it go away for just a few pounds.

Ultimately, if you're just looking for a good looking, nice playing third person shooter with online components and a decent aesthetic, you can do far worse than Warframe. After spending some time with it, however, you might wind up wishing there was a little more to the experience beyond what is currently available.
The best 500 hours I've ever spent. Would highly reccomend it. 

DE has done a fantastic job at taking a mediocre game and transforming it into a content giant with a great community and a satisfying game loop of farming resources and building weapons and new frames. I have met many good friends and made lots of memories in Warframe. And its FREE! Thank you DE for what you have done.

Now after I have gushed, I will be real.

This game is not for everyone. If grindy games are not for you, I would reccomend you at least try Warframe, but if you get bored and leave I'd understand.

I think everyone should at least try this amazing game and experience its dedicated development team and community managers. I give Warframe a near perfect as far as games go. I would say an 8 out of 10 solely for the point that it is still semi-niche as a looter grindy game and that not everything is intuitive and has a decent learning curve.

Believe me though,

it's worth it.
I was holding back on writing a review, cause I can't really think of the perfect combination of Words to try and bring across how good this Game actually is. 

First of all this game is constantly being updated and looked after. DE (Digital Extreme) are amazing developers which listen to their Community. When I first started playing this Game a while back it was rather confusing and I did not enjoy it. I came back to it after I saw DEs Plans of Cetus, an open world area. Whilst Cetus wasn't actually out yet I found myself falling in Love with the current Game instead. There is endless things to do, whilst it does give you a great Story it also gives you other elements. 

It doesn't matter whether you play this game casually or advanced. You will have fun either way. It also is completely free and ever expanding. Whilst there is an option for microtransactions they are however not necessary and mainly just used for cosmetics. Such as Steam cosmetics. Anything that is in the Game you are able to get 100% Free if you are willing to learn the trading system which is alot easier with third party warframe.market (not bannable just a place to meet, you still trade ingame). 

There is just so much good things to say about this game and as I said before its always updating and they are adding new content all the time. I really fell in love with this game and its my absolute favourite.

I can only recommend this Game with all my heart.

If you first start playing this Game dont be afraid to read up some things on the wiki, allow the Game to teach you and be prepared to read up alot about its mechanics. I am 1000h in and I am still using the wiki for the best everything.

Be patient, be kind and be the tenno you want to meet!

[h1] Cons: [/h1]
[list]
[*] [b] Starting game can be sluggish and inconsistant in its learning curve. As some have described it before, it isn't new player friendly, as it lacks tutorials, or solid descriptions of what the game's features are and how to properly implement them in your gameplay [/b]
[*]Grindfest. You better get several drinks ready, because this will be a grind and a half
[*]RNG will not bless you this day
[*]Peer-to-peer system
[*]Servers can be tempermental

[*]Archwing has been more fleshed out, yet it still needs work: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/4w3kn6/archwing_missions_are_designed_in_exactly_the/
[/list]

[h1] Conclusion: [/h1]
Even though the beginning can feel sluggish, once you've completed the tutorial and played a few games, it can be addictive and moreish. The huge variety of weapons, mods, and warframes allows for multiple play styles, so if one style doesn't work for you, try another! All in all, I've played over 1000 hours, and plan to put in much more, because yes... I'm addicted, and you will be, too.

By looking how much time i have spent in this game, you can realise - this game, if it manages to hook you, will keep you for years.

Instead of bunch of words, i will just go straight to pros and cons.

Pros:
1) Weaponry. Basically, you can find lots of guns of your liking by just trying them or asking people of how they work and get an idea of how they act and how good\bad they are. Well, since there are around 350 weapons available for you to pick from, you will surely find a tool of death and destruction of your own playstyle: bows and crossbows, rocket\grenade launchers, flamethrowers, machineguns, shotguns, sniper rifles and even futuristic LAZ0R guns. Basically - primary weaponry includes two-handed guns of pure murder, secondary can be either Magnum spewing thingie or just a bullet wind of two machinegun pistols, and melee... From swords, katanas and throwble disks to spears, staffs and two handed maces\axes\swords (LOTS more melee types not mentioned but existent in the game).
2) Customising. Every weapon and warframe themselves can be upgraded in different ways, such as with card system, or Mods. Basically, you have a gun which you like a lot, but don't like fire rate or reload speed? Is a problem? Ofc no! There are several mods that allow you to drop reload times by seconds and increase your fire rate from few shots per second to a flippin' minigun (well, not literally, but difference will be serious to notice). Don't like the damage? At start, without mods, your gun can't even tear through lvl 5 enemy's armor? With mods installed, even lvl 30+ will drop like flies!
3) Warframes. Each one is it's own different class, but all of them follow several roles: offensive, defensive, CC support and healers. Since there are 35 warframes, not including their upgraded versions, you will find warframes for a role you like the most :D Not to mention - Warframes are upgradeable in the same way as weaponry, so you can be tought as balls of steel :D
4) Missions. There are lots of different game modes to play, including endless ones, which raise the difficulty level with each wave\round\cycle done, thus, increasing the challenge. Not to mention - every map is randomly generated from certain set of premade rooms, which may or may not contain secret rooms or places. Sure, it gets all the same after hours played, but sometimes, even at my hours, just stopping by and checking out rooms themselves will allow you to enjoy the view.
5) Pace of battles. Basically, it is almost run'n'gun style, but sometimes, when you meet tough foes, tactics comes in and game slows. Just barely. See a patrol of enemies? Slice through them with your melee, take them out with headshots or just kill them with your warframe's abilities and continue moving forward.
6) No actual goal. It may be cons for some people, but i like, that i can feel and play the game at my own speed, not being forced to do any particular chore. You pick your own goals in this game, you pick your own ways of achieving them and else and else - even doing missions is up to you: go sneaking in and silently take down enemies, or just go guns blazin' and leave a trace of scorched\ripped\frozen\corroded\sliced or just simply smashed bodies behind.
7) F2P. This is it, boys and girls. This game is true F2P game, since you already have your starting real-money currency to spend on stuff (which is not much, but helps a lot already). Real-money currency is not used to boost your own skills or, lets say, shine more than others. You can buy lots of weapons and frames with that currency, which is called Platinum, or how players call it - Plat or Plats. Bought a gun\frame? Gj, you saved yourself some time, but without mods and actuall training in the game with other stuff, it won't do really different from starter things. You can donate, you can NOT donate - yourr own choice, since Trading system allows you to trade rare (or not really rare...) things to player, which they are willing to get for plats they have. The only stuff which is not allowed to be achieved are Cosmetics, like: color pallettes, cosmetic armor pieces, syandanas (that clothy thingie around your neck or hanging on your back) and different color\visuals for your fav frames or guns.
8) Community in this game is great, people are willing to answer your questions, or give advices, sometimes even help with missions or farming. The only downside of this Community are toxic players, since they are everywhere, and scammers (yes, it is possible to scam you through trading), but besides them - lots of kind people, sometimes stuck doing their stuff or sometimes willing to help anyone who is in seek of help.
9) Trading. You can trade with players for items, such as - Mods, prime parts and blueprints, relics and all that. You can even trade for platinum, if you need\want\can :D
10) Quests. They were implemented not so much time ago, and they are in constant development. Right now there are 5 main story quests and a dozen of secondary quests, all of which give you pieces of story-wise puzzle + they are rewarding with items or frames which you can't get anywhere else.

Lets go to Cons, since i don't want to let you play unprepared:
1) Support. Yes, it is a problem. At first, few years back, it was helping and caring, since there wasn't much people around. Right now, support is there just to be... I got banned TWICE for same message, which wasn't profanity, insult or anything like that (chat-bots problems, not support), yet, contacting Support was unproductive both times (first time i was called the one, whos fault brought chat ban upon himself; other time they just said "Automatic bans are not liftable, but notices info you brought are made and bots will be fixed" without unban happening both times. Oh well). So, it is either you go to forums to seek for help from players, or just wait for problems to be fixed in next patches or bans being lifted automatically.
2) Grind. Yes, it exists. For me, materials are not a problem anymore, but for new players, it is gonna be tough, since some craftables need lots of rare materials, which have low drop chances and rates. Same goes for parts of upgraded (Prime) stuff dropping, so, be prepared to do same missions overand over to get what you want.
3) Enemy difficulty progression. Basically, each level just adds more armor, health and damage they deal, but since lvl 1 and to 30, new enemies will appear. After 30 - it will all be the same, except that enemies will have more armor, health and damage...
4) Trading... Yes, it is in Cons too. Trading will make you sit through Trading chat for hours, hoping to contact at least someone to trade with. More than that, you can be scammed for your plat - you don't get the item you wanted, but, yet, you still lose plats you have put in trading. Yes, it happens. I wouldn't say, that very often, but it happens.
5) Learning the game. Yes, it is in cons, since for new player, even when it became newbie-friendly with new Prologue and advices at loading screens, it is still as confusing as it can be - some objectives are not clear, some marks of goal (where to go) are broken and you are just lost and more and more.
6) Bugfixes. Some of the hotfixes break perfectly fine animations, perfectly working stuff and all that, leaving it rather not working or so broken, that it would be better left in the state of just not working. Yes, they keep fixing bugs, but it does not mean that ALL bugs will be caught and fixed (overall coding problems in the world, DE are affected too).
7) Balancing. Actions of Devs should not be judged and all that, but sometimes they make decisions out of nowhere without real consideration - it makes people aggro a lot and then they revert\rethink changes they did.

Overall - good game with constant developing, but support of it is not good, so, be carefull.
PROS
+ Movement is something else! It may begin to do a number on your pinky finger but once you get a hang of the moment controls, this is possibly the best platforming I've seen in a third-person shooter. High octane, to the point where sometimes I feel I'm getting motion sickness.
+ You can farm Prime parts to sell for Platinum, the "premium" currency, which means that, with some patience, you can actually get by in this game without spending a single penny of real-world money.
+ Most items have a ton of customization options ASIDE from the ability to recolor which you get from the very start without having a spend anything. Warframes? Recolorable! Weapons? Recolorable! Your own SPACESHIP?! YES! Recolor away! Pets, sadly, are a biiiiit harder to recolor, I think.
+ Very, VERY well-optimized. I play this game butter-smooth on my ages-old PC and wouldn't be surprised if it worked on my aging laptop.

CONS
- Very, very grindy. If you just craft a Warframe, it literally takes days (72 hours) before your frame is finished being made.
- You can... actually kinda follow the development as you progress through the game. Production value shoots up as you progress, showing that later content.Earth through Uranus feels very... "samey", where you're just progressing from node to node, junction to junction, and it will test your patience. Uranus/Neptune and above, though? You begin to actually get PROPER quests. With cinematics and everything. However, the game takes too long getting here... I feel that's why they plopped Cetus and Fortuna where they are now, to give new players a break from the node-to-node slog and overall content drought.
- Terrible customer support.
- There is very little info on how to progress past Uranus. So heed my words, when you hear odd sounds in Uranus sealab words... GET YOUR SCANNER OUT AND SCAN THE NOODLE MONSTERS!

How to ruin your life:

1) Download Warframe
2) Learn how to press buttons on your keyboard to play Warframe
3) Grind for hundreds and thousands of hours for that one thing that looks really cool.
4) Congratulations, you now have no life.

This method is tried-and-true, I have even tested it on myself; that's how sure I was that it would work.


Edit: A few people are adding me for help on WF. Feel free to add me if you wish, and I'll try my best to accept and answer any questions you may have, but just know I may not have time to play more than a few rounds with you :c Sorry.
It's something about being a super-powerful space ninja that just feels... [b]amazing[/b].

This is a game that revolves almost entirely on grinding.
It doesn't try to hide it, but embraces it and makes it feel as good as it possibly can.

Movement is responsive and comfortable.
Weapons all have a special feel to them, and with so many there's almost guaranteed to be one that fits into your niche. (There's the giant lazer cannon, the harpoon gun, the weaponized microwave...)
Warframes (the unique player characters in this game) all have cool abilities that make you feel cool. (From freezing a group of enemies in an avalanche to throwing everyone around in tornadoes to placing down traps, tripwires, and mines for enemies to walk into.)

There are quests with some nice story as well, to unlock some amazing content, beautiful cinematics and great dialogue included.

The developers of this game are also incredibly active, with someone often taking control of the server to make witty comments in the regional chat. They also stream developer updates each week, and push out new content very often.

There is an economy in this game, which allows you to purchase in-game stuff like weapon and warframe slots for the currency, Platinum, but it's tradeable and you don't [b]need[/b] to spend any money if you aren't afraid of some grind.
I have over a thousand hours and still have yet to spend a single cent on this game, and I love that fact.

10/10 but still in alpha or something somehow

[h1]ADDITIONAL INFORMATION[/h1]
- This is one of the most well-made free to play games I've come across. This along with PlanetSide 2 [i](in it's prime)[/i] are real gems to the gaming/fps/PvE community.
I started playing it in 2013, at this point it was just a poor TPS still in beta, stopped playing after around 20 hours.


Mid 2015, getting back to it, looks like some kind of MMORPG but in closed areas. Played it for 600 hours and stopped again because it became redundant and cause i didn't really know what to do anymore. Although at this point if you asked me what would be a good MMORPG imo I'd say warframe but open world

End of June 2017 I start playing it again, and one week later what do they say ? it's getting open world 

10/10 this game is permanently in evolution and i find it awesome. it changed so much just to get always bigger and better
first week: its ok
Second week: cool game 
Third week: wow, great game
fourth week: 300 hours? this cant be right!
fifth week: 430 hours, i have a problem...
This free game comes bundled with a time travelling device. Once you turn it on, you will lose track of time and spend an entire weekend like it was only 5 hours.
[h1][Introduction][/h1]
Warframe, my go-to grinding game, is a complex and cooperative free to play third person shooter experience enhanced by an enormous sci-fi world that has been ever expanding since it’s beta in 2013. Digital Extremes have been constantly updating and polishing the game while adding new things every single month since it’s official “release”. Yes, it’s hella time consuming, but the good kind of consuming, it’s actually enjoyable and engaging.
 
As with all of my reviews, these are my own opinions and experiences; please check out other reviews too!
 
[h1][Negatives][/h1]
While Warframe has a tutorial, it is not nearly sufficient enough for the insane complexity. It teaches you basic stuff about combat and movement, and then you are basically thrown out of the nest. Sure, there is the ingame codex that tells you all kinds things but the wiki/wiki threads will always be your best friend while playing Warframe. Many aspects have to be learned and discovered by yourself which can lead to a lot of new players quitting the game early since they can’t figure out what to do or where to go. You often have to keep the wiki open in the background since there is just that much information to the game.
 
Digital Extremes are in my opinion one of the best developers out there. They communicate with their community and listen to feedback. But even despite that, Warframe suffers from feature creep and old additions to the game that just feel left behind. Great concepts like archwings, raids, PVP or the glorious void fall flat compared to the rest of the game since they get boring pretty fast or just feel unpolished and there haven’t been many updates to them in ages. Additionally, most weapons and mods are just weak compared to other, better versions rendering them either useless or only good if you get a good riven mod for them.
 
Riven mods help to counter the weapon feature creep if you would be able to get them more frequently but unfortunately you only get them from daily missions, warframes daily quests, or other players. These are weapon enhancement mods for a random weapon with random stats, dropped randomly as a reward from said missions. The chance to get one of these is already very small but then you have to get the right mod for the right weapon with the right stats. While stats can be rerolled, most rivens will end up sitting in your inventory forever unless you turn them into endo, sell them, or find a player who is willing to spend some platinum on it.
 
[h1][Level/Enemy Design][/h1]
Each faction has its own tilesets which are randomly put together at the beginning of each mission making it less repetitive than it would be otherwise. Each area of the solar system is controlled by a different faction and some of them even by two while the whole galaxy seems to be at war which each other. Enemies look original and well fleshed out and there is a big variety of them present in each faction while all of them have uniquely themed bosses.
 
[h1][Gameplay][/h1]
Warframe offers an overwhelming variety of enemies, locations, weapons and warframes each with their own unique style and charm. It’s easy to get lost in all this and apart from some story quests, it’s really up to the player how he wants to spend his time in this game since Warframe won’t give you any goals, you simply have to set your own, there is no real endgame. Want to be the best looking warframe? Collect all the weapons/warframes/mods? Reach the currently highest Master Rating? Create one of the biggest Clans ever? The possibilities are vast and that is what’s so captivating about this game.
 
Obviously, warframe is pretty grind-heavy and can feel pretty tiring at some points. Why is warframe so enjoyable though? First and foremost because of the excellent polish and design in general but also because of its fantastic movement system which features wall-running, double jumping, sliding and more that really help in making you feel like a ninja in space. The shooting is just so refined and precise while different damage and enemy types force you to switch weapons and warframes accordingly based on your next mission. Many different mission types like extermination, spy, defense, and many more ensure that no warframe is truly useless. If you should get bored with your current setup, try recommended builds for warframes and weapons or simply create your own. Augments can help a great deal with this since they can basically enhance your abilities or change how they work, resulting in a different playstyle.
 
Crafting is done similarly to other games where you just get everything and craft it, only in this case you have to wait several hours and for some things even one to three days, but it is fine if you keep building other stuff in the meantime so you get a chain going. Trade missing blueprints from other players or sell your duplicates to them and earn platinum, the premium currency, and use it to upgrade your maximum number of slots, buy weapons/warframes directly of the market or just get some beautiful fashion for your warframe, the business model is just great. But be aware, the number of trades per day is tied to your mastery rating.

[h1][Free to play][/h1]
Yes, Warframe is free to play but does that mean that this is hurting it? Not at all, since it is using a very fair business model. Almost all of the things you can buy with the premium currency, platinum, can be farmed without spending any money. Earning this premium currency is rather easy since you are able to trade almost anything with other players and platinum is no exception. Of course, buying things directly from the market is much faster but getting them without spending anything is not only cheaper but also a rewarding experience.
 
[h1][Graphics][/h1]
While Warframe certainly can’t be called high end in terms of graphics, it’s making excellent use of it’s engine and is very slick and clean looking as a result of that. However, the game wouldn’t even look half as good as it can be if one would turn down everything to the lowest settings. Shaders and reflections as well as many other little things add up to create an experience that is not only pleasing to the eye but one that can also stand up to today’s AAA games.
 
[h1][Story][/h1]
Because of its nature, story is mostly told through quests which there are 20 of. While a handful of them are interesting and make you want to learn more about this universe, most of them are just a series of regular missions with special voice lines and objectives tagged on to it. Sure, there are bits and pieces everywhere in Warframe’s world, but people who are craving for more lore have to utilize wikis and forums to get the whole picture.
 
[h1][Music][/h1]
Warframe’s soundtrack can be astonishingly good at times but being as grindy as it is, most of the songs will sadly fall short in the long term or will get boring to listen to if you hear the same ones over and over again. Otherwise the soundtrack just fits perfectly and some songs even make use of voice which fits for every situation and almost all of the different tilesets have their own songs which fit each of the different factions greatly.

[h1][Conclusion][/h1]
Besides it’s fair free to play business model, it offers a huge variety of weapons and warframes and just everything else really but it als offers an insane amount of freedom that is rarely seen in games today. I recommend this gem to anyone who enjoys third person shooters with focus on cooperation or people who are just looking for a grindy experience to pass some time and have fun while doing it.

Warframe is a wonderful time-sink, and a fine example of what a game with a good F2P system looks like.
This won't be an extensive review.

To answer what is probably one of your first questions right off the bat:
No, you don't have to ever pay a cent to complete the game or get the full experience.
You can even trade in-game items to obtain the premium currency, for free.

Warframe is a game I recommend to anyone who would be interested in a game with nigh-endless content, simple gameplay loops, and good co-op third person shooters.

It can be rather difficult to get into, I absolutely recommend diving in with a friend; all the better if they're familiar with the game already.
People in the public chat rooms tend to be helpful, but Warframe can be a confusing and overwhelming experience for the new player.
Warframe didn't catch my attention when I first began playing it with a friend (I was playing it exclusively because my friend wanted me to play it with them), but fast foward only a month or two later, and now I have double their mastery rank and triple the playtime. So, the game grew on me.

Warframe is not only hands-down the best F2P game I've ever played, but a wondrous experience with friends, and one of my favorite games.

Strongly recommended, just play up to the first story quest before you make a decision to stop playing it.
A lot of Warframe reviews bank on the point that it's free, and so what's the harm with trying? The answer to that is, potentially a lot. Dispense with the idea that Warframe is free - that aspect is entirely irrelevant, free or not a bad game is still bad and certainly not worth a damn.

I recommend Warframe solely because it is a [i]good[/i] game.

Daunting, yes, Warframe is huge - as it well should be after almost six continuous years of post-release development, but that quantity upholds a consistent level of quality rivalling any other well received, well reviewed title. This game certainly demands time investment, and that aspect can put off new players that are expecting to progress at a rapid pace. You can reach a decent point in the game after some investment, but it will take thousands of hours to truly complete everything it has to offer.

As an online, instance-based, multiplayer, sci-fi action game Warframe belongs to a fairly niche market - it's most prominent rival being Destiny, and yet these two are so utterly perpendicular in their goals and aspects. Warframe is truly unique, an experience I've never encountered anywhere else, and truthfully not tailored to everyone's particular tastes.

It's big, we've touched upon that, but exactly what is it offering? Quests, progression, customisation, combat, design, music, graphics? How do these all play out in practice? Are they all great?

Short answer, no. It's hard to make a perfect game; impossible in fact, but Warframe certainly pushes some boundaries. Questing has been improving greatly over the years, and the content in the last couple has provided amazing lore and gameplay mechanics with some exceptional writing - and they seem only to be improving.

Progression and customisation tie into one overarching aspect. There's no denying that it starts off slow. Warframe is a grindy game, it makes up a large portion of the time needed to complete it, but it pays off. In a couple weeks you'll have a few frames and a bunch of weapons, in a couple of months you'll have accrued quite the varied arsenal, and within a year you'll likely have almost everything, if not all of it. Warframe doesn't tie you down or make things too hard, it just demands you put in the effort to reap the reward.

The combat of Warframe is simple, and yet incredibly complex. There could be a review on this in and of itself, so I'll make it brief - there is huge variety, and this is no mere point and click to win game (unless you're Saryn).

The design of Warframe is ever undergoing changes, to the current UI overhaul in progress, to the constant graphical improvements, to the general improvements and overhauls of map tiles and geographical spaces. The latest of which, the massive open world of Fortuna, has turned out to be and incredible display of amazing and well detailed level design.

Now, it is not without its downsides. Bugs are frequent, though ultimately the vast majority are very minor and inconsequential. It is rare to face a bug that truly causes major problems. Graphical optimisation isn't great, especially with the open world maps. 

I think there must be mention of how the Market can seem unfair to new players, as it implies weapons must be bought with Platinum, but this is not the case - everything can be crafted.

Now, I will touch on the free to play aspect lastly - I've covered that this is a game and is worth your time, but I dissuade the notion one might have that it is dangerous simply because it IS free to play. Warframe Bears perhaps the most forgiving free to play scheme ever - and that is because you can obtain everything without ever paying a penny. Platinum, the premium currency, can be obtained by simply trading in-game items to players - one can accrue thousands upon thousands without ever putting money into this, and that is what is recommended.

Don't shy away because you think you'll be bottle necked into buying your way to progress, it is never the case.

Bottom line - Warframe is a great game, free or not. You should give it a go - and make friends, it's the best way to play.

Great optimization
Im running it on AMD Radeon HD 5450 2gb, Athlon II X4 640 3.0Ghz cpu and
800 x 600 resolution + everything low/off
If you're afraid of playing this just because your machine is a toaster, you dont have to worry about it fam.
Space... Ninjas.

I shouldn't have to say anything more.

Fair warning: If you're not willing to spend a LONG time playing this game, you'll find your options kind of limited. You start with 2 character slots, 6 weapon slots and 50 plat, 20 plat can get you a character slot and 12 plat can get you 2 weapon slots. You'll pretty much want to spend this 50 plat on slots, as everything else is a waste. Getting more plat costs money and I highly recommend that if you want to spend some money on plat, log into the game every day and wait for the 75% discount to show up. With the discount, a one time purchase of about 1000 plat should set you up for life if all you buy is slots and you don't care about having all the weapons. If you want to collect ALL the weapons, you'll probably want to spend $50 and go for the 3000 plat option.

The mod grind (collecting thingies to improve your stats and the stats of your weapons) can take a stinking long time to work through, but if you can have fun doing it (after all, it just means playing the game a lot), you'll be rewarded with weapons that feel like they do more than tickle the enemies you fire them at.

Good mods and good weapons are required if you want to be more than a leech on the later planets, but everyone's usually blasting through the missions so fast that they hardly notice if you lag behind and die horribly to the handful of enemies they overlooked.

I'd say the biggest problem this game has is a lack of reasons for veterans to return to old content. It can be really difficult to get a group for that one mission you need to unlock the other mission you need to unlock the mission that unlocks the next planet you want to get to to work your way towards that boss that drops the parts you need to make the warframe (class) you wanted a week ago and still haven't reached.

Playing with friends is recommended.
Been playing this game off and on for 4 years, only leaving because it's so hard not to play other games. Every time I come back, the game is SIGNIFICANTLY better than it used to be, which is surprising because it's always been good.  I seriously recommend it, as long as you don't mind grinding.

Everything except skins are available for free as long as you don't mind working for what you want, and even the in game currency is obtainable through player to player trading.  I can't praise Digital Extremes enough for demonstrating good game development. I just hope other companies follow suit.  Hail to space mom!
Today i hit the 3.000 hours on record, so i must make a maximal positive review of it! Why after that much gameplay? I was a bit lazy :)

The game is about lots of fun, grinding, massively build new stuff's like weapons, companions (as Kubrows, Kavats & Sentinels) and Warframes. The atmosphere of the game is very unique, the story of the Warframes and the Tenno, damn i love the Lotus voice, it is so sexy, and cool, sounds like im in a scifi movie - so perfect!
The community growing like the game's content, new missions, events coming time to time, with the next huge update we become a new sandbox world o.O I'm so curious for that content, can't wait... see you in the new open world area Tenno ;)
No matter what anyone says, this game isn't a pay to win game. You can get every single item in the market in different levels. This is what a modern free to play game should admire to be. [spoiler]Please don't sue me.[/spoiler]
Pros:                                           
1. Runs on low system specs.
2. Looks amazing.
3. Gameplay is slick and smooth.
4. Great progression system.
5. You don't have to buy anything with real cash.
6. Regular updates keep it fresh.
7. Loads of game types and Maps.
8. Play on your own or with friends.
9. Higher level peeps help you and give tips.
10. It's in Space.
11. It's FREE.

Cons:
1. Distinct lack of tutorials, can be overwhelming & off putting at first. That's it....

When I first started playing, I was totally lost, but I stuck with it as the gameplay was so damn good. (Reminds me of MAss Effect 3......on Steroids) Then I youtubed a few things and the game just opened up for me. This is how games should look and play, also being free is a bonus:-)
Before you read into this review, let me ask you one question. Do you think fun is the most important thing in any game? If you answered yes, stick around and keep reading. If you answered no, you probably wouldn't like Warframe. 

Warframe gets a lot of flak for being repetative, but I personally feel that the reviewers who complain about the gameplay being repetative are failing to see the bigger picture. 
Warframe is not about a deep, gripping narrartive or memorable characters, it's about action, fun, and pretty crazy weapon variety. And to top it all off, everything that impacts gameplay can be obtained for free. 
Warframe is a very specialized game, focused on action, flare, and fun. And boy oh boy does Warframe nail action and fun. With over a dozen unique Warframes(Powersuits used by the player, each with their own unique abilities and stats) to choose from you're sure to find one that you really enjoy playing as. And then there's the weapons. Oh boy, the weapons. This game has almost every kind of Sci-Fi weapon I can think of. We have small scale particle cannons, Beefy sniper rifles, plasma casters, living weapons that shoot everything from Electricity to streams of deadly viruses, an insanely powerful rocket launcher, a Grenade launcher with remote detonation, powerful bows, a gun that shoots spinning saw blades, and of course the obligatory pew-pew assualt rifles to ease new players into the experience. Oh, but that's just the Primaries. In every mission, you will have the option to carry a Primary, a Secondary, and a Melee but you can choose to carry only 1 or 2 if you please.
The Secondaries include but are not limited to: Living weapons that shoot Corrosive darts and poison gas, a goo gun that shoots sticky globs of acid that eat right through armor, 2 deadly hand cannons, one of which shoots many metal balls in a shotgun spread while the other shoots a spread of radiation blasts, Miniature plasma casters, rapid fire dual pistols, a spread-rocket launcher that they somehow compressed into the size of a pistol,  a pistol that shoots bolts that can pin enemies to walls, deadly and accurate burst fire pistols, pocket snipers, Revolvers, a Lever action beast, Throwing knives, Throwing stars, and a Standard semi-auto pistol to ease new players in. 
And then there's my favorite weapon class, the Melee.
We've got Greatswords that can hit numerous enemies in a wide arc, more conservative longswords that swing fast and allow better mobility while attacking, Dual daggers which generate an incredibly fast flurry of slashes and stabs, whips for when you want the range of a greatsword but the mobility of a longsword, there's also the polearms, Heavy axes, Heavy hammers, ROCKET HAMMER, and even the Thrown melee weapons, useful for killing at a distance while conserving ammo and for stealth kills. More recently Digital Extremes added in 2 Katanas and a set of claws that pop out of your arms like Wolverine. 
Melee has become much more prominent lately now that DE has completely revamped it. No longer do you simply mash or hold E, now you can perform different combos that require different inputs. These combos are assigned to stance mods that you can apply to your weapon. Each melee weapon class I mentioned above has at least 1 stance mod, and each mod comes with it's own unique combos that are useful for different purposes and situations. My favorites are the Katanas with Decisive Judgement as the stance. I use it to make my tenno look and fight like Vergil from Devil May Cry 3. 

So yes, Warframe can seem repetative to some people, but not to me. I greatly enjoy the vast arsenal that is placed before me, and I truly believe that these tools of destruction make up for the lack of deep narrative. 

That said, I thoroughly recommend Warframe to anyone who likes Shooters or character action games, or anyone who likes having fun.
In this review, I will post both my positive and negative feelings about the game. I feel I have been playing it enough by now to say something and be taken seriously.

The positive things I can say are:

- the game is fun and addictive. You will enjoy playing as a space ninja, once you get the hang of it.

- The devs are constantly trying to find new ways to keep the game interesting and relevant to players.

- The lore and story mode are interesting, engaging and well put together.

- The community is mostly great, partly crazy and overall decent to new players.

- The game is truly F2P. You *can* spend money to buy the special currency, but you don't *have* to. There are ways to get it in game with a little effort.

- Each Warframe has it's own personality and feel to it. Though there are similarities between them, you will find one to your liking if you play long enough.

The negatives I will list as:

- very grindy game. You have to put in work to get just about anything past the starter items.

- Speedrunners. This is my onw pet peeve, and should be taken with a grain of salt. It's my opinion that the stages and world of Warframe needs to be experienced some in order to fully immerse yourself in it. It also takes time and some searching in most cases to find useful items and resources. Speedrunners will clear a stage before you've even begun to search through it. I usually get a MUCH larger sense of satisfaction (along with stars and sculptures and fragments and other important stuff) by searching through a stage than by rushing it... but almost everyone DOES rush them. Takes a lot of fun out of it when they do it even when you ask them not to.

- Plains of Eidolon. (This one is likely to be temporary, as they're still constantly making stuff, so their focus will naturally shift to other things as time passes) it's a new concept for the game and it's kinda sucking the life out of everything else. All new content that's been released recently has gone into the Plains. As someone who only sometimes goes there, this is kinda of frustrating, since I ALSO want to do new things without having to go to 'this one spot here'. The game is about an entire solar system, not just one spot on Earth. Non mission gameplay there can range from frustrating to boring... though I still like the idea of an open world. They just need to remember the rest of the solar system.

- Timers. When building things, you have to wait. Some things take a few hours, which isn't too bad. Some take half a day... which is still kinda ok. Some take a full day, which ranges from annoying to 'Where the F is my item already?!' Forma taking 24 hours to make is an example. Crafting a full warframe takes 3 1/2 days... assuming you make each of the parts for the frame at the same time, then craft the frame immediately after. And that's kinda dumb. The frames and weapons are the main draw of the game.

- Extremely New/Old Players.

New Players: 'What's this?' 'What's that?' '...what's this again?' '...Can someone give me [fill in the blank with literally anything, even easy to aquire stuff]?' 'Can someone help me?' (Never says what they need help with; asking just gets silence, then sometimes someone raging that no one will help them.)

Old Players (not ALL, just those special few, you know who you are): 'You're doing it wrong. ...tell you how to do it? ..egh.' '[Fill in the name of a warframe] sucks.' (Mostly because they don't use/like it.) [Old player lounging in region trolling literally anyone who says anything; sometimes for hours.] 'Help you? Pfft!' 'STOP BEGGING!!!' (proceeds to rant about people begging for an hour, talking about how hard they worked for all the things they have. Will sometimes claim to have destroyed one of the item the person was asking for just to troll them.)

- Pick Up Groups. When forming a random 'public' group, the game will try to match you with people doing the same missions. This sometimes matches you with people who are REALLY far away from you, resulting in 'over 9000!!!' ping. This will result in a 'session not found' problem that will toss you right back into your ship. Sometimes, the person who was made the host will decide to leave the mission before you're actually IN the mission. So you get made to wait while the system changes the host. Which can get tricky, because then someone ELSE can leave and it takes forever to actually get into the mission... if you don't end up back on the ship. People you get matched with don't have to play with you. They can run off and do whatever they want, and you can't do anything except either go with their flow, or quit the mission and try again. (see me previous 'speedrunners' comment.) Sometimes you'll be just about to pick up that item you've been searching for, then the mission ends because everyone ran to the exit and dragged you along.

- Limbo. ...I'm gonna leave it at that. xD If you've played the game enough, you already understand. If you haven't... just be prepared.

I have two things I consider to be neutral comments.

Starting the Game. The game has a fairly annoying startup. There is little direction for new players... which I think might be intentional to get those players to engage with the community. I feel it might be nice to just be able to follow a simple tutorial, though.

No Marketplace or Economy Tracing. The only way to find out anything about trading is to go to another website that was made by players to help people buy and sell items. There isn't any introduction into this important mechanic either, as the only way to get new slots for weapons or warframes is through buying and selling items for platinum... or paying for it directly. This kinda lures some players into spending RL money on plat, and makes others literally quit the game, being unaware of the fact such a system even exists. Considering one of the factions literally exists for money, there's a big opening there to making an introduction to trading in the game so more players know how things work.

Basically? The game needs to teach new players how to play before tossing them into things without direction, as it currently does.

Overall, I would recommend this game because, simply put, it's fun. The lore is very engaging and enjoyable to discover and if you like the concept of running around being a space ninja and preserving the balance of power in the universe, then this will appeal to you. The various personalities in the game, from Vay Hek to Alad V are engaging and interesting in their own right, and provide some good challenges. There's a good sci fi vibe going on that is preserved even as they use 'archaic' weapons in their fights, like swords. The community, for all its randomness is a very comfortable, silly, helpful one and it's sometimes a thing to do to just chat with people about whatever topic is getting worked on... guess that puts me in the 'old player' catagory. x3 New stuff is happening all the time; the devs seem determined still to keep producing new content for the game, and though a lot of the oldest players are upset over older mods of play being set aside, history tells that the devs will restore things eventually.

the open world concept of Plains of Eidolon are in development, even though you can fully experience them and play in them, and this model will keep getting improved and expanded apon, providing more varied and enjoyable aspect to the game; Venus is already in production at the time of this review.

And the devs are commited to making more and better content. There are those out there who are complaining about things changing, and I basically say that if the game remained static, or only followed their personal intersts, it wouldn't be any better.. just better for those people who are complaining. Raids were fun for the top teir of players, and no one else. If De had focused on only that, everyone else who wasn't top tier (a much larger number of players) would have been left hanging.
Pros:
- Technically Free
- Can be played solo or in groups
- Can build just about anything given time
- Various mission types
- Can be casual or hardcore
- Friendly community
- Some gorgeous graphics and designs

Cons:
- Slots for more weapons and Warframes cost Platinum (premium currency - which can be traded between players, to be fair)
- Can be overwhelming with the amount of content that has been added
- Very grindy
- Some of the nicest fashion options can get pricy

Overall:
There are times when I want something mindless to play after a day at work and it is easy to pick up easier missions. 
There are times when I want to get serious and there are missions for that. 
Highly recommend giving it a few hours.

Edit: I have been playing this game about 1 month at the time of this review
When you Start to Play this game
First few hour - Wtf is this shit?
After 10hrs - hey that's Pretty cool
After 50hrs - send help I can't stop playing this game
If you re reading this, you re propably asking yourself if this game is worth getting it.
Man this game is free2play why dont you just install and check it out?

Warframe is AMAZING. Unless you're looking for a game where you can kill or troll other players, I definitly recommend it.

Multiple reasons why:
1. Very flexible Characters - you have A LOT of available characters called warframes to choose from, eachwith special ability sets - pick whatever you like !
2. An awesome crafting system - you have multiple different ressources you will need to craft betweeen hundreds of different weapons (which all you can pimp to be good weapons, there are almost no weapon which is "useless")
3. You re a damn spaceninja what else do you want to be, a fire breating dragon with a sword and uzis? well fine have it, it is called CHROMA the Dragon Warframe!
4. Spacemum (The Lotus) needs you!
5. No toxic community - YES you heared right NO TOXIC COMMUNITY IN THIS GAME
6. this game has like the most amazing devs ever, they stream personaly about what they are doing and sometimes even when they play themselves, you get freestuff if u watch, sometimes you get even freestuff randomly just because, usually in form of ridicously eazy mini missions with big rewards.
They keep adding new and exciting elements into the game.
Unlike EA or Valve they care about the game and not about money. Money is purely for cosmetics. (Or to reduce the grind out of some stuff) Every update and every single piece of content is for free.
7. Awesome quests (at least later on, the first few could need a little bit....restauration maybe)
8. I have played Warframe for a very, very long time now idk how many years, and it has come very far and it is far from done yet
9. Beautiful Grafic (Except for the Grineer maybe)
10. In no other game did i experience such a broad side of customization available. like you can pick between thousands of colors for up to 5 parts of your character and your waeapon and also your attachments, helmets and Sigils and you can even change your ability color and your emotes and your characters pose style and so so so much more. You can spend like hundreds of hours in this game just to optimize your characters looks. Fashionframe they call it :)

You think there are negative aspects as well ? yea sure of course everything has negatives sides no ?

1. For a free2playgame, it is to expect to be grindy a lot and yes it is especially if you re new. you will need many different ressources, and a lot of it and if they add new stuff you usually require a large amount to get it (if it isnt for free that is)
2. Warframe is REALLY COMPLICATED - at the start. In the beginning, you will have no idea on how the f is going on, you do have a tutorial of course, a very large one at that but it doesnt cover everything and not really deep into the few parts it comes through. And there is so much you can do in this game you simply cant understand everything right at the start but it s gonna worth it.
3. pvp is kinda - nah, consider this game more like coopcontent. Although i know of some ppl who just love it.
4. the only thing you cannot farm or grind are weapon/warframe/companion/rivenmod slots, and colorpalettes (you CAN get the latter for FREE still, but only on special days like valentines day or halloween and such) which you have to pay platinum for which kinda sucks (even if u can trade the platinum with other players)
5. console gets mega big updates a little bit later than the pc version whichs means you have to be careful not to get spoilered if u play on console
6. if you re running low level missions and get get matched with some really high level dude you might never see any enemies because he keeps killing them so fast (yes i m looking at you embers & saryins)

I admit i have some phases in the game where i dont play it and just look into new content (like a lot of ppl do in mmos and such) WHICH ALWAYS comes though and i always get back into it, i never get disappointed when i go back, it reaaaaallly makes you get addicted to it and when they have another update you wanna try out all the new stuff like kids at christmas.

Thank you DE for doing such a great job!

Yet, another year later: Still Love love L O V E!
Fifty hours in and I've yet to encounter any elements of pay to win. Beyond speeding up timers or unlocking characters or cosmetic fashion(frame) items there is absolutely no need to pay to "advance" the game.

Lots of the mission types are skill based in any case, so no amount of platinum (in game currency) will buy you success.

The game itself is a extremely solid third person shooter. Satisfying. Very. Think destiny with more stuff to do.

Community is absolutely ace too. Vets will actively join you to help you get what you need. And you'll need a lot. Metric ton of blueprints and weapons to try out. 

Also, I have no idea just how many characters there are. I thought street fighter had a large roster! Blown away by how much content is in a free game. The gameplay loop will ultimately be what keeps you playing.

PS the developers have a rather good pedigree too :-)
I'm going to be honest, the only reason I started playing this game was because I needed a loot shooter to play while waiting for Destiny 2...

[spoiler] 500 hours later. It's better than Destiny 2... [/spoiler]
Want a game where developers listen to the community? 
Want a game where a community will welcome you with open arms?
Want a game that has a storyline that will kick you in the nuts so hard and still make you say "That felt GOOD."?

Well Warframe is all that, and I guarantee that if you are a sci-fi lover and an mmo rpg lover, then this game is the absolute best of both worlds. Theres a reason why this game has so much respect in the gaming community. Definitely give it a shot!
[h1]Some lines for the new players[/h1]
Souce IGN reviews and my own thoughs
In the distant future of Warframe, you are a space ninja who has woken from a long slumber to find the solar system in disarray. Armed with a variety of exciting powers, you must fight an army of decaying clones, tech-minded science jerks, mutant freaks and other awesome enemies. The entire game is free to play, but it’s so good that I spent a hundred bucks on it and don’t regret a cent.

For me, it’s a point of pride that I don’t spend money on free to play games. Spending money means giving in to systems designed to manipulate me; it feels like losing. That constant reminder on players to buy, buy, buy is like a movie theatre interrupting a movie every few seconds to remind people that they can buy popcorn and soda any time they’d like. Not giving in to the ads feels like winning against an intrusive and unpleasant experience..

Digital Extremes’ Warframe is different–different enough that I actually bought Prime Access and some platinum. In all, I’ve spent about $100 on the game, something I’ve never done for a free to play game before. I felt like Warframe was worth it.

You don’t have to pay, though, and the game does not constantly dangle the option to pay in your face. The only reminders that you should spend money are located deep within customization menus or in the store, which is a console in your ship that you can easily ignore.

Warframe doesn’t care about balance. You’re a badass space ninja, after all! ... What’s great about being overpowered is that, since everyone is overpowered, no one is.
The multiplatform free-to-play game is an action shooter with some of the trappings of an MMO. It launched in 2013 and is available now on PC, PS4 and Xbox One, where it is regularly updated. As a recently-awoken space ninja called a Tenno, your job is to fly around the solar system doing space ninja stuff like assassinations, spying on people, stealing information, and performing sabotage. Each mission location and type remains the same, but the missions themselves are somewhat randomized. The game relies on a random tile system to keep things fresh. Your base of operations–and your main menu–is your ship.

When you log in, you’re sitting in front of your command console, which lets you select where you want to go in the solar system. To your right is the store. To your left is the codex. Behind you, deeper in the ship, are other stations, like the foundry that lets you build weapons or the armory that allows you to outfit and modify your frames.

Ah, right, frames. The eponymous warframes operate like character classes, except instead of being locked into one class per character, you can swap frames at will, with each frame having four unique powers. For one mission, you might feel like running the supportive frame Trinity, who can mass heal the entire team or provide energy vampire abilities to ensure quick regeneration. On the next mission, you might want to play as Ember, whose incredible World on Fire ability burns every enemy within a massive radius.

You obtain warframes by defeating bosses and getting their parts or by completing some of the game’s great quests. Warframes are not just some cool gimmick or branding idea, but a cool design choice. Two good ideas make them great: first, they’re all overpowered, and second, you have to hunt them down.

Warframe doesn’t care about balance. You’re a badass space ninja, after all! Rather than pushing players through a lengthy and meaningless grind, Warframe provides players tons of awesome and incredibly destructive powers. I love running Frost, a frame that launches a massive blast of ice, freezing everything around it, killing most low-level enemies. Playing like Frost feels like running around as a tactical nuke. The sheer destructive power being wielded is awe-inspiring, but that’s true of every frame. Valkyr’s power is invulnerability. It comes at the expense of ranged weapons, but that’s fine, because as a space ninja, your swords are just as cool, if not cooler, than your guns.

What’s great about being overpowered is that, since everyone is overpowered, no one is. The power you wield makes you feel like you’re actually a badass space ninja, because you’re killing lots of enemies quickly and efficiently. Other sci-fi games, like Mass Effect 2, force you into cover through a lack of health and a focus on small groups of enemies. There’s no sense of lethality or badassery going on when your character feels like they’re made of soggy toilet paper while enemies can last through an entire magazine of gunfire. Warframe understands this, so every frame feels fun to play, because every frame has powerful, over-the-top capabilities.

A friend of mine recently picked up one of the harder-to-obtain warframes, Ivara. He didn’t like her at first, until he realized that, among other things, he could use her abilities to create ziplines anywhere on the map. Ivara drastically altered his mobility and our fireteam’s damage capabilities, allowing us to breeze through content that had previously been too challenging.

I’ve played a lot of games over the years, and it seems like most developers’ idea of balance is that everything should feel equally underpowered. The player generally has to play with caution, staying back, even occasionally bunching up, letting enemies come to them as they cheese their way through fights. Warframe’s “you should feel like a ninja” approach encourages more proactive players who slice, dice, and explode their way through hundreds of enemies. I’ve seen builds that kill every enemy on the field at a given time. I’ve watched players one-hit kill a boss and continue onwards as if nothing happened. Warframe’s lethality doesn’t just make you feel effective. It gets you through content quickly, too.

Most online games require massive amounts of player time but lack sufficient content to actually demand that time. They rely on heavy amounts of repetition and luck. Players have to play a lot to get a little. Warframe instead allows you to pass through content quickly and always guarantees something interesting at the end of the journey.

As a ninja, you can “bullet jump” through most of the maps. Bullet jumping is a way to bypass lots of enemies by zipping past most enemies faster than they can respond. This means that you can get through missions quickly. That works well with another of the game’s better-implemented elements: timed content. Every few minutes, a new challenge pops up. Sometimes, the reward is credits. Other times, it’s crafting materials. I follow a Twitter feed that alerts me any time a blueprint is available. Combined with the speed at which I can complete content, I can catch a Twitter alert, pop into the game, grab the loot I want, and get back to whatever I was doing without a problem.

I recently got an alert for an item I wanted, logged in, played through the mission, and obtained the item within about 10 minutes. The result is a game that can be played in brief 10 to 15 minute spurts, as opposed to a game like The Division, which has a tiny handful of missions that require daily grinding if you want to be able to get enough credits to buy good gear.

Warframe’s speed means that it doesn’t doesn’t demand your commitment, but if you’re looking for something more in your relationship, the game’s got you covered.

A traditional loot game sends you into an encounter with the expectation of randomized loot. Take Borderlands, for instance. The game claims to have about 87 bazillion guns, but how many of those are meaningful or interesting guns? Most of the guns I’ve encountered in the Borderlands series are samey, even unremarkable, with the exception of a few gag guns. The same is true of The Division; I can’t tell you how many Vectors I’ve located, but I can tell you that they all play the same, just doing more or less damage depending on their stats.

I wish more games were like Warframe.
Now THIS is how you handle a free-to-play game.

Gameplay is solid and fun, the lore can be hard to understand, but is still interesting, and the microtransactions not only feel more justified (because you know, free-to-play game), but it doesn't get in the way of gameplay. Probably the only game where I spent money on the microtransactions, and didn't regret it.

This game is just a better Destiny 2.
A great example of what a F2P game should be

Pros:
*Great visuals
*Really well optimised
*A lot of content
*Crafting system
*You can get EVERYTHING in game without paying with real money
*Constantly updated
*A lot of different ways to play the game
*Can be really fun
*Well balanced
*You can get the premium currency via trading in game

Neutral:
*Requires a lot of your time

Cons:
*REALLY grindy
*You have to wait a lot of time for things to craft (for example to craft a warframe you need to craft all of it's parts which takes 12 hours an then 72 hours to actually craft the warframe itself)
The best F2P game I've ever come across. A fair bit buggy, but that's to be expected. The amount of content/updates that are constantly added to the game are insane. To give an example: If you were to compare what Warframe is now to what it was back in 2013, you'd be playing a completely different standalone game in a technical sense. There's so much to cover that I cannot fit it all into one review, but let's start with the fundamentals. The only other shooter I've played with mechanical depth that can hold a candle to what Warframe allows would be Resident Evil 6. This game's combat system is that deep. I'm not talking about things like Mods or attribute values, I'm talking about the sheer number of movement and attack options you have.

In default mode, the shooting mechanics are pretty straight-forward. But the moment you hit the key to switch to a dedicated melee mode, the game reveals its mechanical complexity. With melee now your primary means of attack, you're able to empower attacks, block/parry, do combos through the use of Stance mods. The game now resembles something closer to a simplified version of Devil May Cry than an traditional shooter. Delaying your melee attacks at key points in animations will allow you to do a comboed move rather than a generic slash. And with most Stance mods having at least 5 combo chains, (in addition to some weapons having multiple dedicated Stance mods) the skill ceiling is significantly increased.

Beyond that are your movement options. You can do a sliding slash both on the ground and mid-air. You can run on and scale/hang from walls, dodge in any direction, and can even divekick enemies to knock them down or springboard off of friends and foes alike to complement your standard double jump.

The basic aspects of combat are further supported via the use of Mods. Mods are items that fit into weapons and Warframes alike to help improve and tailor the player's chosen combat style. Every item has 10 Mod slots and 1 Stance or Aura slot. Each Mod has a number value that deducts from a point pool on a chosen item. Mods can also be fused with other mods to improve their effects. Weapons are also able to be fitted with different combinations of elemental mods to produce a new effect. It it through this system that allows Warframe to appeal to virtually any type of player's preferred approach to combat.

Customization is a large part of Warframe, whether aesthetic or stat-wise. You're even able to choose your own ship (though such a choice is purely for show), customize the interior of it along with your frames, weapons etc. Better yet, most Warframes and even certain cosmetic items can be aquired simply through grinding.

This, however, brings us to some of the cons that Warframe can rely on a bit too much at times. The game is very grind-heavy and can eventually wear an individual down as you run the same missions over and over to acquire a certain blue-print, To its benefit, there are a variety of mission types and enviornmental tile sets to go along with them. Furthermore, the game is exceptionally optimized; and is able to keep literally dozens of enemies on screen with respective particle and weapons effects without dropping below 45-50 on a mid-range computer (I had an GTX 660 as reference).

Another problem the game has is its inclination towards being buggy. One of the worst I've heard of so far is the inital Archwing mission causing the game to outright lock up when the game is in Directx 11 mode. There are also numerous other bugs that will crop up as a player puts more and more time into the game.

Certain cosmetic items (and even Warframes) are sometimes only purchasable with Platinum, which requires that players spend real money or trade/sell in-game items to other players for Platinum (if one does not wish to spend real money).

Story-wise, the game explains very little to the player up front and uses Codexs to allow the player to piece the lore together ala. Dark Souls. With multiple factions each having their own agendas in addition to the Tenno themselves, there is a lot of world building content for players to go through.

Overall though, it's an amazing and unique F2P game that will likely not be outdone by its competitors anytime soon. If ever.

Amazing fucking game tho
Best F2P game out there, hands down.

Also, YES
It DOES have a fucking story, you just have to pay attention to it.
It's all Free-2-Play, not Pay-2-Win.

Platinum is a mean to Fashion the hell out of your frames and buy Slot and orbiter decorations.

You can get platinum by grinding rare mods thus making you not pay a single cent.

And last but not least, Ordis that is indeed a crappy pun.

Quick Reminder - IT IS GRINDY AS HELL, WHAT THE HELL DO YOU EXPECT FROM A FREE-2-PLAY GAME. 

Quick Note - People are still saying it's better that Destiny 2.

Quick, quick Note - Read the wikis and don't be scared to ask if you're in need of help. We're all here to help. 

Now may RNGesus Bless us all with our Riven Rolls so that we can sell them for 1000 Platinum.
[h1]Community is by far the least toxic I've been in. DE does really well catering to fans and keeping their quality up. I don't think you'll find a better dev/community combo anywhere else. Its fun... Just remember to read the fine print.[/h1]

[i]"Digital extremes is not liable for any damage caused by a spontaneous addiction to alien juice, ancient gold puzzle pieces, increased appreciation for potatos, and a being damned by RNGesus himself. If you find yourself spending hours wasting away in a chair grinding for said items you are entirely at fault and digital extremes will not be held accountable in a court of law."[/i]
I've only been playing Warframe a little over a month, but it's consumed me. My soul has been devoured by this game. And I have loved every moment of it.





Months later:


Soul devoured. Confirmed.
Simply better than most games you paid to play on store. Contains : Explosions, ninjas, robots, weird stuffs, gri--###-- Clem!
##WARNING this game could cause :
- Extreme wallet drain.
- Long list of steam update queue. 
- Uncertain amount of playtime. (Over 100+ hours)
- Excessive grinding
- Excessive self-isolation.
- Sleeping in class/work.

[b]Proceed with caution.
Ok, I told myself: "If I reach 1000 hours in this game, I'll write a review"

And I'm not here to tell you about the game (there are other reviews that do that better than me), but I will tell WHY I like it.

First of all: Customization. 
Second: You can play this MP game entirely alone!
Third: The community isnt thaaaaat bad.
Fourth: The Devs (kind of) listen
Fifth: The grind is not exhausting - you can get your stuff rather quick

So, yea! Pretty good! Thumbs up for WARFRAME!
Warframe is one of those games that you quit for a while because of what ever reason you might have but then come back to it eventually [spoiler]Unless your launcher is an ♥♥♥ and updates slowly[/spoiler] and you get immersed into it again, especially with the most recent addition to the game, Plains of Eidolon. 
For those of you that don't know, warframe is set in a space like eniverse with multiple planets to explore in your "ninja-like" warframe. The game has 3 different races that the player can oppose, Grineer, Corpus and Infested each with different [spoiler]annoying[/spoiler] enemies and mechanics to face.

Pros:
 - Free to play
 - Amazing visuals
 - Great optimisation
 - Can choose if the player wants to play solo or multiplayer
 - A lot of different game modes for the player to enjoy
 - A lot of different Warframes and weapons to enjoy
 - Fixed Archwing
 - Dojos
 - Variety of different missions to enjoy
 - Free2play without being pay2win

Cons:
 - At some point the game gets repetitive (mostly only when farming for something)
 - Sometimes the game feels like you're just mashing one button, mostly vs infested [spoiler]Melee masterrace[/spoiler]
 - Long update times due to the launcher (at least for some people)

Game overall is great and most definitely worth checking out especially since it's of high quality AND free to play.

[spoiler]All I could ask of this game is if we can have any more and better scythe melee weapons.[/spoiler]
Warframe is by far my favorite game and most likely will be for all time. It's a beautiful game that runs on nearly all systems. The game is a third person shooter focused on PvE with character abilities, quality gunplay, and unlike most shooters Melee is a perfectly viable alternative. 

Almost every gun has a different feel and or use than any other gun even if both are snipers, shotguns or any other subset of gun. They all sound different and look different except in a few cases in which some guns have superior versions of the same gun with the same name and a minor change in visuals. The melee weapons in the game follow the same theme in that every melee weapon is different than all the other melee weapons in use and visuals aside from a few that have superior versions. All of these weapons can be used to a large extent in most of the gameplay aside from a few of the beggining ones obviously meant for newer players in lower tier content. 

On to the "Player Characters" the Warframes themselves, each and every Warframe is vastly different from all the others when it comes to powers. For example, theres a frame that freezes enemies in time, an invisible robin hood like bow frame, one that controls the bodies of the dead, and another that makes gaint walls of glass while coating enemies in it. That said, every frame is capable of quick movement all across the maps you'll encounter with a bit of practice, they can all roll, sprint, super jump, double jump, wall run, and dash on tightwires. High power characters moving at a quick fun pace.

The enemies in the game are 4 real factions, Grineer (Cloned soldiers clad in armor using ballistic weapons.), Corpus (High tech robots and merchants who worship money as their religion.), Infested (Units from the two previous factions and enemies of an age long past infected with a biological weapon and connected to a network of hive minds.), and Sentients (Self aware synthetic life forms created to adapt to anything and everything long ago.). As you go through the game, the enemy units will get significantly more challenging as you yourself also grow stronger. With enough work you can mow them down like grass, or you could be the grass yourself.
 
Now on to the free to play aspect, if any game deserves that title, Warframe is that game. Warframe has the cleanest free to play game I have ever played. All weapons and Warframes are free to obtain. Everything in the game can be obtained without premium currency except cosmetics. If you want cosmetics? Don't worry, you can trade items earned in the game for premium currency and other players do this, all the time. Theres very few cosmetics that can't be earned this way and the only reason for that is because they weren't designed by the Warframe team and were made by creative players, the money spent on them turns into a bit of cash in the wallet of the players who created it. No fret though, the cosmetics made by the Warframe team are great if you have no money for player made cosmetics.

For a game that was truly terrible and boring when it first came out, it's impressive beyond anything else. This is a game that truly puts almost every triple A game to shame, most other indie games, and every other free to play game. I love this game and I love the people in it, this is probably the most friendly community in any game. I want new players to join this game, and I'm willing to help teach anyone who needs a little help. Anything to get more people into this lovely game. Feel free to contact me about this game if you have any questions.
[h1]WARFRAME 2013[/h1]
I played Warframe when it was in Beta. Over 300 hours of game time and it was fun! Lots o' fun. Played it so much I burned out and moved onto other games. As time passed and talking to friends that still played WF, their comment was, "you are not going to recognize it."

[h1]WARFRAME 2017[/h1]
Holy Smokes! Things have changed! Digital Extremes really stuck to their guns and put everything into WF and didn't stop.

The start of the game begins like DC Universe. I cringed at that thought until the story pulled it self into Warframe and Wow! What a blast! The core of WF gameplay is still there, but the over all world of WF has changed for the better. Much better! 

I'm very happy with what has become of WF and highly recommend if you are looking for an online shooter that may be played Co-op or solo. Either way WF is a great game! Check it out!
When so many of the reviews are from people with 1000+ hours and they are positive, what is there even to argue about?
Just download it and play already!

Yeah its F2P, but man, this is just F2P done right, no hungry money grab, no totally overprice items, like other games. (PoE I'm looking at you...)

The only dev's I've encountered so far, that actually seem to want to do it right and fair, and who's biweekly devstream is well done too, so many could learn from it!

I'd say 400-1000 hours and you'll be near the "I tried it all, and beat it senseless" time to take a break.. Then 6 months go by and some new stuff comes out and before you know it, you've just spend another 100-200 hours milking that content.. for free... then some other big game comes out, you leave WF behind for a bit.

Then 6 months down the line, WAMBAM - new stuff to dig into.. but wait, its a giant open world planet... "sigh.." bye bye life... 

Best part, its free... no pay to win, no I have to open my wallet.
In time you slowly will, because you'll find a favorite frame, a favorite sword and some new skin comes out and you'll start to drool over it and just go "I must have!" and throw that 6-7 usd after it, or they'll release a delux skin you'll be able to just buy for some of the plat you've earned from selling items you gathered for free..

It's a must try and a a game model the entire F2P industry really should copy. Because loot crates and 20 dollar cosmetic items is just a joke that gone on for far too long.

Thank you DE for the many hours of fun so far, and the many more to come!
For those of you who played before 2016, take note - Since The Second Dream's release, Warframe has been extensively given a lot of love and care and is beyond a mere game's worth of content.

For those who are new:

Ever wanted a Free to Play game that's actually NOT PAY TO WIN? Warframe's it, despite looking like a Pay to Win at first glance. Warframes and weapons can be built from the blueprints in-store and the blueprints you earn either in boss fights or the materials you find playing naturally in-game. Prime Warframes and Weapons can be earned through Void Relics and easily traded for Platinum (The game's premium currency) in an economy that easily makes it possible for completely Free-To-Play players to enjoy the game's cosmetics and easily gather the resources they need with a little effort.

Everything takes a short amount of time to farm, and a long time to cook - But if you pace yourself well, you can accomplish a lot within a week of playing this game once you're past the early hours.  This game doesn't hold your hand, however - Expect to get confused with the modding and forma system at first, but it's a satisfying learning experience reminiscent of 90s gaming (Where you actually put some bloody effort into your games.)

Combat is fluid, free-form - The parkour system is genuinely fun to use and fits well with the fast-paced combat of the game. Digital Extremes (Who have history in AAA-gaming before this - The Darkness 2 was a great game if not short) are consistently providing their love and support into the game alongside informing the community of their future plans for the game. 

Hands down I would recommend this game - I mean, my friend's got 7k hours on it so clearly she must find a reason to keep playing it since launch... :)
2014
I gave Warframe a shot. Sci-fi, rushy, run, gun and blade. Battle your way over generic enemies through generic structures or planet surfaces. Was fun, was free and that was it all.

2017
I, a forgotten tenno, came back to Warframe for another battle. I realized story fragments, enjoyed the narratives and understood some of the content and features. I saw that warframe can be whatever i need from a game. I took what i needed. Challenges, levelling, collecting loot and earning new equipment. Progress was satisfying. I saw that i delevoped and became a better tenno. I saw that Warframe changed and became a better game. But the possibilities made me fear the effort i would need to reach the stars. And after a while, in which i tried to reach perfection as a tenno, i abandoned Warframe again.

2019
The urge to serve a greater good is strong in me now. A tenno came back after he found his inner self on a journey of loneliness. I know the challenges and more will be there to come. I know my enemies and more will be after my soul. I know the way to perfection and more obstacles will be there to overcome. A tenno needs patience, mercy and will to understand this game and to see what lays beyond the obvious. A universe full of diverse content and a storytelling which brought tears into my eyes.

Dear Digital Extremes, please keep following your path...
Destiny 2:

it costs $60

the devs lock everything in updates behind dlc, which often costs about $20

it gets boring fast, especially if you don't have friends to do raids with

bs health regen and aiming down sights is basically required

no skill involved considering it's actually hard to NOT hit critical areas sometimes


Warframe:

free to play, but everything you need can be obtained for free

when the game is updated you don't need to buy dlc to get the new content

you will probably never get bored because of the amount of content that is in the game

no bs health regeneration and aiming down sights is not required to fire accurately

you have to EARN your headshots with good aim


basically this game is f2p destiny 2 but it's better in every way. gameplay is actually fun and fast paced, loads of content, active devs that don't squeeze money out of the community, etc.

plus you get farming simulator for free!
One of the best free to play models i encountered:

- No content locked behind paywalls, except decorative stuff with no gameplay impact.
- Ingame currency you can buy for real money (platinum) is not locked to your account, and is tradeable amongst players.
- No lootbox gambling, if you decide to buy stuff, you get exactly what you pay for.

Also i wish i could travel back to 2013 before i started playing warframe and tell myself, that one day i would be more excited about a major content update of a F2P game, than the next Fallout game... just to see my reaction.


Ah warframe. I spent 500 hours with you lovely lady.

Its a wonderful game.

The grind isn't too insane.
The balancing is decent.
And it is not pay to win.

Yes. It is NOT pay to win. I have every single prime (Besides Excal) and I haven't paid a dime.
You just gotta know how to buy for cheap. And sell expensive. Trading 101.

Great graphics. Great optimization.

And guess what. ITS FREE.
PROS
Genuinely looks like a top-tier, triple A game. (great graphics and visual effects)

There's an option to buy items with the premium currency, but all items are still obtainable by grinding. (no pay2win)

Music and the voice acting is great, music is intense and voice acting feels serious, although sometimes can feel silly unintentionally or intentionally. (decent audio)

The movement is extremely fluid and smooth. (great gameplay aspect)

The game developer(s) listen to the community, adjusting the user experience. (community)

It's free-to-play. (out-of-this-world pricing)

Frequent updates and streams by the community manager and developer. (community and gameplay)

The missions are fast-paced. (gameplay)

The modifications that you can do to your character and weapons are endless. (gameplay)

It's not Destiny 2. (everything)

The game is replayable. (long-term gameplay)

The multiplayer is good, although can feel a little bit limited. (decent multiplayer)

CONS
There's language errors in the dialogue.

In summary, this game is extremely good, and Digital Extremes has spoiled me so much. This game is definitely worth your time.
This is nothing like the DarkSector that released.
This is the dream project that Digital Extremes wanted to make.
9/10.
I've started playing Warframe 1 year ago, it was free and looked a nice game.
To my surprise, since it's a free game and there's no "you have to spend real money if you want to progress in the game or have the best things in it", the game is absoltely amazing.
Very addictive, lots of grinding, so many things to do that in the beginning it can be overwhelming.
Highly recomemded!!!!!
So here's my story; I have a really bad laptop that runs Minecraft pretty badly. Then you'd think, "Hmm, why does he recommend it?" BECAUSE IT IS EXTREMELY SMOOTH! On all low settings, I can't tell any diffenence between this and a high powered PC. It's incredible. Online play works great, and I'm getting better every day! I'm amazed at how good it is. 10/10 if there was stars.
I don’t know what I expected from this game when I got into it this year, but it definitely exceeded my expectations. I’ll be honest, what got me into it was - fashion frames, nice graphics, basically, everything visual, but I got so much more. 

I’ll start with cons, because compared to pros I find them to be much fewer. IMO, Warframe is not a noob friendly game. The content is huge and it is so easy to get lost in it. There are no guides or any instructions in the game that tell you what you need or how to get it, if there are any it’s a little bit confusing. Other con is that game is quite repetitive and might become boring fast (I’ll talk about this issue in pros). 

Now, let's hop on to the pros! 

As I have already mentioned, visuals in this game are fantastic. Views from different missions, landing craft and overall atmosphere in Warframe is just beyond captivating with soundtracks topping the cake. Gameplay is fun and satisfying, sometimes challenging, but not impossible. 

Grind is addicting. Once you discover how to farm certain parts (which I didn’t know in the beginning) you are in a loop of never ending farming and it IS entertaining, as well as, rewarding. Basically, the more time you spend in Warframe the more rewarding items/frames you get. 

When I started Warframe I had not even a slightest idea that it had story. I thought it was just an online game and that’s it. Oh boy, oh boy and what I got was - The Second Dream (for those who don’t know it’s a quest) and it blew my mind. 

Speaking of content in the game and issue I have mentioned earlier. There are different kinds of missions, the types, that change from time to time, missions that are always available, quests (missions with story) and open-world zone. If you play this game regularly you will find yourself doing same everyday and this is what might turn you off, but don’t let that change your mind. Developers constantly offer players new content. 

Another huge plus I find in this game is its audience - mature and quite friendly. Of course there are always kids/trolls on the internet, but they are minority in Warframe.

And finally, the game is absolutely free, you can acquire everything if you put enough time into it.
This game feels like it should've been a AAA shooter made by some corporate conglomerate that charges you $120 for the base game and then $29.99 for each DLC they make every 3 months after. But it's not, and it's much more F2P then most F2P games.

Only problem is the end game.
In the end game of racing games, you're driving REALLY really fast in really cool cars.
In the end game of FPS, you're shooting REALLY cool guns and killing really powerful enemies.
In the endgame of a 3rd person space ninja grind shooter, you're.... fishing. and skateboarding. and scanning items. and playing dress-up.
This game won in the 2017 Steam Awards: Labour or Love for a reason. As much of an immersive, and exciting Cooperative free-to-play game as it is, the grinding and farming experience is also intense!  

I won’t go through much detail of the main quests and missions that drive the plot, but that was one of the first factors of the game that drew me in. I was a player who started the game thinking “Wow, it‘s so cool!“ then eventually coming to ask questions as to why we are called Tenno? Why are we able to swap warframes? Who is the Lotus? The main quests answered these questions, and I was satisfied at that. [spoiler]Plus I nearly cried finishing the Second Dream quest.[/spoiler] 

Countless number of weapons, warframes, companions and mods exist for the game, with new additions being added every so often. Heck, I found myself unable to get rid of my Rhino because of how good he is, until I make a Prime variant of it. But all of these come at a cost, which is time and effortless grinding through same missions over and over again. My only comment is that the companions list is quite small. Currently there are only 4 types which are Sentinels, MOAs, Kubrow and Kavats. I hope DE plans on adding more variants of them in the future, as it’s quite easy to max-rank them after 3-4 hours of grinding through lvl 30+ missions. 

Completing the Solar system and it’s planets can be a hassle, unless you are playing with friends/randoms. I started late into the game, and where several of my friends were already Mastery Rank 12+ in the game, so having their help in guiding me through the general mechanics really helped. (You know who you are – Thank you! ❤) 

The game really hit the Sci-Fi genre, especially for the new Relay released, Fortuna. I favor the graphics, and designs of the warframes and weapons too, [strike] and moreso if my laptop didn’t run on potato[/strike]. Lovely audio and BGM supports the atmosphere, from fighting Grineer in Sedna to roaming the Plains of Ediolon.  

Despite completing nearly all the nodes of the Solar system and quests, there will [b]always[/b] be something to do. There’s Alert Missions, Invasions, doing Bounties for Syndicates or even max-leveling all the new weapons and Warframes you craft. DE also publishes events from time to time, like the Nightwave event for this month. It’s never a dull moment for Warframe.  

Outside the game, there is a market for trading Prime and other rare blueprints for Platinum. The trading community is generally nice and welcoming imo, as I have never been vulnerable to hacks/scams (yet). I’ve made over 250+ Platinum selling all the extra stuff that I didn’t need. 

I’ll probably burn out on this game once I hit rank 30, but until then – Warframe deserves all the positive reviews and hype that it receives. But curse the farming mechanic, lol.
Warframe is a tremendous achievement for a completely free2play game.

I'm not going to waste your time with a huge breakdown of the game, this game has a huge community. If you want more information on it, you can easily find it almost anywhere you look.

What I will say is, the beginning is rough IMO. It doesn't give you a ton of direction and feeds you ALOT of mechanics and information that you need to absorb right away. I felt lost after completing the first story quest and then being left with no clear direction of what I should be doing next exactly. But I just kept doing missions and unlocking nodes and new planets until I found my way. 

Because some people bring this up and don't seem to understand: PLATINUM is WarFrame's in-game currency that you buy with real world money. WarFrame CAN be played without spending a single dollar of real world money. It may not seem like it when you get started and see all these fancy things you want that have a PLAT price tag but do some reading on how to earn PLAT without spending real world money, there are lots of ways and nothing should be out of your reach if you're not afraid of putting in the effort to get it.

Some of the vanity items have actual $-Pricetags on them which apparently means the artists get part of the profits from them since they created them, so that's cool but it does mean there are some items you can't get without spending RL money. But it's vanity stuff, you don't need it. 

WarFrame has one of the best free2play models in the gaming world.

Another thing I want to touch on is that in my personal opinion, there's alot of misunderstanding about what kind of game WarFrame is and this is sheerly my personal opinion but to me, I think alot of these people are wrong about what kind of game it is.

WarFrame is a 3rd person, action shooter. Yes, it has very basic gameplay and there's nothing truly challenging about it but that isn't the point to me. It's a game that if you jump in, start playing and you're really having fun with it .. then it offers you quite literally tons of reasons to keep coming back again and again to dash, leap, shoot, and slash legion after legion of enemies to death and it uses the power-grind to keep you feeling motivated, giving lots of options to explore and lots of methods to gain more power or add to power you already have. 

There's dozens of weapons to farm, build and master. There's hundreds of mods to collect, and level up. There's several dozen WarFrames to acquire and master. There's just so much to do in this game but that's only if you're having fun with it in the first place. This is why I like this game. It's simple but it's fun and there's no reason for me to stop playing it any time soon.

WarFrame also functions on a different system than most games with a grind in it. There's alot less RNG in the game. There is some but alot of the items, you BUY the Blueprints straight off the market for credits, then farm materials which drop randomly but you WILL get enough of sooner rather than later -- then build the item you're excited about. It's interesting that it works mostly off a promised reward, with the appropriate effort, and not total RNG.

The Devs are also very dedicated and passionate about their game, and their community. And also, in a world turning corrupt, where big name game companies are looking for ways to squeeze you mercilessly for every dime they can, Digital Extremes actually acted very swiftly to REMOVE a system from the game that encouraged people to keep spending and spending and spending.

The developer who created the system said he never, ever meant for it to be that way and hadn't anticipated how players would view it and when he saw how much money players were spending on it .. rather than being happy, he was mortified and said:   "What have I done?!"  This system was removed from the game ASAP in order to stop players from spending insane amounts of money on it.

It's completely free, it's fun to play, it's got tons of content and it has a dev team who, REMOVED a very "effective" money-maker from the game because they felt it was a betrayal to players and a terrible mistake on their part.

Do you need any more reasons? 

(( Do yourself a favor, though. Any time you wanna know about a WarFrame, where to farm particular items, etc. Just google it. It will save you alot of time and trouble. Also, check out the marketplace in game from your ship. You will find most blueprints for weapons and warframes, and consumable items there. Infact, many items that have a PLAT pricetag on them in the armory, you will find that the blueprints are on the market and cost credits instead, leaving you to farm the items and craft it yourself. Buying it with PLAT, skips the farming and the crafting. Lastly, except in a few rare cases, it's highly recommended that you leave MatchMaking on PUBLIC. You will find players on at all hours of every day, doing Alerts and farm runs on bosses for WarFrames, as well as farming some missions for vital crafting materials. You never know when you get a full squad to make the mission go much faster. People either don't talk in Squads, or are civil/friendly. I've seen one rude comment ever, that was easily ignored. ))

Comment:
"You ever get hammered in that suit?" 
-Lech Kril
100% best free to play game out there.
Pros:
+ Fun (bonuses if u have friends)
+ good looking visuals
+ great story (if u pay enough attention to it)
+ dev's care about the community
+ constant updates (new content or fixes to broken stuff)
+ massacreing thousands of enemies in missions

Cons:
- a LOT of grinding
- lack of beginner help in-game
- requires beginners to have the wiki open on a second screen
Wow! This game has so much complexity and detail, the graphics are amazing, there are some great stories, very fun online and it's free to play! I'm never bored of playing and quite addicted now. You should try it out.
This game, this damn game, is an amazing game. Things I have to say about it? It was EXTREMELY addicting for a bit. 90 hours past two weeks :D, extremely damn fun. But once getting everything I wanted in Warframe it got boring ofc.
Back when I was a normie on the PS4, I remember seeing Warframe in the playstationstore but thinking it was a boring futuristic game. BUT DAMN I REGRET NOT PLAYING SMH 
Overall, Warframe is an outstanding game

Stuff I have to say 
I didn't play Fortuna at all. It looked pretty boring to me 
Uranus (the planet xd) was the most aids planet I played 
Archwing missions are gay
The grind for the game is far beyond me. Its the most time consuming game I've ever had to actually try in. Its worth it
Pets are useless af to me
Story was really good for Warframe being a free to play 
I highly recommend this game if ur a tryhard :DDD
S/o to my homie Incog for giving me the MOST OP MODS for a beginner, damn if it weren't for him I probably wouldn't be so OPP AFFFFF
Also the asses for the female Warframes are far beyond me aswell

Note: Yes my grammer is big gay
Super fun and for a Free to Play a loooooot of effort goes into it. Every week they are changing stuff and every so often they bring out new Warframes, gear and events. super fun but very grindy, be sure to play with friends to not get bored too quickly
I'm shocked to say the least that this game is well optimized for a free-to-play game. You can farm endlessly in one day without getting bored. The developers have created a game where farmers can have a good time while blasting off the heads of enemies. Monsters come in all sizes, space exploration, in-depth customization... SPACE NINJA! What more can one want?

The best part about all of this, is that it isn't pay to win. Yes, you can buy certain frames on the market with higher capacity. No, this doesn't mean that it will have you overpowered over everyone in one day.

The game takes skill and time to master. Players will need to level up their frames and any new weapons. It is not pay to win.
I just bought the game Anthem for $60, and it was very disappointing. Then I remembered I wanted to try Warframe for about a year now, so I installed it a couple days ago. This game is free, and with 14 hours in, I am hooked. I bought some cosmetics only to support the devs on this masterpiece. AND to top it all, this game should be praised for it amazing optimization. Running on 4k, Solid 60fps on a GTX 1080.
I mean, do I have to write anything about this? 

You are a space ninja, killing every organic and inorganic being in your way to find the truth and save the system! 

Satisfying gameplay loop, huge grind (though, you can almost earn everything significant), regular content updates, amazing soundtrack, pretty decent story, great devs and FREE. 

For new players, I would highly recommend reading as much as possible (Wikia is great, the community is even better). Once you get a hang of the things, this will be an unforgettable and unique experience. Hell, even I must refer Wikia sometimes because this game is HUGE. 

A Must Try.
I've played off and on for years but I  always come back. Fashionframe is better than most AAA developed releases. If you're wondering if you should play it, stop reading reviews, the entire game is free. you don't have to spend a cent. If you really want platinum, you get 50% and 75% off daily rewards OR farm some prime and sell it to players.
I don't even like action games. And yet somehow, I find myself having over 700 hours played in Warframe and still enjoying it.
If that doesn't speak for the quality of the game, I don't know what does.
Ok,  so it's a third person shooter where we got a bunch of space knights going faster than sonic with 4 abilities and all the aggressiveness of the DooM slayer.  It's pretty fun,  highly recommended.
My most played F2P game. Really unique, fun missions, multiplayer allowing you to quest with friends, and really cool character roaster to choose from. Only downside was that farming got a little aids and repetitive, but other than that it was super enjoyable. Ash with Nikona prime sexiest combo in the game no cap. I rate this game a solid 9/10 for the hours and money i spent on it.
An astounding game! The movements are so smooth in this game, I totally enjoyed playing this game. I definitely recommend this game for people who have interest in the sci-fi world. A must download game. Keep it up Warframe! 

The first time I played this game on PS4, I didn't understand what it was and dismissed it almost immediately. But a coworker convinced me to give it a second chance and a bit more time, and wow am I glad that I did.

It's like if you took Destiny, Diablo 3, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, Unreal Championship, and World of Warcraft and mashed them all together. Not to mention that it's probably the only F2P game in existence that actually does F2P correctly and ethically. And there's SO MUCH content here, I've put about 250 hours into the game and there's still plenty of things I haven't even seen or done yet. I've just barely scratched the surface.

If you don't like Looter Shooters or grindy games, you may not like Warframe, but it's free so you might as well download it and give it a try. The game also has a bit of a learning curve, you'll probably want to watch some beginner tutorials on YouTube (iFlynn and BBKDragoon are who I recommend). You'll also want to get familiar with the Wiki as soon as possible. But once you get the hang of it, it's amazing. It's truly unlike any game I've ever played.

And the devs actually listen to and care about their community. The Warframe community is completely unique. In an era where game devs and publishers are pushing as much greedy, anti-gamer/anti-consumer garbage as they possibly can, DigitalExtremes are truly a refreshing beacon of light.

Can't recommend this game enough. Go download it now.
Good game, steep learning curve. It's fun once you know your way around the 50 or so sub-systems (all which are dumped in front of you with zero explanation whatsoever)..

.. on the other hand, they've updated the early stages of the game, I've heard. So... meh..

Really though, this is the first game where you get tonnes of stuff for free, and your only reason (outside of being lazy) for buying microtransactions is because you want to support the game or the community artists. GG
An extremely solid cooperative shooter. If you can get past the weird art direction and lore of the Space Ninjas, this is an absolutely valid and free alternative to the Destiny and Anthems of the world.
The developers love and support this game.  They listen to the players, and when they make a mistake they own up to it, and they fix it.  This team gives me hope for the future of gaming.  I've never regretted a single hour in this game, it truly is a work of art, and a masterpiece 10/10.
From what I've seen, you will only really enjoy this game if you play a few hours, quit it, and then come back to it a few months later. Then you will be addicted.

100% free-to-play. Absolutely everything (except some cosmetics) can be obtained without paying. Waframe invites you to have a great time, and asks not for your wallet, but your time.
TWO WORDS, SPACE NINJAS

PROS-
Awesome community and the dev streams are worth a watch.
Tons of items and Warframes to farm which caters toward players who enjoy games like Destiny and looter games.
Impressive customization.
Stunning Visuals.
Stupendous and captivating story, PLAY THE SECOND DREAM!
Terrific sense of progression.
Frequently being updated and Warframe is constantly evolving.
There is always something to do, pretty much endless content.
Amazing gameplay and very fluid movement and parkour.
Hoverboards.
Space butts XD.

CONS-
Can be VERY overwhelming to newer players. I recommend watching IFlynn's Beginners guide, it can help a LOT. Note- the early game is being reworked sometime this year, to be less overwhelming and more beginner friendly.
Warframe can get a bit boring and has repetitive tile-sets, voice lines and missions.
TIME CONSUMING.

Also the Warframe wiki, USE IT!
I recommend 69/69 ign.
Warframe is one of my favorite games of all time, and has better quality than most $60+ games. The world is diverse, and has the entire solar system and more in it. The concepts are also great and the amount of content is amazing. Not only the content, but the mechanics work smoothly and are very fitting. It also helps that you can play alone or online with friends. 10/10, and the grinding elements add a whole dimension to it.
Great game but very confusing for a new player as myself. Had to watch heaps of videos to understand how to do this or that (could just be me) Only put about 17 hours in but so far so much to do which is great but also very overwhelming. Graphics are great and gameplay is too. Love how you can create your own warframe with mods to the style you like to play. Would highly recommend this to anyone who likes shooter games or likes to level up your character and see your progression. I don’t play too many games but this has got me a bit addicted once I understood what I had to do and how to do certain things, if your a new player like me I would say watch YouTube videos first to help you so you don’t quit straight away as it’s a great game ✌️
This game is free to play done right. This will go down in history as the free to play that makes triple A titles look bad. You could pay this game on a toaster with the highest graphics settings, the MOST OPTIMIZED GAME EVER. Endless amounts of content. If yuo are not playing this then you are missing out.
Forget Destiny and Anthem, Warframe is what you need!
Ninjas in space. Supersuits. Awesome weapons. A variety of customization options. SPACESHIPS *ahem* I mean, a comical, bipolar AI on the ship. A spaceship. Loads of enemies to shoot. You can be a ninja, using bows, swords and throwing knives, or be Rambo 2.0, using a machine gun, machine pistol and THICC hammer. Or whatever you want.
Do it.
Amazing game with amazing developers. The graphics are surreal, and the soundtrack is great too! Quests such as Second Dream and The War Within are phenomenal.

Easy one of the best free to play games ever.
I play this game from the beginning. I made some very long breaks and when I came back, there always were new things to do, more maps on different planets (even big maps more like open world), new weapons, so new reasons to farm hard. You can play alone or with mates. Personally, I like both, funny with people, but alone you can take your time to loot every corners of the maps (yeah, I’m an impulse looter).

This is an extremly fun game and i got hooked. I played it in a console before but i got further than i did on my console. Its fun but can get grindy at some parts looking for spacific recourcess. Its alot of fun to play with friends and progress through the game. I would recommend this game for people with alot of time or people who have nothing to do.
Warframe is a  game which has been regarded by many to be one of the greatest free to play games on the PC gaming market. From a perspective of someone who's played ever since the beginning of the release of Excalibur Prime, I have seen Warframe exceeding everyone's expectations with every new update. However despite it's many PROS there are still some CONS which are required to be addressed. 
Pros 
-The game is COMPLETELY free to play. Warframe requires a player to pay ABSOLUTELY nothing to gain an item within game. A player can obtain the same item from someone who has paid money from the trading market, such as gear, weapons, new frames. However this excludes items such as PRIME EXCLUSIVES which you to pay quite a bit of money.
-You can look good, design however you want, play however you want
-No pay to win aspect

Cons
-Extremely grindy. By this I mean EXTREMELY GRINDY, you could be doing something for hours and hours just to get resources in order to build a new item
-RNG to a certain extent. By this I mean, most of the gameplay relies on RNG, you could be doing the same mission for hours and still not get the drops you want
Ehh it’s kind of boring I said a while ago Then come 2019 I try it again


Holy shit why was Destiny or most games this good.

10/10 rdy to be addicted to something again. Thanks devs!
Best F2P game hands down. No pay to win scheming, no lootboxes, no BS. Just straight up space ninja's with crazy powers, with an extremely deep lore to boot. Can't get enough of this thing.
Really nice game, deserves way more attention! Regular updates, nice graphics, no pay2win, good story! ^^



PS just for Steam:

Why did Steam uninstall it?! I did literially NOTHING but to restart my PC and it was GONE!

[h1] About The Devs [/h1]
Tbh, they are the best devs i've ever seen in my entire life. They listen to the community, they make fun of their game and most importantly their first objective is not gaining money as much as they can.
But i have to be honest, chat moderators are not the best you can find. Here's an example: if you say [spoiler] [b] Nezha is a tr*p [/b] [/spoiler] you instantly get muted or even using the words nezha and trap in the same sentence you get muted.

[h1] About Game [/h1]
Like i said, this game is complete free2play. You can get anything you want by simply playing the game. Buying platinum with money only makes the process faster.
The game play is pretty simple but the modding system is pretty much the best. If you dont know what im talking about modding, its simply upgrading your weapon, character etc. You can make your own unique setup for any weapon you get!
Ofc there is meta but you dont have to obey it!
They add new prime packs and new warframes like every 3 months. [b]Prime: Upgraded and golden versions with black or white colors of weapons or warframes which get vaulted (not being able to get anymore) after 2 years.[/b]
Remember when i said its free2play? You can give your soul for ingame items!! Warframe is the defenition of Grind in the solar system! But dont fear friend! Sometimes it is easier to grind more than simply buying them with money.
All warframes (characters) are unique in their own way.
The game is a bit complicated at beginning because there are lots of things to do, but it gets simplier when you continue playing.
There is always new content getting updated! Not including the big updates like Fortuna or Eidolon, even a warframe can bring so much content with it! Like The Warframe called "Khora", she brought a whole new gamemode with her!
And if you have friends (which i highly doubt to) playing with friends is even better!

Anyway lets get to the point. I highly recommend you to play this game. You must experience the community, the gameplay, the lore behind it.

9/10 

[b] Would spin again [/b]
This game is a GRIND. I enjoyed the first 500 hours of this game, made it to Mastery Rank 18, and got all of the non-prime warframes. Afterwards, although the game is still enjoyable, it felt very repetitive and not fun to me anymore. Still recommend this game to people! Have fun with it!
for a game that's free, this game is revolutionary, even without microtransactions you can still make the in game money, by trading primes, which can be found everywhere, the grind can sometimes feel a bit repetitive but with the constant flow of new content to the game there is never nothing to do
This is one of the richest sci-fi shooters I have ever played! There is an abundance of content, customization, and story to experience and best of all its Free to Play without a pay to win feeling. This game is a must try!
Fun combat, cool customization, repetitive missions, painfully slow ranking up, too many annoying missions that are more work than play and not enough story. Too much of the game is the same tile sets over and over just with tougher enemies designed to make you think you're playing something new when you're really not. Planets on the side of the solar system that you start on have whole sections that are identical in appearance to planets that you unlock later in the game, they just have tougher enemies but it's effectively the exact same mission that you have already played. Requires hours of grinding, playing the same few defense type missions over and over to maximise the XP earned so that you can rank up your warframe and unlock higher end weapons. I was totally hooked on this game and put over 250 hours in until I eventually completed the whole solar system and the 10 or so main quests that can be done in the process. At this point there was not much left to do and I felt slightly cheated in that I had basically spent 200+ hours playing the same 5-10 missions over and over again over the course of nearly 100 locations (because so many locations are the same) just to unlock the quest missions. The quest missions are really fun and I can't fault them at all, they are one of the strongest points of the gameand more story missions are defenitely needed for this game. The 2 open world maps are also quite fun.  I was also quite happy to grind to get more gear and I even bought some of the premium gear that you can pay for. After the opening story mission you will probably put in hours into this to get anywhere even close to some backstory or plot again and I think that is bad. Also the payoff for the gameplay and hours of grinding needs to be something other than more hours of grinding. What kept me hooked on this and made me keep playing it was the hope of getting to the furthest planets and exploring them to see what sort of new landscape, missions and adventures you could have there and to discover more of the backstory to the characters and universe. The fact that when you get there eventually after hours of hard work you find out that they look the exact same and that the missions are the exact same (except for the fewstory quests) is really disappointing and it makes you wonder why you bothered. I think that a lot of the problem with this game is that it released a few years ago and has been updated massively since, the problem is that the old sections haven't been removed, just modified. This is especially evident in your first 20 or so hours of the game where you are essentially just playing the 2013 version of the game but slightly improved. The problem with this is that the new fancy and well designed stuff tends not to show up until later on. Both the open worlds are accessible early but you will be so low leveled and ill equipped that only one of them is any fun at all to play as a beginner.
If this sounds like a harsh review it is only because of how much I enjoyed the game while I felt like an interesting story and fun memorable battles and adventures were all ahead of me. I loved some of the characters and the quests, I just feel let down by it because of the over emphasis on grinding and the lack of emphasis on developing these story elements. There is so much potential for a star wars/star trek type universe here as it's filled with unique characters, awesome spaceships, futuristic warring human factions and evil bosses.......but the story missions that are there hardly even scratch the surface in comparison to it's true potential. Had the payoff for my time and effort in the game been a little more rewarding then this review would be overwhelmingly positive. If you like games that require grinding, ranking up, hours of repetitive gameplay and repeating the same missions and boss fights over and over then this is for you. If you like games that have a plot that drags you along and where the story is constantly advancing and where you feel your progression, time and choices being rewarded then you might need to look elsewhere.
I'm still a fan of this game overall though, the concept is too interesting and original and has too much potential for me to bash it. I would jump right back in to the game in a minute if there was even a little done to tackle the issues I've mentioned. You could say that I should just play a different game but my counter argument is that I know I'm not the only one who thinks this of the game and also, I really like this game it just doesn't put enough effort into the right areas in my opinion. I'll still play it because I like it, and I'll still recommend that you give it a chance especially because it is constantly being updated and things do change, I just don't like it nearly as much as I could if it was developed to it's full potential.

Basically a free overpowered Destiny on steroids. Destiny is trash compared to this game. Don't waste money on a trash game like Destiny just play this game instead.
Alright, this game may be somewhat pay-to-win; but, it is very easy to earn your way up the community and be LEAGUES better than those who have paid for platinum.

I give this game 5 out of 5 for the hard work put into it (though I experienced a glitch just last night, which was fine since it only lasted a couple seconds), and the voice acting is beyond what you'd expect.

Graphics quality is great for the type of game you're given and you can tell from a consumer's point of view that the models are very polished.

The game play is very nice, freeflowing ninja-esque fun! Stealth is achievable, but you can always go with the option of guns-blazing.

Overall the game is a great piece of technology at its finest, the community is always willing to help new players since its a challenge to even get good a the game and call yourself "an expert Tenno". If you're having thoughts of downloading this game, you really should, after all - it's free.
It's free and it's a good game overall. However, it's for a certain type of person: the addict. What do you do in this game? By the end of it, you are levelling guns and frames, and collecting rare mods, cosmetics, arcanes, rivens, etc. It's about collecting shit and having shit in your inventory for what end I don't know. It's a carefully constructed drip of exclusive shit for people who really have nothing going on in their lives and who aren't going to have anything going on in their lives other than Warframe. And I don't say any of that to be cruel. I myself slipped into this cycle but my world turned upside down and I was forced to realise that I was addicted to this game. It will dominate your time. It will consume your life. The devs have built it so that there are windows in which you can get extra this and that or special items or chances at legendary things--if you grind out that same near-meaningless daily content. I don't have time for this shit anymore, have hardly played in 3 weeks, and am not missing it at all. 

One can only feel sorry for the regulars who talk of being "burned out after 3000 hrs of playing" but are still asking others what they can still do in the game... Don't be like these people. Play through the solar system and walk away. All the content becomes the same very quickly. Always make sure your gaming is new and challenging. You should be building problem-solving skills and learning new things about the universe, not running on a hamster wheel. You can be a hamster or you can be a thinking being. It's your choice.
warframe is an excellent game got lots of in depth customization for your warframe your ship your pet and your guild dojo. they put alot of cool ideas together and controls start off alittle funky takes a lil bit to get used to but you will figure it out or it allows you to keybind certain keys hard to hit. but excellent game and the best part its free to play..
Best game on steam lol I love this shit so much 
From the gameplay to the graphics to the compatibility and the ability to customize ur warframe #fashionframe this game is the best amd that's just fax
The game is a huge scam, but you can get anything if you grind hard enough. Grinding is rewarding and game play is satisfying. Its easy to just play for hours given the alert systems and even though there are only roughly 10 give or take mission types the game has a good sense of variety given mission environments and enemy encounters. The upgrading system is a bit slow and takes time to get familiar with the mechanics that upgrade weapons and abilities. Most people just are impatient and spend money on platinum to get pretty cosmetics and high end weapons. There's nothing wrong with that, in fact the game sort of encourages this. It is a free to play looter shooter, and you don't actually have to pay money to win. you just have to play the game. And the game is a lot of fun.
So I decided to reinstall this game in 2019 after quitting World Of Warcraft and Overwatch. I must say I am in love with it. I created a new account, shoved 43 hours on it and im now Mastery Rank 6. Just subbed to Twitch Prime and retrieved the Trinity Prime Frame. I have spent countless hours grinding out ranks and resources for gear but I am enjoying it heavily every day where it will be gathering Endo for upgrading mods, applying new builds onto frames, building new weapons and frames, its just a blast to play. The only complaint I have is that going further into the solar system past Ceres starts to get real challenging and out of no where. I started Saturn thinking it will easy as previous planets but I was wrong, I spent the whole week making gear and preparing for Saturn and now I am on Uranus. Now ill probably be stuck on Uranus for a really long time lmfao but I have unlocked most of the areas that Void fissures spawn for Void Relics so I can achieve higher end loot at a higher mastery level.

It is a great game but grindy as hell and if you are thinking about starting this game then by all means download it and install it. Its fun to play solo and with friends but bare in mind that gathering resources, making gear and frames is time consuming. Very time consuming and if you dont have a massive amount of hours free to use up then you can get somewhere but slowly get there. The cool thing is that you can spend 2 hours gathering and then logging off when new gear is in progress at the work bench but to get mastery ranks faster you really need to rank everything up to 30 (weapons, frames, companions etc) if you really want the higher end weaponry faster.

Edit: I just completed most of the quests that I havent done yet and quests like The Second Dream has beautiful cinematic sequences and amazing lore to drive the experience even better than what I described.

With that being said, install it and gl hf.
Nothing much to say, only insanely underrated game,developers and comunity, no toxicity whatsoever, devs listening to comunity and such, overall huge recomendations for this game!
I had a lot of fun playing this game. the open world gameplay out out of this world(no pun intended) and even the individual levels have the uttermost care put into design. The game has many different types of levels, maps, and Cetus and Fortuna are outstandingly made. I hope that they keep adding more amazing features, maps, and more to the solar system. I give Warframe about a 4.5 star rating overall.
Good for those of us who like shooting and looting. Missions arent too hard, easy to repeat and farm. Pretty much like any mmo where you max out and just grind gear upgrades while waiting for the next story installment. Not the easiest when starting out but the community is nice. Careful in the region chat though, some drama went down and now it's easy to get banned for memes. :|
Easily one of my favorite games. The combat is fast-paced but manageable, the guns feel good and each one has a unique feel and sound, the melee weapons are fun to experiment with combos and such. Everything about the combat is just engaging and fun, you could zip around tearing into baddies for hours without getting bored. The progression is very addictive, too. Gather resources while playing, use those resources to craft gear, level that gear up while gathering more resources, rinse and repeat. 

The rank-up challenges are also a lot of fun, teaching skills and checking mastery of techniques to advance you to the next rank; ranks which allow for greater tiers of weapons and gear to be used. 

The item wheel is intuitive, the customization is fantastic, everything about this game is just great. And the best part is you can do pretty much anything in the game for free--microtransactions are either cosmetic or just time-savers. I don't play the PvP (nor does anyone else if my experience queuing is any indication) but it doesn't take anything away. You can be a full co-op player like me without missing out on really anything.

And the evolving story is fantastic. A very engaging narrative that makes you care about what you're doing in the solar system. Starts a bit slow, but if you stick with it you're going to have a game you'll love for years to come.

Highly recommend.
A prime example of what to expect from modern developers. Constantly getting updated with free content and giving you more reason to return to parkour and shoot. There is grind in the game, but its honestly not that bad and somehow the devs have turned grinding into a genuinely fun thing to do. Theres really no need to spend any money on it beyond supporting the developers or speed some things up. If you are new, you will have hundreds of hours to play before you reach the time where you have seen everything. And even then, theres plenty in the endgame to keep you busy until the next update. Its worth the try even if just for a free game. The community is very supportive to new players and you will undoubtedly meet a people you will end up calling friends.
My potato laptop can run this thing, plus its free. Don't spend your platinum on stupid things early on, although the 50 you do get can only be spent in the market. Buy blueprints to make new weapons/warframes/literally anything you might need. Grinder's paradise, doing the same thing over and over hasn't felt this good since Borderlands 2.

Can't wait to sink another 400 hours like I did on ps4.
played for 9 days in 2014, had no idea what I was doing and quite for 4 years. came back in February of 2018 did a few more things still meh but better, but then came back in January of this year and really racked up the hours in the game. its so much better than it was, there's an actual story (unfinished) in the game now. and there is now *somewhat* of a tutorial at the start of the game. being someone who started back when I really should have, but left it alone for years and came back now. I'm super impressed with how it's kept the quality it's always had, and looks like they don't have any lack of content to create for the future either. play this game if you love mmoefpsrpg games more often than not. I play it now because it's the closest thing to Firefall that doesn't shove microtransactions in you're face.
Its not easy to fins warframe on steam, it just leads me to fricking DLC's I had to ask my friend if he could send me a direct link to the store page. Fricking steam want's to deleit it's existance.
I honestly love the game. Has plenty to do for a while, but recent updates just feel like fillers. The lore is pretty good but could have been better. Overall worth a play, especially for free.
Needs more free starter packs like PSN. 

1. It is free to play

2. You play as a space ninja with an insane amount of weapons and gear. 

3. You do not have to pay $$$ for cosmetic items.. All in-game currency (Platinum) can be achieved through a smart grind.
 
4. Getting the cosmetic item feels soooo much better rather than just straight up wasting $$$ at it. 

5. Bugs are very scarce and if there is any bugs report to the developers. The more people talk about the same bug early on gets the attention of the devs and fixed even while you are in game(only for hotfixes)

6. Story is OK but not GREAT; however, it is fun to watch and interact with it.

7. The community is always helpful in explaining some aspects of the game the devs did not touch on much. 

8. Open-world servers are pretty stable on PC servers rather than console. 

9. Clans in this game honors the meaning of 'clan' having clannmates build projects together and add some items together in a pool. 

10. The only thing that truly turns me off in this game is the crafting time durations. However, the crafting system also helps prevent exploits of people making dupe accounts.

Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure. Tenno use the keys, but they are mere trespassers. Only I, Vor, know the true power of the Void. I was cut in half, destroyed, but through it's Janus Key, the Void called to me. It brought me here and here I was reborn. We cannot blame these creatures, they are being led by a false prophet, an impostor who knows not the secrets of the Void. Behold the Tenno, come to scavenge and desecrate this sacred realm. My brothers, did I not tell of this day? Did I not prophesize this moment? Now, I will stop them. Now I am changed, reborn through the energy of the Janus Key. Forever bound to the Void. Let it be known, if the Tenno want true salvation, they will lay down their arms, and wait for the baptism of my Janus key. It is time. I will teach these trespassers the redemptive power of my Janus key. They will learn it's simple truth. The Tenno are lost, and they will resist. But I, Vor, will cleanse this place of their impurity.
Technically the reason I gave this game a 2nd go is Rule 34. 
There are some pretty hot females here! 
And that with 3rd person view makes me very happy. (≡^∇^≡)
The game should have a faster download updates 
Most of all the game is good
Rookie might don’t know how to mod weapons/warframes/ Arch-wing / etc just watch some guide video and you will know how to mod
___________________________

Tons of content, from running missions of varying types(kill all enemies, defense, sabotage etc), to time limited missions with special awards, dailies, faction rewards, two open worlds, quests, loads of weapons, warframes to choose with varying abilites. Theres a lot to this game, its F2P, and admittedly a little grindy at first, but stick with it, its worth it,(and if you like it throw some money at the game to support the devs, they care about the game and player enjoyment, they took out a micro transaction because it was too unfair and unjust in their opinion, how many game companies do that these days?). The more you have in the game the easier it gets to get stuff. Remeber its an MMO style game, so it requires time, its mean to last for ages. and it has and will. Totally worth the effort. 

And its mostly PvE! Not only that, the lore basically states you're an OP space ninja, and the gameplay supports that, you will literally slaughter hordes of enemies as they frantically try and stop you. Afraid things will be to easy? Worry not, for those seeking difficulty this game has it too that'll require meta builds. And everywhere in between. From easy missions of swatting enemies, to moderate level difficulty requiring thought out movement and ability employment, to end game meta requiring meta builds.

My review is jumble, but this game really has it all. Its become one of my all time favorites.(started on PS4, migrated to PS4, both system combined im at like 500 hours)
thIS GAME. This game is amazing. Do you like Destiny? Well, here is where the got all their ideas. Do you like ninjas? Well, you get to be a boss space ninja. Do you like messing all the bad guys up cause you're a boss space ninja? Well, you get to.

Seriously though, this is a great game. Movement is fast and natural, firefights are intense, warframes and weapons are customizable. Just well done all around. Its like Destiny, but it actually has a story and you don't need to pay extra for the second half of the story.
Now I know what y'all are thinkin'
"Why is this dude giving WF a negative review? Despite it's pretty awesome gameplay and good replayability"
Well, I can say WF is a good game, it's really good, and I do recommend it above all else, but this is to be a wake up call, and a reminder to be cautious about sinking anything into this game

I spent a good maybe 100+ $ atleast and logged 243 hours into this game, enjoying all of what it had to offer to me, and one day, I can't logon amidst a growing problem, I read "negative plat balance" so I think weird, so I open up a support ticket asking what was going on and maybe see what I had done wrong, but a day later I realize what's up and add a comment onto my ticket stating that I knew what was going on and stated that it was being taken care of by the bank, I wait 8 or so weeks and see what they'd say, now keep in mind they technically can't take back content that's used within the game atleast from my understanding, so i'm left with a -4084 Plat balance which was accumulated by me purchasing the previous Prime Access *Chroma* and some other platinum bundles for more stuff within WF, so fast forward over to late January, I get an Email saying my tickets been responded to, I check it out.. I get the zendeskbot telling me the same crap I was told when I looked this problem up to investigate further about what it meant, and afterwards my ticket was closed.. and I just resigned myself from WF, my acc forever locked because -4084 plat translated over to real world currency is just 100+ USD for me to spend in order to get back in..

Now the takeaway: Warframe isn't a bad game by any means, it has its own lovely community, a tight knit thing of systems and mechanics, etc etc, but the only bad I got with it.. is the Customer Support, there have been some reviews complaining about it and it hasn't been solved from what I've heard.. so until this get's fixed, I have to leave this here so DE can open their eyes and get better at supporting a larger audience who may run into troubles like these.
The game is Great, but the game has a lot, and i mean A LOT GRINDING, i realy have fun playing it but sometimes i feel its waste of time, and i really dont understand whats the point of playing Warframe, if you do all the quests, all the mission, and you take the items you like, then what?, i mean when i was playing World of Warcraft if you take all the pvp gear then you have to find a team and rank up you elo, the Warframe pvp system is dead no one plays it, and sometimes when i log in in the game i really dont know what to do.
Review from someone who played this game a long time ago and couldn't get into it.

In short, three things made me abandon the game.
1- The rough learning curve and lack of guidance by the game. If you don't watch videos or read the wiki, you will have no idea what you are doing (when it comes to gear and crafting). After 15 hours of playtime, I still couldn't figure out how to acquire a new warframe. 
2- The missions feel like empty shells. While there is an external story that guides between missions, the missions themselves feel so "modular". Most of the maps I played have uninspired objectives that get really boring after doing them a couple of times. The missions have no soul/uniqueness to them. I think this is mostly due to the lack of meaningful interaction/characters inside the missions (don't know if that changes in future missions).
3- The grind. This game is filled to the brim with grind. The real problem for me is that sometimes I would get matched with people who have gear so good that I literally had to do nothing but watch. 

The main reason I personally don't like this game is because It is not a controlled cohesive experience. It is all over the place. Some people like the challenge of figuring out everything and grinding out the best gear. Personally I find that to be bad game design. After playing games with well-crafted experiences, I can't play games like Warframe anymore. Maybe I just don't like the genre.

I recently played the Anthem demo and while the story is mediocre, the missions felt dynamic, different and unique. Varying objectives and characters involved in the story made it enjoyable. Who knows? Maybe if I play Anthem more I would get quickly bored of it too.

Just my two cents.
No endgame, You can beat every single piece of content from mr8 (about 60h). This makes any form of grind absolutely pointless. Also the way you level up is very annoying basically forcing you to play low level content over and over again. Gameplay itself is smooth and fun at first but becomes repetitive and boring really fast. Also 90% of weapons are pointless to use since 99,9999% of time you are one shotting everything so any weapon worth using is biggest aoe ones. UI is awfull, mixing paid with already owned and not letting you customize it even a bit. I am not even going to get deep into the story cause you cannot get more generic than plot in this game gets.

Don't repeat my mistake and dont let this game suck you in cause there is literally NOTHING waiting for you at the end of the line. Aside from dissapointment
Can't recommend it after the Nightwave update. Alerts were replaced with a new system that's quite simply worse:
- nowhere near as rewarding for time spent
- takes away a list of missions for guaranteed squad play (worked like quickplay for all intents and prurposes)
- removal of alerts makes the world of warframe look dead between logins

Gameplay is still solid though and some later story missions are great.
Apparently linking certain items in the ingame chat gets you suspended. I have spent quiet a few hours in this game and although I do recommend this game, I'm leaving a negative review. I see no reason to be punished for linking certain ingame items just because people think it sounds offensive.

Temporary ban because of offensive behavior? - I'll gladly accept that.
Temporary ban because I missed a meme due to the fact that I didn't play the game at that time? - Certainly not acceptable. Sorry that I'm not a meme-lord.


Also closing a thread so I can't answer is pretty pathetic.
This game has become absolute convoluted garbage that increasingly only welcomes people who have nothing better to do than to do the same things they have done literally thousands of times before. If you have not been playing this game non-stop for years, dont bother. Its all grind. Everything in this game is grind. You can buy just about everything, but if you dont, prepare for the longest, most drawn out grind you have ever experienced. Everything good you might have heard about this game stopped applying around 2015. The open world content is meant for extremely experienced players with LOTS of time on their hands to grind. How do you get to the open world content? Grind there. How do you get around the open world content? Grind for a couple weeks to get the ability to grind a couple more weeks so you can fly around. If you have spent long enough playing the game to have a high enough level. 

The new nightwave content is nothing. Its a minute long radio "show" every couple months and then just a series of daillies and weekly grinds that have nothing to do with the radio show. Literally. Its a whole bunch of shiny nothing that they are so proud of. Things like "kill 500 enemies" award you a new currency that you can only spend in one spot, on time based items and at the end of that time period the items available as well as your unspent credits vanish. To warframe vets: Remember nitain extract? good luck getting it now, its even rarer and harder to get. Enjoy the extra grind!
good engine, awesome combat, graphics etc. big -rep tho, never played a game that required so much time wasted on grinding. if this was 10 years ago I would grind but its 2019 there are so many games out there that are great, i rather quit this game and go play metro, prey, borderlands.. it isn't a game changer that you would want to neglect all other games to play this. I rather waste time grinding in witcher3.
Many events and their special rewards are time sensitive and hyper-localized to individual stages.
Getting access to those stages often requires completing certain quest lines and increasing your mastery rank, which can take much longer than the event's window.
Completing quest lines involves playing a lot of different game modes, including ones you may not enjoy (in my case, it was "stealth & puzzle" stages).
Increasing your mastery rank involves playing with a lot of different gear, including ones you may not enjoy (in my case, it was the slow-firing high-damage weapons with small magazines and long reloads, meaning a lot of time being spent not shooting).  
I found I was spending a lot of time in modes I didn't enjoy with gear I didn't enjoy just to end up still too far away to earn the rewards.
That makes the grind feel like even more of a grind, and missing out on the time-sensitive rewards makes it feel extra non-rewarding.
Do you have a Job? A life? No Friends or Family? Lots of money? Do you Love RNG? 
Does a One Hit Death Make you moist? Enemies that Are nothing more than a bullet sponge?
Where as in  the NPC's Real difficulty comes from them just being High dps, or High HP pools?

Do you Just.... LOVE TO GRIND FOR HOURS, TO THE RNG GODS, JUST FOR THAT DARN MOD THAT WILL MAKE YOUR LIFE EASIER, BUT JUST TO NEVER GET IT! JUST TO LEARN A FRIEND GOT IT THE FIRST DARN TRY!!!!
Do you like a Meh stories? DO you just love NPC AI that makes you wish for a nuclear winter!
WAIT THREE DAYS FOR A FRAME, OR IN ONE CASE A WEEK! 

This game is just for you! 
TL;DR  I WANT MY LIFE BACK! :L

P:S This game will rob many hours of your life. It takes way to much time to get into unless you have friends, Or a big wallet.
But that's what a free to play game is. Wait for a platinum sale 75% off if you are lucky, and buy war frame slots. Unless you want to stand around in a market, or sell items online.

 Mainly I'm 50/50 on this game. I hate FTP game, and this game does not change my mind on it. It's still one of the better ones. But that doesn't save it.

 But I still hate the business model. If it wasn't for friends I would have never had played this game. So to those friends, If your reading this, I HATE YOU.... Intently.. :P Cause really... THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A FREE GAME! OH IT WILL COST SOME THING, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER! ALSO STFU ORDIS/LOTUS! Yeah Lotus I know how to do the darn missions!

I await the comments telling me how to play the game, and that I'm a salty, thirsty critter. XD
Moderators are typical run of the mill censor Nazis. 
They are now starting to remove negative posts on steam forums.
[list]
[*]Don't make jokes in chat, all the underage kids playing a M rated game with gore in it might take them the wrong way. Is this year of the Triggered?

[*]Don't bring up how Ember used to be a Male but DE decided to lop off his wang. To the crybabies: Your sexual identification issues are part of your own mental problems, not everyone elses like you make it out to be. Stop using your problem as a weapon against others.

[*]Don't talk like a real adult. Please only speak like everyone is a baby and stick to soft language. 

[*]Don't expect any warnings when you trigger one of the power abusing moderators. They instantly revoke access with no warning or information of the length.  

[*]You have to create a support ticket to get the information of your chat bans/ account bans. They don't even send you an E-mail. Talk about scumbags and shady practices.

[*]Like most developers they don't listen to Steam forums or feedback because again they are not real adults, only your typical scared of real feedback, can't read through the anger coming from the people who ENJOY THE GAME. Typically those who get the most mad are the ones who like the game the most and hate seeing scumbag sh!t like this...

The gameplay has gotten better over the years but they clearly like using old mobile game tactics like crafting timers with "premium currency" speed ups, paying for character/weapon/pet/archwing slots. They broke down and allowed trading of plat because otherwise this game would have died after year 2. 

Game seems to be a jumbled mess now. No sort of direction of what to do. 
No information on what is "end game". 
No sort of information of how to be able to deal with 100+ level enemies. 
Seems like only a handful of frames are worth using since they make the old frames utterly obsolete as well as boring in comparison. 
Same goes with weapons, use these handful of weapons because what is balancing? 

Riven mods are the stupidest thing... let's lock the thing that is actually useful for making weapons do ANY real damage behind Mastery Rank 18... *sarcasm* REAL GENIUS MOVE THERE. 
Not to mention there are three ranks you can't access because there isn't enough garbage in the game to level to reach those ranks... topped off with the absolute scammerific "vaulting" of items... 

Major memory leak issues with Orb Vallis and Fortuna. Devs don't have the foresight to return players to their originally selected NON BUSY hub but rather back into THE MOST LAG INDUCING, CLUSTER FKED HUB EVERYTIME. THANKS. Toss on crashing and super stuttering when return from Orb Vallis.

It's legit a great game itself but the way the developers had to stick with the mobile game mechanics is pathetic. Oh and none of their "poster girls" are good looking. They looks like 50 year old crows with too much w h o r e paint on their faces to cover up how fake they act on stream and how they hate the fact they have become objectified pushing this mediocre game.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This post seemed to have triggered the SJWs and soyboys of Warframe as they flagged my comment below on another post: 

What do you expect from developers who seem like they ran out of ideas after the 3rd year of the games existence? They are still using mobile game tactics as a key part of the game. They can't even get control of their own mental problems and are too busy focusing on things like preventing people from making jokes in chat, making sure their game is as convoluted with excess garbage to confuse new people into wasting platinum on things that can be unlocked with little to no effort, scumbag tactics like vaulting items creating fake urgency to buy them because kids will always drop money over effort. Oh and look at how the community makes way better and unique stuff than the people who make the game... that is kind of a sign.

Don't support pansy developers/mods and don't support soft language pushing mental patients.
-New gimmicks are introduced to only be forgotten about entirely. It's the staple of this game.
-Non stop power creep.
-Convoluted changes/updates for existing content. Balance is clearly not of the highest priorities.




How DE manages to break systems as trivial as waymarkers is beyond me, they have worked since closed beta and now they are broken with various other trivial things you can just smash your face on the table for.
Windows 10
Intel core I7
Integrated Video card that supports DirectX 10.1
8 Gigabytes of RAM

The game now freezes 1 minute when load, then you're kicked from your party...

You left us behind, 1200hs i spent in this game helping new players, trading, playing... now what?
Pros: 
~Great Game.
~Great Graphics.

Cons: 
~You'll get banned for basically anything.
~Company charges college tuition rates for it's in game currency.
~Unlocking any sort of gameplay requires a 9-5 commitment.
~Wait times similar to those F2P apps on your iPhone.
~You'll get banned for basically anything.


Was banned October 2017 after a Riven mod trade to a player in exchange for platinum.
Reason listed as chargeback of platinum purchase/purchase from 3rd party seller.
Platinum balance reduced to -2750. About $160 USD.
Support states there's nothing they can do and I have to pay $160 to unlock my account.

My account is being held hostage by a company in exchange for a $160 payment for a chargeback of platinum that did not originally belong to me. 

EA? Is that you?



its a great game really is its absolutley amazing if i could play it every time i install it ask me to download direct x so i give it permission it crashes then absolutley f*** my pc ive had to factory reset 3 times because it wouldnt  download direct x and my pc is good enough to run it i played until howl of the kubrow then it crashed and everything in game was bright pink it even made my discord glitch i have screen shots its a great game i wish i could play it
This is the game for you if;
1. You enjoy waiting 12+hrs for an upgrade or weapon to craft
2. You enjoy randoms joining your group and making you incapable of continuing
3. You enjoy a grind comparable to OSRS
4. You don't enjoy good gunplay
5. You want to jump around like a coked-up kangaroo while shooting poorly-designed weapons.

Yes I know it's free-to-play and they have to make money somewhere, but within 10min of starting to play the game had already directed me to the cash shop and shoved upgrade timers (and paying real money to reduce those) in my face. I'm not one to shy away from microtransaction-funded games, but games that force a long wait time and then pester you to pay real money currency to speed it up will absolutely drive me away the moment I see them. This kind of mechanic belongs in F2P mobile games, nowhere else, especially not a 'fast-paced shooter' where your progression is marked by your items and equipment. When such things can take 12-72hrs to craft, it loses all sense of being 'fast.'
great game, horrible devs. they make the drop rates so you end up giving up and spending money cause you have run the same missions 100 times with that same 3 loot drops.
EVERYTHING is over priced and EVERYTHING take way to long to grind^

as far as the game itself, graphics are great, gameplay is smooth, missions are fun (for awhile become boring as there is very few game modes)

community can be decent, but most are full of self centered asshats who dont care what your trying to get. 

if you dont mind grinding your life away for 1 part (like khora) and dont care about ignorant people, this game is just for you!
Honestly warframe is boring . its always get this Defend that kill this type of enemy 10000 times. And just bored of killing the same types of enemys over and over again. And the level design is just repeating. The same level in a different planet. And just sick of always sliding and jumping sliding and jumping all the time every level just to get somewhere. And if you dont pay for in game money it will be pain to get weapons and new characters ONLY through trading and such. and you cant get most of the stuff in gameplay. That what made ME leave this game. Just the repetitive nature of it.﻿
Though the game itself is okay, I can't recommend this game because I've had all in-game communication suspended twice on my account from chat moderators. I will not support this game.
They ban paying customers for no reason and then do not respond. This game is a trap. Just play PoE instead.

Not to mention their archaic netcode that requires you to become a tech expert and customer service is just as useless on that as well.
Great game, good variety and story, engaging combat and activities.
Community is good, people who "moderate" the community are in a position that really shouldn't exist and complicates things when someone is targeted for whatever reason.
otherwise gr8 solo experience if you never have those kinds of issues because you are an actual ninja and never talk.
I would love to play, but all of my data is on PS4, and it doesn't seem like account sync is going to be an available option anytime soon. If you play on console, do not think you can keep your progress on other platforms! 

Call me when another account transfer/migration is available...
Fun for 2 hours then it becomes stale. Also they try to make you buy their crappy premium currency every 2 seconds. You cant do much unless you buy it or farm the same stupid levels for hundreds of hours. What a joke of a trash game.
This is a highly complex game with dozens of hidden mechanics but nothing is explained. You have to sit and play detective just to complete missions. Absolutely terrible, a waste of time.
Fight the same enemies in the same locations over and over and over again with no deviation from that pattern, the crafting system is broken as well. The process of trying to get a new frame goes like this: Grind to unlock the planet that the blueprint for parts for said frame is on, then grind for the blueprints for the parts (Which takes a couple days at least) then find the grind for the stuff to build the parts (Each part takes 12 hours AT LEAST to craft and there are 3 parts to each frame with an amount of a set resource) grinding for the stuff to craft the parts can take a couple days as well. Then, finally craft the Frame itself which takes 3 days. Ooooooooor, you could skip all of that, and just pay real money for platinum so you can buy the warframe instantly with no grinding!
On one hand, I wanted to enjoy and love this game for all it's worth.

The other hand, everything else about it, repels me from wanting to enjoy it. I'm talking about it's business model and that model is F2P. It feels like the only way you'd ever find fun in a game like this, is to have your credit card ready and be prepared to pay. I mean, it costs $16 to change your name. To change. Your name. I could get a $20 Steam card, wait until the Summer sale and spend up to $20 of FULL games that'll be eons worth it if I hadn't chose, instead, to change my name on this game.

It plays fine and looks fine. However, that doesn't give me enough of an excuse to pass it by from the amount of expectancy this game puts before you, to pay up for something. Otherwise, I'd imagine the grinding in this game must be incredibly tedious. The prices in-game can equal to the amount you'd pay for a full $60 game, it's that bad. I would've rather this game instead have been a fully priced game, have it's DLC and be like that. Any game, to me, that is stamped with F2P, has so many red flags going for it. I'm almost afraid that the next F2P game that comes out, I'm going to need to pay something to even launch the damn thing.

For what it is, it's just your run of the mill huge multiplayer game with lots of grinding, stuff to do and crap to pay IRL money on. Not for me.
I give this game a No in my opinion. Honestly yes everything is great the story, characters, atmosphere, etc but one thing I doesn't tick my box, its how in the first 2 hours of Gameplay my friends told me "If you dont like to grind or doing repetitive missions to make various blueprints and items, then this may not be the game for you" this game didn't get me really invested in the story or gameplay, for me it felt boring, next to Destiny (Which was extremely disappointing and a P2W experiences made by Activision) I would give this game a second chances because I was only just 2 hours into the game but honestly I wasn't buying into this grind, repetitive gameplay. Yes Its different, its not a shitty Battle-Royale. But I felt this as another Destiny sadly. Dont let this garbage review let you not playing this game, everything about this game is a really good but for me it failed to soon it just doesn't take the cake for me.
[TL;DR The game is fun when it works, but the money grubbing tactics coupled with poor support, and constant glitches means you should probably never give them money for their behavior... Unless you get off on Russian Roulette Gambling.] 
 Players beware! Game is fun, good looking, and the community is at least 40% nice helpful players. But it's broken. Constantly. Couldn't even finish the Halloween event because they couldn't stop the enemy from getting stuck in textures where you cant get him 90% of the time. Play at your own risk and do not EVER purchase platinum [even their endorsed and partnered twitch-streamers tell you this]. IF YOU DARE buy it with a 75% off log in bonus, BUT you are still gambling on getting locked out of your account because of poor CS tech management or payment issues. If there is a banking issue, and you wind up with plat in the negative you will be locked out from your account, it will likely take month[s] for support to get back to you, and they will still likely tell you to buy plat [bribe them] to fix their fuçxups. Cash shop weapons can't be locked so you don't accidentally sell/lose, and are not bound to account so even they go missing randomly at load screens [you WILL be blamed for selling it no matter what, and sometimes plat items take their slots WITH them, causing support to tell you to buy more plat and get it again!]. Mission rewards also don't get credited 100%. Take screenshots of inventory and collectibles, because server connection issues lose your data all the time. Oh, and if you don't go out of your way to document and record every mission with something like shadowplay or twitch, or at least a post mission summary screenshot, they will not help because, you are "lying without evidence" as far as the support is concerned, even with other witnesses in clan/party providing their own proof. At least some of my issues seem to me to be embedded in my account; Game dialogue just does not play for me half the time only on my main login. However no support agent even acknowledged or tried to check if its a possibility. Seeing as I can't complete things successfully or enjoy playing with friends, most players in chat say the solutions to most glitches are "just do it solo". Which isn't always possible, skill/level/party are sometimes a factor in an MMO mission..
  Myself and others have quit playing because CS doesn't help normal paying customers, let alone founders, with game breaking problems. I personally unknowingly went without half the the game audio for my whole playthrough, I was unaware until I heard my FRIENDS game audio playing post mission in ship, through discord right before I finished the war within. It didn't work properly on any PC I tested that account on, but other accounts played ship/mission dialogue fine, however; The only solutions I received from support were send log files repeatedly, integrity check, /reinstalls to multiple drives that did nothing, so the last solution they had was "Just play on your other account that works, or play all the missions over again and hope it works this time". Okay so my efforts and account bonus collectibles on my ship/warframe are just voided that easy huh? The final straw for me was when THEY made a mistake because of their servers lagging, and sold me two 75% plat discounts [I was gonna buy a mag prime pack so it would've been fine to let it slide and hunted the parts down], BUT because the laggy order got through after a not laggy one, instead of making an attempt in helping my actual problems that i wasted months of time putting tickets and money on, they revoked it ASAP, less than 12hr so THEY wouldn't lose out on profit, leaving me out to dry after spending almost 3 months going back and fourth wasting my time and money, while they tie up my funds for weeks in returns and ruin any desire I had left to play by taking my plat back forcibly when I wanted to let them keep the money at that point.
I even have almost a half dozen new Warframes & weapons already crafted, ready and unlocked, but can't stomach the idea of logging in to play anymore. I am an RPG driven gamer. Their support has ruined any desire I have left to play since i apparently got less than half of the RPG story and just chugged through the missions with clan having less fun than everyone else, dragged around like a cat on a leash, not knowing what we were there for or what to do without game dialogue. I am depressed that I'm taking others who were enjoying it with me, because they don't wanna play this anymore without me. Aside from my weird account audio issues, as a cherry on top, my friends and clannies've got a lot of the same problems and then some of their own... 
Sorry fans, I really want to like the game and keep playing but...
I'm. Just. Done.
Sh!t grindfest that constantly shoves plat into your face when you don't buy it and even when you do.

It HEAVILY pushes to you that plat is downright REQUIRED if you wanna do anything at all with any sense of speed or less time.

Don't care if you're a incel neckbeard fanboy, not changing my review because "you don't like it".
It's either a pay to play game or a no-life game where you have to farm for 24 hours to get a weapon don't get me wrong it's a good game but once you get to a certain point you have to get a guild if I'm correct but you have to buy it because I am not farming for 1 month over it and you can't continue the story without getting a key to your guild.
- Its pointless, the game has no goal. If u want to collect it all, surprise, you cant. There are cosmetic items locked behind unreasonable paywalls.
- The developers make everything up as they go, which is sometimes a good thing but most of the time they forget what they did before and introduce inconsistancies. To be fair, they listen to the community feedback, but sometimes the community doesnt know what it wants.
- Its getting populated more and more by sjw moderators.
- The open world maps include extreme grind and the most boring and repetitive missions to boot.
- Archwing and operator modes force gameplay that you never wanted upon you. Including bad customization and annoying voice lines.
- Getting matched with META players assures death for your braincells.
- The game features 3 defend the objective modes, 2 kill the objective modes, and 2 press a button objectives. And a survival mode that makes absolutely no sence.
- All bosses have invulnerability phases to counter bad damage balancing. 
- Half of the warframes are in need of a rework to be able to compete with the newer aditions.

- Invest your time in something more useful.
Never been a fan of the "loot and scoot" quasi pseudo-MMO genre, the Destiny's, Warframe's, Anthems of the world. Nah, not a Warframe guy. Never could get into it, the story is retarded, and the general premise is retarded.
Absolutely fucking obnoxious. Everything about this game is overshadowed by the pathetic microtransaction model. 

I really don't understand the dumb idea behind "release a platform, and make it as boring as possible in hopes somebody will pay to make it better". Seriously, fuck you and your microtransactions. Unless you pay a ridiculous amount of money, the game is a stripped down, utterly boring third person shooter with gimmicky movement and classes. Don't listen to the nonsense about being able to unlock everything on your own. While technically true, the game felt repetitive and obviously tilted towards microtransactions in less than 2 hours.

"How can the devs eat if they don't get paid?" -- How about release a good game worth paying for up front, and not trying to fleece your customers for every last dollar you can. Furthermore, it's shallow J-style gameplay, which means it's comic-animation book corny, dodge heavy, seizure inducing, and utterly shallow. Another pathetic attempt to be a thinly veiled video game slot machine. This game is a waste of time and hard disk space.
Pay to win, bad graphics/gameplay/UI, third person, and terribly grindy-repetitive according to people who played it for a long time...At least it's not marketed still as a shooter.
Too bad this is the standard for f2p games nowadays, with very few exceptions :(
Can't really bother to write a proper review for this.
You should get Destiny 1, or 2, not this. You might be saying that oh, but Warframe is free. Well, its a p2w. You would rather spend that money on Destiny 1, or 2.
"Warframe is entirely free-to-play"
long story short: there are premium credits you have to buy with real money and are used frequently to buy in game items
