We were losing,so I said "Lets pull a France and Surrender". The next guy said that we should pull an Italy and switch sides.Then another guy said "No,Lets pull a Russia and suck for most of the War but make an epic comeback". We only had one base left and within 2 minutes we had all of them.What a comeback.

8.3/10 it keeps historical jokes alive.
I tried Day of Defeat: Source again recently and was expecting it to be dead. After all, the game is almost a decade old now. However, I was still able to find several populated servers at all hours of the day or night.  Old age hasn’t killed DOD:S.

If anything age has worked in DOD:S’s favor. For example, it attracts an older and more mature crowd. I haven’t had to put up with as much drama or slurs from annoying prepubescent teammates as I do in more modern multiplayer shooters. 

Another example of age helping the DOD:S experience is how “old school” it feels. Despite the WW2 setting, DOD:S plays more like an arena shooter from the 1990s than today’s super serious military shooters. Forget aiming down iron sights. Secondary fire for most weapons throws solid punch instead. Expect to spend a lot of time zipping about, shooting dudes with crosshairs, punching them for good measure, and laughing at the exaggerated ragdoll physics. 

Day of Defeat: Source is not a masterpiece but it’s worth a look if you have a hankering for a shooter that isn’t too serious.

Day of Defeat Source is one of the better WWII titles on the market.  It is aging now, being from the HL2 era, but with a small market for WWII games there aren’t a lot of options.  The multiplayer format is good, using a capture point system.  The weaponry and combat is excellent, and holds up well.

-RUSHING PRIVATE RYAN-

We set out in the morning, warily checking windows, corners, anywhere the Germans could spring a trap or an ambush.  

Johannson was in the lead, Garand at the ready and bayonet fixed improperly.  Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before.  I was in the middle with Peters, helping him carry the M2 Browning.  And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.

It was quiet.  Too quiet.

The bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.

The sound started as a low rumble.  We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking.  It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling.  We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.

But nothing could prepare us for what happened next.

A giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.

We opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.

Stewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson.  He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels.  

One of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind.  They never saw it coming.

By now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his MG wildly at the advancing tide while I threw frag grenade after frag grenade.  And then Peters started to run out of ammo.

Quickly, I rushed up to his position with a new box of ammunition, but by that time they were almost upon him.  Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.

I was cornered, back against a locked door while I blasted soldier after soldier back with my Sniper rifle.  But it was no use.  They descended upon me, swinging shovels indiscriminately at my already bruised and battered body.  They were relentless, beating me until at last, I succumbed to the darkness.

As my vision blurred, they stopped screaming long enough for one of them to say something to me.

Something that would shock me to the core.

Before the zeitgeist of perks, leveling and killstreaks consumed the multiplayer shooter market, Valve released an updated version of a successful team based World War 2 Half Life mod on their brand new engine and dubbed it Day of Defeat Source. Released in 2005, Day of Defeat was rooted in another industry fad—the world war 2 shooter. In the same year, Medal of Honor European Assault, Call of Duty 2, Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 and it's sequel Earned in Blood were all released. While the former games were largely single player story driven affairs, Day of Defeat Source was strictly a team based multiplayer game that distinguished itself by being extraordinarily balanced and offering phenomenal map design. 
	
Players can enlist with either the U.S. Army or the German Wehrmacht and skirmish over capture points or attempt to arm bombs on strategic assets. Each side has six classes that utilize historic weaponry and almost every weapon sets itself apart from the opposite side's equivalent in some way. While the German's Mauser K98 is a single shot bolt action weapon that fires slower than the clip fed semi automatic Garand that the U.S. Army's rifleman class uses, it's also more powerful. Similarly, the Mauser M712 side arm carried by the German Panzerfaust units chews through enemies at close range but the M1 Carbine used by U.S. Rocket troops is far more versatile being semi automatic and highly effective at medium range. With these differences, players often built an allegiance to one army versus another based on their weapon preferences. 
	
Each class also featured a set of quirks that required a bit of practice to master. Machine gunners couldn't effectively kill an enemy unless their gun was mounted, the recoil on these weapons is violent enough to have players staring at the sky box after pulling the trigger. This means that machine gunners are largely a defensive class along with snipers who are hopeless in mid range combat. The assault class utilizes early assault rifles which suffer from heavy recoil and are most effective when fired from a crouched position. Newcomers often favor the support class since their sub machine guns allow the kind of fast moving spray and pray tactics that modern shooter fans are accustomed to but the power and accuracy of rifle troops makes them easy prey at medium to long range where their automatic weapons are almost impotent. While it may be tempting to walk around with a rocket launcher, attempting to aim while moving is incredibly slow making players huge targets. These major differences in the play styles between classes make the experience rewarding and, in some cases, polarizing. 
	
The six official maps offered with the game prove to be masterclasses of map design. In addition to the main lanes that take players to each objective, there are side routes that allow players to flank opponents and remove pesky snipers and machine gunners. Maps that are won by capturing all the territories feature a central capture point that requires at least two teammates to capture meaning it's impossible to go lone wolf and win a game. Uncoordinated teams will often find themselves entrenched in a bitter stalemate over these points—especially on Flash which is the most linear map of the bunch. Coordinating your teams efforts and making a big push toward an objective on multiple fronts often yields victory. It's a far cry from the lack of teamwork required by many modern shooter games. While six maps is a bit disappointing the community has stepped in to pad the play-list with hundreds of custom maps.
	
Valve has continued to support Day of Defeat Source over the years, updating the game to include achievements and trading cards. It's mechanics are almost unrivaled almost a decade after release, in spite of the fact that the popularity of first person shooters has never abated. The aging visuals do little to hamper the thrill of rushing capture points and there are few things more satisfying than putting a bullet in an opponent's head while on the move with a K98. It's a shame that more shooters don't require the skill and cooperation demanded by Day of Defeat Source.
Just going through the server browser and seeing all the gaming "clans" was a trip. Here I thought gaming clans were completely extinct by now but sure enough the only populated servers on this game are owned and populated by clans. This was a heartwarming blast from the past; even if I did find out later that the age demographic for clans has somewhat changed from when I was playing CoD from 2006-2014 on console. 
So I ended up joining a server with a bunch people who I learned were all 30-40 year old ex-military guys. I didn't talk much and decided I'd just learn how the game works and listen to them have their conversations. They all knew each other on a first name basis and talked about gun control, the guns they own, the guns they want, the "problem" with this country, their ex-wives, millennials, border patrol, and they shared a few jokes that you wouldn't repeat in mixed company. I played for a couple hours and started to get a hang of how the game worked then got kicked for going 40-10.
The game itself is OK. The gameplay isn't going to knock your socks off or anything. But the community is something to behold and I recommend everyone tries being a fly on the wall on some of these clan servers. And if you're a divorced ex-military republican guy looking for like-minded friends then look no further.
I played this game alot after i realised that i got it with the Valve source cd game, and i loved it almost immediatley after the really good player who made me rage left the server. But i always play this when it's christmas,
The reason is that when i first discoverd this game i was sneaking up to play it at night, and thoose nights when i sat there shooting nazis, or mauling the muricans' with the oh so trustworthy shovel. I was accompanied by the warm glow from the lights in the christmas tree who stood in the room with me. And i hope i will never forget how that felt, and how i gleefully slept through the day. 

This feeling will always stay with me, as it comes back to me every christmas when i return to this game silently in the night sitting down to paly this game, in the company of the warm glow of christmas lights. Feeling like the thirteen year old boy i once was. And gleefully forgetting the troubles of adulthood at the moment the title screen pops up on the monitor.
THIS GAME IS AMAZING!

+Class-Based Units.
+Multiple game Modes.
+WWII Setting.
+Overpowered Pistols.

THIS GAME HAS IT ALL!!!

Except... Not may players... Maybe a good 500 people.

Its still a fun game though. 

8 / 10
I've been playing DOD since the mod first came out. I've got hundreds of hours of enjoyment out of the game as I've always been a fan of the WWII genre. It's always been my go to and lately the gungame mod has been my favorite form of deathmatch style multiplayer!
Very well excecuted game. If you do join a server by the name of DevilDogs, leave. They are a bunch of old fogeys that like to control what classes you can and cannot play.
You aren't a bullet sponge in this game. Few meatshots will kill you. When you finally get a killstreak going you feel fucking invincible. Then you die. I love it.
The first hour I played this, I can remember it clearly. Can't remember which map, but I remember speaking to some people on the server I was on. It was late, it was about 11 PM. I was about 11 too. I could understand english and say simple things,, ask for stuff, whatever. I sucked. I got 10 kills. Or less. But each kill made me confident and then I'd get killed immediately. I was sad and said with my young voice, on an american server, "please, I want to get good". NOW, hold on. There were already people talking on the server, casually. But they all stopped for a moment and silence came. I think anxiety hit me, and I thought that I'd get kicked. But then... "Again please?" said by a russian dude. I said it then, and the rest then proceeded onto laughing, they didn't bully me, don't know why they were laughing, but felt like they were laughing at something else, and not me. One of the top players on the other team then said that "Don't aim on the ground, aim over the hip, always have your crosshair close to the corner and always ask yourself where your enemies could be." - Nah just kidding, he said "practise, boy, practise." And then the casualtalk started again, slowly I faded away, no one noticed me anymore. Of course there was this one person trying to gain attention by writing shit to me in the chat. But I didn't mind. I then got a sniper, and then went into a clocktower. There I waited looked out, scoped, shot. And a kill I got. While I did that, the topfragger, the topscore on the other team was talking about something that had happened at his work, but I killed him, and for the first time he stopped talking. He said "Damn, that was a mistake, good kill!" and then proceeded to laugh and then kept talking about his story. 2 minutes after that happened, I decided to say thanks, and I did. He just laughed and said "No problem!" we then talked for awhile. He told me how to get better. But I didn't understand a thing. And my internet cut off. It usually did that back then. I didn't even get to add him. I then tried to find the server, found nothing, couldn't remember his name. Haven't opened the game since, or maybe I have. I'm not sad when I think about it, I'm just happy. 

10/10
This game is good.

There are few who still play this game however. The last few regulars are men in thier 40s and 50s.

They all know each other by name. Each night they huddle on a handful of community servers, unwilling to move on to the next fps.
Day of Defeat: Source was, just like Counter-Strike: Source, an update to Valve's new Source engine. I'm not aware at all of how the original Day of Defeat fared, as I never played it, therefore I can't make a proper comparison between the two.

What I can talk about though, is obviously Day of Defeat: Source, having played it quite a bit and having fun with it. The game is set in WW2, and while a lot of games are set in WW2, nowadays with the massive trend of current and near future FPSes lately, it is remarkably a refreshing change.

Source obviously made the maps and models look much better than the original game. They still hold up quite well nowadays, much like Source itself in any case, so for most people there won't be much of a problem when it comes to graphical fidelity.

While I don't know how the gameplay in the original DoD was like, if it was anything like CS 1.6 to CS: Source, it may have ruffled a few feathers on the original DoD community upon DoD: Source's release. Or maybe it didn't, because of the gameplay.

The gameplay is most definitely this game's strong point by a long shot. There are several classes to pick from, varied enough to justify their presence in the game, and fully suit the setting, just like the various weapons you have. The shooting feels good, just like most of the FPSes in Source.

Unfortunately, it suffers from not having a whole lot of variety to it, both in game modes and in maps. And by now, there are naturally also other FPSes set in WW2 that feel and play a lot better than DoD: Source. There's still a community present, so you should have no difficulties jumping into a multiplayer game however.

I would get this game. It's cheap and can be an enjoyable and refreshing game experience once in a while. Plus it's a Valve game, and those come with a lot of obvious perks. (Garry's Mod models being an example) Just don't expect too much out of it.
Joined a pub, overheard a conversation between two army veterans in Maine who wanted to meet up for a beer, kept playing.

This game's a diamond in the rough, especially with player numbers being awfully low, but if you can find the right 60 year old dudes named John to play it with, its kind of a blast.
The typical Source classic, the only World War 2 first person shooter game made by Valve.

This game is old, outdated, abandoned by Valve and obviously can't be compared to the modern FPS games. But despite the old graphics and funny animations, there is something special about this game - the gameplay.

DoD:S gameplay is focused on tactic. It's the exact opposite of Call of Duty, Battlefield and games like that. The recoil is pretty big and unforgivable, players have to cooperate and carefully move around the map. It's usually impossible to run over a street without smoke grenades or using cover. One or two hits mean instant death. This type of gameplay probably reminds you Insurgency or Day of Infamy - sure, they are both unofficial spiritual successors to this game, at least Day of Infamy is definitely inspired by this game although DoD:S remains more open to new players and less hardcore.

At first I didn't even know if it makes sense to post a review of this game after all these years. Then I saw a gameplay video from the new Call of Duty and it was so childish and stupid that I actually learned to appreciate games like DoD:S more. Then I thought there might be still people looking for a WW2 shooter made for people with IQ over 50.

I'd recommend to buy Day of Infamy instead because it's in my opinion the better and newer (even actively supported) game but DoD:S still has its own style so if you don't care about money and want to expand your collection of WW2 games or if you are simply a person who enjoys/wants all Valve games, this may still be an interesting game, even in 2018. And yes, it's multiplayer-only of course. No single-player mode at all. The community is still alive and host dedicated servers.
Don't even think about playing this game with a controller, it requires mouse for precise and fast reactions.

What I like about this game is that there's no cosmetics, crates, keys, leveling up, competitive rank, blah blah blah, it's just a game. The reward for playing the game is having fun.
A good steam game from Valve, good graphics with simple weapons from World War II that provides a sense you are at war. No extra special developed weapons here, pure and simple concept with the usual good old warfare. One of the games I've ever played where teamwork provides the best opportunities to win positions and rounds.
Bought this game in 2005 and I'm still playing regularly in 2018!  

How about a re-boot Valve?  There's still money to be made on this title with a relaunch, as you've nailed it with the shooting mechanics, and that's worth its weight in gold!  The game dynamics and gunplay is still better than the latest AAA release (BF V)!
A near classical beauty.

Pros:
-Good ol' source engine. (a potato can run this well)
-Still lots of people playing.
-NOT CoD ghosts.
-Just entered a server and got myself sniped instantly.

Cons:
-Lack of variety of weapons.
-Outdated graphics.
-Only 5 classes. it could use more.
-Old CoD games make this one look like complete shit.

This is certainly a fine piece of art by Valve. I will enjoy this game for a very long time 9.3/10
Most awesome game ever! I've been playing this from 2006 and still coming back to it despite owning triple A modern games. This is a fast paced no nonsence skillbased shooter guys!
It's still to me, 12 years on, the most well balanced, well designed, fun and frenetic multiplayer arena shooter out there. It's not quite as superb as the original (took out the British faction and a load of weapons i.e. the monstrous FG42) but it's damn close.

No problem finding populated servers.

DLC free, microtransaction free and community lead. Gaming when it was at its very best.
This is a good fun world war game, with a feeling of Medal of Honor and basic Valve physics (Jump crouch and somehow you go higher)

Because all the old Medal Of Honor games are pretty much dead this is the next one along, and this game is good fun.

I wish they would make a number two of Day Of Defeat.

I loved Medal Of Honor Spearhead, and this game feels like that just has players init that is playing.

Great game, great fun and worth the money and time to play.

Graphics: The graphics are simple Valve game graphics with nothing special to look at, but smooth and simple to handle for any PC. (All Valve games look the same I noticed)

Audio: The audio is the same as above, same sound clips in one with the added old style shooting weapons. 

Controls: The controls are the same as other Valve games, all the same silly jump and crouch mechanics and super easy to get used too. 

Would I recommend the game? Hell yes it's so much fun to play with teams and more fun with friends.
the first game i played was pong and when i was a teen i did the arcade thing at 5j's. I have had sega master system, nintendo, PS 1, 2, 3, X box and for the last 8 years DODs is pretty much the only game I ahve interacted with. BEST GAME EVER> Same map 100 times and it is always diffrent the conmunity is the best and the Blitz krieg whores server is top notch....
Edited 11/23/2018...Still the go to game adn the WHORES are still strong after 13 years theere have been a lot of players come and go, they always return. the community has changed emensly over the years...Well its 2019 not playing the same due to operation on my hands. 20+ hrs. the game remains the same the players have changed...

It's about 10 years that I've bought this game and no matter what, I keep coming back to this fps 2nd WW gem.
Even if I haven't played it a couple of years every now and then it still manages to draw me right back in. 

If you fancy yourself a break from toxic pre-teens doing nasty stuff with your mum, get DoD:s.
If you are expecting a fast-paced shooter, then you're looking at the wrong game. This game requires patience and a hell of an eye if you want to be good. Do not expect that running around, guns blazing, will get you far. In fact, it will get you nowhere. Bullets are lethal, and you will die, over and over if you do not stay still, silent, and quietly pinpoint an enemy as soon as they are within your sight. I personally found it too difficult, but that doesn't mean it's bad.If you want a realistic battlefield, then I recommend it.
Do you love capturing flags and playing with middle age yankees escaping their horrible lives and families by recreating their war fantasies?

If yes, then you will love DoD:S!
Community is weird and some of them take the game in an almost a role-play kind of seriousness, but it honestly just adds to the fun. It has lots of great maps and game modes, fun mods and player made stuff as well. Highly reccomend this game.
This is the perfect game to chill to after work. Just hop on a server, kill a few people and log off. Mostly mature gamers on servers which is very nice.
Pros:

-Pretty fine servers
-Weapons are okay 
-Includes iconic WWII weapons
-Have the abillity to aim down the sights on a few amount of weapons
-Weapon balance (Most of the time) (ex. higher damage and low recoil for slower firing speed)
-Scopes look clear and not just a free clipart used on a scope

Cons:

-50 year old men spam their mic
-This game is dead
-30% of the Day of Defeat servers are English
-You either play on an Italian, or a German server
-GIVE US DAY OF DEFEAT 2 VALVE


Rating: 6.5/10
As I always say, Day of defeat: Source is like a family reunion in arkansas. You dont know anybody, But every one knows each other and is pretty friendly, so you stay for a few hours and everyone eats potato salad.
One of the best "play for fun" games. 
No ranking system, no unlocks. 
Just community servers and their plugins. 
These community servers make the game still breath; stay alive. 
Realism, Gun Game- they got it.
In this shooter, you actually die when guns shoot you.  There are also almost no children (at least on the mics.)

10/10 still going strong a decade later.  Make a fuckin sequel, someone.

This game has been fun for me, I don't understand all the trolls saying that they disliked it because there aren't man servers to play on or they get banned.

1) There are plenty of servers and even ones that have servers hosting in other countries. I have had no problem finding a server with people playing on them. (And just P.S. a chunk of them are old timers so before trying to play at 2-3 A.M. just understand that.)

2) A majority of the admins on servers that I have seen are quite fair and not young jerks that abuse their powers, if the person that wrote the negative review says they were banned, they probably deserved it.

This game has a great comradery in the server and as you play you will make friends with lots of people that are nice to talk to. The price is another great reason to give this game a try, I mean really, only 10 dollars? Conclusion being this game is definitley worth the price if you have some extra cash to spend. Take some time getting to know the servers, dont be a dick, and just have fun.
Better than Call of Duty: WWII.
Surprisingly large playerbase even 12 years after release. Feels very much like Half-Life 2 with a WW2 reskin over it, but that's not a bad thing.

(Edit to correct the number of years since release)
Fast paced, team oriented, objective based shooter. If your not working together with your teammates, then your not doing it right. The game still holds up even after all these years. The guns feel/sound great and the level design is fantastic. The community is suprisingly still very active, its always easy to find a 32 player server with good ping ( I play on the west coast).

I hope that Valve remembers what a great franchise they have and make DoD2 or DOD:GO. Please I'm finally ready to go back to WWII!
The player can choose one of 6 avaible classes to play. Each class offers a set of weapons, which can be exchanged on the battlefield. This enables an easy entry to the game but some weapons like the Rifleman are harder to play. I like this class because it offers a weapon type which has a high damage output like a sniper rifle but is still playable with a crosshair.

After all those hours and years I still come back every now and then to play it again. I can recommend it to player who like a WW2 shooter setting and are familar with Source Engine Games.
It's aged, but it's a great game. In the 13 years or so of it's existence, it's aged pretty well, with it's community still going stronger than the Tiger tank in the middle of Donner. From my experience, a lot of people on DoD:S, apart from around holiday times, are far older. Hell, I've heard a couple talk about grandkids. But honestly, they're a lot funner to be around and far more mature than, say, children in a TF2 trading server, for example. It's not the greatest game of all time, with some bs servers and some spikes of immaturity, but that's to be expected with older games such as this. I've got a GIANT soft spot for this game, and I'm glad to say I'm a part of the community. 10/10
Where do I even begin with this game? It's such a great game and I've made both great friends and memories playing this. I'll never forget the good old days of DOD. I just wish one day I can do it all again.
A classic! I grew up on original (retail) DoD, I used to rush home from school and spend hours playing Flash, Avalance, Donner, Anzio.... all the classics! DoD Source has aged very well, the graphics and gameplay are as smooth as ever. I just checked back in after a while and still a good handful of servers up.
This game is awesome (just look at my playing hours^^) and this is why:
+ Source engine
+ Fast gameplay
+ Original voices
+ Soundscapes (provide realistic ambient)
+ Mapping possible (Hammer editor)
+ Community content (literally every cosmetic customization you want to have)
+ Team Play needed
+ VAC secure works great
+ Balanced weapons/solider classes
+ Different game modes

Since there are positive aspects, there have to be negative ones, right?
- Many offical maps are not really balanced
- Often bad team play, because rampageing is possible
- Just three game modes (domination, demolition, two-way demolition)
- Spraying is accurate (Tommy and MP40)

But still 9/10 because this game is a gem under all FPS games! Since Call of Duty United Offensive one of the best games...
Day of Defeat Source is an HD remake of Day of Defeat, same controls as the original, just F for flashlight, like every Valve game past 2004. I usually play Valve games (passed 2004) with the motion blur on, and here it actually is the best. Every other Valve game I've played before this usually has a rare framerate jitter but in this, everything is just fine! I actually have so much fun with Day of Defeat: Source, the community of people I've played with on it are all very nice people.

Everyone I've played with is also a pro. So I'm basically a beginner to this game. But yeah I am alright at the game, I got about 21 kills in total so I'm alright at the game. My best weapons are the sniper rifle and the one where you need to go prone and RMB to start aiming. Again, the recoil with the machine guns is awful...actually, worse. I'd say the recoil in this game is so bad. I really really REALLY don't like it here. I am surprised they haven't taken off the recoil and did something better. Honestly.

The gameplay here is basically Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, and Half-Life: Source. Controls are the exact same again (Mentioned earlier). The gun design is better than it has been before. It's definitely an improvement from the original (just the recoil is the problem). More people play this game than the original Day of Defeat, and jumping doesn't take away stamina! So in the original Day of Defeat, jumping and running would take away stamina, usually. But in this game, running only takes away stamina, and this is an improvement. A much needed fix. I'm glad they have noticed this and fixed it. It was honestly really dumb in the original...but yeah that's Day of Defeat: Source. Anyway, final score time.

Final score: 85%

15% taken off due to the recoil. But anyway, the game is just fine. It's definitely better than the original, if I'm being honest. It has REALLY good graphics (from what you'd see in a Source game) and the fixes with old problems are fixed, like jumping takes stamina, which actually pissed me off a lot. Anyway, this review is over. I'm finished. Anyway, thanks for reading the review, hope you found it helpful in any way. Thanks for reading.
