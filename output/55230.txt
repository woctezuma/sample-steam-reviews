THE GOOD:
-The only game on the market that let's you bludgeon a couple of furries to death with a twelve-inch dildo

-Exceptionally funny
-Great voice acting (go Laura Bailey!)
-Likable cast of characters
-Over-the-top story
-Tons of chemistry between the actors
-Shooting and fighting is fun and over-the-top
-Cheats are available

THE BAD:
-No fast travel (WTF, Volition?)
-No day/night cycles
-No restaraunts
-Stupid AI
-Occassional repetitiveness

In this day and age of grizzled, badass mercenaries saving little girls from hordes of zombies in all our media, you can really appreciate it when a game doesn't take itself seriously and just decides to have fun. Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE recognizes all the cliches found in dark RPGs and goes insane with it, as Lollipop Chainsaw embraces the absurdity of a chainsaw-wielding cheerleader and her headless - and still alive, mind you - boyfriend.

In a similar case, Saints Row: The Third marks a crucial turning point in the franchises' history: it's still a GTA clone, yes, but it's the first game to truly throw away any chances of being serious and fully embraces the insanity of a chainsaw-wielding gimp mowing down a stripper. No longer will it be [i]just[/i] a GTA clone, but it's now known as a silly, unserious and blatantly fun GTA clone. And it works well enough to actually [i]surpass[/i] GTA in several aspects, most notably if you value blowing shit up rather than mundane things in a gritty crime world.

Saints Row: The Third is a stupid game, but it's smart enough to embrace it's stupidity, and it fully shows in the story and gameworld: having become multi-media superstars, the Third Street Saints juggle both celebrity fame and crime like a skilled entertainer, but as the story progresses, it's clear that they can have only one of these. This would be a very interesting central theme regarding identity versus progression, but it's also the same game that features you riding a bondage ponyboy chariot as you shoot other ponyboy/ponygirl chariots - and they explode.

Regardless, the characters, interactions and setpieces all prove to be incredibly entertaining and enjoyable. There's no shortage of chemistry on any of the character's part, and some voice actors previous binded to the anime/JRPG industry first make their new - and impressive - debut into the triple-AAA industry. (Namely, Troy Baker and Laura Bailey)

Even with the absurd situations, fun gameplay and lovable cast ensemble, Saints Row still makes some glaring mistakes. No fast travel, no day/night cycle, no restaraunts or stores, and the repetitive nature of numerous missions makes exploring the world a bit of a drag. Regardless, the game itself is so fun - and well-executed otherwise - that it doesn't overshadow the good of what this game brings.

With the complete edition being $15, Saints Row: The Third is a steal that's every bit as stupid as it is self-aware. It knows it's a shameless GTA clone, but it manages to be so embracing of it's flaws that it turns itself into strengths with how over-the-top and ridiculous the setpieces the game offers. With a goofy smile and a winning wink, Saints Row: The Third marked the beginning of a new era for the franchise, and it's silly charm remained for all future games.
Great game. There's some over-the-top action scenes, some absurd humor, but really nothing game breaking. Want a piece of advice ? The coop mode will make it even better !

If you want some fun, alone or with a friend, this game is for you!
You just have to know, this sequel is not as serious as the previous game, but again, Saints Row is not really about being serious. 
In my opinion, I think Saints Row The Third is better than Saints Row IV.
I first played this game on a "Play for free weekend,"... I think I played about the first five minutes, and then bought it- seriously it was that good. This was one of the only games that I actually tried to play slllooowwwwllly, because I wanted to "savor" the storyline. I would play 1 mission, then go on 5 or 6 sidequests just to make that main storyline last as long as I could. I love the voiceover acting, the writing, the graphics, the humor... where do I stop? Granted, the humor in this game is at times dark, and sexual... so just FYI, but if you're the person that enjoys a good "edgy" joke, you will love the witty banter between the characters in this game.

A lot of people have tried to ask about the likeness to GTA IV... and called this a GTAIV copycat... well maybe... if you could say that GTAIV got an actual good port to PC, and maybe if you could say that GTAIV was actually funny... and maybe if the missions actually made sense and just walking around didn't absolutely frustrate the living Hotel Echo Lima Lima out of me. Also, a big part was the driving for me. GTAIV took the same car, and just copied it with different skins over and over- this game actually makes each car a little different, the handling, the speed, the features- and everything is customizable! You can put NOS on cars, change the rims, the decals, the paint, the color of the windshields... there are literally endless posibilities of driving around your pimped out car- also, it is so much easier to drive. If this was a GTAIV copycat, then SR did a MAJOR overhaul in the coding and scripting system for the driving because it is a breeze and joy to drive around in this game! :)

Synopsis: Funny, Witty, Enjoyable, (Did I mention Co-op camaign?! Only 2 people though :Notice) you will laugh, cry and connect with the characters and be able to play it over and over again. Do yourself a favor and get it- you won't regret :).
Saints Row: The Third takes place three years after the previous game. You are the gangleader of the Third Street Saints. The Saints are no longer just a brutal and effective criminal operation but now a fully-fledged media empire with their time split equally between doing dirt and setting up legitimate businesses and a popular line of merchandising.
After a bank heist gone wrong, the Saints find themselves in Steelport, butting heads with a local crime group known as the Syndicate. From there it is the classic rise to power story.
The appearance and personality of the Saints' leader is completely up to you, thanks to the character editor. You can make him or her look genuinely cool, or a complete abomination. If you want to change your look, or even your sex, visit a plastic surgeon in the city and change it. If you want a new outfit, there are shops full of every type of fashion imaginable.
Missions place you in increasingly unpredictable situations. It starts out fairly low-key with a raid on a military base to steal weapons for the gang, but it finishes with an explosive finale involving tanks, jets and city-levelling explosions. In between, there is a zombie outbreak, a trip inside a Tron-like computer world and much more, it gets wilder and more varied.
There is also an element of choice to the decisions you make. Certain missions see you choosing between two options that will affect the story, sometimes in quite dramatic ways.
The game has a lot of replay value, after finishing the main story you are able to do a lot of side missions, e.g. car-stealing missions and assassinations.
The best way to play Saints Row: The Third is to play with a friend. The co-op action and the careful attention to detail in the co-op mechanics are masterful. It is easy to drop in and out of a friend’s game and the way progress is tracked is very smart. If you join a game where the other person is further along in the plot than you are, you can still play a plot mission with them.
The dialogue between the characters is consistently hilarious. The game is packed with in-jokes, meta humor and constantly swerves into almost surreal territory. 
The graphics may not be mind blowing, instead the game really shines with the sound. Everything sounds great from the gun battles to the snippets of incidental speech that you get when wandering around. The voice acting takes it up a notch though with some truly memorable performances. The best thing is the music selection though. A great selection of dance, hip hop, indie and metal are on offer from the in-game radio stations.
Overall I think the game is fantastic. It just gives you so much to do and a lot of fun if you play with a friend. Saints Row: The Third is worth to buy.

What you need to know about Saints Row The Third:

Pros:
+ An open world GTA-esque game with a lot of upgrade options, including player survivability and weaponries
+ Great sense of progression
+ In-game characters are loaded with personality and quickly get attached to them [spoiler](except Angel; Angel is boring af)[/spoiler]
+ Large range of arsenals, ranging from ridiculous impractical shit ([spoiler]giant purple dildo sword[/spoiler]) to ridiculous practical shit [spoiler]molluscs launcher FTW[/spoiler]
+ Quite amazingly detailed character customisation [spoiler]I came for the boob slider, end up staying for the story and gameplay[/spoiler]
+ SUPER COMICAL AND (un)ETHICAL
+ You can do shit together with your partner in crime (Multiplayer)
+ Is not as shallow as I expected

Cons:
- Fairly short gameplay (by 25 hours, I managed to get '100%' progress, although it's not a true 100% completion since I still have some side tasks on saints notebook left not done)
- Gets pretty grindy, especially if you are a completionist
- AI friend is dumb as a rock
- Glitchy in-game physics and collision (especially fence)
- Graphic is pretty meh
- DLC contents unlock fairly early and can be pretty cheesy 

A pretty solid game; with the massive sale on the base game + DLC bundle, I highly recommend you to pick it up

Edit: Spelling
[h1]Saints Row: The Third - A third person open-world coop shooter[/h1]

This Saints Row part was in my eyes the BEST Saints Row and one of the best open-world games. 

[b]PROS[/b]
-This game is much fun coop but also can be fun alone
-Almost every system runs this game (I was playing with constant 30 FPS on medium settings with a GT 620 and a low tier quad core i5)
-There exists a BIG sellection of weapons and outfits
-The Story is really epic and is easy to understand
-You can decide between chapters [spoiler]and endings[/spoiler]
-There are many rides with different features (mission cars)
-The map is big, so there is enough space to mess around with the police
-The Upgrading system is really ballanced at some parts
-The character customization is really good and was a gigantic improvement from the Saints Row 2 character customization
-There are many activitys you can play in your spare time

[b]CONS[/b]
-There is WAY too much DLC (some of them only add some outfits or melee weapons)
-This game has WAY too many glitchs (sometimes you can glitch your car in a house and can't get out) and some missions will also glitch when you play coop with another player

[b]For 100% players[/b]
-You need a second player for the three coop achievements and some achievements are anyways easier to do with a second player
-You only have to buy the Genkibowl VII, the Gangstas in Space and the trouble with clones DLC, because only these have achievements
-You can play on easy, because some achievements are really annoying with cops shooting at you

[b]Recommendation[/b]
You DEFINETLY should buy this game if you have the spare money (even when it isnt in sales), but ONLY buy the DLC when it's in sales, because some of them have low to almost no content.
I am a mature gamer, who tends to stick with mature/dark/serious/realistic games focused on plot and maybe even emotion, and I always like to play as the troubled, complex and dark characters.

That shit went straight out the window as soon as I brought this game, now my maturity has decreased by 6% upon experiencing the absurdly childish wonders that are mass murdering bad guys with giant dild*os and playing as a toilet.

Buy this game and become enlightened. Some say you have not lived until you've seen the seven wonders of the world, I say you have not lived until you've experienced the ridiculousness of Saints Row: The Third.

👍 Character Customization

[h1]REVIEW[/h1]
[b]Saints Row: The Third[/b] is a masterwork of a game, and a quintessential specimen of its genre. There is a perfect balance of pragmatism and ludicrousness inherent to each and every aspect of the game. The mosaic of realistic and ridiculous themes is expertly crafted into one of the most enjoyable games in existence, let alone in the sandbox genre. All but the most extremely discerning gamers should be able to enjoy it.

One of the first features of [b]Saints Row: The Third[/b] that will jump out at you is the fact it is full of preposterous themes, demonstrated not only in the narrative and atmospheric elements, but also the gameplay itself. And so, you definitely aren't supposed to approach this game seriously. That becomes painfully obvious once you learn that you can hop out of a speeding jet and crash face first into the middle of a city with no parachute... only to bounce up and run down the street naked, caving in people's skulls with giant purple sex toys.

Yet despite being a heavy-handed and purposeful parody of itself, the narrative of the game is actually entertaining and logically sensible (by that I mean it adheres to the logic of the gameworld, not real life). And the ludicrousness doesn’t ever get so totally out of hand that it starts to feel like a [i]”simulator”[/i] game; there is always some semblance of a purpose and direction. [b]Saints Row: The Third[/b] is a good example of how a game doesn’t have to be serious, but also can have an entertaining and somewhat logical narrative.

There is also a number of factors which add a significant layer of customization, progression, and statistics to the game— all of which contribute to increasing the overall [i]epicness[/i] of the experience. For one, there is a wide range of customizing ability, from your character to your vehicles. Many hours can be spent just changing the theme of your gang. There is also a system of XP and level progression, which is uncommon in the genre, but synthesizes perfectly in [b]Saints Row: The Third[/b]. You can use your level-ups to customize certain abilities of your character, and if you devote enough time, you can eventually make yourself invincible purely through the level system (not cheats/codes).

Furthermore, the gameworld in [b]Saints Row: The Third[/b] is a very enjoyable sandbox to play in, and there is a lot of potential for riotous fun to be had. The gameworld is large enough to be interesting, but not so large it becomes a burden to traverse. To keep you busy between campaign missions, there are dozens of side-missions of various gameplay styles which add pleasant diversity. Outside the primary and secondary missions, there are numerous minigames and challenges (stunting, base jumping, racing, streaking, etc.) which all contribute to creating an environment where you can spend hours of gameplay just messing around and having fun, without actively pursuing missions or progressing the game.

And another amazing feature of this game is the ability to play the actual campaign in co-op mode.  Instead of just messing around in the sandbox with friends, you can actually beat the game together.

There is also a lot of DLC, which ranges from cosmetic additions to full-blown extra campaigns. I would say it is definitely worth it to get the GOTY edition right from the start.

Bored of gta? want something funnier, more overwhelming adult jokes? 
say no more, this game will entertain you with the adult fantasies you never heard of!
crazy armory that makes every combat always felt different.
Character customization = Perfecto!
Probably the best game I ever played in my life. Saints Row: The Third might look like other open world games but it has much more fun, possibilities, jokes, customization, and it also gives you the feel of power and control more than every other game of its kind. The missions are always surprising, you'll never know what's next: Helicopter flying, exploding things with a tank, shotting, hiring h*****s, etc. Just buy it and play, totally worth it.
Saints Row: The Third. I thought it was a very good game. The thing that got me the most was the comical humor. The costumes and wardrobes, to the sexual references and balancing dead bodies with exaggerated weapon effects. I found this game to be a LOT beter compared to Saints Row and Saints Row II. If follows the time line, which is always a plus. The amount of things you can do, in my opinion, is much more and better than GTA. GTA is more on a serious note, which is good; Saints Row: The Third has some serious moments, but knows how to offer a laugh and good time with a balance.

The Story Line is pretty simple and basic, but not as generic as you would expect. You have a mixture of things, from saving your Homies, to fighting Gangs, Police, Military, Politicians, Zombies and Aliens. The gangs, especially one in particular are trying to take turf. What kind of gang isn't? The Genki line I found the most fun. It's basically like a game show arena. You fight your wat through enemies as well as the environments. It's definitely rewarding in the end, but not as much as it should be. In the end, you begin to gather forces for a take over. A bloody, deadly and annoying battle takes place.

The Combat System was very fun. Shooting duel pistols at enemies and watching them fly across the street. The Genki Mobile went shoots flames around all sides of the car as you drive, leaving a flaming inferno of destruction in your path. Falling from a disintergrating plane and shooting people as you fall with style. Fighting in wrestling rings with other gang members. Or you can do it with classic style by running them over with your cars and going on a shooting rampage. Some people may frown on it, but it is only a game after all. It could even relieve some frustrations.

Didn't have much of an Online Experience. It's pretty difficult to find others willing to play or willing to stay. So, unless you have a friend to play this with, I would recommend that more. At least if you want the achievements that go with this.

4/5 Singleplayer   2/5 Online/Coop

10 / 10
Alright, let's get this out of the way.
 
 I recommend this game for various reasons, some of them you might find utterly hilarious. But what can I say? This game is hilariously fun to play if you're bored. It's even more fun when you play with someone else. You can run them over with cars, drive cars off bridges and into the water- heck you can run cops over with cars and just have the road filled with tanks and police officers and military officers.
 This game is purely stupid, just like me, and you can murder people like Professor Genki.
 But, if you're more into the storyline, they got a 10/10 juicy storyline. And the storyline is juicier than the cooked turkey legs my family makes. 
 You wanna shoot people? Bam, they've got it! You wanna kick people's nuts? Bam, problem solved! And if you wanna do the classic 'punching people's faces', boy are you in for a treat!

 To sum this up- this game is brighter than my future. I recommend it. Seriously.
HERE'S A PURPLE DILDO BAT! GO NUTS!

Ok, so I'm going to be honest about this. The only reason I came back to Saints Row: The Third was because I really wanted to play Saints Row IV and I knew it is a direct sequel. I haven't played 1 or 2 so I wanted a bit of context. I was expecting to have a good time but given the thing I've heard about The Third I expected nothing special, just a servicable third person open world akin to GTA IV or something. Boy, was I wrong! It's GTA crancked up to 11 or on steroids if you prefer and I'll try to explain why in this review. As I said, I haven't played 1 or 2 so I'll mostly be comparing The Third to GTA and not the prior Saints Row games.

First, a bit about the technical side of things, graphics and sound. I liked the graphical style. It has a cartoony feel that fits the over the top nature of the game. The graphics have aged up fine and are pretty servicable given that the game is 7 years old. It felt fine. What I found strange, was that I had some extreme frame drops for no apparent reason. I mean the screen wasn't cluttered with stuff or anything and it's inexcusable for a 7 year old game that had all the time in the world to be properly patched but it never crashed or anything, so I guess, no real harm done. 

Soundwise I was also very satisfied. Great voice acting all across the board which gives an added dimension, again to the cartoony over the top nature of the game. Also, great music selection on the radio stations that you can listen to while driving and The Mix(an 80's pop rock station which was the one I listened to the most) gave me the VRock vibe from Vice City, something that I haven't felt in another open world GTA clone since. Songs in this station include "I Need A Hero", "You're The Best" and two Motley Crew songs(my favorite band when I was a teen), excellent company for drivebys or driving to objectives. Some of these songs are also used in key story missions and really elevate them to memorable moment status. Another welcome addition to the stations was the classical music station for when you need to clear the soundspace. One minor complaint I have with the music though is that the selection of the songs was kinda limited, as opposed to GTA stations for example, so you had a lot of repetion. If you're playing the game for 40 hours it's really noticable.

On to the gameplay, the meat and bones of the game and the story. As I mentioned earlier, it's GTA on steroids. This is apparent in every aspect of the game and every single mechanic. You have melee weapons like a purple dildo bat or two oversized fists that explode people. Special weapons like a bazooka that launches mind controlling squid or another weapon that conjures up sharks from the sewers to eat your poor targets. Even the SMGs can be uprgraded to laser weapons and also that fits into the story in a nice way. I guess the game takes place in a sorta futuristic alternate universe while not stepping away from the current world and it's a good fit. 

Now I'll talk about the things I really loved in the game. The progression system, the side activities and the customisation. The progression system is what really sets this game apart from other open world games. Sure, every game offers upgrades to your character but which game makes you a living God??? Let me explain. What I'm refering to is that you can upgrade your character to take less damage from all manner of things. Fire, weapons, cars etc. The final upgades for these is that you take no damage. Now, not all people will like that. I mean, essentialy it's like activating a God mode cheat BUT it is achieved by putting in the hours and playing the game, which brings me to the grind and side activities. This is by far the best thing about the game. The map is divided into parts of the city controlled by rival gangs that you need to take over and inside them are activities and collectibles that you need to complete and find to earn money and respect, the currencies for everything in the game from upgrading your character to buying weapons and everything in between. I would have liked for the costs of everything being higher because with a moderate amount of grind you can achieve the aforementioned God status fairly easily. Still, I loved these. I found the activities to be very enjoyable and varied and myself always wanting to grind more. Also, pretty much everything you do gets you money or respect so you're always earning something and progressing which is a nice feeling. There are also challenges which range from doing wheelies with bikes to kill certain amounts of rival gang members to using a certain amount of NPCs as human shields. There are also side mission(Assassinations and Vechicle Thefts) to complete. What I'm trying to get at is that the game has a lot of content that will keep you busy and entertained for many hours and you can really do everything at your own time and it works perfectly for the open world to be a densely packed playground for you to enjoy and I haven't even touched the customisation yet... 

Oh boy, the customisation! You can pretty much adjust everything to your liking. From clothes, to weapons, to cars, to heck even having sex reassingment and complete plastic surgery if you weren't pleased with the character you created in the start of the game. This ungodly amount of options is really one of a kind for Saints Row games in comparison to let's say GTA games or Watch Dogs 1 and 2. Let's conside car customisation for example. You can pimp any ride in the game! EVERY SINGLE ONE! (except the Flatbed which really felt like a missed chance given the empty space in the back). You can take a street sweeping vechicle and replace the sweepers with bladed wheels and there are all sorts of stuff like this which I've never encountered before. I made my own fun in a big way by collecting every single car and customising it to my liking, earning respect along the way to better my character. 

Now on to the biggest problem I had with the game, which is a minor one but something I didn't fully enjoy nonetheless. The story. The story begins with the Saints having reached worldwide fame status and being a powerful and ever recognisable brand. Then at the prologue, some things go wrong and they find themeselves in a new city where they have to fight the Syndicate an alliance of rival gangs and start again from scratch to achieve dominance. The story is really over the top and you can find the most crazy elements inside it but for me the actual story was very hit and miss and also the writting was just meh. While the story tries to up the stakes and the craziness all the time it fell flat for me. I didn't feel a struggle and everything was easily achievable in the context of the story. It had some cool and imaginative moments that were a welcome surprise but overall I found myself caring more about the grind and side activities than the story. The cutscenes were also directed in a really pedestrian way, they didn't feel cinematic and that didn't help things. Last but not least the writting was also hit and miss. It's mostly crude potty humour and basic sex jokes. I have no problem with those in general, in fact I love it but I feel that they relied too much on some running jokes that simply didn't work for me and I didn't find the "offensive" stuff to be really inventive, most of the times it felt like it was written by a high schooler.

To summarise, I love this game. While the story may have been a dissapointment most of the time, everything else made up for it and then some. I'm so pumped up for starting a new Saints adventure in Saints Row IV which I know to be even more over the top and out there in terms of gameplay. I think the Saints games are about having that open world mayhem playground sandbox. Like when you would go on a killing spree in GTA but here it is the focal point of the game and it is just a niche that this franchise fills very well indeed.
I knew nothing about the saints row franchise when I started playing this game. I expected to play a normal, gta-like video game with a character creation. Boy was I wrong. This game made me fall in love with the franchise, both new and old style, and you should do the same. I gave this game the custom nomination vote: "I didn't expect this to happen".
Saints Row: The Third is an over the top, open world over the shoulder third person shooter with strong action, good controls and some over sexualized comedy. There are plenty of giant purple bats, leather clad dancers, and awkward situations all done for the sake of comedy. You play as the head of a gang from the start, but really its a group of three tight friends that grows bigger to include a giant powerhouse, an ex FBI tech geek, a pretensions actor, a serious turncoat twin and an auto tuned pimp. These aren't just quest givers, you can call on them to help you on missions. When they're with you, they're smart enough to find cover in gun fights, take hostages and even steal a car to follow you when you drive off without them. When your "homies" fall, you need to pick them back up or lose the mission. There are frequent checkpoints, but with a game so fun, I don't mind if I die.

The franchise really took a step away from being just a lesser version of Grand Theft Auto. They upped the gameplay and the comedy. Where GTA 4 turned gritty and real, Saints Row went the silly fun route. You can take hostages to use them as human shields. Improve your aim by crouching down. Head shot any enemy for an instant kill. Otherwise the enemies will spin around hoping to find cover and forcing your aim to follow them. There are multiple flying take downs and the animation seems outstanding for something that has so many of them.

There is so much customization too. Everything from customizing your own look, to creating how your gang looks. If you want all thugs, go for it. If you want all space men or strippers. That's up to you. Their stats aren't affected. Its all just a look. Having your crew around makes an interesting mission even more fun. The whole thing is streamlined. Go to your PDA that will get a phone call sending you to a location on your GPS to start the mission. You'll find a wide variety in missions, fly to this location, take out a bunch of gang members, hop in a turret, drive through hostile territory, jump out of a plane ..... in a tank and shoot at people and other tanks as you fall. Then hop in a virtual world with a new weapon. Its always interesting and a few missions take place outside of the city in their own unique environments.

Some missions end with a choice that really adds replay value. Do you get a one time sum of cash, or do you want a constantly generating smaller sum of cash. Do you want the aide of someone new or keep someone old? Even down to trivial things like discounts on car upgrades vs discounts on weapon upgrades or who you let live.

The city of Steelport is a bright, beautiful, vibrant and gritty city. It all depends what area you're in. The industrial zone  has no lights, while the tourist part has beautiful neon lights. The city really lights up at night and looks amazing while flying. As the game progresses, the sights change. You'll see a sunken aircraft carrier, a plane tail up and much more to remind you of just how you've affected the city.

Since this is a new city, you'll need to take it over. How do you do that? Participating in side quests like racing cars or a turf war with one of the three rival gangs in the city. You can buy stores that count to the take over percentage. There are even score based games like insurance fraud and mayhem that have you rag dolling into cars or destroying property. When you own a percentage of the city, you'll make money for it every real life hour you play. Outside of controlling the city, you can participate in assassinations, car thefts and hijackings with a passenger, then hold them until you get a ransom. 

Money for weapons becomes irrelevant. You'll always have more than enough ammo even if you never visit a gun store. What the money really goes to are upgrades. In the PDA menu you'll upgrade how much ammo you can have, what guns your crew has, your total health, how fast it regenerates, how much stamina you have and so much more. This is the expensive part of the game. Each gun has four levels of upgrade. The fourth level is always something silly like explosive bullets from a pistol.

There are plenty of weapons in six major types, melee, small, sub machine guns, shot guns, assault rifles, misc (rockets), sniper rifles and four types of throwable things like grenades. You can only have one of each weapon type equipped at a time, but that's more than enough. Some missions require you to use a rocket launcher and it won't just give you a launcher, it gives you unlimited rockets. Its one of the joys of this game. High powered weapons with big effects. Once the STAG army shows up, there are some even more creative weapons like a force rifle that when used it pushes away enemies and fully charged obliterates them. There's just so much variety here, even a tactical missile strike, but that's not nearly as fun as everything else.

Bosses are big brutes that can run right through you. They are pretty simple to take down though. Shoot them enough times and a quick button prompt will finish them off. The ones without guns will throw cars and benches around. The ones with guns carry flame throwers or heavy machine guns that thankfully jam. With them gone you can pick up their heavy weapons to use as your own, but the bigger the weapon, the slower you move. These weapons are worth the time for the power and fun they bring, especially the sticky bomb launcher.

On top of that, you can climb into vehicles, cars, motor cycles, trucks, but better than that are tanks, armored SUVs, helicopters and some futuristic hover jets and cycles. The hover jets and cycles have two modes, jet and hover. Its perfect from a gameplay standpoint, go fast or hover so you can easily take out slow moving ground units and land on a dime. The vehicles with weapons are a lot of fun to shoot with unlimited ammo, but there are cool downs. Tanks that pancake cars. Missiles that lock onto things and follow them. Its very enjoyable.

The characters in your crew are excellently voiced and your chemistry together really shines through. Sure they poke fun at one another, but they have some memorably fun times beyond just shooting things. Silly happy moments like singing to Sublime on the radio and Oleg revealing how he has met his intellectual equal while in a firefight. The bosses of the gangs are worthy characters in their own right. They really make cut scenes interesting.

With you playing a criminal and all, there is notoriety in stars. The cops won't just chase after you, but the gangs and STAG army will too. Police will send helicopters with snipers. Enemy gangs will even setup roadblocks to stop you. It gets to a chaotic level sometimes when a gang and an army are after you. All three factions including your own start to fight in giant wars that can have dozens of people. Its amazing to be a part of. The game makes good use of big environments so you can flank your enemies and they can flank you.

Saints Row: The Third is an amazing and fun game with enough DLC to choke Godzilla. Its mostly all just cosmetic stuff. The Complete Pack has been $5, there's no reason not to pick it up, but with its comedy, its just not for kids.

[h1]Basic Information[/h1]
[b]Title:[/b]  Saints Row The Third
[b]Developer:[/b]  Volition
[b]Publisher:[/b]  Deep Silver
[b]Genre:[/b]  3rd Person Action

[h1]General Impression[/h1]
SR3 is a departure from the relative seriousness of the previous two titles in the series. No doubt about that and it's a good thing too. Saints Row The Third can no longer be called by anyone, a "GTA clone". It has its own distinct style. A true sandbox open world, where you can have fun/cause chaos at your own pace without being dragged down by some "gritty scenario based on real life gang warfare". Nope, you can finish the entire game nude, speaking Zombie and wielding a huge ♥♥♥♥♥-shaped baseball bat if that's what you want. That freedom of absurd choices is what makes this game far better than GTA IV for example. The cars control way better than SR2 and the customization is as good as it gets in video games. Don't skip to Saints Row IV directly, even if they share the map partially. They have enough differences to make them both, worth a try.

[h1]Strong Points[/h1]
+ Beautiful graphics and soundtrack.
+ Absurdly fun gameplay.
+ Steam Trading Cards & Achievements.

[h1]Weak Points[/h1]
- A few glitches.

[b]Rating 10/10[/b]

Saints Row: The Third continues the story of Saints Row 2, but you don't have to play it to understand the story.

Many years after Saints Row 2 the Saints are famous and gangs start envying them, thus they got new enemies.

+ Character design
+ Big city
+ A lot of clothing
+ Character customisation
+ Homies
+ Homes
+ Gangs
+ Humour
+ Upgradable cars and weapons
+ Territories
+ Choices
+ Activities

+/- Character interaction could have been better.

- Characters of SR 2 got a bit of a too big overhaul.
- The violence oversimplifies the storyline sometimes.
- No romances
Saint's Row The Third is an open world sandbox action game developed by Volition and published by Deep Silver. Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have evolved from an urban street gang to a household brand name with Saints sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobble head dolls all available at a store near you. The Saints are the true kings of Stilwater but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed. The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute or death. Refusing to bend the knee to the Syndicate, the Saints make a daring completely over the top escape and quickly find themselves in a very precarious situation. Dropped right into the heart of the Syndicate controlled city of Steelport with all of their assets taken...it's up to the Saints to reclaim their empire and show the Syndicate why the Third Row Saints are not to be trifled with. Having finished Saints Row 2 and immediately diving right into Saints Row The Third, I have to say that this game is an absolutely fantastic continuation of the series. To summarize, the plot is intriguing, the action superb and the soundtrack is excellent...this title is what a worthy sequel should strive to be. 

Fans of the series will find many things familiar while also having alot of new elements to deal with as well which is always refreshing to have in a truly successful franchise. The narrative is very compelling and really grips you from the beginning of the title and forces you to want to see how it plays out as you progress through the game. Happily I am very proud to report that the gameplay, some factors of which I had a problem with in the previous title, has been greatly refined by Volition as the driving, fighting and shooting are all quite intuitive and silky smooth this time around. And as the leader of the Third Row Saints, you will quickly find yourself thrust into some of the most over-the-top action movie like sequences from the very first minute that the game starts which brilliantly sets the pace for the rest of the interesting story. Lastly, let me not forget to mention the wonderful character customization included in this title. Guns, clothing and abilities...there are just so many things you can use to really flesh out your character. With all the options available you will definitely be able to create the Saint that you want to be.

Visually, I find this game to be one of the most beautiful open world titles available. Saint's Row The Third utilizes an excellent blend of depth of field effects, terrific animations, detailed set pieces, gorgeous colors and wonderful lighting that really is quite pleasing to the eye. The city of Steelport is a large heavily populated metropolis and a very interesting place to explore. I constantly found myself spending quite a bit of time just wandering around this wonderfully crafted sand-box environment just to admire the view. The city itself is chock full of unique landmarks and strange residents to interact with as you progress through the great story. Also, the title seems to have taken a completely different artstyle, which seems anime-inspired or cartoonish, over the more realistic look of the previous Saints Row games and it's absolutely terrific and plays very well alongside the completely outrageous action. To summarize, graphically this game will not dissapoint as it manages to deliver quite the presentation to the eyes.

I really enjoyed this game from start to finish as it kept me highly entertained for some time. It does a fantastic job of immersing you and making you feel as though you really are the leader of this organization. I've not tried the co-op but Saint's Row The Thirds single player campaign definitely has much replayability. Also, there are plenty of Steam Acheivements to accquire and Steam Trading Cards to collect. Saint's Row The Third will take you on one heck of a wild ride and is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to open world action gamers.
I stopped playing GTA in a "serious" manner after San Andreas.
Couldn't really get into IV and V (except of trying out some mods in V). Wasn't even interested in GTA Online.

Yet even if this is somehow branded as "GTA clone", I finally found something which turns out to be that funny as San Andreas and even more.
But also much weirder in a good way. I like the irony and slapstick this game provides.
Even the side quests are funny but sometimes also pretty challenging.
Which is something good in my understanding either. :)

This was just a pretty chilled journey:
http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1341580883

I didn't force the radio music to play those songs, but it seems the game itself provided me a nice situational comedy in this record. ^^
Get yourself dressed, crazy, armed and ready for mayhem and total overdose.
This is what happens when GTA meets pure comedy.

Don't make the mistake to compare this with Saint row II and misunderstand the concept.
SR3 is nothing like SR2 gang-war wise. Forget the dramatic gang war concept. Forget the GTA-Mafia mashed script writing. 
Saints Row 3 is action blended comedy with a dose of crazy and exaggerations, puns for movies and other games, sarcasm, and lots and lots of glamour.

Voice acting is awesome. Graphics, effects and physics are satisfying. Story length is ok. And map size enough to host a bunch of events, side missions, collectives and achievement related goodies.

Beat people to the death with a giant purple dildo and blow shit up.
Also supports a well stable co-op mode.

Totally recommended.
This game is like if Grand Theft Auto stopped giving a shit about it's engines and its physics, made all the cheats unlockable, put together its story from cliffnotes of cheesy action movies, and did nothing to get in the way of your God dammed fun.

In short, it's amazing. Buy it.

In all seriousness, comparing the Saints Row games to Grand Theft Auto isn't even fair anymore given their vast differences. Grand Theft Auto continues to set benchmarks, and Saints Row continues to go to the edge of the universe called Insanity. And that's perfectly okay, because both are enjoyable. So if you liked Grand Theft Auto but want a much more wild ride, this is the game to jump into. A perfect middle ground for the series, it's worth it at just about any price I'd say.
It doesn't matter how many years passed, it doesn't matter which Saints it is, people will continue playing it. One of the best sandbox open-world games ever created. You must buy this game.
[h1]Affable & liberating // Recommended for over-the-top thrillseekers[/h1]

+ Hilarious dialogue & general sense of humor
+ Clear objective markers and GPS directions; you're almost guaranteed to never get lost
+ Fantastic soundtrack; covering all major genres from screamo metal to hip-hop, the game boasts quality entries for each
+ Decently large, open-world gameplay
+ Story is absolutley, incredibly ridiculous in the best possible way
+ Doesn't take itself seriously as a game; focuses on fun and replayability
+ Missions deviate satisfyingly in gameplay; there is a wide variety of activities, from hijacking vehicles while in a helicopter, to jumping in front of moving vehicles to rack up insurance money
+ Massive variety in character, weapon, and gang customization
+ Visuals are adequate and stand up fairly well to today's standards
+ All dialogue is competently voice-acted
+ Side mission activities are a blast to participate in, and enjoy a healthy variance
+ Fun and easy to mod

- Fire zombies bug; in one mission where the player must fight a zombie infestation, often zombies will swarm the player and (none of the zombies being on fire) will set you on fire, resulting in a continuous replay of the 'I'm on fire!' animation (extremely aggravating)
- AI for allies tends to behave poorly; your 'homies' will often walk out into heavy fire, forcing you to run out and help them (which is timed)

Imagine gta... now take that idea, add extasy, Michael bay, more drugs and explosions topped with Michael bay. That's what you get... every saints row mission feels like a final mission! They get as epic as they can get! 5/5 super fun with friends
A fun sandbox game while it lasts. The gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable though the extreme farcical tone the whole game envelopes itself in very easily can get on your nerves and wear its welcome thin.

Still it has a bunch of fun gameplay moments and if you like GTA style gameplay it delivers an enjoyable experience as long as you don't mind a nonsensical idiotic plot progression and leveling that when maxed up leaves you invincible and destroys what little difficulty the game had to begin with.

I'm sure its more fun co-op I haven't tried it but I didn't bother to finish the game once I reached the level cap and I'm not sure if I'll ever bother. It was a lot of fun before I grew bored though.
It's such a fun game I do not even know where to begin to describe it. I'm going to compare it with the GTA because it's what everybody has for reference and because I'm a big fan of GTA. It has like the GTA, an open map and all the action you want. history, missions, everything is designed to parody the usual genres, with much humor, sex, violence and black humor. But much. If you thought the GTA was for adults you can classify XXX.

At first I had a hard time picking up the thread because it seems to be linked to the other two Saints Row's. Then I found it a little chaotic because I did not know what I really had to do. The lack of realism (totally justified) in the physical and in the game mode can be disconcerting if you expect a serious game.

But once you enter the dynamic this game is milk. If the GTA is an American crime movie this is a Chinese action movie of the most delirious. It is not enough to do things here, you have to do them in style. The most unbridled and spectacularly possible.

Watching the videos seems like everything is a nonsense mess but in reality the story is well linked. The secondary and main missions are very well designed, original and complement each other wonderfully making the whole game a lot of fun.

The variety of weapons, vehicles and situations do not leave you time to get bored in any way. The personalization of the character is extreme so that you can enjoy it all train.

Let me tell you that if you have not bought the game yet, buy it now.
Saints Row: The Third is one of my best experience. It doesn't want you to take it seriously, but have the most time laughing, having fun, and enjoying yourself. The character customization feature stand out. The City is a big place based on New York, and you will have hours to go exploring.
Crazy and non-sense open-world game, really funny in what it does. At first I thought it was just a GTA clone, but it has its reasons to exist.
It has tons of stuff to do, with surprisingly enough variety, and basically rewards you for everything; a little bit on the easy side, but this doesn't make messing around less fun.
From a technical standpoint, it has its problems, and surely is not well-optimized, but nothing so bad to totally avoid it.
Co-op is surely the best thing this open-world has to offer, being it pratically the same game with another player, also, it's really easy to jump in.

Reccomended if you want to have fun in a mad open-world game, preferably with a friend.
[h1] The first thing that a video game should give you is a good time while you play it. And boy did i have a good time playing this.[/h1]
PROS:
[h1]1[/h1] Have you ever wanted to play the story mode of GTA5/4 with a friend. Well don't you worry because this game has Co-op. Now you have the chance to do all the crazy shit you can, but with your friend. The action is fast paced, fun, and fking insane. You can kill people with your rifles, smgs, shotguns obliterate them with your tank/attack chopper/vtol, call in an airstrike and send them to hell,  punch them in the balls, suffocate them to death with your farts in a jar or if you are kinky use your BIG PURPLE DILDO to beat them to death.
[h1]2[/h1] This is one of those games where you can spend a lot of time in character customization. You can be super buffed or super fat and ugly or even a hot chick with a big booty and titties. There are also so many clothes and outfits from which you can pick. Dress up like a knight, a ninja, a guy in a hot dog costume or just run around completely naked if you want, if that's your thing.
[h1]3[/h1] Shit-ton of weapons to choose from. Every single weapon can be leveled up to level 4 and with each level  gains a new bonus(incendiary/armor-piercing bullets, increased dmg and more).
[h1]4[/h1] You get cribs/penthouses all over the city where you have access to your garage/helipad (these penthouses are upradable and when you upgrade them you ger money,respect and weapon bonuses). You can also buy properties which give you % control over a district and increase your hourly income.
[h1]5[/h1] Unlike in GTA 5/Online where the cops are a pain in the ass to lose, here in SR 3 you can go inside your penthouses/properties and lose them. There is alos the posibility of calling the mayor for a favor and lose the notoriety.
[h1]6[/h1] You can use your phone to call any an attack chopper or any vehicle from your garage. You can also call anyone from your homies and trust me there are some strange homies (SWAT Team, Zombies, Space Brutina, Aisha Brutella, etc).
[h1]7[/h1] The story of SR 3 is pretty straight forward with a lot of humor and funny cutscenes (i won't be spoiling) and when you finish with the main story you still have a lot of side activities to do (if you haven't done them during your main story playtrough).
[h1]8[/h1] If you are on a budget and looking for a fun game that is worth your time, then you should buy SR3. It costs only 14,99€ with all DLCs and when there are  Steam Sales you can get it for 3,74€ .

CONS:
[h1]1[/h1] The one and only thing that i personally had a problem with was the following. When you play the game on the hardest difficulty the friendly AI is so fking stupid, that sometimes i wanted to punch my monitor. There are missions/activities where the AI has a crucial role, but it is so stupid and it just runs in one place or it runs non-stop into cars and walls in one place/keeps dying over and over (Pierce you moron im talking about you, you die every time). Note this is not all the times, but it does happen and it happens most of the time with Pierce !
Excellent game overall, the main story line took me around 15 hours to complete. Fair enough it's quite short but I'd much prefer it to be this short and amazing story rather than a long story and not as good story. One last thing I was slightly disappointed about was the fact I was hoping for 4 player co-op and it only has two player.
So...Saints Row:The Third.

Saints Row: The Third is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Volition and published by THQ. It is the third title in the Saints Row series,the one that mostly started the insanity of SR.

So,after the events from SR 2,3rd Street Saints become international stars,earning money,power,and fame,while still keeping fun from killing,robberies,and kidnappings!
Yet,when one of their jobs goes wrong,they have to return to traditional methods of fighting against other crime organization called "The Syndicate".

So,main problem many fans of SR 2 had,is that...this is not like SR 2. When SR 2 tried to be a GTA ripoff,SR 3 went into different direction,with more..."jokey" approach than before. How did it end?

Well,for me game is much better than SR 2 under..nearly every aspect,really!

Gameplay is nearly the same. Do missions to get revenge and progress in a storyline that is really well made,yet with too many cliches as for my taste,or conquer a city! 
How you can do that?
Well,first you can do activites,from protecting your homies,to being a part of a show!
If that will be done,you can always do challenges that involes every aspect of a game,from killing x enemies,to finding shortcuts in game!
AND you can also try to kill targets that have different way to lure them out,or you can try to get some vehicles for money and respect!
Customization system is really good,but i feel that somehow a little worse than in SR2. Still,you can really cusotmize your character,even better than in some RPG's! From body build,to clothes! And you can also choose 3 different voice actors per gender,that is 6! You can even choose what taunts you want!
You can also customize your crew and cars!

We also have upgrades! 
From typical character upgrades,such as more health,more ammo,damage resistance and stuff,to upgrading our homies. For better upgrades you have to have more money(duh.) and better respect level! It is really well balanced,but i fell that in the end,being nearly inderstructible with unlimited ammo to every gun,is a liiitle too much,as you become a God of Death.
A little too OP for me,yet this is SR so who cares.

Sound. Well,radio stations are always really good at SR. From Pop to Heavy Metal,everyone will find something for himself.
Expect reggae,because that radio station is no longer in game for some reason.
Voiceacting is really well made,really good job at that. Lip synch tho is...meh.
Main problem i have is with vehicles,as every car sounds litterally the same,and you can have terrible problem with sound while drifting or using nitro.

Graphic. Well,SR was never the best looking game and here you can see why,yet that is not really a big part of the game as often you will stay in motion. 
But if you will look closer,you will be dissapointed.
Pretty dissapointed.
Then again,if you care about graphic in that game,you are looking for wrong game my friend.

And there is a COOP,you can do everything in solo,but with your friend!

There is also a horde mode,but who cares about that one.

To expand your gameplay,you have A LOT of DLC's that have new clothes,missions,cars and weapons!

I had no problems with game,it worked perfectly.Sometimes you can only have some COOP problems with "Cheats" that you or your friend are using,but after that everything is fine.

At the end of the day,SR 3 is better title that 2,and going into the "fun" way turned out pretty well.
But it lacks..something. You can feel that devs can really make even more fun from that.

9/10.

Good Story (CHECK)

Badass Character (BIG MOTHERFUCKIN' CHECK)

not gonna lie , this game is awesome , u should buy it
Better than GTA! So much fun. Single player, or play with friends! Customize Cars, Clothes, Outfits, lots of guns and weaons, grab and throw people. Drive tanks, Lambos, and base jump off buildings! Even fly airplanes and brooms! Saints Row The Third makes fun of games like GTA and adds humor this this genre. Good times.
I just finished this game and I must say , this game stands out as one of the funniest , whackiest free roaming game ever .
You start out as the Boss of the Saints and your objective is to take over Steelport. You can customize your character in any way you want to buy customizing their clothes , tatto's body .etc . You also get many weapons to choose from . There are around 47 missions which I think is less for a free roaming game. Over all it's a must buy for saints row fans or free roam lovers .
The Best (Gameplay wise) Saint's Row, always a good game to go back to for some co-op craziness, pick it up while on sale if you ain't played it yet, worth a visit if you like Open-World foolishness (And has a pretty good soundtrack too)
Absurdly stupid and ridiculous. 

When it comes to this franchise though, that's actually high praise. The game takes what would be a generic open world third-person shooter and makes it great by refusing to take itself seriously in any way, shape, or form. The absurdity of the missions, the often hilarious dialouge (even when replaying) and gear that is genuinely fun to use make the game much more entertaining. 

STORY/PLOT

Now the story itself is pretty lackluster. You're once again the leader of the Saints, and now you're taking over a new town, blah blah blah. While the cutscenes and witty banter are funny, the story is there just to move the game along, nothing more, nothing less.

VISUALS

The graphics look fine, and while there are some weird things that happen now and then, overall the graphics look good. The visual effects (fire, bullets, etc.) are well done and add flair to the game.

AUDIO

The music is an oddball selection of things from various genres. This actually helps the game out. I'll never forget the first time I crashed my plane into a tank, bailed, and and proceeded to fight off the army to classical music. Sound effects are well done, and they help make each weapon or vehicle sounde distinct. They each sound like what you'd EXPECT them too. Voice acting is also well done.

GAMEPLAY

There's a ton you could say here so I'll keep in brief. The gameplay is entertaining, and the mechanics, such as driving, shooting, flying, and the physics are all just right. Once you complete the game, cheats offer another layer of fun, including the usuals, such as infinte health, ammo, free money, etc. But you can also get items you skipped during the story or spawn weapons that only NPCs could carry. There is also a 2-Player co-op mode. Playing this game online can be a lot of fun.

PERFORMANCE

This is where we start to have problems. This game has issues. Even on decent hardware, the game lags significantly, even with graphics turned to low and post-processing effects off. The problems become even worse on (in my experience) Radeon graphics cards. When I play multiplayer with my friend (both of us have good connections) we have teleportation effects and sometimes problems with seeing what the other player is doing, despite standing right next to them.

All of this becomes even stranger when you consider that Saints Row 4 runs much better on the same hardware. I'm able to have more scene detail and run it at it higher resolution, despite there being no differences in the hardware. I'm chalking this down to bad optimization. 

Your mileage will vary of course, based on your specs, but it's something to keep in mind.

VERDICT

If you're looking for a good freeroaming action game, or just looking to have a good time either solo or with a friend, this game is a good choice. Just know that if your computer trends toward the minimum requirements, you might have enough performance issues to make the game unplayable.

Overall, considering the performance issues, I'd give the game a solid 7/10.

PS: It comes on sale often, pick it (and maybe the sequel) up then.
Okay, after playing this for 6.7 hours.. I had to write a review about this game.

Saints Row 3 (The Third) is essentialy one of the best games I've ever played in my entire life.

The cons and pros will be listed below.

Pros:

- Has a well-balanced story that isn't too childish and goofy or too serious

- Has a amazing customization system which let's you have almost any look you've probably dreamed about in your life for a character or for a vehicle. (Seriously, if APB Reloaded's customization system had a son.. it'd be this game's one.)

- You can punch people with a large purple d*ldo on a stick.

- The character can have 4+ diferent voices (and some can be a female voice, even if your character is a male.)

- There are over 25 taunts to choose from (all of them are adapted to your character's voice)

- The co-op is smooth and ISN'T BROKEN (Yes. I'm looking at you, GTA 4.)

- You can complete the story-mode missions with your friend in co-op.

- You can run over people's cars with a colour-customized tank (and the cars are only crashed on the spot you ran them over. It looks realistic.)

- You can revive your teammates or your friend countless times within 25-30 seconds after their health has run out.

- The missions are EPIC.

- There is a wide modding community.

Cons:

-I couldn't find any neko ears on the clothes stores, but I'm sure I can install a mod and get some.


My final veredict is a 9.9/10, buy this, NAOW. YOU NEED IT. (With all of the DLCs if possible, they are totally worth it.)

P.S: Don't shoot Professor Genki, he'll beat the shit out of you.
Look this is Saints Row we're talking about here, if you don't know by now that its a fantastic game well... guess that explains why you're reading the reviews. So, as a quick TLDR Buy it, if you have more than enough money buy it and buy one for a friend, if you have enough money buy it, if you don't have enough money wait for it to go on sale, it always does.

Now for why you need to buy it right now.
Pre-Note: Saints row 4 is out so I don't get why you aren't looking at that but hey, whatever this game is just as good but less... super-hero-ey

Reason #1 : The game is Open world

Reason #2 : The game is like GTA where you can shoot some people have some fun, do whatever you want.

Reason #3 : The game has a very good Character Creation system so you can play as you want. Want to be a prom queen in high heels killing swat? sure. Wanna be a morbidly obese man in a thong and high heels? sure. Want to be high heels? Not possible, but you can be a toilet and some other... models...

Reason #4 : The game not taken seriously. if you want to play it serious the story is kind of.... off of real life standards but honestly its comedy gold. why would you play a realistic [b]game[/b]?

Reason #5 : Its drop in, drop out Multiplayer. (with friendly fire allowed to be enabled/disabled) Pissed off at a friend? Blast them in the head with a shotgun, and then they'll probably get mad and challenge you to a mini game called cat and mouse where you both go into a world where one person gets a helicopter with rockets and the other one has to dodge them all, then they get their turn after about 2 minutes (unless Player 1 kills Player 2).

Reason #5.5 : That last one got a bit off, but not only are there fun games to play with each other its co-op too, which means someone else can roam the world (no distance restrictions) and help you with your story, or side missions, or fucking off.

Reason #6 : The game runs... Well. Honestly I'm going to have to give this part a maybe, you should meet the "recommended" standards or else you will lag, which takes away from the fun a bit. Saints Row 4 runs better than SR3, don't ask me why but I assume that its better optimized.

Reason #7 : uhhhh... because I said hat its really great?

Reason #8 : OH YEAH! the soundtrack is great (car radio stations iPad thing etc.). Plus on the topic of cars you can customize your own, and not really have to worry about damaging it, buying a new one just charges you 500$ (in game money) which to be honest, in a world where you can seal any car that's just a small price.

Reason #9 : Look I'm just trying to come up with reasons now so feel free to stop reading at any time. Reason 9 is that you don't have to just play with your friends you can join another person in up to 4 player online Co-Op/Vs/Whatever.

Reason #10 : It's a big world?

Reason #11 : Because I said so. Again. Just buy it.

Story: 8/10 (barely paid attention to main story, however when I did it was... entertaining)
Gameplay: 10/10 (3rd person shooting etc.)
Presentation: 10/10 
Soundtrack: 11/10 (CRANK IT TO 11! Also this music is always fantastic. It'll even take you back to places you never knew existed.)
Replayability: 8/10 (Plenty of side stories and missions, and plenty to do with friends. Lasts for a long time.)
I dig this game like a crazy new drug. Yeah it has more than a few bugs that some times piss me off but the graphics & humor along with epic violence keep me so entertained I just have no choice but to over look it's flaws.
There is no trailer that can describe it sufficiently.
I can't describe it easily without spoiling it, so I will be extra careful and breif.

Let's just say that I never EVER had so much fun in a single player game. For real.

SAINTS ROW THE THIRD is a fantastic game. Ridiculously fantastic.

Graphics: 90/100
The game has fantastic graphics, you can see a lot of work on just anything.

Sound: 100/100
The game contains fantastic quality of sound fx, voice acts, and almost any kind of music you mihgt like to listen to.
Huge plus a mixtape feature that lets you choose what to listen. One of the games I actually listen to its own music.
But 100/100 goes for using music perfectly on main scenario missions.

Gameplay 99/100:
Can't ask for more. I mean there are lots of missions, lots of activities, lots of vehicles, lots of guns, lots of blunt weapons... the game NEVER lets you get bored. Aircrafts could have a reverse Y axis controls by default, but despite that perfect!

Scenario 100/100:
It is hillarious! It is fantastic. I can't believe that it actually made me feel a lot of feelings, while I was aware how cheesy it was (intentionally) in many parts!

Overall: 100/100
Yeah! I don't care, I did the math, I still give it a freaking 100/100. I had SO much fun playing it I cant't give less. What are you waiting for?
Go and get it!!!
This is the best and my most favorite part of Saints Row.Everything here is perfect, story, graphics, gameplay, music. Open world, different kinds of humor and crazy. I love this game!
Saints Row The Third It's awesome game , they have amazing mission , amazing graphics and characters too , great radio sounds , Good action , and its fun and looks like Grand theft auto style :) 
Reccomend :)
Saints Row The Third, as you can tell from the title, is the 3rd game of the franchise. I would say SR3 is the weakest game of the series, but the whole series is very good and very strong. In terms of the whole series, SR2 is my fav, hands down. I will end up comparing SR2 and 3 a lot in this review.

After the events of SR2, the Saints become total sellouts and go from being a badass gang, into celebrities. Right away this makes it not as interesting than the second game. As a great man once said, "Where Saints Row 2 is silly but is still grounded, Saints Row 3 drinks whackers aid from a clown's shoe." The game doesn't really give a reason on why things are happening. It just does things "Because it looks cool and has lots of action, AND EXPLOSIONS!!" The progression in this game is sloppy. The fact you can max out your character and achieve near god mode before you even finish Act 1! On top of that, this game throws you attack choppers and tanks pretty much right at the beginning of the game, taking away what little challenge this game offers.

The new gang members you get to join in your crew are all well written out and are all entertaining and fun to have around. Not only can you have a luchador named Angel who Hulk Hogen voices, but you can have Burt Mother F***ing Reynolds join you!

The character customization is, sadly, a step back from what SR2 had. SR2 had the ability where you could make a shemale, or the ugliest thing to ever grace the planet. Now you only have 2 gender options with nothing in between, where all males looked ripped to super f**king huge ripped, and females are always smexy looking. There is color options to make your character to look red or neon green. The clothing options have also took a step back. SR2 clothing options allowed for multiple layers like undershirt, shirt, dress coat, jacket, scarf, etc. The clothing options in SR3 is now upper body, lower body, head, shoes, etc. You can still make some great characters though!

The vehicles have been improved in terms of handling. The driving/flying in SR2 was a little wonky and could be aggravating at times (mostly the flying.) Thankfully they have improved them in SR3. The only drawback is the vehicle customizing is a little lackluster and not very interesting. Like I stated above though, this game just gives you attack choppers and tanks pretty much close to the start of the game, so it makes it too easy.

SR3 has many "Activities" to complete, which all involve driving around killing things, or running around killing things, or just drive around real fast. None of them are really new in terms of the SR2 activities.

The weapons in this game, I felt like they didn't have enough "weight" to them. I personally found them to not feel powerful enough, or feel like I was actually shooting the weapons. They just felt like they were going "pew pew pew" and not much else. I mostly just stuck to using the RPG when I hit infinite ammo just so I could kill people and move on.

The radio stations are great. You have everything from Metal, classical, rock/punk, the Adult Swim station that plays music from the shows like Metalocalypse and Aqua Teen Hunger Force, to pop music as well.

The graphics in this game still hold up today. They still look great and the game runs at a smooth 60FPS. Never had the game crash on me. The world of Steelport has tons of detail in it, like all the clothing stores such as Let's Pretend having a lot of cool stuff in it.

The only problem I really noticed was the sound. I've had where even if an NPC was standing in front of me, the audio from them sounded like it was coming from way behind me. A minor complaint though.

There is a co-op mode to play with a friend... 1 friend though. This has 2 player co-op, which is sad cause this game would have been much better if you were able to have 4 people in a game, even if you were not able to do missions, but just go around the city doing stuff.

Pros:
- Good character creator.
- Good selection of music.
- Great open world.
- Great characters. (Burt Mother F***ing Reynolds!!)
- Ok story.
- Over the top sillyness/action.
- Co-op.
- Easy achievements. (Only took me 46 hours to 100% complete everything.)
- Steam Cards.

Cons:
- Not as strong as Saints Row 2 in many ways.
- Gets very repetitive in terms of being "crazy/over the top."
- Most of the filler is activities and not so much in story.
- Most DLC is pointless or offers very little in terms of content.
- Only has 2 player co-op.
- Can't be a shemale (TRIGGERED)

The game is a solid 8/10 from me. (Saints Row 2 being a 9/10.) If you are looking for a "FUN" open world game that doesn't take things serious, this is a great game to pick up and have fun with a friend.
[h1]Often hilarious and always insane.[/h1]
Games do not always have to be serious and moving themes rolled out a hundred times. [b]Saints Row[/b] is neither serious nor too reasonable, throwing everything on the grate and laughing at everything. And it is in this game beautiful. It is so stupid as to be wonderful.

Briefly, because nobody likes to read much.

[list][b]PROS[/b]
[*]Pretty good story and game length
[*]A multitude of flavors and references to pop culture (Yes, i mean music)
[*]Open-minded
[*]Large, fully open city
[*]A huge quantity of weapons, vehicles capable of modifying
[*]Totally customizable character
[*]Side missions
[*][spoiler]Breast physics, my character's chest sway like there are gale force winds[/spoiler]
[*]Numerous aids and facilities
[*]A large diversity of difficulty
[*]We can hear Hulk Hogan, Sasha Grey, and even Burt Reynolds in the role of mayor of the city
[*]And many, many others...

[b]CONS[/b]
[*]Artificial intelligence, AI
[*]Minor bugs of game engine[/list]
Saints Row: The Third is a really fun game, in which you play the role of leader of the Saints, a rich gang which runs amok throughout the city.
The game is quite reminiscent of Grand Theft Auto.

There's an interesting story-line to follow, which you complete mission by mission - just about all of which involve some shooting or racing around in sporty vehicles (well, maybe some are not so sporty, but they're the exceptions).
There are also various extra missions which you can choose to take on.

Or you may even just choose to zoom around the city in your fast car, doing whatever you want - shooting at other gangs, police, military, or even innocent civilians, heaven forbid.

There is a wide selection of vehicles (cars, trucks, helicopters, planes, etc.), of which you can store a limited number to keep and use again.
You can even modify vehicles to make them hot stuff.
Some vehicles have to be unlocked by doing missions.

There's even a selection of radio stations you can play in your car (although it's a shame that, unlike the later Grand Theft Auto productions, you can't add your own MP3s to the radio).

You can also play Saints Row: The Third in a co-operative mode with a friend.

All in all, it's a game of serious shooting and major mayhem (as well as some not-so-serious shooting and minor mayhem).
However, in the name of greater social responsibility, I suggest that you use your powers only for good in the game - drive your vehicles below the designated speed limit at all times, and help little old ladies across the road - of course, you may succumb to mind-numbing boredom, but that's your lookout.

If you want a fun time, then I can highly recommend this game.
"But I am a method actor!" exclaims Josh and then he leaves. Leaves everybody. In a bank. Where his pals are about to complete a bank robbery. It is hilarious! Hilarious how stupid some of these characters are and the one-liners in Saints Row The 3rd almost equal to the ones in our favourite American films from the '80s or '90s.

Volition made a replica of GTA IV but made a much better version of it. This is a properly optimised game that looks good and runs well on our PCs. And if you thought the script of GTA included a lot of conversations with dozens of jokes you'll immediately forget that game once you get to know the members of the Saints.

The story revolves around the Saints, an always purple-clad gang who has just taken over Steelport (the fake city where the story takes place) but is thriving to achieve more. To further extend their control over the city they must annihilate the mysterious Syndicate who commands the 3 gangs of Steelport. But then again the government does not like the too much bang-bang in the city so a special anti-gang unit is introduced and you will also have to face its leader, a ruthless general.

Gameplay is exactly the same as what you get used to in GTA IV. There are missions initiated by beacons once approached but the main story missions are launched by calling your buddies on your cellphone. Otherwise, you go wherever you want and do whatever you want in the city. Really. I like how the game rewards me if I hit civilians or when driving for a long time on the oncoming lane or when drifting for a long time. 

Remember when Niko hits a car at high speed and flies out of the windshield in GTA IV? Were you laughing hard when that happened just as I did? Well, in Saints Row you have a side mission called "insurance fraud" which means you need to let yourself hit by a car and the more hits you receive the easier it is to fly high (?) and instead of hitting the ground you need to try to hit the hood of another car and so on and so on...the multiplication and the amount of score you receive is enormous! So, you have to be prepared for doing a lot of stupid things with the Saints. This is a must and if you are not up for that you had better quit while you can!

You have collectibles, of course, for the sake of achievements and longevity: you collect cash, sex dolls and drugs. And you can steal vehicles and assassinate people. And you can level-up and spend your hard-earned cash on upgrades. And if you have DLCs you have weapons such as the shark gun that pours blood on people who are then attacked by a shark (yes, the appear from below the asphalt). Stupid fun! You can also have a lot of properties in the city just so you can actually feel like being someone controlling a huge area!

The game is very funny. The cars are fast and fully upgradeable. You can apply upgrades you have never thought of, by the way. Turning on the radio while driving is just as fun as in GTA. You have a dozen tracks available so everyone can find his or her taste. Voice acting is equally good and did I mention Burt Reynolds is the mayor of the city? And that there is a side mission where you drive while a tiger is sitting next to you in the car bothering you?

The story is mediocre at best but really funny. Saints Row is a must and it is one of my all time favourite games!
The best in the series IMO and I've played them all, if you're looking for non stop action and thrills this is the game for you...

If you've enjoyed the craziness from GTA San Andreas then you will love this, online co-op is also a blast to play with a friend, there's lots to do and plenty of customization to keep you satisfied.

The optimization is excellent and can run on pretty decent hardware with the graphics options cranked but there are a couple of random times while in co-op a glitch can happen when you die for a stupid reason and it only happens randomly but non that are a deal breaker, and the campaign length is pretty decent.

Definitely worth the full sticker price now and even better when its in sale, just buy it! You won't regret it!
Basically the last saints row game before it became a full on superhero simulator.



You can buy it on steam and get a DRM free version on GOG if you want.
Thinking about it now, Saints Row 3 mostly feels like a third season of your favorite show. It's shot on better equipment, it's brighter than usual and it tries to to make you think this is a peak of everything. It might feel a little soulless in the end, but for the whole playthrough you don't think about it.
Truly superb game. Completed it 2 times with friend and we had hella fun. It's not as realistic as SR2 but also not as "stupid" as SR4. Overall it's amazing game with lots of funny moments.
Saints Row: The Third is the third in the Saints Row series WHAT A SHOCKER RIGHT ? Well since it's the only surviving GTA clone it is surprising to some. 

As a big fan of the first two games, I was excited to play 3 and to be honest ? I absolutely loved it.

Now before we begin, I got to say something. I think that the first Saints Row game was a very stiff game, but had tons of great ideas which were all fixed in the sequel which I though was amazing.

Saints Row 3 begins almost as soon as 2 ends. The Saints are now international superstars and have tons of merchandise like a clothing line and an energy drink. They can't even rob a bank without getting mobbed by rabid fans wanting an autograph. Saints getting so many fans brings them new enemies called the Syndicate. They push the Saints out of Stilwater and push them into Steelport a town they're not that familiar with, but they will do everything in they're power to take it over.

Now when I first bought the game I was pushed away, by Angry Joe who called the game a massive disappointment and other people calling it a massive misstep in the series. I finally decided to sit down and play and I got to say, I don't understand how the game is disappointing.

Gone are the reputation points, the stiff shooting is gone, the stiff driving is gone. The only bad things is that there's no gang missions. There's no separate gangs anymore, just a big gang which takes away the interesting characters in all gangs. 

The comedy is also highly improved in this game. I felt the comedy in the first one worked well and fun jokes when they happened. I felt 2 had funny jokes, but they were trying too hard to be emotional and funny at the same time which didn't really mesh with the tone of the game. 3 fixes this problem and just goes off rails and it works charms for the series.

The soundtrack is also pretty decent. Nothing too special, I still think the second game had a better soundtrack, but it's still pretty decent.

Graphically this game looks amazing. I like the neon visuals and I feel they fixed the problem in saints row 2 which was that it was colorful and at the same time colorless.

The game took me 15 hours to finish the main story and all the story DLC's. I feel it was a good amount of time for what I paid for it and you can get the game pretty cheap on sale.

Overall I loved Saints Row 3. The wacky world of Steelport while might seem boring at first has things to do and you can do them in the most Action packed ways possible which provides hours of fun.

Final Rating:
8.5/10

Pros:
+ Incredibly Funny
+ Fixed gameplay from the previous titles

Cons:
-One gang removes the possibility of interesting gang bosses. 

Best of the four by far. Gameplay, story, and unique artstyle all come together for one fun package. About ~20 hours with DLC and cost me about 3 dollars total, a steal for a game.
Only by the trailer with a song Power-Kanye West if fucking speaks this game is fuck!
For those who have played Saints Row 1-2, know that The Third is not a continuation, but there are facts in the game reminiscent of the past of the gang, but anyway the game is very manero, fun, the story until it is Good, but do not take it as seriously as the previous titles.
But buy fun guaranteed for you and the whole family!

But just remembering about the DLC, I recommend buying because it makes the game more fun!
[h1][b]Saints Row: The Third - Review[/b][/h1]
Saints Row: The Third is a third person shooter taking place in the open world city of Steelport. It's a game that doesn't really take itself too seriously which is either a good or bad thing for some and the graphics are cartoonish to go along with the humor of the game which might fall flat for some people at times.

In Steelport you'll be spending your time either completing the missions, doing activities and finding the collectables, or going around the city causing mayhem. The story itself is based around getting revenge for someone and thats about it, lasting roughly 10+ hours. To make it even worse; Saints Row 4 basically renders every action you did during this game entirely pointless. However the missions themselves are pretty enjoyable, and the interactions between the characters are interesting despite not being too fleshed out. 

While the story isn't too particularily compelling and the game's humor and graphics may not appeal to everyone, Saints Row: The Third is solid overall and pretty fun to play by yourself or with a friend. It occassionally goes on sale for $3.74 and it's definitely worth purchasing for that amount.

[h1][b]Pros:[/b][/h1]
► Fun single player and co-op gameplay experience
► Lots of customization options for your character, gang members and cars
► Variety of missions
► Interesting characters
► Many Activities to do and secrets to find 
► Upgrade system (guns, character, homies)
► The timing for the songs / tracks bring out the feeling of a scene, especially the final mission
► Solid controls

[h1][b]Cons:[/b][/h1]
► Linear progression in the plot, where as the first two games would let you choose the order you could take out the gangs
► Story isn't particularily interesting or compelling
► Acheivement hunters won't be able to 100% due to the character gallary being down 
► No cutscene replay option as with the first two games
► The city itself is particularily dull and lifeless
► Stuck with any upgrades choices you make, can't switch them on or off

[h1][b]Hit / Miss:[/b][/h1]
► Humor is a hit or miss for some people
► Few one time only choices that affect bonuses you'll recieve, but otherwise won't affect the storyline
► Upgrading too much may ruin your experience if you want a challenge

Where do I even begin with this gem of a game?  This is by far my favorite out of the Saints Row series (I loved them all actually).  Stilwater is happily ruled by the Saints, so it makes sense that they expand their operation in a city where they are already pop culture icons... Steelport.  Go through mission after mission as you take down the rival gang factions and solidify your position as the #1 gang!  

Let's start with the storyline.  It is one you would expect from Volition.  It is over the top, outrageous, and above all... completely fun.  Between online and offline playtime, I've put well over 500 hours into this game.  I have to say the gang faction I have the most fun taking down is the Luchadores, simply because I can't stand their leader.  Well that, and they are the most fun to headshot when you are completing challenges.  The storyline itself makes sure that you will explore almost all of Steelport, which is fine by me since exploring is one of my requirements in an open world setting.  While the game does have its share of serious moments, there is a lot of comedy in here as well.  As the leader of the Saints, you come well equipped with sarcasm and a serious handicap when it comes to any kind of technology talk.  With the exception of a few voice choices when you are making your boss, all the voice acting from the boss and all other characters are totally on point.

There are a ton of side quests in this game (Professor Genki FTW).  You have everything from stealing cars and hostage driving, to driving around prostitutes while they service their clients.  Gang operations are everywhere so there is no shortage of chances to piss off the enemy.  I have to say that pissing off S.T.A.G. is probably the best.  They just pile up so well, that blowing them away with an RPG is satisfying.  There is no shortage of weapons in this game.  You can use everything from a d*ck bat, to UAV Drones.  Typically I stuck with the good old fashioned .45, but at some point you will use almost all (if not all) of the weapons throughout your playtime.  You will also acquire quite a few safehouses during the story.  Safehouses are always great if you are trying to escape the ton of cops or gang members that are dead set on sending you home in a body bag.  The bigger safehouses also provide a few perks as well, so it is definitely worth your time to upgrade any safehouse that can be upgraded.  

While this is a small annoyance, I found that there were issues getting the sounds your car makes while driving to actually play.  Ultimately I had to fix it by downloading the VLC Media Player, and having it open during game play.  That fixed all the sound issues.  Whether you are playing alone, or going co-op, this game is beyond fun.  It is worth full price, but the Saints Row series tends to go on sale a lot, so look out for that too.
If you like openworld Games this is just the right Game for you. In This Game you can do nearly everything you want, unrealistic and realistic things. I liked this Game very much, cause you got much possibilities in the Game. A nice thing is also, that you can choose during the campagne what you want to do and you can deside on which way you want the campagne to continue.
Do I really need to write long review about Saints Row The Third? It's awesome game and hours of fun in single & multiplayer mode. Minus is 40% of main missions are just tutorials. We have really nice Steelport and huge amount of items to find, activities to do and... DLCs to buy. I must buy Season Pass. Other DLCs are just bonus cars and clothes. Also there are some awesome characters (like Zimos XD) and really good missions (like deckers.die.). I really recommend this game.
Saints Row: The Third is an over the top but very entertaining open world action comedy game.  Having never played a Saints Row game before I was delighted by the Grand Theft Auto style, but with a more exaggerated and excessive nature.  This game is meant to be enjoyed and not taken too seriously.  There is plenty of lewd and crazy content which results in maximum pleasure and very little boredom.  

The campaign is fun and not too difficult, though the story is somewhat forgettable and takes a back seat to all the ridiculous action.  Practically everything you do earns you street cred and cash to allow you to take over rival gang territories, buy upgrades, weapons, and funny outfits.  When making your character there is a lot of customization that can be done which really personalizes the gameplay.  The city of Steelport is a nice sized playground with tons of fun activities and areas to take over giving this game longevity and replayability.  The graphics are good but nothing breathtaking.  There are some pop-ins while driving and some jagged edges here and there. Overall the game still is pleasing to the eye, there are a lot of bright lights, neon colors, and cool effects.  Sometimes the streets did fell a bit lifeless though and in some areas I did not feel totally immersed.  

The soundtrack is very good and has a nice array of tunes for you to jam to while exploring and causing havoc.  Some of the dialogue in this game is hilarious and other times a tad forced, still it only adds to the level of extremity.  The controls felt smooth and precise.  Shooting down waves of enemies with some very bizare weaponry is just pure fun. The Smart Phone is a great in game feature that can deliver cool vehicles to you, round up some homies, play coop at an ease, and plenty of other in game options.  Playing coop is a blast and you will have someone to share all the laughs and thrills of this game.  From start to finish I had a great time playing Saints Row: The Third, and I highly recommend it for anyone who just likes to have fun, shoot, and blow things up.

This was my first saints row game. I used to talk shit about this game series without even playing it, I bought it to expand my game library and also a lot of my friends owned it.
Now its one of my favorite games :) 
If you want a balls to wall kind of fun game this is it :D
Play it alone, Play it co op with a buddy so much fun :)
This game is easily one of the best games I have played in my life. This game is basically a much much much better version of GTA V. It has lots of fun DLC to use and mess around with even after you complete the game. What makes this game even better then GTA V is that it has lots of collectables to find, side missions to do, lots of challenges to spend your time completing and assassination missions.

If you love the GTA series, you will love this game 50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000x more then it.

GET THIS GAME. IT IS REALLY WORTH IT.

If you want to get Saints Row IV since it is the latest installment to the Saints Row Series, I don't recommend as much as I do to this. It just dosen't have the same feel.
>opens up random mission
>suddenly gets thrown inside a random room, all naked and with drunk camera
>"kill these dudes" the goal tells me to
>proceeds at doing it, while also disabling things and opening up cages
>all of a sudden, big dude with machine gun pops up as a some sort of boss, in a garage
>throws grenade and everything's blown up, including him
>"mission complete"
I tell ye, this game is good.

[h1]"The third street Saints are back!"[/h1]

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
My story with Saints Row 3 started back in high school. Let's just say that I was a really stubborn kid who didn't want to play any GTA game at all. I used to think it was a stupid overrated game that everyone loved for some reason. Now, of course, that was years ago and today I am a different person who loves GTA games. But all those years ago I had heard of a game called Saints Row. It sounded interesting so a classmate sold me his copy of Saints Row 3, I went home after school and gave it a go. Let's just say that I really loved it. It was my first Saints Row game and to be honest, this entry was a good introduction to the series for me.

Saints Row 3 is basically a more wacky and silly version of GTA, while GTA tends to take itself seriously and remain within the realm of reality. Saints Row replicates the gameplay of GTA whilst at the same time making it a silly and fun game with a very interesting narrative.

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
You and your crew are gearing up for a bank heist in the fictional city of Steelport in the state of Michigan. The people of Steelport are used to this and instead of hiding and panicking, they start taking pictures and selfies with the gang members of the Third Street Saints since well... The Third Street Saints are a popular gang with big media influence. Yea it's a bit crazy, after a shootout with rival gang members who own the bank, a silent alarm is turned on by a certain individual and you now have to fight through waves of S.W.A.T before getting arrested, your story from that point of the game will start. 

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
● Interesting narrative
● Gameplay
● Quite a big weapon pool
● Good character design
● Achievements
● Steam trading cards
● Customizable player character
● Soundtrack
● Decent driving mechanics
● Lots of side activities
● Great DLC
● Good price [b](You can pick up the full game plus every DLC for as low as £2.74!)[/b]
● Funny moments

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
● Performance [b](SR3 is one of those old games where you will have a better time running it on an older PC rather than a brand new PC with the latest technology. It just simply isn't optimized for newer hardware, now while I was able to maintain a decent framerate ranging from 60 to 70 fps, the game did have performance issues. Sometimes the fps would drop to 44 or even 30 fps and it would stay locked at 30 fps until I restarted the game. On top of that, I would occasionally get hard stutters and there was no option for me to fix it.)[/b]

● Side activities [b](Some of the side activities like escort or trafficking are just poorly designed and probably not playtested at all. For an instance, this one escort side activity will have you avoiding news vans but the problem is that there is like a billion news vans spawning the instant you pick up the client and they will all pile up onto you and ram into you, if you're in a tunnel then you're f**ked. Some other missions like trafficking are a pain to complete because the AI in SR3 is beyond brain-dead and the game will spam you with so many enemies that you will feel like you're in the Vietnam War with all of the explosions going off.)[/b]

● Damage animations [b](Some enemies will use flamethrowers and the developers thought it was a good idea to put in an animation where your player character will scream that he is on fire and walk around without your control. The problem with this is the enemies will never stop shooting or burning you which means that you will be stuck in an animation loop with no way of getting out unless you distant yourself from the enemy or you die completely.)[/b]

● Props [b](Well SR3 has a lot of explosive weapon options, it's not too bad but the problem is with the props. You will be attempting to run away from an enemy attack only to have a f**king lamp post fall down on you forcing you to jump over. Not exactly a big problem but it is a frustrating feature that honestly makes no sense in why it was added.)[/b]

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Well, my conclusion is that Saints Row 3 is a great game, it has a fun narrative with a pretty good gameplay and for the price of £2.74 on a sale, I can't complain. It is filled with great characters and even for someone like myself who hasn't played a single Saints Row game before Saints Row 3. I was easily able to get into the storyline and understand everything that is happening. Saints Row 3 is filled with content that will most definitely keep you playing for quite some time. Wherever that may filling out assassination contracts or stealing vehicles or even taking over the entire city. Saints Row 3 is a game that will for sure keep you playing for quite some time. Great game that is worth the full price or if you're patient enough then you can wait for a sale and get an even better price. 

[h1]Overall rating 9/10[/h1]
When the GTA series started becoming more serious, the Saints Row series chose to appease the other half of us by becoming more ridiculous and over the top.  Saints Row the Third is as whacky, immature and over the top as it gets, giving you absurdly powerful rewards in a short time, loads of upgradeable weapons, tons of car mod opportunities and an un-hindered tag along co-op mode, allowing for even higher levels of hilarity with a friend.  The story however may feel disjointed and lack context at times, plus, some will find their rewards less special because they get so many so quickly.  That isn't always bad however, because some of us just want to start going nuts as quick as possible, taking to the streets with a friend and delivering an underhanded rocket launcher swing to the groin of a man wearing a mascot costume.  This game is not for the easily offended or those who like a slow boil, but it welcomes those like myself who was bored by GTA4's lack of sandbox wonder.
412 Hours. Tons of Fun Mods. Actions speak louder than Words. Seeing is Believing.
𝐆ameplay with ⅯODS, Enjoy!

In my opinion the second best game of Saints Row series. Brings more ridiculousness and more tuned mechanics than its former part. Great comedy packed with explosions and interesting story.
Driving, shooting and slapping people with phallic objects, all feel satisfying and responsive.
Great character customization allowing both good-looking characters and monsters that should never exist.
The game itself is fairly long. I played through main story and DLCs in my playtime + a couple of misc side stuff and there's still quite a lot to do.
Overall it's one of the best comedy games I've ever played and I'm not afraid to give it 10/10.

[i]Saints Row[/i], the video game series both adored and despised for its omnipresent cruel and bizzare humour, had been known mainly for attempting to seize the idea of gang warfare popularized with the release of 2004's [i]Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas[/i], but the release of the third installment of the adventures of Third Street Saints cranked the scale of absurdity and action up to eleven, with an entirely new setting and much larger threats.


[h1][b]The Premise[/b][/h1]

Several years after the merge of Third Street Saints and the media giant Ultor, the formers' fame skyrocketed, so much so that the gang manages to combine its presence in the world both as an influential media figure and a notorious gathering of ill-minded individuals, with hostages lining up for autographs whenever they rob a bank. Such was the case with the Stillwater's 1st National Bank, before the heist went south and the gang was captured. Not only did they lose their take, but they also tipped off the Syndicate - a conglomerate of various gangs from around the world eager to take the place and the wealth of the Saints. With the rival gangsters and the police to worry about, the Saints have to make a name for themselves in the new city of Steelport...


[h1][b]The Gameplay & Graphics[/b][/h1]

The game moving to a new engine helped alleviate various issues the former installments experienced, with clunky controls and animations now a matter of days gone by. Smoother animations and more solid gunplay allow for the game to be more welcoming both to newbies and veterans of the series. One of the main features of the game is its perks, which range from handy little tools to useful skills to downright cheating, with potential for the player to become a much more talkative Terminator, what with never-depleting ammo, stamina and health, which if done correctly can be achieved midway into the game. Never does it take the fun out, however, as the absurdity of [i]Saints Row: The Third[/i], as well as the ability to experience it in coop with a friend, always helps create unique and unforgettable moments. 

The visual part of the game, while not [i]Crysis[/i]-level groundbreaking, deserves to be mentioned, given that the final product looks much more lively compared to the two previous installemnts of the series.


[h1][b]The Customization[/b][/h1]

This is where the game really shines: from the main character to the vehicles and the weapons - everything can be personalised and made however ridiculous one's mind and soul allow them to, with some player-created avatars, for instance, being prime examples of an unlikely scenario of what would happen if Shrek were to escape his swamp, do drugs and become a feminist - and that's before such an abomination is given a voice, of which there are seven. Later on, it is in due order to see the bikini-clad monstrosity riding around on a pink futuristic with a laser SMG and spewing nonsense with a distinct Russian accent. The impressive collection of vehicles one can own is also subject to customization, with street sweepers being turned into zombie apocalypse vehicles and military jeeps getting golden rims and purple paintjobs, and that is before one gets their hands on a belt-fed assault rifle with an underbarrel grenade launcher!


[h1][b]The Summary[/b][/h1]

Under no circumstances should such a masterpiece of absurdity go unnoticed, and given its meager base price dropping even lower during the frequent sales, it would be a crime to walk past this game.
This Game Is Some Mush Funny With Friends And One Of The Best Game I Have Ever Played 
And Make Me Laugh When I Play It xD.
Every Thing Is Good : Graphic - Customisation - GamePlay - Skills.
And The Best Saints Row: The Third Among The Others.
Buy This Game If It In Sell
Saints Row: The Third gives the people what they want and drops us into an open world adult theme park where we can treat ourselves to delightful acts of bloodshed and perversion. It doesn't take itself too seriously and only asks that you don't, either.
Beat it in 2013, it's a great game without any doubt.

Sadly, the server now has been shut down, and due to the game constantly trying to reconnect to the server that is no longer avaiable, the game will freeze about 5 sec every 20 to 30 sec or so, making it impossible to run smoothly, letting alone having fun from it.

To solve it, either play it under steam offline mode or play a cracked version. Either way means saying goodbye to play time record and achievement.

I wish to, but I will not expect the dev will release an update to fix this problem for a game that was published about eight years ago. 

Edit: A friend of mine offered me an available solution: 
" Put "208.67.222.222 sr3.hydra.agoragames.com" in file hosts and you can play just fine without offline steam mode. Dont know about coop, but probably will work. "

Thank him and thank whoever came up with this solution. And I turn my thumb down to thumb up.
Great alternative with GTA, bonus points to having multiplayer. While GTA is focused more on realism and accuracy of enviroments, Saints Row series aren't, and that's why they're batsh*t insane with action and storyline. These games are video game forms of all the s**t you see on websites like Adult Swim and Newgrounds. Therefore, expect A LOT of adult topics and jokes. Huge variety of customization, freedom and armageddons, and being that I completed it in co-op together with a bro, I recommend it fully, especially to play it with your (dirty-minded jacka*s) buddies.

Keep in mind:
Graphics may get a good rating even when it's old-school/pixel art. That depends on how visually pleasing it is.
okay ight baby this game is the  s h  i t i tell you like its so awesome i died laughing at the cutscenes i love the new charcters such as oleg i really like the celebirty type gangs and the last missions DONT PLAY SAINTS ROW 4 FUCK THAT GAME PLAY SAITNS THE THIRD ITS THE BEST

The Saints Row franchise may have ridden on the coattails of GTA, but Saints Row 3 is, for me, the apex for either franchise. Beyond the gratuitous violence, language, and sexual themes (who knew it would be a riot to attack people with a 3' long dildo called "The Penetrator"?), this game is filled with humor, it's incredibly fun to play, and I daresay it's also quite clever.
Lots of action, fun, interesting game with good humour. Just replayed it after 5-6 years, and if u can get it on the lower price u should do it definitely.
it's like gta, but no (fun parody at those type of game with action and "O_O what did they smoke" moment )
Must play with a couple of friends and especially one who can drive a car/boat/helicopter/plane ))) it will help a little

A wonderful hilarious take on the Open World Third Person Shooter genre, what started one day as a GTA clone, transcended all common sense, to become the first of its kind. A blast to play alone, or with company, a game that is guaranteed to give you lots of fun.
This is from another Steam Review (KWOM) 

Reasons not to use Epic Store:
1) They have terrible security (80 million accounts were exposed last week)
2) They have terrible customer service (just google it)
3) Games are more expensive on Epic due to regional pricing
4) You can't play games offline
5) Limited social features
6) No screenshots
7) No controller support
8) They broke EU laws (and still do)
9) Scummy tactics (you had to tick a box to opt out of emails etc)
10) They are partially owned by Tencent (a company that sells user data to the Chinese government)
11) No achievements
12) No cloud saves
13) No game forums (many people went to steam for subnautica support)
14) Epic make you pay the transaction fee when purchasing games
15)They are anti-consumer (They pay for exclusive rights to games to try and force you to use their store)
16) They can refuse refunds even if you meet the criteria
17) No reviews
18) No Linux support

All this alone should let everyone know about the current situation with Metro Exodus and Deep Silver.
MOST CANCEROUS GAME EVER


Complete downgrade from 1 and 2, quest enemies have more health than they should have, and the combat is cancerous, glad this series died out.

go buy a GTA Game instead or the previous entries, whoever made this game is basically braindead.
