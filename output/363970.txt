It's not pay to win... it's not pay to play... it's a great game to idle with if you enjoy strategy/rpg (having an interest in math also makes it more interesting for me.) Definitely use an autoclicker--don't break your mouse. The fun is what ISN'T clicking (upgrading heroes, speccing ancients/outsiders, trying to figure out which hero is a dude or not cuz they all have breasts.)

It's free, has tons of achievements, is well-made and addictive. You can also expert and import save games if you'd like to try other people's builds.

I wouldn't play it without an autoclicker (usually autohotkey is ideal for this--and scripts are readily available on community)
A horrifying examination of human psychological weakness, Clicker Heroes is more disturbingly [i]respectable[/i] than clear satire such as Progress Quest for being a fully realized and quite serious effort of game design, but it is not to be played—it is to be hooked up to a computer in a museum where children can go and watch it [i]work[/i] (from behind the safety of a thick glass shield) so that they might return home motivated by recurring nightmares which serve to forever remind them of the ease with which a person can be seduced into wasting their life.

If we ever manage to build utopia, the cornerstone of its educational program will be a forced hour-long session of Clicker Heroes that ends with students being informed that their genetic sequence has been inextricably attached to their game profile and that they will be unceremoniously exiled to labor camps on the Moon if they should ever demonstrate the feeble-mindedness necessary to return and play for a second time.

When the human race is finally enslaved by its mechanical progeny and harvested within illusory biofarm prison-paradises, our digital overlords will have no need of an elaborate computer simulation to placate our minds; for that they will have Clicker Heroes.

It is a masterpiece of modern art and social engineering, one of the crowning accomplishments of all mankind.  Now get the hell away from it.
Screw this game. 
Like, I've actually played it since 2014. I've wasted so much time just clicking for no reason at all. It's so pointless but addictive at the same time, and even though I knew this all along, I kept playing.
Man, I wanna break out of this bottomless pit of mental torture. Every day, I feel I'm getting closer and some day soon I will break out. I gotta believe in myself..

Please, if you love yourself, play something else.
This game is a chore.
You just play.  
You don't like it but you do it.
You just play.
You don't think about it.  
You just play.  
There is no goal.
You just play.
There is no fun.

[h1] Short Review [/h1] [i] Incl. your savior	[/i]

[b] Pros	[/b]
+ It's on Steam.
+ Great artwork for an incremental game.
+ Build muscles for your finger.
+ Still earn gold when you AFK to buy a new mouse.

[b] Cons	[/b]
- It can destroy your life once you click play.
- There is no cure for that.

So yeah I've put a bit of time into this game... It's a pretty fun and well-designed, chill clicker game. It does go, uh, pretty far, though. Like... there are achievements in the game which, mathematically speaking, take years to get, just to give y'all an idea. And there are a few points where you'll just be up against a wall.

I've made it a goal to retire after hitting level 10000, crawling my way up ever so gradually with the help of Wepwawet and Midas...  and now I'm leveling Tsuichi and man it is taking forever to get to the next Ancient.

I know that last paragraph probably didn't make a whole lot of sense if you haven't played the game, so why not play it and see what I mean? It's free, so why not!?

I've officially lost complete control of my sanity by having played this game simply to say I managed to get 100% achievements without an autoclicker  and played in active mode - 16+ million clicks over the course of 135 days where I've left it running or been playing it off and on 24 hours a day.  No idea why I felt driven to complete this game.   

The only saving grace is ... I'll get back to you once I figure one out.  

I think that says it all.
For starters, I would highly recommend this game. As far as idle/incremental games it's one of the better ones I've seen. The devs interact with players, updates are done relatively frequently, and the game is very bright and cheerful. It even has some (minor) lore aspects, a bit of story is told, though if you're looking for a game centered around story, this is probably not it.

Recently, patch 1.0 came out bringing Clicker Heroes into its first full version. There's been a lot of knee-jerk reactions with a new system (transcendence) that came out with 1.0, in which you trade in most of what you have for some mechanics that greatly speed up your game. Because the very first run after this "transcending" is very slow, there has been some negative reactions towards the game. Most people who have spent the couple hours that it takes to get back into the soul gain levels have found the update very enjoyable, whereas those who quit tend to not spend those couple hours. Please take those reviews with a grain of salt! The game does have its problems, but transcendence is not one of them.

Edit: For anyone wondering, I have a large amount of time spent on this game because it's an idle game. I leave it open full time to idle through it.

Edit 2: A few updates have come out since my review. Primarily, "offline" (as in, when the game is closed) progression was added, which makes it much easier to play this game casually.
Great way to pass the time at work. The mouse clicking makes it seem like I'm really working hard. The addictive nature of the game means I will be at my desk all day ignoring distractions from other people. The only downside is the carpel tunnel syndrome you'll develop, but it's a small price to pay for being endlessly entertained!
I'm making this review a week into the game. 

I have 62 hours played. (168 hours in a week, 37% of the week)

Day 1) I saw a free game/indie game, my 2 weaknesses. I didn't stop playing the entire day.

Day 2) I changed my steam name and icon to the beloved Treebeast.

Day 3) I spread the Clicker Heroes plague to all my friends.

Day 4) No one can stop.

Day 5) We are in Skype calls, silent, except for the sounds of furious clicking.

Day 6) I quit my job.

Day 7) I blink for the first time in 2 days. Remarkable. I realize now how serious this has gotten. I look around me. Dirty        clothes, Doritos bags, dog shit, a ruined home, Clicker Heroes. I ignore my surroundings and persevere onward.

10/10   Join the plague.
It's more than just clicking. 

In fact, if you simply click you're doing it wrong. This game is all about building a strategy then realizing you've wasted your life playing a game in which you watch the computer click on monsters.
So after a few hours of this game i still havn't been able to unlock all the achivements.
But prob will get there soon. It's a fun game. Kinda time consuming. Still loads to do in it for me.
I rate it a solid 5/7.
I respect this game for the things it has taught me, such as:

- How to find the best deals for buying new mouses to replace broken old ones
- Write my own script to program my mouse to click 1000 times a second 
- Not to use that script on an old laptop that can barely run Minecraft 
- Not to bring my laptop to the bathroom and play on the toilet for an hour straight

Before starting this game I had a wife two kids and a dog in a nice house with a well-paid job. After killing millions of monsters with the power of my mouse Im left with nothing but my mission to reach the final zone... But it's fine... I've found the true meaning of life. Just one more click and I'll be done ... one ... more ... 
10/10
This game is not a game. It is an addiction. It is like a drug. Sure it may seem harmless at first. It may even be fun. "It's free? What's wrong with it?" you ask yourself cautiously before loading it up. But when you start playing it seems harmless. The concept is simple and the enemies are cartoons. Surely you will get bored with this in one day right?
But then the next day you go back for more. Just for a bit. What's this? You have more money? The game keeps going even while you are away just minding your own business. Once you get to a higher level you realize you can send mercs out to just get rubies for you. Just a little in the morning. Just a little when you get home. Let me just set this up before bed. Over a thousand hours later you realize... this game will never end. 

Never.
Please help me.
I got this game somewhere between two days and two years ago. Hard to tell. Most of my time has been spent playing it. My arm hurts from clicking, there's a feral creature shrieking persistently in my skull, and my mouse seems to have taken to sobbing silently when I get to a boss level. I'm only writing this to give myself a brief reprieve from the game. Even now it's still open, whispering softly and seductively to me, bending me slowly backwards with its long, icy fingers. This game is my drug, and I can't fucking stop clicking. It has me trapped, helpless, teaching me hundreds of new ways to be addicted to something. Clicker Heroes is the dark, divine deity to which cocaine and heroin pray. If you find this, contact los federales, or mi madre, I'm frightened and afraid of what Clicker Heroes might do to me.

8/8
Tested this out a little.
A fun clicker game. Easy to get into and unlike many other free-to-play games does not require any purchases at all to progress or play all content.
Supports active and passive playstyles.
Before you try this game, ask yourself these questions:

Do you love yourself?

Do you love your family?

Do you love your friends?

Do you love when it's summer (to the Québécois) and you can enjoy the warmth of the sun outside?

If you said yes to at least ONE of these questions, stay the hell away from this game.

Otherwise... enjoy. :-)


Clicker Heroes


Another game people will either love (for unknown reasons) or simply disregard due to its nature.


[b][u]The game in a nutshell[/u][/b]

You click on static monsters and each click will deal damage. When the monster dies it drops gold. You accumulate gold and purchase upgrades which makes your clicking stronger. Monsters only vary in visual display and have no abilities or resists. Only an ever increasing pool of health which is depenant on the zone level. Killing 10 monsters in a zone level will open up the next zone level. Every 10 zone levels there are Bosses. Special monsters with much more health which only give you a timewindow of 30 seconds to beat before they restet to full health and the time window starts anew. You must kill these in order to progress and can see them as "benchmarks" to check if you are ready or not.

Apart from active play the game will simulate your progress (measured by your DPS, not clicking damage) even if you are offline tho you cannot progress passively (yet). Entering the next zone is an active thing but if you are missing out on gold to purchase that next upgrade you can let it run in offline mode for an hour or two and continue from there.


[b][u]going deeper[/u][/b]

Clicking is only your first layer tho. You quickly open up new heroes which provide you with your second layer of gameplay. DPS aka Damage Per Second. These heroes deal damage over time on their own. Even if you stop clicking damage will continue to pour in. So DPS is kind of like a passive buff for your game. Apart from buying heroes to become active (first purchase to level 1) you can continue leveling them up to make their DPS stronger in turn enhancing your killing power of the monsters on the screen. 

In addition each hero has a set of abilities which unlock at certain levels (10, 25, 50, 75 and 100) providing better capabilities or ACTIVE ABILITIES


[b][u]it becomes more then mindless clicking[/u][/b]

There are 9 active abilities you can trigger at any point. Each one has an effect duration (usually 30 seconds) and a cool-down preventing you from spamming them. Effects range from more click damage to more gold per kill to support buffs and even a permanent damage buff. Unlocking these abilities and timing their use will become a key part of defeating higher level Bosses


[b][u]it just doesnt stop[/u][/b]

There will be a point where you ll run into a "wall". Monsters will become so powerfull that it takes a long time to kill them and bosses will eventually become so mighty that you will be unable to beat them even if you use all your active abilities. This is the point where you use the "Ascension" feature for the first time.

At first it doesnt sound like anything anybody in his right mind would do. "Creates a new universe, much like the current one. This will restart your game and you will receive XXX Hero Souls".

Wait.....It just resets my game to level one....all gold and hero levels are gone and I simply start over? LAME!!!!!!

But wait....whats these hero souls then?


[b][u]Hero Souls....the meta game[/u][/b]

Hero Souls are kind of a permanent currency coming through an ascension. Each one you have banked (read....showing in your display) will increase your damage by 10%. Its accumulative so if you have 5 your whole damage will increase by 50%. With 10 of these babies you ll DOUBLE your damage. So even tho you have to go through all the levels you beat beforehand a second time.....THIS time will be far easier and much quicker to get to the point where you grinded to a stop before and continue past that point.

And thats not all. As a permanent currency they open up the market for a special sort of heroes. The Ancients.


[b][u]Ancient Heroes....the game turns tactical[/u][/b]

What makes these heroes special is that they also....just like Hero Souls transfer through an ascension and you gonna keep them. There is a whole list of them and each one buffs your game in a special way. Purchasing them costs hero souls. Leveling them up costs hero souls and you ll need to start thinking about what will give you the most bang for your buck (read....do you keep the HS banked or do you invest them?)

You ll soon realize that many ancients support each other so getting the "right mix" of ancients can massively increase your efficiency at going through the treadmill (ascend and go through all those levels again).


[b][u]The truth comes out...whats it all about[/u][/b]

Now the game shows its true color. With all these features unlocked you are ready for the neverending(!) "management and improvement of resources" to push further on a new try which makes so many other genres successfull.

4x
RTS
RPGs
ARPGs
Economy Simulations

If you enjoy any of these genres chances are you ll LOVE clicker heroes. Its free to play so what do you have to lose?



Me...I find myself booting it up almost every day and even tho I ascended more then a hundred times already it doesnt really get old. The asciension is more like a "test run" by now to see if you made the correct choices on spending your hero souls and which ancients to get and level. Its this "game within game" which makes me come back....certainly not the clicking. Theres some form of "grinding" to get enough HS but many games have this so not really a problem.

Its a most simple game and the fact that its so addictive is baffling in itself.

For myself I can say that its been a great way to "waste" my freetime so far. I dont regret picking it up :)
People giving negative reviews because of the new update when they didn't even READ the patch notes.

Transcendence IS worth it and it will make you much more powerful in very little time, just do yourself a favor and read the patch notes and pinned threads on the forum/reddit.

Remember your first ascension? Was it worth it? Then transcend, it's the same feeling. After the first ascension in transcendence you will be drowning in HS, it's amazing.

"Ascension is for increasing velocity at the cost of position, transcension is for increasing acceleration at the cost of both velocity and position" - Asminthe.

This is actually a game made by a collection of Mouse making companies so that you break your mouse and have to buy a new one. Also, my girlfriend has noticed a difference in our love making ever since I've played this game.

[b] Review [/b]
       Clicker Heroes is a great background game or a game to play when your watching tv. At first it is very easy to progress and it becomes much faster once you get a couple of Hero Souls by Ascending. There is alot more strategy than one might expect from a free game. You must decide who to upgrade, which skills to buy, which things to spend you Hero Souls on, which things to spend your Ancient Souls on, when to Ascend, when to Transcend, which heroes to Gild, what missions to send your mercenary, to revive or bury your mercenary, which clan to join, and much more! A great game to just waste some time without spending money. It's free, why not give it a try?

Legitimately a great game, and not at all what it appears at first glance.

That's true of any good clicker, but this one in particular is a long and interesting fight through a huge collection of powerups, bonuses, and tradeoffs. It is NOT a game you play by clicking your mouse constantly (or even often), and it's also not a game you'll necessarily want to leave running in the background. This is a game you genuinely play.

A typical session consists of only a minute or two of clicking monsters, then some sorting of treasure; a few decisions about which heroes, artifacts, or demigods to level up; a handful of silly but fun distractions, and contemplation or planning for the next ascension. This last is a prestige-style restart where you cash in your earnings ("hero souls") for a considerable DPS bonus, which you can then use to get past the next hurdle (difficult bosses, expensive heroes). If you don't mind sacrificing some of the direct DPS boon, you can spend your hero souls leveling up your demigods and applying bonuses to your heroes.

None of this requires impressive math skills, but it definitely scratches an itch somewhere, and people with impressive math skills have poured their hearts out in countless guides and theorycraft articles. Most importantly, there's a gut-level fun to the whole thing once you get in a ways. I'm tempted to make a Busy Box comparison, except for the game's one real failing, which is in the sound department. Very few sound effects, and one song on repeat forever. With more bells and whistles and a few extra tunes, Clicker Heroes would be damned near perfect. For the time being, it's probably the only game I've ever made a habit of playing with the sound completely turned off. And I still love it.

∞-1 grandmas out of ∞.
Well I can say after 17.5k Hours on Clikcer Heroes that this "clicker" game is the best. Ive tried numerous  clicker styled games and Clicker Heroes is where its at. Whether you like to play idle or active or even hybrids there is a clicker style for you. So come and sell your soul to the clicker Gods! Ascend to higher plains of existence. But wait... who cares about Ascending when you can Transcend time.
Clicker games are typically shit and clicker heroes is certainly garbage. However, if you're into these mindless clicker games than Clicker Heroes is what I’d suggest. It’s at the top of the trash can.
DO NOT play this STUPID game, you WILL get addicted to it and it is the dumbest thing in the world, it is like crack...you will stop going to work abandon your wife and kids and stay up for 48 hours straight.  You have been warned.
As far as idle/clicker games go, this is my favourite so far.

The community (on reddit) is pretty great, and will help you out a lot if you aren't a math major.

There has been pretty continuous development for the duration of the game's life, so it hasn't gotten stale, and I haven't yet gotten the feeling that there's nothing left to do.
If you want to improve at maths, play this game. It's more about calculation to figure out the best DPS and fastest way to gain "hero souls" than it is about clicking.

The way it works, you get a whole bunch of heroes. The first one improves your click damage, and all other heroes do DPS, which is an acronym that stands for Damage Per Second. Literally, they do damage automatically and you don't need to do anything for it. You increase their level to make them do more damage using gold dropped by monsters you kill. At certain levels, a new skill unlocks which gives effects ranging from increasing that hero's damage by 100%, or increasing overall DPS by all your heroes by 25%, increasing your click damage by a certain percentage of your heroes' total DPS (which is actually the brunt of your click damage), etc. Some of them teach a skill. There are nine skills in the game. For example, Clickstorm is a skill that automatically does 10 clicks per second for 30 seconds, with a 10 minutes cooldown. Proper use of skills is important to kill monsters faster. Especially because...

There are bosses. You have 30 seconds to kill them. If you don't kill them in time, you can't progress to the next stage. Every stage consists of ten monsters, and there is a boss every five stages, on multiples of five. By stage 100 and above, bosses have a chance to be "Primal", which is a special version of the boss that drops "hero souls". Every boss from stages in multiples of ten starting from stage 100 (100, 110, 120, etc) give a "gild" to a random hero from your list. At stage 100, you also unlock ancients.

Hero souls is a special "currency" that does two things. First, it increases your base DPS (what you have when you start the game) by 10% for each hero soul you have. It doesn't show in your DPS that is shown in your total current DPS shown in the hero tab, but it definitely affects it. Having hero souls is important to improve your damage and general progression, or else your DPS is too slow. However, they also serve as currency to unlock ancients.

Ancients are special "characters" that do various passive bonuses. There are a bit over 20 of them, and four are selected randomly for you to pick one from. It can be rerolled if you don't want them, but that costs hero souls. Anyway, ancients effects include increasing all your DPS by a certain amount but only when you are idle (i.e. not clicking or using skills for 60 seconds), increasing the amount of time you get to fight a boss, increasing click damage, getting a LOT more gold from random treasure chests, etc. Ancients are absolutely key to progressing in the game, so you need to find a good balance between keeping enough hero souls on yourself to keep a good DPS bonus, while still improving your ancients that will benefit you more than the hero souls' DPS you lose for improving said ancients. It can get very technical on a mathematical level.

Gilds are a type of bonus awarded to your heroes. They're assigned to a random hero when you get them from defeating a boss that is a  multiple of 10 starting from stage 100, but it is later possible to move them to other heroes for a cost (in hero souls). A gild improves that hero's damage by 50%, and gilds are cumulative. For instance, having five gilds on a hero increases its damage by 250%. You definitely want those on heroes that gain a lot of "attack bonus" skills on themselves (such as Masked Samurai) rather than on heroes that have other effects that don't involve having a lot of DPS (such as Alexa which mostly improves click and critical damage, Midas which mostly improves gold drops, etc).

Finally, "Ascension" is the other important mechanic to explain. Once you get the skill "ASCENSION" from the hero named Amenhotep, you can learn the skill to do an ascension, which brings you down to the first stage and you lose all your money and your heroes lose all their skills. In exchange for "starting over", you gain a certain amount of hero souls based on a few things.

Hero souls gained from killing a Primal boss are only truly awarded after ascending. Also, each 2000 cumulative hero levels you had before ascension give an additional hero soul upon ascension. When you ascend, you keep your gilds and ancients. With the hero souls you gain, you are able to progress faster than the previous time, and you can get overall further and faster. A lot of the joy in the game is the way you get a little bit further than the last time you ascended, each time you get there.

There's a bit more to the game, but this is most of the important stuff that you need to know. Another thing of note which, to my knowledge, is not explained by the game, is that after level 200, a hero gains four times the amount of DPS as normal, every 25 levels, and most importantly, ten times that amount at level 1000 (and 2000 and 3000). It's important to note because once you get to a certain point and the next hero (Dread Knight) is just faaaaaar too expensive, you want to go back to your first hero and level him up to 1000 which becomes the new best thing, rather than keep increasing the last available hero (Frostleaf) who gains rather minimal DPS. You'll need to ascend many many times before you can even dream of getting Dread Knight, so get those early heroes to level 1000 which is the new meta at that point.

Since a lot of the progression is done through DPS, which is automatic, it's an easy game to play which you can leave running in the background while you do other things and that you can check on once in a while. One thing of note is that when the game is closed, your heroes still are gaining gold from monsters they kill. It's like the game keeps playing itself even when it's closed, although they won't progress to the next level/set of enemies or go past bosses and such. Only gold from monsters of the current highest stage you're at is considered. Since this is such a relaxing game to play, which you don't need to pay a whole lot of attention to most of the time, I recommend it to whoever isn't afraid of doing some maths to maximize their experience with the game. Or following a guide, I suppose. :p

Finally, it is a very known fact that you can use "autoclicker" programs with this game. I personally don't because it's not something I feel is natural to the game's intent and purposes, but it's something you can do, which a lot of people do. When playing without, most of the damage come from DPS and you don't need to click and/or can click only for important stuff such as bosses when you need the extra damage (and/or when using all your skills together for burst damage). Of course having such a program running nonstop will be a large part of your damage compared to someone playing without, especially with relevant ancients that complement that, so keep that in mind.
This is one of the best clicker type games out there imp. 
First of all, CH is very balanced in all stages of the game(early mid and late) and never gets stale because of the trancention-mechanic.
Secondly, Rubies can be bought with real money, but are actually pretty easy to obtain, which shows that the devs did not want this game to be a buy-to-win. I do however encourage you to buy some anyways to support them.
Third of all, they keep adding new stuff pretty often like the autoclicker and autoclicker ancient that came some weeks later.
And let us not forget that clicker heroes is free even though they have spent a lot of time and money making this game.
The original, the best, the only worthwhile clicker game.

You think it's a game, but this really pokes fun at gaming with tongue-in-cheek text.  It exposes all the math underneath the game.  Do you understand the difference between arithmetic, geometric, and exponential progression?  That will help you more than anything for this game.  Progression requires exponential power, but it's given to you at a lesser level.  That means that eventually you hit a wall and have to "ascend".  This starts the game over, but parts of your progress you retain for the next "life".

A recent patch added an additional level of "starting over" called Transcension.  This wipes out an additional level of stuff but allows you to progress further and faster next time.  So you are replaying the same game hundreds of times... I'm on life (ascension) #888, transcension #13.  Most of those ascensions are from before that patch, hence the over 5000 hours of gameplay.

You can click (no aiming necessary) and progress, but the game supports an idle style as well.  Clicking will eventually win out, but you can wait a day or two before you start that part.  Autoclickers are now part of the gameplay, as long as you are willing to "pay" for it.  You can pay for rubies as an in-game currency, but a purchase is not necessary.  The game also awards you rubies for clicking on certain items, and I swear it gives me more when I'm not looking.  These can be used to purchase in-game auto-clickers (as opposed to external programs that send clicks to the window).  I paid for a couple of things because I wanted to support the devs.

Other than the numbers, there's no real reward.  No story line.  Just higher and higher exponents, like now I've sacrificed 7.597 x 10^30  hero souls.  What other game makes you read floating point notation (like 7.597e30) to understand the game?  

And what the heck is Transcendent Power?  I'd have to explain the whole game to get to that point, but then this would not be a review.  Read up on the Clicker Heroes subreddit, start yourself out slowly.  You'll be bewildered for a while, but slowly you'll come around.

Pros:
* The dev team is very active and is still updating gameplay with new ideas and improvements.
* Active player community with dev invovlement on reddit (/r/ClickerHeroes).
* Number watching is somehow thrilling.  Is my nerd showing?
* Game well-balanced and thought out.

Cons (all very minor):
* Relics are largely useless, except where they boost your Atman level.  Even then not so much.
* Mercenaries die far too randomly, IMHO.  Revival can cost astronomical and economically unfeasible amounts of rubies.
* The wandering click-on animal to activate a random skill is also largely useless.
* Does anyone actually send their mercenaries out on skill activation quests?
* The first ascension is painfully slow and requires a lot of handholding.  Requires "tricks" of play to reduce this problem, but it is not fully eliminated.
* Raids don't give a lot of hero souls, but perhaps because I'm the only one in the guild.
* Relic levelling is awkward to accomplish and unreasonably expensive after the first few levels.  A high-level relic costs the same 1 core to increase by one level as a low-level one, but this always increases quadratically per added level (not the existing level of the relic).
I was addicted to this game while I was playing. I spent so much time in this game trying to get achievements...until I decided to stop playing clicker/idle games because it was taking up so much of my time. I think out of all the clicker games I played, Clicker Heroes was my most played.
I've officially lost my mind

This game has robbed me of my life. It's honestly embarrassing how many hours I've poured into this game

Well at least it's not pay to win
I broke my mouse because im going rampage clicking, this game is just ordinary clicking game with no unique features, but it has addictive element. I heard there will be clicker heroes 2 too. 

= 7/10!
Clicker Heroes is a a drug that requires increasing doses. Try it only if you have a strong willpower. Clicker Heroes is one of THOSE games. Like, THOSE games. When you look at it, it seems like a ridiculously simple idea, like a little kid invented it or something. You're like, "Wow that looks dumb." and move on. However, if you decide to be so open-minded as to actually play the game before judging it, suddenly your a** will be glued to your chair, you just can't stop playing. Seems familiar? Can relate? This is the exact thing that happened to me (don't worry, I still have a social life and don't have to move around with a computer chair stuck to my rear end). So anyway, if you are looking for a way to kill time if you're feeling really bored, then Clicker Heroes is the way to go for sure. 

One more thing: Prepare for your fingers to have the time of their lives. 10/10, got balls? Try it!
I love clicker heroes. It's basically a time waster and also really fun. But sometimes I wonder...
"Why am I still clicking" and "Instead of playing outside and getting sun I'm inside wasting my life."
And that's exactly how I want it
*clicking noise intensifies*
Me: Just five more levels
Also me: But if I do ten more I'll be glad I did tomorrow...
*Second mouse starts giving out*

We don't talk about clicker heroes, we just click, click until the day we die.
I broke free, I don't intent to ever go back...
10/10 game, must play
I enjoy the game as a pass time when I have nothing better to do, or not enough time to do anything else. I'd recommend it as one of the better free games on steam. Overall probably around a 7/10 mostly because of mercenary death.
It is what it is. At times, it's a fun clicker game that's taken me years to get to ~79% complete on achievements. I did an estimation on how much time it will take to get 100%, and it comes out to about Spring 2119. 5/10.
I give this game an Autism/10 for the mind-numbing repetitiveness of this type of game.
However, I must say, compared to other clicker games this one is probably my favourite.
It's an addiction. I am not joking. You don't want to be addicted to this. There are expansive fantasy worlds to explore, intriguing mysteries, puzzles to solve, and stories to be told. And here I am, instead of any of those other games that actually have that, I'm just... clicking a monster.

This is half-joking, but also containing my honest opinion. I just don't like what these type of games make you do. Get addicted to some other game. Thank you for reading this humble little review.

Back then, most clicker games had a better idea when to stop, like Candy Box, A Dark Room, & Space Lich Omega. They all have a good story, there is actual exploration, ASCII art, and they don't break your mouse.
I don't even know I spent all this time on this sinkhole. Probably AFK with an auto-clicker.

Nope.

Dodge the bullet.

Save yourselves and spend your time in a better way, not like I did.

I cannot recommend this title, and here's why:

There's mainly 2 ways to play the game, actively or passively. Pursuing the game actively highly involves clicking the enemy target for as long as your fingers, toes, and other creative means allow you to go on. Do take note, that even if you decided on taking the active route because it may seem like you'll progress faster in the short future, in the long run, the difference isn't as huge as one might think.  

Passive gameplay involves opening the game, leaving a few tweaks on upgrades and then closing the game again. The main aspect of this gameplay is what it does while the game is shut down, as it also fights passively for you once you get your very first few upgrades. 

For both gameplay types there's a later game strategy, as you decide between which skills you use and which special supportive powers called Ancients you invest in (by spending hero souls, the currency of the game). These can highly change the speed of your progression throughout the game. However, sooner or later you'll hit a wall where your damage is simply no longer enough for progressing with your current upgrades. This will force you to start the game countless times back at stage 1 in order to earn more hero souls for upgrades. So, you'll have to gear yourself with remarkable amounts of patience (if you can call it that) if you plan on getting anywhere in this game, as it won't change an inch beyond selecting upgrades.

My main objective when I started the game was to get its achievements, which I at first thought would've been a breeze considering the lack of any requirements beyond clicking. It's even capable of idling and playing itself while you're gone. How hard can it be? The plan was to only spend small amounts of time on the game, which didn't happen, as the game also rewards you for actively playing. Hoping to rush through the game quicker for the achievements, I continued. 

[i]The trap in all of this is for people who wish to 100% it, for this is no easy task due to it being the same thing for something which feels and looks like... an eternity.[/i]

Would I recommend people to play this game? No, I really can't say that there's anything to come here for, other than a quick fix of satisfaction for a few minutes for the active player, just to realise later that you'll be that bit more disappointed that you even spent your time on it in the first place. And as a passive player, you're in for a long wait consisting of tiny upgrading and no variation.

Through all this, I've learnt that clicker games don't work for me, even though I had thought they might've at first! At least not when it's executed in the way that Clicker Heroes had. Perhaps I would've been better prepared for it in the beginning had it been called Passive Heroes. And maybe by removing the clicking feature alltogether, and making it a passive waiting game would've made the experience very different.

tldr;
It gets tedius very, very fast and you should probably be spending your gaming time elsewhere. I wouldn't want to recommend such an experience to anyone. It feels like a human experiment. The princess is in another castle~ 

Overall, if you insist and MUST play it, I would recommend the passive route a lot more and think of the game as passive heroes instead of clicker heroes, as the reward vs investment in active gameplay is just not there.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T PLAY THIS!  It gets addictive really fast. You will start out innocently enough, but it quickly becomes an obsession. All you can think about. You play and play, until one day you realize you will never really get anywhere and you are wasting your life on this stupid clicker game, and you have tons of other games with story and depth to play. So you delete the game and never look back. 

Clicker games, not even once.
I'm embarrassed to have so many hours on this game.

I'd leave it on at work, come home on breaks (lived within walking distance), would furiously click for a few intense moments while I'd fail to ignore the voice in the back of my head saying, "What are you doing? What is the point of any of this?" Because I would say to that voice, every time I got done clickclickclick*(1,233e14)ing, "It was worth it. I got to see higher numbers today."

And then I would return to my menial retail job, smiling at everyone, greeting customers every day who'd spend in an hour at my store more than I made in a week, and I'd keep telling that same voice, "Yes, this is worth it, too. Keep at it. You need to do this (for the benefits!!!)."

But I didn't. I didn't need that job, and I didn't need Clicker Heroes . . . and neither do you. Stay away and keep your dignity.
"Ever wondered what one quadrillion damage per second feels like?" the store page asks. Spoilers: it feels a lot like one million damage. And a lot like one thousand damage did a handful of levels before that. Everything scales so smoothly and so high that it frankly stops having any impact at all. It's just numbers going up to make other numbers go down. I have never seen a game that gave me less of a sense of just how big a billion is. I can't put it down. If I can get my damage to go from 15,544s to around 300S, I can tackle the next boss. I've lost control of my life.

10/10 defense budget simulator, 10/10 gamer hindbrain stimulant, 0/10 good idea.
I was totally addicted. I played like all day, every day. I don't know how I did it, but I managed to always have it open and always switch tab back to it. It's one of those games. Alas, it is now dead to me. Isn't it lovely when you get a game to check your progress, and voila, you're back to step one? I mean, sure you can back up, and I should have- but come on, doesn't it save to a cloud? It was gone just like that, and it was a pretty stupid game striving to give you carpal tunnel in the first place... It may seem enjoyable at first sight, or maybe not, but I suggest you use your time on another game. This was [i] not [/i] worth those 389 hours. I don't know how that much time on [i] this [/i] game happened, but I'm a bit depressed about it.
