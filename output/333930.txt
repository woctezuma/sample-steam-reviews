[b]Unfortunately, further development and updates to Dirty Bomb have permanently stopped. On the bright side, Splash Damage has still kept some servers up for anyone still wanting to play.[/b]

Here is my original review written back in 2017.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

[h1][b]Time to play Dirty![/b][/h1] 

[b]Dirty Bomb[/b] has been a game I only played recently this year which I enjoyed a lot. It is an FPS where movement is key and aiming down sights is not very beneficial in many firefights. It may not be the best F2P game out there, but it fills a niche for old style FPS games with a blend of modern FPS mechanics.

[h1][b][u]Is it Pay-2-Win?[/u][/b][/h1]
No. You start out with two mercs [u]Skyhammer[/u] (Fire Support who can provide ammo) and [u]Aura[/u] (Medic) which I consider to be very versatile. After reaching level 3, you will be given 30,000 credits to purchase a merc (please don't instantly buy Vasilli). There are currently 21 mercs in total and the majority of the mercs will cost $5-10 with real money if you want them right away. However, it is possible to unlock the mercs with ingame credits and their pricing will range from 30k to 50k. 

DB has a mission system where every 3 hours you are given 3 missions, which can reward you from 500-1000 credits each. Most of them boil down to "Earn X amount of XP in a certain mode" or "Earn X amount of Combat XP". 

Because you can only bring 3 mercs in a game, chances are you are not going to buy every single merc. You will most likely buy 3-5 mercs you enjoy and alternate between each. The game also has a free rotation of 2-3 mercs every other week to let you try out certain mercs.  Engineer mercs are considered a requirement and will always go on free rotation.

[h1][b][u]About Loadout cards[/u][/b][/h1]
These are cards that determine what weapons and augments (like character upgrades that give you small boosts) you will have. The loadout cards that provide augments can all be bought with in game credits in the store. In addition, after a game, you may get a case drop which will give you a random loadout card for any merc. Hierarchy of cards by rarity are: 
[b]Bronze -> Silver -> Gold -> Cobalt -> Obsidian[/b]
[u][b]Bronze cards[/b][/u] can be purchased in the ingame store for real money or credits. These are the best cards that affect gameplay.
[u][b]Silver cards[/b][/u] and above are exactly the same as Bronze only with cosmetic changes.

[h1][b][u]Gameplay[/u][/b][/h1]
Dirty Bomb currently has 2 game modes:
- [b]Objective[/b] (Complete a set of objectives. If you complete all you win. If time runs out, you lose)
- [b]Stopwatch[/b] (Basically Objective mode but you switch sides. Which ever team finishes the objectives the fastest wins)

Many maps have you plant C4 on an objective, stealing/delivering cores, or escorting a vehicle. Maps have "secondary objectives" that allow you to take alternate routes or restrict an enemy team from taking a certain path such as repairing/destroying generators and constructing bridges.

[h1][b][u]Gunplay[/u][/b][/h1]
The time to kill is not very fast most of the time (encounters can last 2-4 seconds during most of my playtime) and as a result, the game becomes more of how good your aiming and tracking is. Instead of a fancy parkour system like Brink had, we get a easy to use "wall jump" that can be used to traverse different or higher areas of maps.

Personally, I love the gameplay as it encourages always being on the move and shooting. Yes, guns have movement inaccuracy, but it is much more beneficial to be strafing constantly than standing still to shoot. You can aim down sights which also gives you a "zoom" to see farther enemies clearer, but in close combat it's not really worth it. Even if you aren't an assault class, as a medic or engineer, you are still combat effective (just not at long ranges). In addition, every merc can do an objective and any merc can revive fallen teammates, but certain mercs can do the actions faster.

[h1][b][u]Some quick tips for new players[/u][/b][/h1]
‚óè [b][u]Give ammo [/u][/b]
If you are a fire support and you see an ammo icon above teammates' heads, it means they are running low. yes there are ammo crates in the maps but those take a while to resupply ammo.
‚óè[b][u]As a medic, charge down the defibs[/u][/b] to revive teammates for more HP. Simply taping people with defibs only gives them a small amount of health.
‚óè[b][u]Stop repair stacking objectives[/u][/b]
Meaning trying to have more than one person working on an objective. If you see "Faster Teammate Repairing" or you already see someone planting C4 (The game doesn't really explain this to players), it means an engineer or someone else is already working on an objective so cover them.
‚óè[b][u]Please don't immediately play ranked as soon as you are level 7[/u][/b]
[spoiler](I'll admit, I made this mistake)[/spoiler]

[h1][b][u]Should you try it?[/u][/b][/h1]
Dirty Bomb does not really have a large audience and to be fair it is a rather niche FPS title. You may get stomped by a ton of veterans and given how it is a F2P game, it happens. If you ever wanted a "better version of Brink" or simply just a different FPS game from all of the military style games, I'd say give it a shot. I would encourage you to try to play more than 5-10 hours as early impressions of the game may not be great for everyone.
Making this review for those concerned by Angry Joe's misinformed remark that [i]Dirty Bomb[/i] is pay-to-win: [b]it is NOT[/b].

1. [i]Angry Joe's Argument #1[/i]: You need a get a high-end loadout card to do good.
[i]Counterpoint[/i]: The cards you get aren't game breaking at all. They simply offer sidegrades to the default weapons. I've never lost a gunfight because the other person had a better card than my lead (lowest grade) Skyhammer card!

2. [i]Angry Joe's Argument #2[/i]: To get the best cards, you need to spend $55.
[i]Counterpoint[/i]: I'm just gonna quote [b]TotalBiscuit[/b]'s counterargument: "You can buy any loadout [card] in the game for ingame credits no problem." Not to mention Angry Joe's friend who was present during the video told him not to spend the $55. It was entirely unnecessary. The game never pressures you to spend a dime. The only way I'd feel pressured to spend real money is if they put in a skin that gives the overly masculine Skyhammer a super cute pink ballerina outfit (please!). 

3. [i]Angry Joe's Argument #3[/i]: To get the best cards, if you don't want to spend $55, you have to grind for hours to get enough to buy the card.
[i]Counterpoint[/i]: Again, quoting TotalBiscuit: "Grind? You play the game, thats the point of games right, to play them? Progression is something that happens as you play, its not the goal, the goal is to win."

4. [i]Angry Joe's Argument #4[/i]: The card system is based on RNG and it's a terrible system.
[i]Counterpoint[/i]: So basically the card system is that you get cards from cases (that you get from winning games or using 2 games worth of in game currency to buy -- and no, they don't require $2.49 to open like CS:GO cases! <3) that determines your mercenaries' weapons, camo outfit, and perks. The card you get is completely random, and the weapons are usually just preference since they're all on par with the default weapons. Angry Joe's anger stemmed from the fact that he opened a ton of these cases and got, in his mind, horrible cards. I personally think it's a great thing that someone can put $55 into this game and NOT get the most perfect card ever (even though there isn't "best" card for any merc).

I hope I could clear things up for you Angry Joe fans who are looking to get into Dirty Bomb.
Starting off I really wasnt a big fan of this game. It had a lot of elements which frustrated me to no end. But after perseveering for a little longer, the game really started to grow on me, now I love it.

Dont expect to have fun immediately, but once you start to get a bit more experience and learn the ropes its a really great game.
Most fun I've had with an FPS in a long time. Pretty fast-paced combat, classes aren't too gimmicky. Anyone who digs Enemy Territory or thought Brink had a ton of potential should definitely check it out

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ñ£¬†Dirty Bomb is a great fast paced FPS game which is objective driven, It has tons of different classes (mercenaries) to play to fit your playstyle whether it be Medic, Assault, Recon, Fire Support and Engineer with each of them varying from health pool, movement speed, abilities and weapons. There are currently 20 playable mercenaries and they are divided into 5 

1.) ùêåùêÑùêÉùêàùêÇ = Can revive people instantly using their defibs wherein other classes can pick up downed teammates for 10 seconds.

2.) ùêÑùêçùêÜùêàùêçùêÑùêÑùêë = Can Plant, Repair and Defuse objectives two times faster than non-engineer classes

3.) ùêëùêÑùêÇùêéùêç = Can reveal the enemies position by using their abilities.

4.) ùêÄùêíùêíùêÄùêîùêãùêì = Can help you push the objective with their High damage and Health pool.

5.) ùêÖùêàùêëùêÑ ùêíùêîùêèùêèùêéùêëùêì = Can provide you ammo and Area damage using their abilities.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ñ£¬†Dirty Bomb has a high skill ceiling wherein you can't just win by using your abilities because you can outgun the abilities of the mercenaries if done correctly, gunplay still takes skill even if the recoil is small considering that the game has a very fast paced movement system with its wall and long jumps for you to access different places you wouldn‚Äôt access with merely just walking. With this you can access flank routes that can help you achieve the objective easily.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ñ£¬†It's not pay to win at all, since for what I understand is that "pay to win" is spending money which gives you an advantage to the F2P players (ex. Spending money gives you +20% damage compared to F2P players, Getting overpowered items that the F2P can't get). 

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ñ£¬†The things you could do with real money in this game is to buy credit booster, crafting kits, exclusive trinkets (Trinkets are nothing but decoration to your primary weapon) and Expert & Elite Cases these are cases that gives you higher chances of getting higher tier cards than a normal case. But this doesn‚Äôt mean that you couldn't get them in a normal case (In fact I got like 5 Cobalt‚Äôs in normal cases). You could also buy mercenaries to easily unlock them all but they could all be unlocked by just playing the game and earning in-game credits. This also adds the feel of progression in the game by slowly unlocking every mercenary and learning their different play styles.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ñ£¬†I've heard this a lot from new players and all I can say that this is not true, All loadout cards above bronze (Silver, Gold and Cobalt) is just purely cosmetic.

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ñ£¬†I won't say it doesn‚Äôt have the grinding aspect since mercenary‚Äôs costs 30,000C or 50,000C each and you get credits by playing each game and the amount of credits you get depends on your performance the reward varies around 100C-250C if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
 
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ñ£¬†But it's not that massive of a grind since there are these 3 different missions that gives you rewards ranging from 500C, 750C and 1000C and it refreshes every 3 hours. There are these daily bonuses too that gives you around 2,000C in total (ex. Winning your first objective game gives you 1000 credits)

¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†‚ñ£¬†If you are a fan of Unreal Tournament, Quake, Brink, Team Fortress 2 and other fast paced games. I would highly recommend that you should download and try Dirty Bomb out since its free and all. If Dirty Bomb was a 60$ game I would totally buy it because it‚Äôs just that good. So hop into the game and always remember to play DIRTTTTTTYYYYYYYY.

Dirty Bomb has been my game of choice since open beta (July 2015). During that time I have seen people come and go in the game. But I have stayed for one reason - its just a great game! its fast paced, dynamic, fun, enjoyable, and no matter how long ive played it (I am level 127, with thousands of hours) there is always something new to learn and master.

Historically its had some bad things happen, mainly hackers, but I blame Nexon for been bastards - SplashDamage the owners of Dirty Bomb wanted a big publisher to promote their game so they signed a contract with Nexon thinking it would help them.. it did not.. if anything Nexon held them back! big time. Since departing their contract, SplashDamage has implemented Easy Anti Cheat and I havn't seen a hacker since.

If you are umming and arrring about playing Dirty Bomb.. stop... its FREE.. just give it a go... 

FYI: My favourite character hands down has got to be Fletcher
Just reached level 50. 910 hours in game. 

Where to start...
I have a love-hate relationship with Dirty Bomb. The Gameplay mechanics and game itself is brilliant. The dev team.. not so brilliant. 

The game: 
Dirty Bomb is the best of both worlds in a single game; fast paced, action packed combat, good map design, good movement and physics, graphics are pretty. Gameplay is intense and gets me competitive. Overall the game is a gem, just being covered in dirt as I will later discuss. 

The Devs: 
For the most part, the devs of Dirty Bomb cherish the game and try to do what they think is best. The only problem is that seldom do they actually seek community feedback prior to applying changes to the game. Recently a new crafting system has been implemented without even notifying the community. Everyone was enraged. Many quit and boycott the game. The devs were trying to be more engaging with the community ironically enough, and I give them kudos for trying but... you can't fuck the game and expect people to not bat an eye. 

Crafting: 
As a veteran, of course I hate it. We all do. Not that Splash Damage thought to even acknowledge us. The old trade up system worked a charm -- You collected different loudouts from cases, traded them up for a higher rarity, traded up several higher rarity to get Cobalt. The trade up system offered a great deal of progress, which gave incentive for players, veterans in particular, to continue playing and supporting the game that we dearly loved. The new crafting system could be good, but the overpriced, uneccessary, and illogical components get to me. Not only is crafting more expensive (you have to buy crafting kits in order to craft anything, or pay 50,000 credits which is the same as a single fucking merc.), It wil probably take 5000 hours of grinding to get enough weapon kits to craft a Colbalt. Not to mention all our cards that aren't Cobalt are fucking worthless now. 

The Community: 
Dirty Bomb has a good community, in that players want to support and enjoy competing with one another. Hackers are everywhere. There isn't a good anti-hack system, and for the most part hackers just create a new account. People in clans often dominate games, or due to the awful balancing system 80% of games are one sided and crap. Now and then you'll get a good one, or have to keep leaving games until you land a decent shuffle. The game has no balancing system for levels (yet). 

Verdict: 
I used to have such a fondness for this game. Now it is withering. I still like Dirty Bomb, this is no hate rant. I am just sad to see a game with so much potential to do so well being trashed by its devs. (Don't) keep it up. I haven't lost all faith, but if the next update is like the crafting one I am done. So are a lot of others. Please, Splash Damage - treat your game with some respect, and the community who keep it alive at that. 

The first 100 hours are fun, the next 2000 you will spend complaining about shotguns, double mercing and explosive spam. But overall DB is still the best free to play FPS out there.And if the Devs  manage to get out of Beta (SoonTM) it has great potential.

Pro Tips: thank your medic once in a while and drop ammo - gg ez
FINALLY Splash Damage ironed out Brink and this is the awesome result.

FINALLY Nexon doesn't fuck up a game it publishes. (Edit: Nexon doesn't publish DB anymore, the developers do.)

FINALLY a free-to-play with no pay-to-win elements.

FINALLY a decent anti-cheat system.

FINALLY good mechanics, models and animations and overall gameplay.

And this game goes completely under the radar. It breaks my heart.
Pros:
Great shooting mechanics
Even better movement mechanics
Fantastic and Amusing diversity of characters
Unique and strategic impementation of loadouts.
Wonderful and social development team
No pointless durability mechanics
No pay to win mechanics

Cons:
Needs consistent and compelling monetization to speed up developement.
Rare bling is truly and very much so. Almost discouraging.
Needs proper instructions for new players & deeper practice options.
IMPORTANT:  ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT HAS CEASED AS OF 2018, OCTOBER.  SERVERS WILL REMAIN UP UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, BUT CONSIDER THIS GAME DEAD.

Once upon a time, I got my FPS kicks primarily through arena FPS games like Unreal Tournament. Then Unreal kinda stopped being a thing, and I moved over to Call of Duty and Battlefield. What was a FPS-starved gamer to do? And you know, I had fun and everything, but those games kinda made me complacent; even a little bit bad. But along came Dirty Bomb, and like a proper, classy lady, Dirty Bomb promptly proceeded to kick my teeth in. In the good way, of course. The best way. A beautiful return to form, with longer time to kills and purist FPS mechanics. You don‚Äôt realize how much you miss something until it‚Äôs been taken away from you for years, and then you get it back. I didn‚Äôt know it, but I actually needed Dirty Bomb.

So, what is Dirty Bomb? Dirty Bomb is Splash Damage‚Äôs latest team-based, breakneck, run and gun shooter where small teams race to complete objectives via policy of liberally applied violence. Dirty Bomb offers old school gameplay emphasizing mastery of movement and mechanical skill, placing a rare premium on tracking and headshots, skillsets no longer required in today‚Äôs glut of instant kill FPS games. These elements are given a modern coat of paint, with real world analogs like M4 carbines in place of link rifles.

Matches occur on large, multi-tiered maps with multiple, sequential objectives. Brink-esque, light parkour elements offer additional mobility options for clever players to get into tricky spots or to eek out momentary advantages over their foes. So far, so Splash Damage. While the execution game mode takes many cues from Counterstrike, Dirty Bomb‚Äôs Brink-style game modes, objective and stopwatch, is where the game shines.

Players select from a large roster of distinctive mercenaries, each catering to different play styles, fulfilling different but complementary roles. Medics heal and revive. Support rifleman provide ammo and call in artillery. Engineers complete objectives faster and often use alternatives to direct combat. Mercs are further divided into light, medium and heavy categories, with light mercs being faster but less durable than their heavier counterparts. Players pick three of these mercs, ‚Äúcustomized‚Äù via loadout card with up to three augments, for use in a match.

In reply to Angry Joe's garbage "review," while loadouts with more augments are more powerful than loadouts with fewer augments, these augments will rarely determine the outcome of individual firefights. Additionally, players can purchase any three-augment loadout they want in bronze quality cheaply with ingame currency, and higher quality loadouts ( silver, gold, cobalt ) are purely cosmetic. Dirty Bomb is NOT pay to win.

While good ability usage can determine matches, all abilities are linked to sometimes long cooldown timers, and players will end up relying on their firearms. A lot. As mentioned, due to longer time to kills, single burst kills are rare and combat prowess becomes of utmost importance. Hipfire reigns, and with a healthy 2.0x headshot damage multiplier, Dirty Bomb emphasizes a duelist approach to combat with players strafing and juking while attempting to lay down the hurt. Without vehicles and killstreaks getting in the way, combined with excellent netcode, combat is returned to glorious infantry, el mano, el mano basics.

This represents Dirty Bomb‚Äôs greatest strength and greatest weakness. Due to Splash Damage shirking modern design principles designed to minimize skill gap, Dirty Bomb is not a game most players will be able to simply drop into and expect good results. Unlike other FPS games like Overwatch, handholding is kept to a minimum; it is down to the individual to put in the effort, and maybe some tears, to "git gud." However, with some investment, Dirty Bomb offers dedicated players huge room to grow through challenging matches, with thrilling engagements, in ways its streamlined competition cannot.

If this all sounds like paradise to you, well, it sorta is.  Sorta, cause Dirty Bomb definitely has its fair share of problems.

To start, the competitive scene is not healthy, and overall, Dirty Bomb likely doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to go mainstream. Part of the reason is that Dirty Bomb is difficult. Without proper matchmaking ensuring players get evenly matched, new and lesser skilled players are often subject to routine, demoralizing stomps.

The balance isn‚Äôt perfect; explosives, shotguns and sniper rifles are too effective, and while the various mercs are fairly well balanced, a handful do stand a bit taller. The same goes for augments; some augments are clearly better, making certain loadouts clearly better.

Moreover, Dirty Bomb runs on a fairly outdated engine; no manner of tweaking will result in a DOOM silky experience.

Outside of gameplay, the loadout system is... well, it‚Äôs not good and desperately requires overhaul. With skins randomly assigned to loadouts, even if a player is lucky enough to receive a great loadout card, they may not get the skin they want. Furthermore, with skins tied to loadouts, Splash Damage can‚Äôt sell skins either. This also leads to the odd situation where while unlocking a merc isn't particularly difficult ( about 19 - 26 hours ), getting the loadout you want in gold or cobalt may as well be impossible. Due to these issues and the inability to trade inventory items, the cash shop feels horribly overpriced. Oh, and trinkets, being mostly invisible to other player, kinda suck.

While this may seem like nitpicking, I believe this indicates a fundamental disconnect between Splash Damage and reality. A lot of this is very stupid, but fixable, yet hasn‚Äôt been fixed resulting in everybody being upset. As example, events are typically terrible, plagued by abusive monetization, with reward drop rates being so low they may as well be imaginary with the current event requiring perhaps 40 hours to obtain a single drop ( 1% drop rate, ~45 mins. per drop, halve for average ).

It's heartbreaking for a game with so much potential to be shackled with such poor marketing.

Last, but not least, is Dirty Bomb‚Äôs aesthetic. Not sure how this ended up last, but if you hadn‚Äôt noticed Dirty Bomb‚Äôs many similarities with it‚Äôs predecessor, Brink, the aesthetics are a dead giveaway. While Dirty Bomb‚Äôs vision of near-future London is also a bit doom and gloom, the mercs have gained new threads and quite a bit more swagger. You won't find Overwatch level waifus here, but I personally am quite content to fawn over Kira. Best of all, the mercs are hilariously chatty ( mount an emplaced machine gun, and your merc will yell, ‚Äúpew pew pew!‚Äù ) with diverse backstories and surprisingly competent voice work delivering comedic taunts. Certain individuals may be discouraged by the somewhat cartoony aesthetic, but personally, I celebrate almost any move away from generic, military realism.

To sum it all up, Dirty Bomb is a well-crafted blend of old school mechanics and modern sensibilities. Despite perhaps lacking innovation, Dirty Bomb represents a refined Brink experience. You can‚Äôt win all your fights, but Dirty Bomb does pretty good; if only everything else was as well honed as the gameplay. If you're not convinced yet, but want to test your mettle while trying something new ( and free ), I highly recommend Dirty Bomb as your next possible addiction.

Disclaimer: I've spent ~$150 on this game.
Since this is a [b]Free to Play[/b] game you are better off just trying it yourself instead of taking my opinion for a fact. Instead I'll focus this review on the things you might want to know, before you commit to spending any money, or several hours of your life on Dirty Bomb.
[list]
    [*]The business model is very fair. You get both a daily play bonus as well as 'missions', which task you to play a certain class to earn extra credits. Furthermore there is no stupid 'renting' here, the stuff you unlock is yours.
    [*]There is a sort of 'Loot Box' system to the way you earn loadouts, however if you specifically want a certain one, you can also buy it directly with the in-game credits.
    [*]The playerbase is not huge but you'll never have problems finding a full server to play on. Ranked matches are done through matchmaking however, which can take a while. (Queue times obviously get significantly longer, the higher your ranking becomes)  
    [*]This is an 'easy to understand but hard to master' type of game. Hard means fucking hard though. I've seen more than enough schmucks with thousands of Counter Strike hours getting ground up into a fine paste and crying about it in chat. Having good FPS fundamentals will definitely help, but you will still get your teeth pushed in by more experienced players regularly. Thus if you are easily discouraged, you will probably never get far enough, to truly enjoy this game.
[/list]
Overall I would highly recommend Dirty Bomb, if you like fast class-based FPS.The only big downsides are that the ongoing development of new features is very slow, and that it will definitely take a significant while, until you are somewhat decent at it.
Lets dismiss the rumor that this game is Pay 2 Win, it actually isn't anywhere close to it. If you were to personally ask me what P2W is, I'd say, "Games with weapons or unlockables (Generally ones that give you an advantage or are just overpowered) not obtainable through playing the game for free, instead using real world money to unlock it."

TL;DR: Everything above Bronze in loadouts is cosmetic. Characters rotate to play for free every week.

How this game works is entirely different, you get loadout cards, now while you might think, "Oh, well that must mean that everything Silver and Gold is better than things that are Bronze." This is not correct, every card above Bronze simply works as a form of cosmetic.
On the other hand you have people that would say, "Getting a Bronze card would mean you have way too many advantages over players that don't." This is also not true, as the bronze cards simply give you perks on the side that give you small boosts, no gun damage, health (Except for one perk that gives you up to 30 health for dying multiple times) or other character attributes altered with cards.

Now with these loadout cards, you also get different weapons. These weapons on the loadout cards will change how you play your character. By default you have good loadouts, you can destroy anybody with the basic loadouts so long as you can aim, your guns make you, not your perks. You can get a different gun for every rarity of loadout, even the worst rarities come with guns that can change how you play by alot, but for the most part all the guns are reletively balanced.

Next comes the whole RNG thing that people get very angry at because they can't find good things in cases. 1000 ingame credits = 1 case, this case grants you 1 random loadout card in the game, with the higher tier rarities being lower chances of obtaining, but still possible. if you really want to go all out, you can spend 5 dollars in real world money for some random cases that are primarily used for the higher chance at getting Gold and Cobalt loadouts, but still guarenteed a Silver loadout.

The crafting system is next and it's pretty simple, put in cards you don't like of the same rarity and get the next loadout rarity up, you also select any of the characters that you want a loadout specifically for. Essentially trade up contracts in CS:GO. Pretty easy to understand, gives you another chance at randomizing and it's a way of letting you get loadouts that are Silver and higher without the RNG chance, however the weapons and perks are randomized each time. 
With that being said, if you find that you can't be bothered to open up cases for 1000 ingame credits, you can simply save up enough to just buy a bronze loadout that you like.

Next comes characters. Here's where people have whined most about the game. "6-10 Dollars for a single character in this game? What a ripoff!" And here's where I come in and say "You don't need to spend money, blah blah blah, you can play the game normally and get every character you just need to save up a bit."
On top of this, there is a free character rotation every week. Just like in League of Legends, every week three characters become unlocked for the week's duration as playable characters, afterwards you need to purchase them to keep them permanently.

To end this I'm simply going to put it. The game is fun, not Pay 2 Win, and it's starting to take up time I would spend playing Tf2.
Never had so much fun in a game
Never had so much fun sniping in a game
Never had so much fun in a free to play game
Never had so much fun playing the objective in a game
Never had so much fun grinding for mercs in a game
Never had so much fun grinding for merc cards in a game
Never had so much fun being called a hacker because of my skills in a game
Never had so much fun with the movement system in a game


Never loved a game this much.

10/10 Best game ever.
Best F2P FPS on Steam. Fun and fast paced, basically a Call of Strikefortress with some parkour elements.
Lots of playable merc characters, multiple types like medic, fire support, objective specialist etc.

And finally, not P2W - you can easily obtain any loadout or merc after some playing.
2 mercs are available for everyone and plus 3 free ones that will change every 2 weeks. 

Hugely underrated multiplayer FPS from the developers of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory and Quake Wars: Enemy Territory. A worthy successor to both. Don't let the fact that it's F2P turn you away from it.
Splash Damage takes a little bit of Wolf: ET and Brink and brings them into a new class based shooter.

If you enjoyed Brink despite it's flaws, you will enjoy Dirty Bomb since it largely improves on what Brink tried to achieve. A fast-paced shooter with a wide variety of classes makes the objective based game modes fun to play.

While it may not have the neat parkour of Brink or the double jumping Nazis of Wolf: ET it finds a balance between both to bring fast and fluid movement to the game.

I have enjoyed playing it during the closed beta before it was on Steam and I look forward to it opening up so the game will be more populated, but I am little leery about the future of the game due to it being published by Nexon.

If you want a fast and teamwork oriented shooter I would recommend this game.
It is really interesting to see the developer studio change over years, especially if its influenced by different publishers.

Back in 2011, Splash Damage launched a game called Brink, which really stood out especially with its artstyle and few intersting unique mechanics, however the game had major fault, it was only focused on PvE, which itself was pretty badly done.

Then the Splash Damage realized its mistakes and started developing Dirty Bomb, which is truly an amazing game. It kinda had unfortunate release date and didnt get much recognition at first, only to get further hidden by Overwatch and other Hero shooter game releases. In 2015 Dirty Bomb was published by Nexon, and while it was fun, it didnt get many updates as Nexon tried to release them as slow as possible, for some reason. Recently, Splash Damage bought the publishing rights from the Nexon and now they run the game themselves, and they have already released few new characters and maps, now they are working on integrating skin systems with steam itself and further improvements to game.
----
Now about the game itself

Dirty Bomb is essentially a Hero shooter, however it is focused on actual aiming part and good FPS skills. Game is very fast, fluid and has a good sense of control in it. There is definitely good learning curve and you can feel the strong difference once you truly master each hero (stylized as "mercs" in game). Shooting feels good and each shot lands where it should, shooting is mostly soft and precise, there aren't any guns with crazy recoil and it takes few more shoots to kill people (you cant just kill people with one headshot, unless you are playing as sniper).

There is interesting "finish" system where whenever you kill a person you actually knock them down and as long as you dont "finish" them on ground, they can be revived by medics and other players. It also uses wave spawn system which lets you respawn each 25 seconds, so if you died 1 second before the 25 cooldown timer, you can respawn straight ahead. This cooldown is shared across whole team, so that they can spawn in waves and attack/defend effectively together. Maps are rather well made and you can bounce off walls and do a lot of acrobatic skills. Mastering the parkour will give you very good options to escape fast and flank enemies with ease, especially if you are using low hp fast characters.

Now onto the characters, each merc is different and has its own voice lines and unique abilities. They can be classified into 4 different types: Medics (they have healing gizmos and can do instant revives), Engineers (which have faster objective completion speed) , Munitions (that can supply team with munitions), and rest which pretty much damage/assassin/sniper types which have only one unique ability and no team support abilities. There are no ultimate skills, rather special extra weapons like grenades, lasers, healing gizmos and such. One thing i think is important to mention is that there are no annoying shields like in Overwatch or Paladins, which really break down the game into tank fights, although they can be somewhat improvised with medic that drops healing station (still rather easy to disable) and few tankish characters. A bit of flaw in mercs them is that they cost a bit too much, after 300 hours i barely have half of them unlocked, although i did not spend my money wisely, and luckily there are 3 free ones in weekly rotations too.

Customization is really poor for now, it uses unique card system where all the weapons and passive skills for the character are preset on the cards you get from lootboxes (yes you can get them for free).  There is limited amount of weapons characters can get on cards based on their "class", so for example tanks cant get snipers, and snipers cant get shotguns etc. You choose one card for each merc you want to play and you can choose 3 different mercs to play with each match. The system isnt pay to win though, it is rather easy to get decent cards, but hard to get cards you want. Recently they have also added a skin system where you can get weapon skins which will soon be tradeable on steam. There are also small trinkets, but there is very limited amount of them

Dirty Bomb had a lot of different events with limited edition rewards from them. Rewards were rather nice, a lot of trinkets and cards to collect too, although they were always a bit too grindy.

Most of my personal flaws come from small map pool, only 3 (2) game modes, very laggy user interface and a too much useless waiting while switching between lobbies. The game also feels grindy. You also have to watch 20 second cutscene each time you switch sides / start match which tells you what to do, which can get annoying over time.  For some reason also, game gets boring very fast, and i really cant tell why anymore.
---

It is definitely a good game with unique artstyle and from this point on i think it will keep on getting better. I recommend every FPS fan to at least try it, its a good hybrid between First person shooters and Hero shooters, if you dont like Team Fortress, this is a game similar to it but for more hardcore FPS fans. This review is a big mess and i left few points overlooked since i rushed to write it, so if you want additional info, feel free to ask.

Pros:
- Active devs which care about the game and talk to community each week
- Game isnt pay to win
- Very soft, fast and enjoyable gunplay
- You can parkour and jump off walls, overall character control feels enjoyable and fast
- Unique artstyle
- Good choice and variation of interesting characters (around 20 characters)
- Very frequent events with limited edition rewards
- Interesting revive and wave respawn systems

Cons:
- Could use more maps and game modes
- Card system limits the customization and wont appeal to everyone
- It can be hard to get card you like since its RNG based
- Game feels grindy, characters take a lot of time to unlock
- Very glitchy and slow menu interface
- Game seems to be prone to crashing
- For some reason gets boring too fast
Let's talk about it this way about competetive games:

Dirty Bomb is like that kid who's great and friendly but nobody really talks about or plays with.Everyone's eyes are focused on the pretty young girl named Overwatch,and her slighty uglier sister, Paladins. Then there is the old and tough guy called Team Fortress 2, who everyone likes to share a beer with and talk with about the old times.

TF2 will stay a classic,though it might have been ruined in the last few years, I still play it from time to time, Overwatch is like any attractive girl, pretty aesthetically but pretty bland, straight forward and expensive. Dirty Bomb on the other hand, is a pure skill based shooter. The skill ceiling is high,the rewards for sticking with it and learning the game are plentiful. While Overwatch is based on hard counters, Dirty Bomb really isn't. Yes, some mercs are better against other mercs but overall the one with the better skill and aim will usually win, no matter which 2 mercs are fighting. In Overwatch,meanwhile, one hero will 9/10 times die when facing his hard counter.

Which is why this game isn't as popular as it should. It's a nicer looking take on the competetive games of my time, Quake III Arena, the original CS, Unreal Tournament and of course Wolfenstein:Enemy Territory(which is basically this game but updated). Overwatch is "with the time" where it's basically a casual game in competitive clothing, and also fan service, can't forget the fan service. Meanwhile Dirty Bomb takes no prisoners, it tells you right on the spot that you'll get your behind kicked over and over again until you get better than them. It doesn't have fancy bright maps or ladies in skin-tight outfits, it's set in London for crying out loud.

So if you've been born before 1999 you will most likely love this game, if you can't handle raw skill-based gameplay, there are always other "competetive" options for you.
Dirty Bomb has the [b]potential[/b] to be the best online FPS game in a a long time. It's fast paced, challenging, well themed and fun. 

+ Maps (although there are not a huge number of them) are well designed. 
+ Gunplay is focused on skill, landing headshots is a necessity no matter what weapon you are using. Spray and pray doesn't work, skill determines who walks out alive. 
+ Highly objecitve based.
+ Several mercs (classes) allow multiple playstyles and different team builds. 
+ Free to play and no pay to win elements. Spending your real money only helps with progressing faster, but doesn't give you any advantages over others. 

- Earning credits (used for buying mercs, loadouts etc.) is rather slow, so it takes quite a bit of grinding to get what you want.
- Team balance is a bit too often bad. You will have a fair share of unbalanced matches, but this isn't anything new to online games to be honest. 

Hence Dirty Bomb is a free game, I really see no reason why you wouldn't give it a go. After leaving TF2 (1000+ hours played) behind, Dirty Bomb has become the number one shooter game for me. This game will be a good experience for anyone who enjoy challenging and team based shooters. Hop onboard, and play dirty!
I highly recommend this game.
At it's heart is a fast-paced high-energy FPS which challenges your reflexes and urges you to learn the 'ins and outs' of its various characters.
It's chock full of humour, hijinx, violence, and puns.
The guns feel 'there', the movement of your player is 'immersive', and the sound & visuals are top-notch.
And if the personality of the Merc's don't get you, the intricacies of the gameplay will.

2 thumbs up.
Dirty Bomb is one of the best class based competetive team FPS games on the market, and it continues to get better with every update. Do yourself a favor and start playing.
I like to see this game as a mix between TF2 objectives and CS:GO gameplay and Battlefield-esque weaponry, with a more futuristic approach to it, featuring all the best aspects of those games.
Maps are fun to play and cleverly thought out, but not too complex. Weapons work exactly as you want them and all mercenaries fit different playstyles.
The graphics are very nice, with all things you would want to see implemented.
All in all: This game has a lot of potential.
The only free-to-play game I've played that barely has any P2W, the only P2W in this game would be buying crates that get you better cards that have perks, however after about 10 hours of playing you can buy a card for the character that you like for 17,500 credits, you get 3 missions every 3 hours that give you anywhere from 250 credits to 1000 credits which makes it really fast to get credits if you go on the game everyday or even twice a day.

[u]The cards work like this:[/u]

[b]Lead[/b] - 2 Guns/1 Melee, Different appearance, 1 Perk
[b]Iron[/b] - 2 Guns/1 Melee, Different appearance, 2 Perks
[b]Bronze[/b] - 2 Guns/1 Melee, Different appearance, 3 Perks
[b]Silver[/b] - 2 Guns/1 Melee, Different appearance, 3 Perks (from this point the cards are only appearance, as the perks don't get better)
[b]Gold[/b] - 2 Guns/1 Melee, Different appearance, 3 Perks
[b]Cobalt[/b] - 2 Guns/1 Melee, Different appearance, 3 Perks
Obsidian - 2 Guns/1 Melee, Different appearance, 3 Perks (Obsidian cards are limited edition and change the player model)

The gameplay is really good for a free to play and new players don't feel underpowered at all, I've never spent money on this and I find the game really easy and most of my cards are Iron.

I recommend trying it as the download isn't long as the game is fairly small to install, there also isn't really any other games that I could compare this to as it's quite a unique game, i'd give it a 8/10 simply because as a free-to-play game you can't really find many other's that compare to this one and the game feels quite fair to all players.

Edit: I forgot to say that you can also craft cards, so you will be able to craft any rarity card that you want, also once you reach Level 7 you can get special crates from leveling up which can give you a increased chance at getting Bronze and higher cards, there is also more that these crates give you such as being able to choose what weapon that you want on a crafted card, Another way of getting cards is just by simply playing, this gives you a crate for free every 4-5 matches that you play and these crates give you a chance at getting any rarity cards. thanks to the people that commented about these.
Back in 2003, Splash Damage released a standalone freeware game known as Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory.  It combined the speed and movement of Quake and the hitscan and aiming mechanics of Counter-Strike into a objective-based game.  The focus on team-oriented objectives created a very popular fps game that sadly had a community die off and move on.

Splash Damage attempted to revive the series with with Enemy Territory: Quake Wars, but was largely unsucessful.

Welcome to Dirty Bomb, the newest reincarnation of the gameplay.  It feels and plays like the first legitemate sucessor to Enemy Territory.  With similar team-based classes, and a much more noob-friendly interface than ET could ever muster, this game could possibly be the first game that is a legitemate competitor to CSGO in terms of competitive FPS games... as long as Nexon doesn't FUCK everything up and make the game p2w.

The shooting mechanics combine that of quake and counter-strike.  Players are tanky and can take 2 or 3 headshots to kill.  However, similar to CS, aiming for the head is highly rewarding as most guns will kill in 8 to 10 shots (generally it takes a little less than 2 seconds to kill a player with body shots).  Additionally, you're highly accurate while moving, which makes strafe shooting a viable and effective strategy.

Don't let the cartoonish atmosphere fool you, however.  Despite its simplistic nature, there is a lot of depth to the game in taking fights, healing with medics, and even intentionally suiciding to respawn with full ammo or to defend an objective.

If you like playing competitive FPS games, give this one a fair shot.  The gameplay is quite unforgiving for new players, but highly rewarding if you stick with it.
This is easily the best free to play game i had ever played. And one of the best games ever! ! ! !
I can¬¥t believe this awesome piece is free to play, this game is soooo much better than any other 60 USD fps shooter game. Run smoothly, well optimized, fun, almost no bugs, great netcode, love the way you unlock and buy new mercs, very happy with this game ! ! !
Highly recommended to try ! ! !
First off if you are worried about the game being P2W. Check this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8Z8985-FMM

Ok so first off the game is fun. It has solid gameplay it is competitive, and most importantly it is stable. 

The game is different from other first-person games flooding the market at the moment in that it rewards good tracking over twitch reactions. It goes back to the old days where hip-firing your weapons was the way to go, there is ADS but unless you are a sniper it isn't really used. 

The game is also extremely objective based, if you don't work with your team you will lose. Learn your role and play it, everyone depends on everyone else you aren't a lone wolf.

That being said if you are ready for a steep learning curve and want to get into a competitive game that require you to practice, this is the game for you.
Pros:
-Good game mechanics
-low system requirements
-not pay2win

Cons:
-Takes a bit too much time to get all the mercs
-Sometimes the netcode can be a little fucked up, even if you have good internet.

Overall:
Best fps in steam in the Play4Free section.
Play it. 
You won't regret it. It's a good game :)
By far my favorite FPS game on PC and one of the best i've played ever, with the added plus that it is FREEE! While it is not pay to win, it definitly requires skill and somewhat good reaction speed. It is incredibly fast paced, with battles happening across the various maps. It has a selection of 20 different mercs, with an array of abilities that include but not limited to land mines, airstrikes,and revive guns. It's devs pay close attention to their fan base and always try to respond, while keeping them up to date with every new piece added to the game. All in all, the best PC game I have played yet and it receives the highest recommendations I can give. A game worth playing :D

edit:they have added even more characters and weapons,
and I want my nomination task finished. Play Dirty!
EDIT: NOMINATE THIS GAME FOR THE LABOR OF LOVE AWARD!  

As a user who just started playng the game and just realized the devs are already signing off, I'm sad to find this game is being retired.  This is a real fun game.  But I'll probably hop on here and there.  If anyone knows of a comparable game (shooting mechanics, balancing, etc) please message me.  RIP
Dirty Bomb is one of those games that doesn't get as much attention as it should. Dirty Bomb has beautiful visuals and really solid gameplay coupled with a lot of pre-existing content, plus more to come in the future as it is still in development. There are still a few kinks to be worked out - The game can be buggy at times, especially after a fresh content update, but the dev team is devoted and works hard to fix up any bugs reported as quick as possible. One of the worst things about the game, however, is not directly to do with the game - It's just not popular enough to have a large player base, resulting in long search times and often, especially in places like Australia, there's just no-one nearby playing at all. However, one upside of this is that you get to meet great people and find them frequently. Overall, it's a really solid game with loads of potential for content and fanbase, and really deserves to get a lot more attention than it is at the moment.
[h1] Play While You Can [/h1]

No, seriously. It's a good game. Splash Damage has shut down developement, but still keep servers up. That's part 1. Part 2 is when servers go down. SO play while you can.
9/10
*Not pay2win
*Pay only if you want to gain credits quickly or customizations that won't affect your gameplay at all.
*Nice to play with friends
*Constant updates.
*Competitive.
Dirty Bomb is a fast paced, team based shooter offering addicting gameplay with its simple yet challenging mechanics, lovely mercenaries and objectives that wish to be completed. A mixture between aim heavy gameplay and abilities done right! An excellent recipe where all these elements come together and form what DB is - a truely unique, incomparable experience you won't find anywhere else but here. Despite some rather questionable balancing decisions (shotguns are the type of weapon I consider the exact opposite of skillful) I don't see myself stop playing anytime soon.

It's free2play, yet not pay2win, what are you waiting for?
Best FPS game that is fast paced & requires actual skill & teamwork to win. Mercs are very unique & memorable. People not having knowledge of this game's existecne is the only back draw & not even the bugs. People should really try this game because its fun , the game is free with no pay to win & the devs loved the game with passion they care so much about the game along with its players.
Dirty Bomb is a fast paced fps. I really enjoy the game mechanics. Hip fire is accurate along with aiming down sights and not one or the other. There is a variety of characters to choose from for many different play styles. Characters can wall jump, long jump, and crouch jump for different effects adding movement skills to the game. This game is free to play and paying for in-game items does not give you any advantages, just cosmetics. I wish the game had a different weapon system than loadout cards, but it is what is it. The game is focused around objectives and is similar to TF2. This game looks nicer than TF2 and everyone has a gun with a side ability. Aiming with the gun is the focus for most characters as side abilities can help get kills, repair or plant faster, or reviver fallen teammates. Great Game. Free to play. Give it a try.
It's a fun game that will one day make it out of beta. Worth atleast a try even if you are poor and Irish.

So most of the negative reviews I read go something along the lines of "omg this game sucks, p2w, tf2 is better". And its ok to dislike the game but man does this game feel so much less broken than Tf2 (still no hitbox fix Valve). The loadout system is wierd, but put in time and you do get the cards you want, of course you can play with all defaults and not feel underpowered. Unless your bad. My point is the game is playable for free to plays.
My only problem with the game is the small player base, but give it time and ,hopefully, it will get better.
A return to roots for Splash Damage, more reminiscent of ET and ET:QW than Brink. An excellent shooter, rewards aim and map awareness. Abilities are balanced so they are not preferred to guns. Mercs are *mostly* balanced, only a couple feel like they may need additional attention. 

The maps that exist are well balanced, and now that they own their own publishing rights hopefully new maps will come soon that will expand the game. Biggest complaint has been the length of time on development in introducing new features or getting out of beta.

Overall, my go too game when I have time to sit down and play.
RIdiculously fun movement system. The P2W mechanic is almost non-existent. You can easily achieve the ability to buy cases, and mercs through playing. The pace is fast, like COD, except all the Black Ops guy's did a bunch of crack before loading out, and are bouncing off the walls running at 100 mph. Highly suggest this game.
I would say this is a combonation of Counter-Strike and Team Fortress. It does allow aiming down the sights which is not necessary but it's great to have that option if you really like the sights on the gun or want to steady your aim. It's free to play, but they are vary fair on how their microtransactions work and the only advantage money will get you is getting all the characters/loadouts faster, but they are not hard to unlock anyway unless you want a specific look mainly. I figure after how many hours I have put into this game, and how often I return to it, I am officially ready to give this a good review. I do enjoy it.
This game is one of a kind and there is no other game that is both fast paced and objective oriented with an emphasis on team play. Can't believe I'm gonna say this but I will miss grinding(credits & fragments) and crafting a Gold sharc Javeline card only to get the same br16 card 5 times in a row. DB you will truly be missed along with the time I spent with my clan members.
On first glance, Dirty Bomb might look like yet another p2w Overwatch/ Team fortress clone, but that is not the case at all. Just like Overwatch and Team fortress 2, Dirty Bomb is a class based first person shooter, where in some maps you need to escort a payload, but this is where the similarities come to an end. The game is also not pay to win, but i will talk about that later. I can't think of anything in Dirty Bomb that wasn't seen in another game, but that doesn't mean that it's a bad game. It's the opposite, actually. Dirty Bomb mixes a lot of game mechanics from other games, and they work very well together.

Pros:

Skill based: Easy to learn, hard to master. The game has a high skill ceiling, and it requires good aim, traget tracking, map knowledge, game sense, and learning how to use the weapons and abilities of each merc. If you are looking for a casual game that doesn't require a lot of skill, this is not the game for you.

Unique map design: Each map has 2-3 primary objectives that the attacking team must complete in order to win. Additionally, each map has secondary objectives that can help a team to secure the primary objective. For example: blowing up/ repairing a gate that can open/ close a shortcut that leads to the primary objective. As a result, each map plays very differently than the other maps.

Fair business model: The game is not pay to win. The only things that you can't buy with in-game currency are boosters and better cases (These cases have a higher chance of containing a rarer loadout card). Moreover, each merc is not underpowered or overpowered, and the weapons are well balanced. Also, the loadout cards that the players can get only give you different weapons and perks, and from bronze-tier cards and up, the only difference between the cards is that they provide better skins.

Server browser: Even with the game's relatively small playerbase, you can almost always get into a match since the game has a server browser.

No cheaters: A lot of players claim that the game is infested with cheaters, but i played it for almost 200 hours and i only encountered one cheater.

Cons:

Lack of content: The game has only 6 maps for objective mode and 3 maps for execution mode.
For a few months, the devs focused on fixing bugs and because of that no new content was added to the game. It may take a while until new maps or mercs are addded to the game. For me its not a problem since i can play the same map for hours on end without getting bored.

The mercs are not cheap, and it can take a long time to get enough money to buy one, but since you get 2 mercs for free, and 3 different mercs are available to try out for free every week, this is not a big problem. You can also get more money by completing challenges that reset once every 3 hours.

In conclusion, Dirty Bomb is a very fun, fast paced and challenging game with a fair business model and i think that you should try it out since it is free.
Dwindling playerbase means the large majority of players are devoted, long time veterans, etc. As a newbie, this game is unforgiving. You'll spend most of your time being stomped by teams of high level players while you wonder what just happened.

The game can be very rewarding and enjoyable once you become good at it, but to the average player just coming to try out the game, reaching that stage will be impossible due to how frustrating playing against these better players is.

If you're looking for a game to play sparingly, I would steer clear unless we somehow get a huge influx of new players to dilute the average skill level. However, if you're commited to pour a lot of time into the game or you're already skilled at other FPS games, then you'll probably have a better experience.

Even though the balance and absurd average skill level frustrates me at times, there is the occasional good experience in a match that keeps me coming back to play. Level 80-100s are the norm, I myself am level 20 after 250 hours of playtime, to put that into perspective.
Hinestly, this is a surprisingly good find. It doesn't look particularly good if you look at the trailers, but this is definitely the case when you do not judge by the cover. 

If you like fast-paced multiplayer shooter, this is for you. Fan of Overwatch, TF2 and alike? This is for you.  Just go ahead and play it, you won't regret it.

For me, the beauty of the game is that you don't really feel bad when you've lost. It's like "meh, we lost but we had a good time."
Great game, the successor of Brink, last and also brilliant game from SD!

I'm a big fan of Brink with more than 1000h in multiplayer and I can say that Dirty Bomb made a lot of quality stuff from the Brink in a different way, adding that many unique innovations and dynamics, and an excellent team play what is nowhere seen before in any game!!!

Fantastic job Splash Damage!
"We're not soldiers, we're hired guns, there's only one thing we fight for, COLD, HARD, CASH."

Cons:

10/10 Phantom main
As far as free to play shooters are concerned, Dirty Bomb is as quality as it gets. This game is great and deserves way more players. Highly recommended.
Just like for Halo Online, I believe this game will never truly die, instead being maintained by a small community of loyal fans. And while relieved at that thought...I'm still very sad to see that the playerbase is so small. I'm also dumbstruck. How could it be that such a great game never picked up in popularity?

Let me reiterate the value proposition of ths game: a fast-paced shooter with an excellent game mechanics and a timeless art-style not dissimilar from Halo or Borderlands. Everything in the game can be unlocked by simply playing it and there are virtually no microtransactions: anything you can purchase is cosmetic (unlike pay-to-win items in other games) and you have no obligation: everything in the game can be earned fairly quicly just by playing.

Unlike titles like Star Wars Battlefront, Destiny, Fallout 76 etc... that are all so desperately cash-grabby with their microtransactions, this game doesn't have those greedy unethical tactics. 

AND

It has a subreddit with devs that have been actively responding to questions/requests, respectfully and not insulting players like the recent debacles at certain unamed Big-AAA companies. 

This game was made by good people, who gave us, the players, every ounce of energy they could to make the experience of this game worthwhile. This kind of goodwill is rare in today's marketplace. This game is a precious gem that comes out once in a blue moon.

If nothing else, I hope that at the very least this review encourages you to TRY it.
I fell in love with this game in 2017. I had some of the most memorable gaming moments with my friends! I hope this game maintains its playerbase and I will stick with this game till the end. Try it, you just may enjoy it and stick around!
Best multiplayer FPS with different classes and abillities with the absolute perfect BALLANCE ! 
Noone is too strong or too weak - just everything is perfect.
I've started playing Dirty bomb back then in 2015 and almost 4 years later I still feel and believe that this is the best multiplayer FPS game for me.
My compliments to Splash damage (the developers) their relentless work made the game almost perfect. They were always surprising us with new maps, mercs, game modes and events. The events were absolutely brilliant and the rewards from them were great !
I don't event want to start saying my opinion about skins, level design, environment =)
I will always higly reccomend @DB even to people which do not love so much FAST Pased 3D shooters, this game contains and teaches us to so many different things like team play, tactics, good timing.
Also this is Dirty bomb - the community is and it has always been for me 1 of the best gaming communities.

[b]Final Verdict: [spoiler]9/10[/spoiler][/b]
First of all I've really enjoyed this game over the years, but I constantly uninstall it and reinstall it over and over again. The game is fun, but there are just some dated design decisions that keep it lagging behind most other shooters. Everything beyond this point is my opinion, but I'll try to stay objective. Also, I'm a bit rusty so excuse any mistakes I make.

Pros:
-Each role feels distinct and offer different playstyles.
-Different weapons within categories often feel different and are sidegrades.
-Possible to unlock every loadout and merc just by playing.
-Every charcter feels fast, and every weapon feels viable in the right hands.
-Objective based modes make use of most every role.
-Quick play and Stopwatch (Swapping Sides) and competitve play are free to engage with out of the gate.

Neutral:
-High Time To Kill
-Diverse cast of mercs.
-Variety in loadouts it there should you engage with that.
-Graphics are a bit dated by this point.

Cons:
-Loadout Card system is limiting, and weird. Why can't we assemble our own loadouts?
-Forced camos based on card rarity is just tacked on for seemingly no reason.
-All loadout cards beyond Silver (Some cards don't come in Bronze anymore) are basically Gucci, or Supreme level luxuries for when you need to burn fragments.
-Servers can be full one minute, then gone the next. Small-ish community.
-Difficult to play with friends.

Despite all of this, I can't give this game more than a 7.5 out of 10. Seven just feels a tad too low, and and eight feels too high. The game is enjoyable, but it isn't perfect. Personally I think it feels a little too rigid in the way you can only choose three mercs with you per game. Then on top of that, attempting to use the loadout you may want may cost you a lot of ingame currency, then if you don't enjoy that loadout as much as you thought you would feels like a waste. I think this game just has too many things to pay for with ingame currency, but that may be a good thing for some people. Grinding is fulfilling for some people and may feel like a waste of time for others.

Bottom Line: Game isn't perfect, 7.5 out of 10. Spending ingame currency doesn't always feel like a good transacation took place, and sometimes you can be grouped up with a team unable to handle your opponents due to the rigid loadout, and three merc slots per game.
A true hidden gem I have enjoy this as much as Overwatch,I can only imagine what this game might have been if the developers had the same resources as OW does,here your skill will matther the most,no cheessy plays using Ults, DB as good as OW but with out boobs,ass and ults
oh boy, the memories, i could have given some advices at the time but i have no experience on the market. maybe cheaper stuff for f2p or something in the matter, i haven't spend a dime on this game but fucking hell i would have be worth it, i regret not supporting this wonderful people.
Great game, until it died. I can't really say much, because I really didn't play much, but it was my jumpstart to the gaming community and gaming in general. Rest in peace.
Great game, really fun to play.
Takes a while to get past the 'lol just shoot enemies' stage and actually learn how to play.
Once you get it, it is really fun!
I'll miss you Sparks..~ You were.. well.. You were a horrifically broken piece of shit I cheesed to victory, but you were the most unique, quirky Medic I've played in a game and even after all these years I haven't found anything that's been remotely as satisfying.

R.I.P to one of the most cancerous fanbases I've ever seen and one of the best shooters I've ever played
I have spent 2000 hours in Dirty Bomb and I don't regret any of them!!! I really enjoyed the game from the first day to the last one I played it. I kinda felt like the game was dying some time before they actually announced that spalsh damage wasn't going to work anymore on the game, it was a sad moment for whoever loved this community and the game. Anyway one of my favourite F2P games of all time, sad to see development stopping. It's really heartbreaking. Nevertheless a great game. Thanks Dirty Bomb for the fun, the amazing matches and the memories! 

Paracetamol here, over and out! V, 2, 1! <3

It's a great game, even though it's noty going to get any more updates at all, it's still a good game. And because the developers can't make any more money off fo this game, all of the ingame items can now be purchased with ingame currency that you get for playing so there's always a bright side
[h1]Intro[/h1]
Dirty Bomb is 1 of the best shooters to come out of this past decade and arguably 1 of the best shooters of all time. I won‚Äôt give a history lesson in this review of the complicated issues with the devs. If you want a quick summary on that you can click [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJ-4dCOecFo]here.[/url] Instead I want to give a review on whether or not the game is worth your time in its current state.

[h1]Da Core[/h1]
The base of Dirty Bomb is that it is a free, class and objective based FPS with a strong emphasis on teamwork. Running on the Unreal 3 engine it has some of the best netcode in the FPS market today (which may or may not say something about the current state of FPS games as a whole depending on how you stand on the code). Combined with a silky smooth movement and parkour system and you have a very high skilled game. Someone gets the shot on you first? Well, if you can jump along the walls that you‚Äôre in, know your weapons, and aim well you can easily overcome your enemy. The game has a perk system in the form of loadout cards of varying tiers that can change very slight features of the game in such a way it can cater to your playstyle as well as different weapons suited to your merc's specific role. The number of mercs is good and the different weapons loadouts create multiple ways to play. And while the game is class based and requires teamwork, you can still carry. You hear in games like CS:GO or TF2 you can carry a team but those usually require you be smurfing or (in TF2‚Äôs case) have 1 or 2 pocket Medics up your ass to keep you alive like the bad spam-happy Soldier or Demo player that you are. In DB, the mechanics are set up in such a way that even if you are on team potato you can still win the game by yourself despite your team only having 1k points each and everyone on the enemy team having 9k+. There‚Äôs nothing quite like planting C4 and holding off the entire enemy team solo and despite all the odds being against you. To give an old analogy: it‚Äôs like a combo of BF, CoD, and OW in 1 game. This alone is why you can see so many players with 1k+ hours despite the game‚Äôs complicated past.

[h1]Mercs and Balance[/h1]
While I cannot go into every single merc in this review without this point taking up the majority, if you want a quick rundown click [url=https://www.dirtybomb.com/#mercs]here[/url] to get an understanding of who you‚Äôll be playing as. The main thing I want to discuss is the balance, or lack thereof. Certain mercs like Skyhammer, Aura, Bushwhacker, Arty, Stoker, and Phoenix are all around well balanced. Then you have certain mercs like Proxy, Javelin, Kira, Hunter, Phantom, and Fletcher that vary in degrees of annoying from ‚ÄúThis guy is getting a bit annoying‚Äù to ‚ÄúHoly shit! Will someone please kill that fucking X?!‚Äù And then you have mercs that are absolute crutches like Turtle, Sparks, Fragger, and Guardian[spoiler]no seriously, FUCK YOU if you play Guardian[/spoiler]that can single-handedly carry a team with little to no effort and turn above average players in to absolute gods. And if there are 2+ of these mercs in the hands of decent players then forget about even trying to win. This led to multiple balancing issues along the development of DB and some of them even helped kill off what remaining playerbase there was. While those that were OP have been nerfed to a better state, it still wasn‚Äôt enough. The 1 redeeming feature is that no matter who you are playing as, you will more than likely be enjoying yourself. Just keep in mind that not every merc is fun to play against. 

[h1]What's on Offer[/h1]
Along with mercs, what you get in terms of weapons, customization, and maps is good. Very good. The problem though is that you can see everything in a 100 hour time frame. Let‚Äôs take the maps for example. The maps are simple but well designed. However, in your first 3-5 matches you will get an idea of how each 1 is laid out. By your tenth match on them you will know them inside and out and where all the useful points are. If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôll be itching for new modes and maps to play. Unfortunately it will never happen. Even in the beta this was an issue. I put 40 hours into the game when I originally picked it up back in 2016 and since January of 2019 have put in another 26 hours only to be getting bored with the content on hand. Again. Some players can put thousands of hours into the game experimenting with different mercs or trying to unlock cosmetics/loadouts, but I feel what is on offer now simply doesn‚Äôt hold up. It's good, but not at a proper level. Example: I recently bought an Obsidian (very high tier) card for 1 of my favorite mercs using in-game currency. And to be honest? I liked my Bronze (very low tier) loadout better. Not to mention weapons skins in this game are just flat out ugly. To some this will increase their drive to get better gear. To me it just made me lose interest in wanting to keep playing this second time around. It all depends on you as a person I suppose.

[h1]Cheaters[/h1]
It was a major issue back in 2016 and somewhat of an issue now. In the NA server pool there are 2 players that quiet clearly cheat. Depending on your region this can be a major problem. Aimlocks and low TTK have been an issue that Splash Damage could never get around to fixing.

[h1]Current Playerbase[/h1]
The current playerbase of DB is roughly 300. This means you will have less variety in the people that you meet. In my case based on my region it was a mix of either players with decent ping or third worlders with 120+. With the third worlders 1 of 2 things will happen: either they will be God awful at the game and contribute nothing other than the occasional cheap death due to latency or they will be half decent at the game and when they shoot you, you will die before you knew what hit you due to the lag comp. If you‚Äôre going up against a team with 120+ ping for the majority of their players then you may be in for some rage and salt. Also, they are the ones that CONSTANTLY try to shuffle the teams rather than try to improve. Like, the second they feel like the game isn't fair even if the match has been going on for a minute they will spam the shuffle option until the tides have turned. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
I can honestly say I enjoyed my time with DB. Despite all the rage. All the salt. All the times cursing out bad teammates. All the curb stomps and curb stomping. I had fun. I do genuinely wish it could‚Äôve gotten the attention and care it needed to become something more but the days of wishful thinking are long gone. I enjoyed the last 26 hours I put into it this past month and a half. While the game definitely has its flaws, I would be hard pressed to be able to recommend another multiplayer FPS at this time. It‚Äôs 100% free from downloading to in game content. Give it a shot when you get the chance. When the day comes that the last of the DB servers shut down I will be genuinely sad to see a game with such a great potential go away. Hopefully your experiences through all the rage, salt, and gittin gewd will be 1 you can look back on with a smile. I know I can.
Not worth playing at the moment, game's been on a downward spiral since the MOFO update. Pushing out maps that still needs tweaking, mercs that are still overpowered regardless of their so called "balancing", weapon recoil gone through the roof over the years and some abilities that are still buggy. Not to mention that they've implemented more microtransactions in the form of skin cases to further milk the few dedicated players that still enjoy the game and continue to support the devs. (Which recently changed so credits can now be used to buy keys but they have also made credit grinding even more tedious.)

Dirty Bomb 1.0 and FACEIT will not save the game if the devs don't fix the core issues that has caused so many people to quit playing the game out of frustration due to the fact that they feel as if their opinions are going into one ear and flying through the next.

I really enjoy this game's core design as a fast paced shooter where any role can frag while still being a team player while being very fluid in regards to movement and I don't regret my hours invested, however due to the direction the devs are going I cannot force myself to be so optimistic about the game's survival as the numbers continue to dwindle from my favourite FPS of all time. What we can do now is hope the devs proves all of us wrong so I can actually recommend this masterpiece.

Thanks for the awesome memories.
I used to love this game. It was one of the best multiplayer fps experience I had since Battlefield 3. Really fast-paced and fun gameplay with a lot of good features, even more when playing with a few friends, and most games were really close, sometimes struggling until the very last seconds to finally complete the objective. One week ago I was about to leave a positive review since I really enjoyed playing lately.

But all of that was until the last update came out. The worst 1GB of crap I've ever downloaded. They took out the matchmaking system which was actually working like intended and replaced it with a quick join system which isn't.

You cannot even join a game with friends anymore. Really ?
And even if you join a friend's game (once you waited for someone to leave to take his place), you're not even sure you'll be in your friend's team.

And worse, once you finish a game, instead of leaving and starting another matchmaking like before, assuring a fair match and letting you join with friends, now the game launches another game even when there are not enough players and not balancing one bit. I got into a 4 people team against a 6 people team from a starting game (my friend being in the other team of course but whatever). It's a team-based fps, no matter how hard one can carry, you cannot have a 2 people difference between two teams. It's simply inconceivable.

Remember the close games where you fought until the last second ? Yeah, basically forget about it, almost every game is now a one-sided steamroll. So, yeah, one week ago, I would have given this game something like a 9/10 but not anymore. 

Devs, if you read this, which I doubt, it's time to press the "fuck, go back" button. 
Reverse the game to it's previous state and I (and a lot of other players I think) will reverse our mind.
Alright, let's get this out of the way first: I've played Dirty Bomb since June 2015 on and off, and I've since clocked over 1,300 hours in the game. I enjoy the game, or, at least, I used to. Let's take it back to Summer Squash. This was a period of content drought in which the devs focused on fixing bugs instead of adding new stuff, and just prior to this, the game received multiple new mercs, new maps, a new gamemode, ranked, huge events, new cosmetics, weapon and merc balancing, the whole deal. Ignoring the whole part where NGS caused massive performance issues for most players and the only way to "fix" these crippling problems was to limit the program via third party software, the devs had a split with the company that owned the anti-cheat and published the game, Nexon. Now, I'm not part of the disclosure between Splash Damage and Nexon, but the way everything was phrased, that they were "taking back Dirty Bomb" never made sense to me. The way SD blamed Nexon made me feel like they were just using the company's bad reputation as a scapegoat for their own shortcomings, and I felt like nothing would change after Nexon was cut out of the equation.

Eight months later, I was right.

In an effort to make good on their promises to be more transparent, the developers began releasing weekly dev videos and increasing community manager activity on the subreddit and discord, as well as adding an FAQ thread on the forums(which turned out to just be softball questions with extremely vague and useless answers). Much of this didn't last, and by July, while they were still active and responding, it seemed like they were deliberately ignoring community feedback and just giving out copy/paste responses to all questions and concerns.

One of the main problems most long-term players have with the game is the state of merc balance. Certain weapons available to multiple mercs, such as burst rifles, the Dreiss AR, and sniper rifles, clearly out-perform and out-class all other weapons in the game, including shotguns and automatics. Certainly they've been changing weapon balance to address these issues, right? Well, actually, it appears that they've either given up or don't know how to balance anything because they haven't done many major changes since before the split from Nexon, the only important change being the body damage on revolvers and the GSR.

In fact, prior to the Rogue en Vogue event, the company made balance changes surrounding Thunder, a merc whose stats were changed to the point where he could just drop a conc mid-firefight and win every time due to his access to the Stark AR, an overpowered burst weapon that out-DPSes most guns in the game, 170hp that overshadows all but one merc, and the excruciatingly long flash time on the conc, which also reduces movement speed and makes all players affected essentially unable to fight back or dodge. These balance issues were not addressed for over 14 months following this, and even then only minuscule changes were made after nearly an entire ranked season of triple-Thunder stacks.

One of the main reasons he was horrendously OP is the Stark AR, which was hardly touched and remains one of the strongest guns in the game, while guns like the timik and shotguns remain utterly sub-par.

With the release of the new mercs Javelin and Guardian, however, it's become painfully obvious that the devs can't hear us from the high walls of their castle. Javelin came with a 1 second charge time on a rocket launcher that does 400 damage on direct hits and can be guided around corners. One of the main reasons Thunder couldn't be avoided or countered before is the 0.9 second cook time on his conc. The devs, though, admitted that they intended to ship Javelin without any charge time on the rocket launcher at all, which says a lot about how much they know about their own game, when the TTK for most weapons is over 1 second on a dodging target for even the most accurate players.

In an effort to show their players that they listen, they changed the AoE on the rocket, its damage, increased the charge sound, and added a laser on the guided mode to help prevent low-skill panic rockets. The problem is that the audio system is so broken that the charge sound doesn't play most of the time, the laser is only visible for the guided mode, which hardly anyone uses until after they've fired the rocket(you can change it mid-flight, making it impossible to predict), and the charge time is still so low that players on the receiving end don't have enough time to react or even kill the Javelin charging the rocket.

Let's not even talk about how they ignored the issues with her ammo and instead nerfed it so hard that you can't even receive ammo from a Javelin anymore. However, Javelin isn't even that OP. At this point, Javelin is a low-skill version of Fragger whose only gimmick is her ability to kill people before they have time to react. Javelin is the definition of a completely mishandled merc release.

Guardian, the most recent combat "medic" is a merc who has the ability to AoE revive on cooldown, has no self-healing abilities, and can drop a shield that deletes all projectiles in the game. Yes, you heard me, her special ability is to counter all explosives and thrown abilities. All of them.

Now, to someone who doesn't know how important explosives are, this won't sound so bad. Sure, she's a hard-counter merc who fucks almost every other merc in the game, but you can still shoot her, right? The problem with that is the part where existing Aura station setups allow players to hold a defensive position where you can't get close to the station to kill it or the people on it, and one of the only ways to clear it out is with explosives. Which Guardian hard-counters. Yep. Maps that were already incredibly hard to break for offense because of Aura setups(looking at you, Chapel) are now even harder to break!

The main thing that's driving me away is the crippling performance issues that've been progressively getting worse of the past 4+ months. At first, it was just a few random hitches or stutters in-game, later it was frame drops below 100, and now I can hardly hit 100 FPS in combat, and without a config and third party program to limit the horrible CoherentUI system, the framerate drops below 30 frequently enough to make aiming impossible. Server performance since the Javelin patch has also been degrading, and it's now at the point where I and the group I play with will have rubberbanding and hit registration issues on as low as 30 ping with a stable connection, not to mention the issues on 100+ ping because of the awful netcode.

I could go on for hours about how badly the game runs, but I have a character limit to beat.

I'm often told I must hate the game because of how much I criticize the devs, but the truth is that I do it because I love it and I want it to succeed. However, I can't justify spending a dime on the game because the monetization system is absolute garbage and not consumer-friendly in the least. I also can't recommend the game in its current state because, while the game itself is awesome and incredibly fun, the glaring issues are too numerous and problematic that the game is honestly in a pretty bad state.

Overall, the game is fantastic, but I can't endorse the direction it's going. The whole appeal of the game is the ability for a player to win every firefight regardless of which character they're playing, a principle the devs appear to have either completely forgotten or abandoned entirely. Don't get yourself sucked into this game, wait until it goes full release and see if the devs actually return to the roots that made the game so great or if they turn it into just another counter-based MOBA shooter with no emphasis on individual skill. Wait and see if snipers continue to overshadow all other mercs like they have for over 2 years. Wait and see if the devs actually care.

Update: They don't. Find something else to play.
Game is dead. Everyone can move along. 

Disclaimer: 

Since this has blown up, I'm getting notifications spammed at me, and folks seem that it's ok to comment with threats toward me(which I will just delete). I'm open to criticism on any of these points. If you think I'm wrong, you must be very clear on your counter argument. Give examples and prove me wrong. I'm more than happy to change any of it. I didn't even bring up aim punch, and why it was even added, and people got mad at this? As it stands, calling me, stupid, dumb, and childish flat out solidify my points. Remember, I am, was, a customer to this company, much like yourself. If you think I'm the only person that feels this way, head to their forums, or head to Reddit. These issues come up every single day. If you are also a customer, you should feel angry too. It blows my mind that people still stand behind Spalsh Damage. 

Review:

I want to honestly say that this game use to be fun to play. However, over the past year or so, Splash Damage have done nothing but continue to make their game worse, and spit in paying players faces.

Where should I begin?

- They've talked down to players with critical feedback on their own forums. Reddit, and on their company Discord. A couple of friends were banned from forums and their Discord for trying to provide ideas about issues, only to be yelled at and condisended to.

- They removed Objective Mode servers in the two largest regions to make way for a match making system which doesn't work. I'm assuming someone at a professional studio would understand you actualy need people playing your game for a system like this to work properly. I guess common sense eludes even professionals. 

- They refuse to release a SDK for the community to run their own servers.So tired of playing a first-person shooter with over 100 ping. It's 2018, not 1999. I use to play Day of Defeat back on WON on a local server with 30 ping on DSL. Unexceptable. 

- Their in-game UI is slow, buggy, and destroys game preformance. Forcing players to use custom potato configs to even play.

- They've over nerfed weapons and mercs solely on pick rate as opposed to actual numbers.Sniper Rifles and machine pistols have been nerfed so far into the ground. All the while shotguns have been untouched. No one is going to play a merc that doesn't either have healing, ammo, or area denial in a competitive atmosphere. Put your heads back on.

- They refuse to buff weapons and mercs that see little play.

- Their Anti-Cheat is one of the worst I've ever seen. Be careful of F2P accounts ruining your ranked games with no action from Spash Damage.

- The player count is at an all-time low. Best of luck trying to find any so called "balanced" matches as anyone who use to care about this game, or who knew how to actually play it, have all moved on. 

- Paying players were insulted from past exclusive skin purchases by them rereleasing them with the superior loadout(This happened to me). Thanks for ripping me off. I should have seen it coming. I blame myself. 

 - The team and community manager have made it very clear that they aren't taking anyone's feedback seriously. Every post done by Shoe, on here, Reddit, Discord, or their official Youtube channel is simply a smoke screen to cover up the notition that they have no interest in what you want or what they're even doing. 

Please avoid this game and this developer on any future projects or events. They need a serious attitude adjustment and an understanding that without people buying their overpriced cosmestics and mercs, that their game that they've been developing for 4 some odd years, will simply die.

Anyone remember Brink? That game that was in used Gamestop bins the first week it was out? Yea, me either. Old habits die hard I suppose.

___________________________________

A response to the developer as the comment section can only hold a max of 1000 characters;

I'm not going to contact SD directly as it didn't effect me, but it did effect a friend and player that truly wanted this game to be great that I use to play with and still talk to on a daily basis. 

SD Moobs, a developer, couldn't take someone telling him that a certain merc wasn't a great counter to a meta defense. He lashed back saying that this player wasn't a developer, he didn't know what he was talking about, maybe he should apply to be one, and linked the company page. A bit later my friend was banned from their Discord with no way to prove his side of the story. There was no malicious intent, no disrespect, just a true statement about  the current competitive side to a merc. Sad really.

Shoe, the Community Manager that so happened to comment here, asked for logs, as my friend could not provide them because of the ban, Shoe says, and I quote as I've seen the screen caps of this conversation, 

"That's the only way I'll be able to check it".

What? So, instead of unbanning him for him to check the log, you just close the door and sit behind someone who clearly has issues with the player base's critique of your, still, broken, game. 

Now that I'm here, I really have no idea why I wasted the time to write this up. It's not like anyone at Splash Damage cares. He wasn't a whale, and I sure as hell wasn't a whale, and after I was taken advantage of, there's no way they're seeing anymore money or play time from me. 

Anyone that's reading this, there are other developers out there that will listen and deserve your hard earned money. This company is not one of them. If you are playing completely free, more power to you. If you enjoy playing the game with what little player base it still has, more power to you. I for one, am done. The game has been uninstalled and there's going to be very little that will ever bring me back. Hell would have to freeze over for these guys to throw some common sense our way. 

But what do I know right? I'm not a developer.
UPDATED July 2018: The state of the game hasn't improved much at all, the playerbase is at it's all-time low, devs have stated no new maps will be coming, dev communication is even worse than when this review was first written. They've made a handful of good changes but the game probably doesn't have long left. 

UPDATED November 2018: End of development announced.

Dirty Bomb is a great game. Not p2w, no hackers and great gameplay make it into an overall good experience. I still can't recommend it to anyone. Other reviews have already given good explanations as to what this game is, a skill-based objective-focused competitive shooter. You can play as different characters, however the game doesn't revolve around abilities.

First, the pros. On it's surface, the game is excellent. It's not p2w, there's no way to buy advantages. Paying money is purely cosmetic even if this isn't communicated well. Hackers are rare, and in 316 hours I've seen around 4 total. Graphics and animations are good. It's also one of the few games where it's fun to play as a medic because you can actually kill as them. There's a high skill ceiling, made up largely of aim and movement. Characters are mostly well-made with good voicelines and no cringeworthy ones. As a whole, it seems like a good package before it all falls apart. 

For starters, there's no competitive scene at all. Ranked is dead, with a whole host of issues. Long queue times, unbalanced matches, glitches that give MM penalties for no reason, games starting 5v4, inability to votekick griefers, crazy amounts of grinding necessary to get any skins and several others. The only community competitive is almost totally disregarded by SD, who don't seem to care for any sort of competitive mode. Streamers are all gone as well, moving on to games like Fortnite and Overwatch. 

Another huge issue is that SD doesn't know how to balance. Burst rifles are a little OP? MAKE THEM TOTAL RNG. Phantom needs a small change? FULL INVISIBILITY AND EVRY OTHER POSSIBLE BUFF. Changing things in increments and fine-tuning balance is not possible for SD. A refusal to listen to actual community feedback and instead choosing to only consider their TeLeMeTrY causes this changes.

Confused game direction is also causing serious issues. SD markets the game as a high skill competitive shooter, but adds panic buttons like Javelin's rocket. A shift towards abilities over gunplay goes against the fundamentals of the game, as it moves towards rock-paper-scissors style counters. Aimpunch, which the community has expressed massive distaste towards, has actually been increased in recent months. SD is unable to give any reason as to why this was, making up weird excuses that no one understands. 

What about bugs? Ohhh boy we got a lot of these. Downed mercs slide up and down walls making them extremely hard to revive. The vehicle you escort is a broken mess and the devs have no intention to fix it. Rockets can bounce off walls and hit you, counting as suicides. Mines cannot be destroyed by explosives at all. The netcode sucks. Airstrike markers sometimes disappear and give you a full cooldown. Shotguns get infinite reloading glitches and weapon switch glitches. Hunter's arrows have broken hitboxes and can't hit mercs who are on MGs. The list goes on and on and on.

Also, we heard you like low skill abilities! What about a panic button rocket? What about an invisible merc?  What about a spammy crossbow? What about landmines? More and more stuff like these have been pulling the game away from it's roots as a skill based shooter. Merc stacking is also in full force, with 4 Arty's being able to make any escort objective a slog. 

The game's microtransaction system is atrocious. It may not be p2w, but it's extremely grindy and RNG-based. Unlocking mercs is difficult due to the absurd grind, which can suck enjoyment out of the game. Every single cosmetic is locked behind expensive RNG. 5$ can easily get you a scratched-up, awful looking skin for a gun you don't use and you can't recycle it. Getting a single cobalt card that you want can cost hundreds of crafting kits and cases. You can also be stuck with duplicate special editions and have no way to recycle or trade them, meaning you wasted your time. Events are also awful grindfests.

This review hasn't even touched on:
-lack of dev communication
-lack of maps
-removal of private matches for no reason
-removal of ability to use commands to test things in "offline mode"
-terrible UI
and loads of issues I'm forgetting about.

Anyways, don't play this game. Splash Damage will disappoint you.
I find DB has drifted from what I would want in a game to something I don't like. More importantly, I don't think it will improve enough to enjoy going forward, so I'm going to uninstall DB.

The fundamental reason I'm going to uninstall is that the initial and early characters didn't feel too gimmicky, and they tended to work together. Since that time, they've become more and more ridiculous. Constantly putting in characters that don't really mesh together isn't helping the team aspect of the game. When you can help your team while still shooting the enemy and not need to make a decision about which to do, you have a problem. Throwing health packs, ammo, and needing to be on top of people to revive them encourages smart team play. "Don't run into the open, we can't pick you up" Sparks the medic comes out, and more fools over-extend because you can revive them now at a distance, instead of them being dead and gibbed, and they can be picked up. Not being revived is the game punishing bad play by those who over-extend. Javelin dispenses ammo even in fire-fights, so who needs to manage and plan for their ammo? Getting into long fire-fights back in 2015 used to require someone to be very good at managing ammo and position. You had to bring a support character, but that person needed excellent positioning to be able to toss that pack and hit a teammate who needs it without giving it to the enemy, and then quickly be back in the fight. The same is true of the medics. Running a combo of medic/ammo giver required great support. Automatically dispensing ammo in a circle around you doesn't force you to think about how to help your team, and you can help without actively helping. You can both help you team with a power, and shoot an enemy. This isn't encouraging teammates to help each other, it just encourages them to bunch up. Further, key abilities can be done by everyone, like repairing, planting explosives, and reviving. This dilutes the need to take certain classes at all.

Further, rarely has a new character been balanced on release, which means in the the intervening time between release and patch you face a lot of people playing a broken character. In-fact, new characters were never allowed straight into ranked. They would hold them back because they knew they weren't balanced. They eventually gets nerfed, frequently too far, and the cycle repeats. This is irritating, but I also know that characters aren't balanced until you really get a lot of people playing them. I don't know why they feel so far off each time, but I suspect it is because of the aforementioned decision to keep pushing out characters that have odd abilities that need to be special to justify making a new merc. Balancing among more and more abilities also takes more and more effort - effort that could be spent making the one thing that doesn't get enough attention - maps.

Maps. You need more maps. You always need more maps. More maps means more unique strategies, it means you can play a lot of matches without repeating maps (back when there were only 6 maps, I took lots of several week or several month breaks because I didn't want to play the same maps over and over). Each map should highlight a few abilities. You can get the objective done without them and successfully defend without them, but on some maps, some characters should shine without being overpowered. Each map should be able to take advantage of each merc's abilities. I know this is a tall order, but you want to be great, right? The more abilities you have, the more trouble you have where you get into a map and think, "I brought a terrible merc for this map." That should not happen, ever. Rhino is a good example. There are some maps where I will never take him, he's far too slow, and he needs to be on top of people to do damage. There are too many maps where he cannot do much, and very few maps where he can truly shine. Similarly, taking Skyhammer or Arty in Underground, is a waste of time (Skyhammer's marker does act like a grenade, but it isn't a great one). Stoker, on the other hand, dominates in Undergound because his ability is always useful. There is no need for that enormous discrepancy between characters. This removes flexibility to form and break defenses. 

While this is definitely a personal preference, the worst part about this game is being one-shot. I don't know why people think this is fun in an arcade-style shooter. In ARMA, SWAT, Rainbow 6, being one-shot killed is fine and I like those games, but not in a game like this. It wasn't fun 20 years ago with the rocket launchers in Quake and Unreal, it still isn't now. The wide-spread availabilty and ease-of-use of one-shot weapons in this game is killing my enjoyment (and I realize that this is a very personal complaint, hence the reason I listed it last). The fact that most people cannot use one-shot weapons well in a fast-moving arcade-style shooter doesn't make them balanced. In any game, when you balance to the average, you neglect that part of the population who will take the time needed to perfect the one-shot (or power, skill, etc.) who will still continue to dominate with over-powered weapons/abiliites, etc. This is where the accurate arcade-style shooting and movement work against you - perfecting that one-shot is 100% doable. I've met and seen plenty of people who have perfected it. For awhile, I could do it pretty well, but it felt really cheap and dirty, so I stopped. Once you master the one-shot kill, it's a joke for those who don't. Removing scope sway on snipers - terrible move, the sway at least made the one-shot kills reasonably rare but threatening. The reviver railgun of doom - terrible move. I still stuck around, despite really not liking these changes. The additional of Javelin was another change that I didn't like. What purpose does she serve? There are characters who can break-up camps, if they're not doing the job, adjust them! Instead, you put in the one-shot rocket of doom, something I was really proud of you for not putting in the game from day one. An arcade style game balanced without a rocket launcher. Ponder that. We had that.

Coming back after a long break, I wanted to see how the game progressed. I see the new characters introduced, and one of them is Hunter - he has a crossbow that can one-shot people. After playing a few games against people with Hunter, I can see once again that the higher-skilled players are STILL taking the high-damage sniper rifles, and Hunter. I used to accept being one-shot as part of the game, but I just don't want to deal with it anymore. If I want to be killed in one shot while moving around a corner, I'll play the SWAT and Rainbow 6 games - realistic shooters. Not in arcade shooters. I want teamwork, but that can't be had, because not enough abilities force you to support or rely your team. I used to think that the self-healing that all mercs have was fine, but as time went on, I found myself drawn to characters that had "tough" perk because I didn't need a medic. Ammo is easy to come by, generally, and rarely do you need to go far out of the way to get it, so who needs those pesky teammates? Going to get ammo shouldn't be easy, a team game should prefer you to get it from teammates, and hence punish you by having inconvenient ammo supply locations.

In case you are wondering, I don't play Overwatch. I saw enough in the videos to know that it wasn't what I was looking for. And now, very sadly, I must conclude that Dirty Bomb joins it.

Finally, I apologize for mistakes - I edited this heavily to make sure my thoughts were coordinated, but I suspect there are errors still left.
Incompetent devs that make bad decisions after bad decisions. Game has no hope left for an enjoyable competitive experience or even a casual one. Pubs are cancer and their only comp mode is now gone. They have plans on releasing a third party platform called faceit(similar to esea) for that comp experience but it's hardly going to change anything because the root of the problem with ranked was that the playerbase was too low and the skill gap between players are too far apart. Even if the comp aspect is not what you're looking to get out of in this game, pubs are just as bad because it's filled with low skilled players that don't really know how to play the game. Granted the game has a high skill ceiling but I genuinely feel that most players simply don't care to learn. Javelin was a mistake and the devs responded to the cries of the community by releasing a merc that cockblocks explosives(except for lasers) but all that did was slow down the gameplay for the worse. Turtle's shield is also bad for the game and for new players especially because it teaches them bad behaviors in fps games. Hiding behind a shield will not help them learn how to move in a firefight or to get behind practical cover. Last but not least phantom in his current state is just a big slap in the face to the playerbase. He is simply a broken merc that doesn't belong in the game. He was fine before this update but a lot of vets have simply quit because this was the last straw for them. It's not a good feeling to get melee'd by someone that is still too hard to see when all it takes 1-2 clicks of a mouse button to the body with no effort to kill. Based on the dev's actions, it's clear that they are casualizing the game, making it less skill based. Gamebreaking bugs since day one, no merc limits, bad business model for a f2p, and shit balance updates are just a few of the many issues this game suffers from. I can go on for hours about how this game could had been so much more but it's never going to happen because these devs simply are just incompetent. I really wonder if they even play their own game.
Dirty Bomb is a fast paced shooter with parkour elements and great gunplay with large, multiple objective maps.

For each match you build a squad of 3 mercenaries ("mercs") you can switch to with each respawn cycles. This gives you a lot of variety in how you approach certain situations and which role to take in the team. Although each merc can perform any action the game requires, different mercs excel at certain tasks: medics can revive downed players quickly, engineers can repair, plant and defuse faster and combat mercs have "bigger" guns and more health. However, every merc is fully capable of winning a fire fight, so there's no need for medics to camp it out in the back.

Every merc has a special ability like throwing health packages, calling in devastating air strikes, putting down mines or throwing grenades. Timing the abilities right is essential for winning a match.

The free to play model is very fair. You start out with 2 decent mercs and there are 3 more free mercs on rotation every week so you can try them out and always have a roster that covers every angle. The game also has a loadout system where different weapons and perks can support your play style better. The standard loadouts are usually quite good already and enough to get you going without any disadvantage.

To get more mercs and loadouts you can either buy them in the shop for money or with in-game credits. The fastest way to get credits is by playing missions that are updated every 3 hours and can typically be done within about an hour (or even faster if you are more skilled). If you play 2 mission cycles a day, you should be able to buy a new merc about every 20 hours of playtime.

Loadouts can be obtained in various styles and although they look different the most expensive ones are no better than the cheapest. If you ever stumble across Angry Joe's review of Dirty Bomb you can safely ignore it because the system has changed since then. It wasn't pay to win even back then, Angry Joe simply didn't grasp how it works.

Every now and then there are events where you can get special looking loadouts, for example Christmas style. The events can be frustrating because there is no way to get exactly the loadout you want. Instead you have to pray to RNGesus to drop your favourite. If you don't want to spend any money on the events, you typically get only a few drops and rarely one you actually like. This system is somewhat understandable though because it encourages you (but does not force you) to spend money. It's kind of hard to suggest something that would work better and still let developers eat.

The graphics have a quite distinct visual style with plenty of yellow. The mercs use a comic look and have plenty of amusing one liners. Some of them they utter automatically, others can be issued using voice commands. Some of the taunts are downright hilarious.

The audio is solid and very important gameplay wise. Apart from hearing the direction of shots, there are many audible clues that tell you what is going on. Team mates screaming in pain might need a health pack, C4 getting planted or defused might need you attention and incoming air strikes hint at taking cover. There are also many visual clues like an imminent orbital laser getting focus on the ground. Watching and listening to your  surroundings is essential for a low respawn rate.

Respawn happen in cycles every 25 seconds. This allows to some extend predict where enemies will be and what they are about to do. This is also the base for several advanced tactics. For example it is beneficial to kill an enemy a few seconds after a new spawn cycle started so he's out of the game for more than 20 seconds ("long spawn"). Likewise it can be useful to suicide in a hopeless situation towards they end of a spawn cycle so you can respawn together with your team mates at full health and ammo ("k out"). 

Being successful at Dirty Bomb requires team work. It's quite common for a winning team to have two medics, one or two mercs focusing on combat and the rest being an engineer, ammunition support or something situational. There are times where it is helpful to deviate from this  formula to focus on offence or defence for a few spawn cycles but in general you want to have all the roles filled.

All this can result in fun games with glorious teamwork and plenty of intense moments, making Dirty Bomb a unique shooter that stands out from the crowd and providing a kind of experience currently no other game can deliver.

Alas, it rarely does.

Most of the time, Dirty Bomb is a clueless and messy crapfest where players try to outdo each
other in ignorance and incompetence.

There's several reasons for that:

1. Inexperienced players naturally do not know what to do and still learn the game. That's ok and it's quite rare to see experienced players be mean to them. However, the game does not make itself easy to learn. There are tutorials to explain the parkour movements and how to drop ammo but apart from that you can only learn by doing, watching others or spend hours on YouTube to wade through tutorials of various degrees of helpfulness. Sadly the game does not offer any mode where new players could get the hang of it. Instead they commonly lumped together with players well past 1000 hours of experience, resulting in a match that is not fun for either.

2. Ignorant players do not care if their merc benefits the team. It's quite common to have teams with 2 or more snipers but no medics. Asking them to switch to other mercs rarely helps. The net result typically is a toxic atmosphere, a boring match and wasted time. The community has been asking for a "one merc" rule for ages but the developers do not seem to care.

3. Abysmal match making with insane skill spread. While match making with a small player base is challenging there is no excuse for it being as bad as Dirty Bomb. The team mechanic of taking different roles would allow for interesting algorithms that tell you your recommended role before the match and judge your individual performance afterwards. Instead, match making seems to use a simple Elo rating as foundation and increases or decreased it on winning or losing a match. While it attempts to match players with a similar rating, it gives up pretty quickly and it's quite common to have both unranked and Gold or even Elite ranked players in the same match. The match result is random and independent of your skill and contribution.

4. Badly designed mercs. There is a whole class of mercs called "recons" that consists of snipers and Phantom, an attempt to bring Team Fortress 2's Spy to Dirty Bomb. None of these mercs add anything of value to a game with fast gunplay and teamwork as its foundation. Also they are hard to play and only make sense once you mastered the game to a certain degree by playing other mercs. Nevertheless you can start sniping at level 1 and remain sniper for the entire match.

5. Lack of focus in merc design. Initially, mercs were about guns, healing and ammunition. Then explosives were added. Tweaking cooldowns and explosive ranges eventually managed to bring the game back on track of being a fun shooter. Then flashbangs and EMP grenades kept you from doing what you wanted to do, which was running around shooting and healing. Then more mercs with explosive were added, with the rocket launcher wielding Javelin picking the top spot of combining lack of skill with cheap kills. So mercs with shield abilities were added. Which turned a fast paced shooter with great gun play into spamming explosives and stun grenades and waiting for shield cooldowns to expire.

By now it's doubtful that even if Splash Damage gets their act together Dirty Bomb will ever become the game it  once aspired to be.
Okay I used to love this game, but Splash Damage does so many things wrong, I just had to uninstall at this point. Splash Damage just doesn't have a clue, what they wanna do with this game. 

First they tried to be a competitive easy to learn hard to master game. Something everyone would have appreciated and loved. I am just not quite sure if they know what it means to be competitive focused. 

I have no idea who has those balance ideas, but that guy clearly needs to be replaced. If someone wants to tell me they listen to the community, it clearly is the wrong side of the community. Skins and events are nice and prob important to make any revenue, but nobody I know really wants them. We want balancing and bug fixes. There is no point in selling skins if there is no player base.

And if SD decides to make a balance updates, you just ask yourself while reading through the notes:"wait wut? Who complained about this?". They recently tried to balance shotgun, sniper and burst weapons. Well, I can't say they didn't sledgehammer 2/3 of them. I can't deny that all 3 of these weapon types needed a balance in some way. I can however deny that these changes make the game more balanced.

Sniping just transformed to a defensive camping playstyle otherwise you will lose no matter what. There is no reason to play sniper anymore, I mean any auto assault rifle can do the same just better and faster. They could give snipers a faster instagib again, making playing sniper again worth it in some way.

Burst fire got a huge hit, but I mean it was clearly broken. In close and medium range it is still good but you can't snipe anymore. Thank you SD

Shotgun got no changes from my view, it is even more broken if you can aim a bit.

So now the point is: Assault rifles like Timik, M4 and hochfir are so much better in any aspect, there is literally no reason to play anything besides them. If you can't aim just go for shotgun and you will get some kills in no time. You can't even aim a little bit? No worries Proxy with any shotgun and the perk "lock on" is the merc to go with. 

This game still has a huge potential, the question is: Will it ever reach it? The player base is clearly dying everyday a new player appears, 2 veterans disappear. 

EDIT 18.01.18: Nothing changed yet, so I'll just edit this review every time SD released or is about to release an update.
[h1]Meet Clean Bomb, Casual to the core. Impossible to Pick Up, Easy to Master.[/h1]

I shouldn't be here not recommending this, it's a good game that used to be dragged down by bad and safe decisions, useless publishers (Nexon), terrible marketing choices, and a community full of yes-men and shills. Now it's dragged down by SD's faith in their economic system, balancing graphs and steam reviews (ironically).

Let's talk about the community first, shall we?

[u][b]1: The community.[/b][/u]

The in-game community in this game is... not what you'd expect from a f2p actually, from what i've experienced of it, it's good, i've had my fair share of laughs and good moments on it, there's always your average 9 year old being a d*ck in your game, but it's okay otherwise, i've had loads of fun talking to pepole in game, whenever i was new or considered a "veteran" as of right now.

The vocal minority (i.e the 1% on the forums and reedit) is pretty much what used to rule SD through feedback, and for the most part, not for the best, suggesting that X character was perfectly okay despite the fact that it used to be completely banned in tournaments and ruled over the meta and team compositions for sometimes months and at worst,years (Oldies will remember the mess that was Thunder, to cite an example). Anyone who used to go against the bandwagon was massively downvoted, and i'f it was aggresively worded enough, would warrant you a mass flagging on the forums and most likely a ban wherever your concerns are backed by solid evidence/arguments or not. I would know, since i used to be part of the Kool Kids Klub on the forums and have tried that and witnessed pepole get a ban for it. Stay away from their echo chamber i'f you want to make a change on DB, do in depth reviews on Steam instead, there is a reason why they barely look there anymore.

The community landscape might change though, seeing that they recently announced that they want to cater to the[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatPumpkinDick/recommended/730/] CS:GO/Mobile gaming communities.[/url] (More on that later)

Now's a good time to give a little backstory to "Clean Bomb", shall we?

[u][b]2: From Dirty and Competitive to Clean and Casual.[/b][/u]

It's been a good while since this game stopped being what it says it is. From a gameplay standpoint to it's business model.

I'll start with it's business model and say that it went from poorly made back in Nexon's days to shamelessly cash grabby with SD in full control.

I got three (technically six, but whatever) rhetorical questions to 2015-2016 vets looking at this review:

-Have you asked for fun and rewarding events that still rewards daily grinding well? Or have you asked for copy-paste, cash grabby, grind heavy, RNG heavy, disappointing events sh.at out every month?

-Have you asked for good mercs with interesting gimmicks, that rewards talent and dedication to it?
Carefully planned and well polished merc balancing?
Or have you asked for the [url=http://forums.dirtybomb.com/discussion/37672/dirty-wars-1-the-javelin-menace/p1]abomination that was Javelin[/url] on it's first week, an engineer better at killing than mercs dedicated only to do that (fletcher), and new garbage mercs that don't belong in DB (Turtle,Guardian), all balanced by a graph system?

(Fun drinking game: Drink a shot everytime that pepole said nonsensical arguements to deflect the fact that rockets used to be able to insta-down Rhinos in under half a second to defend SD and get upvotes for it)

-Have you asked a fundemental rework on how loadout cards work, a reduction in the RNG involved in getting special editions, granting them possibly more loyality, less player frustration and more money?
Or have you asked for basically the same loadout system, but with CS:GO's weapon lootcrates pi$$ed all over it for Chirstmas?

I'f you can see the link between those three questions without even answering it, good on you, you now know that they want your money at all costs with no regard to the competitiveness of their game. Enough said.

[b][u]3: "teh gaemz fast paced n competitive exxxxdddd". [/u][/b]

A quick note before i get into that, at the time i'm writing this,the loadout system isn't p2w, since all cards beyond bronze all have the same augments (insignificant bonuses that make your merc slightly better at one niche in particular) and weapons for a very cheap price, meaning that (theorically) you quickly are on an equal footing with vets. 

Now onto the subject at hand...

It used to be a joke, since anything with insane amounts of frontloaded damage and a decent RoF becomes a god-Slaying machine in this game (i,e pre-nerf burst-rifles,semi autos,shotguns and snipers), but thanks to recent weapon changes, all of the weapon categories i have mentionned above has been nerfed into a black hole,making them either incredbly reliant on RNG or/and trying to push too hard some niches in which they were supposed to shine in the first place, making them underpowered to useless in what they were supposed to do (ironically) and just unfun.

...Or it also made them accidentally better at clicking heads than snipers. (Hello 12 pellet sniper rifle!) 

The game also wants itself to be fast paced, but does it the same way a drunk guy at the verge of passing out would: it could be fast, it's just drunk enough to not be sure about it.

Thanks to an abysmal lack of much needed merc reworks, you get a nice parkour system and great gunplay dragged down by near instant "i win duels" buttons and instant area denial buttons.
Having fun roaming around the map picking kills with squishy characters? Lol skrub, get insta sticky bombed, thinking you're safe and that this duel you're having is pretty much won fair and square and just wanna escape? NOPE, get concussed and dead. Think that all this time you spent mastering Airstrike markers, and artillery shots was worth it? That all this time spent training with Fragger helped you growing as a top assault main and made you better at aiming? Boom, Javelin,Stoker and Guardian. In just one click, they have rendered everything you have worked for obsolete.

Ranked in DB mainly just counts your Defeat/Victory ratio, doesn't account player performance and pits you and your team against pepole with twice the amount of experience and playtime. On any FPS. [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quatzel/recommended/333930/]This review explains things better than i would. [/url]
Stay away from it for your own sake, grinding ranked skins bring you nothing special anyways besides a little paint over your guns and merc. It's just considered a meme and servers where suicidal pepole meet.

This is why i call Dirty Bomb "Clean Bomb", because when SD took over their game and tried to clean their rep, they also (accidentally?) wiped off the identity of their game and tried to draw Overwatch's sh.i.tty unessecary RPS meta and CS:GO's economical model over it. With a black CD marker. BADLY. It's just safe choices nowadays.

Sadly enough, SD thinks that trying to rip off what works in other games gives them an identity and more money.
It doesn't, back in the day, i would've said that DB tried to be different. Not anymore.

New players, avoid this game, the only veterans you'll see nowadays are just die-hard fans that are too nostalgic to give up on this game.

[b]TL:I Can Barely Read: I'f they stopped trying too hard to live in your wallet, this game wouldn't be just barely floating.
They wouldn't put fu*king weapon skin lootboxes the same way Nexon would have done it. They shouldn't pander to cs:go's gambling addicts, AND MERC BALANCE WOULDN'T BE SO F*CKING RANDOM.[/b]
Now, where to begin..

Let me start with saying I enjoyed this game most times I played it.
I am a decent player, played a game prior to this with almost the same game mechanics for a decade (RtCW). I have played PUGs and competed in a few competitive tournaments this game had.
That being said, I think I reached a point where I no longer am able to enjoy this game, and it all has to do with SD's (game developers) incompetence.

Since I have 0 interest in typing a massive essay, ill try to keep it to a relatively short summary.

Almost every big update SD shipped was a slap in the face for the average experienced, not braindead player. Dirty Bomb is a first person shooter, but it qualifies more as a Fighting/Melee game.
Playing Super Smash Brothers against the computer is more of a challenge than running around as a Phantom with its latest update (27-02-18) 

Phantom was introduced to this skillbased first person shooter on July 7th 2015. A merc which could go completely invisible. Have a new melee weapon (Katana) which deals a massive 104 damage (with Chopper,an augment on your card) with its heavy attack. And you would hardly hear him.

Obviously this merc was met with large amount of negative feedback from the playerbase. Which made them tone him down and actually make him balanced. Still, he would never be picked in higher skilled ranked games or PUGs.

But the casual player base that loves to swing their Katana around in this skillbased first person shooter were mad, they had no idea how to play Phantom anymore, cause he wasn't invisible enough anymore to just run around as a retard (excuse my language) and you would actually need a functional brain to play him now. 

I actually played him in pubs when I was bored and wanted a change, he could still get behind enemy lines and suprise enemies if you actually have the slightest of idea of what you are doing, and you would actually use your gun instead of running around with your Katana 24/7.

But no. Dirty Bombs player base, which for 80%+ consists out of casual players that want 0 challenge and just left click and be able to kill one without even having to move their mouse, screamed murder and unfortunately, SD 
collapsed under the pressure and re-made Phantom.

Phantom might not be as big of a shitshow as he was on inital release. But it's not far from it.

[url=https://youtu.be/hRSXeyYxQE8] Here is a small clip of today's update. [/url] You clearly see a enemy Phantom, I move away from him, even prefire to try to avoid him jumping me, but it's all in vain. As he just runs up to me and with a click of a button deletes me. Did you hear the audio cue of Phantom cloaking and approaching? Yeh, me neither.

Dirty Bomb does not have a big playerbase. It has a fair amount of new players trying the game out, but it's player retention is terrible. It still gets quite some unique players per week. But hardly had more than 2000 players playing it at the same time at its daily peek in the last couple of months. Which is fine for a game in Beta. Sure, Ranked is more dead than alive, and pubs are mostly a stomp. But its unique playstyle is what kept me playing.

But no more, with every update they are making this game more casual friendly. Which makes one of the main quotes of the game quite a joke

[quote=SD / Dirty Bomb] Dirty Bomb takes first person shooters back to their purest roots in a fast-paced team game that will challenge even the most competent players. This game won‚Äôt hold your hand, in fact it is more likely to kick your teeth in. With no controller support or aim assist, all that lies between you and certain death is player skill and reaction.	[/quote]

More likely to kick my teeth in? You mean get analy probed by a Phantoms Katana that just got behind me with no indication of him getting there.

Thanks for the fun, but I had enough. 


Are you new to first person shooters and don't wanna put much effort in learning a game and want to get kills straight away? Dirty Bomb is right up your alley.

Do you have basic knowledge of how to aim your mouse and want to play a skill based first person shooter? Move along, im afraid Dirty Bomb has nothing to do with that anymore.
This game had a brilliant future destroyed by the lack of communication between devs and community, zero f given towards players' feedback. Typical casual free to play game with no competitive sense and scene. I loved this game.
[h1]Dirty Bomb is...[/h1]
Probably the most dissapointing game currently on Steam.
It gives me great displeasure to give this game a negative review, but the current state of the game is deserving of it. Dirty Bomb is, at its core, one of the most compelling shooters on the market, as its base gunplay is both skillful and satisfying. 

There are a great number of players that have sunk thousands of hours into this game, attempting to become as good a player as the game will allow, and yet in recent times these players have left the game en mass, despite the promise of an upcoming launch almost 3 years since entering open beta. The reason, a consistent decline in the quality of the game, and by extension its enjoyability. Issues that have been present in the game for years, such as the notorious bugginess of the EV's collision detection with players, remain unresolved. 

Characters that destroy the skillful aspects of the game are not only remaining unchanged after extensive negative feedback from the hardcore community, but are being added to the game for no reason other than to give the less skilled players a way to compete with those same players that have invested time into the game, learning the mechanics and trainging their aim. Examples include the abilities of mercs such as Proxy and Javelin, which both allow a player to output enough damage in an instant to kill any player in the game, with little to no telegraphing. 

The shotguns within the game are far more powerful than they should be, requiring little effort to output extreme amounts of damage, and with the relatively recent buffs to the ranged effectiveness are simply far too strong when compared to the other weapons of the game, and often leave players feeling as though there was no way to retaliate. Automatic weapons such as the Assult Rifles and SMGs require a player to track the opponent, compensate for recoil and land as many headshots as possible to be effective, whereas shotguns merely require a player to aim centre mass and pull the trigger.

When I initally saw the steam page for DB pop up on the featured store page, I saw a game that told me it would satisfy my want of a skill based competitive shooter, with a low skill floor and high skill ceiling. A game that would be challenging to be good at. But sadly the game has trended toward the casual audience, preying on those willing to put up money for a few flashy skins (which aren't even particularly good when compared to the litteral artwork displayed in games such as CSGO), and rewarding them with the ability to compete with players of any skill level with skilless tactics such as mine shooting.

On the Australian servers at very least, its becoming increasingly infrequent to spot players with any meaningful amount of time invested in the game, the vast majority falling under lvl 20, as those that wanted DB to succeed the most give up on the game, seening that Splash Damage ignores their feedback and is unwillling to develop the game in the areas that would make it good. 

There technically is still the opportunity for the game to become one of the greatest shooters of the decade, if not all time, with massive Esports potential. However, it seems as though this will not be the case, as the developers attempt to squeeze the remaining pennies out of the quickly shrinking playerbase before their inevitable failure of  a full release/launch. Having spent around $100 on this game after SD's seperation from Nexon in an attempt to support positive development of the game, I can say that I honestly couldn't regret the decision more.

Don't give this game your time, and certainly not your money, go buy yourself a nice meal, you'll get far more enjoyment out of it.
It really is sad for me to say I wouldnt recommend this game it has great movement and gunplay which ruin other shooters for you and it is honestly really fun but they have consistently screwed up with their decisions while making this game 
whether it is the nightmare that was the phantom rework or the actually not better mission system revamp (psst you dont get more credits) or the many many many things they told us were coming like custom loadouts or weapon skin polishing that got scrapped with them never telling us publicly  
hell we have been told the ev would take far too long to fix so it never is gonna happen which it is honestly a nightmare to escort as is... everything is sadly too much work‚Ñ¢ for them to do as they have said  and will proabably continue to be 

all in all it is a great game  but once the omg this is so cool factor runs out you notice all the glaring things wrong with the game and it starts to eat your soul since you realize that no other shooter will be able to please you again 
6/10 actually fix shotgun headshot multiplier
I was a dedicated player of this game for over 2 years, in total I have put nearly 2,000 hours into it and over $200 spent on it.  At it's core it is one of the best games I have ever played, but instead of expanding on the rewarding and unique aspects of the game, the developers instead turned around "competitive to the core" and are focusing on a more bland, casual and overall unrewarding gameplay design.  Horrible balance, weak and uninspired character design, and a distinct lack of passion for the game are what Dirty Bomb has turned into in the past few months, perhaps even the past year.  

They refuse to listen to criticism, whether it's fair and constructive or harsh and hateful they lump it all in one bin and will often times mute, kick, or outright ban their critics from social media platforms, OR find excuses to ban them from the game entirely.  The developers do not care about their dedicated playerbase, and have claimed themselves that they are gearing the game towards drawing in a new audience, while refusing to do anything to reward those who actually stay with the game. 

In addition, this game is filled with cheaters, both aimbot, wallhacks and those who throw or boost in ranked matches.  Yet players who have toxic attitudes-cursing in chat, calling names, and displaying poor opinions of the game are deemed more ban worthy than those who outright cheat.  Skilled players who can NOT find matches because of the horrible matchmaking system and must turn to alt accounts are punished, and SD devs would rather force their playerbase to sit into ranked queues that last an hour and a half on slow times, and no less than 45 minutes at peak play time...And then still be matched with bottom tiering players.  

If you're looking for a quick game to pick up while you're bored, Dirty Bomb will do just fine.  But if you're looking for a unique, rewarding, and FUN experience...keep looking. 


Out of touch devs, balance and content updates that are detrimental to the success of the game with major bugs and glitches that are rarely fixed, let alone fixed quickly. 

Little to no support for competitive, the ranked game mode is very underpopulated with queue times well over 20 minutes. On top of that it just plays out like a casual public game with singular merc spam (i.e 2 auras + 2 fraggers). The competitive scene, if you could even call it that, is pretty much barren, with only two 3rd party organisations hosting tournaments that do not have consistent sign ups with pretty much worthless prizes.

The Anti Cheat system is very lacking, well known togglers remain unbanned after months of constant play whereas legitimate top players have been banned on multiple occasions due to flaws in the system. 

If you're looking for a skill based game where the better player wins, look elsewhere, Dirty Bomb is headed towards a casual cesspool of instant kill abilities and RNG weapons.
[b] No [/b]

edit: The game was fun at first and despite relatively low player numbers, the mechanics were enough to keep me interested throughout 2016. There were plenty of tournaments and PUGs and all was fine. It was a a shooter that focused mostly on tracking and positioning. I even managed to nab a tournament win with an all American team.

When I last played the game in October 2017, the game was already on a crash course to mediocre-ville. It was trying to ape other popular games with its increasingly rock-paper-scissors & one button win mercs. While this may have grabbed some attention at first, ultimately it is failing as there are superior games with that type of gameplay. And based on what I'm hearing, it's not getting any better half a year later since I left.

I will thank Dirty Bomb for all the cool people that I've met and the fun games I've played. We're still playing together in other places. But with many promised features still not implemented like private dedicated servers and the game veering off into a drastically different direction, it's really not clicking with me anymore.

Best of luck in the future as you try to work out what went wrong.

[strike]Dirty Bomb is quite an anomaly in the F2P arena. It has solid mechanics and base gameplay. Everything is accessible to everyone. You do have to have to buy new characters to use and loadouts (which vary up the weapon selection and minor perks), but the time it takes seems fair. There are plenty of missions that rotate every three hours and daily bonuses that allow you to rack up 1000s of credits every day in addition to receiving credits for just playing. A new merc will take you about 1-2 weeks to unlock if you time your missions right.  If you don't want to use in-game credits for this, there is the option to spend real world money. This does seem a bit high for what you get though and I recommend getting the bundle when it goes on sale. You're not at a loss for choice though at the start. You get Aura (a medic) and Skyhammer (a fire support class / jack of all trades type) permanently for free in addition to three rotating mercs that are freely available and change up every few weeks.

The feel of the game is quite smooth. There are plenty of trickjumps and shortcuts to find on the various maps. Just about every weapon is hitscan. This means that damage is dealt directly to whatever it is you click on. You can generally take several shots before dying and with a medic nearby to revive you, you're never too long removed from the action. It's similar in several ways to Enemy Territory, another free game released a decade ago by the same team, that was hugely popular as well as TF2. There are similar classes that you can choose from. Medics revive and heal. Assault dishes out damage as well as taking it. Fire support provides your team with ammo and helps destroy objectives and whole teams from afar. Engineers repair much faster as well as planting/defusing bombs. And Recon helps your team with map awareness and picking off enemies from a distance. Lots of basic functionality is shared across the classes and there's plenty of combinations to choose from if you're looking for something that'll fit your playstyle. 

Finally, the community itself is fairly laid-back and welcoming. Especially compared with other FPSes I've played. And I've been playing since the 90s. This is likely a result of how small it is. There's something like 3-4k players on typically. Just enough to have a decent selection of servers across multiple maps and game modes. In addition to there being pick-up games you can find being formed across the many community voice servers if you're looking for more of a challenge.

There is some hitching with certain combinations of hardware and software. It's recommended that you get a CPU that is very powerful on one core at least. The latest quad-core from Intel overclocked a decent amount should allow consistent 144 fps and up. A mid-range GPU should suffice. I can personally run this at 1440p @ 144hz on a 4930k @ 4.3ghz and a 7970 ghz Edition @ 1165 Core / 1575 Memory. I generally get up to 200fps with this setup and the GPU runs at about 40-60% usage.

This is probably among the better deals in not only F2P games, but more expensive ones as well. TF2 players will love it for the similarly fast paced action and the different classes provided. CS:GO players will enjoy the small teams and similar weaponry that they are already used to. Not to mention the greatly reduced recoil. While alternatives exist in the rapidly expanding genre of class-based shooters, Dirty Bomb has that perfect fit of fast action and teamplay that I find lacking elsewhere.

tl;dr

Solid shooter, no power advantages via cash like in other F2P shooters, great community. Oh, did I mention it's free?[/strike]
It's a shame that Splash Damage stopped developing this honestly. In this state I really can't recommend it and with no more content to come it's hard to justify the time investment for a game like this.
Splash Damage is no longer actively developing or updating its free-to-play online shooter ‚ÄúDirty Bomb,‚Äù it announced on the game‚Äôs official website Thursday.

PVP only and no one is playing so not even worth downloading for free.

The game is totally dead as you can see in this video from the "Death of a Game" series. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORf1dIgbXTY&t=1979s

The video does a good job of explaining a lot of the problems (pay-to-win, broken market that won't let you buy only what you want, hacker-infestation etc.) but something the video won't mention is that the community manager is a politically motivated troll who lets people in the discussions introduce politics and personal abuse and then bans people who tell them to stick to gaming as you can see from the discussion below. 

https://steamcommunity.com/app/333930/discussions/0/1798529872638152137/

I myself was perma-banned for telling someone who was whinging that "gender neutral bathrooms" were what killed Lawbreakers to shut up about politics.

PVP-only games ALWAYS dies unless they are super popular. This game is just another corpse on the pile (the corrupt, biased, community manager is just an afterthought to that inevitable failure.)

Other minor note, you can't even get Steam playing cards for running the game anymore even though these are advertised on the store page.

Even the technical support page takes you to an error message saying that the page no longer exists.

This game doesn't even work anymore. It should be taken down from steam.
