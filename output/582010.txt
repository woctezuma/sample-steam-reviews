If you ever get bored of the end-game grind, here's a small list of things to do that may make you feel a little happy.

1. Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.

2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. 

3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. 

4. The obvious, "do all the quests." Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. 

5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. 

That's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. 
Maybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred. Anything and everything you can do to help your end-game grind, find it!
TL;DR: this is how you fix a title from an imperfect launch. Good dev response, important features added. Capcom cares.

Probably the biggest recovery from launch of any game, ever. Excellent fixes, great work from the developers and community managers - little to no BS, mouse fixes, network fixes, prolonged events, and continued support for those with continued network issues. While a clumsy launch is always best to avoid, the gameplay and response from Capcom to the issues they've caused has been more than acceptable. These guys care about making a good game into a great one.
( Not a Review )

PSA: Turn off Volumetric Rendering to significantly boost your FPS.

EDIT: Just updating this for the Steam Game Awards. It's my nomination for GOTY.
For MHW veterans on consoles: This version has faster loading times compared to the consoles, you will be impressed.
For newcomers: BEWARE. It still has some issues that I will explain in a moment.

This review was specifically made for those who have a low-end PC. I want to share my actual specs and current graphic setting to try and reach 1080p 60fps.

MY BUILD 

CPU: AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00GHz
Video Card: AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 4GB VRAM
RAM: 12 GB
Storage: Hybrid HD-SSD

As you can tell, it's not impressive, something Low-Mid for today standards.

GRAPHIC SETTINGS IN MONSTER HUNTER WORLD

Frame Rate (cap): 60.

V-Sync: Off. 
I rather tweak some settings with my Radeon software to try and fix the V-Sync, so I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far. The thing is, the built-in V-Sync in the game is very taxing. 
FPS cost: HIGH

Resolution Scaling: Low. 
The difference is noticeable between Low/Med/High, but the fps jump is kinda noticeable as well, specially in open areas (which is VERY common in the game). Since I'm playing on a 49" HDTV from a distance I can't tell much of a difference, so I leave it in Low. 
FPS cost: LOW.

Texture Quality: 1024. 
Tested on lower values but hardly see any difference... until cutscenes showed up. Close ups also shows the degraded quality on textures, fortunately FPS is stable at max. 
FPS cost: VERY LOW.

Ambient Occlussion: Off. 
Adds more detail on the environment, but I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on low. 
FPS cost: MEDIUM

Volume Rendering Quality: Off. 
This is it, the bane of the FPS. Console users will recognize it as the fog, the one to blame all those fps drops; it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuff, but you can't see past the fog sometimes. This is no Nintendo 64, so no need to leave it on. 
FPS Cost: EXTREMELY HIGH.

Shadow Quality: Low. 
The shadows in the game are already good; sure you will see some low quality shadows cast from the characters, but it definitely won't bother you, also you will save a lot of FPS. 
FPS cost: HIGH

Anti-Aliasing: Off. 
I personally override the settings with Radeon settings, I use AMD's AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settings, which makes blurry edges, specially FXAA. Jaggies can be seen, but doesn't bother me that much. 
FPS Cost: MEDIUM

LOD Bias: Low. 
This defines how detailed the objects are from a distance. I generally switch between low and medium, but the drop in FPS is kinda noticeable.
FPS cost: MEDIUM.

Max LOD Level: No Limit. 
Will switch between -1 and No Limit, but it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimes, so I leave it in No Limit, also, it doesn't punish my FPS that hard.
FPS cost: LOW.

Foliage Sway: On. 
I want the game to look good and alive. Static foliage is not good, nor alive.
FPS cost: VERY LOW.

Subsurface Scattering: On.
I like to see very detailed skin on characters, definitely looks bad without it, specially in cutscenes.
FPS cost: LOW 

Screen Space Reflection: Off.
How objects reflect the environment. FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.
FPS cost: MEDIUM

Anisotropic Filtering: Off.
The detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.
FPS cost: MEDIUM

Water Reflection: On.
I honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.
FPS cost: LOW

SH Diffuse Quality: Low.
There is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.
FPS cost: MEDIUM 

Dynamic Range: 64-Bit. 
Left on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.
FPS: LOW

Z-Prepass: On.
I honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.
FPS cost: LOW


After all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.

Had already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.

The game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.
Character customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)
You have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.
It has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.
It has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.
It has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.
You have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.
There's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. 
You can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say "finish", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.

Now, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. 
Disconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.

You will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.

Some users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.

Some users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.
Speaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.

Graphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.
If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.
If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.

Better yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.

So, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better.
[h1]First Monster Hunter[/h1]
Ive been waiting for something like this for a long time. This game has single handily murdered my RL commitments within its first 2 weeks of being out. This review may be geared more toward newcomers such as myself. It has some issues Ill get into, but I'm also gonna explain what it is, and why it’s so damn fun. 

So wtf is it then? In a nut shell, there are 5 big open worlds/maps. These maps have huge monsters that you have to track down, kill, and harvest their glorious innards. You yourself do not level up. You’ll pick from 1 of 14 weapons (which is like your class, and you can switch em out as well if you wanna try others) and craft better weapons and armor from the parts you farm from monsters. You have a central hub (Astera) you’ll probably spend a lot of your time in, running side missions, while also progressing through the story and unlocking new maps, monsters, and adding/upgrading beneficial NPC hubs  within Astera. There’s so much content in this game it’s ridiculous. 

Things will start out slow, confusing and pretty damn difficult. You’ll prob have to google some sh*t and some of the fights, especially your first time going in, can last up to 30 minutes. You’ll have to learn the fights, learn the environments, learn your weapon, and learn what items you’ll need to bring. You craft almost everything in the game, from the coatings on your arrows, food, traps, to different potions for different situations. Everything is harvestable from the world; plants, nuts, animals, bugs, fishing, etc.
As you progress through the story you’ll go up in Hunter Rank. The story itself is pretty much one long tutorial and as you complete story missions your Hunter Rank goes up, allowing you to take on stronger monsters as you become more powerful.

You can play the entire game SP or MP. For me I would say 60-70% of my time has been spent playing with RL friends. This is were the fun and the problems come in.
As of right now MHW has a pretty bad connection problem. From what Ive read, it’s worse for people who try and run match making exclusively. Me and my friends alone, we have connection issues but it’s not nearly as bad as others are reporting. I'm not saying the problem doesn’t exist, but for us its not unplayable.   Honestly it has varied day-to-day. Some days are worse than others. When it does happen, it literally take 5-10 seconds to reconnect. Sh*t can be frustrating at times, especially mid fight, but it’s not something that's constantly happening to us.

Another thing, when you’re out on a hunt, you can send up an “SOS”. If you or someone else needs a part from a certain monster, they can respond to this sos and now you have a party of 4 going after the same target. This is the only way I play MP when not playing with friends, and again, I haven’t had a terrible experience with it. It has issues like the rest of the game’s connection issues but nothing as broken as Ive read in various forums. I have never tried to connect to match making so I cant comment on that outside what others are saying. There are currently 2 patches Capcom have been testing that are showing up in steamdb. I should also note that I usually dont play until after 7pm est.

Other user complaints have been about performance. Again, maybe I’m just lucky. There are reportedly fixes but I haven’t had to do anything. 980ti/i5 4670k/latest Nvidia driver and I’m running 50-60 fps mid-high settings @2560x1440. I do get dips in the 40s but again, nothing game breaking, not for me at least.

So thats pretty much it. Ive had a sh*t ton of fun running through the game with friends. Ive not played a good MP game in awhile and this game definitely hits the spot. There is just so much stuff to do, goals to set on what you wanna do next, helping each other out and so on. The above issues are from my personal experience and in no way am I saying those problems don’t exist. It’s a f*cking fantastic game that’s unfortunately getting review bombed due to Capcom’s slow (or almost lacking I should say) response.

[b]Connection Update[/b]
On 22 Aug, the same day I posted this review, Capcom patched the game. The patch was intended to reduce connection issues for folks while they continued to iron it out. Ive had about 30 hrs play time since, and have honestly had 0 connection issues, playing as I do, mentioned in the review. Playing with friends in our own lobbies, or running SOS missions. I have had 0 disconnects, 0 MW errors. Every single MP mission Ive started with friends or ran in SOSs since the patch has ended without a single connection drop. Some people are still reporting issues with match making or joining random lobbies. I cant comment on these issues since I dont ever join them.
Dont let the mixed overall reviews scare you, the game is very enjoyable in its current state. With the connection issues gone and several bugs fixed, it can only go upwards from here. Also, new content is added every few weeks together with events.

Overall the game is a step up from the Monster Hunter series in both graphical terms and gameplay wise.

<Comparison to previous MH titles>

- Gathering is much easier and faster
- More ways to use the environment to your advantage (dropping boulders, sliding downhill to launch an aerial attack and so on)
- A slinger which is used primarily for shooting flash bombs, sonic bombs, etc, but can also be used to travel around the environment faster (hooking onto a wingdrake for example)
- Turf wars between monsters, which can turn the hunt to your favor
- Scoutflies which lead you towards points of interest or monster traces (basically they work like a gps)
- Usage of armor skills got way easier, you shouldnt have any problems figuring them out even if this is your first MH
- Customizable cat companion, with plenty of gadgets to help you out
- Damage indicators which let you know if you are attacking a weak spot or just arent doing any damage at all
- No G-rank, this is the only downside really

TL;DR: Game is good, for both newcomers and fans of the MH franchise
Bought 2 copies (me and my brother) day one at full price, totally worth it, here's why:

- First week the game had some connectivity issues, fixed within a few days
- Performance issues after launch, fixed in a few days 
- Hundreds of hours of gameplay with the vanilla game, assuming you don't want to optimize builds for every weapon
- Did I mention that there are tons of classes?
- Constantly updating with NEW and FREE content (new monsters/weapons/armor sets)
- Replayability (is that how you spell it?) is huge, not only because every class plays differently, but also because when you start getting the hang of the most "advanced" techniques (not really that advaced) such as parries and guard point, the game becomes a whole new learning experience

Basically, this is game of the year (2018) for me, even though there were many other good games, the combination of amazing gameplay and free DLC's (which sadly are rare nowadays) need to be rewarded.
10/10 would buy again at full price.

Monster Hunter World is GOTY of 2018 for me. Here are my personal opinions on the positives and the negatives of this game.

Pros:
+ Extremely engaging hunts
+ 14 different base weapons, with tons of different variations for each from the monsters. The weapons have such satisfying impact.
+ The environments feel atmospheric, and it feels smooth to navigate through the jungles and all the other locales.
+ Unique artstyle
+ Frequent updates with festivals, collaborations (Megaman, Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy, Witcher, etc) and new monsters added, Behemoth being the last new monster to be added before the eventual Iceborne expansion.
Extremely hard versions of the already implemented monsters in the form of Arch-Tempered monsters are added for the duration of events, each offering a more powerful armor set. Also Layered armor sets.
+ Max 4 Player Co op, coop is very well implemented, save for the very janky experience if you're trying to play co-op during story missions. There are strange limitations before a friend can join, for example you have to see all the cutscenes. But most of monster hunter happens outside of story, and that's where it shines. Its just a pleasure to play with others.
+ Complex character build opportunities, you can mix different sets to get your optimal build, and you can insert jewels into slots in the armors that give you additional skills.
+ The progression feels so fulfilling, even through the 100h mark you wont feel bored.
+ You have crafting systems, before a hunt you have to eat a meal to grant you different buffs for your next hunt, you can farm ingredients, you can meld decorations (the jewels) and you can sent your Palicoes for an adventure to bring you loot.
+ Hunts have such fun hijinks, monsters disturbing your encounters with another monster, they have turf wars, and overall hunts turn into a pleasant chaos.
+ The Switchaxe
+ Great community overall, people put effort into their guild cards and most people are helpful during hunts. No real toxicity. 
+ You really shouldn't have to mention this, but yeah no microtransactions. Probably why the game feels so good in this day and age.
+Ultrawide support's here! Took a while but they did it.

Cons:
- A mediocre story.
- Annoying handler, seems to take all the glory for the hunts, even though never participating actually in any. A liability.
- Performance has been optimized imo, but still I dip occasionally below the 40fps, and one of the recent patches kinda botched the performance.
- SOS hunts tend to be a bit infuriating, because some players just are potatoes. So carts happen a bit too much at times.
- I'm not sure, but I think the game has a desire sensor. Curse it!
-  Bazelgeuse keeps popping up in all the wrong times.
- (Edit:) Co-op does suffer from a few hitches early on in the game when you're doing story missions with friends. You first have to enter the quest alone and see all the cutscenes before your friends can join in, which is just frustrating.


If this game appears in a sale or even at it's full price this game is an absolute recommend!
Monster Hunter: World is self explanatory. You hunt huge monsters. Let me first mention that I'm new to the Monster Hunter games. I was skeptical when I first bought it. I asked myself, "Is this any different from Dauntless ?", and within the first 2 hours of playing I realized it's nowhere compared to Dauntless.

Of course, it's not fair compare a free to play game with another game by a very established developer: Capcom. But I thought it would just have the core of what monster hunting should be.

I stand corrected. Monster Hunter has surprised me with the other aspects besides hunting, and the mechanics of hunting. This is truly a one-of-a-kind unique game. About 200 hours clocked in as I'm writing this review, yet I'm still not done with this game. 

Capcom is constantly pushing out new events and new monsters. They listen to the community on how the game can be improved, and they have proved themselves to be developers who care for their players. I'm only comfortable with 1 out the 14 types of weapon in the game, and I am planning to try the other weapons. 

If you're looking for a co-op where you can literally spend hours playing with your friends, this is the one to go with. It's even more fun with friends.

Get this game while its fresh !
[h1]Tips for a Zen MH Experience:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Steam > Settings > Controller > General Controller Settings > Make sure your controller type is checked off. Restart Steam.
I hear Mouse and Keyboard has some response time jank, but you should probably be playing with a controller anyway.
[*]If CPU issues, turn off volumetric fog, set FPS limit to 60. Turn off Z-Prepass, should speed up processing. 
I also have Subsurface Scattering, Screen Space Reflection, Water Reflection off. At this point my PC feels like a potato, most other settings on medium.
[*]Play in "Borderless Fullscreen Mode" as alt-tabbing out of Fullscreen will cause crashes, just save yourself the headache. Runs fine in Borderless with no issues.
[*]I have had zero issues playing with Friends. We've been using Session ID to join each other and firing SOS in story missions once they let you do that. Just takes a little verbal communication of what you're doing, use Discord. We either take turns choosing Investigations, or just elect someone party leader to choose for us.
[/list]

Makes me sad to see the reviews so Mixed, so I had to stop playing the game to write this up. Steam is for some reason incorrect, it's only logged 18.1 hours as of writing this, but my actuall game log time says 32:28:35 on main + 1:03:30 for the second character I made. (That's about how long the intro takes before you can play with friends.)

I am having a blast with this game. I didn't play other Monster Hunter games in the past, but I did play the hell out of Dragon's Dogma. A lot of these mechanics feel familiar, from the UI design to companion characters, and how bosses and elemental effects work. Supposedly World drifts from the MH forumula a tad and I guess that's right, but being like DD isn't bad either. Feels more like an RPG than a pure Boss Run game, which I prefer personally.

I'm on track to clock hundreds of hours into this game. It's all I can think about while at work or out and about. How to tackle the next monster, what gear I need to build, what materials I need to gather to prep. The environments are beautiful so far, I love the monster variety. I love the way they fight over territory. I love the amount of weapon variety, there's all types for every kind of player. I really think it's worth a buy. 

My only con is that cosmetically I have little choice of my armor selection, as skills/talents are tied to specific peices of gear. So you end up looking like a mishmash clown. I am hoping they add more layered outfit choices (all that's available currently is the Samurai outfit), because they aren't seeming like they're going to implement cosmetic item slots or let you dye the regular armor types, unfortunately. But even then, I am too distracted by what the monster is doing to worry about what I look like most of the time.
Simply put, if you like the essence of grinding, then, you'll love the game in general. If you are only here to finish the story, then, it can be achieved without much grinding but keep in mind that, the story of Monster Hunter World is there only for the sake of being there; it's nothing extraordinary & shouldn't be your only reason to buy the game. That being said, grind is a must if you want to venture beyond the story & lust for some of the best gears & late monsters in the game.

Now, the core strength of this game undoubtedly lies in the various monsters that lurks around the world. Monsters are effing brutal, each with their own distinct characteristics & abilities. Each & every of them feels like a boss fight. Preapre to spend good 10-15 mins(or even more) to take down a monster as they are quite tanky but the pleasure of besting them surely feels incredible.

Apart from the monsters, the gameplay mechanic is solid as rock, coupled with the gorgeous ambience. The game sounds good, looks better, plays best. Total of 14 different types of weapons with skillsets, playstyles & combos that's unique from one another. Freaking tons of badass looking armors, deep customization system & crafting options are at your disposal to make your life easy when you take on those mystical creatures of doom.

If you want to solo only, albeit surely possible, it may get a bit difficult or tedious. Best played with mates of course, and, the multiplayer system is being implemented in such a fluid way that you can join others(& vice versa) very easily without any hassle.
No server issues anymore as well.

Only gripe that I have is that joining the story quest in multiplayer isn't as seamless as joining those optional quests. I had to reach a certain point(cutscenes) of every story related missions & only after that my friends could join which made my experience a bit disjointed. Also, some quests where I had to search for monster tracks felt really exhausting & monotonous beacuse I had to return to hub & come again repeatedly to search for it to fill the bar.

So, overall, I would recommend this game if grinding is your cup of tea as you'll be battling with the same monsters again & again for those exotic loots. If not, I would still recommend it to buy with your friends to experience some epic monster fights in co op, but, on sale.
What a MASSIVE change to the Monster Hunter formula. Anybody who is a long time MH player will immediately notice how everything is more convenient. Whetstone is now an infinite use item that's always in your inventory, so no need to buy or collect them. No need for bug nets anymore either, since you actually collect visible bugs now. Pickaxes, those are gone too. Just get your ore and move on. No more having to paintball monsters to track them. Now there's a new system of tracking through footprints and leavings. As for hot drinks and cool drinks, cool drinks are only needed in very specific situations. Not for an entire zone. And hot drinks, I don't think they're even in the game anymore. 

Hell, there's even fast travel now. Now that's an aspect of "modernization" in game design that I can get behind. 

This is absolutely a reboot for the series. There's so much improved here from the old games that I would have a really hard time going back. Monster Hunter World is the new formula, and I hope it's here to stay.
Fun game you enjoy fighting big monsters or boss like battles, it also has 4 player Coop support

The first two hours of the game are mostly tutorials and character customization so I would reccomend looking at Youtube reviews so you know what you're geting into.

Also turn off Volumetric Rendering to significantly boost your FPS if you seem to have trouble running the game.

[Update/Response to current steam reviews]

I see a ton of people negatively reviewing the game on technical issues, acting as if the game is bad or unplayable yet still playing it for several hours.

There is currently an issue with playing on Mouse and Keyboard because the game emulates a joystick instead of using raw input from your mouse. Capcom has addressed this issue and stated that they are working on a patch to fix it. 

(Currently there is a partial fix though f you go to steam/steamapps/common/monster hunter world/ open the config file there's a setting that says MouseBaseSpeed=2.000000. Change this number so that max feels quicker Example number .2)

Also I have noticed that a lot of the negative reviews are mostly about technical issues such as there is a lack of DoF slider, or that you can't disable motion blur (turn off AA and it will go away).

The multiplayer issues have died down and the game is stable now and receving monthly updates!
I have always been a fan of the Monster Hunter series, so I was obviously tempted to buy this game, and I was far from disappointed when playing this.

Pros:
 - Wonderful Graphics ¹
 - Thriving Multiplayer
 - Enticing Storyline
 - A Good Challenge
 - Powerful and Extensive Soundtrack ²
 - Well Balanced Gear
 - Hours of Content
 - Many Different Builds for Any Playstyle
 - New Things Added All the Time
 - Easy to Learn

Cons:
 - Some Difficulty Spikes ³
 - Failing Happens Alot ⁴
 - Connection Bugs ⁵

Overall this is an amazing game that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys the Monster Hunter franchise or just loves a good hunt.

¹ Requires a decent PC
² I don't know why but it is an oddly nostalgic OST for me and I can't seem to think why.
³ I am looking at you, Rathians (Maybe I was just under-prepared)
⁴ Don't worry, it's part of the game
⁵ Only affects multiplayer, I haven't had this problem in a while
[b][h1]“In the aspect of ambitious Hunter and friendly Nyan”[/h1][/b]
I want to talk about my aspect of game as overall experience. Although, there's some issues from PC porting, but it doesn’t hide the fact I still enjoy the game.

[h1]Welcome, Rookies and Veterans [/h1]
Monster Hunter: World (MHW) is considered as fifth generation of Monster Hunter series developed by Capcom. You play as hunter, receive task to hunt or capture various monsters as they reward you their components for advanced weapons and armors. Unlike previous titles, MHW is designed to introduce new players with more casual gameplay and new mechanics, yet it still remains complex and challenge hunting as core gameplay in seamless environment. MHW is powered by MT framework game engine (same as Dragon’s Dogma, RE, DMC) with improve AI and Havok physics to simulate realistic experience and most alive world in the series. 

[h1]The Hunter’s Story [/h1]
The story takes place in part of New World. You play as a hunter of Fifth Fleet (customized via character creation), working on expedition to study the migration of Elder Dragons. The team first encounters Zorah Magdaros, one of massive Elder Dragon which motivates research team and hunter to track down Zorah as part of main campaign. Story is not always the strongest selling-point of the series. MHW did its best to create believable plot and backstory via high quality cutscenes and environment background. Overall, the story is quite enjoyable, even though it’s predictable, has weak character development, awkward moments (especially your assistant “Handler”), and bad lips sync.

[h1]Simple Hunt, Endless Approach [/h1]
MHW gives you freedom of choice to approach the hunt. You start from basic hunting knowledge as the game constantly introduces new mechanics (tracking, gathering, traps, environmental advantage and much more). Lots of information and UI are thrown into screen, but it’s become handy once you get used to it.

There are total 14 weapon types (11 melee and 3 ranges). Each weapon has different distinctive move set, combo, weakness, and strengths. It serves purpose and role of combat one way or another, yet allow player to find best weapon to fit their own playstyle. Landing hit always feel satisfied and weight from hard-hitting Greatsword to sky dancing move of Insect Glaive. One thing I would mention is combat in MH series encourages player to master their moves, position, timing, alongside with monster behavior. It’s something you’ve to get used to, as some weapon require higher skill than other, but reward very satisfied outcome. MHW also introduce “slinger” as sidearm, allow you to shoot various bullets type that you collect from environment or monster part. It has grappling hook to traverse faster or reach higher ground to mount the monster. Moreover, you also have “Palico” as cat-like companion to support you in various ways depended on its equipment which you can freely customize.

The game features five main areas filled with different biomes and settings. From dense ancient forest to beautiful coral highlands, every sub-area is full of details and routes connected each other. You tracking targeted monster by collecting dropped samples to reveal their location and level up research point, allow you to track them more easily. Yet, those research points will be used for various supporting feature such as plant greenhouse, crafting Palico gears, trading random materials, including information of monster. 

Hunting is MHW very dynamic and fluid. Gameplay also emphasize on environment interaction and vertical combat. Taking advantage of high ground to mount on monster or kick Paratoads to paralyze big monster is always amusing. Sometimes, you encounter random turf war between two or more monsters. Let them fight while you hiding in bush. Breaking monster part for specific loot and capture when target shows sight of weakness for better rewards. All are just a small part of MHW experience. Thanks to very smooth character movement and monster animation alongside with responsive keyboard control (although some default setting need to be tweaked). You can also team up with other 3 players for chaotic fun experience (like launching a friend to make aerial combo using your hammer or gang up monster with trap and barrel bomb) as the monster become tougher and aggressive based on party size.

[h1]Progress, Unlock, Enhance [/h1]
After each quest, you can choose to freely explore in Expedition mode or back to main village “Astera” where it serve as main hub of various side features to upgrade your hunter, crafting, create meal for buff, receive special task, decorate your home with capture small creatures, or meet other players in Gathering hub. Every loot and quest rewards you with new special gadget, gear recipes, and unlockable features makes you’ll feel like constantly improved. The smithy allows you to customize gear, each weapon has different tree build and armor set has its weakness and strength. Yet, you can use mixed skill from armor set, depending on what monster you’re facing as the element damage and ailments do matter on higher rank monsters.

On a side note, UI and inventory system could be a bit messy and confused for first time, but it major improved game flow once you get used to as player can customize loadout, wishlist, name, guild card, and quick crafting which is very useful during real-time hunting.

[h1]Sound of New World [/h1]
While most of voice acting is decent and lip-sync performance is hit-and-miss, MHW has amazing soundtracks and ambient musics. They're memorable, film symphony orchestra, and motivated during hunt as it play dynamically on certain situation. Most of sound effects are solid. Large monster give you terrified roar and distinctive to define their identity.

[h1]Ending is just The Beginning [/h1]
MHW still offers more end-game contents after main campaign, introducing Tempered Monsters, extended upgrading features (augment, jewel, limited removal), and more upcoming free contents same as console version. Side optional investigation, arena time attack, or participate event hunts. Moreover, you also unlock special quests on certain hunter rank. At this point, you might ask yourself or set your own goal if you enjoy hunting more hardened monsters over and over for specific upgrade components. You’re grinding for maximize your gear and RNG can be painful or enjoy random hunt for pure fun. The choice is yours and it’s still worth even though you only play main story.

[h1]Stumble in Technical Issues [/h1]
It’s first time of MH Team to work in PC port. The performance varies on different builds and drivers. Although I had no crash issue on low-spec PC, the optimization itself is very decent. The some textures are slightly sharpened than console version, there are some blurry textures and overused effect, it also lack graphical option to disable in-game DOF and motion blur. Huge particle effect on some area or specific attack can kill FPS due to poorly optimized MT framework engine and how the game function which impact on CPU usage. Inconsistent network connection can sometimes present in prime time. But Capcom manages to finally resolve critical connection issue which I really appreciated (September patch). At this point, MHW becomes much more stable as the developers deploy patches from time to time.

[h1]Verdict [/h1]
MHW is designed for specific audience. People who enjoy hunting, collecting, crafting, tracking progression as based formula. High-risk, high-reward combat but improved accessibility in most ways. It’s not perfect, but it’s great way to introduce new comer to the series, but still offer challenge and fun factor to veterans. At this point, it’s best to find out by yourself and I believe MH Team could deliver QOL update and free content for better experience from now on.

I hope you fine this review helpful and enjoy hunting~
PROS: 
-Able to hunt monsters.
-Able to hunt monsters with friends (when you figure out how to decently connect to other people) 
-New Gear
-Tons of Collectables
-14 main weapons to choose from.
-Cool Cat who aids you. (can customize him too)
-Seeing monsters engage with other monsters

CONS:
-Multiplayer is a bit of hit or miss. Random disconections for me and my friend. 
-No real guide.
-Not completely fullscreen.(some very slight blackspace) 
-No way to adjust the mic volume. Its soo quiet. 

With that being said I have sunk hours into this and I just got it yesterday. 
Very fun. If they can adjust the above a bit this will be a must have. 

Saw a lot of mixed reviews so I just wanted to chime in. Hope this helps. 


This game currently has a few glaring issues but if you're new to the Monster Hunter franchise like I was, this is a game worth buying no matter what. I've clocked 95 hours over six days and I wholeheartedly think this is a wonderful game to experience even with all of the problems. I'll write this review mostly in the context of players that did not play the PS4 version, and I will treat this mostly as a game for newer players that are unsure about buying this game. Bear in mind that Capcom has done a messy job with the port as a whole, but the game itself is a masterful experience. 

The Pros: 
-Monster hunting is amazing. You legitimately have to think your way through as you progress through the game. 
-14 choosable weapons, and every weapon is viable for the most part to progress through the story. Some weapons naturally have an advantage over certain mobs over others.
-Progression is wonderful, and there are trees to each weapon that you can pick. Some weapons are unique and customizable. 
-Beat monster, then use monster bones to fight bigger monster. That's the joy of monster hunter! 
-Solo gameplay is amazing, and in my opinion the way to experience MH the first time, especially when youre facing new monsters. 
-Very detailed world design, 5 unique areas each sporting unique monsters to hunt.
-Diverse skills that each armor sports, making proper builds an actual thing. Build does matter, and will increase your damage!
-T-Rex that breathes fire

The Meh: 
-Story is interesting to some extent, but hard to really get invested in.
-Characters are unnamed. They're literally called "Handler" and the like. 
-No glamour/transmog system, so you can't cover an ugly looking armor that might be good for your build.
-Lack of content after completing your own goals, and not currently caught up with PS4. 
-Iffy control schemes, simpler weapons like the Bow won't mind it at all, but weapons with more button presses will want a controller. 

The Cons:
-Multiplayer is BROKEN for most people.  D/C from my own session even though I'm in Discord fine! 
-The game is not very well optimized, a few particle heavy bosses in the very endgame will absolutely tank your fps, even my friends with good rigs have complained about it.
-The game renders entire maps together, so some of the worlds you'll experience worse performance because of size and complexity. 
-Denuvo

Is this game worth $60 to you? Maybe not, but I had a wonderful experience and I would certainly recommend at least playing through this game if you have never played a MHW game. The people who have given negative reviews are correct in that the optimization and connection issues are absolutely horrendous, but many of them also speak from the point of view of someone who has already played the PS4 version and expect better of Capcom. If you're a new player that has never played a MH game, you MUST play this game.
I'd like to stop playing, but I have some more weapons and armor to craft. A few more optional quests to do. A few more investigations to get more monster parts. Oh, that armor looks good on my Palico, but I really want to make *this* one. Oh hey, let's try a different weapon - wow, this is like playing a totally different game. I wonder what *that* other weapon is like?

I really need to go to bed. I have work tomorrow.

But I have to fight this monster at least one more time to get that weapon I want...not to mention that *other* monster for the parts for the new weapon I'm using. I'm having a hard time beating that guy solo, but I can drop into a multiplayer game and me and three other strangers will kick the crap out of it.

I can put this down anytime I want. Yep.

Oh man, I can't do this game justice in a steam review. Get it. Get it even if you never played any of the games before. Get it and try to at least get to the credits and see how the game treats you. It may be frustrating or stressful to play at first or seem maybe boring at first glance, but the second you make that first push, oh man, it's like nothing else in gaming. Maybe the servers seem to treat you badly but it's really not that bad compared to the sheer good the game offers. It's really not intrusive at all and you can reconnect from the main menu. Connection->recently played or somesuch. You're welcome.

Full transparency: I am a huge Monster Hunter fanboy. Full-on, rabid fanboy. I can however, without bias, tell you that Monster Hunter World is the best Monster Hunter game made so far. From a technical, conceptual and executional standpoint. I could tell you the technicalities of the game, but everyone does that already so if you're into that then you're wasting your time reading this. This is why my first sentence is what it is. I can't do the game justice here. I've written and rewritten what I wanted this part to be many times but it's just not coming together. I can't say it easily. It can't be said easily. It has to be peeled back layer by layer, but if you're a newbie, then probably nothing of it would mean much, if anything at all. 

So you want to get into Monster hunter? Fine, ...fine.

Go, and type: "Monster Hunter Zero" into the Youtube searchbar and watch the video from the channel: "folga". Even if you have the game already or have started Monster Hunting relatively recently. Done? Play this game. With friends/family if you can. Convince 'em. Did you like it? Play Iceborne when it comes. Play at least one of the previous games if you can. If there's a will, there's always a ship willing to sail you in that department. My recommendations are: Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter Freedom, Monster Hunter Dos, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Monster Hunter Tri and 3U separately, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. In that order and one by one if you can do all. FU&P3rd or GU if you can't. This is important: Don't rush. Did the new MH after Iceborne come out? Play it. Think you done enough? Are you satisfied? Can you swing a fish to beat up some dinosaurs with now? How about a chainsaw? Two chainsaws!? A bone? Use cats to beat up cats. Eat some Kirin Cheese. Eat some wyvern head. Shoot unlimited elemental works from a weapon no one cares about. Make the coolest looking sword straight out of Gothic 2. Or a drill from TTGL. Or beat up Gurren Lagann. Make a mix set. Make 50 mix sets. Try out a new weapon. Sharpen your weapon back up to yellow. Sharpen your hammer, sharpen your anvil, sharpen yor bagpipe, sharpen your recorder-bell, sharpen your wyvern head. Go into mud. Go into lava. Go into water. Go down into a hole. Go up a mountain. Get deep into the jungle. Lie down into sand. Listen. Catch fish. Catch bugs. Especially the Killer Beetle. No wait.. Shinig Beetle? Shine on you... Killer Queen..?? Take those sweet as.s jeans and dodge some bayblade spins and boom-booms from a living train. Get rabies. Eat a pill that gives you rabies. Curse that flying as.shole that he left the area again. Look into those blue eyes and hate them and then love them and then be annoyed and then be content. Pick up some poop, pick up some rocks, pick up some weed and shrooms to heal yourself with. Collect honey and post how many you got. Time out on trying to get specific fish. Time out trying to find a flying chode. Triple cart, quad cart! Get rocks thrown at you by a cucumber, get rocks thrown at you by a monkey, get poop thrown at you by a monkey, get snow thrown at you by a monkey, get spit on by a monkey. Get blown up and away, get poisoned and die trying to find the antidote you didn't pack. Get eviscerated, get smashed and then get smart, get fed and get your revenge. Reload your bowgun, reload your flintlock rifle, reload your armcannon, reload the siege cannon, reload your axe. Look at those ruins, so mysterious. Steal some barrels and acorn from cats. Have your pills stolen by cats. Give your cats acorns and barrels and boomerangs. You can find that tower in the jungle right? Go up to the top. Find silver and find gold. Let your gavel ring justice off ther thin tin skulls. Find speed and find serenity. Find wind, find the flames, find the mists and find a phantom lightning bolt. Find yourself in a world of poison and fire, in a world of poison and water, in a world of greenery and blood, in a world of snow and wind, in a world of the sun, moon and sands. Then you know what? Go sail a bit. Sail on the sea of sand. Marvel at the swimming mountains. Then sail on water. Ponder why it's so strange. Ponder why the story is so bad, but the lore so cool. Wonder why the sky above Schrade is always dark. Then see it yourself. Hear about it, read about it. Hear the legend and then BECOME the legend!! And then.. disappear. Sail across the sea, see the new world. Started in the new? Then you know the essence of all this is here as well. Go and see where we came from, you won't regret it. Bash your head against the wall and listen to the ring in your ear. Remember now? Do you hear it now?

If even a single person reads this whole thing and gets deep into MH, I hope you'll remember this and read it again in two, three, five or even ten years. Happy Hunting.
In the beginning it wouldn't recognize my controller, however this was fixed by going to Steam>Settings>Controller>General Controller Settings and activating Xbox 360 Controller there.

Berry nice game otherwise.
Whenever i think i'm getting stronger, Monster Hunter World never fails to flip a finger. 

In this universe, there's always something more powerful than you. And when you defeat that powerful thing, after countless efforts, the satisfaction you experience is extraordinary. You're like: "I AM THE STRONGEST MAN ALIVE." 

And then a Nergigante just one hit kills you. Guess what Nerg, you're next, buddy.

10/10 a great game
[h1]The best game released in 2018 without a shread of doubt in my eyes.[/h1]

Unfortunately it had a bit of a rocky start, in addition to some odd decisions.

Most negative reviews on this game will most likely talk about "connection issues", MHW had quite the rocky start regarding server stability. 
Those issues are long gone now, the only times I get disconnected nowadays I only have my own internet to blame. If you go looking at the negative reviews, pay attention to how many hours they have played and think about that.

The secondary thing I feel mentioning upfront is that while this is a game where cooperation is highly encouraged, for some reason other players can't join your story quests if you haven't seen the cutscenes first. 
This can be rather annoying if you are playing together with friends, and unfortunately there is no good solution for the players. 
So you'll end up having to do the quest alone, watch the cutscene and wait for the notification that you can use SOS Flare. At that point your friends can join, alternatively you leave the quest and group up together with your friends, doesn't matter.

There aren't *that* many of the story missions, the meat and bone of the game is beyond the story so to speak.

With that out of the way.... (just skip to bottom if tl;dr)

[h1]Visuals[/h1]

This game is absolutely gorgeous! The environments are beautiful, there's plenty of places to explore, paths to find, things both inanimate and living to collect and obviously monsters to hunt...

You'll be able to see a monster from far away, so if you have clear line of sight you can spot monsters much further away than other games would allow.

The monsters look fantastic, and they actually have like routines to their daily life. So if you are sneaky enough, you can follow after a monster and watch it as it goes about its business. It'll mark its territory, leave foot prints, maybe spit/puke on trees and the ground and of course hunt. The monsters don't take kindly to others coming close, neither hunters or  other monsters. So while you're hunting one monsters, you might find another monster who decides to fight the monster you're hunting! 

In fact, everything in this game looks great. Except for the handler, but you can change her looks with mods if it is too much.

[h1]Combat[/h1]

This game probably has one of the deepest combat systems I know of.

When you start playing, you'll get the choice between the basic metal version of all the weapons.
Your choices are: [list]
[*] Great Sword
[*] Sword & Shield
[*] Dual Blades
[*] Long Blades
[*] Hammer
[*] Hunting Horn
[*] Lance
[*] Gunlance
[*] Switch Axe
[*] Charge Blade
[*] Insect Glaive
[*] Bow
[*] Light Bowgun
[*] Heavy Bowgun
[/list]
There is no [b]right[/b] choice when it comes to picking a weapon. While some situations might feel better with certain weapons especially if you're still learning, overall all the weapons are very balanced and offer quite different play styles.

Not only do the weapons offer a nice diversity in play styles, most/all of the weapons have a surprisingly deep system of attacks and combos.

As an example; the great sword might seem real straight forward, but it has a move that can be surprisingly effective against monsters. Normally you'll be slamming that baby down on the monster, and if it attacks you'll try to block or dodge. However! If you master the shoulder attack, you can interrupt the monster's attack and possibly even stagger it, leaving it exposed for more hurting.

Another example is the insect glaive, essentially a polearm that comes with an insect that you can feed to make it more powerful. With it you can jump up a little to do aerial attacks, or swing around on the ground. But if you take the time to collect essence from the monster(s) you hunt, you'll unlock stronger combos and even aerial attacks that allow you to stay airborne for as long as your stamina and/or essence lasts!

There are many examples like this, so if I feel somewhat tired of a certain weapon I can just change to a different one for a completely different feeling in both tempo, damage, and intensity. For example, if I'm lazy I'll just go gunlance and play it safe. But don't mistake that for gunlance being a tame weapon, in the right hands it can destroy monsters.

In some cases, the weapon has a different playstyle based on the upgrade path you picked for it.
The weapons can deal all sorts of damage. Anything from the typical elements like fire, ice, thunder over to stuff like poison, dragon (yes) and even debilitating effects like paralysing and even sleep. Yes the monster can be forcefully made to fall asleep during combat, for reasons you'll discover.

When it comes to actually hunting the monsters there is [b]ONE[/b] important thing to always do.
[h1]Observe the monster.[/h1]
That's dead serious. Capcom's Monster Hunter series is one that rewards patience and due dilligence. When you fight a new monster, focus on just understanding it first. How it moves for attacks, roars, where it normally hunts, where it roams and even where it sleeps... If you don't pay attention, the combat can quickly become punishing or as some might say, "like dark souls!!!".
Unlike that game, the attacks of the monsters are well telegraphed (most of the time) and while a monster can feel really overwhelming in the beginning, with time you will conquer it and dominate it.

The monsters are well designed, both for combat and movement. While some fights can feel frustrating because of the hit boxes being slightly misleading on certain monsters, it's overall a very fair system. You'll learn the ins-and-outs of the monsters in no time.

[h1]Levels/skills?[/h1]

There are no levels in this game. There is hunter rank, but it's mostly just an indicator of how much time you've spent hunting. So a HR 50 have as much HP and stamina as a HR 1 player.

The difference comes down to the armor, decorations and of course the weapon they are carrying. 
The gear you choose will eventually have more to them than just defence and resistances, they will have skills available.

Some skills will increase your max HP, some will increase your raw damage, some will increase elemental damage, some will make you dodge further or even make you eat faster! (yes)
Additionally more powerful equipment will even have set bonuses. 

To obtain the gear you want, will require lots of hunting and that's half the game.

The game loop can probably be summarized as plainly as this

Hunt monsters for materials, use the materials to craft better gear, use the improved gear to hunter stronger monsters and keep trying to reach higher and higher!

It sounds simple, but that satisfaction of finally beating a monster you've been struggling with is so good. It's a game where you can noticably see the difference between the "old you" and the "new you" after playing for a good while. 
I currently have 430 hours in the game, there is still so much for me to learn.

I barely know how bowguns work, I have never used charged blade and there are many weapons I don't use much or haven't mastered yet. So I wouldn't be surprised if I find myself having more than 1000 hours in this, because it's just so [b]fun[/b] hunting with the weapons in MHW.

Looking forward to the events that are still coming to MHW, and I especially look forward to the announced expansion Iceborne.

I don't really know what more to say. I love this game, it's fun, it's a game I can keep coming back to for more action. In a way, this is my "skinner box" game. Good thing I picked a game that doesn't have microtransactions or loot boxes. 
Just pure quality and fun (and some pain...)

TL;DR

You hunt huge monsters with cool weapons
You can mount the monsters
You can use a wide variety of weapons

It's a really satisfying game with a good repetition loop. It's an easy game to get into, and hard to master. Just gotta play it at your pace.

Ignoring the nitpicks I have about it, a 10/10 game.

[i] “To hunt successfully, you must know your ground, your pack and your quarry.” [/i]

Monster Hunter World (MHW) is a third-person action game with light rpg elements developed and published by the company CAPCOM, who are also responsible for the creation of the Monster Hunter game series (2004). The original console version of MHW was released in January 2018, with a PC adaption in August 2018.

[i] Pro & contra: [/i]

++ Gameplay. Easy to learn, but hard to master. Each weapon (14+) demands a different tactical approach in combat. The various monsters have their own attack patterns, weaknesses and environments. Hunting and gathering facilitate the creation of better weapons and armour. This in turn allows for specialized equipment in order to hunt bigger beasts.
 + Level design. The different world areas are full of rich detail and offer plenty to discover. The flora and fauna provides an endless array of useful collectibles.
+ Companion. Your feline sidekick can be customized, has some useful skills, and will support you in combat. Yet, the Japanese obsession with cats has been pushed to its extreme in this game.

o Multiplayer. The flexible cooperative MP options let you play the numbers game to take down your adversaries. But the irregular disconnects will lead to rage inducing moments.

- Story & characters. Boring Godzilla scenario threatening the invaders of the new world. Clichéd characters & silent protagonist. A fraction of the content is synchronized. Console based text progression.
- PC adaption. Every action you take in this game beginning with the submenu navigation, over inventory management, down to drinking a potion - while being chased by a fire-breathing monstrosity - will remind you of its console roots. Little effort has been invested into the adaptive work for the PC version.

[I] Summary: [/i]

Personally, I feel it deserves most of the praise it has received and I enjoy the gameplay immensely. The hunting and gathering culture represents the core element of the game, and it has been excellently executed. Nevertheless, it is being held back from being great by the suboptimal story-telling, PC adaption, and reoccurring server issues.

Recommended for curious adventurers and people with a cat fetish.

I had never played a Monster Hunter game before this, but World has definitely turned me into a fan. The fights are exhilarating, and I always feel like I'm making progress towards something- a new gear set, a cosmetic, an upgrade for the base, or even just filling out the monster guide. The environments are sprawling, beautiful, and full of opportunites to use the terrain against your foes. 

I have been playing the game entirely in co-op, with no issues after the first couple weeks. Playing story missions together is unintuitive, but only a minor inconvenience once you've figured it out. And story missions account for a very small amount of the content- this game is huge.
[h1] [u]The Short of it[/u] [/h1]

[u]Pros:[/u]
+Combat is very fluid and focuses on the use of combos.
+Awesome hunts, each hunt truly feels like a boss fight
+Incredible, beautiful environments and monsters to fight 
+Diverse, varying weapons to accommodate different play styles
+You get the bestest, most adorable cat companion who will be there for you through thick and thin.
+Food looks great and is also cooked by cats!

[u]Cons:[/u]
-Optimization isn't quite as good as one would hope...
-Denuvo is reportedly causing a lot of issues for other users
-Have randomly disconnected from online despite my wired connection being fine
-Keyboard+Mouse controls aren't great

[h1] [u]The Good (More in-depth)[/u] [/h1]

+Gameplay: The combat in Monster Hunter World is its main attraction, and does so fantastically. Combat is incredibly fluid and heavily centered around performing combos to maximize your damage output. On the surface all looks and behaves well, but the game in general is quite the resource hog (focused on more below). Be that as it may, the game's combat in itself both looks and feels great, and so comes off as a positive point.

+Hunts: This is the main thing you will be doing in the game, and I can happily say that each new creature you hunt is enjoyable, in the sense each hunt feels similar to a boss fight, as it should. Fighting each new creature, figuring out their attack patterns and weaknesses is what makes each new hunt so thrilling, and MHW does just that with this release.

+Graphics: The game looks great, simple as that. Each creature you meet and the expansive environments to travel in are stunning.

+Variety: You have a total of 14 weapon classes to choose from. Each providing their own sets of benefits and demerits, and allowing you to take on different means of approaches for a hunt. These varying classes basically allow at least one fit for any hunter to mesh with their preferred playstyle.

+Cats: Your Palico companion, and chefs, are simply adorable. That's really all I want to say, but your companion in specific is very helpful and still gives you a partner if running solo. Your Palico can assist in a variety of manners be it in damage, defense, or restoration. 

[h1] [u]The Bad[/u] [/h1]

-Optimization isn't the best, more modest rigs are going to have a tougher time of running it (my 1080 barely passes 60 fps on high in 1440p, even when out of combat). 
UPDATE: After turning off volumetric rendering for the fog in the advanced settings I'm getting between 90 - 100 fps on high. Hard to say how much of an increase lower end rigs will experience so I'll leave this up as a "buy with caution" point.
UPDATE 2: According to hardware monitor my i7 8700k almost reached 100 degrees celcius, this is NOT okay. Yes the game is more cpu intensive, but to the extent that my hardware is well past the threshold any CPU should reasonably take shows that the game is more poorly optimized than initially thought.

-Denuvo: people seem to be experiencing a lot of issues and from what I'm seeing it seems mostly due to the anti tamper denuvo in the game. If it's as bad as it seems, you may want to make sure your computer is compatible which, if it isn't, will suck for more than a few I'm sure (knew there was denuvo but didn't interfere with my experience, guess I was lucky). 

-Online: It's only kinda functional, at first playing with my friend was a bit confusing due to how lobbies worked but after figuring it out we got to hunt together, BUT we have experienced connectivity issues in the game and randomly disconnected from one another. As we were continuously communicating through discord, it's evident that this isn't an issue with our actual connection to our internet.

-Controls: I've personally opted to use a controller from the start, and have no real complaints about the controls. But experimentation with the KB+M felt very off. The mouse in particular behaves like a joystick rather than a mouse for aiming with the cursor, and causes for some incredibly awkward movements. There doesn't seem to be any way around this either. I'd recommend a controller if possible for other buyers, but this will come as a bummer to many if not (unless this is later fixed of course).

[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]

My first real Monster Hunter game in the series and I love it, recommended to all, newcomers and veterans alike. Will update more if need be as I play through the PC version.

Additional info: After playing through the game a bit more, more issues have sprouted up. The game works and I am indeed enjoying it, but there are many who are going through worse due to these stated issues. As such, I advise caution to purchasing this game immediately, it may be best to bide your time and see how the game is patched.

Info for MHW on PC:
- Make sure you disable ‘volume rendering’ in your graphics settings for a huge FPS boost (literally adds 20fps)
- Connecting to friends lobbies is done through steam friends list
- Squads are actually Steam Groups so be sure to make one with your buds

despite all the problems, all i just wanna do is hunt down monsters solo or with friends. As long as the game does what a Monster Hunter game does, any small problems i encounter doesn't make me feel like i wasted my money. Plus its on the PC now.
I played old MH on PSP for about 2000+ hours.

World is all about "Hunting" and "Gathering supplies".

Hunting is not all about how fast you can kill your target, it's about  cut and break monster parts for your arsenal improvment.

Well. To put it in short, it's good old MH with lots of core gameplay improvement.

Fans must play it. Newcomers should appreciate it.

Great game.

If you are new to Monster Hunter, prepare for the long hour journey and, mostly, grind to fulfill your inner OCD to collect all types of weapon and all kinds of armor in the game. Haha.

The game went from disastrous release to a smooth sail in a couple of weeks. After a few tweaks and fix here and there from Capcom, Monster Hunter World is finally enjoyable on PC. The most annoying issues I had before was connectivity and mouse camera control that feel sluggish (even though I mainly use gamepad, but sometimes switch to mouse/keyboard). Now:
- No more server issues.
- Mouse camera controls are very fluid.

The graphic is certainly amazing. It is certainly a major improvement from previous installment in the series.  Some people are complaining about low texture quality, but I don't feel bothered with it because when I'm on the hunt, don't usually pay much attention to it.

The gameplay is challenging as ever, with ridiculous hitboxes and the sluggish movement of your character even when using light weapon like dual blade or sword & shield. But all that hurdle will be rewarded with the iconic music at the end of the quest, but with the most awkward last hit. "A little poke to the toe of that Nergigante, bam, quest finished. Okay I guess, let's carve it."

I think things that lacking now are, the optimization of keyboard control (Rename loadout with escape? Oh come on. And don't forget to press F1-F4 first before using items in quest), and the lack of meaningful event. I get it, baby steps toward better future right? But those steps're better be like Xeno'jiva's one, or people will lose patiences with this already scarce roster of monsters.

All in all, I think this game deserve to be put in your library. Just find a friend to play with 'cause hunting alone is somewhat boring in the long run.
For those who read or have experienced losing their save due to killing Xeno'Jiiva, [url=https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunterWorld/comments/998xpi/xeno_save_corruption_bug_does_not_exist_proof/?ref=share&ref_source=link]from Reddit:[/url]

[h1]There is no Xeno save corruption bug.[/h1]

We can all stop posting about this and please go into your negative reviews mentioning this and remove it.

There is no save corruption bug from the final boss. It is now confirmed.

The issue is somehow the PC's affected by the "bug" are missing required standard codecs to play the cutscene.

Once the game autosaves after the boss has been defeated, it attempts to load the cutscene and crashes.

The autosave's next call is to load that cutscene, so it appears "corrupted" when you load because your game will crash.

This can be tested by viewing the palico tool video's in your house. If you have a "corrupted save" from the xeno fight, you will crash when viewing the palico tool videos.

If you crash, you are missing or have corrupted codecs.

You need to download and install this:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepack

or

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/web-media-extensions/9n5tdp8vcmhs?activetab=pivot:overviewtab

Apparently windows 7 gets pointed to this version. It lists different versions of XP as the required type so mileage may vary. Including it up here as u/zAmplifyyy passed it along below :

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=16546

​

*update* From u/BellerophonM and u/eihen below

Not all editions of windows ship with these codecs (N and KN), which marks them as optional and requiring handling if absent.

Euro bro's with the issue or anyone in Korea apparently with a N or KN version of the OS is not technically equipped to run MHW. You need to install the media packs.

If you are affected by this lack of codec's, Please update them using the above links.

If anyone finds any better links, feel free to share them or DM me and I'll add them above.

And please, for everyone's sake, the developers, and the overall health and wellness of the game and the related Subs:

[h1]Stop. Perpetuating. A. Falsehood.[/h1]

For the money I've spent this game is absolutely best I've ever played. I've regretted at least once paying for any other game I've played but this! This is even worth more ( I don't want it to be more but for what they set price to and the content we've received is unbelievable ) . Again I'm not that much of fan of previous game versions or ever played them.  But this game was amazing. 
Pros : collaborations and play the game looking like the character you've played in other games and fighting dragons and monsters : ride, slay, capture and even throw dung at their face to make them flee away! The weapons and their usage unlike other games if you want to support or DPS you dont need to create new character and level or farm items in it. The same character you're using can be anything!
Cons: Some connection issues at first but they did compensate as much as they can. Some bugs exist but which game doesn't have them ? And extremely powerful monsters and strategies ( and when I say strategies they are not that complicated and everyone can sure get them but just need to understand things around. If not what is the fun in making strategies if they aren't at least hard to make ) But either ways strategies can be copied from internet if you want to as all games. No grind and grind so much time and no force you to buy anything. 
Summary: No Pay to Win! Now this is important. Expansions are incoming and they are huge and will be on sale. But except that one expansion everything else is your choice to get it or not! They even gave 2 character editing vouchers to change your character looks. What else is needed for a game. But the requirements and all are a bit high compared to some low tier pc(s).  But its time to update graphics imho. Till when will you sit and blame the games that they are having high specifications and all. You wont be sitting around your old graphic cards forever ( No offense though). 
In total I would rate the game to 9/10 and it has some improvements for the last 1 point that are just acceptable imo.

Good start point for first timer, is simple and is fun.

Perfomance is good so there's nothing to worry about.

Narative is simple and there's cutscene, though you can not skip it.

The combat is easy but hard to master. You need to chose your weapon, there's a lot a weapon choices, chose what really fit your playstyle.

Event quest is seriously what's keep me playing after finished the story and all optional quest. Because the rewards is always unique and worth to be collected.

I played this game since it released on steam and so far i didn't found any bugs, expect that whole connection issue in pre-release. But looks like the connection issues still remains to this date BUT is not as often as it used to be.

Overall a good game for RPG fans, i give it 9 out of 10.
Negative reviews in a nutshell;
Has Denuvo
Lack of some visual options
Connection issues

There, I saved you 10 minutes from going through the exact same reviews.
My cat died 5 years ago and I still cry when thinking about her.. Today I started playing Monster Hunter World and I finished her avatar.. Is good to have her at my side one more time!

Despite a few flaws.. Monster Hunter World is a fantastic game that's easy to lose hours into smashing, bashing and slashing good time!
It’s been a long time since I played a game for as many hours as this one. I just can't stop!
The graphics in this game is breathtaking the monsters are vivid and sometimes feel real like.
every fight is different because the monsters never act the same way, the AI is intriguing to say the least and the depth of the game in terms of crafting and upgrading can sometimes be overwhelming but exciting when you figure out something new to add or change in your build.
You play and play and still figure out new ways to use your weapon and fight each monster.
I have had an absolute blast with World, after bouncing hard off multiple previous entries in the series.  The monsters are a joy to fight, which is important when that's the main draw of your product.  The atmosphere of each environment is engrossing, and the monsters really feel like they belong there.  It can be surprisingly relaxing to just head out on an Expedition with no quest or goal in mind and wander aimlessly through each zone, collecting materials for crafting, doing some bounties, catching some fish, or going after the monsters that happen to be in the area at that time on the fly with no faint limit or time limit(aside from when the monster itself decides to leave the zone).  Each zone being one contiguous location instead of chopped up into several smaller bits like previous entries really helps give it a lived-in feeling, like coming upon the remnants of a turf war between two monsters that happened while I was busy halfway across the map with something else is a neat touch.  Monsters, especially the notorious Bazelgeuse(Bagel Goose), often get wrapped up in your fights with other monsters, and can sometimes provide a much-needed distraction or deal a hugely damaging blow to the one you're focusing on.  The weapon systems are extremely varied and unique, with many weapons using completely different mechanics making them akin to fighting game character selections when you pick which to use.  I personally have only ever used the Greatsword, there's something so totally satisfying about landing that last overhead wallop with it that sends a monster crashing to the ground, stunned.  I have heard from other folks that pretty much every other weapon system is fun to use and engaging.  Collecting materials to build and upgrade each weapon can be difficult and the requirements of some extremely rare drop items for later high-end craftable gear can get super frustrating to acquire, unfortunately.  Same goes for certain consumables, though there are alternative options such as the Melding system to acquire rarer items you need using lesser-desired items you already have.  I run the game on a pretty beefy system, but even at lower settings I've heard the game runs pretty well.  The only complaints I really have about the game running well is it's a big CPU hog, and the textures in cutscenes can be real nasty, but I hear that's a bug that's set to be fixed in an upcoming patch.  Otherwise the game runs at a buttery smooth framerate, dynamically lowering object/texture quality ingame to keep the framerate steady, and the load times are basically nonexistant.  The longest load time is when you first boot up the game, and even then it's like 15 seconds tops.  Every other load time is so fast you don't even have time to read the loading screen tips.

edit: I should mention I play the game entirely solo, I have never done multiplayer.  I am not a fan of the faint limit being tied to all players, so one goober can ruin it for everyone else if they're bad, which I've seen plenty of times on streams.  The Palico system, your cat-shaped AI buddy, is very helpful in fights, acting as a distraction, support, summoning helpers, looting extra monster parts mid-battle, etc.  Plus dressing them up in the various goofy or cute outfits is nice.  I just wish there was a dog option.  A Palicorgi, if you will.  Odogaron's armor makes them look like some sort of ancient japanese wardog thing, but other than that it's all cats all the time, which sucks.  I'd totally buy dog-shaped AI buddy cosmetic DLC.

Overall, Monster Hunter World's been a real surprise.  I'd caught some streams and felt it would be worth trying myself once it came to PC, but didn't expect to fall so far into it, I think as of this review I've got 150 or 170 hours in it, beaten the story, downed every optional quest, found every food item(except a few different boozes), captured/slain every tempered monster, and still have fun playing it.  I heartily recommend this game, and can't wait to see what new zones, monsters, and systems they add in future updates/expansions!
People are the biggest drama queens about this game.

Monster Hunter: World is an excellent game.  It is a pretty game.  It's definitely a game for people with more powerful rigs.  If you have never played a Monster Hunter game in your life before, this is superb.  Even if you've played Monster Hunter games before and want to get back into the franchise, this game reinvents and does away with many annoying mechanics.  No more paintballs and no more loading into 12 different zones.  That's always nice.

So, why is this game mixed?  Somewhat simple.  People don't understand how games these days work.
Here's the lowdown on the mixed review.
When the game launched on PC, it was met with a very unforgiving issue:  Multiplayer only worked when it wanted to at best.  You could never start this game with the expectation that you'd be playing with your friends.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  We had to try dozens of placebo fixes in the remote hope of ever possibly playing with our friends.
Today, August 22, about two weeks post PC launch, this issue was patched.
Now, instead of people changing their minds about this, they're angry it took two weeks.  I work quality assurance for a small company and I inspect developer work.  It is not unusual for something to take a full week to pass QA sometimes.  There is a lot of testing that has to go on and be reproduced that often goes underappreciated.  People are so used to day one patches that they don't realize that day one patches or patches that soon follow a product release are often things that have been caught by QA/Dev prior to launch and have been worked on before it actually hit.
What I suspect happened with the connection issue is that it honestly went unnoticed until launch.  Granted, that's a pretty big problem to have go unnoticed, but sometimes things go through to production that maybe shouldn't.  Bugs happen.  It takes time to fix these bugs.  Two weeks isn't unreasonable for what seems to be a beguiling intermittent bug that can be observed, yet not reliably reproduced.  Even the large userbase of players that were so disgruntled couldn't find an extremely reliable way of reproducing it other than "It just happens" and "I can't connect at all."  Things like this can take a lot of work to try to figure out the underlying cause.  It's just a nice thing to have watched the SteamDB page show that their dev repositories were constantly being updated -- they were actively working on fixing it for the whole two weeks, not sitting around with their thumbs up their rectums.

Now, two weeks post launch.  Connection issue is fixed for the most part.  According to the devs, it's still occuring in some cases, but their fixes have reduced the frequency of it.  Chances are you won't see the effects of this review bomb go away, which is unfortunate.  Without this connection issue, I could see this game being at least in Very Positive territory.  Only very positive because there are still outstanding issues with the game's graphical issues.

One thing you need to be very aware of is that Monster Hunter is a pretty game.  Many pretty games aren't very well optimized to run on all hardware.  This is very much the case with Monster Hunter.  Do your homework and look for the minimum spec, because this game is about as hard on your computer as an Ubisoft title.  Lots of horsepower is required to get this game running nice and pretty, but I've made it work on three different computers.  One with a 1050Ti and an i7-3770K; one with an i7-7700HQ and a 1070; and one with a Ryzen 1700X and a 1080.  The 1050 Ti needed to be put to low graphics settings at 1920x1080 to achieve a good, playable framerate, but I don't think it could manage a silky smooth 60 fps.  The 1070 machine can run the game beautifully at high settings with no real issues.  Perfect smoothness on the i7-7700HQ/1070 build was achieved by turning volumetric fog to low or none.  Finally, the Ryzen 1700X/1080 build managed just fine on max settings, though volumetric fog was turned down to help assist in certain frame spiking situations.

With that said, your biggest enemy to performance will be the volumetric fog effect.  It looks pretty if that's what you're used to, but turn it to low if you want to keep it.  The difference is minimal, visually, but the FPS impact is very significant.  Turn if off if you don't like fog in the distance.
Now, the last performance hitch of note is the lightning effects.  Heavy lightning effects occurring on screen, especially from player-based attacks, tend to drop frames for no understandable reason.  Avoid having more than 2 people in your party using lightning-based weaponry, or you'll start to get into unplayable framerate territory.  I have faith this issue will be patched in time, but as of the time of writing this on August 22, it's still ongoing.

Finally, one last major gripe I'm sure you're going to see coming out of the bag of negative reviews is that the game uses Denuvo.  You'll hear all sorts of horror stories about it destroying solid state drives and killing your CPU performance.  It does no such thing, and such claims are unsubstantiated.  I will agree to the sentiment that most games I've played that run Denuvo DRM tend to hurt on the CPU performance side.  You will find that people have articles up about how Denuvo tanks performance, but you often find rebuttals about it.
Point is, Denuvo sucks.  Maybe in a decade it could lock you out of the game if it goes under or support drops or whatever.  The bottom line is this:  You will not be playing Monster Hunter World in 10 years.  You just won't.  Games For Windows Live was dropped a long time ago, and some computer games 10 years back were still using it.  When is the last time you touched a GFWL game?  Very likely you haven't in the past few years.  Stop worrying about Denuvo maybe someday making this game unplayable.  When that happens, you'll have long moved on from this game.

Would that I had more space to write about the actual game, because there's a lot ado about this game.  Check the positive comments that offer proper reviews on what the game is made of.  Monster Hunter titles are exceptional fun.  I wrote a few paragraphs in this review before being interrupted by the character limit here.

To sum things up, Monster Hunter games are about bringing low very big and powerful monsters.  To help with this, you have a very wide and fun arsenal of weapons and hunter tools to go about this job.  You must track monsters, find these monsters, then target their weak points while addressing shortcomings of your own, such as elemental resistances, to take them out.  There is a wide variety of them to hunt and it is difficult to get bored in this game.

If you've played other Monster Hunter titles in the past, this game is more streamlined than its predecessors.  No more paintballs, no more zoning in to a dozen different spots.  It's all interconnected.  You have scout flies that loosely guide you to your hunt mark.  There is a shorter list of monsters in this title compared to others, but QoL improvements here make the game worth it.

If you have any pressing questions, feel free to comment on the review and we can chat.
Cons:
-Not much voice dialogue from the NPCs;
-Can disconnect if does alt+tab with frequency;
-Not the best HUD navigation but not the worst either;

Pros:
+Everything else.
quick and dirty review:
1. this is a pretty awesome game
2. capcom knows how to do combat
3. you get 14 well balanced weapon types each one has like 20+ variations with upgrade trees and then you can socket the items and upgrade upgrade upgrade
4. also there are little cat dudes named palicos - can get 2 at once + a monster when solo

i guess the story is a bit light this isnt a game to play for the story :D
just an update

bit of spoiler

stop reading now if you dont wnat spoiler

[spoiler]
Game has hunter ranks

hunter rank 15 is the end of the story game. cutscenes etc

Pros,
- It's Monster Hunter. Combat joy. See below.
- Fights that require learning and improvement.
- Progression through gear *and* personal experience+skill.
- It looks great. (even at low settings)
- Plenty of weapon styles.
- Monster Hunter language for speech available. 10/10.
- All weapons are great. Except Longsword because fuck everyone using it. Including me.
- High variety and decent depth of tools and their respective uses.
- Lots of gear building.
- Inspiring soundtrack.
- Long grind and lots of stuff to do.
(the stuff below was added because a dumbass made a good point)
- You have a pet cat that sort of talks. It fights with you in duos/solos if you allow them.
- Cats have armour and weapons.

Cons : 
- There are bad players, beware. (reviews about how the monster 'predicts' your attacks)
- There are bad players hoping you can wail on monsters just because you dodged.
- Some of these players did not just give up and are still playing, BEWARE.
- This game is not for potato PCs. Seriously.
- Low settings can take awhile to get used to. 
(still looks alright to me,  but it is a bit of a downgrade from high/medium)
- The AI is pretty scary if you're not prepared. 
(If you want a punishing beat-em-up, go to Dark Souls, instead.)
- There is a long grind. It's what this game is about. 
Grind for parts, make stuff to grind for more parts.
- Disconnection issues may have been improved upon, but are still there. 
(possibly caused by Steam, rather than MHW?)
- Again, this game is *seriously* taxing on one's system. Potatoes be warned.

Summary
- I am having way too much fun.
- Soloing is easier, don't let scrubs mislead you on this. They're just bad. Multiplayer is dealing with a harder AI to read and way more HP to break through with reliance on teammates who may or may not be good.
- This is not a game for people who believe that if you outplay the monster by dodging, you get free hits. All you did was dodge. Now find your damn opening, because dodging me spitting at you doesn't mean I can't still punch you in the teeth.
+ Incredibly exciting boss-battle game
+ Very rewarding; your success might partially be determined by the gear you grind for, but mostly by your skill
+ Wide selection of different weapons with wildly different play-styles
+ Much easier to get into than previous Monster Hunter games
+ Looks amazing
+ Tons of content and regularly released new content (free)
- Poorly optimized for PC
- A bit clunky to play coop in Assigned (story) quests and expeditions (free play)
- Grinding for non-monster parts is not fun

Also, note how many negative reviews have played like 100+ hours and are just mad cause console has more content or just didn't update their reviews since the first week which had problems which were patched out.
Gameplay : 8.5/10
Graphics : 7/10
Performance : 7/10
Controls : 8/10
Story : 3/10
Multiplayer / Community : 8/10

Really similiar with MMORPG game but u no need compete with other. Just challenge urself with time.
Reminder : Very grindy! at least need 300+ Hours to have mostly jewel/ Decoration.
I Hope developer keep update with new content~
With all of the latest PC patches:
- No more unresonable disconnects; never happens now after recent fixes
- Motion blur can be toggled
- Mouse movement support
- Better Optimisation (somewhat)
- Skippable cutscenes
- Lots of Bug fixes

One thing I must criticise however is the lack of content, NOT in comparison to console edition but the entire MHW title. But it hasn't even been an year yet since release, something that MHW team can fix and hopefully meet my expectations.
In the start when the game was out i was a little hesitant because of the heavy price tag, but after i got it eventually and began playing it, there hasnt been a time where i could say i was bored and done with the game. Probably one of the most fun CO-OP and single player games. The game trailer in the store page barely shows u 5% of the content the game actually has. There is so much to do in the game that you will never run out of things to do. Right from Story mode Assignments to Optional Quests to investigations. The game has everything whch will make you wanna grind your ass for. 
The only real problem i have faced in it is the server disconnection issue & there is no option to reconnect back if u DC from a quest or hunt. 
Apart from that this game is a 9/10 for me...It rightfully won best co-op game of the year 2018...
If u want to enjoy with friends, this is def something you shuld look into...

Great fun killing and crafting. Even though it's my first Monster Hunter, it did a decent job easing me in, and now I'm a fan, and will be picking up future titles, no doubt.
i bought this game just days before it went on sale. feels bad man
that said, monster hunter world is the most fun i have had with a 60 dollar game, in recent memory.

a lil background, i played monster hunter freedom 2, then unite, on the psp back in the day. i was looking forward to playing this game for a while, but i was discouraged by the bad reviews when it came to pc. reports of GB bugs, corrupt saves, multiplayer with friends being unplayable. 
my experience with the game has been smooth af. no bugs.
even seems like monster ai has been improved alot since i played. i have only seen the monsters acting weird once, maybe twice. although, i was never bothered by that behavior, in fact i think its charming

anyway, yea, if youve got friends who play, consider the purchase. it would be a lot of fun, i bet!

or if you play solo and are having trouble, the game offers ways to reach out for help. maybe you can even make a friend 
:'D
[h1]Connection problems were patched long ago.[/h1]

This is the first port of Monster Hunter to PC, it's not the best port but it's not bad either, now for the good and bad:

[h1]Good things:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]A lot of weapon types and elements to choose from
    [*]A lot of skills wich you can choose from to make your own build
    [*]New content is currently being added by Capcom (This is being written in 10/14/2018, Autumn Event)
    [*]Quite a lot of farming to do for parts, augments and decorations
    [*]Multiplayer has been fixed so you can play with people whenever you want
    [*]You'll have a lot of hours to go if you're a completionist or like farming / slashing big monsters in the shortest time possible
    [*]As some people say that keyboard controls suck you can re-map every key to your confort
    [*]It's on PC, you can mod away all the visuals if you want to as well as some QoL mods
    [*]The only microtransaction present in this game is purely cosmetic
    [*]The OST and visuals are beautiful
[/list]

[h1]Bad Things:[/h1]
[list]
    [*]Farming can be quite tedious until you have some equipment done (by that time you might get burned out of using that weapon and bored out of farming the same monsters over and over)
    [*]It's obvious that some weapons are superior to others in the same tree so some monsters will not be really farmed after comlpeting low rank
    [*]After you end the Low Rank and High Rank missions (20-40h) you're left with events, arena, optional quests and investigation farming. [spoiler]There is no G Rank in this Monster Hunter[/spoiler]
    [*]Some people in the multiplayer are just mixmaxers that will try to shame you for "not being good enough"
    [*]There are, as obvious, some hackers that can oneshot the monster even in arena missions so they might screw up with your arena times
    [*]Controls better with a controller
    [*]If your PC is quite old you might want to search for Special K mod to optimize it more
    [*]If you want to change your character sex, hairstyle or skin color you'll have to buy a character voucher (first one is free)
    [*]Interface, damage calculation and skills are quite complicated if you're new to the franchise so the game will take you some time to get the hang of knowing wich skills are the best for what type of weapon and what skills are good and whatnot
[/list]

[h1]Personal Opinion:[/h1]

This is not really my first Monster Hunter, but it has been the one that i'm playing the most and dedicating most of my free time for.
The saga is not really new-player friendly and all the possibilities between weapons, equipment and skills can be quite confusing at first, so there is one little advice if you're new and you want to start with MHW:
[b]Don't bother yourself with having the best set ever and go with whatever you like, everything works, even a sleeping longsword[/b]

Just have fun, get some friends and hunt away. The events that are coming [spoiler]f.e: Kulve Taroth[/spoiler] are pretty good and come with a lot of weapons and armor that will make you emanate big d*ck energy and prepare yourself for the Extreme Behemoth long feared by the PS4 and XBOX players that will come sooner or later to us.

[b]TL;DR[/b] If the game caught your eye check this board

Wow, what a journey! When I picked up MHW, I had no idea what the game was all about - I just knew very vaguely that it involved hunting oversized monsters with some ridiculous looking weapons ...

In the beginning, I had no idea what I was doing - specially with the melding / deco / crafting / etc. Bit by bit, I learned monsters' attack patterns, weaknesses and discovered the weapons that suited my style. Towards the end, I was sniping monsters for their sizes and destroying them in minutes.

Pros:
1. Huge monster variety
2. Lots of fun weapons
3. Crazy looking armor
4. Fun community

Cons:
1. Server disconnects are a pain
2. Even on a hefty PC, the fps battle was constant

Before playing Monster Hunter:
Why are we killing them? There's no reason to do such a cruel thing. This is genocide.

After playing Monster Hunter:
FUKU YU ANJANATH MOTHERFUKER, WAIT 'TIL I MAKE SOME ARMOR FROM YOUR VERY SKIN GODDAMIT!!!
As for now other than technical issues, I really can't give bad review for this game. I really hope Capcom will still fix it ASAP despite my positive feedback.

What I enjoy from Monster Hunter World despite this is my first game of the franchise are :

- Good difficulty progression, at first you will meet normal-hard version of the monster then harder version then hardest version of the monster. All in good step progression.

- A lot of things to do, not counting the grind for the end game which really optional. There are alot of things to try, whether you want to collect all armor, trying all weapon, collect all palico's gadget.

- Co-op is really optional. As for me I always try everything solo first because of the challenge then after If I want to co-op I can hunt with  my friend or just use "SOS" feature to help random people

- Good for Casual player and Hardcore player. Casual can just play the game as it is until reach tempered version of monster, both solo and co-op. Hardcore can aim for min-maxing the equipment through endgame. It's really up to you.

- Endgame Grinding is optional. Unlike MMO which something you need to do if you don't want lag behind. As for me once I beat all monster solo until tempered elder dragon I feel satisfied enough. I don't really attracted enough to find all decorations and augment to complete my gear set. I'm still gonna continue tho to try other weapon, but probably not as intense as usually I play.


What I dissapointed from the game :

- Lack of Raw Mouse Input. This is the only reason I don't try range weapon. I don't like playing range using controller, but when I try using K+M the mouse really feel weird. Alot of suggestion how to tweak but I really can't get it enjoyable. Capcom really need to fix this.

- Texture bug. My rig is not the best, but for texture I usually can get the highest option. Despite that it's still not look too good

- Network Issue. This is the only reason preventing people playing co-op and why it's worth to give negative feedback for this game. 

- Not enough explanation for some feature in the game unless console player told us. Yes I'm talking about radial menu customization


Mixed feeling :

- Amount of Monster, I feel it's good enough but after I read some of comment about number of monster in previous game I feel like MHW can get more too. Hope Capcom will add more monster other than the one they release in Console version
I've been playing MH games for many years now, and this is my favorite by a good margin.  I enjoyed it enough that I played it all the way through on PS4, and bought it again when it released on PC to then play another 170+ hours.  Whether it's your first MH or you're a veteran, if the pics and information on the store page interest you at all - get this game.
Best monster hunting game ever!

+Developer maintaining the game well
+Worth the price to buy
+Lots of boys and girls playing it
+Solo and coop play
+Awesome detailed graphics
+Varies monster to hunt / capture / slay
+14 types of weapon to use / learn
+Tons of classes to build
+Tons of materials to farm
+Great looking sets if into fashion
+Easy to play once master it
+Palico companion is the best :)

Overall, great game and recommend it.
So,which one are you ?
Monster Hunter ,Or Monster Hunt er?
And I am really glad to see MHW came out on PC and on STEAM.
Didn't know if I can play this far solo , but still it's so great to have a few fellow hunters with on quests.
And thanks again to those fellas who've spent so much wonderful time with me being hunted by monsters!
I highly recommend THE GAME in general, but I do not recommend buying it here just yet. There are a lot of problems going on. For example, the game takes up %100 of my GPU & CPU. That means I basically can not have anything else running in the background. Even music buffers. I have way higher then the "minimal" requirements they list here, and my game could hardly run on the lowest settings. Now if you only have a PC and really wanna play this, me and a few others did some research and found out a few things you can do to help with the problems their settings are having, that should last you until they actually fix it.

You need to completely turn off all of the following settings:
~V-Sync
~Volume Rendering Quality
~Anti-Aliasing
~Z-Prepass

You also need to do the following:
~Play in "Borderless Window" instead of full screen.
~Set your Frame Rate to "60".

When I found these fixes out, I was then able to play on the highest settings (minus the above obviously) and have things like music, Twitch, Discord, Pandora, or YouTube running in the background.

Now the game itself is amazing. I have it for both PS4, and PC. Amazing graphics, amazing fighting, amazing armor, amazing hunting techniques, just... amazing. I very much recommend playing it.
this game makes you feel like youre an anime character in the best possible way
plus you get a cat friend and you can collect more pets AND it has a fishing minigame so really that's all anyone ever needs in a game
The overall mixed rating was definitely deserved when the launch problems were still present. Those problems have been fixed now, though, and I can say without hesitiation that it's one of the most amazing games I've ever played. I've grown really bored and disillusioned with gaming over the past few years, between the rise of mobile-gaming inspired lootbox bullshit to the annoying prevalence of fad genres like Crafting Survival and Battle Royale, but there's a pure joy and sense of wonder that permeates every little detail of Monster Hunter World.

It has that feeling of love and care that the really special games have. The attention paid to every aspect of this game is astonishing to me. Those carrier ants that you see moving across the path? Sometimes they're carrying little bits of treasure you can take. That monster you're tracking? It got really thirsty and took a trip to the local watering hole. You thought one monster was bad? Well, here's a second one, and they're fighting now, and oh yeah, that one just dropped the other off a cliff.

It's games like this one that make me remember why I fell in love with this hobby in the first place.
YOU want to become a lone wolf type of hunter who hunts the same monster with a different skin in different maps? YOU are a die hard MH fan or just a random guy who 'praises the sun' than don't even bother reading comments, I ensure you that this is your game to go 
if not you better wait for a sale or maybe even act like u never heard of this game


Starting with the cons

-This could have been the GAAME OF THE YEAR but sadly I felt like I was fighting the same monster over and over and over again with differet skins and just one bonus attack (for those who are too dense to understand I am not talking about hunting the same monster for loot).

-multiplayer is also sad to talk about; no one is there or the people who are playing are whether cheating (I haven't heard of bans yet) or just waiting for u to get the hunt done.

-The story kinda feels poor and outdated (as ever).

-I felt forced to eat evry 10 min. (the boost is vital and feels more like a must than optional)

So if u are excpecting to find a nice coop game or dozens of totally brand new monsters u will be dissapointed.

The pros

+The maps are really cool and have a refreshing variety from jungle to monster graves.

+U can catch anything moving from ants to birds, fish and co and pet them.

+Your fellow can talk to some of the monsters and can use them in battle (your cat can use them as mounts which can be an advantge)

+U can craft a lot of items 

+Its the best looking monter hunter so far

+Its really good balanced so that actually nothing feels impossible (like a Souls Game)

+Gigantic weapons with good weight feeling (Artorias great sword is missing T_T)

since it has more pros for me I recommend it ^^

ps: don't forget to eat properly and praise the sun
How to Monster Hunter World,
-step 1: track monster
-step 2: get slapped by monster
-step 3: respawn and use sos flare
-step 4: let other people kill the monster
-step 5 : wonder how you got to HR 29

I normally don't review games, but seeing monster hunter world with "mixed" on steam feels awful. There are technical problems with online play on launch, and capcom could have maybe handled it better, but it shouldn't detract from what's essentially an amazing game. If you're a fan of tight combat and a immersive environment, this is a must-try title. I've bought this game on PS4 and again on PC, and I'd definitely say it's worth the money.
I just wanna say over the Last couple of years playing MonsterHunter as a series! Monster Hunter World Feels like a [b]Massive[/b] Improvement over the older titles..

Over the older games, MHWs Player Movement feels a lot more smoother, and moves a lot more Freely 
With older MH-Games it felt slow and Restricting like in Monster Hunter 3 (my first Title) but Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate they changed it up a bit and had an over-all better & Smoother Player movement! 
But still.. MHW feels like they Nailed it this time!

In older games there used to be loading Screens Between each area, Which is understandable with the use of older Consoles with there Power[b]/[/b]Storage n all that stuff.. it would take me out of the moment of Hunting the Monster.
[b]BUT[/b] now Running on more bigger & powerful Mainstream Consoles Its able to do with out loading screens between every individual area!!
I find it Simply Beautiful not having to run through loading screens during your Hunts!
Don't even get me started on the new [b]Graphics[/b]! It's a [b]HUGE[/b] Improvement!! (That's an understatement)

Yea I know! There's not that much Content in MHW just as yet.. Guessing probably because of the new Graphic-engine there using, But the game is still fun nonetheless!
In my opinion MHW is a Vast improvement over older games!

I'm been playing Monster Hunter sense [b]2011[/b] and I'm Still Enjoying it..
I feel like over-all they've done a Great Job with is Game!  [b]9/10[/b] Highly Recommended!!
If you're new and see that this game has mixed reviews,it's because connection problems that happened at released and it's already fixed

If you're Monster hunter fans, I think you'll love it
If you're new at Monster Hunter series, fyi this game is more easier than handheld series. So,it's ok to try it.

And also they still update this game
NOTE : Don't forget to sleep because this game can steal your time and make you forget about your real life
Been playing Monster Hunter World for a few days now and it's time for an initial review.

Out of all the MH games I played, this is by far the easiest, though it's still challenging in it's own right. You can run while using items, (cept for traps ofc) which is a HUGE help considering that a big-ass monster is always after you. Crafting is a breeze since you can automatically have things crafted as you gather mats. Gathering is also easier since you can just spam the gather button while passing by resources (although there are special nodes that could be mined a lot that requires you to stop).

The servers aren't stable yet, but once it is, this would be a pretty fun game for enthusiasts and newbies alike. Just a friendly reminder, though, this game isn't easy. Don't expect it to hold your hand and the monsters could one shot you if you don't know how to dodge/block. To quote a comment I read today, this game isn't for people who think they are Rambo. I mean, unless you're a light bowgun user lmao.

If you want a challenging game and you don't have the phrase "I quit." in your vocabulary, hop right in! This is fun!
I've been waiting for a Monster Hunter world to finally come to a platform i own. So far beside the optimisation and unstable connection, i am literally in love with the game. I will play it for a very long time and I cannot recommend this enough if you are interested in this kind of gameplay loop ( prep , hunt , craft , repeat ). 

But beware , you need a pretty decent PC to run this game until it get more optimized and the connection error can get really annoying.

A Great Game but a Bad Port unfortunatly.

Edit : 2/7/2019

Pretty much all the issue has been fixed and the game run fine. Stop reading and go buy it :)
If you like games about humans wielding weapons twice the size of their body to kill monsters the size of a double decker bus, this is the game for you. 10/10
As a person playing MH on PSP only, this game is a huge blast with new arsenal of weapons, new monster, new mechanics and HD Graphics....

This game even run on my "potato laptop" with 30fps :
Intel Core I5-7200U 2,5Ghz
Nvidia GeForce 930MX 2GB
4GB DDR4 RAM

The only issues was the disconnect rate is pretty high during first day of any event due to server overload

Highly recommended, 11/10 would see Pickle smack down Diablos again
500 Hrs in, 
HR 350,
grinded most rare deco,
augmented every armor,
stock up 500 Mega Bomb/ Max Potion / Mega Potion.

take on 10 EX-behemoth quest,
failed all of them.

12 /10 would die again
*Sigh*

With 400+ Hours on record right now as i'm writing this, i think its time for my review of this Amazing game.

[b] I WILL BE MENTIONING SOME LATE-GAME STUFF IN THIS REVIEW SO IF YOUR SOMEONE WHO IS PROGRESSING THROUGH THE STORY AND HAVEN'T PLAYED MHW BEFORE, PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THIS MINOR  SPOILER.	[/b]

Much like other players, MHW Was my first introduction to the Monster Hunter franchise, and it was a stellar experience from start to finish. The Graphics are not the best, but amazing enough to give you this experience that you are walking on a living breathing land. Talking about living and breathing, the monsters are absolutely spectacular, this game has you thinking, calculating and observing what the monster does next and countering it with your own attacks, The designs are well done and amazing and the cutscenes perfectly reflect their role and power in the region they thrive and live in.

The regions are extremely well done and the monsters that live in their respective regions make sense as to why they live in those places. My personal favorite Region is the Coral Highlands, the fact that Highlands are sustained by the life energy of monsters that die in the Rotten Vale gives me this feeling that i am walking over a land that is ACTUALLY living!

The Story of MHW wasn't a top for me even though i am one massive lore nerd as it was pretty blank in concept, the story missions were basically the same thing copy-pasted with a different monster. From the first mission your objective is to kill some Jagras, your second mission is to kill some Kestodon, then the third mission is to kill a Great Jagras, then the Fourth mission is to hunt a Kulu-Ya-Ku, it's the same thing over and over with some in-between stuff like the Pink Rathian trail things and all that, but the cutscenes compensate for the lack of a story in my opinion.

[b] I know this review isn't going all that in-depth about the game, but i tried to rush this out as fast as possible cause i just couldn't hold it back to write my kind of Love letter to Capcom about a game that snagged me in  and wouldn't let go just as i won't let it go now.	[/b]

[b] 9/10	[/b]
I played Monster Hunter Generations on the 3DS and this one is much more streamlined. Despite this game being more user friendly, it's still incredibly cryptic and you won't get far without doing some research on your own. The game doesn't do the best job of explaining itself to say the least. Also, the multiplayer menus take a minute to get used to. The process of figuring out how to get multiplayer to function the way I wanted it to was pretty annoying.

Now that my gripes are out of the way, this is one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics are beautiful. Sound effects and soundtrack are fantastic. And most importantly, the gameplay is superb. A perfect balance of grind and reward. It doesn't take long before you're wearing some awesome looking armor and feel somewhat powerful with your weapon of choice.

That being said, this game isn't easy. Not only is every weapon super unique and have different purposes, but you need to be very good with at least two or three of them to get by. Learning the combos and proper technique takes a bit of research, unless you go with the dual blades or sword and shield builds. The boss fights are incredibly difficult, rivaling Dark Souls and similar style games in difficulty. But it just makes the grind that much more rewarding.

TLDR: Game is repetitive, but that's the point, grinding the same monster over and over to gain better equip. If u r not a fan of that, don't buy this game. The story is plain and simple and feels like it was made onlz for sake of having in game. I didn't like the characters at all, all are forced. There are some bugs now and then, but my biggest issue was terrible hitbox on many weapons/mosnters. But still one playthrough of it was enjoyable, so if u don't mind grind, give it a try in some sale.

Pros: 
-Customization of character is pretty solid and complex
-Variety of monsters, armors and weapons with ton of movesets.
-Coop, players in base making it slightly more alive.
-Interesting biomes/maps with more to do then just killing big monsters
-small tasks like gardening, research, etc.
-Great for lovers of grindy games.
Cons:
-There are some minor bugs or texture glitches (at least I experienced them)
-HITBOXES ARE BROKEN. Not only those of monsters but yours as well. Many time you will be glad you managed to hit monster even tho it shouldn't but it will also happen vice versa. Monsters many times were not even near touching me but I got hit. It was infuriating. This is not a bug, this is just lazy. It took a lot of fun from many fights for me.
- PC is getting major events in great delay compared to consoles


Even tho there's ton of armors, also in ng+ I dislike a lot of them so I didn't find grinding after finishing story for the first time appealing. (this is rather my opinion only, ur might differ)

In the end I would give this game 7/10. It's not bad but it's not that amazing as I hoped it to be. Like I said minor bugs and broken hitboxes were too annoying and the grind felt unrewarding in ng+. It's worth getting in some sale. I got it in 50% for 30 €.

*To join story mode with a friend, both of you need to see cinematic (so you need to launch quest solo, get to the part where cinematic start, leave quest and launch it together).
Wonderful game with fantastic graphics, slighty grindy but rewarding. If you like long dramatic battles with huge monsters I would definitely recommend this game.
First of all I need to say that this game has a shaky review ratio because at launch it had a bunch of connection issues with multiplayer, lack of some PC support and other things, but those have been solved in a couple of weeks. The game has absolute no connection problems and the only time I can remember getting a disconnect from a session in the last 5 months was from the whole Steam going down for 10 minutes.

Monster Hunter, a franchise loved by the Japanese market and once considered to be kind of cult with a small audience in the west is now taking over the world. It's no coincidence they named it Monster Hunter: World because this series has finally fully bloomed to the western market. 

As someone who never played any monster hunter games before (aside from 20 minutes on a 3DS demo that I didn't really enjoy), I must say I fell in love with this game. Played over 120 hours on my friend's PS4 and then moved to PC when it launched and as of now I have 219 hours on PC. My review will be focused towards the people who never played any MH games, since that also was the case with me.

[h1]Story[/h1]

As the name suggests, in this game you hunt monsters, the whole universe it sets in is about hunting monsters, the very society that exists in the game revolves around monsters. It's a place full of wonders and mystery, where you go out in the wild to face against nature, ultimately to preserve the balance and avoid a disaster. 

The story is nice, not a huge masterpiece or anything, but it is what you expect it to be and is well delivered, it gets you immersed well enough to be entertained. Basically you're part of an expedition to another continent that has been going for decades trying to understand the behavior of a certain important monster, one that can change the whole biome around it. You need to track down that monster, gathering clues about its moves and why it is heading that way, but of course it won't be simply as easy as that.

I can't remember very well now, but when I first played this on the PS4, it took me around 50 hours to finish the whole main story, that's a pretty good amount of time for a main campaign. Aside from the main campaign, you have many optional quests to do and they give you even more quests which give you tools to use, new kinds of food, armor, improved facilities and more. There's a lot of content. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

It's great, it feels awesome. You go alone or with 3 other people on a hunt and you got several different weapons, each of them feels really different from the other, they have their respective strong and weak points and gameplay styles. Hitting monsters with them feels very satisfying, be it from cutting a tail off, to knocking them out for a while after a heavy it on the head, to breaking their claws and other parts, it feels like you are really hurting the monster and your work pays off. 

This game has countless different builds you can make thanks to the skills you get from wearing the hundreds of armor pieces, set bonuses and jewels to tune to your playstyle. There's no real "meta" in this game, as often adopting a defensive build is more effective than going full offensive, even if you are good player. You can modify your armor according to your needs and that will change on the monster you are hunting too, as some of them will require you to adapt to their respective threats.

The grind is real. Get ready to grind, a lot, this game has a lot of RNG involved when it comes to getting monster parts and most importantly jewels but FEAR NOT! Even if you hate grinding like you're used to in other games, like I am, the grind in Monster Hunter: World does not feel like a chore to do, it's fun. I know it may sound like crazy talk, but this is the first game I played that I really didn't mind keep grinding hoping to get what I wanted or jumping into someone's quest to slay a monster just for sport. 

Preparing for a hunt and using everything you have at your disposal will prove to be an essential thing for you to master. You may be able to tackle the quests with brute force alone at first, but soon enough you will learn that preparing for a hunt is the best thing you can do to achieve success. Usage of traps, consumables, tools, environment, all of that can help you hunt the monster. Don't be shy to explore your craftable items list, take a good look at what they do and use all that to your advantage because down the road you will need it.

The game is often updated with new and FREE content. That's right, DLC is completely cosmetic, no need to pay for new monsters, weapons, armor or anything, they give you them for free. There are new events going on every month with things for you to do and collect.  Now that the game has been out for a while, there won't be any new monsters popping up but new versions of them still will be introduced, adding a new challenge and armor. However, there's an expansion coming in autumn 2019, which will need to be payed separately, containing a whole new continent, monsters and the continuation of the story.

[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]

It is great, the tracks blend in nicely with what is visually presented and really fit the action. Featuring orchestral music, MHW's soundtrack can be easily considered "epic". 

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

Probably the "black sheep" of the this whole game. The game looks good, that's not an issue, however, it was made primarily as a PS4 game to be played at 30 fps and when the PC version was announced everyone was expecting it to run smooth as butter with their machines at 120 fps, but that ended up not really being the case. To be blunt and brief, the game was not very well optimized for the PC, even with a rig that is well above the capacity of a PS4, MHW is a game too demanding for what it offers and that's sadly a negative point about it. [b]However, don't get me wrong, you can still play this with no problems if you meet the minimum specs and go above 60 fps with maximum settings[/b], but it's not what it should've been, they should've done a better job, a job really focused on the PC. To me, that's kind of a common issue with Japanese developers who seem to still not trust the PC market very much, maybe that will change in the next game now that they know there's a good market for their franchise here.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

Monster Hunter: World is a fantastic game and I very strongly encourage anyone to try it. It is worth every singly cent it costs. I'm very glad I was able to find a new series to be interested in that offers me a very unique and satisfying experience. To me, this was the best game of 2018.
i mean it's basically Duck Hunt 2018, but with bigger ducks.

the game is pretty simple, just stab the thing that moves until it stops moving, so in a way it's like Spy from Team Fortress 2 a lot as well.

so if you are a big fan of Duck Hunt or Team Fortress 2, this game is definitely for you, your skill and experience in those games will basically transfer to this game directly so you can go straight for the big guys.
I don't get what the fuss is all about, i enjoyed it very much, at max settings the monsters look amazing, and they move so realistic that i am amazed everytime i see it. I just keep going in for more. With a new world coming out with new mosters, aka seeing that the game is getting supported/dlc after release seals the deal for me. Its a positive from me!
I have to thank Dauntless for moving to the Epic Store and make me decide to buy MH:W to avoid using that crappy store. This game is superior in every single aspect. The weapons are amazing and all feel very unique, the monsters are a joy to fight against.

I am 20h in and can see myself playing this for a very long time.
Super surprised to see the review score as mixed, picture a dark souls boss fight, for every fight. it's great, I've been a fan of the series since the PSP, this game can suck you in and steal your hours with "oh man I just need a couple more of X scales to craft this armor. oh but then it has X skill which will pair well with X weapon, I just need X bones to make" repeat.
10/10 IGN can recomend, better tahn dank souls, when starting the game I recomend you get some lube, really makes your weapon slide down the monsters throat
After playing for more than 300 hours, the game is rich and vibrant, and there's still new content being released every 3 weeks and skills to master. Learning something new everytime I play. 这是个挺不错的游戏哦。
This game is for people who enjoy boss fights. This is not a game to get if you're looking for a game with a rich story. The story is more of a system to introduce you to the different mechanics. The monsters are designed well and the combat system is good. Putting the weapons away can feel a bit cluncky when using one of the slower sheathing weapons, such as the switch blade. The weapons are quit different and exciting, however the designs aren't the most interesting. 

You CAN play the whole game by yourself and defeat any monster, even the late game ones. The monsters difficulty scales when playing by yourself or with someone else. The co-op is fun, but mostly only if the people in the party are your friends or if you know them. If not, it can get a bit frustrating if they keep on dying, since the amount of lives are shared by the whole party.

This game is for people who enjoy boss fights, mix maxing skills to counter the mechanics of the monsters and exploring the world.
Yet, another great addition to the monster hunter series. In this game, you are a hot blooded chad hunter. As the hunter, you must get used to the act of clubbing open monster skulls. Do this another 20 times (per monster) and you'll be equipped with the flesh and bones required to make your fashionable pimp armour. Doing this allows you to progress through the game, by bitch slapping each and every single living creature you see.

First complaint to this game would be it's lack of character customizability (bust size).
Another complaint would be the lack the jiggle physics.
For veteran hunters of the series, this game may appear to be "too EZ". That may be true, but the game is constantly updating, and challenges like the upcoming "AT xenojivah" will hopefully prove make you wished you were never born.

Overall 10/10 game, would recommend.
The title of the game summarizes it perfectly: Hunt monsters, use the loot to make better gear, hunt stronger monsters.
A simple premise, but complexity of the combat and character-building keeps me coming back for more.

The thing I probably enjoyed most was the wide variety of weapon play styles: I started out the game dancing around monsters while cutting them to ribbons (long sword), later I switched to mashing monsters' faces around with a Hammer, and down the line I experimented with raining down mortars with the Heavy Bowgun.  Each was fun to play and had its own move set and style to master.  There are 14 different weapon types and I only have tried out half of them since I have enjoyed my time with each so much (not to mention that each weapon type has over a dozen upgrade trees).

Highly recommended and best enjoyed with friends
This game just smacks you in the face every times you go "Hahaha i got the best gear i am OP now" by only making the game harder. The community is super helpful, especially when you spend 40 minutes trying to kill a monster and someone joins to help you out of pity ((If you are really lucky and fall under a session with a bunch of higher level dudes that slay the monsters that makes you actually crap your pants, with relative ease.))

Overall, highly recommended.

11/10 would recommend investing on adult diapers and laundry while playing it
I've been a fan of this game since second generation monsters, all I want from it at the moment is for the previous generation monsters come back in this game

Pro: MONSTER HUNTER, SO MUCH EVENTS

Cons: kinda slow early game
It is fun grinding and farming all your items until you get to the late game, but it kind of feels like it needed a proper ending, or probably the game isn't finished yet, maybe that's the problem, it's fun playing online and all that, but there's always the fear of disconnecting from a match out of nowhere or finding partners that get one shot because they haven't upgraded their gear fully, all in all, I would only recommend playing this game with friends, it's the only way I found it fun, at least in the end game
As my very first Monster Hunter game, I would say I'm pretty impressed!
Makes me want to play other MH platforms too.
Just like most players, I really hope they keep developing and adding new stuff in this Game.
Really hyped for the upcoming Iceborne Expansion!
Keep it up Capcom!
Great starting point for anyone looking to get into the series. 
It controls very well on mouse and keyboard, tried messing around on my gamepad also very good.
The game looks so good, I mean like wow.
Only a few areas in the game but they all are multi layered and have a load of good arenas to fight your hunt in.
The monsters will run into eachother and throw down, makes the world you'll be hunting in feel very alive.
Some parts of the environment can be used to help in the hunt, keep an eye out.
You get a fantastical cat companion!
Great game, loads of fun to play, grindy but very entertaining. 

9/10 Bazelgeuse dive bombs
What this game does, it excels at. A vibrant, beautiful, and diverse environment with plenty to see and plenty more to hunt and be hunted by. The monsters are cleverly designed, and the challenge ramps up quickly without feeling unfair (Except for Kirin. Friggin' cheap -the rest of this trails off into muttering and profanities-) 

The downside of the game lies in the repetition. The title really says it all. Monster Hunter. It's what you're doing. It's pretty much all you're doing. There's a clear feeling of progression and growth, and the game play is fluid, fun, fast and better with friends. But there is definitely a clear grind and repeat pattern that will not appeal to all players.
This game might be grindy, but its the best end game experience when you are finished with the main story. The amount of stuff you can do is crazy, easily 500 hours of content.
MAN......This game is something. Honestly there isn't a ton to the story kill like 2 to 3 dozen monsters and game over. Yet its going to take you at least a hundred hours of gameplay to even beat it. ITS SO GREAT THOUGH. If you like to grind in a game to get just one thing then this is the game for you. It isn't easy but yet its one of the best games I've played in a long time. also it dosen't matter if you have never played any other monster hunter game because this was my first and it isn't needed to enjoy this game.
TLDR; Fun action RPG with well designed (appearance and mechanically) monsters and good customisation, fights can drag however, and bad hitboxes 7/10 would recommend to people with patience

Pros:
-monster appearances
-armour and weapons are visually appealing and satisfying to unlock
-variety in weapons change how you fight monsters
-diff monsters require diff approaches
-figuring out how to beat a monster is EXTREMELY satisfying

Cons:
-fights can drag on too long sometimes
-inconsistent difficulty 
-poor hitboxes (both for getting hit and hitting monsters)


8/10: Despite the somewhat lacking monster count, Monster Hunter World is an enjoyable experience certainly trumping that of other games.

Movement within this game is refined, weapon-play is fluent and accurate, and all have had major revisions to allow the game to include more motion during the actions.

As mention before, monster count is rather lacking, but that doesn't mean it's not fun to fight them.

New to the game are the scoutflies, which seek out a tracked monster. The scoutflies get more accurate you find traces of the monster, and eventually lock-on to their exact position. 

As you battle the monster, its' research level increases, and the initial tracking level starts higher, making it easier to find and kill the monster again if desired.

I am newbie to this kind of game, so far i am loving it, a lot of mechanics to learn, even small details are vital when you go out hunting in this game , for example with a little tweaks in meal you take at canteen can help you boost certain effect in your gameplay. I am not fan of grinding materials to make a better equipments / gears, but this game completly change my opinions regarding the matters, cause the graphics, the environment, cool looking gears, different kind of boost for each type of equipmentsetc.  i am still learning all of it .i really recommended to anyone enjoying whacking monsters, walking around in beautiful with cool looking gears, with each equipments you forge on that difficult monsters it is a satisifaction.

9/10.

Thanks for experience Capcom
I thought the being in a loving and caring relationship with my partner was rewarding. This is legitimately better than having sex with her and it puts out every time without an argument or talking back. 10/10
Games like these kind of suck ass but for whatever reason this one is actually pretty fun. Although it can feel really challenging and some of the hunts can last literally like 2 hours, its still a lot of fun. I'm not sure that its worth $60 though to be honest, because although it does have a lot of ups, most of the time it can feel pretty repetitive and bland. But if you are into games where you have to give it a good grind in order to progress than you will like this game. The one thing that did happen to me that pissed me off was when I was fighting this monster for like 1 hour and for whatever reason he wouldn't die, in the end it just said the monster has left the area and I had to restart in the very beginning,

+gives you a sense of accomplishment when you beat a monster or level

+story is pretty interesting and easy to follow

+playing with friends is where this game really shines 

+lots of different potions and types of weapons that make for great variety 

+campaign is long af 



-gets repetitive 

-can get very hard at times

-sometimes can glitch out and make monsters immortal

-can be confusing if you haven't played a game like this before

over all 8/10
Never played a Monster Hunter game before, it was a little overwhelming at first but it does kind of guide you step by step.

Since I've sunk waaayyy too many hours. I plan on sinking many more. It does become a bit of a grind at end game but that's almost the fun part!
Ok i am gonna give my honest opinion about this game. So At first i was reluctant to buy this game because of its bad review which is bad network connection when playing with friends , at first i did not believe so i ask my friends and they told me that theres really bad network connection which will make u disconnect when playing with friends. Despite the negative comment i decided to put my faith on this game and i bought the game, and i started playing mhw and surprisingly this game is not that bad just that theres a small network issue and the rest of the game is fine. I would suggest this game as its super fun but grindy which is my type of games!!
I've really been enjoying this game! The graphics are really nice, even though I don't have all of the settings to max. It is a resource heavy game, so be prepared to potentially not have anything else running while you play it if you have some older gear. The environments are beautiful, the fights are fun, and getting to play with friends makes it awesome. There are a few minor things that I would change to fit my personal preferences (a more dynamic customization system, mostly), but overall I have greatly enjoyed it!
I literally wanted this game as soon as it came out, when i finally got it, It was not let down. This has to be one of my favourite games now. I love the graphics and the amount of detail that has actually been put into the game. The story is long and the missions are interesting and fun. Also the character details are fun to play around with and i love the amount of armour sets and weapons you can create.

Would really recommend giving it a go. Deffo worth it
Monster Hunter World is one of those games you are skeptical about, it removes so much of what made Monster Hunter so known for, such as the expansive roster of monsters, the hardcore aspect of user unfriendliness and the outlandish and out there designs in favor of a smaller but in depth monsters that are fun or at least adequate to play against, a more user friendly experience and a more streamlined, grounded look.

The single-player experience is great, the game now gives you guidance on various game mechanics and there is plenty of objectives to strive for such as gear and time taken to kill a monster to name a few.

Multiplayer has been vastly downgraded though, more of a chore now due to the difficulty scaling and horrible lobby experience, nonetheless sometimes it is fun to play with others and some hunts are downright impossible without teammates to help you out.

Overall, not the Monster Hunter most are familiar with before the release, but very much earns it's place as one of the best entries of the series to date, it's like DmC: Devil May Cry gone right.
Great jumping Jaggis, this game is like someone proposed, "How about we just take the old Monster Hunter and make [i]everything[/i] better."  I don't see how fans of the series wouldn't fall in love with this game.  There are countless gameplay and quality of life improvements over the older titles.  I think this is also the most accessible Monster Hunter game to date.  I've already got some friends into this game, and they're having a blast.  

I absolutely love the Monster Hunter series and this has been my favorite title, hands down.  Only critique I have is for the unskippable cut scenes - I don't play this game for the story, I just want to hit the shit out of giant dinosaur dragons.
With all the praise I could give this game, I'll first begin with saying this is probably the definitive Monster Hunter experience.
The monsters, the maps, the controls; they are so dang immersive. 
The monsters (specifically the larger ones) don't immediately see you as a threat to them, and will even sometimes ignore you completely because something bigger has challenged them, and you simply don't matter. It adds to the feeling that you're weak and unprepared to fight them. Hell, the first time I saw a Rathian, it simply left me alone, because I wasn't worth its time. I stalked it silently, until it noticed I wasn't going away, and then began acting aggressive. 
The maps in this game are no longer connected with loading zones, meaning everything is a huge map to play around in. No longer is the fight disrupted by being knocked out of a zone, or easy escape from a monster possible. You can see monsters moving around in real-time on your map, even when you're not in their zone.
The controls are the perfect balance between easy to learn, but hard to master. Anyone can pick up any weapon and have a good time, but the combos that experienced players can pull off are some of the strongest attacks in the game. You can really feel the weight of your weapon as you swing it around. The slow, methodical fighting makes every attack a strategic play.

If you have the 60$, I highly recommend getting this game for yourself. With an active online playerbase, up to 3 other players can help you hunt those monsters.
How to play MHW:
1. Hunt large monsters.
2. Farm Materials.
3. Craft new armor/weapons.
4. Repeat.

Best game. 10/10 will play again and bombed by beetlejuice repeatedly.
     Don't be put off by the mixed reviews. A lot of negative reviews were added to this game's store page during it's rocky PC launch. CAPCOM's servers were garbage at launch and had a lot of stability problems, the game was also poorly optimized and there were some hardware compatibility issues that many people were experiencing. This has all been fixed, as far as I know. I've had no problems running this game at max settings at 144 fps and have never been disconnected unexpectedly even once.  

     This is the most fun I've had with a game in years. I've been addicted to this garbage game called Overwatch since 2016, playing a few other titles here and there before I would drop them and go back to it, and this game broke that spell. The world is so vast and fun to explore and it rewards you for doing so. The gear progression is unlike any I've ever seen in a game, specifically the visual progression. Gear comes with all sorts of different traits and leaves you with infinite build possibilities. The pool of weapons to choose from is vast, but the game encourages you to try all of them at your leisure by refunding weapon tree upgrades and never penalizing you for making the switch if you decide to spice things up.  

     What's even more fascinating is even after delving into discussion threads on reddit and MHW-related forums, I can't find a single consensus on what the "best" weapon in the game is. It seems to me like the developers did a perfect job balancing all the weapons so that no single one is better than the other, which baffles me considering there's over a dozen of them. Currently, I'm using the Great Sword and I'm loving it but I've got my eyes on the Charge Blade and Dual Blades to try out in the near future.  

     The game offers a consistent challenge from the get go. Each monster offers an immensely different fighting experience that always keeps you on your feet. Being mindful of the fact that all monsters are different is a key component to being successful in the game. Observing each monster's attack patterns, movement, and possible weak spots and developing a fighting strategy on the fly is a truly unique combat experience that few other games can offer. On top of this you'll have to manage things like attack and defense buffs, weapon sharpness, your stamina pool, and obviously health during the fight.  
  
    I could go into way more detail but I think other reviews have probably said it better than I have and if you're interested in what the core loop of the game looks like I'd recommend looking up some YouTube videos to see if it's your cup of tea. All in all, I highly recommend this game. It has endless replayability, it has no microtransactions and is consistently updated with new events and content, and it is an extremely rewarding and fantastically made game. 
  

First off, don't be intimidated by the online component. Story campaign alone is a great value for the price, and the whole thing can be done solo. If you liked The Witcher, recent Zelda, or From Software (Dark Souls) games, you'll probably like this. The combat is deceptively simple but fun as hell once you start figuring out the nuances of your chosen weapon. Online functionality seems to be a common issue, but I've had no problems. Better with a controller, but fully playable with K+M after a bit of adjustment. The endgame grind isn't for everyone, but that won't be an issue if you just want to focus on the story. Well worth the money.
Great game if you are fan of the series. Have around 100+ hours clocked and I can say playing this game gives me a new experience every round.

Gameplay is challenging and this game is beautiful.

Gameplay
Have you ever wanted to skip all the grind on low level monsters and go straight to the final boss? This game is what It feels like; every hunt is thrilling and will keep you on the edge, no matter if you hunt solo or with groups.  It seems very difficult at first; however, if you're careful and understand the moveset of each monster you'll be able to deal staggering blows that feel extremely rewarding. Hunting a monster without taking any damage and getting in the flow of the hunt is pure catharsis.
There is a great variety of weapons, and they all seem to come straight out of an anime, so don't expect much realism if that's your thing; melee weapons like greatswords that take seconds to deal a single hit from dual blades that devour your stamina to ranged weapons like bows that shoot arrows the size of your character and bowguns that can shoot like a minigun, there is always a weapon to fit your style, and they're all equally viable from early to late game so it's all down to a matter of preference, though some are more complex than others.
The game is split in two parts: Low Rank (LR) and High Rank (HR). LR is where you spend most of the main story missions; monsters deal less damage and have less hp but your equipment is also weaker. HR is where true Monster Hunter begins; monsters have more hp and damage but this is where you start crafting your endgame gear.

Graphics
Pretty good, but it's heavy on the hardware and requires a better gaming PC to run it properly.

Sound
No music while exploring the maps, it starts when the monster is attacking you; also becomes a cue to when the monster is about to sleep when it stops playing. Some monsters have unique tracks. Weapon sound effects are very satisfying, and it really feels powerful when you deal a critical blow.

Plot
Barely enough to justify your hunts, don't get into this game if you expect to feel something other than satisfaction while slaying monsters.

Conclusion
Game is fantastic, one of the best I have ever played. No microtransactions or lootbox BS except for a few cosmetic items (and even then, there are plenty you can get by just playing). Port is ok, had a few problems on release but they all seem fixed now.
MH:W is the first game of the series that I have ever played, since every release so far was on a console that I didn't own. I always felt that I'd enjoy the series and I'm totally hooked; hunting giant creatures for "research" never felt so fun.
This is the best game  I have ever had, it is very welcoming for beginners while having a high ceiling. A game I actually enjoyed and kept improving myself. Pretty good!
Firstly ignore the mixed "all reviews" because most of the bad ones were made right after the launch due to either performance issues ( Basically this game was developed from ground up to target 30 fps like its many predecessors with certain engine limitations AND YET Capcom removed the fps cap and did a lot of optimization work in the 7 months following the console release. Obviously it won't hit 60+ fps mark that easily BUT If you have a mid to high range pc you'll get way above 30 fps even during the most taxing visual effects. ) OR connectivity issues ( Give the studio a f-ing break, this was their first online monster hunter experience of this scale, of course there'll be issues when a massive number of players invade the game during and a little beyond the release week )

Secondly HAVE FUN ! The game is close to perfect now with its thrilling combat, insane monster and difficulty variety and ever-expanding rich content such as collaborations with Final Fantasy, Devil May Cry and The Witcher universe. On top of all these the first massive expansion ICEBORNE is on its way too !

Finally though you might want to avoid the game If you are a "story must" kind of guy, not really a satisfactory experience on that front :)
If you don't like monsters shouting at you then don't buy the game.

Although if you enjoy a good RPG with annoying cutscenes then just get it and play. The disconnecting used to be an issue and still can be on weekends but just man up and solo the monster. Once you practice your dodge skills you'll be able to kill any monster and have the satisfaction of a 30+min fight against a fire breathing, exploding lion dragon with blue flames. What more could you want?
This is my first MH game, and after trying out the other games in the series, call me a nub, but this is the best MH has ever been if ya ask me. Best 60 Bucks I have ever spent, and I cannot wait for Iceborne later this year!

Bird up, lads.
Recommend this game 10/10
Game made me broke and im going to be even more broke after the dlc gets released.
It's never too late to join the hunt but once you buy it you'll get addicted.
Pros:

*Satisfying gameplay and fighting mechanics
*Good graphics (level design and creature models)
*Fun co-op experience 
*Fun discovering new armors and playing new weapons/ adapting to movesets
*Many updates and free content

Cons: 

*No PvP (the grind is for nothing but personal satisfaction, learning movesets, and speed runs) So not really much to do endgame

*Terrible veteran MH community- 
These people are so self entitled and afraid of change they will ruin your life if you make any friendly suggestion about changes to the MH formula. Also don't expect any help online or in forums, I once saw a a Vet player tell someone (read this in a fat nerdy voice)  "If you hunt with your palico you're just a bad hunter" 

*Disconnection issues in co-op are consistent

*Player models are ugly (get mods)

*The story is terrible, skip all the dialogue and just play for the fun monster fights 

Even after all this bashing the game is still worth playing imo, you'll get a solid 80-120hrs of fun. 

this is my 1st MH game. and I love everything in this game. sure, there is a connection problem and some bug here and there, but I can understand it. being a programmer, make me a tolerant person while using a program

the gameplay is good, hunting and grinding until you make the top of it. the update is frequent, look like capcom will support this for a few years. with icebourne expansion on the lane. so having this game is worth it, be the content or the update. 

I hope everyone can find what is enjoyment while playing this game. And always try this game with friends, because hunting is so much fun when together than being alone
As a veteran Monster Hunter fan, I actually didnt enjoy this game when it released. Then I got it for PC and I fell in love with it. Yeah, it doesnt have as many monster as the older games have, but it does have some features that make it better for what it is. The series has promise as long as Capcom keeps supporting it with bigger and better updates. I highly suggest this game for new and old hunters. Old hunters need to remember this is a new project. Dont complain and grind through the bad story mode then enjoy it from there. Or just complain like normal. Whatever.

Excellent game now, I dont hate it anymore.
Man where do i begin? I've played Monster Hunter games since Freedom Unite released on the PSP. And i LOVED that game for how hard it was. MHW reminds me of everything Monster Hunter is and that's perfect. This games will give you HOUUUURRRRS of fun and more. SOLO or CO-OP straight off the bat (you have to watch cut scenes before inviting people which is a minor stupidity but hey its worth it) also I play with a PS4 controller! (How it should be)
Now this game is sadly easier than previous MH games but its not a bad thing but i flew through the story with the help of my trusty wife by my side. I'm going to say it, this game for me is a damn near perfect game scoring 8.5/10. Loses points for those annoying moments like Cut scenes stopping you from inviting hunters, Annoying handler that NEEDS to go if their will be a MHW2 (I'm sure there will be) and no on screen support for PS4 controller input (Basically i have Xbone controls on screen instead of PS4, again minor annoyance as i know what button is what) Cant wait for the DLC coming this year in Autumn ICEBORN. One more thing, i do own this game on both PS4 and PC. Made the transition for PC POWER BABY!
Wonderful RPG, very well supported , and didnt have all that much problems online either, replayability is also a huge part of the game. very well polished as well. glad the franchise came to the west, otherwise i would have never known about it.
Incredibly satisfying, varied and deep combat. Awful story. Awesome monsters. Don't get scared by the potential grinding, you really need to play a lot before you encounter any real grinding. Overall one of my favourite games of 2018.
Even with its frequent connection problems still as of today (February 28th, 2019), which is a HUGE negative point since multiplayer is a main aspect of this game (CAPCOM pls fix) this is an amazing game.
Being my first game of the Monster Hunter franchise, I'm loving every minute of it.
A complete grindfest, you kill a dino, get his skin, get a stronger weapon, rinse and repeat. There's plenty of weapons all different from each other, from the technical Charge Blade, to the slow and powerful (and based) GreatSword, to long ranged weapons, etc. Visuals are stunning, and the world feels really alive. You'll even witness monsters having turf wars and interacting with each other which is pretty goddamn cool. Combat-wise it's quite difficult and if you don't have much experience with the likes of Dark Souls (which is similar to this game) you'll PROBABLY get your butt kicked a lot in the beginning.
Definitely recommended.



anyway black diablos = cancer
All you need to know about this game is the best Monster Hunter game series...

But you must have a PC with high Specification in order to get an immersive playing experience ...

                            9.5/10 
                     -=[Best GAME]=-
               -=[Game Of The Year]=-
About 200 hours in. I've passed rank 80, and have used most of the weapons of the game at some point. I will say without a doubt that this is a fantastic game. 

I'll be clear, this game takes patience. A lot of it. Understanding each monster is vital to the hunt. Knowing their moves, and predicting moments they will open up for a moment for a free hit. Timing is everything in this game, from dodging to striking. Practicing against monsters is key, and walking in expecting victory without experience against monsters is a bad idea. Every monster can punish a mistimed strike. 

In terms of weapons, the safer a weapon is to use, the less damage it typically does. The same applies to faster weapons. The faster a weapon, the less damage it deals. That's not to say speedy weapons are worthless, as taking advantage of this speed allows for faster weapons to hit when slower weapons may not. And the raw damage of the slower weapons means every hit counts.

In terms of armor, there is a wide variety of skills and abilities that permeate the game, allowing for broad variations of bonuses to fighting styles. Not to mention the armors themselves are very beautiful, I'm looking at you Gala Suit.

Overall, this is a game that thrills through learning and patience. Fighting a giant monster is all about making sure the strike falls when the monster won't be able to strike back, or in other words, knowing your opponent leads to victory
Love this game, it's an absolute gem with so much to do.

But the game's technical side is a fucking mess, Even with a 1080 this game struggles in certain areas, and 
it's prone to restart my computer in the middle of hunts and quests. Absolutely killing the mood.

Needs more optimization but the gameplay is gold.
Monster hunter? More like monster bullies!
Step 1: Gear up
Step 2: Sharpen your skills
Step 3: Bully the monsters, either alone or with your friends! (Except behemoth, in FF crossover behemoth bullies you & your friends!)
Step 4: Profit! (Or cry like a baby after being bullied by behemoth)
I've never played a monster hunter game before, and I didn't really know what to expect going into this game, but MAN did I have a blast playing it! Slaying monsters in this game offers a satisfaction unlike any other game. I’ve heard it described as an “easier Dark Souls”, and I tend to agree with that. It is certainly challenging, but not frustratingly so. I only occasionally died to any given monster more than once. You fight monsters, slay them, and build better armor from their body parts. Rinse and repeat! I’ll tell you right now: I RECOMMEND IT!

--- {Story} ---
The story in MHW is nothing to write home about, but I was actually surprised at the effort they put into it. It is lighthearted, whimsical, funny, and sometimes a tad awkward. But if you are playing MHW, you aren't playing it for the story. You can expect about 10% of the dialogue to be voiced, the remainder is conveyed via text boxes, your character doesn’t speak (although the game has one of the best character creation tools I’ve used).
--- {Gameplay} ---
The gameplay is simple on the surface, but complex as you learn more about each playstyle and weapon, monster abilities. Each weapon has a relatively limited number of combos compared to many other fighting games, but with 14 different weapon classes, there is plenty of options for a variety of playstyles, both melee and ranged. The hunts are meaningful, and engaging. There are a wide variety of monsters to hunt, each with their own unique move set. Definitely best played with a controller.
--- {Graphics} ---
Outstanding. The game looks beautiful and performance wise it runs like butter. There is a wonderful polish on this game that continually had me impressed. If you are running into performance issues, try reducing or disabling volumetric fog.
--- {Audio} ---
The music is engaging and weapon/monster sounds are well done. No complaints here
--- {Replay Value/Grind} ---
HIGH, if you plan to grind to get best gear and weapons after the story. The grind is much more fun with friends after you beat the main story, although I played the entire story solo. Plus, with the Witcher crossover event and dlc coming Autumn 2019, there will be plenty of fresh content coming this year.
--- {Game Time} ---
I would estimate that it is about 10-15 hours into the game before you’ve seen MOST of the tutorials introducing you to the various game systems. The main story took me 70 hours to beat, that was with doing all the “optional” quests one time. 
--- {Value} ---
Definitely worth $60 full price. You get plenty of hours out of it with just the story. It’s a steal if you get it on sale for anything less than $60.
--- {Bugs} ---
None that I noticed or were significant enough to remember. Sometimes my damn palico (cat helper) would just sit there and watch as I died instead of bringing me a health potion, but not sure if that is an AI issue or I wasn't getting some sort of hidden roll.
--- {Final Verdict} ---
9/10, would have cats make my meals any day.

Played Monster Hunter 2G and Monster Hunter 3G on my PSP before. Monster Hunter World gives both a nostalgic feel and a renowed sense of adventure as I encountered new monsters and learned new game mechanics. Love the new Expedition mode wherein it is essentially free roam of different regions. Can be played solo but is always more fun with friends.

Gameplay 10/10
Graphics 10/10
Multiplayer 10/10
Palico/Felyne 10/10
Was playing MH since 3G, played MH4U, MHG and emulated some of the old ones. And I still say this is the best MH you could ever wish for.

Though it could be better in a few places like: 
- The time wasted waiting for the end of quest timer.
- End of quest "Sigh of relief" animations should have the option to be disabled.
- The placement of the vendors being way too far from each other. (eg. going to the Forklift just for the Smith is annoying af)
- ik its a MH game but the prep before the hunt is a bit too repetitive after a while.

I only noticed these points after I played it again on PC (First time was on PS4). You probably wouldn't experience these negatives if this was your first playthrough.
A wonderful addition to the MH series. A great game for newbies of MH to pick up, although the difficulty curve can be a little steep. Nonetheless, nothing beats the feeling of a successful hunt.
[h1] Ahhhh Monster Hunter.....you have a very special spot in my heart. [/h1]
The go to monster hunting game that everyone should definitely Play.
I'm just gonna tell you the pros and cons to make it quick
[b] Pros [/b]
- Lots of Monsters that are memorable (obviously, but theres a catch)
- Awesome weapons (DB is Da Best)
- Fun combat (Each weapon has their own moveset meaning you can try any weapon you like the most)
- Armors and layered armors looks dope (i especially love they add the layered armors to hide that Blue Azure rathalos 
   helm and red rathalos mail xd)
- Fashion Hunter! (Not a lot of option but decent)
- [b] SKILL>SKIN [/b] (if youre using a full set of armor, then theres something wrong with you :/) (well unless its Drachen..)
- Dev keeps on giving Content! (Lots of awesome contents especially End game like the Arch Tempered Elder Dragons 
   quest, Collaborations, Events and plenty more) (Also ICEBORNE)
- Collaboration events are amazing (Ever want to hunt the Behemoth from Final Fantasy IX as Dante DMC?)
- High Replayabilty (depends on you tho)
- A somewhat Active community
- Lots of Builds for each weapons (Theres no Best Weapon or Best armor everything is situational and depends on the monster which i love) (ofcourse theres the META build)

[b] Cons [/b] 
- Story [spoiler] Wait theres a story? [/spoiler]
- Just keep grinding, keep grinding, keep grinding, keep grinding (honestly not surprising but this game RNG is soo shit [spoiler] Attack Jewel what is that?? [/spoiler])
- RNG MORE LIKE
  R No
  N [spoiler] Insert the material you really need here [/spoiler]
  G For you bitch
- Connection error, CONNECTION ERROR, [b] CONNECTION ERROR [/b] Capcom please, the last thing i want is to solo a Behemoth with 1 Cart left, and then CONNECTION ERROR)
- Cheating and modding is allowed apparently (now i know what are you thinking. why is it on Cons, well its more of a personal thing but i hate cheating. Its fine if your on your own but don't ruin other people experience for your Ego. Also don't flex when youre cheating)
- You kinda get burnt out after a while 
- Repetitive (if you are the kind of person who doesn't like to grind things then be prepared)

Alright thats all for now i'm gonna score the game when i get the Attack jewel sooooo i'll be gone for a while.........
Monster hunter has recently become one of my favorite sagas of all time, and world is just breathtaking. 

Graphics and monster design are at the peak of any MH game and the creatures feel truly alive. 

The music is beautiful and fitting to the world and situation (battles, hub, etc) 

There are 14 different weapons and each has a truly unique playstyle (like different classes you could say) at the time of writing this I've only played 5 types constantly at most and it's been more than enough to keep me having fun in more than 400 hours of gameplay. 

Game is easy to learn and hard to master, some weapons require more time to learn than others but overall they're all very well balanced.

The game is grindy as you need to kill the monsters multiple times in order to make armor and weapons and some materials are rarer than others (oh and decorations...) 
But when you find a weapon/playstyle you love grinding becomes fun, to the point where you kill monsters just to see how fast you can do it. 

The community is helpful and friendly overall (although I play solo most of the time) 

The game has so much content that is well worth the price and has many collaborations (Devil may cry, Megaman, Final fantasy and we will get Geralt bois!) 

I  totally recommend the game and hope to see you in the new world fellow hunter!
Amazing game! Writing this at roughly 300 hours of game play, if you're having troubles slaying monsters remembers to keep upgrading your weapons and armor look for builds and make sure to use decorations. very fun. just wish the PC version would catch up.
This is hands down one of the worst games I have ever played in my life. I have been all over the map. I've lost sleep, I've skipped meals, I've been fired from countless jobs. All because of this damn game. The sheer amount of hatred I have for this game has spilled over into every aspect of my life to the point where sleep is no longer the escape I crave but the nightmare I fear (because it is only nightmares). I open my eyes and this game is in front of me. I close them and I see Xeno'jiva. There is no escape. 10/10 would strongly recommend.
Been a long time fan of the series and this is by far the best entry. Can be a little grindy at times, but grinding in this game is a blast. The gameplay is fantastic and the visuals are stunning. Well worth the price, but I'd still recommend waiting for a sale to buy it.
Monster Hunter World is a bit easy game compare to console game line such as MHGENX and its previous versions.
There's only 2 outcome while playing this game. Either you get bored or get addicted and spend 10+ hours a day.

Only down side on this game is disconnection when connecting to other Online sessions. Other than that it's worth the time!
10/10, its not often I play 13 hours of a game in two days, and completely solo at that.  None of my friends were playing and I still got mad into it. 
(Mixed reviews are because of initial server issues that have been fixed)
I've played previous monster hunter games like the 4 Ultimate, but it felt like meh. But MH World is awesome! Loved the beautiful graphics, loved the combat movements(I'm very particular about martial arts and motion physics), loved the environments, loved the "un-partitioned" areas, loved the vast decoration customization, and many more. It's basically kinda like my dream game. I've been looking for games that I would really enjoy cuz' a lot of games (In this comment time) are mostly battle royale. I've played Fortnite, and after a while, it gets very repetitive and since every game starts with zero, I can't bring something that I can customize, so I felt that there is no progress(improving your character and whatnot). Then I found this, MHW, and fell in love with it. I'm glad I joined not long before the Anniversary Event, where all previous event quest become available.

With all that said, there are some negatives:
- The Monster Moster is Small. There are the easy ones(G.Jagras, Kulu, Diablos, Rath, etc) and there are some elders (Kusha, Vaal, Teo, Luna, Kirin, Zorah, Nergi, and Baby Xeno(literally just born)), and there's a raid for 16 people in 4 teams (Kulve Taroth). This will easily get repetitive for those who don't enjoy taking down the same monsters over and over again. And there's Behemoth :3 (a collaboration monster)

- The Weapons, ignore this if you don't want to spoil yourself cuz it made me sad when I realised this. The weapons are the same, the exact same sword patched with some monster skin, and call it a new sword. Unlike other MH games, every weapon is unique and there were ridiculous weapons like a pizza sword. I'm kind of a sword enthusiast, so this saddens me.

- Shared Carts, maybe this works for other MH as well, but it makes multiplayer stressful if you hunt for something like Behemoth, noobs will die and 3 times - you're out!, I wish they changed this so that if the carts ran out, the survivors can carry on and only the last carted will return to base. That way it won't affect the remaining proes who will probably finish the quest no problem. Because of this, a lot of proes prefer going solo.

- It's Kinda too Easy, once you get used to it or discovered the power of Cluster Bombs, it becomes really easy(for the not mentally challenged, I understand). I usually farm while watching Youtube anyway. So I do wish for more monsters like Behemoth, trying to beat that guy out for the first time was heck a lot of fun (I'm the kind of person who doesn't give up until I'm satisfied). But other than that, the Arch Tempereds are just....ok. Kinda feels like they normal ones should be that powerful from the start.

On the end note:
Despite the flaws, a lot of new contents are coming very slowly for free(I kinda feel wrong, cuz they need money to survive), like the Witcher 3 collab(already available on console), the Iceborne expansion with new icy place and monsters to add to the roster plus the Master Rank(basically G Rank, which a lot of pro players are craving for) and probably more collabs that Capcom are working on for MHW. And because of the success of MHW, they might add another expansion(the world map has plenty of room left :D) the year after Iceborne.
It is a great game that keeps its user intrigued for a long time while still being complicated enough to make you want to learn more about the game. Mhw is suited for anyone and your play style can be matched by any of the 14 weapons. 
Great Game
Wow wow wow....After seeing the reviews being "Mixed" I honestly held off on this game. I bought this during the lunar sale for $40.00, and I'm blown away at how amazing this game is.

I love this game, I had some help from friends understanding the basics, which was the only frustrating thing in the beginning. Once this drifted away, and I gave it time..I fell in love!!!!!

I love this game, my kids love this game...10/10 would recommend to anyone.
Best game for me by far. Nerve racking. It would nice to see those old monsters like Narcacuga or Tigrex. But overall best game in the series. Loving it
Got this game during Winter Sale. Never doubted to buy this game as I am an avid fan of Monster Hunter since it's started on PS2. Story was too short for me and I think monsters were too few. I hope on future updates, they should added more on Weapon Tree like additional Rarity up to 10+ and additional monsters. Adding 10 more would be fantastic! VERY RECOMMENDED GAME
I played this game when it released on xbox back over a year ago and I dont know where I'm going with this I'm doing this for a steam medal. It's a pretty good game I guess.

I want to like this game. It looks pretty, it plays pretty, I make pretty things out of dead things. But there's something missing that doesn't quite speak "Monster Hunter" to me.

There's an abundant of monsters missing for starters, even Tri for the Wii had a better selection, the monsters do make up in being crafty but lack in numbers. This is one of those times that quality did not beat quantity, because the monsters in other instalments were unique in their own right that it didn't feel like the same 5 monsters, it felt like 25. Even the azure, gold, crimson, silver, and all the other varients which looked like reskins (and basically were) had stats changed that made them feel different, where it changed from being weak to water to actually being weak to electricity and additionally had more health and did more damage to the player. 

As a result it feels weapons also suffered, with the lack of variety, just go big, don't put no thought into a build, I maxed maybe 3 weapons with Fire, Water, Electricity, because that's all you need to win. There's very few monsters that render a weapon difficult, like hammers? You can only buy hammers and be fine, rarely have to worry about knockback if you max it and get blue or white sharpness on it. Agnaktor called, and it's laughing at how a Uragaan doesn't deflect like it use to. Anyone remember the fatalis, or silver rathalos, or nakarkos that would legit deflect 95% of attacks unless you had white/purple sharpness? The step up weapons have is compared to generations, my god, I'm so happy a great sword can do 1k base damage and a sword and shield does 300, and not both doing 250 damage at maxed level like generations had them do.

Multiplayer while in the hub is a bit odd at first since you join people, but it still follows the traditional "everyone ready up and the host will start the quest", I know there's a small guild area but I think it would have been sexy if other people joined in one city instead. Similar to how you joined a guild hall or in Tri an actual city where you interact with other players. Again i know, small guild area, but meeting people in town would have been more appealing to the "grouping" narrative.

I do think SOS was a smart move, so was carrying over mounting, grappling hooks, being able to change equipment (even though I never use it) and even fast travel. I do miss old tracking styles but this new one is fresh. You'll probably learn to track the monster without it since you have to fight it over and over again not because you want it's parts (maybe you do) but because it's such a small roster of large monsters. The way potions are used, excellent, part of it use to be a perceptive skill where you had to plan to stay still, now you get a bit of a walk while chugging,

I miss alot of the old stuff but if you never touched a monster hunter, this is a good place to start, it's easier and dumbed down, I want them to add monsters, to add areas if possible, not just events or rare sighting, but more armors and weapons, make this game explode. I put in so little time into the game and I feel done because there's no G rank, there's little merit to maxing this game where other games I put over 750 hours easily for every monster scenario. I recommend the game to new and old players, but I know it can be better not just pretty.
Great game, a fully worthwhile installment in the Monster Hunter series. Beautiful, groundbreaking in many ways, etc, etc. But god DAMN did they fuck up late game. The droprate odds are like lottery for getting what you need - just read comments about monster hunter anywhere to see for yourself - a pretty important issue that the player has no control over.

Worse yet, all of the archtempered and high leveled **Free DLC** monsters kill you in one hit - literally one hit - unless you dedicate your entire build to mitigating them, or the aforementioned fucked droprates have blessed you with the specific gem/material set you need to beat the monster you're fighting.

These Devs have no fucking clue how to handle difficulty, or allow for creativity with builds.

Don't get me wrong, they built in a decent number of customization options, but only 1/50th of them are viable when it counts.

Devs, take your heads out of your asses - give the archtempered monsters new moves, that escalate as the battle goes on - as opposed to solely pumping their HP and damage numbers through oblivion with egregious disregard for the casual player.

I mean, it's a good game for a hundred hours or more. So I'm going to recommend this game to others. But let it be known that the fuck ups I've mentioned were so frustrating, it made this conflicted endorsement a difficult choice.

This is the kind of shit that makes me doubt moneyed big-wigs are play testing their products anymore.

Oh. And for fuck's sake stop making monsters that can ONLY be beaten multiplayer. Not everyone has friends that play this game, and those that don't are at the mercy of another lottery system - teammates that die vs. don't die.

I attempted to fight the behemoth (regular, not even archtempered) at least 20 times in the last 2 weeks, and ~18/20 times my teammates failed the quest for me.

I have promised myself I wouldn't partake in this criminally flawed late game many times now, but as some of you might know, it's incredibly difficult to concede defeat to a video game (even one that's completely broken). I had a lot of fun following the main story, then even up to Hunter Level 100, but beyond that the experience purely suffocating.

To clarify, I'm a souls' series veteran. I love a challenge. This (late game) is not a challenge. This is all but impossible without the right gems and/or teammates. Even Korean speedrunners have to equip a magic cape that automatically dodges every attack for you to make it through these fights solo.

Fucking fix it.
My first foray into Monster Hunter games after wanting to try them for ages. It has been an excellent experience and I can't wait to play more in the series if it comes to PC. 

A plethora of combat options and a world that truly feels alive. Every monster is a joy to learn its weaknesses and take to school with your weapon of choice. The beasts all feel like they really occupy space and have weight behind all of their attacks. Everything is difficult without being cheesy. I am told this game has the least options and is the most watered down of the Monster Hunter games but for a new player, you would never know it. 

If you ever wanted to play something like Dark Souls but against giant monsters and nothing else, this is your game. 

As a mostly PC player, I played the whole game with a mouse/keyboard without any issues at all. The controls felt responsive and fluid and I never felt hindered by my control choice. The menu options aren't ideal for mouse/keyboard but you get used to them fast enough. 

My only gripe is that I wish there was a way to turn any armor into a 'layered' armor set as by the end of the game, most armors are rendered obsolete which limits the ability to play a version of fashion souls as you might do with Dark souls. 

Change the town music.

Kill the handler.
The game is good. The controls might be an issue for some.

Having to press three to four buttons to hoist and take out a weapon is absurd. If the developers change the way the controls work in the next game, it'll be a masterpiece.

Overall, the game is absolutely worth it full price. So many options to choose between weapon (although clunky), armor, and cosmetics. 

DLC's are so-so.. they're all cosmetics: stickers, emotes, and costumes (for your handler). Some DLC's are free.
I absolutely love this game. Everything you do just makes you feel like an absolut badass. Granted, a bit more variety in terms of monsters would be nice, but that will hopefully remedied when Iceborn comes out.
Also, i haven't had any problems with bugs of any kind in quite a while, so as it stands this game seems very stable.
As a MH fan since freedom unite i really like this game. Too bad ive lost 10 hours of progress to it breaking my graphics card mid hunt multiple times making me not want to play. Trust the minimum requirements kids and don't do drugs.
I always wanted to try out a Monster Hunter game, but never had the proper console to do so. Now I, too, get to enjoy the thrill of whacking screaming murder lizards with a massive bone hammer.

Handler, stay the F*** away from my cat or so help me I will end you.
Monster hunter world is one of the greates adventuregames out there. The grind of Diablo, the gameplay of the Witcher and The never ending "I hate this game, i love this game!" feeling.
The mp is a bit clonky, not actual gameplay but finding ppl, joinin sessions (wich you DC from sometimes) and The annoying fact that you cant join someone elses Hunt if they havet watched the cutscene.
That all aside its still a Great game, so freaking fun playing with friends and worth every buck.
Great Game did not have any issues with having my mates with me in mission and combat is not to easy or too hard, and its cool battling monsters !! nothing more to say Great game in my book
My first Monster Hunter game and I adore it. Dense though. Youtube is your friend for this game - as a lot of things are poorly explained, or sometimes glossed over in their entirety. I can kind of understand though, 'cause there's an entire catalogue of games that have continually added more and more layers to the series over the years. To avoid being overly front-loaded it's instead kind of vague and unhelpful with some things. Don't be afraid to look up how the various systems work, and especially weapon tutorials. None of the weapons are fully explained in game (via your manual or the training area) and some of them have moves that are pretty core elements of their play-style that aren't listed anywhere in-game.

Absolutely worth the plunge though.
Been playing this series since Freedom 2, and will continue to play, its well worth the price you pay for this game. Heaps of QOL improvements and plenty of fun to be had.
As a longtime Monster Hunter fan, this as grindy and satisfying as the previous games while introducing many quality-of-life improvements that set it apart, apart from the incredible graphics and animations, of course. 
Weapon designs could have used more variety, and there are fewer monsters than previous outings. Here's hoping the expansion addresses those. 
Highly recommend.
this game is fun, i do recommend it. But, the UI design is horrible, most horrible of any games i've played in the last few years, it takes away too much time to scroll through things, finding items and info. other than that, i think it's good.
One of the best games I've ever played. As a fan of Monster Hunter since the first game on the PS2, I love how far the franchise has come. I'm looking forward to more monsters.
Pretty good port that manages to maintain reasonable amout of fps with eye candying graphics. As for a game it's very advanced in its gameplay, tons of combos to master, weapons and armors to craft as well as gem skills to obtain guaranteed. You'll easily get into whether you enjoy grinding gear during long sessions with friends. One thing I don't like is repetiveness but perhaps that's just me who can't be hooked into mmo simply. It's still being updated with free content and big expansion on the horizon although sadly the pc's updates are releasing way too late compared to console version. Still worth checking out.
Alright boys I''m not gonna lie, I've probably invested more time than I should've in this game. But I gotta say this is one of the only games that I have actually bothered to stick to at all.
- You literally cannot stop playing.
- Each time you open this game is 5 hours+ of gameplay.
- Even without friends, SOS system in this game is good enough to help you in the hunt.
- Is it worth the money? Totally yes.
I have never invested 1100 hours of my time playing a game except for Monster Hunter: World. NEVER. This game is so good and addictive that I would spend another thousand of hours into slaying, capturing and grinding giant monsters. Unfathomable dept of game mechanics, free DLC's, events and updates, great multiplayer and community. You can also play solo through all the main story and quests, or join other's hunts.
Pros: 
-Great game to start with if you're new and interested in the franchise

-Great soundtrack, each monster battle feels different and unique from each other from the battle theme alone

-Vast open and seamless maps unlike older MH games where entering another zone pops up the loading screen

-Don't like the way your armor looks? There's Layered Armor which is basically the game's transmog and god do they look great. My personal favourite being the Gala Suit and the Skull Mask

-The collaboration events which add even more to the end-game experience, from bringing back Deviljho, to Devil May Cry Dante's layered armor, and fighting the Behemoth from Final Fantasy IV. Best part of all, they are all FREE!

-MODS! If you're ever bored or burnt out from playing the game, go browse some mods to enhance your MHW experience. There are lots of amazing quality-of-life and cosmetic mods which will surely add a few more hours to your total playtime

Cons:
-Lacking in number of large monsters compared to older MH games (also lacking in "cool-looking" monsters when compared to older MH titles, I'm looking at you Jyuratodus)

-Also besides the lack of cool-looking monsters, there is also a lack of cool-looking weapons when compared to older titles. Capcom's reason being they want the weapons in World to look "realistic" but in the end, most of what we get are dull looking weapons which do not give the impression of "Hey, I just crafted this end-game weapon after trying to defeat this monster over a hundred times" and it looks more like polished scrap

-No 'real' tutorial when it comes to helping players learn the game, eg; Breaking certain monster parts, how to capture a monster, benefits of slaying vs capturing a monster, completing bounties, using your environment, I can go on and on. TL;DR, there is so much depth in MHW which I feel is essential for every hunter to learn when playing the game and the game doesn't do quite a good job and teaching players what they should know

-Besides the obvious name being "Monster Hunter", there really isn't a whole lot to do once you're done hunting the monsters you need to craft the gear you want. The only ways I can think of if you're looking to fight back monsters you've already fought before just for the sake of fun are either do speedruns or just fight naked

-PC players get updates much more behind schedule compared to console players who already done such content months before PC players. So if you have already seen such events already on console, have patience for such content to come to PC. It may be later than consoles but it doesn't mean we won't be getting them. On the bright side, MODS!

Verdict: 8/10. It is my personal Game of The Year for 2018 and I would still add hundreds of hours more into this game. I look forward to seeing how Iceborne will shape up MHW. Until then, happy hunting!
This game is amazing

with 200 plus hours in game i can safely say without a shadow of a doubt that you should get mhw.

pros:
-plethora of weapons that you can master and main
-active as hell developers that release updates and FREE expansions (ice born) and a witcher 3 cross over that's slated to come to pc soon
-fun combos that feel satisfying as hell to pull off

cons:
-its very grindy
-you can get tired of the game quickly if you don't switch up weapons or play style
-its almost impossible to play as best you can with the keyboard so a controller is needed

all in all, get this game on sale, it goes on sale all the time and is worth all the time you might put into the game. 
Happy Hunting!
Hi guys,
i purchased MHW late in 2018 (around Christmas) so the starting difficulties/bugs/etc. were already gone i guess. I've played roughly over 110h so far. I was worried a lot since the game got a lot of negative reviews in the beginning. I can't support this view at all. Let's go to the procon-list overview:

+ Immersive world (maps, setting and even the story)
+ story (for a MH game this is quite impressive compared to MH Generations on the 3DS)
+ weapons and armor  (i liked the crafting tree concept a lot since u have to get back to smaller monsters later in the game to craft high class weapon you haven't thought about a long the first progression)
+ group gameplay (hot join option is a big advantage for the MH series!)
+ controls (I've treated myself with a usb controller which works perfectly fine, can*t judge about mouse+keyboard tho)

++ Bosses (nothing ever seen close to the awesomeness of the bosses, anyway i missed the astalos a lil bit but maybe it comes in the upcoming addon)
++ comfort options (boss encyclopedia, the plant and bug growing guy, the melting lady i dont want to miss this anymore!)

0 music (my gf says the soundtack from mhgen was more catchy)

- Actually nothing comes to my mind related to this kind of game. You get what you pay for. Not more nor less.

So far im very pleased with the experienced i gained in MHW. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes challenging boss fights and a lil bit of grinding. Don't play this if you get frustrated easily. But still for low skills players this game can be learned and completed quite easy.

Thanks for reading my review. Greets
I love this game. This was my vote for Steam's 2018 game of the year. 

Up until my 80th gameplay hour I played this game entirely in Windows. Then I started to play it in Ubuntu 18.04 LTS via Steam Play. Since then I've only been playing it in Linux. It works very well in Linux. The only issue I have is occasional freezing. The freezes only happen once every few hours, so it's not frequent enough to make it a deal breaker. Other than that it works perfectly fine.

It did take a little bit of effort to get it working. If you'd like to play the game in Linux too, here is a video of what I had to do to get it working in Ubuntu: https://youtu.be/EQO646RDEq8
I never got into Monster Hunter in the past. I always liked the concept, but it always seemed over complicated to me. I decided to give MHW a try after a coworker had talked so highly of it. I'm glad I did! There is a LOT in this game. But it's explained very well and is a lot of fun. The creatures and environments are very creative and exciting. It's easy to get lost in this game for a long time. Preparing for hunts, learning how to best use each type of weapon, crafting better armor and weapons, going on expeditions to collect gear for improving gear and so on. The feeling of finally conquering a beast is quite rewarding and gets you pumped for the next hunt. I highly recommend even if you've never played a Monster Hunter before!
Amazing game but again we have either a lazy port from Capcom or evidence they just do not understand the PC platfrom.

Key issues you can expect:
- No option to disable DOF
- No option to disable Motion blur
- No option to disable or adjust Bloom
- No option to adjust FOV
- No option to rebind buttons for Controllers
- Very limited Antialising
- Limited granulatiy in other graphics settings
- No 21:9 Screen Ratio support
- Bugged Full Screen support
- Bug of High Resolution Textures not loading at max settings
- Bug of Screen Space Reflections not displaying but still consuming system resources
- Bugged DOF Distance Detection causing erratic blur on objects that should be in focus
- Rediculous number of Menu Layers
- Bad Connection Stability causing frequent drop outs and disconnections from server even when playing solo
- Awkward Multiplayer Lobby arrangement
- Bonus complaint, No Nargacuga :-P

Other than that the game is fantastic. But given the console version sold millions of copies and they had an extra 9 months of development to get the port right there is really no excuse for any of the above. Plus connection issues will ruin your multiplayer experience... And it is Monster Hunter World, not monster hunter sit alone in the corner. Capcom has the money and resources to fix this with minimal investement. They can have a thumbs up when they do so.

Edit (20/9/18): A recent patch has removed this item from the list:
- No option to disable Mouse Acceleration
So at least we are seeing some progress and it is a big ticket item. But it took them a month, nothing else has been touched and a notable number of people are reporting crash on launch issues after installing the patch. But it is something. Hopefully the level of support will increase as we go forward.

500h MHF2//3000h MHFU//200h MHTri//400h MHP3rd//1000h MH3U//2000h MH4U//100h MHX(generations)

[b]Pros:[/b]
+It's a Monster Hunter game. On PC.
+Great animations and visuals in general. 
+Weapons seem to be well balanced in comparison to prior titles.
+Less tedium. Especially when gathering.
+No loading times between map areas (about time)
+Highly customizable loadouts, item belt settings, etc.
+Good tutorials. Nice for beginners.
+Combat is tons of fun. Albeit a bit crazy sometimes.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-Menu navigation, Just awful. Much more awful than in previous titles. I am especially triggered by the book animation that is played when browsing quests EVERY SINGLE TIME. (I know about the speed up)
-Lack of graphical options. Motion blur and DoF need to be optional.
- No option to disable the annoying af scout flies. I am not blind nor stupid. I can find gathering spots without it. Please don't clutter my screen.
-Hilariously bad optimization. Srsly, considering the looks of the game, it runs like garbage. Get 2+ ppl with elemental weapons and watch any NASA PC spew out 30 fps on average during combat. No matter the settings. It's unforgiveable for a multiplayer game.
-Speaking of which, reduce the special effects and particles in combat situations. Spares my eyes and boosts fps. ez win/win.
-Everything about the multiplayer. Getting a group on a PSP using x-link kai was more straightforward. This is a ~cOnNecTeD eXpErIenCe~ I never imagined to feel this lonely in. It's impossible to get a pub group going. Everyone just  SOS flares and then disbands because it's the only half decent way to get multiplayer. I really miss setting up a room and taking turns with ppl picking quests.
-Chat system. Why is it so hard to access? Why are NPC dialogues, progress notifications and other junk displayed in the same screen area? Let me press "y" and fucking chat. I don't want to navigate through 3 menues to say something. 
-Can't see hunters in headquarters. And nobody is in the gathering hall. Ever.
-Network errors are far too common.
-Where are the 200k ppl playing? I never see more than ~20 lobbies (with mostly 1-2 player in each) REGARDLESS OF THE FILTER SETTINGS. WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE?????
-Unskippable cutscences. Spare me those. I know how to play MH.
-Too easy, aka where is my fucking G-Rank?. I roll everything solo with the iron tree weapons and don't even care about the skills.
-Sound system. Maybe it's me, but after trying several ingame settings, everything sounds muddy and indistinctive in my DT770's.

[b]Conclusion:[/b]
There is so much more I'd like to add but chances are, nobody reads it ayways. So a few last sentences:
I am pretty disillusioned. What they did for 6 months porting the game is inexplicable to me. It can't be (performance) optimization for PC, that's for sure. The antiquated UI and menus are impractical and tedious to navigate. You need strong willpower to explore the many options given. 
Abandon all hope at CAPCOM fixing anything. That would be foolish to assume given their track record. 

For diehard MH fans a must buy. For everyone else, not so much. The game gets bad reviews for a reason.
----------------------------Edit-----------------------------
I hope you guys can understand what It takes to leave a negative review for this game. As someone who waited for the pc version for literally 10 years. Because from the very beginning I was convinced that playing on 400 x 240 pixels screen with 30 fps doesn't do this gorgeous game justice. 
And when it finally happened, even though I love the franchise to death, I cannot turn a blind eye to the many issues it has.
Sure some of them are nitpicked. But it adds up. And they do add up fast.
You want to hunt monsters with your friends ?
[h1]Connection failed.[/h1]
You can't kill a monster and want help from other players ?
[h1]Error code: 83-MW1[/h1]
You gave up asking for help and just want to try it solo for the 6th time ?
[h1]Error code: 50382-MW1[/h1]

What ? Just because you paid for it, you think you can play it anytime you want ? No. You can play it whenever WE want. And if we're feeling good, we might even let you go on a quest with your friends. Maybe. We might change our opinion and kick you out in the middle of the quest though. 

Oh ? You have a perfectly good OC'd CPU ? Yeah, no. I won't let you launch it. It's a 3 years old CPU, you better upgrade. Why ? Well those good folks at Denuvo gave us amazing BJ's so we'll go with them instead of doing what our customers want. If you don't like it, don't play it. Whoops I forgot, you can't play it anyway.

We might fix the servers sometime, maybe next month. But Denuvo is here to stay, f¨k you and your opinion. We paid like 300.000€ from our server budget to Denuvo, it'll surely drop the piracy and generate us even more income !

Oh and we heard someone asking for PC related options like motion blur and depth of field. Honestly, adding 3 lines of codes is just too much work. we might do it later. Next month maybe.

EDIT: They've pretty much fixed everything I talked about in this review. Kudos to the devs. The second they remove that Denuvo DRM, I'll change my review.
I played this game over 700 hrs already and I really enjoy this game, seriously I really do and I would like to recommend this game for other people who like monster hunting game. One thing that really disappoint me is connection issues, In 2018 they solve this problem until mid January, then here we go again with people getting disconnected in the middle of the quest (for me I cant even join a session).. I will keep this comment until CAPCOM really do their job to solve this problem, this issue is really annoying and I already lose my appetite to play this game.
I have such mixed feelings with this, but now it's reached a point where I feel like I've seen most of what I am going to get from this game. I'll keep it short and simple, my thoughts don't reflect the series as I don't know the series - this is my first go with it. I tried to play with friends, and first few missions were great.. however when you get to a point where you are 40 minutes into doing something, and for whatever reason the connection cuts out.. for f*.... it is beyond annoying, it's painful. So you lose progress and then have to do it all again.. there is only so many times I can do that, I'm sorry. I gave this title plenty of time in hope to stop these issues before I picked it up, but it looks like it is still rampant. I feel like I'm doing the same thing over and over, and I got tired of it fairly quick. Monster variation and some dynamics in the game are fantastic, but I don't like the general combat mechanisms. I feel this could have been a mind blowing game, but for now I am left with a bad view of it. I rarely keep hold of games that I don't recommend, but I would like to give this a go again later in the year to see if anything has changed. For now though it is an unfortunate thumbs down.
overall this game is bad in my opinion ... I experienced a crash of at least 3x in one day and the connection issue is very Suck and make Frustating when I was hunting.
If time could be repeated I would never buy this failed game.
3/10 for this GAME
As someone who loves co-op, I cannot in good faith recommend this game until they resolve the connection issues. The sheer amount of enjoyment this game provides is spectacular with a unique combat system and game mechanics unique to the Monster Hunter genre. Easily a strong contender for a top game of all time, but they HAVE to FIX the netcode. If you're someone looking for a game with an in-depth monster hunting mechanic and deep gameplay mechanics, this is certainly the game for you. Just play it like you did the other Monster Hunter's and keep it offline till they get their ducks in a row unless you have friends on a LAN (and even then there will be disconnects).

I am constantly getting disconnected and having to fend off a game that balances when people join, but does not revert back once they disconnect so you're left fighting a monster for 3x the time in a fight you already put 10 minutes into. Any time you forget about disconnecting issues and the team you random dropped in with is coordinating and dominating the monster. All of a sudden you will be grabbed and violently shook back to reality as the monster and the host stand still for 50 seconds and you are left in an empty game with a 4 person monster to kill. Fix the netcode. Having to play single player to avoid this is asinine, and hosting your own game ends up with people just dropping off and leaving you with an uneven spread of difficulty and your friends unable to rejoin because when someone drops out, their slot is unable to be refilled. 

No amount of setting steam to udp/tcp or setting transmission packet speed, leaving your program in borderless window & not alt tabbing will resolve your disconnect issues. Do not waste your time. Seeing how Capcom is on the comeback with PC ports like on RE:2, I'm fairly confident they'll resolve this at some point, but that time is not right now.
I really hate that I have to write a negative review about this game, but here we go I guess.
 
TL;DR: For a Monster Hunter game I think it definitely could’ve been done better. It’s not a terrible game by any means, but I would wait until it goes on sale. Also maybe have a pal or two to play it with for the sake of your sanity.
 
This game helps newcomers to the franchise by explaining old and new mechanics through a ridiculous amount of tutorials that you can’t skip and will be showing themselves again at random even when you’re hundreds of hours into your playtime. Also, make sure you have your character the way you want them to be (or make damn good use of that free edit voucher you get), because a lot of the customization aspects aren’t changeable once you complete the character. And you can’t even change your character’s name with the voucher; you have to use third party programs to do so. I will say though it definitely has a lot more quality of life improvements than the other games. The scoutflies will guide you to a track or even the monster itself (when they decide to work), you can leave food at the canteen to cook while you’re away, you can grow most of the stuff you would ever need for crafting with the ancient tree (and meld the rest that you can’t grow), and there’s even a nice training room that lists your combos that you can use to practice smacking barrels with your weapons. I just wish that the scoutflies didn't force your camera controls away from you and direct it in some arbitrary direction that isn't even towards the monster half of the time. 
 
I’ve seen people complain about the game having a rampant cheater problem which I haven’t come across too often. My only experiences with this were seeing arena clear times that were clearly impossible to accomplish and seeing somebody fighting an arch-tempered Teostra with a hunter rank of 999 (which could very well still be legitimate, it’s just the only HR999 I’ve seen on this game so far).
 
My biggest problem with this game is the lack of longevity. You can circumvent this to some extent by switching up your weapon in order to add more variety, or even go on a collectathon and make all of the gear and weapons you could possibly want. There’s even the endemic life that you can collect that will unlock a nice guild card background that you can use once you catch all of the animals. However in terms of actual hunting content this game is rather weak compared to the other MH games I’ve played. I almost exclusively play gunlance (with some hunting horn mixed in) and have never had an issue with getting bored with it or finding things to do in other games because of G-rank or playing with friends. But it just feels like there isn’t a lot to do at endgame. Or, at least, the endgame ENDS way too quickly for me. The Appreciation Fest that was going on was a good way of playing more content because they added most of the old event quests in, but with that gone now there isn’t much to do than farm the rotating event quests as much as humanly possible.

A quick side note since I mentioned G-rank... Why didn't the game just ship with it? The fact that they're putting it out as paid DLC later on and renaming it to "master rank" (ugh) kinda gives me a bad vibe about what they plan to do with it... Anyways, moving on.
 
As of right now the only thing I’m doing is farming for miniature and giant crown monsters to fill out the last two achievements on my guild card, but past that I don’t know what else I’d do. There is always Kulve Taroth once she comes back in the next event because her weapon drops are complete RNG (though I was fortunate enough to get one of her rarity 8 gunlances before she left) so there’s potentially hundreds more hours there because her drop pool is so huge.

Speaking of RNG, the drop rates in this game have definitely increased quite a bit. This is to the joy of many new and veteran MH players, and the despair of others. While farming for a monster gem for potentially dozens, if not hundreds, of hours may not sound like a grand time, it was definitely a bulk of my hours before. Now if I need a gem from Nergigante or Deviljho I can easily get it within an hour. Hooray. I was able to make my armor and weapons quicker… now what?
 
Hunting with friends is another big source of entertainment. Not only can you help each other get what you need from a monster or to finish hunts you haven’t completed yet, but there tends to be a lot of wacky stuff that happens when there’s more than one hunter involved. It’s always a good feeling when your friend accidentally (or intentionally) upswings you at just the right time and you mount the monster with a mid-air attack. But with multiplayer comes lots of frustration (who would’ve thought?) I tend to stick with my group of friends that are actually good at the game, but I’ve had more times than I care to admit where I will either answer an SOS flare (or fire one myself) and have somebody join and immediately triple-cart because they came in not knowing what they were doing. I guess that’s nothing new, but it’s worth mentioning. Also, the multiplayer monster scaling can be annoying. Once another player joins the monster’s health scales 2.6x. That may not be horrible unless you’re fighting an arch-tempered monster. At that point it becomes a giant pain and it becomes much more viable to hunt these solo. It’s easier to fight the hardest monsters in the game alone... that statement hurts a bit.

Lastly, I can’t comment on the mouse and keyboard controls because I play with a controller, but I’ve been told that they’re absolutely godawful. 10/10 best port.
 
I don’t hate this game (though I’m sure my review says otherwise), but there are a few changes here and there that couldn’t hurt. Maybe things will get a bit better once the DLC comes, or even before then if we’re lucky. At least there’ll be more to do.
This game is pretty amazing, and it's great fun with some friends, but it has some problems that make me hate it. The servers are absolute utter trash, probably 30% of my missions will load in and then just disconnect me a few minutes in. Sometimes it will get stuck searching for sessions or quests forever. In expeditions (world free roam) monsters will just up and fucking leave in the middle of a fight, ruining the point of even trying to kill them. Capcom has also loaded up a full $60 game with microtransactions, which should be illegal. The hitboxes on some enemy attacks could use some work, I've looked back at recordings showing an attack clearly missing me, still killing, which is a little annoying. When searching for players to join missions, most of the time it will fail to join the quest because it won't remove the quest from view when it is full.

Overall, game is loads of fun and I would recommend it, but capcom dropped the ball on servers and the god damn microtransactions. It just feels unpolished and needs more quality of life changes, which is a shame because they will probably never fix it.
Can I call back for money ?
This game is really a good game. But one thing that pissed me off is connection issue.
IF YOU GUYS CAN'T DO SUCH A THING THEN MAKE THIS GAME FOR SOLO PLEASE.
I Uninstalled this game. For fuck sake I've got killed so many time by Azure Rathalos with his Infinite Enrage Mode in arena.
This is a great game overall, but the PC controls and "difficulty" level are broken as all hell. This game makes fights difficult by outrageous monster health and constant staggering attacks that make fights last so long you get bored. Great graphics, great world, great idea - horrible execution. The levelling system is a joke, fight too hard for you? Eat a bunch of food and potions and pray to the gods you get lucky because you get nothing for levelling up but possibly better gear. Its just a broken loop which was obviously never play tested on the PC port.
went into this not thinking it was an MMO. boy howdy, was that unfortunate. this game is grindier than a stripper a giving you a lap dance with a chainsaw in her snatch. not to mention the brutally dumb matchmaking system, took me and my friend like an hour to figure out how to play in the same lobby. but it's okay, cuz once we finally got into the same game, we spent about 15 minutes chasing a monster and about 3.57 minutes fighting it, interspersed with cooking and eating food and/or sharpening my weapon ad nauseam. at the end of the day, if i wanted to spend my time and money on chasing something, i'd just play a racing game. smiley face.
God awful co-op functionality. The game was advertised with a heavy co-op focus but to play the story through we have to:
navigate 50 menus to invite friend to hub (that they don't actually appear in?)
start mission alone
track down monster
watch custscenes
send out 'SOS'
friend has to navigate 50 menus to find SOS
joins, has to run through the whole area to find me
kill boss
sent back to non-social hub separately
start process all over again
navigate 50 menus

Totally backwards design, we spent over an hour trying to work this out, resorted to google (really should never have to do this). There seem to be lots of fans about praising the game and suggesting workarounds i.e. both players watch custscenes separately at same time, then quit, restart and join each other - you should NEVER have to do this! It's downright poor design and the game does not really specify on which missions/ when the multiplayer will work. Capcom have made plenty of games with great co-op in the past (looking at the Resi games), how is their 'flagship' co-op game so uncooperative?

If you're buying it with your friends hoping to have a co-op adventure, don't buy this game. You have to progress every quest solo to a point where a cutscene will occur, so you can't have one continous long gameplay with your friends.


Quite possibly the most immersive hunting experience out there; play for two hours and you'll find yourself as exhausted as you'd be if you were actually trudging through thick undergrowth. This is because of the game's sludgy controls. Controlling your hunter feels as bulky as maneuvering a 1971 Lincoln Continental around along the murky bottom of your nearest river. And that's *with* mud, junk, and whatever other detritus is down there.

Monster Hunter: World wears its Japanese design around its neck like a millstone. Doing anything, going anywhere, involves instancing. Venturing into its "open world" requires "registering" with your hunter's partner. You have to *ask* the game for a special "open world" session, called an "expedition". It reminds me of stories I used to hear about cosplaying in Japan. I don't know if it's true or not, but I've been told that cosplay in Japan is "reserved" for certain areas, locked away in assigned rooms or gyms; cosplayers don't have the open-world freedom they have here in the US or Canada. That's very much what Monster Hunter: World feels like. It feels like the designers had a burning need to loom over your shoulder and control every second of your gameplay experience. Someone clearly had anxieties about giving the player too much freedom in the world, like an alcoholic soccer mom with OCD whose daughter just turned sixteen and got a car. MH:W is the over-controlling parent from hell.

I guess sometimes playing games is hard work. Like, backbreaking. Worse than yard work. But those games aren't for me, especially when yard work is actually more rewarding.

5/10.
I really could not get past the awful controls for this game on the PC.  There is no way to get true mouse input, that is without acceleration or input lag.  The animations are slow, the interface and controls are confusing.  

It might be a good game, but I couldn't finish the first quest.  It is a console game through and through.  Mouse and keyboard players should stay away.  I wish I could have my money back.
I don't know what I was excepting, probably a more brighter dark souls with more grind, less but bigger enemies and crafting.
Maybe it is, but there's an aspect of the game that prevented me from experiencing it because I just couldn't bear it for more than two hours. 

By the emperor... the characters in this game are annoying and cringy.
These kinds of characters are (probably?) to be expected from a japanese developer but I underestimated how long you have to endure them until you get into the grind/craft/progress loop.

So by all means, this is very subjective but it's a warning to all who are not really into japanese characters.

Not worth £50 at the moment, i've played 135 hours which 60% was responding to SO and other 30% figuring out what the heck is what, not much of the content, maybe later on but for now i think its worth hardly £15. Game is good, fun to play but yeah, content is very veeeeeeeeeeery low/short. Game for about 20 hours, for now tho. I can't put thumbs down or up, it's good but short, for now coz i have no options i'd say no.
Take my review with a grain of salt: My first Monster Hunter game, "only" played 30 hours, I may be against "grind games" and may not get/appreciate this whole genre of games. 

Pro's: Pretty and highly polished, fun cuteness and well designed perky interactions to make you feel positively reinforced (dings, shiny new armor, neat inventory system). Gorgeous environments. Had no crashes. 

Con's: This game traps you in a metaphorical box. I have not even begun to scratch the surface of how grindy this must become later-on, but I'm already exhausted. Fights are not challenging, just filler to extend time. They come in different pretty shapes ("Monsters"), but in the end, it's all the same. I don't even have to need to kill a monster a second time, the first kill of a new monster is already grindy and uninteresting to me. 
Also: Story not good enough, designed to be accessible and acquiesce a broad mass. 

I bought this on sale. Now I wish I hadn't spent that money. 

If the combat and gameplay loop makes you feel good, this game may be epic for you. Again, everything is very pretty and polished. 
My problems are with what happens behind the scenes, so to speak, the meta interaction between the player and the gameplay loop. Apparently this is a trope, but I really thought: This game is not respecting my time.
Fought this game for about 3 hours trying to get it run right on my triple monitors. Shouldn't have to fight games to get them to run right, especially when they are being sold at a premium like this one is. I had plenty of other performance issues as well. Just not worth it to me. 

I'm running a 6850k @ 4.2Ghx and a 1080ti @ 1999Mhz
It's a decent if grindy stand-in for Dark Souls that you can and probably should play solo
Don't bother trying to get anything approaching end-game done online, netcode is utter garbage

This would be a positive review if you could group reliably, but you can't, and if you don't like your time being wasted like that in an already inherently grindy timesink of a game, play alone or stay away
It was meh. I didn't enjoy it because it was mindless and just kill stuff. I wouldn't recommend it. But at the same time I can see how people who just want to get online and kill stuff would enjoy it. Just saying though, wasn't for me.
Until they fix a lot of the bugs, this game is HOT GARBAGE. Unskippable cut scenes that you are forced to view to play with friends. Wish I hadn't given it this long of a chance so I could get my fucking money back.
After beating it, i'm still struggling with whether to recommend. In the end though, two words describe every single aspect of the game: half-done.
The storyline is mediocre at best, and short. It comes so close to being amazing, then gives up halfway through.
The combat tries really hard to be incredible, but the controls aren't as fluid as the devs probably think they are. What's more fun, monsters will sit there and scream over and over again, so you just sit and go nowhere, and before you can move they hit you, then they hit you again, and in a solid 8-10 seconds of not being able to act, you die. 
Now, many people will disagree and say "bruh just don't get hit lol" and they are correct. that's why they branded it "souls-like." But, its extreme crap that monsters can miss you by five feet and still take you out. Vaulting over a monster that's charging at you doesn't exist in this game, even if you clear it by a mile.
Long story short, the weapons are fun, the game is fun, and i enjoyed it. However, there is almost zero content, what content there is is wildly, hilariously repetitive, and for a skill-based game, it's very focused on having the right gear, traps and consumeables. Even if you have all those things, monsters will sometimes attacks in ABSURDELY rapid succession, and you just flat-out die. And in some cases, you literally cannot dodge because the game just makes them move faster.
Looking at you Black Diablos...

Maybe try it on a really cheap sale. But it is only 15-25% complete, and most of you deaths will come from situations where there was no amount of skill that could have saved you.

EDIT: I've gone back a few times to try and find replay value, and instead found another problem. Barring the fact that they aren't really releasing anything new, the only way to advance beyond the ending or beat the highest content is with friends, or by playing 300 hours and getting ridiculously good. The resulting issue i'm facing is that the multiplayer community is TOXIC AS HELL. If there's reasonable people in this game, they don't use voicechat. if someone has their mic on, it's literally just so they can flame people. once more, two thumbs down unless you're playing with your own friends.
This game has such a small amount of content compared to other games, and now that they want 80+ dollars for the full game with Iceborne down the line, it doesn't do anything to deserve it. Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate for the Switch has over 100 monsters, constantly introducing new ones, a wealth of different play styles, and best of all, is portable. World is such an an arrogant game that doesn't even have 40 monsters, doesn't have hunter styles/arts, 5 maps, most of which are claustrophobic to no end (looking at you, Ancient Forest), and have verticality ranging all over the place to the point where I'm not sure if I'm in a forest, or in a bouncy castle with foliage. The main story is HOT GARBAGE too. MH isn't known for its story, so I'm not too mad with it being shallower than a puddle, but the gameplay you have to do to advance it is TERRIBAD. Killing monsters is usually fine in other games, but with World's trademark "These maps are more cumbersome to travel through than a peanut butter + concrete marathon" style of level design, the whole combat system suffers. And not one, not two, not three, not four, but 5 TIMES do you have to do the most arbitrary thing I've ever done in a video game. Manually track down monsters, with footprints and claw marks. I know most people got through this just fine. I am not one of those lucky individuals. The first tracking mission to find a Pink Rathian took me 10 hours. I hear some people saying already; "10 hours?!?! Wow, you suck at this game. You're worse at hunting than fucking Nemo.". And to those of you who say that, I disagree. With over a collective 1200+ hours into this series, I think I am more than capable of fighting dragons and killing monsters, and the tracking missions aren't even about hunting monsters in a game called Monster Hunter. As I said before, they're about finding tracks of a monster, and they spawn based on luck. I'm pretty sure I didn't buy "Medieval forensics simulator 2019", either. They realized later on that these missions are dreadful, and make it way easier for the later 4 times you do it. These shouldn't exist. EVER. Anyway, how's the presentation? Visually, it's stunning. The PC port is very poorly optimized for a majority of systems, so I have to put the graphics on low so that I'm not watching MS Powerpoint. Aside from some noticeable pixelation, it looks alright. I wish I could have it look better though. Other games I can easily run on Ultra High graphics, but the PC port of World leaves a lot to be desired. The music is below average. You have ambient nature for most of the game, but when it's time to throw down, you get bland and forgettable orchestra. While writing this, I'm really trying to think of any tracks aside from the first few notes on the title screen and the Astera, the main hub, but I'm struggling. Gameplay is really odd to peg, considering the fact that the level design almost always has you in a corner, and monsters stun-locking you is a very real circumstance, and sometimes you can be at full health and get combo'd, stunned, and die. I know that's sometimes the risk you take in monster hunter, but that shouldn't be an excuse. Some monsters can literally jump across an entire area, which for some, makes no goddamn sense, but either way, reasonable or not, it gets very frustrating fighting to a jumping pickle or a porcupine doing its best rabbit imitation. It needs some refining, but I can easily get that with a much more satisfyingly spent 60 dollars on the switch version, than a purchase that leaves me feeling like I could have bought something else instead and enjoyed it more. And with Iceborne announced, I now have another reason to detest Capcom. This game is not worth it.

TL;DR Main story sucks. Switch Monster Hunter has way more content. Graphics are pretty good. Music needs work. Gameplay has some glaring flaws that hamper the overall experience.

In the end, what I'm trying to say is

CELESTE GAME OF THE YEAR 2018 

SEE YA NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS
If you're willing to deal with fucking stupid hitboxes, annoying mechanics, constant stuns, and unavoidable damage until you grind 200 hours into the game to counter all of these broken mechanics, it's a...decent game. There are constant glitches and bullshit that you'll have to deal with. Imagine early game spending a solid 22 minutes hunting a rathalos only for it to get stuck into a wall, so you then spend the next 13 minutes smacking its tail through a wall as it clips through every 3 seconds. Or a monster roaring so you cup your ears, unable to do a thing, as it then bites you for half your health bar. That kind of stupid stuff :)
I understand it is looting game, but It gets very very boring, same enemy over and over and over. and lets multiply its health bar x10 and call this monster Tempered!
Pretty hefty price tag but i guess if you get it from sale then its pretty ok game . Only thing that really annoyed me was that your character doesnt speak at all.
Incorporates 3rd-party DRM: Denuvo Anti-tamper
5 different PC within a day machine activation limit

Wish I knew how bad this DRM was before purchase.
tldr: If you are looking for a soulslike game, this is not for you. Cant recommend as first game of the series.

pro: 
- pretty graphics and lush flora
- interesting monsters with distinguishable attacks
- an arsenal of weapons: 14 weapon types each with additional upgrade paths (~100 weapons, maybe?)
- every weapon type is available from the start
- satisfying combos if you can land them
- cute and very helpful kitty (it heals)

con:
- monster hunting is arduous, you will spend way more time running from A to B to C then fighting (my hardest monster was the Aranja, which i failed 10ish times; it stays in one place for about a minute, my total time for it was close to 30minutes...)
- you have nothing else to do while chasing, besides picking up some insignificant stuff (herbs etc)
- to be efficient vs a monster you need to wear the right armour as well as the right weapon; but there is no way ingame to know monster attacks and resistances BEFORE you start its mission. Tip: keep the wiki open for every hunt
Updates still come out late for PC. Game still crashes regularly. Game still disconnects from online regularly. Game still cost $60. Fix your shit Capcom
God awful. If you can get past the nightmarishly bad interface it MIGHT be a passable game. But it has the worst consolitis ever. And the level of restriction of movement is so far from actual realism - or forgiving that - actually doing what you tell it to, that the game is unplayable. 
On top of that... the lipsync for the voices is probably some of the worst I've ever seen. Seriously... how did this sell so many copies?
Honestly this game has a lot of potential. And that's why I bought it. But the game is just awful. After telling myself over and over again it would get better and forcing myself to play this game for a slow and depressing 3 days it just didnt get any better. The game mechanics just make my whole body cringe up because it feels so extremely unnatural and strange. The conversation in the game have the wrong audio, and sometimes you see the characters lips moving and you can read the subtitles but there is no relevant sound. Considering how expensive this game is, I advise you to RUUUUN! This game looks good from the outside, but once you open it up you'll quickly realize how bad it actually is. Zero out of 5 stars.
Most annoying cut-scenes all time in early game.
Boring gameplay.
Annoying characters.
Total awful character customization/ design (Even free MMO have better character development)
 

First 30min feels like a dub movie you cant get out of. Voice comming like 1 min before the game itself.
Had serveral goes trys now whit all kinds of settings and game not running fluid. Graphics are really nice but game itself just laggs. Waste of cash for a game. To bad I cant get a cash back since had to try out whit more then one settings and started the game a cuple of times and had to witness the first 30min you cant skipp whit dub
This game is a console port. If you're on Steam, you may be playing this on PC with a keyboard. If you decide to start with a ranged weapon and use a PC with a keyboard, the developers have an open hatred of you. The devs seem to have played some Card Against Humanity themed game where they went around in a circle and picked whoever suggested the keybind that made them laugh.

Once you find a usable setup, you may have bought the game for multiplayer...you don't progress in the game together. Imagine an instance in an MMO. A raid or dungeon or whatever. Typically, there's trash, and then the boss. In Monster Hunter: World, you kill the trash solo. Then you leave the instance and join a friend in their instance killing the boss. Two people who have not done any part of a quest cannot start a quest together. Because reasons.

My understanding of this game is that it's like going to Disney World, but Mickey rubs sand in your eyes when you show up at the gate and the first 50 yards into the park. There's also buckets of sand at certain rides...but each only gets used once per each of those select rides. Then, when Mickey is done rubbing sand in your eyes, the party starts.
Do you like unskippable cutscenes and no real gameplay for the first 30 min? I sure don't
I am normally fine with grindy games, but already lost interest at the start
Game looks nice, Solid character customisation. 
I realised that this game wasn't for me when I was hunting a Kulu-ya-ku. The beast is about 2 time bigger than your character and won't die. The katana I was wielding was so big that in my opinion it should have snapped it's neck in 1 or 2 hits. No health bar indicating how much hp your enemy has left. 

Running around the map hunting a creature that won't die wasn't for me!

Multiplayer was also a pain in the butt. Your friends can only join when you are on a hunt. can't be joined if the mission you're on has a cutscene. 4/10
The intro is way too long, takes the control away from the player and the Handler handholds you too much and is annoying.
I've played this game on a console before, why am I forced to sit through these cutscenes and tutorials again? I just want to play the game and see if my computer can handle it, so far one hour of the two hour refund time has been wasted
I don't know what I expected out of a game called "Monster Hunter"...

That's what you do, that's literally all you do. I probably got sucked into wanting to try this because it's a GotY contender, and I do like fighting monsters, but FFS, that's all you do... If I want to fight something big and scary I'll just play Dark Souls. 

The world you play in is very pretty, but it's what you do in that world that bothers me a lot every time I try this game. 

Simply put, the game robbed itself from everything that makes it a game in favour of pure mechanics. The mechanics is the only thing I feel this game boasts. But there's nothing here to capture you and keep you in, I feel pulled away every time I try to attempt to like this game. 

It's a shame really. This is one of those games I might change my mind about in the future, but for now I'm just done with this title.
Controls are super clunky and unfriendly even with a controller.

Monsters keeps running away like pussies. Basically, most of the fights is running after them, not even fighting them. So uninteresting! :/
Shit controls 
I had a katana. Whatever I wanted to do, it would only stab forward. As a player who chambers attacks in warband, the long sword attacks sucked balls in monster hunter. 




Boring combat, pretty difficult if you're alone. The combat consists of you doing the same combo over and over on these tanky monsters until they die or you die. Save your money and find a better game.
There is literally a cut scene for EVERYTHING! Trying to do the simplest tasks are like using your debit/credit card at the grocery store in the self checkout, it asks you a fuckload of questions to progress and makes even joining friends difficult. The mechanics are trash as well. You cant jump, once you start an attack you cant stop it nor can you change angle to aim it, the targeting system changes targets on everything and you barely use your keyboard to do anything its all click based. It lags when people join your game and sometimes crashes. Its more frustrating then fun. Fuck this game.
Eh, I bought it...if youre a fan of cinematics and constant cut scenes..this is your game. I played it just long enough to get a refund. 

If you like it then gg, I was not a fan.
