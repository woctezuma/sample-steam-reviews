Portal was my first ever Valve game, and it holds the test of time very well. The puzzles still make me think even after numerous playthroughs, and if you have yet to play it, I definitely suggest you do.
This is one of the best games on Steam without a doubt. The plot is original and the gameplay is amazing. The only downside is that it is kind of short. I would have enjoyed it being longer like Portal 2. I have 27 hours, with that much time you could have finished the game 4-5 times, but most of the time I have was spent towards achievement hunting. Great game 15/10
I will be brief: I downloaded the demo and played it for 5 minutes. Then I uninstalled it, went to the store, and bought [i] Portal 1-2 [/i] bundle that same day. The result: 50+ hours of one of the best videogame experiences in my life.
If you look past all of the stale "The Cake Is A Lie" memes, you have your self a pretty clean cut, innovative experience. Portal may only last a few short hours, but it provides friendships (with your Companion Cube) and a bitter thirst for revenge against a mysterious voice within an equally mysterious facility. If you have not picked it up already, I would suggest this gem as the next part of your Steam library.

[h1]REVIEW[/h1]
[b]Portal[/b] is an amazing experience. In terms of video games: it is the very definition of short & sweet. There are many people out there overly concerned with the length of games, and I believe [b]Portal[/b] is an excellent example of why one shouldn’t immediately scoff at a short game due to prejudices. Sometimes 3 hours of perfection is better than 20 hours of mediocrity. Sit down, immerse yourself, and just play through the game in one sitting as you would if watching a movie. It is worth it.

I say this because I believe this is a game best enjoyed in one sitting. There are no lulls or down points, and every second of the game is riveting and purposeful. The whole experience is so genuinely entertaining and the pacing is so perfectly on point that I think it is designed to be played like this. In this way, I see the length of the game as a strength and not a weakness… but maybe I’m just crazy.

But what is it that makes the game so genuinely entertaining in the first place? Everything… and then some. The concept is innovative, the puzzles are intuitive and interesting, the atmosphere is captivating, and the dialogue is hilarious and flawless. And when all of these facets come together in the finished product, the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts. And a game is created that transcends opinions: it is undeniably great.

Honestly, I respect everyone’s right to their own taste in video games; but if you don’t enjoy [b]Portal[/b], I would dutifully suggest you consider finding a new hobby. I would find it very hard to understand how anyone could possibly not enjoy this game if they consider themselves a “gamer.”

If you haven’t yet had the luxury of experiencing [b]Portal[/b], then I envy you. Stop thinking about it and just go for it.

[h1]Summary (TL;DR)[/h1]

Portal is among one of the best games in my library, I am honestly suprised I didn't play this game sooner given how much I've heard about this game before. The storyline was very enjoyable, the graphics are great (even compared to the graphics for games in 2015) and the mechanics were probably the most fun to play around with.

This game is well priced, and there's a ton of mods to enhance your game experience even further!

[b]Portal[/b] (Puzzle-platformer)

This is a title that most gamers have played, and if not played, have at least heard of.  If -- like me -- you are late to the party and have yet to play the game, this review is for you... and hey, there's CAKE!

There are tabs for the various options:

- Keyboard, where you can re-map keys
- Mouse, where you can enable the controller
- Audio, with separate sliders for Game & Music. [b] Subtitles are NOT the default[/b]. I highly suggest turning them on, as the mechanical voice is hard to understand.
- Video, where you can choose Full Screen vs. Windowed, Aspect Ratio, Brightness, Advanced, and Resolution (up to 1920x1080)

I was happy to find that the game is [i]mostly[/i] controller-compatible... The crouch function doesn't seem to be mapped, so if you're going to use a gamepad, use the Ctrl button on your keyboard to crouch ;)

The concept is simple enough.  You (will) have two guns, one that produces a blue portal, and one that gives you an orange portal.  In one, out the other.  Solve puzzles and move on to the next area.  Easy right?

Well... Yes and no.  The portals themselves aren't difficult to figure out, but you have to master the physics involved to truly progress in the game.  I had a hell of a time grasping the this point because I was so disoriented when I was falling.  Here's a hint: You need to gain some momentum if you want to make some distance when you exit the second portal, and oft times that means falling -- not just jumping -- through a portal. 

There is some platforming involved, and a variety of obstacles (of course, what kind of game would this be if there weren't obstacles?) in your way, both benign and deadly, and through it all is your ever-present narrator-guide.  I don't recommend muting her, as you'll miss out on both the ambience and a huge part of the story if you do (subtitles alone just aren't the same~).

But.. what story?  O_o The game is tagged story-rich, so I was surprised to find that there wasn't much of a story at all!  Sure it was interesting, but story-rich?  But then... finally... It all changed.  Sure it was something I was expecting, but things didn't pan out exactly how I had anticipated, either.

You will have to get through 11 chapters before approaching the end of the game, and as you complete each chapter, the Developer Commentary becomes available (accessible via the main menu.)  Whilst you're in commentary mode, you can't be damaged, but you also won't gain achievements.

Speaking of achievements, there are 15 to be had, and only 1/3 of them can be gained by playing through the game.  There are Advanced Chambers and Challenges available via the Bonus Maps section which is where you'll earn the bulk of your achievements.

It's easy to see the influences that this game has had on modern gaming, especially games like [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/]The Talos Principle[/url][/i].  [i]Portal[/i] is on the short side, but well worth playing if you enjoy puzzle-adventures, especially if you plan on playing Portal 2.
Portal is definitely a one-of-a-kind type of game. It's quirky at best, but it also remains clever, resolute and perfectly presented to those with likings for a quick-wit and a scientific explanation for including physics in a well-thought out and intelligent game, all with a touch of dark humour. It's quite rare to see a Steam user with a huge game library that doesn't include Portal nowadays. Heck, this game was my very first purchase.

You awaken in the deserted Enrichment Center of Aperture Laboratories; a fictional science research corporation, located in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Known for the creation of the handheld portal gun, as well as the heavy rivalry the complex has between the Black Mesa Research Facility. (The scientific complex focused in Half-Life. Half-Life and Portal both share the same universe.) in Portal, you play as the silent protagonist, Chell, from a first-person perspective as you are challenged to navigate through a series of cryptic chambers, all the while being accompanied by the voice of the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GlaDOS for short.) which the sociopathic robot subsequently reveals the rest of the plot to the player, through various and long-winded narration throughout the game. And what is this reward you get for all this mind-wrecking work? Why it's none other than cake! 

While on the subject of sweet chocolate butter-milk frosting, assembled with maraschino cherries on top, this all turns out to be a crude lie, and you're sent to be burnt to a crisp by GlaDOS. As you narrowly escape death, you navigate through the many things that Aperture Laboratories would have wanted to keep as a secret to the rest of the world. You soon (or later, as this game has a way of messing with your head.) find yourself exploring the air vents, empty corners with obscure writings on the wall, the sewers of the facility, as well as the abandoned, deserted offices of those who mysteriously left the complex, along with empty food supplies and crude drawings that uncovers a much darker history of the laboratories.

What strikes me most surprised is this game's ingenius concept and profound knowledge of linear momentum and physics. Your only weapon in the game, if you can call it a weapon, is the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. It's main and only ability is to create two distinct portals, an orange and blue portal, which both create a visual and physical connection between two different locations in three-dimensional space. Keep in mind that neither portal are both an entrance or an exit; all objects that travel through one portal will exit through the other. This unique concept will soon be taken to the test, as you explore, solve and escape through 19 mind-wrecking chambers all the while keeping your distance both far and dangerously close to heavily armed turret bots.

But, you're not alone in this deranged prison of a laboratory, your square-buddy (and probably only buddy.) known as the Companion Cube, will accompany you throughout a few of these chambers, as it has a handful of most needed traits; involving you using it as an extra step for those hard-to-reach places, using it as a shield against deadly laser spheres and deflecting them into switch mechanisms, and even going as so far to hold out weight-activated button switches. Sadly, with every chamber completed thanks to your Companion Cube, you will have to eventually abandon it and leave it for trash, in the Emergency Intelligence Incinerator. What a true friend to the end!

When cracking down to the lifespan of this game's story, it's actually pretty short. But, with each new chamber you progress through as well as the difficulty beginning to rise at a much faster pace, the longer the chambers will begin to mess with your head and could leave you stuck for a good couple of hours, completely stumped. I'm guilty to say that I even needed a guide to deal with a couple of these cryptic and twisted chambers. But then again, that really ruined the experience for me a little, considering I like to figure things out much more independently. So, if you can unwrap things around your mind quick and efficiently, you may experience the amazement and creativity for yourself. I'm pretty jealous in fact.

This game is a big recommendation for me. The scientific aspect of portal and three-dimensional space used in this game is best described as baffling. Valve must have been truly blessed to ever release this game, as it touched the hearts of kids, adults and professional scientists alike.
Portal, rather than a game, can be considered a metaphor of life. We wake up every morning with a commanding voice that, like it or not, pushes us to face trials increasingly difficult to get a prize. A voice that we find strange and that we don't know if we could trust. A voice that can come from the outside but also from our own unconscious. We never know if the final prize is real but we are armed of portals. But what are the portals if not the ability to be able to see the world from different perspectives? The portal is the human ability to abstract being able to immerse himself in aspects of the world that had been hidden by the limitations of the senses.
 
Ok, if you're already confused, I understand. 

Just buy the damn game.
No one probably going to see this review but because of the many positive reviews out there but I'll still give it a shot. Portal  is one of the best games I have played period. The puzzles, the story, and the humer. What I most enjoyed about this game was the suspense that they accumulated till the very end. If you have never played this before, I don't know what you have been doing with your life.
"The cake is a lie!"

It is, but Portal does not lie as it truly is a good game! While short, its puzzles make it an interesting game so much so that you'd immediately want to do a 2nd walkthrough. Also, there is a way to replay several of the so-called "chambers" but in a more difficult version.

I'm not sure if this has mods like its sequel - nevertheless, it's worth completing this one before moving on to the next as the puzzles are even more difficult and diverse in Portal 2.

I like how the game has a background story while it would not be necessary, at all. It has an excellent antagonist in the form of an A.I. called GLaDOS.

Portal is a memorable experience and if you liked Half-Life you should pick up this Valve product, as well.

Oh, you didn't like Half-Life? Then, please go and have a cake. :)

PS: I'm not sure why I have zero hours logged for this game. Probably because the logging system was introduced after I completed Portal. In any case, my review is based on a gameplay time of roughly 15-20 hours.
An absolutely essential game. Quite short by today's standards; the main campaign can be completed in around an hour once you understand the way the portals work. Like most Source games, this game hasn't really aged and because of it's unique style, it remains totally playable. If released today, it would still be incredible.
This game gives you the basic training on how to use the portal gun and to find the introduction of GLaDOS's true colours, or rather AI glitches that makes any threat to human kind. Start with this game and do buy Portal 2 when you are comfortable on how to problem solve in the test chambers.
Set in an old and abandoned Apple store from hell, Portal is the game that you think it's as easy as it sounds at first, but then realize you feel like an idiot for thinking that the levels are impossible when really you could clear them in a few minutes each. You're promised a cake from Valve's idea of if Shodan from System Shock 2 and HAL 9000 had a baby girl and almost die for it

the only con to this game is that it's too *&%^$(! short

15/10
Nice and fun tho brainstorming game. It uses physics to reach out of the levels. At the end the credits are kind of touchy and emotional. Awesome story and just enjoible game overall <3 10/10
Portal is one of the many great games made by Valve. Its a fun little puzzle game and has extra puzzles for people that like hard stuff.

Pro:
-Fun puzzles.
-Great and humorous story.
-Extra hard puzzle chambers and challenges.
-Very fun to think with portals

Cons:
-Short
-Some of the puzzle solutions are so obvious its hard to find the solution.

I recommend turning AA up to the max while playing.

I give this game a 9/10. Its one of my favorite games.
There is no other game for me personally, that I would consider perfect, other than Portal.

There is literally NOTHING flawed in the game, nothing at all I can think of.
The pacing is impeccable, with the correct timing on music and ambient playback with the story.
It covers all types of pacing with music and ambience in gameplay, from the slow and depressing downward spiral of thinking you may never escape (Self Esteem Fund from the OST), to the fast paced finale music of the game. The game made me go through so many emotions all in the expanse of my first time playing around 3 hours.

The game is UNBELIEVABLY clever, yet doesn't need to break the fourth wall to do that, which is incredibly impressive.
The game's humour is absolutely timeless, it is old as hell (9 years from this review point), and yet the jokes are still brilliant. witty, and dark. There are almost NO games that do it on the same caliber of Portal, hell, not even Portal 2 could live up to this godly creation.
The puzzles are beautifully made, completely fair (no fidgety rubbish) and once again, timeless in the sense of enjoyment. 

Visually, you might think this game is nothing to write home about, but to me, once again the game shows how age will NEVER affect this game. NEVER. simplistic visuals will always be timeless, intricate wank in videogames will ensure it stays contemporary.

I think I play through Portal 1 at least once a year. The game is short, and scales next to nothing in comparison to other games, but unlike those said games, which take hours upon hours of your life, portal will only take an hour or two. But it stays with you for life, and allows you to experience true perfection in a videogame.
I generally hate analogies for this kind of stuff, but if you can think of some other medium with a perfect technicality and timelessness to it (think of Citizen Kane or something), then Portal is that kind of game.
I think most people in the year 2016 will have played this by now, but sometimes you just gotta pour your heart out for something you cherish a bunch.

Valve may not be the greatest company, but some small dev adopted by them gave us a glimpse of perfection in a video game format. And for that, I am grateful.
Portal is a great puzzle game!

Pros:
Fun gameplay!
Nice story. (Its kinda short but still amazing!)
Clever level design.
Gets harder as you get near the end.
Portals!
Amazing graphics for its age!

Cons:
Absolutely none!

I would get this before you play Portal 2. (So the story makes sense!)
I'd say its a 10 out of 10!
There is an underlying philosophical message in the story of Portal which I don't think very many people realize: the Portal universe is a satire on Scientism. Aperture Science represents what happens when we decide to treat human beings strictly from a scientific perspective, disregarding the human perspective. Everything, from the distinctly sterline dystopian anti-human environment to the half-insane rebellion of the Ratman and especially the dark humor of Glados, reinforces this central theme of the story. Ultimately, disregarding the human perspective to only consider the scientific perspective will destroy the moral conscience of any humans who do this and lead them to force this on others as well, just as Glados forces Chell to destroy the Companion Cube. (which I think represents the consicence) Portal 2's lack of direct attention to this theme led to it feeling much less cohesive than the original.

Science is no good to us without ethics. We should always treat people as people first, not just as test subjects.

Life was meaningless.

I had no purpose other than to continue my work, the only thing I had ever known.  Work had been fun at first, and my boss had seemed nice and rather witty.  However after some time, my boss began acting strange.  It started with the lying.  Then, my boss began to intentionally make my work dangerous.  I survived, but only through quick thinking and a bit of luck.

Eventually the everyday grind of navigating my way through a neverending maze lost any appeal.  My boss promised me cake  when the job was completely done, but it wasn't worth it.  I wished for something, anything, even death, that would rid me from this meaningless existence.  I was tempted several times to walk infront of a turret or fall into the radioactive slime, but the pain these methods would bring seemed greater than the pain of a meaningless life, so I carried on.

Then one day, my boss had a surprise for me.  He had brought me a Companion to assist me in my work.  Or more specifically, an Aperature Science Weighted Companion Cube.  At first, the Companion Cube assisted me with basic tasks which I nonetheless couldn't have done without it.  We rounded a corner and came face to face with a ball of radioactive energy coming straight towards us.

I thought we were doomed, but then the Companion Cube jumped in front of me of its own accord and shielded me from certain death.  My mouth dropped, as I imagined the pain the Cube must have been experiencing.  My boss said something about "symptoms of enrichment center testing" and "perceiving inanimate objects as alive" but I paid no attention.  I knew this was love.  I knew this was real.

We continued on together for a while.  The Cube was essential in completeing the task my boss had set for me.  I tried talking to it, but I received no response.  My boss then oddly informed me that the Companion Cube would never threaten to stab me (as if it would ever)...but more importantly he informed me that my Cube was mute.  I felt a pang of sadness - not the selfish sadness one feels when they lose something, but the true sadness that is felt when empathizing with another being.

This revelation did not hamper my love for my Cube, my Companion, who had brought happiness and joy into my life, and who had selflessly endured pain to save me from death.  After opening the final door which would lead to the elevator I had grown quite familiar with, our boss seemed to congratulate us on our new found compaionship.  But then the bos said something which would change my life forever.

"However, [the Companion Cube] cannot accompany you for the rest of the test and, unfortunately, must be euthanized.  Please escort your Companion Cube to the Aperture Science Emergency Intelligence Incinerator."

I gasped in horror, looking across the room and seeing what I now realized must be the Incinerator.  I fell to my knees, tears already streaming down my cheeks.  I looked at my faithful Companion and proceeded to envelop it in my arms, determined to never let it go.

My boss continued on as if nothing was wrong.  "While it has been a faithful companion, your Companion Cube cannot accompany you through the rest of the test. If it could talk - and the Enrichment Center takes this opportunity to remind you that it cannot - it would tell you to go on without it because it would rather die in a fire than become a burden to you."

"You could never be a burden to me!" I cried, and hugged my Companion Cube to my chest.  But then I remembered.  Although my boss had lied to be at one time, boss had since promised that he could no longer lie to me.  I had to finish the testing, or else I would never get the Cake.  And if the Cube couldn't come with me...didn't want to come with me...

I hugged it one last time then picked myself up off the floor.  I walked slowly, hesitantly, toward the button that would open the incinerator.  It took more willpower than I've ever needed to press it.  Then I picked up my Companion and held it over the flames.  Tears clouded my vision and my hands began to sweat uncontrollably, and not just from the heat.  I held it there for what seemed like hours, just crying and admiring its beauty.  But then I remember the Cake.  And the Cube slipped from my hands.

"You euthanized your faithful Companion Cube more quickly than any test subject on record," said my boss.  "Congratulations."

11/10 would euthanize my Companion at the behest of my boss and all for a piece of cake again.
Different people like different games. If you like shooter but don't like RPG, it's fine, don't play RPG. If you like both, play both. But once in a while, a game comes along that is so great that EVERY SINGLE GAMER should play it, even if they don't like games of that genre. Portal is one such game. 

Portal is a first person puzzle game. It was a great game when it came out, it's a great game even now. Even if you don't play puzzle games, you should still give it a try. The puzzles aren't too difficult. The game slowly introduces new mechanic so that it's really easy to grasp. And solving the puzzles are soooooo satisfying! 

What's more? It's a puzzle game that has a great background story and although there is only one character other than the main protagonist, it's one of the best NPC in video game history. I don't think I have ever loved an NPC that tried to kill me so bad as much I love GladOS. 

Portal 1 and 2 are THE BEST puzzle games I have played in my life and are two of the best games of any genreI have played in my life.
Portal is another Grade-A game by the boys at Valve, but is it as god-like as people say.

[b]The Positives[/b]

- Very original concept.

- Totaly unique game mechanic.

- Graphics IMO hold up better than some of the other older Source games like CSS or DoD: Source. Play with HDR enabled for the full effect, the lighting is amazing.

- A very subtle story that is not told really throught the main game but more through the many secrets hiding behild the pearly white walls of Apeture Science.

- The game can get challenging, but not really in the unfair way, this game requires you to think things through and to take your time, it is a puzzle game after all.

- For the most part the game has great pacing, there are only 1 or 2 spots in the game where I feel the game slows to a crawl or feels tedious.

- The game is easy to pickup and play, and after your first or second playthrough you could easily breeze through the game like it was nothing.

[b]The Negatives[/b]

- After chamber 13, the game's difficulty spikes up unexpectingly, so for your first playthrough it can be a bit of a shock.

- The last chapter in the game is a bit too long. They buildup the confrontation of GLados alot. And in the last chapter the puzzle are not really hard or too interesting. It kinda kills the pacing for me, I would not have a problem with the game slowing down a bit at the end to build hype, but that blends into my next issue.

- The battle with Glados is not hard at all. The payoff for all the stuff you went through is lackluster. Here is how the battle goes. Hit Glados with a rocket, knock off core, grab it, put it in a cremator. Rinse and repeat 3 times and you win.  I'm not saying Glados is not an interesting villian, i'm just saying that the fight against it is kinda bad.

- The length of the game is a bit too short. 19 chambers, a chapter dedicated to escaping the test chambers, and a final fight with Glados. That is all you get for the campaign. Even for a first timer like me it will take anywhere from 3-4 hours to beat the game. There is a time attack mode, and some advanced courses, but I will be generous and say they will add another 5 hours of gameplay. You have at the most about 10-11 hours of gameplay. Pitiful for a Valve title.

- The game does not have too much replay value. I bet by your 3rd playthrough you will know each chamber like the back of your hand, and you could plow through the game.

- Screw chamber 19, that is the only unfair hard part of the game for me.

- Ganeraly I think the game is kinda bare bones once you look past the portal mechanics and the pretty aesthetic.

[b]Summary[/b]

Overall, I think I can look past some of the glaring flaws, because beyond the few blemishes the game is excellent. It is just a game I would not see myself playing again and again.

I give Portal a very solid 8/10.
GET THIS GAME NOW, I DEMAND YOU!! Oh, and be sure to play this game BEFORE you play Portal 2, although you CAN play Portal 2 without playing Portal and still understand the storyline, but the storyline is more understandable when you play Portal BEFORE playing Portal 2. If you understood that...

1 word: awesome
Portal is one of the most fun experiences I've had in gaming. The plot is simple; Your name is Chell, you're being tested in a research zone named Aperture Laboratories. You're only contact is an Ai named GLaDOS. She gives you various hints on how to pass the chambers and provides a bit of backstory to the events that happened prior to the game. You get a portal gun early on in the game which will allow you to create easy ways to travel from one part of the room to the other. But they can only generate portals on solid concrete.
The chambers get progressively harder and all the while GLaDOS becomes more malicious in her comments. For completing all the trials your character is promised cake and grief counseling in the end. 
Portal is a great puzzle game. The gameplay is really fun and GLaDOS has some of the funniest and creepiest lines of any video game character. Some of the chambers can be pretty frustrating but once you figure out what to do, you'll have a lot of fun. This game challenges the mind and gives you a great sense of satisfaction when you've beaten the game. It's an all around great experience.
Anyone else agrees that valve make really depressing games? The source engine has great physics but always looked strangley dull to me. Anyone else realise no matter what game you play, there is always some sort of nature involved. In 99% of games you will at least see grass, trees, plants, the sky, the sun or at least other characters. But not this game. Portal has no life in it at all, and no one else in the game at all (the only enemies you will see are the turrets which are only in very few segments). You can't even see the sky, you are completely trapped and deprived  in a colourless building which is why the companion cube, turrets and glados are so memorable because they are the only things you are exposed to in the entire game. Now if this was not done the right way, Portal could have been a very boring game, but since the innovation of the portals and glados and all the other highlights are added in, those things are going to get full attention from the player since nothing else is in focus since everything else is so bleak, which also why the escape sequence is so much fun, because you want to get out of this place and back outside That is fucking genius!!! Analysis OVER!
10/10
*something something tired cake meme*

Seriously this game is a classic. Funny, challenging and unique gameplay combined with a sarcastic AI judging your every action. Not much else can be said about this game that hasn't been said already. If you haven't bought this game yet, [i]do it.[/i] It is worth every cent, I promise you.
Wow. Honestly, I knew how much praise the portal games recieved, but seriously, this game is amazing. It is short (I beat it in a few hours, like 3-4), but the experience during that time is a solid A. There were a few times when I didn't know what I was supposed to do, but most of the levels were easier to follow, and required some thought, but not too much.

Pros:
I bought it on sale bundled with portal 2 for $3. If you get those prices, just buy the games. You won't regret it.
Interesting concept with a story that becomes more clear as you discover more secret areas as the game goes on.
Easy to follow, great contols.
Amazingly, the graphics hold up. Yeah, the game doesn't look like a triple A game from this year, but it looks much better than other games I've played during its time of release.
The boss fight is like nothing I've ever seen/played before.

Cons:
Sometimes the puzzles are not easily solvable. (It's rare, but it still happens)
The game is very short in comparison to most other single-player games.

Conclusion: This game is worth the full price of $10, but if you can get it for $3, you've practically stolen the game. Go ahead and buy it. You will not regret it.
Portal is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in October 2007. You play as Chell, a female protagonist that completes testings for Aperture Science Laboratories. The game features a nineteen level campaign that allows you to solve puzzles. Solving each puzzle progresses you further into the story. This review will discuss the campaign, the levels, and gameplay.

Portal features a solid campaign that provides a good introduction to the world of the Laboratories. The game begins with an in-game tutorial introducing you to the portal gun, the tests and Glados, the antagonist AI computer. Portal excels at storytelling through the slow burn approach to the story. Certain sequences in the story subtly reveal major plot points such as what is Glados planning to do to Chell once she has completed her tests. These subtle hints provide excitement for those who have noticed them as it foreshadows the final scenes in the game. Portal 1 is less about story and more about introducing you to the environment. I get the vibe that this game is more like a prologue to Portal 2 because comparing Portal 1 to Portal 2, P2 expands on the gameplay and environment and emphasises the story whereas P1 introduces you to the setting, the characters, the type of gameplay, and the story. In saying that, I do really like the introduction to the characters as Glados is a refreshing computer personality in which gives the impression that robots control humans, or Glados controls Chell.

The campaign as mentioned includes nineteen levels and these levels are basic. It promotes creativity as the levels progressively become more difficult. However, I feel the majority of the levels are simple and relatively easy compared to the final five levels. The final five levels are challenging and they require more thinking, meaning they encourage more exploration on how to complete it. The levels are of good length. About 10 out of the 19 levels took some time to complete and it lengthened the game and made it more enjoyable because the overall campaign was short at under three hours. Portal features an 'advanced levels' mode which takes the final six levels of the campaign, reworks them and makes them much more difficult to complete. I did not play this mode because I prefer not to replay the same levels with no end goal. Generally though, it does add some variety and lasting appeal to the game for players.

Portal incorporates some vibrant and detailed gameplay, particularly in the portal gun. The portal gun allows you to create two portals that transport you from A to B. Comparatively, Portal 1 delivers on the shooting aspect of the portal gun because when shooting the portal gun there is a visible bullet that travels and it creates a graphics effect when it hits the target. This exceeds the portal gun shooting animations in Portal 2 which once you shoot the gun it automatically hits the target. Furthermore, the portal gun has fitting sound that complements it. I only encountered one issue in the entire game, which is relatively minor, and that is the somewhat less-responsive nature of the controls. For instance, picking up objects would regularly require two clicks on a regular basis and when some levels have timed sections it can become slightly annoying.

Portal has very optimised performance. I played on max settings at something like 200FPS after turning off V-Sync. With V Sync enabled, I managed 50FPS and minimal stuttering.

[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]
Portal is a very solid game. It introduces you to the robot-run world and the world of testing. The story is fun in that it introduces you to the setting and characters through a slow burn story approach. The game has nineteen levels which I completed in under three hours. There is an advanced levels mode featuring the six final levels in the campaign that are more challenging. I get the notion that Portal is a prologue to Portal 2 as it is establishes all the aspects in the game, which is vastly expanded on in the sequel. In saying that, I enjoyed this first instalment into the Portal series. At USD$9.99 as a standalone product, I recommend it. However, I highly recommend the Portal bundle at USD$22.49 which includes Portal 1 and 2.

[h1] [b] Rating [/b] [/h1]
Overall: 7/10

[h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1]
- The slow-burn approach to the story.

[h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1]
- Length of campaign.

[h1] One of the most amazing original and unique games I have ever played [/h1]

Holy crap, I've never been so addicted to a game in my LIFE, and I've played hundreds of 'em! I literally could not leave my computer until I had beaten it and figured out all the puzzles for myself.... AMAZING gameplay, and quite humorous as well, I might add! (listen to "Still Alive" during the credits....lol!).

An amazing game that requires you to think in a new and unique way. Add in the ability to replay the maps with even harder difficulty and challenges adds to the replayablilty. Looking forward to the maps the online community is bound to make!

[h1] I guess I dont made a single puzzle as it should be done. My Friend who watched the whole 3 hours while playing always said: "Are you kidding me? No way, that worked man!!!" xD [/h1]
[h1] Portal [/h1]

[b] Please note: Cake and grief counselling will be available at the conclusion of this review. [/b]

Released in 2007, Portal was an FPS puzzle game developed by Valve. It quickly received critical acclaim for its unique, pioneering gameplay and darkly humoured tone. Set in the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment centre, the player assumes the role of Chell, a test subject confined within the facility by the rogue AI, GLaDOS. 

The game is separated into sequential test chambers which contain various puzzles and hazardous environments which you must navigate through using your hand held portal device. The device allows the player to create inter-spatial portals on level planes, creating visual and physical links between them. Two distinct portals (blue and orange) can be created at any one time in order to fashion an entrance and an exit through which the player and other environmental objects can travel through.

Another significant game mechanic is the concept of momentum being conserved through portals. Players and objects will exit portals with the same speed (and orientation) with which they entered them, allowing players to launch themselves great distances both vertically and horizontally.

The test chambers become increasingly more advanced and hazardous as the game progresses. Light combat elements are present, but you have no direct means of defending yourself. Instead, emphasis is placed on using portals in an evasive manner or as a way to deactivate enemies using environmental props.

Valve developed Portal alongside their Half-Life 2 series using the Source engine. The stark and often Spartan appearance of the test chambers were a conscious design choice to help players focus on the puzzles without distraction, but it also perfectly reflects the concept of a clinical laboratory setting. Despite this minimalist look, the game still looks graphically decent even by today’s standards.

Portal is very light on any form of plot and the story elements are very subtle, coming only from your interactions with GLaDOS and some hidden information caches. However, GLaDOS herself quickly becomes one of the most memorable aspects of Portal. Her script is full of sarcasm and a blatant disregard for your safety, which creates some genuinely humorous dialogue. GLaDOS’ speeches almost become a reward in themselves for completing the puzzles you encounter.

One of the few criticisms that can be levelled at Portal is its length, as it can be comfortably completed in just a few hours. However, it is worth noting that you can unlock several advanced test chambers and additional challenge modes to boost gameplay time. These extra levels really display how Portal is a game which is relatively easy to learn but difficult to master. There is also a developer commentary mode which includes some tracks from Ellen McLain (voice of GLaDOS) if you are at all interested in the development process.

Overall, Portal manages to seamlessly combine unique gameplay mechanics with an intuitive level design. It has a highly polished presentation which still looks good today. It is a genuinely innovative gameplay experience, which deserves every accolade it has collected.
This classic never gets old. It was a big surprise at the time, and even today it sets itself apart from every puzzle game. It's a good lesson in game progression and implicit tutorials, with a very insightful developer commentary mode on top of that. The only real "issue" with that game is that it has a much better sequel that makes it a bit bland in comparison, but it's still an important piece of video games history that is fun to revisit.
Portal is a unique puzzle game that will bend your mind in ways you never thought were possible. Although it is a short game, Portal will have you at the edge of your seat just waiting to see what crazy experiment GLaDOS has in store for you. Don't let the 3 hour main quest deprive you from buying this game. Portal is a enjoyable experience that I will come back to. 

And yes you will be baked and then there will be cake.
You wake up inside a small, glass cubicle.

In one corner of the cubicle is a small white coffee table. On the table there is a clipboard, an empty mug and a radio which repeats the same upbeat, voiceless tune over and over. Attached to the clipboard is an information sheet with square, yellow symbols which appear to depict a person being subjected to a variety of weird hazards. The last symbol is of a slice of cake.

In the second corner of the room there is a toilet.

The final object in the room is the most siginificant: it's the stasis pod from which you just woke up. It's glass dome lid has slid back into place.

Having taken in the cubicle and all it's contents, you realise there is no way out.

Beyond the glass of the cubicle there is a corridor which surrounds it. Through the glass you can see a timer attached to the wall, counting down from one minute. Below the timer are two vertical, parallel neon blue lines which seem to have been embossed into the wall. On the other side of the cubicle, through the glass and just above you there is a window of frosted glass. Through the diffusion you can make out a door, monitors, desks... it looks like an observation room, but it has no observers. To the left of this observation window is what looks like a security camera with a small dot of red light in the centre of the lens.

Suddenly you hear an electronic blip and then a voice speaks, "Hello and again welcome to the Apeture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center." The voice is robotic, artificial but unmistakeably female.

"We hope your brief detention in the relaxation vault has been a pleasant one. Your specimen has been processed and we are now ready to begin the test proper. Before we start, however, keep in mind that although fun and learning are the primary goals of the enrichment center activities, serious injuries may occur. For your own safety, and the safety of others, please refrain from..." there is a static noise and then the voice suddenly speeds up and becomes so fast it's unintelligible. This only lasts for a few seconds.

"......dfdoprjdrgaback. The portal will open in three... two... one..."

**************************

There you have it, the opening scene of Portal. I wanted to write that because of how significant it is that this game doesn't give you any background information or introductory cutscene. Instead it's just like, "Start New Game. Wake up. Play." This is not the first time Valve Software has pulled this trick (see Half-Life: "You're Gordon Freeman. You're on a tram. Play."), but it's as effective as ever because the onus is on you, the player, to discover what the hell is going on!

Now if you've never played Portal, I'm not going to divulge any further details. As stated above, filling in the blanks is exactly what the creators of the game intented you to do. That's YOU, not me, or any other reviewer or player or magazine or YouTuber. Just you. If you're intrigued, buy this game right now if you can and you'll never regret it.

If you have played Portal, I'm still not saying anything for two reasons: one, the person reading this who hasn't played is probably still reading (why are you still reading? Go play this game right now!) Two: there are plenty of reviews and retrospectives on this game already out there which I cannot improve upon or contribute to. Suffice to say, while I don't feel the game is beyond critisism it is still a must-play game simply because it creates one of the greatest gameplay mechanics of all time and runs with it. It's unique, addictive, mysterious, engaging and there's nothing else like it.
You've probably played Portal and Portal 2 already, but for those who haven't, oh boy, are you in for a treat. They are both examples of what I'd consider, perfect video games. Not just an original idea, not just solid mechanics, not just great story and music and characters, but all of it in one package. Yep, they're gonna get a glowing recommendation from me. In my opinion, everyone should play these games, with the notable exception of people who hate puzzles. Even then, these could be the games that change your mind. 

But lets say you know nothing about video games and haven't heard of Portal. Well, it's a puzzle game set as a first person shooter. That is, you see through the character's eyes. The unique idea behind this game is that you have a portal gun. You fire the gun at one wall and then another, and then a portal will form, connecting the two points, which you can then walk through. Using this simple but ingenious mechanic, the game has designed dozens of clever puzzles for you to solve.

The story behind the game is that you are a test subject in some bizarre maze-like facility run by a homicidal AI named GLaDOS. Now, despite the cool setting and great gameplay, what really elevates this game is the characters. There's only two, GLaDOS and, in the sequel, Wheatley. But despite the fact that the communication you have with these AI is completely one-sided, they absolutely make the game unforgettable. Their dialogue is movie quality, and funny as hell. In fact, GLaDOS has been voted one of the best video game villains of all time.

I can't think of much else to say, other than buy these games, you won't regret it. 5/5 stars.
Everyone knows what Portal is. It's not as good as Portal 2, but still totally worth a play. It also makes the story of portal 2 make a lot more sense. If you haven't played this for some reason, pick it up now. It's one of the few must-play classics.
The original game that spun off the Portal Series... It wasn't all that big, just a few levels, to think of what would eventually become the framework behind Portal 2 though, and the legacy behind this game... I'd definitely recommend it if you've never tried the franchise.
Yikes!  I owned this game for years and years and never played it.  What a dummy!  This is one of the most brilliant and funny games I have ever played, from start to finish.  It's amazing and amusing right through the very end of the end credits.  Looks like I finished in just under 5 hours, but what a ride!  I think I'll probably purchase Portal 2.  Even if it's only half as good as this game, it's twice as expensive so.....I'll probably wait a bit to to see if it goes on sale.  

TIP: Don't disable any turrets till you have a chance to listen to all of their dialogues.  And don't move onto the next level too soon or you'll interrupt and miss the main computer's amusing lines.  Excellent writing!

P.S.  Just after posting this review, I accidentally discovered a free mod on Steam for Portal owners that adds 19 additional puzzles!  It's called Rexaura.  I almost missed out!  Why didn't they make a bigger deal out of this?
[h1]Not playing Portal is a big mistake[/h1]
No seriously. What are you doing with your life? How could you ignore this masterpiece for so long? You probably think your efforts will be rewarded with cake. [spoiler]It won't.[/spoiler] The reward is the game itself.

[h1]Positive:[/h1]
- One of the most memorable gaming experiences of my life.
- Hilarious, incredible, and amazing script and voice acting. Shout-outs to GLaDOS. It still amazes me that the one and only voiced character will entertain, anger, surprise and sadden you throughout the game. 
- Companion cube loves you <3.
- Puzzles are well throughout out and designed.
- Very friendly learning-curve. 
- This game is perfect for both gaming beginners and veterans. Beginners are taught how to handle gradually-tougher puzzles, making Portal very non-frustrating. Veterans on the other hand will encounter challenging puzzles along the way. 
- Replay value to the max.
- Great ending-credits song.
- Graphically the game still holds up.

Portal is a true classic! A game every gamer should play at least once in their lifetime, The game is quite short though, so if you like this one you should try out portal 2 for more fun! Anyway, I highly recommend this game!
Oh how I wish Valve would make more single player games they're really good at it.

Don't get me wrong, Valve's multiplayer games are just as good BUT VALVE REALLY IS AMAZING at making single player games, but sadly there will be no more games from valve single player or multiplayer.
But portal is an amazing game. 

9.9/10 
Why 9.9 you might ask, because I really wanted that cake.


Oh and I became gay for a cube.
Portal is one of the most fun games I have played in a long time. It is a combination of first person camera view with an almost pure puzzle solving game style which is an awesome combination in my opinion. 
The events of Portal take place within the Half Life universe. During the game, you take control of Chell, who wakes up inside the Aperture Science Enrichment Center. You are informed by GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) that you will be participating in the testing of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. As you progress through the testing chamber, it becomes more readily apparent that all is not as it originally seemed.
The portal gun adds a whole new dimension to puzzle solving. All throughout the game, you are presented with situations that will seem near impossible to overcome. After some thought, it becomes clear how you can use the portal gun to solve the puzzle. As the game progresses,  the complexity of the puzzles increases and you often have to think two or three moves ahead in order to progress further.
After you complete the game, two new modes, Challenge and Advanced, are unlocked. The Challenge mode forces players to solve the same puzzles again, but this time, with time or movement limits restricting them. Advanced mode simply ups the difficulty of puzzles by adding new obstacles and hazards.
Portal is extremely short. It will take only a few hours to complete the whole game but the minimal time you will spend with the game, is well-worth the money.

Sounds 9/10
Graphics 9/10
Gameplay 9/10
Atmosphere 9/10

There are a few games that I can recommend to everyone and will continue to recommend to everyone until the end of time. Portal is just one of these games-- where a gamer can fall in love and someone new to video games can find a challenging and engaging experience that tests your mind. Each level is designed to build up the gamer to feel confident that the challenges aren't impossible and by the end of the game you feel as though you're the only one that could have possibly thought of that particular answer... of course there are only a single answer for each level but Portal is built for you to enjoy every moment of the game. 10/10 great game
What else is there to say about Portal that hasn't already been said? It's fantastic and set a new precedent in gaming for this generation, showing that truly original concepts and fascinating story can trump good graphics and developer ownership.

Portal is astounding, and if you haven't played it, you really ought to. Though, make sure you have enough money spare for Portal 2; I guarantee you'll want to buy it as soona s you're done with Portal!

[b] Review [/b]
I was always hesitant to buy Portal for I am not a fan of puzzle games, but it was on sale and everyone told me it was great so I got it and I was happy with what I bought. Portal 1 and 2 are the only puzzle games that I have played and enjoyed. That is high praise for I played many puzzle games and the Portal series are the only ones I liked. You play as a human test subject and try to complete puzzles with a portal gun. If you like puzzle games with a nice little story this is the game for you. There is a reason this game has overwhelmingly positive reviews. I suggest buying this on sale.

Beautiful game, beautiful soundtrack, superb gameplay, amazing puzzles. Short game though. I played this game back in 2007 when Orange Box was just released, beaten it 3 times by now actually. I really strongly recommend you to play this masterpiece and the sequel if you still somehow haven't! This was back when Valve was making games!

Definitely 10/10!
I enjoy puzzle games, so I bought Portal expecting some puzzles, and that's exactly what i got. It really makes you think, and challenges your brain to solve complicated problems. There's 19 main levels, [spoiler]a long escape level[/spoiler], and an [spoiler]ending boss fight.[/spoiler] It only takes a few hours to complete, but it's worth your money. The game isn't just a puzzle game, though. It has an interesting storyline, too. [spoiler]The ending of the game makes you wonder, "Well, what happens next?"[/spoiler] I bought both Portal and Portal 2 in a bundle, expecting that I would want to play the second game too, and I was right! Lots of people play only Portal 2 and not Portal, but I would highly reccomend playing Portal before even opening Portal 2. Fantastic game!
First of all this game needs to be listed among "all fine-timers"
It gives you a good brain run of problem solving,unimaginable funny dialogs, and lots of fun!
But it has is own cons and pros.
Positive side:
-Effective problem solving
-Captions
-Fast gameplay
-Epic puzzles
-Grapchics is just simply amazing!

Negative:
-Shortness


Portal is a fascinating puzzle game that was first introduced in the Orange Box, a bundle of random Valve games like Half Life and Team Fortress 2. The story is that you play the role of a test subject, Chell, trapped in an abandoned building known as Apature Science. A mysterious voice instructs you to go through several test chambers with the use of a portal gun, a device that can shoot portals in order to teleport one place to another. So it all relies on your skill and brain power in order to escape Apature alive, while enjoying some cake for your victory... maybe. As the name states, the game is all about portals. Wether it be using portals to get to a higher area, or to get a weighted cube to hold down a switch, it's always fun to just mess around with the portal gun. There are 19 Levels and most of the puzzles are pretty easy, so it's a short game. There are also advanced maps and time trials that'll keep ya busy if you think the game is too easy. While it's sequel is much more popular, it's predecessor is still fun to play.
Absolute steal for $1 during the 2017 summer sale. This is a must-play at this price point.

+Engaging puzzle-based gameplay
+Amazing story and ending
+Really funny
+Graphics hold up pretty well
+Great job of teaching game mechanics then ramping up difficulty at the end
Portal is a [u]classic[/u] and always will be. Shorter and easier than Portal 2, but definitely more charming. 

This is a game every gamer should at least play once. The story is very intriguing and you can't help but wonder, [i]"what, why and how?"[/i]

I only have two complaints really, the stupid elevators and the floating balls of death that always seem to catch me when I’m stuck trying to figure out how to put it where. But the overall experiance is [b]fantastic[/b].

[i]I fully recommend this game[/i], and for the price it's worth that and more. You really have no reason to not at least try this game. 

[b]<3[/b]

The main game is great, but be warned that is extemely short. I beat the game in just over 2 hours. If you're looking for something longer, get Portal 2 instead, or just buy both games in a bundle as they're both amazing.

“Portal” is one of the few games that undoubtedly lives up to the hype surrounding it. While some of the games’ puzzles are simplistic and relatively easy, they often become increasingly challenging and require you to think creatively for a solution. This is a game that requires patience, thoughtfulness, and a sense of humor. Not only are the puzzles themselves addictive, but the excellent voice acting, commentary, and overall story are crucial components that make “Portal” the irresistible gem that it is.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

"Portal" is an incredible game; well worth buying.
Note: This game been tried out and reviewed in Steam offline mode or on Consoles.

Portal: This game is probably one of the most innovative titles of the decade. You play as the female protagonist named Chell. In the beginning of the game, Chell awakes inside of a glass room. A radio playing some upbeat music is the only noise heard until an eerie voice from the Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System (GLaDOS) fills the air. GLaDOS informs Chell about some very valuable tests that need to be performed

Portal is a pure surprise of enjoyment. you will get hooked on this game wishing for more by the end. and this game opens up the door for future implementation in valve games that should be very fun.

Portal is still revolutionary. The challenging puzzles and clever dialog are beautifully mixed together. Plus, the fact that you're able to reach each goal using different methods truly makes the game personal and memorable for each person.
Yeah, I see why this is seen to be a classic now. 

It's been sitting in my stream library for a while and only now have I decided to reduce my backlog and play it.
So yeah, pretty sure i'm the only person on the planet who hadn't played it at this point but for those who for some reason haven't done so, I reccomend playing this wholeheartedly. 

It's such a fun, lovable puzzle game, and Glados' commentary is just the icing on the cake (did I mention there's cake?)

NOW ONTO PORTAL 2 I GO.
A short but fun campaign with lots of replayability and an interesting backstory.
The level designs are great and the mechanics are easy to learn and the game introduces you to them slowly to help with it.
Fun game. Easy to pick up if you aren't an advanced gamer! Lots of strategy! I had to think hard on some levels and take a break to clear my mind. I enjoyed the humor in the game and great sound track. CAKE IS A LIE!
Easily one of the best games I've ever played. Tests aside, the atmosphere and story of this run down and half-kept science lab are captured perfectly, on par even with the sequel. Highly recommended.

Do you like box puzzles? 
Do you hate having to walk to get across a room? 
Would you enjoy listening to a passive-aggressive HAL 9000?

If none or more of these apply, Portal is the game for you! This game offers the ability to destroy Einstein's theory of relativity by allowing you to make two points in the world the same. In layman's terms, a portal.
With these portals, you can perform amazing stunts such as redirecting dark energy, moving boxes, incinerating friends, getting to the refrigerator for a soda faster and much more. 

You can get nineteen portal-based puzzles for a low low price of $9.99, but that's not all! If you order now, we'll throw in six more advanced puzzles, free of charge! What are you waiting for? Buy the nine year old FPS puzzle game that has innovated the way that science is done!
if you carry an active turret right behind the forcefield to GLADoS and let it shoot you, excess bullets hit GLADoS and she will literally drop all of her cores. just don't die
Portal was one of the games that inspired me to start pursuing a job in the games industry.  Portal is a unique blend of the puzzle, FPS, and (to some extent) first-person platformer genres.

The game, for the most part, is a tutorial made into a full game.  This is, however, not a bad thing at all.  The game does its job exceptionally well to ensure the new mechanic, and namesake of the game, Portals, are taught to the player with little room for confusion.  This is an exceptional feat when Portals force players to think differently about the spaces around them, and how to traverse them.

Besides enjoyable puzzles and interesting environments to explore, the game employs GLaDOS, effectively the narrator of the game, to serve as a means of adding dark comedy to the mix.  GLaDOS's unique sense of humor makes players want to continue through the game to discover both the secrets of the facility they wake up trapped within, and hear what witty remarks GLaDOS will say next.

To conclude, I would recommend Portal to any fans of puzzle games, as well as any fans of FPS or casual games.
Growing up in a small Wisconsin household I was always bored, I had nothing to do, but this game, half life 2, and team fortress 2 were all I had to goof around on. Half Life was Great, TF2 was amazing, but Portal stuck with me. It's a game you'll no doubt hear about from anyone who says they play video games, at least if they're an adult anyway this game is old. Even though it's 10 years young portal still is one of the only video games which has it's main theme in the name of the game, you shoot portals, woopty doo. The story is one of the main reasons people like portal, and anyone who came from portal 2 probably bought this game from the orange box, or alone just for the lore. The lore goes along as you'd expect from a valve game after half life, mute people have problems too. Chell, our favorite unfortunate test subject, must go through all the tests from the infamous Glados. As you work your way through the game you get the feeling something is off very soon, with hints left by our favorite labrat. The story was so well polished and bittersweet, it feels amazing when you transition into portal 2 after completion.

So thanks Valve, this game was my childhood, and I have you to thank for that. 

TL;DR: Portal is a great game with near-perfect level design and lots of enjoyable mechanics. The modes outside of the main mode aren't very good, but if you're looking for a solid game that will take you a few hours to beat, this is the game for you.

	Portal is a game where you try to get from point A to point B by using different mechanics such as portals and cubes. The game does an outstanding job introducing its mechanics gradually, so that way the player isn't confused nor bored. The game's story, level design, mechanics, art design, and progression are amazing, however the alternate game modes (namely being the steps and time challenges) are a bit lackluster.

[u] LEVEL DESIGN [/u]

	The levels in Portal are simply amazing with everything in each level working together to bring the player a great experience. Everywhere the player needs to go is highlighted by an object or an art asset, so the player never feels lost. Even though this may seem hand-holding or too easy, the game will still leave enough puzzles to the player to add enjoyable gameplay with a large sense of satisfaction at the end of each puzzle. Some of the levels in the game have different shortcuts that only experience players will find. These shortcuts add replayability to the later few levels of the game, as the player will most likely not find all of the shortcuts in his or her first playthrough of the game.

[u] MECHANICS [/u]

	Portal's mechanics are very consistent throughout the game, and compliment the level design. Portal does a great job of keeping the mechanics consistent so the player knows exactly what to do. For example, you cannot place portals on dark surfaces or metal throughout the entire game. All of the games mechanics interact with the level design to create a cohesive puzzle that is extremely entertaining. In the game, every time you see a large button, you know that there is a cube nearby, and the level does a nice job of explaining where the cube is. Also, in the earlier levels where momentum is needed to solve a puzzle, there is always an extended piston so the player knows where to place his or her's portal. The piston tells the player that momentum will be involved, so the level design and mechanics work well together.

[u] ART DESIGN [/u]

	The art design in Portal is very simplistic, which puts emphasis on the different aspects of each puzzle. It's very hard to get lost in Portal, because the puzzles stand out so much against their environment. In Portal, because everything is so simple, it gives the player a sense of "Everything is here for a purpose." The art style also does a great job of telling a story. In the game, certain areas opt-out of using standard lights, and instead use these small rooms hidden behind opaque windows to give the player a feeling of being watched. The art design in Portal works really well with the gameplay and the theme.

[u] ADVANCED MAPS [/u]

	The advanced maps in Portal add a little bit more to the game, but I don't think they're anything to write home about. The advanced maps in Portal add obstacles, and remove shortcuts to the already existing levels to make them harder. I didn't spend much time with the advanced levels, as they're built on the same maps from the main game, because I feel the main game's maps are a lot more open with what way you solve the puzzle. Each advanced map has only one or two ways to solve the puzzle, whereas the main game of Portal has lots of different ways to solve each puzzle. Overall, I prefer when there are lots of ways to solve a puzzle as opposed to just having one way, so I didn't enjoy the advanced maps as much.

[u] CHALLENGES [/u]

	In Portal, there is a separate mode called "Challenges." The challenge maps are the exact same maps from the main game, however you have a second goal, such as using the least number of portals, taking the least amount of steps, and completing the level as fast as possible. Completing each one of the later levels with the least amount of portals I found pretty clever and fun, but the other challenges have lots of problems. I found the least number of steps challenge to be ridiculous and unenjoyable. The mechanics needed to complete the level with a gold rating, I found to be pretty frustrating and irritating to pull off. Another issue with the steps challenge is Chamber 17. In Chamber 17, most of the level has nowhere to put a portal. Having nowhere to put a portal completely takes away from the challenge, and becomes an annoying game of timing each jump. The final challenge is the time challenge. In theory, this challenge should be pretty fun as it let's anybody try to be a speedrunner. However, for a few of the challenges, the time given to get gold is extremely low, and turns the challenge into constantly saving and reloading. This problem could easily be solved by giving the player a few more seconds to get gold. Overall, most of the challenges are not fun, but they do add lots of replay value as the player must try each challenge over and over again until he or she gets gold.

[u] DEVELOPER COMMENTARY [/u]

	The Developer Commentary in Portal is put together well, and is pretty interesting. If you're interested in the development of games, including art design, voice acting, and level design, then I recommend playing through the Developer Commentary.

Portal as a whole is an amazing game, that has incredible level design. The game does have some problems in its other game modes, but the main game is still great. If you are even remotely into first-person games or puzzle games I strongly recommend this game.
A game I just finished roughly in about 2 - 3 hours (the difference being all the "figuring out" time), Portal is a game certainly worth owning.

This is from a person who blindly bought Portal 2 without any prior knowledge of its earlier surprise success or without the imagination necessary to fathom how "portal mechanics" in of itself, without any other additive, be a good game.
Though I enjoyed the pacing, character dynamics, and indirect indie movie-like world building in Portal 2 more, going back to see how it all began will help explain particular jokes and flesh out many of GlaDOS's warped programming. If there's one complaint about Portal it's that, yes, it's a bit short even if for $10 but it's not like you aren't gettiing your entertainment/experience value and its chock full of special features for further insight if that's your sorta thing (it is to me!)

One complaint that might not bother others but sorta bothered me - again because I'm comparing it to 2 instead of vice versa - is that the game wastes no time piling complexity at you versus in #2 how it could often blend world building and exploration more frequently. It's a case of tight budgeting vs. free property reign but I feel it should be addressed.

All in all, Portal again cements Valve's rep at never offering inept neurally challenged games. Believe the hype or challenge it, either way, playing any entry from the series will add something you'll cherish in your life.
At the first sight game looks like simple, puzzled game with intresting mechanism of creating portals what makes some of quests quite challenging. Amusing monologs of not complcated plot and stylish retro-graphics of alternative future give spice to whole image. Who would ever imagine how this story might suprised you at the end? 
If you like extraordinary humor wrapped in logical riddle gameplay of weighted companion cube... this game is so for y o u!
It's the classic space-bending, mind-bending puzzle game. It has FPS mechanics, but it was enjoyable for me (someone who doesn't understand FPS's) as well. Replayability is low, but it was an amazing journey through and through.
Amazing game with an amazing story and great puzzles. You know that developers made a great job if you can love an object in a game... Could be longer, but it was just an addition to the Orange box. The puzzle potential was fully shown in the second game. Revolutionary puzzle game! 9/10
[h1]Portal ★★★☆☆ (3.0) [/h1]

Another one of Valve’s classic masterpieces, though it obviously is way worse than its sequel in basically every aspect, the story in Portal (1) is good and it’s important for the Portal/Half-Life universe. The puzzles are well designed and they’re fun to solve, the difficulty is balanced as well, but the true thing that makes this game unique are the portals and their breathtaking physics, that even today, 12 years later, are still impressive.

[b]Recommended with or without discount (or just buy the Valve Complete Pack), GOTY 2007 [/b]

Loved the game it has amazing environmental storytelling and the puzzles are mind boggling, Honestly thought the game would be harder first going into it but its easy pretty much a point and click game that anyone with a mind could beat, this does not spoil the game just a key thing for anyone going into thinking its the next dark souls, lastly if you've played half life 1 or 2 this is a must play
A brilliantly innovative game with unique mechanics and puzzles that make you feel like a genius once completed, all wrapped up with witty jokes that are sure to make you smirk at the very least!
Amazing game of physics and technological advances.
The game brings about an interesting twist to the future that we could one day have with technology. 
It can seem to be a bit short, but fun all the same,
It’s pretty fun. But I wouldn’t recommend buying it full price. The gameplay is too short. I beat it (zero guides used) in 2 hours so the 99 cent sale is the best time to get it.
A good game, I recommend this better than Portal 2 still due to the clear puzzles without having to look at guides too much. The Ratman story and achievements are a good feature to this, definitely recommended and worth the money.
That was really clever and fun, also, I love you GLaDOS, you're my soulmate. Sorry about you know, [spoiler]murdering you?[/spoiler] Please don't hate me.
Bought it for $2 on sale.  One of the better puzzle games I've ever played.  A little dated, but a true brain-teaser wrapped up in a succinct yet satisfying package.
When I first played Portal on the Xbox 360, I was amazed by it due to the simple, but enjoyable concept of the game. The story isn't too great, but I enjoy puzzle games, and this one had me hooked, Sadly it is quite short, but there are challenges and advanced (i.e. harder) versions of test chambers 13 to 18. Some might ask "well why not all of them", and I believe it is for the simple reason that test chambers 1 to 12 are introductory and so adding challenges or an advanced version would be quite boring, as there is a set path and consequently very little to change, furthermore you don't receive the dual portal device until test chamber 11, further highlighting the linearity.

Overall it is a different experience to your typical FPS game, and an enjoyable one at that.
This is a culturally important game, so I think it is good to play it yourself and form your own opinion.

However, I find the story of Portal rather annoying than fun, and its 3D nature makes it confusing to navigate. I like how it has inspired other games (especially 2D ones) to incorporate the portal mechanics, though.
