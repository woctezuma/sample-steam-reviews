Games don't scare me. Movies don't scare me. In fact, short of being dropped in the middle of the ocean or singing in public, there's not much I'm bothered by... except Amnesia. Why? Because in this game, I am powerless. I cannot fight back. Games like Doom, Resident Evil, Dead Space, etc.; They fail to send chills up my spine and make me squeal like a child because they made the mistake of giving me an arsenal of weapons and badass personality traits. Are Isaac Clarke and Claire Redfield afraid? Sure, and I don't blame them. But I'm not, because I look awesome and I can materialize various tools of immenent destruction. Those creepers waiting to pop-out from behind the corner aren't trying to scare me, they're sacrificing themselves to the God of Death! Amnesia, though... My tools are the world's worst lantern and a number of closets to hide in! I couldn't fight if my life depended on it, and it most certainly does. Well done, Amnesia; I haven't looked over my shoulder this much since I was 12.
A true classic and the benchmark by which all other horror games are judged.

Amnesia is an old school horror experience where it is what you can't quite see that terrifies you more than what you can see. It puts you on the edge of madness and terror and keeps you there without ever pushing you to the point where it because mundane.

The story is actually very engaging, with the protagonist being an Englishman suffering amnesia, stumbling around a dark castle searching for answers. But those answer are unlikely to bring you joy. However whilst the story is horrific enough, the true brilliance of this game is the way it injects you with a feeling of utter helplessness and despair. You never feel like you have any options other than to run and hide, and even those options feel temporary, simply putting off the inevitable for a little longer. And yet run and hide you do. 

And no game I have ever played has used darkness so effectively. It is both your best friend and greatest enemy at the same time. It will hide you from the terrors, but it will expose you to the insanity brewing in your own mind. So you flit from light to dark, never able to truly feel comfortable in either.

Everything about this game works well to produce a true feeling of fear. The sound and the visuals are great and the game mechanics are actually very cool. Pushing and pulling items around, moving chairs in front of doors, it all works to give that genuine horror movie experience.

If you like horror games this is a must have. And I dare you to play it at night, with the lights off and headphones one :)

I recorded my full play through and you can watch it here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQyIjLHJg70&list=PL5204B6DA22162CC3&index=1


The original indie horror game that started it all. If you are in need of a good scare with an incredibly creepy setting, and actual storyline, this is the game for you. I cannot stress enough how fantastically horrifying it is. This is mostly done through the constant needs to push forward to avoid the darkness chasing you, but the knowledge that ahead lies horrible monsters. You're sort of stuck in the middle and it leaves you with a sense of helplessness that I've never experienced before.
[b]Amnesia: still the ruling king of horror games[/b]

Horror games are a special genre. What scares one person to hell, could make somebody else just raise an eyebrow, or even come across as comical to yet another gamer. Opinions on what makes a good horror game do vary accordingly, but amidst all these discussions, there's one game that stands out: [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i]. Almost everybody who has played this game, concedes that it is exceptionally scary, and thus succeeds wonderfully as a horror game.

The first of the two [i]Amnesia[/i] games, it was released just five years ago, in september 2010. It's not the first horror game by its developer, Frictional Games, who earlier made the [i]Penumbra[/i] games, but it's certainly the title that made Frictional Games famous. With the hype around the upcoming release of [i]Soma[/i], yet another Frictional title, playing through their best known horror game yet only seemed appropriate, and long overdue.

Actually I started this game already three times earlier this year, every time not finding the courage to move on after the first hour or so, out of pure fear. I only play this kind of games when it's dark outside, using headphones, in order to let them develop their full scaring potential, but with [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i] this kind of approach just looked impossible. The past couple of weeks I finally found the courage to persevere (in complete darkness), but I was only able to play the game in small pieces, only half an hour or so on end, after which I literally had to recover.

This may seem like exaggerated, but it's not. This game is by far the scariest I've ever played. Playing as Daniel, you have to re-discover who you are and what you're doing in a medieval castle somewhere deep in the German woods. As the game progresses, the story poses more and more questions, and only at the very end did all the pieces come together for me. But it's not the story itself that's particularly scary. It's the way the game puts the player in an extremely vulnerable position, without any means of defense (no swords or guns in this one!) and only some tinderboxes and a lantern as a means to progress through the increasingly unsettling surroundings.

The game is by far the darkest I've ever played. Darkness is actually transformed into one of the game's defining elements: when standing in darkness, Daniel slowly but surely turns mad, and the only way to counter this is either to light some candles with the tinderboxes, or to light your lantern. Since lantern oil is quite scarce, I found myself constantly trying to save it as much as possible. There is a constant looming danger in the form of monsters, who are seldomly to been seen but impose terror upon the player by sound or just by thought. For when a monster finds you, it's almost surely instant death. The game manages to strike the perfect balance between slowly progressing episodes where I was fumbling around in the dark, hiding for monsters and looking for clues or letters, and some scenes where the only option was: run!

It's hard to describe in words exactly why this game got so deep under my skin, though, because it terrified me on an even deeper level that has nothing to do with graphics or game mechanics. I think the theme of man turning into a monster even worse than any monster imagineable struck a resonating chord inside me. I found myself screaming out loud at times, mostly out of utter disgust at what was happening. The game had a very unsettling effect on my, and probably that's why it took me several tries to play and finish it. It's a masterpiece in its genre, yet to be trumped.

[b]Very highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart, nor for heart patients[/b]
Similar to the Penumbra games, Amnesia: TDD is all about atmosphere and storytelling.  The biggest difference between the two series is that Amnesia does include more of the classic horror induced moments of being chased and hunted.  Not that Penumbra didn't have a bit of that, but I'd say in Amnesia, there were specific moments designed to inject some action.

Overall however, the game is paced similarly.  I could wander about, sip some coffee, read my notes and mementos and take in my surroundings.  
This may sound casual but what Amnesia succeeds in doing is creating a sense of dread.  Brennenburg Castle is a miserable place and rarely do you find yourself feeling too comfortable. When an enemy does discover you and then gives chase, it is probably one of the more scary moments I've experienced in a game.  The music, the blurriness of your view, the sound of the monster chasing you...not to mention, when you do finally get behind a closed door and find a hiding spot, you then get to watch as the door is violently brought down into pieces. All you can do is hope you're not spotted as you stare at the wall (there is a "sanity" element if you're new to these games).  IRL, I am guilty of some audible "gasping" during these moments.  During one particular chase I couldn't find an adequate path to get away from my pursuer and let out a frightened yelp that I am ashamed to even admit. Though, it is important to mention that I allowed the game to get under my skin purely because it was better that way.  I could have played it and completely steeled myself from letting it get to me (e.g. left the lights on, lowered the sound, casually approached the objectives), but what's fun about that?  For me, nothing.

As far as the story is concerned, I felt compelled to move forward to find the next clue.  I could feel a bit of excitement (or perhaps it's better described as relief) every time I saw a new note to read or completed a puzzle.  Naturally I won't reveal any spoilers just in case someone does read this review. 

I must emphasize that this is not a game full of jump scares and over the top gore.  With that being said, there are some very disturbing scenes that you come across.  I walk away from this game still thinking about some of what I experienced. Not just from the imagery but the story in general. Per the recommendation from the developers when you first start the game, play with the lights off, don't worry about saving and allow the story to drive you forward.
After spending days thinking about what to write in this review, I finally have come to the conclusion that mere words cannot summarize this gem of a game. I could write tremendously long essays describing what makes [b]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/b] an unique masterpiece, but it's to no avail. One would have to play the game in order to understand its beauty and its charm...

[i]"Wait a second, I thought this was a horror game? ..."[/i] . It is. It's a terrifying journey in its own rights, from start to the end. But I can't help it, the [b]atmosphere[/b] of Amnesia is one of the most, if not the most refined one I have ever witnessed in a video game. The Brennenburg Castle is a truly memorable place. During the first half of the game, you will be exploring the highly architectural, yet haunting chambers, familiarizing yourself with the gameplay mechanics, the story of the main character and the lore. I'm not going to go into lots of detail about the second half, but I'll just summarize this part with a quote that I think fits it best: "All good things come to an end.", as you will understand what the beautiful castle hides, buried deep within.

The story of [b]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/b] does not lack at all in quality, but nor is it the most intriguing or most interesting. However, you may have to give the game a second playthrough to fully understand the lore. You're playing as Daniel, an archaeologist. The plot spawns after Daniel retrieves a strange, mystical orb from a tomb in Algeria. From that moment on, he starts getting nightmares and the people he interacts with end up brutally killed sooner or later, by a strange force. He realizes he's being haunted by this orb and that, in the end, he will end up dead too, so he decides to follow the instructions from a strange letter he recieved, signed by Alexander, baron of Brennenburg. Most of the narrative will be brought to the player by finding notes and bits of Daniel's journal, scattered across the castle, but there are also occasional flashbacks, which will give you an insight into what happened in various places, throughout your journey. Story length's neither too small or big. Expect around 10-15 hours of playtime, if you also want to collect every journal fragment. It's worth noting, though, that this game suffers from the replay value factor. I don't see myself replaying it anytime soon as there's not any content to it besides the main story. Then, you may ask, why do so many people still play this game? The answer lies in the great implementation the devs added to the game: community made maps, aka [i]custom stories[/i]. These are (for the most part) completely new settings created by various people, with new stories and environments (they're made using Amnesia's original assets, so it goes without saying: don't expect something as fresh as a brand new game). There are hundreds upon hundreds of them, fairly easy to find on the Internet and there are also Steam Guides regarding which ones are worth your time, or even how to create your own one!

Let's move on and talk about the sound quality. This is another element where Amnesia shines brightly. Music is fitting and the sound effects are top-notch. The monster's growl will make your skin crawl and when he spots you, a ghastly music will commence. But all in all, when there is nothing dangerous nearby, you will be surrounded by a charming melody, one that immaculately fits the game's vista.

Graphics of this game are quite impressive for such a small team (at that time?). Of course, they cannot compete with big name's engines, but nonetheless Amnesia does look good and the visuals have never been an immersion-breaker. The optimization suffers in certain areas, notably places with many sources of light, where the framedrops tend to flutter. I do not have a beast of a rig, but my specs highly surpass the recommended ones on the store page. It's nothing of a big issue to me, though, and the FPS never dropped below 30.

The gameplay is interesting, to say the least. I don't see often horror titles blending puzzles in such a non-intrusive way, like Amnesia does. The puzzle element is on point here, you will run quite often into trouble, doors needing keys to be unlocked, machinery that needs more power, escaping from narrow areas etc. The monsters are here to give you a hard time and will do their best to stop you from advancing. Unfortunately, one thing I did not like is that, for the most part, the enemies will unrender after a while. Thus, you may find a good place to hide and wait for the beast to just go away... I wish they would patrol the area instead.
However, the puzzles are intelligent and non-repetitive. Sometimes, the answer is not as obvious as it seems, or it requires the player to read some notes, advance some more in the story etc.
Another unique element here is the "sanity" system. Basically, staying in the dark for too long, looking at the monster or witnessing unexpected events will drain your lucidity, giving Daniel headaches and ultimately hallucinations, collapsing on the ground, allerting the monsters, along with different screen distortions. Always conserve your lantern oil, as most of the game takes place in dark surroundings. An interesting trivia, when your sanity is dangerously low, some elements of the game will change, such as Alexander's portrait on the wall paintings or some corpses appearing in various locations.

The horror aspect is top-notch, rarely has any game made my heart beat this fast when being chased by the enemy. In Amnesia, you have no means of defending yourself. Darkness can be your foe, but also your best friend when it comes to hiding. The monsters are much faster than you, they can break down doors and detect you if you stare at them for too long. They're also very susceptible of sounds, so don't attempt to run past them without being seen. And under the worst circumstances, you have to make a run for the nearest chamber and lock yourself inside, alternatively using elements from the environment to block the monster from reaching you.

[h1][u]Summary:[/u][/h1]

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b] + Magnificent atmosphere, the Castle of Brennenburg is a spot that will stick with players for a long time;
+ Great and interesting puzzles, with original solutions;
+ Immersive music and sounds, mixing ambient noises with heart-pumping melody, accordingly;
+ Engaging storyline, may call for a 2nd playthrough in order to fully comprehend it;
+ Terrifying horror element, you are completely defenseless in front of the monsters, they can chase you down relatively quick and kill you in a small number of hits;
+ Unique system of Health+Sanity, in Amnesia you also have to take care of your brain status; witnessing unexpected events, staying in the darkness for too long will drag your sanity down and you will eventually collapse;
+ Difficulty is balanced, the game will not throw its most dangerous enemies at the player until he's prepared to face them;
+ Tons of user-made custom stories, that keep this game's player base alive and bring new, different concepts;

[b][u]Neutral:[/u][/b] +/- The lantern runs out of oil pretty fast, which might prove to be a bother for new players, leaving them facing the darkness for a long time;
+/- Dying has no real consequences; the game saves quite often and it will spawn you back in a safe chamber, along with the items you have retrieved;

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b] - No replay value; after you understood the storyline, there's no real point in coming back to it (besides the custom stories, of course);
- Monsters disappear after a while, which massively takes away from the challenge factor;
- Occasional bugs and glitches, aswell as sound stutterings;

[b]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/b] is a king of horror genre and, by far, Frictional's peak game. Ultimately, we need more games like this.

[b][u]Personal rating:[/u][/b] 97/100 - Masterpiece
I actually do reviews for games on Giant Bomb and PC Gamer... and one game I have trouble reviewing is Amnesia Dark Decent. It's not that I'm indecisive it's just, I can't find the proper words to ever describe this game. You couldn't possibly understand what this game means to me. You might like it and the horror genre would say it's a great game but to me it's more. This game single handedly restored my faith in horror games and got me playing them again. After Resident Evil 5/6 and after Silent Hill Homecoming and Downpour I stopped. Stopped playing, stopped reading up on, stopped caring about horror games. Resident Evil I saw coming but Silent Hill too? This mass appeal mindless action bullsh*t needs to stop. Survival horror was the genre that got me into gaming and then I saw the genre just up and leave us fans for more sales from the Call of Duty players. Action is where it's at? As the head developer for Resi 6 said "Survival Horror games are no longer popular, we needed a new direction and new ideas" well guess what... Amnesia proved Survival Horror still has plenty of new ideas to bring to the genre and proved that the genre is not dead. 
 
Amnesia is art.... it's artwork crafted by brilliant minds. Look past all the fun scary chases and the jumpscares, just look at the game. A first person game that doesn't have weapons? Yeah imagine that. You hide and run from monsters, much like people would do in real life. But if you break down the level design, the choice of imagery, the methodically detailed environments. You will see true beauty within. If I may quote some negative reviews here "water monster wasn't all that great of an enemy, he doesn't even have a character design. It's lazy...." yes they had limited resources however this isn't lazy design choices. The fact that you cannot see the water monster is more terrifying than any other creature in the game. It plays off your imagination, the fear of the unknown. Your mind subconsciously filled the blank with your worst fear which gave this monster so much memorability. The water monster is one of the most memorable moments, everyone talks about it and that's the reason. 
 
After such a horrifying experience with the water monster, what happens? You walk into a well light room with a fountain that supplies the calming sound of running water, a hole in the ceiling with light seeping through (one of the first times you see the light of day in this game), beautiful music plays softly in the background and the room has a tint of blue in the air. This is no randomly designed room, no this is a reward. This is saying "Hey you made it through that horrible experience, breathe relax a bit. You deserve it" and that is something I haven't seen before. No stupid achievement unlocked, no legendary loot, no high score and no misspelled CONGRADURATIONS. In a game that plays on your fear and emotions, they reward with such. They made you crap your pants, now they're making you feel relaxed. And that means more than any achievement. 
 
The story is rich and it plays along with the tension in the game. The enemies aren't scary on the level of a jumpscare but rather the fear of being chased. Jumpscares are cheap thrills, true fear is much harder to achieve in a gamer and much more satisfying for the gamer. They accomplish this in many ways. Never knowing what danger lurks beyond the glow of your lamp, the dark abyss continuously hunts you down, the monsters are not just some scary looking monsters for the sake of "boo look at me I'm scary" they're people you tortured and sacrificed for your own safety against the darkness, their disfigured bodies are representations of the guilt you bare in the deepest parts of your conscious despite suffering Amnesia you still feel it, led astray by someone you thought you could trust, no escape or easy way out the only path is down and it's bathed in darkness as you descend slowly into your past with each step you lost sanity, walls are shaking, the crackling sound of your own mind is louder than your beating heart as you're chased by a horrifying disfigured creature you created, the sound of screeching can be heard when they're getting closer letting you know how close you are to death. 
 
Oh... jeez I... I can go on and on about this game. Hell I want too... but if this gets any longer it will be considered a novel. The best thing I can say about this game? Play it... please. I beg you if you're a fan of horror games, if you like being scared, if you like a good story or immersion or hell if you just want to play a damn good game; play this game! 
 
This is without a doubt my favorite game of all time. The favorite game, not one of. That's hard to say, but it's true. I never game 10 out of 10. I always made fun of other reviewers who did, saying no game is perfect. 10 out of 10 is saying it's the masterpiece of all gaming and cannot be improved in any way, shape or form. However, I've seen my mistake. You don't give it a 10 based on some score that means nothing to anyone else other than you. You're giving it a 10 based on the experience the game gave you. And based on that, Amnesia The Dark Decent was given my very first 10 out of 10.
Whether it was a whim of fate or a crazy idea to understand the appeal of horror on Valentine’s Day, it has taken me six years to finish Amensia, and yet it only took one night against my nerves to overcome it. This anecdote does not describe how terrifying Amnesia is as a game, rather how effective it taps into the fears of the unknown, man’s own worst creation. Had I realized how Amnesia has less to do with survival horror and more to do with walking-sims the illusion would not have become self-inflicting. When you strip away all the smokes and mirrors, it becomes obvious how often the player is responsible behind scaring themselves rather than what is truly happening. 

This statement does not discredit Amnesia as an effective horror game. On the contrary, Amnesia embodies how horror should be treated as it instills dreading anticipation rather than moments to be feared.  

[h1]”Hello, Darkness, My Old Friend…”[/h1]

While some may continue to use the term “walking simulator” as a derogatory, Amnesia perhaps vindicates the idea. Even with the puzzles, the generous resource-management and the “hiding/running” mechanics, Amnesia is a game without much breadth compared to the depth behind its experience.

For starters, the initial hours never rely on enemies to make the player afraid; instead, the usage of background noise and the usage of the darkness/sanity-meter creates the illusion of being pursued. Many would-be horror games fail in their execution to imitate Frictional Games by simply recreating situations of sensory deprivation without manipulating the player. Unless you know from hearsay or you have experienced the game yourself, there are plenty of tricks to never make the player feel alone in the darkness. This attitude is present throughout the game even though players have more mechanics to use and many more threats to be afraid.  
 
While the puzzles become more engaging, the number of forced encounters makes a game devoid of anything other than immersion. It may be surprising to learn 75-80% of encounters can be avoided simply by waiting for enemies to vanish. This aspect does not ruin the experience because it is explained in the lore, yet it often is used to scare the player into a corner or to heighten the tension for a set piece. Aside from a water-monster, a Shadow Chase and one encounter with an Infected, most threats you face do not need to be overcome at all. Some players may find this lack of challenge disheartening, yet the lower number of deaths and the inability to distinguish a fake versus a real threat keeps the illusion intact. However, some levels are narrowed hallways that often showcase this mechanic is a crutch, a design limitation rather than a technical one.

The other mechanics in Amnesia often feel adequate if they only serve the purpose to create a sense of dread. Perhaps the most annoying inclusion is the sanity meter, which would be interesting if it didn’t mess up my mouse and FOV with little gameplay changes. Dark Corners of the Earth utilized this idea with far more interesting consequences. Tinderboxes and lantern fuel are quite abundant, yet there are many instances where you may overuse them. Health potions seems like a non-issue because you cannot simply take more than one or two hits, and if an enemy catches up with you it’s game-over. The inventory system and the “open-ended” order of linear objectives—both of which enhance the puzzles—are really the only additions to benefit Amnesia as a game. 

[h1]Horror, the Storytelling Jack-in-the-Box[/h1]

Aside from various elements of gameplay enhancing the horror behind Amnesia, the storytelling also lends some credit to enhancing the game as a piece of horror fiction. Horror is a genre you have to go into with the expectations that it will attempt to frighten you, which often makes the audience more critical of the plot-structure due to assumptions about subversive moments like almost reaching the exit or about other characters’ motivations. These stories can still be scary because how that fear is conveyed and what you must do creates the tension behind the flimsy plots, which often evaporates towards the end because that discomfort is released. The problem with Amensia’s narrative isn’t that it leaves many mysteries or details unexamined but rather how much subtlety is behind its plot and its motivations for what is a very classic horror story.

Although the term Lovecraftian is misapplied to many horror media, the comparison is apt with Amnesia if you have his Poe-like stories in mind such as The Rats in the Walls. Some unspeakable, unimaginable, indescribable horror manifests itself to the protagonist, which further disrupts his or her mental state over time. Eventually, characters break down, consumed by their disruptive thoughts as they result in a tragic end. Most of the time, these endings are unsatisfying, implying something to the audience as a shocking twist or it may border on the absurd as the infamous “I can hear it coming up the stairs as I write this!” trope. 

Daniel’s story mirrors many elements of this classic plot, and most remain effective. It’s character-driven involving Daniel, Alexander and a host of other victims with an indescribable entity only referred to as The Shadow. Waking up as the new Daniel and how he gets roped into this mess are effective as the Shadow prevents his escape. While the rationale behind the amnesia is never fully explained without extensive lore reading, its purpose does follow the archetype of a character reaching their mental limits. Unfortunately, many elements of this narrative remain obscured by the way information is communicated as well as the lack of context behind the three solutions which both results in an unsatisfying ending. 

Although there are many games before and after Amnesia that relied on notes to piecemeal a plot, the writing is perhaps far too subtle for its own good. Certain mysteries like the Orbs and the castle do not affect the storyline because they are details meant to be left up to the player to answer. Characters outside Daniel and Alexander, however, often will be vague at best due to how they are presented only through snippets of text scattered across the game. The most notable example of this problem is Agrippa who is tied into one of the three endings. Scattered messages give the player some impression, yet when the player meets him it feels as if there was meant to be a stronger connection between him and Daniel. Alexander also only gets exposure through Daniel, so his goal of “returning home” is never given adequate explanation. The only ending that does feel like closure to the narrative is what many label “the bad” ending as it ends the story of the former Daniel, yet it still may seem disappointing as there is no surprise nor does it illuminate the important questions.

[h1]The Oldest and Strongest Emotion of Mankind is Fear, the Fear of the Unknown[/h1]

Although I do not believe I am an expert—nor am I a massive fan—of horror media, Amnesia is an experience that manages to be as evocative of what makes great horror years later. Does that make it one of the best games ever made? Perhaps not if you see through the illusions. 

What should be remembered is why Amnesia remains brilliant. It’s not the emphasis on being helpless; it’s not the violence nor the gore; nor is it the result of its classic horror story. It’s the atmosphere, the immersive elements, and the manipulation of player’s expectations of how to be afraid that shows its pedigree. Fear is an emotion out of the ignorance of what you do not comprehend, dissolved away with knowledge; in the moment from sanity, fear exposes more questions than answers to what being alone in the dark shall ever illuminate about yourself. You may come out feeling a sense of amnesia not off who you are but what you think of the world around you.
A horror game masterpiece that takes away all your feelings of saftey and security and gives you two options. Run, or hide. This is an exceptionally unnerving way to play and will challenge you as fear grips you and you must think quickly on your feet to stay alive! Play at night, alone with headphones, or with a whole bunch of your sissy friends who can't stand horror anything! You will get laughs and screams and your experience will be bolstered if you have two or more people watching you play! Alone though,...late at night? Heh heh heh. That can get to you, especially if you're a little tired, but not so much that you pass out. :P If your mind is already vunerable in some way, this game will take down your barriers and screw with you. It has a lot of psychological horror to it, and some of it has absolutely nothing to do with the monsters and the darnkess that follows you.
This was the second time I played Amnesia: The Dark Descent and I must say it was almost as much fun as it was when I first did, not knowing anything about the amazing story. I now had the luxury to pay attention to the smallest details, submerge into it and finish the additional story - Justine and of course to explore every little corner and unlock the achievements (most people played the game when there were none, as these were added later). So now it's the second time I'm amazed by how good and well put together this game is.

We play as Daniel, a man who awakens in a huge castle in Brennenburg, Prussia (Germany) with no memory whatsoever. No wonder: as we find out from a note (which he wrote to himself), he intentionally drank a powerful potion that caused the amnesia he suffers from. The note also tells him that he must kill Alexander, the baron residing in the castle.
As we progress in the game, we gradually learn - along with Daniel - of his past and the reasons why he decided to forget everything about himself. And as if the menacing castle (which trembles from time to time) and the horrible monsters that roam its hallways weren't enough, there's a sinister entity stalking our hero which must be connected to the blood red goo that seems to appear all over the castle...

The lore built around the game is exemplary. Most of the mentioned characters we won't be able to meet in the game, yet the written texts do a great job introducing them successfuly to us. I've been a huge fan of this type of storytelling ever since System Shock 2. I also loved some small elements, such as how the game tried to correlate a key artifact with the globus cruciger held by medieval european kings.

The first thing we notice in the inventory screen is that Daniel has a sanity meter (a bit like in Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth), below his health. Unfortunately he is extremely easy to scare, so his sanity will evaporate from basically everything: looking at monsters, disturbing images, bones or hearing loud noises, even staying in the dark for too long. Yes, darkness, while it could be our ally it's also our enemy: if we hide from monsters for too long in the dark, we can get spooked. When this occurs we'll experience distorting visual effects, the screen blurs, Daniel starts to gnash his teeth and see imaginary things. This can apply to monsters as well at some locations and these imaginary monsters can actually hurt us. At extremely low sanity we can also slow down or even fall unconscious (which is strangely not as horrible as it may sound). Either way, low sanity is not a good thing and we should stay in the light when there are no monsters around. Our sanity can be replenished by solving puzzles or leaving main areas.
The second thing is that we are completely unarmed. I usually find this a cheap method of making a game scarier by depriving the player of weapons, but in Amnesia it seems somewhat justified and I actually enjoyed it: being defenseless fits well to the tone of the game.

Puzzles represent a dominant part of the game. While there aren't many items we can collect (tinderboxes we can light candles with, oil we can use for our lamp and healing items) most of the puzzles make great use of the physics (much like in Tresspasser or Half-Life 2) the game's engine utilizes (also present in Frictional Games' previous games, the Penumbra series). The quest items are also not numerous but some of them can be used several times (prepare for the most bizzare uses ever) and the game will always tell us whether the item has any function in that exact location or not, so we can't screw up permanently (by filling up a bucket with oil instead of water for example). The physics also requires us to interact the doors, levers, valves and drawers manually, so instead of clicking on them, we have to pull or rotate them by moving our mouse. It's a really nice touch, but it can also be a pain during chase sequences when we have to do something within a given amount of time.
The other things we are going to collect are notes, letters and diaries, written either by Daniel, Alexander or any of the supporting characters of the game. They are necessary to understand the story, not to mention they usually contain the solution to some of the game's more complex puzzles and the key to experience the game's 4 different endings.
A problem I could mention here is that some locations must be visited in order for the full experience (we can miss some notes when the portion of the castle becomes unreachable later).

Strangely death is handled very liberally in the game. Usually when a monster kills us, we don't even have to reload, we'll just wake up in a random location in the area with all our stuff and progress preserved. In addition to that monsters are quite easy to avoid (especially once we learn their behaviours and patterns), most of them disappear completely if we lay low for a while (crouched). That being said, Amnesia requires little stealth, rather a quick and resolute jump behind an object, whenever we hear a monster approaching (they let out a pretty loud howl). Their arrival is scripted, so most of the time whenever we pick up an important quest related item, we can expect a monster to appear close by.

The game also contains an additional adventure (can be reached from the 'Settings Launcher') called Justine. It is related to the main story (both by some characters and the major theme - the Amnesia potion) and a bit more action-oriented. Interestingly, death here is final and once we fail we have to start over, since there's no save feature.
This one is quite short, but contains multiple endings as well and the story is almost as good as the one in the orginal, which I'm not going to spoil, but let's just say after having played Amnesia, we'll immediately know who Justine is and who's giving her instructions :)

The graphics is a bit dated, but still effective and by no means would I call it ugly. It has a certain distinctive look and can produce nice graphical effects, but these extra effects can cause minor slowdowns here and there. Make sure to turn off 'Imagetrail' in the options menu as it ruins the graphics, plus makes the game look choppy.
The dark, menacing, derelict castle makes a perfect location for a horror game and although it loses its charm on some occasion as we descend deep underground, it still features amazingly atmospheric and eerie environments. Some of the interiors are massive and I found myself looking into the seemingly bottomless abyss below several times. I loved the series of paintings and drawings adorning the walls, even though some of them were pretty disturbing (well, it's a horror game :)). There aren't many types of monsters in the game (one of them is invisible furthermore) but they are genuinely scary and I couldn't wish for better ones.

The sounds were equally good, but I did miss one thing: environmental audio. I loved the sounds of the monsters, the occasional tremblings in the castle but they could have been so much more with the proper use of surround sound.

Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a huge step in the history of horror games. I could compare it to Alien: Isolation where I had to take breaks because of its depressive and dreadful nature. It's a classic now and shouldn't be missing from any horror fan's library. And if it's there and you haven't played it yet, what are you waiting for?

PROS
+ excellent story told through notes
+ amazing horror atmosphere, creepy monsters
+ great physics-based puzzles and brain-teasers
+ detailed lore surrounding the main story
+ disturbing insanity effects

CONS
- lack of advanced surround sound
- Daniel is way too faint-hearted

RATING
9/10
Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of the scariest games i've ever played. It's not because of the amount of monsters, either not the jump scares (Fortunately they don't exist in that game). You wanna know what one thing making this game a true masterpiece? I'll tell you, imagination.

Most of the times we are scared, because of things that are simply happening, like for example self-opening doors, windows, creepy screams from the basements of the castle etc. In that situation you immediately think that there is monster nearby, but you just realised that was a false alarm. You can also hear monster's scream, but that doesn't mean that you'll even spot him. Of course all those "warnings" aren't always fake alarms, so player have to be prepared in every moment! It's also a great survival game, you have to looking for items like oil to your lamp, tinderboxes to set fire to torches for example and other items that will help you complete this adventure!

Soundtrack is great, it fit in game perfectly. In my opinion soundtrack in every games HAVE to be good, especially in horror games. I recommend check some tracks on YouTube.

Game has also an option that allow you put some custom stories created by fans (There are a lot of cool maps to play). Also remember that some of the custom stories were making "for fun" and they aren't scary at all, but still worth to play a couple of them, no doubht about it. So if you completed the main game and You still looking for some cool, scary/fun stories to play, go ahead.

I should also say about the physics in this game. You can pickup almost every items you spot, chairs, boxes, bags etc. You can compare that to Half-Life 2, but in Amnesia this one is more advanced.

You should complete this game in 6-8 hours on the first playthrough in my opinion. I recommend looking for as many items as you can spot, since the inventory is unlimited. There is also one small addon called Amnesia: Justine, it's very short (1 hour) but in my opinion still worth to complete.

I rate this game 8/10 (Very Good), not 9/10 because it's scripted game and you won't have same fun playing this game second time since you'll remember a lot of things.

I didn't say about everything, story in game and other things, but this is my first "big" review. Also my english may be not perfect, but I did my best and i'll improve myself in future for sure!

Buy it!

Whenever I feel nervous or anxious I play this relaxing game to calm my nerves. I especially recommend playing this before going to sleep as it will ensure a good night's sleep for you! The overall atmosphere of this game is very cheerful and bright. The maps are filled with great landscapes, ingenious architecture, and friendly creatures and characters. In my opinion it's exciting and constant entertainment for all ages and genders. A great game in every aspect and 100% worth the money! The only con is that a character known as 'brute' is sometimes very naughty.
I started playing this game when the sun finally went down. I put on my headset, shut off the lights and off I went. I finished the game just as the sun came up. I then took off my filled diaper, got a cup of coffee, and called my mother.
1) Start your pc at evening or at night,
2) Turn off the lights,
3) Get good stereo headset,
4) Immerse yourself and play the game.

The game is dark, quiet, slow and confusing. Atmostphere draw me into this game. The game itself is very dark, sometimes you may find candles or just normal lights. This game is after all years still one of the best horror games and shows competition how to do games.

I finished this game for only 7.8h, its not much, but I did everything and I enjoyed it :) .. I can only recommend this game.
The game that will make you crap your pants. At least I'd like to put it that way. The developers have always, in my eyes, succeeded in bringing a true form of horror. That, being defenseless and not knowing what you're about to plunge yourself into.

The Game offers an eerie atmosphere in a Prussian Castle where the main character Daniel awakes after he drank a mixture that'll make him forget, hence the Title. You will however soon find out why Daniel chose to forget, and let me tell you, you would've chosen to forget too. Without any means to defend yourself you're being thrown into a dark, creepy castle full of Horrors that may (or may not) lie around every corner. Was that noise you just heard your mind playing tricks on you? Or was it something far more dangerous. I wan't to be honest, I could barely play the game for longer than an hour without suffering panic attacks, intense amount of fear and dread and lots and lots of foul language.

if you're into Horror Games, don't let this GEM slip by. Many people said this game set the bar for Horror Games to a new high, rightly so. If you don't mind 1st Person and being defenseless, plunge into the minds of Daniel as he explores the Castle to find his true identity, what led him there and why he gave himself the order to murder someone deep down in the castle.

There are also a lot of Custom Stories that can be downloaded and played at the developers forums.

5/5, by any means. If you're a Horror fan and you haven't played/heard of this game yet, you shou-... MUST give this game a try.
[h1]Competent, Unadulterated Survival-Horror[/h1]

+ Atmosphere is palpable and relentless
+ The 'insanity' feature is well integrated into the game's environment, and the restrictive nature of needing to stay within a light-source adds a challenging mechanic to one's adventure
+ The little voice-acting present in the game is superb in quality
+ Graphics and textures, though dated, have aged well
+ Level designs are well-planned and make one feel thoroughly immersed
+ Controls are smooth, responsive, and blissfully minimalist
+ The story has multiple endings to choose from, and they differ enough as to be worth seeing
+ The plot is interesting and incredibly well-delivered
+ Pages and mementos are well-worth the effort to obtain, and do well to enrich the experience
+ Supports custom story-quests

- Save for a drive to see the other endings, there is little incentive to replay the main quest
- Plot is advanced through linear exploration and fetch-quests; this does not necessarily detract from the experience, and indeed this was the intended method of gameplay, but gamers uncomfortable with this style may find themselves turning away from the game due to an underlying tedium

Now i've got my brain back so i bought this game to appreciate your gorgeous work...
Cheers Dev...
Amnesia: The Dark Descent is one of those games that only comes around once all of the planets in our solar system align perfectly - which, is to say, never. But yet Amnesia did come around, and it redefined not just the horror genre itself, but indie gaming as a whole, I think. It showed that first-person gaming fit the horror experience perfectly (in my opinion, even demonstrating that first-person horror is the best possible kind of horror), and with the right narrative and thematic techniques (in both writing and gameplay), could create a rich and beautifully dark universe for the player to inhabit. 

... Assuming the player actually is bad enough to launch the game in the first place, that is. There's no two ways about it: Amnesia is one of the most terrifying games ever created, and that's as much a byproduct of its powerful and compellingly grim story as much as it is a byproduct of its grueling and sinister gameplay. At points you will be overwhelmingly afraid to continue playing, simply because every action and every moment you spend interacting with it, you realize more and more how powerless and incapable you are, and how little resources you really have. There is no combat in Amnesia - there is only survival, and it's as fleeting as it is difficult.

It's not the game for everyone, but I think that all gamers should at least try to experience it; even the first half of it, if not more. It may take you months to accomplish, but a full playthrough of Amnesia can be one of the most rewarding and exhilarating experiences in the history of gaming.
Amnesia is one of the scariest video games I have ever played. Its chilling atmosphere and dreadful threats make it stand out from its other horror counterparts. On top of that, the puzzles make a tense game all the more intense, but not in your traditional way.

Story: The story in this game is extraordinarily compelling despite not being very original. Your name is Daniel, that's all you know as you pick yourself up from the castle floor. As you make your way through the abandoned corridors you come across a note addressed to you. It tells you of a man named Alexander who must be killed by you in order to redeem both your present self, and your past persona. You are also warned of a shadow that threatens to tear reality apart unless your able to stop it. As you journey throughout the castle you will discover sinister threats lurking throughout the shadows that threaten to prevent you from completing your quest of redemption. These include the omnipresent shadow that pursues your stolen power, the evil and twisted agents of Alexander, and the invisible, water dwelling Kaernks that have gotten loose from their confines. As you progress you will find notes and journals that give you insight into what your former peers and you were attempting to accomplish as well as why your previous self came to hate Alexander so much. By the journey's end you will learn of why you drank the Amnesia Potion, and what Alexander's true intentions were. Then you will be given the options to decide the fate of both Alexander's quest, and your own.

Overall Score for Story: 10/10

Gameplay: The gameplay for Amnesia is what differentiates it from the rest of the genre. As you are told many a time, you are unable to defend yourself from the monsters, so your only options are to avoid detection, and if that doesn't work, run like Bill Cosby is behind you. This experience is made unique by the game's sanity meter. The higher the meter, the easier it is to survive as you'll be harder to detect and enemies will glow blue which will help you to evade them. Having low sanity will cause you to be less stealthy, have a harder time seeing enemies, have distorted vision/hearing, and once it reaches rock bottom, you will crumple to the floor for several seconds in a recovery phase that will attract all surrounding enemies to your area, you can get back up, but only if your not killed. The sanity meter is lowered by looking directly at enemies, witnessing unsettling/supernatural events, or staying in the dark too long. It can be recovered however by progressing through levels and completing puzzles. This makes the game an intense experience as your forced to make key decisions at each encounter with an enemy. In addition to this there are a plethora of physics based puzzles that you must endure to progress.

Overall Score for Gameplay: 10/10

Characters: The characters though few in many are memorable and interesting figures. They all have interesting and engaging character arcs that compliment the theme of the game very well. This includes the protagonist, who despite being silent is a deep and tragic figure, an impressive feat considering the average silent player character.

Overall Score for Characters: 9/10

Graphics: The graphics in this game are quite sharp looking at high settings, but at medium or lower begin to look extremely dated (medium settings look like something out of 2007). Its not too difficult to run at high settings with a steady frame rate so you shouldn't have too much trouble unless your on a DS Lite. The monsters are textured poorly but that's not a big deal, especially since your not supposed to look at them. The lighting is alright, but its no Doom 3. It seems that the lights affect a circular area but don't cast convincing dynamic shadows. Overall, the game looks okay, but isn't phenomenal. 

Overall Score for Graphics: 7/10

Soundtrack: The soundtrack is minimal in this game but shows up in all the right places. It truly conveys the intended feeling the game wants you to feel whether it be safe, hunted, or confused. 

Overall Score for Soundtrack: 8/10

Sound: The sound design is really good in Amnesia. Footsteps feel full and heavy, monsters make frightening growls, and the physics objects bang and clash and scrape when you interact with them.

Overall Score for Sound: 9/10

This game is great and a very memorable experience. I believe that anyone who likes the horror genre should give this one a try as it will fulfill everything your looking for in a horror game. Please just don't be one of the people who plays it just for scares and ignores the story (you'd be doing yourself a great disservice). Seriously guys and ladies, epic game.

Overall Score for Game: 9.2/10

If you have any questions about the game, comment on this review.
Do you want a horror game that does not rely on jumpscares, and is genuinly terrifyting? Well this is the game, by far my favorite horror game of all time.
Bought it during the Steam Winter Sale of '12

10/10 would not play again
I had never experianced immersion until I had played this game. I had always sat in front of the screen as events unfolded in front of me. This game was different. I didn't just play the game, I WAS Danial. I felt the fear. I felt the confusion. I felt Amnesia. Everything that happened in this game, I felt like I had done. It struck me to the core. It gave me nightmares. It made me question my own humanity. How can a human being be so terrible I asked myself. Play this game to find out!
1) Turn off the lights
2) Get good stereo headset
3) Put on a diaper
4) Immerse yourself and play the game

You're stranded in a deserted (you wish) castle, trying to figure out who you are, following notes that you left to yourself. In those notes, you urge yourself to descend deeper and deeper into the castle, and while you do so, you learn the horrible truth of what is going on... slowly... slowly learn... equipped with an oil lamp and nothing more. The atmosphere is very creepy, and you have to care for your physical and mental health during the whole game. If you run out of light, you run out of sanity.

There are many puzzles in the game to be solved, collecting objects spread around to unlock a door, and so on. They would be silly in a regular setting, but here you think "Oh horror, do I have to go AGAIN in that dark, dark, dark room?!?!" There are NO JUMP SCARES. You can usually "feel the horror coming" (and after coming; refer to item 3) and then you look... there it is... or nope, there is nothing. Or wait, there is. What was that noise? Where was that? Behind me? No, that things wasn't there before. DAMMIT I'M RUNNING OUT OF OIL IN MY LAMP!

This game does a great job at making the player afraid of exploring some areas, just because you learn it could mean "trouble". Best horror game on Steam I have found so far. 

EDIT#1: I replayed this since they added achievements. No regrets! Achievements are quite natural, but you might want to check a guide to find all Tinderboxes/Notes. There are too many, and some of them are relatively well hidden.
★★★★☆ - "Worth your time, give it a bash" 

PROS:
- The enemy in this game is monstrous, everything about it is terrifying.
- An interesting story told through minimal cut scenes and notes.
- Creepy environments which you can roam around, each very atmospheric with superb lighting and design.
- Restrictive gameplay means you interact only with objects, this adds to the tension as you can't fight back but only run and hide.
- Amnesia is just one big puzzle game, one that doesn't hold your hand and is very challenging. You learn by dying and by reading, listening and experimenting with objects.

CONS:
- As you can only interact with objects I would have liked to had seen more of them, some rooms feel repetitive and if they were to be more dense it could have only added more character.
- A tiny complaint here are the loading screens, as you enter certain areas there are loading screens, they are overly long but as you play more there become more. On a positive note it doesn't distract too much away from immersion as its all just one big place too explore.

VERDICT?
 A very tense experience, not for the feint hearted nor the impatient but a rewarding and intriguing game.
1.Game graphics:   6/10
2.Sound:               10/10
3.Playability:          7/10
4.Climate:               9/10
5.Fear:                   10/10

    Overall rating:    9/10

Frictional Games,you did pretty good job so far.

Post Scriptum:ONE big Plus for hard mode,extreme gameplay.
The best horror game I've ever played. I'll likely come back to this game time and time again for a genuine scare. Props to all of the content creators out there making custom stories for this game and making sure I can be scared and depressed whenever I feel like it.

The story is enthralling, the sound design is perfect, the atmosphere and scenery fit the mood exactly, there's extremely little wrong with this game thematically or otherwise.

(Just ignore the pewdiepie fanboys from 3-4 years ago and you'll be fine).
[h1]The Dark Descent[/h1]

[b]I recently replayed Amnesia: The Dark Descent as it got updated with achievements and decided to write a review afterwards. Amnesia: TDD is an amazing horror game packed with interesting and challenging puzzles, a very eerie atmosphere and dangerous monsters.[/b]


Ingame you have a health and a sanity level, hiding in the darkness decreases your sanity but makes it harder for monsters to spot you, staying near light or lighting your lantern stops your sanity from decreasing but allows monsters to easily spot you, solving puzzles and progressing increases your sanity if you have lost any, but looking at monsters decreases it as well. Once you have gone completely insane you break down on the floor and can't move for a few seconds, this makes it incredibly easy for monsters to get you if there are any around, after getting up again your sanity will be restored to the best possible level. Being hit by a monster or environmental hazard decreases your health which can be refilled with Laudanum, a chemical you can rarely find ingame. Besides Laudanum there are multiple other things you can find, those things include tinderboxes, which can be used to light light sources, notes, which can be read, oil, which can be used to refill your lantern, and various other, mostly puzzle related items. The monsters wander around the levels searching for you, they are attracted by light and sounds, so you should be quiet and avoid lights around them. You'll know when they're around though thanks of the grotesque noises they make. If they spot you they start chasing you, so you better hide quickly because they're faster than you as well! There's also another type of monster that behaves completely different than the others, which you'll have to find for yourself if you do decide to play the game! 

The gameplay mechanics above result in the game being hard but balanced, you can hide in the dark but if you stay there for too long you'll have to suffer the consequences, using your lantern gives you a mobile but limited light source which can be turned off if necessary, but staying near a light source lit by a tinderbox or a natural light source will not consume your precious oil but could put you in a more dangerous situation. While there are a lot of parts where these horrifying creatures hunt you, sadly there are also a lot of boring parts where not all that much is happening, it would've probably been better if the different creatures appeared more often, especially during puzzles, although that could just be me.

Another thing that this game is quite popular for is its amazing physics engine which allows you to interact with almost any object by either taking and throwing it around (small objects), by pushing/pulling it (larger objects) or by opening/closing it (doors and drawers). This results in many precious items being hidden behind a few barrels or inside a drawer and is required in many puzzles. Additionally throwing a box at a monster can give you precious seconds in an intense chase as it stuns the monster for a short period of time.

The story is very deep and interesting and I never skipped a note thinking it would not be worth my time reading the note. The notes generally explain the story very well and pretty much everything is explained throughout the game. I won't go into much detail describing the story itself as that would ruin the fun in exploring it yourself, the store page already provides the necessary story elements. There are three different endings.

Atmosphere is probably one of the strongest elements of this game, not only will the soundscape give you goosebumps but the tension you feel when being chased by a monster or the fear you feel when a monster is walking by is unmet by any other game I've played.

The puzzles are always challenging and interesting and solving them feels satisfying. Especially good are the puzzles you have to solve while monsters are around, these puzzles, besides the atmosphere, are one of the greatest elements in Amnesia. While the puzzles are definitely not easy they are never unsolvable and never break the immersion, you'll always have an idea of what you have to do and if not then a little looking around will give you the hint you need.

While the graphics are definitely dated they are still quite acceptable and especially the light effects look very nice. The monsters look disgusting and really give you the creeps.

The price of 19.99€ totally justifies the average completion time of 10 hours, especially considering the general quality of the game in addition to the free "Justine" DLC and the "Remember" story collection (both of which I will take a look at later) packed with the game. Besides that, due to the freely available in-house HPL 2 engine which the game uses, players are able to create and distribute custom storys which others can download and play, these are officially supported and can be loaded ingame, this allows for infinite horror!


[b]In conclusion, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a masterpiece in game design and a must-have for every horror fan, with amazing puzzles and gameplay, a deep story, an incredible atmosphere, nightmare-inducing monsters and the ability to create custom stories which makes the fun endless![/b]



[h1]Justine DLC[/h1] (spoilers ahead)

[b]In the free Justine DLC you take on the role of Justine Florbelle, a young woman who drank an amnesia mixture and has to pass tests in her own "Cabinet of Perturbation", guided by her own voice she has to survive against three imprisoned suitors and has the chance to either kill or save three other prisoners.[/b]

The DLC is quite different from the main game, it is much more linear and it doesn't have the same atmosphere as the main game, nonetheless it is still interesting and the fact that you can't save the game at all is a nice twist, even though it is still not that hard to beat considering the average playtime of 30 minutes. While the atmosphere is not that good the last chase scene with the third suitor Malo de Vigny (who wants to eat your flesh btw) is definitely the most intense moment in the whole game which will definitely have you drenched in sweat at the end!

While the monsters in the main game only emit animalistic noises the three suitors can speak and despite them having the same model they all have a different personality. The three prisoners have their own personality as well as a story which Justine explains after you've decided their fate.

[b]Even though the DLC is not as good as the main game it is still an interesting experience and worth playing especially considering it's completely free![/b]



[h1]Remember[/h1]

Remember is a story collection containing 5 stories that explain the backstory of Amnesia a bit more, they are nicely illustrated and while it is probably not interesting to a majority of players it is definitely a nice read if you are interested in the story of the game. I think it would've been able to reach a broader audience if it was slightly animated and narrated or even turned into small levels like some flashbacks in the main game but I understand that that probably would've required too much effort to be worth it.

***As a small disclaimer toward this review, though I do not have many recorded hours through Steam for this game, I typically had played it offline and have progressed much further than my online hours would anticipate. Also, I would like to give thanks to Demo_187 and Brother Tasty for proofreading this for me.

Horror game fanatics of many generations know this title to be one of the most influential in the genre. [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent [/i]-commonly referred to as, simply, [i]Amnesia[/i]-is a first-person psychological thriller set in an aged castle-like structure. The player ventures through the massive compound without memory of previous events with the hope of departing said area, never to return. This title is certainly becoming dated, but frets revealing this with its unique exploration approach to gameplay, as well as the ominous theme that persists.[/h1]

Here are a few points of interest in this engaging title:

Atmosphere - [i]Amnesia[/i], unlike other recent horror titles, utilizes much more sophisticated means of psychological disturbances in comparison to the usual mirage demonstrated by jump-scares. As expected, [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i] is quite dark, to the point that extended exposure to dimly lit rooms drains Daniel’s-the protagonist-sanity; this causes the player to expend light sources such as the portable lantern and tinderboxes to illuminate the area. Violent screams and ominous groaning aide in this title’s atmosphere, as these auricle displays may or may not contribute to the actual game experience in ways other than overall feel; whether or not such sounds are relevant can only be determined through play. There are few disruptive sequenced events since each offers context to the game’s illusive story, and Daniel has created a few “Note to Self’s” for the player to find that only add to the unsettling unknown.

Story - As stated, this title’s opening entails the protagonist awakening in a seemingly uninhabited structure with no prior memory of interactions within. From here the player must quest through the house to uncover its secrets. This title-fittingly-is very psychological, maddening even, as the tale is surfaced only by exploring the massive home to horror. Just the right amount of information is revealed through playable scripted events and texts, but the full story remains outside of the player’s reach unless portions of this illusion are pieced together; even so, some questions remain unanswered to service some ambiguity. So as to not reveal anything of major importance, I will halt this segment with these final words: search well.

Trivial Gameplay - Combat-apart from flailing chairs and other loose objects at unmentionable daemons-is nonexistent. [i]Amnesia[/i] advocates primarily as a puzzle mystery game in which player must resolve encounters with cunning rather than physical prowess. Challenges are crafted well enough to accommodate [i]Dungeons & Dragons [/i] campaigns while retaining a similar theme to a remainder of the game. As for the controls, players maneuver with the standard W, A, S, and D key layout while also adding giving simple commands for lifting objects, illuminating wall- and table-mounted torches, accessing in-game menus, and equipping items such as the lantern; it is a simple system, but this sort of title requires no such complexity in having to remember an obscene amount of button combinations.

TL:DR - Challenges range in difficulty from moderate to complex, with an intense atmosphere throughout. [i]Amnesia[/i] is best presented in a dark room while playing alone and utilizing a decent sound system. Uncovering journals, I realized how much I did not know, but also that this most frightening revelations could possibly be recurrent or relevant to the current protagonist’s stride; this game truly knows how to disturb the player. I highly recommend this title to anyone that enjoys explorative mystery, puzzle, or horror titles from the first-person perspective. In my honest opinion, [i]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/i] is a legend in the horror genre, so I would not pass on this title. Thanks for reading.

Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a survival horror video game by Frictional Games, known before Amnesia from their "Penumbra" Trylogy.

In Amnesia we play as Daniel, who wakes up in the dark and empty halls of the Prussian Brennenburg Castle with amnesia. He finds out a note written to himself which informs him that he has deliberately erased his own memory and is being hunted by a "shadow", and instructs himself to descend into the Inner Sanctum of the castle in order to find and kill its baron, Alexander.

If you played Penumbra, you know how gameplay looks in Amnesia as it is really similar. 
The game retains the physical object interaction from it, allowing for physical-based puzzles and interactions like door opening. 
One of the difference is sanity meter. 
If you will stay in darkness for too long, you will witness weird events along the way, or you will stare at monsters for too long, Daniel's sanity will get reduced which will cause hallucinations and drawing the attention of monsters, and I think you don't really want that. 
To restore sanity you need to stay near the light, and if there are none close to you, you can use tinderboxes to light candles, or you can deploy your oil-burning lantern.
But watch out, as you have limited amount of tinderboxes, which you need to get by simply exploring the levels, as for lantern you will also find some oil refills here and there, so to survive you need to do little exploring or to pass levels dark which is really, really harder than it looks.
You can also collect notes that really help in puzzle solving, and pages from Daniel's diary to get that extra lore.
As for monsters, you need to simply hide and wait for a right timing, as they have their own scripted roads and behaviours, if they will spot you somehow, just flee and hide again, hopefully without being torn to pieces by them. 
And monsters can destroy doors in their path and kick obstacles out of the way, so you never know when you are safe or not.

What I like is that game dosen't include jumpscares. 
There is a really, really small amount of them as game prefers to scare you with dark levels and by "unsettelling events". And by monsters themself. I really enjoyed that, as games often use cheap and cliched jumpscares to scare you.
Also it uses "hubs", which are safe and well-lighted places that are put in between dark themed levels so you can have a little rest and be less prepared for scary part.
It works, and here I agree with comment made by developer. 
Putting dark places and jumpscares only in game makes a player slowly to get used to that, making the game less scary.
Here game does a great job of using hubs as kinda "reset" place, where you think you are safe, just to go into a dark trap in a next level.
Sound design, mostly composed by Mikko Tarmia, works perfectly with a theme of a game.
Is it when hiding from a monster, exploring a map, or hearing monsters lurking around, it just fits in a game as it should.

Game includes also a developer commentary, that shares some things from sound desing stuff to some add-on lore. 
It is short and interesting, I recommend turning that option in game if you are interested!
Also it has a "Custom Story" mode, which allows you to play Amnesia mods made by community! Pretty interesting and original, as not many games has that option.

Overall, Amnesia does a great job of being a adventure horror game with puzzle elements, great storyline, and scary monsters that lurk in shadows of a dark, prussian castle to kill you and stop you.
BUT hopefully you don't think game is as scary as pictured by Youtubers, as this game got really, really popular by them mostly.
8/10.

[h1]Intro[/h1]

You want to feel helpless? Have that sense of adreline when you are faced by something that can easily overpower you if caught?

I would recommend amensia to anyone who enjoys a good horror game that is geared towards making you scream.

[h1]Summary[/h1]

+Great Atmosphere (Great music, Graphics, and theme)
+Great Pacing
+Great Mechanics 
+Good Puzzles 

[h1]Fear Itself[/h1]

It is so well focused on all the elements on horror that you are unable to even fight back at the enemy. Forever doomed to listen and feel terror down your spine as you try to find cover or some place to take shelter from the sight of the enemy. 

Another feature of this game to note is the idea of looking at your enemy makes you panic is quite genius. This allows for more realistic scare tactics such as quick glimpses of the enemy, and constantly trying to avoid its attention. 

[h1]Issues[/h1]

While Amnesia is a good horror game there are some glaring faults with the overall game that could makes  the game lose the effectiveness of its horror. Continue reading at your own risk.

[h1]Predictability[/h1]

The issue stems from the predictability of the monsters spawning right after puzzles. Once you realize you're safe doing a puzzle you lose the tension and prepare even beforehand for the enemy to spawns by memorizing some closet locations. When a player sees the pattern the threat itself ceases to be horrifying. 

[h1]Confrontation[/h1]

The other issue is simply when players choose to confront enemies. Seeing the enemy also takes away to the mystery of what they look like and actually brings down the scare factor. Once they figure out how to trick the AI in more ways or simply stop being so afraid. The game design choices have been good to avoid this happening except for the fact that randomized monsters poof once you confront/die to them and you are pretty much safe till next puzzle.

[h1]Flashbacks[/h1]

Flashbacks do not restructure the place to how it would look like before the guy had amnesia. It would be a better visual comparison to see how much the place suffered structurally as a result. 

[h1]Taking Control away[/h1]

Taking control away from the player to demonstrate how the character feels at the moment I feel was a mistake. They do this a few times in the game instead of letting the player himself/herself react. For example in the start of the game when you hear noises above you, your character will fall to the ground with his face near it. I found this really overdramatic and not needed for the already well established atmosphere in this game.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

Overall Amensia despite all the flaws that can occur, is a great horror game that tries its best to put fear in you and prolong the scare with smart tactics that are not blatent jump scares.
+heard funny noise

i can watch these horror films on TV and not bat an eyelid, but this...this is really spooky
This game really creeped me out, but in a good way. Overall it's a good horror experience done without any combat at all. The only disappointment was the "boss fight" at the end. Other than that the game delivers a terrifying atmosphere with great graphics, artwork, writing, and sound.
I've owned this game since launch, before it was on Steam and probably put close to 300 hours in it.

I know this game inside and out.

So my battle scarred heart doesn't find it nearly as scary as when I first played it. However I'll try my best to review it as I would have back after my first playthrough.

Difficulty Normal :4/10
Hard Mode: 6/10

There are no seriously difficult puzzles, there are some that can be solved multiple ways but they're all very straight forward. Some of the difficulty comes in managing your light. No light? Daniel slowly goes insane. Oil isn't uncommon, but the lamp drains it at a surprising rate.

Hard mode makes stuff annoying as hell, but I wouldn't say its really that much more difficult, Just makes it much more tedious. It's even more sitting in a corner than the normal game already is. Know where all the tinderbox spawns are and know where all the monster triggers are and you'll be fine.

Sound: 9/10
The way the game utilizes the "natural" castle noises or Daniels own gasps or teeth grinding really get into your head.
Just the sound of wind blowing a door open can be hair raisingly frightening.

Visuals and atmosphere: 8/10
The HPL2 engine that the game runs on doesn't allow for supremely high quality textures. But what it can use, it uses beautifully. Some of the props look tacky, and the "physics" don't always look the best; but careful care is put into every room Daniel enters. I didn't know that room design could bring unease at the level that Amnesia was able to. Just load any map in the level editor. The detail is astounding.

[spoiler] Monsters: 9/10 [/spoiler]
[spoiler] The grunts are TERRIFYING, even more so if you have the unpleasant misfortune of coming face to face with one.
That groan still sends chills up my spine. 
I found brutes to be not as frightening as grunts, both in model and the noises they make. But they're also so just so well designed. (Obligatory fuck you to the brute at the end of sewers.)
The water monster. The fucking water monster. It's not even a model, it's just a splash animation. But god DAMN was it horrifying. Oh you thought it was over? Keep running bitch [/spoiler]


Story: 8/10
The backstory to the game is told mostly though diary entries that Daniel finds throughout the castle. The rest is told through Daniels flashbacks as he moves through the castle as well as more infrequent notes left by other castle denizens. The story is very lovecraftian; things beyond human comprehension, evils of the universe bringing man to the point of insanity. To get the COMPLETE story you have to read the short stories frictional has put out (found on the games launcher, the button "Remember").
It certainly didn't pan out the way I was thinking it would.


Over-all spook factor. 9/10
The devs know what scares people. 
One of two games that I was afraid to play in broad daylight. (I know I'm a baby) The other being Frictionals Penumbra Black Plague. Two of the most terrifying areas for me [spoiler] The Choir and Storage [/spoiler] took several sessions of playing to complete. This game does horror, and it does it WELL. Play it in the dark, put headphones on, look closely, whats that at the end of the hallway?

[h1]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/h1]

[h1]"They are close..."[/h1]

[h1]Introduction:[/h1]
Amnesia. A true classic and the benchmark by which all other horror games are judged. The main selling point of this game is that in other games you would be scared s**tless by what you see, but in Amnesia it is what you can't see that terrifies you more than what you can see.

It keeps you at the edge of madness and terror whilst at the same time keeps you there without ever pushing you to the point where it because mundane.

[h1]The Story:[/h1]
The story is actually very engaging, with the protagonist being an Englishman named Daniels suffering from amnesia, you find yourself in an old dark castle set deep in the Prussian woods [b](In case anyone doesn't know, Prussia was a German state before the Country was renamed to the German Empire.)[/b]

What Daniels is doing in the castle is up to you to find out, you are searching for answers regarding why you have an Amnesia. But those answers are unlikely to bring you joy.

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
● There is never a time where you won't be afraid
● Very engaging story
● You have to look after your health and your mental health
● You have to keep an eye on your supplies - eg: Lantern oil
● Very well designed and terrifying game areas/levels - eg: Prison, Sewers, Wine Cellar 
● Soundtrack & visuals
● Achievements
● Very immersive
● Very atmospheric
● The darkness will be your best friend and greatest enemy
● Community created stories [b](More playtime.)[/b]
● Price range [b](Sometimes it goes on sale for £2.99, too much of a good deal to pass up.)[/b]
● Puzzles [b](You will stumble upon them whilst traveling the castle.)[/b]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
● Lantern oil [b](The Lantern runs out of oil pretty fast if you don't conserve it. This wasn't a problem for me but it can be for new players.)[/b]

● Death [b](When you die, well. You just die and return to the last saved checkpoint. I wish there was some kind of a cutscene or a better death transition.)[/b]

● Monster disappearance [b](Monsters disappear after a while. Which massively takes away from the challenge factor in my opinion.)[/b]

● A small number of bugs and glitches

● Sound stuttering [b](It happens occasionally. But then again I do acknowledge that this game is pretty old, it did come out in 2010 after all.)[/b]

● No Steam Trading Cards

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Amnesia: The Dark Descent is a true classic old school horror game where it doesn't rely on jump scares to scare the player, but relies on the soundtrack, levels, and the darkness. No game I have ever played has used darkness so effectively. It is both your best friend and greatest enemy at the same time. It will hide you from the terrors, but it will expose you to the insanity brewing in your own mind. Everything about this game works well to produce a true feeling of fear.

If you like horror games this is a must-have. And if you have the balls to play it at night with the headphones and curtains closed. Then you are in for a rough ride. 

[h1]Overall rating 9/10[/h1]
Just watching Pewdiepie you would think this game was just about running away from a zombie thing. I was pleasantly surprised when it was nothing of the sort. An actual story that you have to piece together? Brain tickling puzzles? I went in thinking it would just be jump scares and came out remembering not to judge a book by its cover.
I strongly recommend this game. It has a really nice storyline, this is the kinda of game that you can poop your pants but you still have will to play and reach the end. Just buy it 

8.5/10
I got this game a couple of years back when Steam gifted it, I started to play it but got really scared really fast, I decided to left it there, then last year, I thought about finishing it once and for all, took me a couple of days, as I advanced slowly and with great fear, I finally completed the game, then decided to play it again, so I could catch up with the story and with several things I did not see because I was terrified while playing it.

In Amnesia: The Dark Descent we follow the story of Daniel just as he wakes up in a dark castle in Brennenburg with no memory at all, after investigating for a while, he finds a note he had left for himself, explaining that he took a potion to erase his memory, asking himself to kill the Baron Alexander, the man who lives in the castle, but to do so carefully, as a shadow is hunting him, a living nightmare, something he could not fight, only escape from.

As you advance, details about Daniel's life, the Shadow and several other characters is revealed, leading to the answer of why Daniel drank that potion, a part of the lore is given to the player by text letters found in several places throught the game, these letters give info about Daniel himself, or another characters, some of them which we never meet during gameplay, or some just give information about puzzles, or things we need in order to advance, so in this game, it's important to read carefully to this notes. The other part of the lore is revealed in "flashbacks" or "memories" triggered by doing certain action, or just reaching certain place.

The level desing is beautiful, a dark castle, some of it's rooms are really big, where you could feel really small, others will be quite small, like long corridors, or a small room, it truly is a magnificent place for a horror game. Details like paintings, warrior armors, desing of doors, of rooms, statues, even animal cadavers, it's really beatiful and creppy sometimes, it makes you dive into the world, and feel like you're there. The light effects are good, how torches light up a place, or how a little ray of sun comes through the wooden ceilings, the effects of fire, even blue fire, everything looks good, and they make it even better with shadows. Graphics makes an important point on the player innmersion, and makes you feel the way they should feel.

Game sound, one of the strongest points of the game for me, combined with the graphic desing, it makes you feel scared, the music on the levels is amazing, they use several sounds to make you unconfortable several times, like hearing steps above you, combining it with a cloud of dust that cames from there, little and weird growls that you hear sometimes, and even Daniel himself can say several things randomly in several points of the game, which most of times will scare the f*** out of you. The most disturbing music I've ever heard is the chase music for Amnesia, this being when a Gatherer (this is how monsters are called) sees you and starts chasing you, it makes you completely hysterical, even when you have experienced it several times, it still makes the same effect, you do NOT want to get chased by them. Also the music used when a Gatherer is around is really creppy, you'll know some monster is around when you hear it, and it'll dissapear once the monster's gone. Sounds of the monsters themselves are good, as they always have their mouths completely open, they sometimes speak, saying things like: "Where is him?", "There you are" in a deformed way, they growl all the time, even when they spawn, you'll hear a very specific sound, a distant but powerfull growl.

Something really important to understand it's the sanity meter, this feature takes an important part of the game (it's in the inventory page), it could make your life easier, or harder, as the meter depletes (it's a brain, that gets damaged, and has colors), you'll start experiencing different events, and could mess up with your controls, making it hard to move, to escape. It can deplete in several ways, such as seeing a disturbing moment, like a door brutally opening, hearing some sounds, being too much on the darkness, or just by looking at the Gatherers, the lower it is, the more things could happen, being the worst falling to the ground on the wrong moment, like when a Gatherer just spawned near you. You can experience hallucinations, such as a monster appearing and running towards you, but dissapearing before he can touch you, or seeing bugs in places, hearing sounds, or Daniel just freaking out, making sounds with his teeth, heavy breathing, feeling dizzy. It can be replenished by making progress in game, or staying for a long time in the light.

The tactics in this game are simple, you CANNOT fight any of the Gatherers, you can simply run and hide, there´s no way to defend yourself from them. Monsters run faster than you, so you can't win a race against them, it is best if they don't see you at all, that way you can crouch and move to the darkness, or hide in a closet, behind some door or behind a wall, thing is, if they see you getting to a room and closing the door, or getting inside a closet, they'll go and hit it until you die or they break it. They can hear the noises you make, if you drop a box, or hit a wall while carrying it, they'll come there to investigate and look around, same if you jump, they'll do a "WROARARAR?" and go to the sound location, if they can't find you after a time, they'll leave, so be sure to stay hidden until the searching music stops.

The game itself doesn't have very much items to grab as other games, there's quest objects, tinderboxes to light up torches or candles, health potions, and there's sanity potions (I never found one in the main story), they're popular on custom stories.
Some quest objects are reusable, and you'll need them in several places, until they aren't needed anymore.

Monsters: in this game the monsters are creppy and scary, there isn't a big quantity of them, due to the 4 or 5 monsters included in this game are really good, scary and they work perfectly as they are, there's no need for more. They are heavily disfigured, big claws, ugly faces and bodies, metal pieces attached to their limbs, more letal as the game advance, faster than you, bigger than you, they're plain scary, you do not want to be close to one of them, as you learn the story behind them, it makes it worse.

Amnesia: The Dark Descent has 4 possible endings, it's in you discovering them all, they all have different points and give different perspectives in what you think would be the best, so it's cool to visit them all.

PROS: 
- Beatiful graphics.
- Magnificent music/sounds. 
- Excelent level desing.
- Amazing story.
- Has Custom Stories made by players.
- Interesting puzzles, not super hard, not easy.
- Has everything that a horror game should have, and gives the feeling a horror game should give.
- Controls are good.
- It never gets boring.

CONS:
- Some of the graphic options could give fps drops.
- If you're fast enough, you could finish it in 4 hours.
- If you're someone how doesn't like to read, then you'll have a rough time.

In the end, Amnesia it's a game you HAVE to play, it has way too many things that makes it an awesome game, that you need to enjoy in every aspect, absorb it all. And it's a game that you'll wanna revisit from time to time, and it still will give you the same feeling as the first time you play it.

Overall result: 10/10.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Is still one of those very scary games that I play or 'use' to play because... instead of relying on jumpscares, it realies solely on your psyche. Never play this game in the day time and without headphones. To get a real feel of terror: play it in the dark, sound turned up and with headphones on.

I won't spoil the story because the game's centeral focus is to scare the living crap out of you. And the game does that, while most will say "what's the big deal. It's just sudden flashes of paranoia, etc" first of all, this game takes place in a creepy castle which some of you are probably eye-rolling but that actually made the game, back in it's day, the best thing about it. It's creepy, barely lit. There are sounds everywhere and nowhere. You have to rely on a lantern. Heck, some go pro and actually play the game without using any light sources. Plus like I previously mentioned it heavily deals with the psyche, what you see or may not see in front of you, etc. 

I can go on and on. This game still stands as one of the best horror PC games to get for the horror fans.
I put off playing Amnesia for a long time. It's the first and one of the only games I've ever played where you are totally defenseless against the enemies, with your only option being to run and hide. This did not sound appealing to me on paper. But I have only ever heard good things about the game and when I finally decide to sit down and play through it, I was mostly pleased. I can't say I enjoyed having limited supplies, but it does sort of lend a sense of urgency to the procedings.

Amnesia is the story of a man named Daniel who awakens in Castle Brennenberg with no memory, finding a note from his past self that he must find and kill the master of this castle, Alexander. But getting there is no easy task. The castle is alive with shambling horrors, as well as some phantom presence that is pursuing Daniel, manifesting as disgusting meat moss over parts of the castle. Using only his wits, an oil lantern and scant supplies, he must make his way to Alexander's inner sanctum. Not only must enemies be avoided and health managed, but Daniel's sanity is also in question and looking upon Alexander's minions or even standing in the dark for too long damages such, while solving puzzles and progressing through the game restores it.

Aesthetically, Amnesia is quite compelling. What it lacks in raw graphical prowess it makes up for in excellent sound design, interesting narrative and oppressive atmosphere. The game cleverly accounts for the semi-goofy appearance of its enemies by making it of paramount importance NOT to look at them. There is a vague sense of "otherness" throughout the experience that makes it feel something that's more then standard gothic horror, but not explicity so, at least not early on. While I preferred both the second Amnesia game and it's spiritual successor SOMA, something about The Dark Descent's cold cobblestones, flickering torches and creaky doors interested me even before I had played the game itself.
I actually completed this game tonight. I have owned it for 5 years, and started it now and again, but got only so far and then thought "well, thats enough for me".

Well, I braved it. I said nope, I'm doing it this time. And I am bloody glad I did.

Despite being 6 years old now, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is still a solid, good looking, great sounding, first person horror game. You wake up in castle with no recollection of where you are and why you are here, but you soon learn more as you descent further into the deep bowels of this forbidden place. Along the way, you have some relatively simple puzzles to overcome, while the odd puzzle or two present more of a challenge. 

And it is true what they say, this game is just plain scary. I truly felt fear in this game like no other game has accomplished, and this is achieved by a combination of jumps, creepiness, fear of the unknown, fear of being chased, panic, a gloomy atmosphere and some utterly brilliant audio work.

I can't describe the gameplay and the mechanics without underselling the game at the same time. The only way to know what it is like is to just play it, and trust me on this - it really is one of the scariest things you'll play.

Highly recommended.
This game is amazing. The game takes advantage of all the little details of human nature not usually included in video games. If you like a little fear and solve puzzles, this is the game for you.

This is the first game I've got on Steam and it's my all time favorite game I've ever played.
It may not be my most played game, but any amount of time I'm able to get in this makes me very happy.

Amnesia does a perfect job at the type of atmosphere it's going for. It's not the prettiest game, but it looks very good eitherway. The monsters are very scary, and although I'm pretty much not scared of them now with the time I've put in, it still invokes fear and stress into me when I'm getting chased down by one. 

The controls are perfect. Everything is mapped to buttons that make sense, and you have the option to rebind them all. It feels really well to move and do things, and it also has support for controllers.

It gives a generous amount of oil for the lantern and tinder for the candles for new players to have a pleasant experience going through it instead of being forced to sit in darkness like some horror games may do. Some may argue that would be a better thing to do, but I don't think so. And if you want that, play it's newest mode: Hard mode. 

The monsters aren't THAT stupid. They have limited vision and whether they're able to see you or not will depend on if you're crouching, standing, moving, and whether or not you're holding your lantern out. Oh, and they've received a bit of an AI change in the newest update. They're officially slightly smarter than they've ever been. If you hold an object in front of you to block their hits, they simply won't hit you unless there's a clear opening. 

The environment is completely interactable, you're allowed to pick up just about every object and throw it around, typically not being too heavy. You can pretty much pick up anything and toss it across the room, and there are breakable objects too such as bottles. Some objects you can't pick up but you can slide across the ground at a rather fast pace.
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DO NOT PICK UP OR MESS WITH MATTRESSES THEY WILL STRETCH INFINITELY ACROSS THE ENTIRE MAP, TOUCH AND INTERACT WITH EVERYTHING, DESTROY ENTIRE WALLS AND DOORS AND DELETE ALL PICKUPS, AND DROP YOUR FRAMERATE TO 1 FRAME PER FEW MINUTES!!

Also you can create custom stories and import your own custom monsters and other models into the game to make your own world with voice acting and custom actions, and... CUSTOM STUFF. Or you can be like me and play every custom story two or maybe three times and get 700 hours on the game like I did.

12/10 brilliant game.
A good balance between story, exploration, puzzles and spookiness. It's not just a mindless horror with focus on jumpscares, that's not what the game excels at. There's history connected to all places you go, that is what makes it so intriguing. It's a well-rounded and immersive horror game experience. Recommended, get it now while it's on sale!
One of the Best Horror Games

+ Great Atmosphere
+ Interesting Story at the beginning
- Disappointing Story at the end
+ Few jumpscares, but they are well placed
+ Adrenaline Rush
+ Great mods 
- Some puzzles are frustrating & irrational

8/10
a very good experience for horror lovers
I was chased by an invisible water monster. I threw a bible at it and the creature bled.

10/10 - Would throw another bible to induce bleeding because IF IT BLEEDS, WE CAN KILL IT!


Jokes aside, Amnesia: The Dark Descent is an atmospheric horror game. Like the advice recommended upon starting the game up for the first time, you do not play to win. Rather, you play to survive. There is no difficulty setting and there are no quicksaves whatsoever, just the usual autosaves and the ability to save once to exit the game. This allows players to not worry too much on when to save and focus more on survival.

The sounds in Amnesia have been worked very well. Upon playing in the dark with headphones, the immersive abilities of the game kick in. The constant echos in the stone castles or creaks on aged wooden planks remind players they are in an ancient castle where help is so far away. Literally, the only way to be comfortable for a moment is in a properly confined room with a lit candle...or the closet. 

Why the closet? Well, there are enemies in this game...and they are legitimately scary. Hardly anything competes against their hideous apperance and merciless intentions to seek and kill you. I dare you to stare face-to-face at a humanoid being who has reptile eyes and its lower jaw has been detached from its face. Oh and, it hates being stared at because if it sees you, it will try to slash you. 

There is almost no way to run if such an encounter occurs. Just throw something at it to stun and then run like hell. Or, if you are lucky, hide in the closet and beg for mercy. When the monster attacks you in the closet, you will know sh!t hit the fan so hard, it's everywhere and out of control. Why are there no weapons in the game? Having even a knife would ruin the scare factor and the game would not be so scary anymore. 

While avoidng enemies, exploration is the key to find essential but quite rare items. Light (and typically the closet) is your best friend but the lantern consumes so much oil and jars of it is so rare, nothing can make you happier if you find one. There are tinderboxes to light up torches and candles but beware. They cannot be put out unlike the lantern and you really do not want to be in a well lit room when a monster comes in growling. 

Of course, it would seem like common sense to not use the lantern and lit up dark areas. Upon doing so, your sanity can be drained faster. At the lowest level, it then works against you and cannot be repaired or reverted when trying to stare at a lit up candle, only nullified. At high insanity, hallucinations take over and can appear more often than the real threats and your movement and literally stop. This leaves you helpless...especially when a monster is nearby and you need to run or hide. As such, making progress, such as finding an quest related item, is the only thing to help the poor soul of Daniel.

Who is Daniel? He's an unlucky chap who was pulled into this mess. Avoiding too many spoilers, he decided to drag himself into an ancient castle and after terrible events, Daniel must pull himself together and kill the person mostly responsible for his predicament. He can't leave the cursed castle until this is done. As such, to learn about his past which he erased from his memory, there are notes scattered about and flashbacks that depict the horror before the game starts. In a way, this breaks the fourth wall because reading them helps to soothe the player's paranoia in the real world upon playing the game for so long!

Eventually, the main storyline/campaign gets boring when one memorizes where the monsters spawn and such. Thus, the game introduced the wonderful feature to install custom stories. Some of them, which, are even more terrifying than the base game. You've been warned.

The only complaint I had was some of the gameplay features. Closing and opening a door, for example, takes some getting used to. Instead of pressing "e" to interact, one needs to press "use" and then use the mouse to open it at a desirable speed. Thankfully, there is some time to practice that at the very beginning of the game.

In conclusion, these traits are what many games and movies lack, especially Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs. Thus, I highly recommend Amnesia: The Dark Descent who want a refreshing horror experience.
Are you looking for a game that is different than all those other horror games out there? Well, you don’t need to look further; Amnesia: The Dark Descent is that game. This game is truly horrifying, unlike most horror games out there, Amnesia isn’t a horror game that is full of cheap jump scares. Amnesia: the Dark Descent is that game you shouldn’t be focused on playing the game to win; you should be focused on being submerged into this big, dark, and petrifying world. Amnesia’s scares are ones that last, making your hands shake and evermore aware of your surroundings. These long lasting scares, however, are evenly put out with the unique puzzles in the game. Nothing ever feels better when you solve an elaborate puzzle, and move onward to the next. You cannot fight your enemies; you should either run like hell, or hide. From solving puzzles, dodging monsters, and keeping an eye on your sanity. Every chamber just takes you ever deeper into the abyss of what’s called Amnesia: The Dark Descent. 

Is the Main Story too scary? Or are you bored of it? Don't think that you're done yet, because the horror doesn’t end there. You can go online and download custom stories, made by users to scare other users and to make the Amnesia experience a better one. 

10/10
Definitely worth the purchase for you horror game players
Starting off.. Well to find a really good horror game is one of the rarest things these days, but "Amnesia: The Dark Descent" hit the marks and goes beyond all my expectations.

Turn off your lights, put on some headphones and solve some amazing puzzles or get scared to death by this awesome game, if you’re still sane after playing this, maybe you never were sane to begin with^^

10/10

A realistic experience, no other game has given me this amount of stress.
Brilliant graphics, surround sound and excellent color schemes make this game what it is.
I recommend this game to any horror lover looking for a game where you can truly feel as-if you are in that situation.
Thanks for making this great game.
Amnesia : The Dark Descent is a blend of adventure game elements such as exploration and physic based puzzles in a horror themed environment. They complement each other well, as the places you wander through get gradually more terrifying, the fairly unconvoluted riddles help you ease the tension that can become almost unbearable at times. This is where this game shines, the pace is skillfully mastered, even if you have difficulties persisting in horror games you might very well finish this one. The design is tighly knot around exploration, lightening candles and torches to ward off the darkness, finding the scattered pieces of the story and a death mechanic inconsequential to your progress. The game manages to fill you both with a sense of curiosity as you descent further into the abyss to unravel its mysteries, and a sense of dread to what awaits you in its darkest recesses. You won't be disappointed by its climax.

Amnesia : The Dark Descent is a very enjoyable and rewarding experience, yet a highly unpleasant one, reaching that difficult balance each horror game aims to find. It lasts 7 to 8 hours, and there is the possibility to play custom stories, which I might review here as I go through them.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent

Just a few times in the journey of life have I been so captivated and pulled in to an experience that is never to forget. Even though if you are avoiding scary games the immersive level of the presentation and amazing story will push you to keep on trough the psychological terrors that test your limits of how far you are willing to go to reach the end. Is there salvation, is there hope to get out of this nightmare? After all a big part of life is also about pushing through whatever is thrown at you and  rise to a new level of mind and strength that you couldn’t reach without being tested and brought down thousands of times.

It will provoke thoughts and fear like no game before. For the atmosphere delivered by this game alone it would be a 10/10. If you are an immersive player like me, prepare for a ride that you can´t be prepared for. This level of quality horror is reached when Developers give their best to keep you guessing, immersed, curious about what is next without relying on sudden cheap tricks but doing it in style combined with lighting and Sounds that the true terror is what you imagine in the darkness and not what is actually there. But without spoiling anything what awaits in the darkness will be the kind you won’t forget even long after you reached the end...

The technical part for the year of the game coming out is almost flawlessly done. New milestones were reached as far as sound goes and some one of a kind lighting effects that ties in to the presentation perfectly. Texture wise there could be more detail for my liking but that is a minor issue. The impression overall is what counts.  

Gameplay works well, is intuitive and again very immersive as you can move around things in the world to your liking and protection as well as peeking through doors like you would in real life. The tasks are challenging and rewarding on its own. There is good content and thought behind the story that connects the deeper becoming terror perfectly to the end. 

The Soundtrack is almost as good as the game itself and tells a story on its own. 

What a long journey indeed it is so that many will not want daring to go through a second time. We want to protect us staying sane after all. It is about a long one time play through that you will always remember. I honour the team behind this game. It makes the top 5 Games of all-time list for me. If you haven’t played it I am jealous that you can go through this gem blind for the first time ) .. for me it will be remembered und respected deep down in memory. 

Greetings from Germany, 

10/10


i love this game , what makes this game so scary aren t really the monsters , i saw even worse lookin , but its spooky atmoshere, alone in that castle , having memory flashbacks , seeing wierd things happening , like doors self open , books flying , wierd shadows , and the screen turning red, white , and hearing things like screamings, crying people , guts , and hell if your character sanity gets too small , he will start seeing and hearing wierd things , and those halucinations , basically you see a monster , it runs after you, it scares the shit out of you , and when he is about to hit you, he dissapears , and you realised it was a halucination , horror masterpiece
Scary. No cheap jumpscares. Play at night. And to add on i will say im not easily scared, (but startled), This game is fucking so scary i actual cried.
Frictional's previous series, "Penumbra" consisted of mild Lovecraftian elements in a modern-day setting with some sci-fi laid on top of the framework.
The Dark Descent cranks the Lovecraft up to 11.  I checked, Wikipedia's list of themes of "Lovecraftian Horror" are almost all present in this story.
-Preoccupation with viscerate texture?  Check.
-Antiquarian writing style?  You got it.
-Detachment?  More than ever.
-Helplessness and hopelessness?  Pretty much the basis.
-Unanswered questions?  Don't try to understand what goes on in Brennenburg, it'll only drive you mad.
-Sanity's fragility?  You have NO idea.
-Questionable parentage?  Of course.
Frictional's castle romp will have you doing two things:
A) Hiding in a corner from some nameless terror that growls and slobbers at you from the dark
or
B) Solving puzzles to progress.
The puzzles are by no means obtuse but they aren't the easiest thing you'll do.  Read everything you find and pay attention to what you hear and see, but for fuck's sake don't stare at something if you don't think you should - here's why:
The game's sanity effects system is pretty fucking good.  Eternal Darkness good?  Maybe not.  But you've got a good enough reason to stay in the light and keep your prying eyes away from the things that should not be.  Gritting teeth, insects, insane ramblings, even hallucinated enemies are all consequences you'll pay if you try to pull some Rambo shit.
In true Lovecraft fashion.
There's a reason this game blew up and caused a rebirth in horror games when it came out, and it's not just because of Youtube.  It's because it's good.  Play it with headphones on and get lost in the story, then try not to get lost in Brennenburg.
one of the scariest games ever made.

i make it a tradition to play it on the month of october to scare myself.

if youre into horror this is a must have game.
10/10 Rating 

This game truly chills you to the core.
Amnesia: The Dark Descent, a first person survival horror about discovery and living through a nightmare. 
You’re going to need a week to recover from this game. It is really hardcore. Not recommended for casual gamers.
This is the best horror game I've ever played. It is all about the atmosphere, ambience and the story. The way that Frictional Games keep pumping the tension during the game is just brilliant. The game is really immersive and if you get into it, you get into the story, get into the feeling of the main character, you'll be fully immersed and will feel all the horrors and fears that awaits behind every corner. That's what happened to me. Being adult, I have never been so frightened by any of the media content: either it is a movie or a game. But the Amnesia: The Dark Descent literally made me be afraid and really swet because of the tension.

And there are no cheap techniques like so-called "jump scares" or anything I can remember of. All the scary feelings are invoked by the game's atmosphere built by amaizing art and graphics, brilliant ambient and sound effects, intriguing story and gameplay elements. It is your mind which, upon this all, will build inside the conclusions of the upcoming danger, which will may or may not happen. But you'll never know what is it this time: true danger or you're deluding yourself.

Worth to mention that gameplay is built upon the idea, that you can't fight and directly resist your enemies with weapon. Therea are no weapond, no direct fights, no health bar, no danget indicators. And me personally like this idea and gameplay philosophy of Frictional Games, which they evolved from the great Penumbra series (in the first game you actually could fight, but avoiding it was the best option all the time). And alongside the dark atmosphere and unknown danger, when you don't know what is happening, who you may face with, and what it will cost you, the best idea that you would come up with in such situation in real life - is try to hide, or somehow avoid the danger, or run as fast as you can. You wouldn't stop to check out whether that butcher is gonna slaughter you or give you a hug.

If you liked what I have described, you should definitely grab and play this game (it's free right now)! There is much more! And I'm sure that upcoming SOMA will be another horror masterpiece. Thank you Frictional Games!
Very spooky. Not jump-scare filled, and effectively emmersive, so when fear comes, it is real! Very story driven as well - I found myself wanting to find more letters to read to discover what on earth is going on rather than rolling my eyes at a bunch of words I have to read.
[b][i] Amnesia: The Dark Descent [/i][/b] is a hardcore survival horror game from 2010 developed by Frictional Games,the same guys who did the Penumbra series,so they have a reputation among indie/horror developers,along with years of experience on how to create seriously depressing and horrifying worlds. This review will be on the short side,because just about 15 thousand other people have said everything about this game,I am just here to put my two cents in,in fact,I feel obligated to write at least a few paragraphs,since this game deserves attention and respect,it is a staple and a benchmark by which all other horror games are judged. Basically it reformed and created a new sub-genre among horror games (and also because it took me 4 years to play it through,you can laugh now,yeah).

Now,I'm not gonna spoil the story for you,but rest assured,it is engaging,mysterious,and interesting enough to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout your descend into darkness. The Lovecraftian elements are obvious here, mixed with some heavy influence from Poe (namely the setting itself,among others). 
You are Daniel,an archeologist hailing from Britain,London. You wake up in the middle of the night in the castle of Brennenburg,located in East-Prussia. Hindered by amnesia (and probably some anxiety/paranoia),chased by an obscure shadow,your quest is to uncover a big mystery, what the hell happened to you,why are you in that old,decrepit place,and ultimately,to survive this living nightmare.

In the following section,we are going to take a look at the gameplay, the quality of the visuals/audio design,and the atmosphere.

The gameplay itself is simplistic yet your heart will probably skip a few beats. Seriously,this game is not for the faint of heart: you do not have means to defend yourself in any way,your only options are to either run,hide,or die. Your only friends are your trusty lantern and tinderboxes. You can utilize these in a way so that you won't go insane from total darkness surrounding the halls and passageways (at one point,torture chambers:p) of the castle. But beware,because if you stand in light,the monstrous creatures roaming the château will spot you with ease. There are the occasional puzzle segments,which are not too shabby,it gives you a little pause between discovering the place and shitting your pants.

With that out of the way,let's talk about the technical side of things: usually,when it comes to the graphics,I can be a little nitpicky,I'm not the "anything goes" type of guy,the visuals of a game can either immerse or put me off. Sometimes graphics don't matter,but we are talking about Amnesia,a game,in which the story is partially told and progressed with the medium of visuals. The guys do not disappoint,they did a stellar job in this department. I am not saying that the textures are Crysis/Shadow of Mordor/xy quality,but the way the game handles the lighting is nothing short of amazing.The atmosphere is heavy,crushing,morbid,other-worldly. It is mandatory to play this piece of art with the lights off,headphones on. 

Yes,headphones. If you are playing any other way,you deserve to get dragged out to the street and beaten with a stupid stick. The sound,music and the ambience is amazing. Men,women,children screaming in agony,the growl of monsters,walls cracking,wood creaking,chains rattling,inexplicable noises coming from the end of the pitch black hallway. It is all here. Enough said.


Ultimately,Amnesia is not just a game. It is a dark,terrifying tale to be experienced. If you think,you have the guts,the perseverance,and the love for the genre itself,go right ahead,enter Brennenburg. Just do not forget your name and your lantern.
A horror masterpiece.

No game has made me scared in years. I totally recommend this game!

10/10

NEWS: You can now play Amnesia: The Dark Descent, and Amnesia: A Machine For Pigs on the PS4 thanks to Amnesia: Collection on the PlayStation®Store!
Good story. Creepy gameplay. This game does not throw at you cheap jump scares. Use your oil and tinderboxes wisely! 10/10 would erase memory to play again!
[u][b]Amnesia: The Dark Descent[/b][/u] a first person surival horror made by Frictional Games in 2010.

Pros
+ Great and Scary Story
+ You can download Custom Story!
+ Graphics looks cool!
+ Music and sounds are very scary!
+ Hide and run! (You need hide all the time if you see a monster or he see you)
+ You need keep eye on Hero's sanity! So you need explore levels for searching oil
+ Lots of locations
+ Some types of monsters
+ Inventory
+ With everything you can interact

Cons
- You need defibrator
- Some pants

[u][b]Buy or dont?[/b][/u] Of course buy! but before you need buy defibrator too ;(

Amnesia has become a classic in indie horror games. Grim medieval dungeon atmosphere, great use of lighting/environment and proper puzzles that keep you moving. Best part, there is no combat. You can run, hide or divert attention, but you can’t kill or fight the scary monsters. A very well balanced, unforgettable horror experience with a decent narrative.

The voice acting is bad and the story feels a bit wonky (I personally think the whole extra-terrestrial stuff was a bit naff), but the actual gameplay is great. You can't fight the enemies, leading to some very scary and intense moments. Making your way through areas, wary for enemies. The use of darkness is fantastic. You move through shadowy passages and grim halls, with nothing but your lantern and the tinderboxes. Your only illumination is provided by a thin circle of light around your character; your limited supply of oil means you can easily be plunged into darkness. This is one of the scariest horror games I've played. I definitely recommend it.
If you have some spare cash, and you want a scary game but their aren't much scary games around. Buy and play Amnesia:  The dark descent. There is a lot of story behind the game.

This game is based off the times from somewhere around 1500's - 1900's (I am guessing) and for times like that it actually isn't boring, I got this game for $20 and loved playing it and still do love playing it.

*************T H I S***** M A Y***** B E ***** C O N S I D E R E D ***** S P O I L E R S****************
The dark descent comes with 2 other game modes, you play as a man around the age of 18 - 28 his name is "Daniel" and the other game mode you play as what I assume is a female (from what I remember) and you're in a dungeon thing. But there is someone/something after you. In order to survive you must do stuff that may be MA 15+ or even worse...
**********************************************************************************************************

Q: Do I personally recommend this game?
A: Yes! Very much!
Q: Is this a good horror game?
A: Yes, probably too scary for some people.
Q: Is this worth $20?
A: Yes very much!
Q: Does this game come with mods?
A: Yes, but you have to know what you're doing when adding mods to this game. (You can find it under Custom Games)
Q: Are there more of these games?
A: Yes.
What a rush. The atmosphere of Amnesia is so immersive you won’t want to stop! The quests are challenging but achievable, and the story really reels you in. I loved investigating all the cool/scary/disgusting/weird/disturbing rooms. You need to play this, its unmissable!
my story:

-Buys game
-Reads reviews
-starts game
-15 minutes into the game
-*fuck this shit im out*

Conclusion:
Game is scary. Saw the weird ass monster thing and pissed my pants. If youre scared like me, FAM DONT GET THIS. *this game is good for people that aint scared like my shitty ass*
Pros: Good atmosphere
Decent scares
Interesting Story (to a degree)

Cons: Falls flat in the finale
Puzzles are simple, almost too simple
Left the game with a lack of overall challenge/enjoyment given the ending 
The "all you can do is hide" shtick gets old after a while
I received this game in a humble bundle. I hate it, because this game scares the shit out of me. I felt very helpless and I don't need that when I want to have fun with some games.
