Ask me why this game is more expensive than csgo.

because playing surf with friends, meeting other players in community servers, high fps, smooth game, and alot alot alot of fun, is greater than the difference of 5$ and showing your skins to other players and treating them with disrespect.

Highly recommended game, but the time has ended for css :( miss this game forever.

This game created a family for me in this online world.

The game is..."ok", it's not bad and not very good, mixed feelings - Textures, etc. are pretty basic. Of course it's old, but stays a good game!

This game was everything in my childhood, and is still a classic now with many players still in ALL game styles.

Let me try and break this down best I can to give you wonderful people of the Steam Community EVERY reason to buy this game:

First off, let's talk about the million-and-one game modes you can play. Normal, bhop, surf, zriot, ze, zm, hideandseek, mg, hoejus,, fy, gungame, scoutsknives, awpknives etc. - which were all community made including the maps, with NO EXTRA COST! Just head on into the server browser, and enjoy.

Next, let's talk about how the community is far from toxic. If we look at CSGO currently (whether it's casual or competitive, at whatever ranking stage) - there is always one who wants to be billy big b0ll0cks and talk smack to everyone else, or be loud, grief etc etc. In this, there are still... Wait for it...

DEDICATED SERVERS! Admins can mute, kill, kick and ban this minority, leaving you to get on with the fun.

If you're not one of these people who want to play the many different game modes offered in this, and still want good, olf-fashioned hostage or bomb Counter Strike, not to worry - it's still there! Only you don't have to pay monthly or sign up to a website to have the option to play 128 tick servers - that's the norm for this game *cough* 64tick CSGO *cough*

Overall, I have had MANY hours of entertainment (and still do), I've met many friends whom are now very close and even travelled to different countries to meet them, and I do, have, and always will recommend this Counter Strike to absolutely anybody. 

Thanks for reading! Happy gaming. :) :)
I recently started to play CS:S again and I switch from CS:GO to CS:S from time to time depending on my mood for that moment. The first very important thing that came up to my mind was how friendly the community still is. In CS:GO I rarely join a server where people just play their game and have fun in a joyful harmony with a friendly atmosphere. No salt, no toxicity. I recently played many hours and nobody was calling others noobs or were insulting anyone whereas in CS:GO even on simple Deathmatch servers there are these toxic kids in delayed puberty judging everyones gameplay without any provocation. Then you have these blatant cheaters even in casual mode, joining especially at nights to wallbang ace every round just for the trolling fun of it.
Seems like the real CS community, where people only bother about having fun, no ranks, no skins, with cizilized behavior is in the servers of the good old CS 1.6 and CS:S servers. Awesome people. Thank you guys for keeping CS:S alive.
No loot boxes, progress bar, or unlocks. Just straight up fun gameplay and reliable game mechanics. Another classic must-have game from Valve. Yes people still play this game in 2018, it is still relevant and worth buying.
My first game to play using Steam back in 23/09/2005, (this and Counter-Strike).  If you wanted to play CS online MP, then we had to go through Steam.  You buy the CDs from the stores, input the CD keys into Steam, and then we could game all through the night!  Good Times
Playing with bots:

-Easy: They take their long sweet ass time to aim and shoot right next to you.
-Normal: A bit faster and better
-Hard: It's getting a bit more serious, but still fine !
-Expert: They do f***ing 360 headshots by jumping off a damn roof, and if they see a single tiny pixel of your character on the bottom right of their screen, they'll instantly know you're there and will headshot you from the other side of the world, whatever the weapon they use is, they can sometimes see through walls and hiding with a smoke grenade will be as useless as rushing to them with a knife.

   I only have 240 hours on this account but I used to play Source a TON on my brothers old account. So many sleepless nights were spent playing this with new friends met in game. I wish I could get those times back.
Still a great game even 2 years after the launch of cs:go...

For those who cannot handle "all the time" the pressure and adrenaline related to top fps games like this one, there are a lot of other amazing mods with less pressure but greater fun too... Climbing, Bhop, football, scout, multigames, Zombiez... 

My favorite is the last one, even if surviving isnt that easy, the big danger won't come as you might think from the ennemy , ie: zombiez, but from noob CTs especially the edgers...  The worst thing is that they never learn from their mistakes o.O
So beware, you've been warned !!!

Go Go Go

^_^

Update 26.11.2018: Sadly most players have migrated to CSGO. Still have a community but not as vivid as it was before... To sad since CSS is still the best !!

This game gave me endless fun years ago, spent over 4.5k hours on this game from competitive games to being a criminal in jail_, shooting dressed up mario players in mg_, climbing the Mount Everest in kz_, being a crazy bunny in bhop_ or surfing through the map at surf_

The game with endless possibilities.
The best game in the Counter-Strike* lifetime.

Pros:
- Hit boxes are  awesome they work!
- For an older game it looks good.
- Good old classic no skin, no bullshit.
- Runs on 100 dollar systems.

Cons:
- Price
So, i received this game for free after being fed up with the toxic community of CSGO. And what I played was mind blowing. It felt nothing like CSGO, but somehow better. The guns had a much more powerful and punchier sound to them, making me feel like I was actually shooting a lethal weapon, instead of a peashooter.

Along with that the community has been relatively nice, and all the servers I joined had little to no toxicity.

Anyway, get this game, it's fun.
- Tons of fun custom maps and mods that people actually play
- Ragdoll physics
- Free sprays (which are customizable)
- Not Free2Play
- No loot crates
- No BR mode
A game I owned back in 04, pirated when I got hacked and lost my account, this account is the lasted one I made and it just feels good to buy it and play again. I've played 1.6 and Source a lot when I was younger and I really wish I could put more hours into this, alas the future of Counter Strike is shaping to omething different. However when I wake up at 2 am in the morning without any sleeping. I'll get out of bed, power my pc, put on my headset and open up Counter Strike: Source. Just like when I was younger, and meet new people, play competitively, and love every bit of it. This game... aswell as 1.6 will forever hold a special place in my heart.

I love the game but damn, gotta turn my volume down
Still laughing my a** off every single session! Really, sometimes I die two or three times because of laughing too much about all those funny situations. Have to add that I don't play regular css servers, but i truely recommend everybody to join zombie hunting servers by EliteHunterZ - most funniest css mod I know, awesome maps and thousands of funny situations happening all the time. See all IPs and more at elite-hunterz.info! And the best is: Two full servers, both offering 64 slots.

6600+ hours in game, probably 6500 hours on zm servers - there was so much to learn: bunnyhopping, knifing, surfing and simple and advanced tactics for hunterz and camperz. 

Playing the game almost every day since 2010 and to me there is no end in sight...
I like playing this game.
It's fun as hell.


But you know whats more fun than actually playing?

Spamming "COVER ME" and "GET OUTTA THERE ITS GONNA BLOWWWW" over and over again.

its a pretty good meme if you ask me
GOOD product.  I've only played it a little™, but it's very fun.

Make sure to check out the custom game modes (like Zombie Escape, Zombie Mod, Surf, Death Run, etc.). Classic CS is still great, but the custom game modes are where Source really shines.

This game is so good, i play this game for casual, this game has a good graphic, and there is no toxic community in the game ,You can play multiplayer in it, and also Single player, there is no story on this game, But its a good game for playing with a friend, this game also just need a minimum requirement,Good to play with friend who have a bad PC 
10/10
No one can argues this is what MULTIPLAYER gaming is all about. This is the holyland of FPS. YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH THIS PURCHASE IF YOU HAVENT HEARD OF THIS FRANCHISE YOUVE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK.
Ahh CS:Source.One of my personal faves ever since I was a child.First time I played it was around 2005 but didn't like it that much mostly because everyone was still playing 1.6.Which was at that time at least in my country, at the peak of its glory.Neverless all of that, this game still holds a special place in my heart.Playing many surf maps,zombie maps,deathruns with friends and many more.The body physics were the biggest attraction to CS:S for me.Source's graphics at that time were insane and people were surprised with it.Compared to CS:GO today it's very underrated but what can you do,people change through the years and so does their taste.As I said Source holds a very special place because of many memories I have of it.It already has enough reviews but this one is written purely for respect for this game.Thanks for the memories Valve.
Final verdict 10/10 - Extremely recommended
It's better than CS:GO, but nobody plays it competitively. Also CS:GO is cheaper, But CS:S has a slightly less cancerous community. So you decide, I'd just buy them all in a bundle.
Where to begin? 
Well, hows about we just agree that this is -- by far -- the most fun multiplayer fps ever made? I think that's fair.
Going over in my mind what I absolutely love about it, I almost always think of bullet physics first. Weapons feel like they're being fired. The recoil makes it feel like there's a punch behind (almost) every bullet that hits, and, while the game's age is certainly showing, the freedom it gives the experienced player is in my humblest of opinions unrivalled.
The fast pacing, the short rounds, the sheer amount of game modes and ways of playing the same game makes it thoroughly enjoyable. Not something that I'd recommend playing 10 hours a day, because that would make even a hardcore gamer stupid(er), but for a quick fix before leaving for work or something similar, this game is absolutely perfect.
I grew up with the great games of the 90's like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D (and 2D), etc, but it wasn't until I started playing the first Counter-Strike that I felt like the mouse and keyboard was a(n almost) natural extension of my physical body in the virtual world. I've played around 3000 hours of Source as of this writing, and I felt like it was about time I made public my thoughts on the game.
I strongly recommend getting this game, if only to take personal notes and experience a bit of gaming history.
joined game
got a cross map no scope with awp

went to google to translate

10/10 would awp russians again
Counter-Strike: Source is one of those classic games that don't go away that easily. This game is like the CLIMAX of the CS series since CS 1.4. I bet that most people knew about Counter-Strike because of this game. This game is well-polished, it did have bugs and glitches back then but it's gone after several updates. Even playing with just bots is fun to play (especially putting them on the highest difficulty. Aimbot and all).

I still remember those early times of CS:S where you can't choose a "soldier/mercenary" to use, like just getting into the game with the same "outfit", which is the Phoenix and I think the ST6 (if I'm not mistaken). Also, this game had a shield once. It was fun to use but it was removed from the game.

Well, this game might last for decades, I hope. Overall, it's a GREAT game. I can't even like make a minimalistic or a wide review for this game since it's just that good and memorable. Definitely will be played for years.

NOTE: Yes, currently I have few hours of this game but I actually played the "cracked/pirated" version of it when I was 7, so if I add up all the hours back then and sum it all up with my current hours. I probably have a thousand hours (or almost) of game time (including offline times).

If I have wrong grammars and comprehensions or any reactions, feel free to comment on my review. Thanks for reading.
Do you hate those black and purple checkered textures in Garry's Mod?

Do you like playing older shooters?

Do you like angry Russians?

If you answered yes to any or all of those questions than this is the game for you!
I've spent a lot of time in that game a long, long time ago... mostly playing deathmatches on custom maps. And I remember it was so great, that once I played it for a month straight and literally could play it in my mind when I closed my eyes. So what happened to it? Why when I try to come back, it feels more aged that 1.6? Why the movement feels clunky and the shooting like I'm not shooting at all? I guess I'm not as hardcore anymore, or maybe there was no better alternative at the time...  I'll still give it the thumbs up, for all the good times we spent together, but I just can't play it anymore.
Although the game was released back in 2004 and most of the competitive side has moved to the newer CS:GO, the unlimited amount of mods in this game guarantee you tons of fun. So, if you are looking for a great FPS to have fun on with friends, then this game is a must have.
I spent countless hours in this game back in the day which is just not possible in csgo, that game is just a big pile of horseshit.
this is without a doubt the best version of cs,

-A non rediculous community
-good competitive modes
-standard modes are still playable and active
-has decent community maps
Yeah this game is good definitely worth getting
I love CSS after long time of playing i just had to post here a review
CSS stands for Counter Strike Source (everyone knows), a Official Port/remake of Counter strike 1.6´s Goldsrc engine to Source. As the First Game on Source engine. The Counter Strike Source impressed me for its time With it´s features of support for DirectX 9 with lower down to DirectX 7 for slower Graphics Cards. This ensures you would get best Graphics at the time. CSS uses also updated Steam version , meaning it´s alot harder to crack/pirate the game. The community is also nice i don´t hear anyone screaming in the microphone like some singer. 8X MSAA Antialiasing makes textures look less blurry and helps you alot. The community has also zero tolerance against cheaters ,Meaning you will most likely found every server VAC Secured with additional Anti-Cheat like SourceMod Anti Cheat (not sponsored by). The game also takes it´s core fun games from its predecessors like Bunnyhopping with custom modded stuff, Surf and Zombie Escape/survival.
For 10 euros i  can´t complain and i can say only:
Get this game, Play this Game ,Enjoy this game.
Counter-Strike: Source combines the award-winning original team shooter Counter-Strike 1.6 technologies engine Orange box. Counter-Strike: Source has updated graphics, realistic physics and a completely revamped sound, weapons, player models (which at the time in 2004), all of this and more awaits you in the game from the company Valve. Counter-Strike: Source simply must take a prominent place in the collection of every fan of the genre "Action".

So here is my "first review"

Cs source was published by Valve around 2004 and is the sucessor of the cs conditional zero. Offering  a brand new source engine (2004 source engine, not a bit new, more than 10 years), better graphics, better physics and brand new steam  achievements.

Gamemodes is still the same on previous cs series, like hostage rescue and some casual, plus there is custom gamemodes created by community if someone is interested like deathmatch, AWP matches, Zombie Escape, jailbreak and MORE!

[H1]Pros[/h1]
Community still active, not much, around 3k people, but still alive
Graphics are decent tho, even from source engine
Physics are decent. A bit weird, but fun
There is tons of weapon mods on gamebanana in case you want to test, like csgo skins, but for cs source, some cod weapons.
Fancy steam achievements

[H1]Neutral[/h1]
Some people buys this game for gmod textures, but meh.. its their decision

[H1]Cons[/h1]
Nothing to say.

[H1]Mark: [/h1]10/10.

M8, this game is so addicting, get the fucking game right now, what are you waiting for? Go get some frags
A timeless Classic! Still my favourite game on steam and was my first out of the many more I got.
It's a damn shame that the aussie jailbreak servers are gone but back 5-6 years ago they where everywhere!
Still recommend this game for starters on steam like I was when I first started steam :).
10/10
Oof
Vanilla's ok, but you can get thousands of hours out of the modded/community game-modes (Zombie Escape, Gun Game, Jailbreak etc). Unlike in CSGO, in CSS you only play on private community servers; not only are these better moderated than CSGO (hackers/trolls are banned swiftly by the admins) you actually make friends and have a much better and more social time on CSS. It's much more fun being autistic on Zombie Escape with your friends than raging because of hackers on CSGO competitive.
I've spent a lot of time in that game a long, long time ago... 
It's fun, more fun, than CS:GO. Better behave community. More mods (surf, deathrun, ... ) than in CS:GO. 
You'll find everything between deathmatch and volleyball! Bunnyhopping and climbing. You can enter role play gamemodes like Jail or fight masses of zombies... 
What can I say: It's freak'n old. It's not a beauty today. 
BUT it's working AND there are still players out there AND it's representing a really good era of online gaming.
It's the game i grew up with, kept me happy when i was feeling down~

it's been 15 years since it got released and honestly it never gets old, there's still a ton of servers and active players while the rest moved on to global offensive so you can expect quite a lot of difference in cheating scene.

Physics used to be far more better than what it currently is but hey they always change for better or worse after some time and this game is no exception, bhopping is still easy nonetheless and i would totally recommend this game if you're a movement player, tough start but smooth progress when you get the hang of it ^^;
Overshadowed by CSGO and CS 1.6, Source up to this day is one of the most enjoyable Multiplayer videogames out there. The community may be small or dying (If you're one of those that uses that cliche word) but is passionate, you can feel the love that a lot of people put into this game with all the "Alternative" gamemodes, maps and skins. 

Oh, and did I mention the bots? Not only does the game have official bot support, but this bots also have a lot of dialogs that make them feel a little more human.
Came here from GO, initially just for ZE, stayed for great movement, community, and overall very enjoyable experience. I have since fallen in love with css and would rather play it than go. Also check out gfl’s ze server

This is my favourite game. Not only are the mechanics nearly perfect to my standards, but its SO much fun to play with friends. You're able to get custom skins and maps through gamebanana, and you can make the game really fun for yourself if you find it gets boring. Dont trap yourself and only play deathmatch. Try doing pugs, surf, surf deathmatch, bhopping, jailbreak, and more.
yes many games play of this strike source counter
good pews
good bhop
good deagle

csgo can never compete
(am counter-strike boy for 1.5 decades (15 years))

[h1] Let's see, where do I even begin?!?[/h1] 
This is an absolutely beautiful game that came into my life right as I was going into middle school. 
My buddies and I used to play for hours on end, running endless skirmishes against each other on a LAN server we set up on an old Compaq Tower. Some days it was all that we had to look forward to... The lack of any true responsibilities let us dedicate excessive amounts of time (especially during the winter months) to playing CSS. Once I moved out of state, this gem box full of memories would be closed and tucked away for years. It's been quite a trip back through memory lane, playing on the maps I memorized as a teenager.

The game in and of itself is masterfully designed and executed, this is the game that defined the Counter Strike series as one of the greatest in the history of e-sports and First Person Shooters as a genre.

Back before skin's defined prestige, this is raw, unfiltered Counter-Strike.

[quote=Unknown] DOOR'S STUCK! THE DOOR IS STUCK! [/quote]
This used to be THE go-to game to buy if you were into FPS games around 2005, but now it just serves as a source of content for Garry's Mod. It's still worth buying if you want GMod to not have missing content. Infact, by this point, it's a must.
I decide to buy it mainly because it was 2 euros during the Winter Sale.
But I am really impressed of the fact that this game still has quite a big community.
I recommend it, a pretty good trip down memory lane.
Take me back to 2004 please... Damn do I miss the days where I would go to some friend's house and play CS source at our Lan parties. Damn do I feel old too now this game holds a lot of good memories to me but I cannot believe the game is this old by now... just makes me feel older. Anyway game is still nice if you have not played it yet I would recommend it on a sale especially if you never got the chance to play Source.
Old Faithful.
The new ones look better, but that wears off quick in the sun. The older ones left some good memories, but they've gotten loose. Only CS: Source with it's healthy modding scene that peaked in the heights of the Source Engine age kept it's tightness and puts out on a dime to this day.
The game is really good, I,be just started playing about a month about and the game is the best only downside is that everyone is better than you bc its been out for like 9 years
CAREFUL: FRAUD
==============
The offered "Counter-Strike Complete" Bundle does NOT include the most recent game of this series "Counter Strike: Global Offensive". The naming is very misleading!

I reported this game.
