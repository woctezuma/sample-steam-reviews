[h1][u] General Impression [/u][/h1]
Bioshock Infinite was originally going to be more of an open world game with a variety of features but with disagreements in development accompanied with the limitations the product was facing on other platforms, they decided to scrap most of what they were working on to create the version you see before you. The product Irrational Games showcased at E3 2010 is significantly different compared to the product that's available to the consumer.

Not every game has to have more than one ending, stealth mechanics, weapon customization, a third person player view, character customization, a variety of meaningful choices, manual save mechanics, modification development tools or have no scripted moments to be a decent game. Sure, any one of these features would have been great additions and dispite of the downgrade, I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite if the price is right.
This game was absolutely amazing.  Even a year after playing it all the way through, some aspects of the underlying story still stick with me.  I won't speak much to gameplay, because while I enjoyed the game immensely that wasn't what made this a true experience.  All of the BioShock games were excellent and a great journey - certainly at the top of my list for enjoyment.  Infinite was a little different though.  For me, it was the visually impactful segments and the deeply moving moments throughout.  Everyone connects with storytelling differently, but this one resonated with me a great deal.  For reference, my beloved list of games like this one are F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate and 2, Dead Space 3, Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age II, Syberia I and II, The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Half Life 2, Unreal II and a handful more.  This game was at the upper end of that list and I wish I could have stayed in the Infinite world for so much longer.  The ending for me was like the ending of the Hyperion/Endymion novel series - I understood it and knew at a visceral level that it was coming, but it took me a while to accept it because I was so invested in the main characters and I didn't want them to go.  It is so rare for a story to sit inside me casting around for a place to rest amongst my values and character.  In 40 years, I have experienced this with a very small collection of books, movies and games.  BioShock Infinite managed to find a place there.
No game will ever affect me as much as BioShock Infinite did.

After playing through the game three times (twice on Xbox 360 & once on PC) it still upsets me that Irrational signed over the series permanently.

I'm going to keep this clean of any spoilers and say that this was a brilliant end to the revolution of the trilogy, and that Burial at Sea episodes One & Two are to be considered absolutely mandatory if you are to play this game properly.

This game has been one of only a few games, that has brought me to tears on more than one occasion. Call me a cry baby or whatever, but I am as passionate about this series as any fanatic is about whatever they are obsessed with.

BioShock will always have a special place in my life post of completing Infinite.

I would recommend not only this game, but BioShock, BioShock 2 also.
If you are thinking about buying this, do it, have fun, and pay attention.
Step 1: Finish Game.
Step 2: Stay speechless for a while.
Step 3: Find a wizard.
Step 4: Tell wizard to erase memory of game in head.
Step 5: Repeat Cycle.

It's one of those games that once you finish it, it's too hard to repeat. Too bad there are no wizards and I can't unseen this game. Crazy great plot and gameplay. 10/10 would do Elizabeth...er...the game again.
1. Extraordinary plot
2. Remarkable graphics
3. Great combat experiences, and
4. Elizabeth

I thoroughly enjoyed every minute in this game and strongly recommend trying it. 10/10

Like the first game, Bioshock Infinite is a very thematically ambitious game. One that begins to elevate storytelling in gaming. There will surely be a lot of discussion to follow with this one. There's a lot of care taken with the world in which it takes place in, as well as with some of the themes it handles. And Bioshock Infinite opts to hold very little back. Here you'll be tackling themes such as racism, religion, false prophets, gender roles, even moments that will test your own morals. It's got a lot to say. The story and the world also come to life in the same way that Rapture does. While Columbia is not as dazzling as the trip into the underwater world, it does have a pulse just the same. You'll find Voxphones scattered throughout. These, like the original Bioshocks audio diaries, add a lot more to the tale at hand. They add to the story, the world and the atmosphere. To ignore them is to miss out on a considerable portion of the game. For those very curious about the world they're playing in, they will most certainly want to pick these up.

The world of Columbia is wider and more open than the claustrophobic and enclosed Rapture, gun fights involve more enemies than the original Bioshock. The problem with this is that it devalues the fights itself. In the original Bioshock, enemies were something to fear. Even the most basic ones could do damage to you if you're not prepared. In Infinite, most enemies are just faceless guards who you just simply have to shoot in order to progress to other parts of the story. Most fights just end up repetitive, and though the game allows you to use various methods such as vigors and skyhooks to defeat enemies, rarely do you ever need to. Most of the game you're grossly overpowered, even if you're not upgrading your vigors or weapons.

Another thing, though admittedly it's a nitpick, the dissonance between the beautiful story and the violent shooting is something worth mentioning. Sometimes the dialogue and the "breather" scenes seem to be slightly disrupted by the high amounts of adrenaline shooting that follows. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but it's certainly something that could be done better. Less emphasis on gunplay and maybe some more exploration elements could benefit this game.

Bioshock Infinite isn't a perfect game, but it is a great one. A thematically ambitious game with a well told story, Bioshock Infinite is sure to delight fans who fell in love with the original back in 2007. It is a game that not only delivers well from a gameplay standpoint, but from a narrative one as well. If you enjoyed exploring the world of Rapture in 2007, then you'll love going through the land of Columbia, here.
One of the best games of 2013! [spoiler] Despite this late review [/spoiler]

+ Storyline is amazing
+ The artwork is beyond amazing
+ It is almost like a movie instead of a game
+ The Sky Line is hella fun and useful in combat situations
+ Many different places to explore
+ Elizabeth

This is how you make an awesome FPS game.
play as the roguish Booker "Danno" DeWitt in this post-modern tour-de-force that explores concepts such as combat rollercoaster, haircut effect, gundam president, and more. your companion, Elsa, teaches you about life, love, and that girls just wanna have fun.

Absolutely magnificent.  Has newly taken the title for my favourite game of all time.  Less horror-ish and more story focused than the other 2 titles in the series.  If you're even considering getting it, stop.  Just get it.  There isn't a chance in hell you'll regret it.
I don't think I've ever fancied a video game character before Elizabeth... Whilst my hours on steam don't reflect my actual playing time, as I've completed this game way too many times on my PS3, I just can't express how much I love this. It's my favourite ever game, and here's why:

1) [b]The plot is incredible, and has real substance.[/b] I've never completed a game more than once before, because I find playing the same story line tiring. However, this is an exception. The story line is phenomenal. I find myself being totally, and utterly, immersed in the world of Columbia. I have a real sense of "belonging" within the game which sounds a bit weird, but I don't really know how I can explain it. Brooker DeWitt and Elizabeth are both very strong characters, with great backstories, and the way these stories collide with each other is thought provoking, fantastically executed and cleverly directed.

2) [b]The graphics are visually stunning.[/b] The joy of playing this game with ultra settings, is one to be behold. If you're looking for a game with a wealth of detail, this is the one. Characters and scenery look great in the cut scenes and during game play. The lighting is just right throughout, and to me, fire has never before looked so good.

3) [b]The characters are strong, witty, and badass.[/b] And whoever voiced the characters need a medal, because I couldn't imagine anyone else stepping up to deliver what these guys have delivered. 

4) [b] Combat. Is. Awesome.[/b] I never really liked gore in a game before, but I really enjoyed this, with just the right amount of gore included. Not just that, it's really easy to pick up which I love, and seem to have trouble with in other games.

The only real criticism I can think of is the lack of DLC's available, and wishing that the story went on just that little bit longer. I didn't want it to end. Other than that, I really can't fault it. You're not just buying a game here, you're literally buying an entire world. Three hundred thumbs up from me!
Bioshock Infinite left me with a hole in my heart. You know that feeling, at the end of a great book or movie or TV show or whatever, and for a moment you wonder "wait, is it really over?" And then you try to convince yourself that it's not, and you try to find any way at all to fill that sudden void. I don't know, maybe that feeling's new to you. Play Bioshock Infinite to feel it, I guess.

Rewind. I had heard of Bioshock, knew it was some kind of x-punk techno-fantasy kind of world known for rich story and character development. I never picked it up though because, well, sometimes the time just never feels right to pick something up. I started with Infinite off a whim. The first ten minutes took my breath away. And I spent the next several hours trying to get it back and failing, all the way until the credits rolled their way across the screen.

The music is beautiful. The scenery is beautiful. The dialogue is beautiful. There's a bonding between the setting and the plot that I can't fully explain. I guess this is what people mean by "immersion." Turns out you don't need some avatar you create to be fully immersed, no, all you need are characters you empathize with, who grip you by your mind, your heart, your soul, who rocket into your life from a different world and fade away just as abruptly.

Interlude: the gameplay is technically well-done. I'm not one for FPSs generally, I mean, I'll play one but I'm not very GOOD at it. I wasn't very good at this game either but if Bioshock Infinite does one thing well gameplay-wise, it's offering the player choices. Do you want to run into every encounter guns-blazing? Do you want to stay back and judiciously use spells (ahem, vigors) to crowd control? Do you want to swing around a giant skyline raining bullets from on high before flipping down and sticking the landing with a spinning gear-shiv to the face? Mix and match to your heart's desire. Bioshock Infinite is a series of FPS set pieces with several options per encounter, although I'd say that once you find your groove, it's pretty easy to lock yourself into one way of doing things. Aside from combat, there's a minor exploration component, and this is where the game struggles just a little maintaining its shimmering veneer of immersive world-building. If all you had to do was walk around and explore the beautiful world the creators made for you, that would've been perfect, but for whatever reason the developers insisted on sticking in "collectible bonuses" in little nooks and crannies out of the way of the main plot to reward people for wandering like an aimless lunatic and digging through trash cans. Well, nothing's perfect.

The thing is, this game would be worth playing if it didn't have any gameplay at all. I'm serious. Just experiencing it completely passively would have been enough to make me feel similarly to how I feel now. But there's a certain extra factor gained by the interactivity afforded to the player. The stakes feel real. And Elizabeth, one of my favorite "companion" characters in a long time, by a long margin, feels like a real friend who you want to protect. Like someone with whom to laugh, to live, to cherish every passing moment because you know, one moment, it'll all be over, but God only knows what you'd do without her.

Look, all of this was just to lend some substance to the review so that it'd make sense to you, who has never played the game. But in the end Bioshock Infinite left me with a hole in my heart, and that's what I really felt was worth saying.
[b]Note: Play the games in this order

Bioshock 1 > Bioshock 2 > Bioshock Infinite[/b]

The year is 1912 and you play as Booker DeWitt and you've been tasked with saving  a girl, Elizabeth , in the city of Columbia. 

The game is an Action FPS that is true to its genre. The game offers a fairly fast paced action that might sometimes feel a bit tedious. Bioshock Infinite contains a multitude of weapons that are era specific and are lovely to use.

You also have access to powers, known as vigors, which you can use to dispose of enemies or to just help you make your way through the game. The vigors can also be combined with each other making it an intriguing system to play around with.

In addition to Weapons and Vigors you have other tools, like the skyhook, which lets you jump around from hooks attached to the side off certain buildings.

The stealth system within the game is good. The detection is based around both sound and vision so walking on a carpet can suppress your footsteps while walking on puddles of water or broken glass will make them louder.

The games scenery and enviroments are absolutely outstanding. When I got the first glimpse of Columbia I was speechless. 

The voice acting in the game is great as well with excellent dialogue. I'm quite serious now, I can't describe how PERFECT some parts were with how the characters acted and what they said. This game has brought forward some amazing quotes. In addition to that, all of the characters are well made and very sympathetic. 

I like games that have a good story, and Bioshock Infinite has just that. The story  is incredibly rich when it comes to content and will leave you with memorable parts that will make you smile when you think back.

Bioshock Infinite is a game that you will not regret playing. It's fantastic.

edit - removed Chrono order to please people.
It was one of those games which you wish they won't end,but still want to finish it in order to understand the meaning of the whole story (mostly the ending) and then regret finishing it because good things end.
Having played the main story on the hardest setting and completed all the DLCs I have to say: I absolutely love BioShock Infinite. 

[h1]Positive:[/h1]
- Extremely beautiful and atmospheric settings - as to be expected of a BioShock game
- Fantastic, intense and unexpected storyline
- DLCs actually deliver new and exciting storylines and game play
- Great voice-acting and music overall
- Responsive controls
- I enjoyed only being able to hold two weapons at a time (unlike the other two BioShock games). It allows you to adjust to the situation by providing different weapons for you to pick up, or stick to your preferred play-style without scrolling through a huge inventory of weapons
- No escorting: Elizabeth takes care of herself and helps you from time to time
- You are rewarded for exploring
- Challenging battles that remain exciting throughout the game

[h1]Negative:[/h1]
- I always found it strange that you take fall damage, but not when jumping off the sky line
- Personally I found the crows + shock jockey combo to be extremely over-powered 
- The main story is only approximately 10 hours long
- Less exploration than BioShock 1 and 2
- Quite linear 

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
If you like BioShock then Infinite is a must - it delivers what you would expect plus more. Fantastic game-play, intensely atmospheric environments, unforgetable story, and DLCs that connect Infinite to the original BioShock games (it will [b]blow[/b] your mind). This is the only game I have ever pre-ordered and I do not regret it at all.

Although it's a simplistic, heavily scripted, linear experience, it's one of the most optimized, visually appealing, interesting ones available. It's been a while since a game compelled me to write a review and [i]if the price is right[/i], I can absolutely recommend Bioshock Infinite.

[h1][b][u]Unique aspects of Bioshock worth noting[/u][/b][/h1]

[b]Elizabeth's Pathfinding, Awareness & Helpfulness.[/b] In [i]years prior[/i] many companions in games would get you caught, waste all of your ammo, die, or block you from progressing all while being totally silent. Elizabeth will toss you ammunition or money should she find any, will move out of your way if you walk close to her and will constantly make remarks about her surroundings.

[b]The use of the Sky Hook and Skylines.[/b] Sure, conventional methods of transportation are just fine and dandy but it certainly never hurts to think outside the box! It's quite an enjoyable experience zipping throughout Columbia on the Skylines while fighting enemies.

[h1][b][u]Aspects of Bioshock Infinite worth praising[/u][/b][/h1]

● [b]No [i]Third Party[/i] Digital Rights Management.[/b] No limited amount of machine activations, no "always online" requirements, and no services other than Steam you need to sign into to play.

● [b]The Achievement Progress Saving System.[/b] You can reload checkpoints to accumulate kills and loot containers. And if you were to ever miss any Voxophones, Telescopes or Kinetoscopes,  you can simply go to "Load Chapter" and select the chapter you believe you missed it on and collect it. However, you have to be weary about Infusions as they have to be obtained in a consecutive playthrough.

[h1][b][u]Aspects of Bioshock Infinite worth criticizing[/u][/b][/h1]

● [b]No In-Game Option To Toggle HUD or Holster Weapon![/b] This is an unfortunate trend in many 2K Games and 2K Games affiliate products going back years. Honestly, what's the point in developing such beautiful scenery if you're not going to have the ability to take screenshots of it without a Health bar, Shield bar, Vigor bar, your arm and your gun getting in the way?

● [b]2 Weapon Limitation.[/b] In previous Bioshock titles you had access to a wide range of different weapons via a weapon wheel. This time around it's limited to just two weapons.

● [b]Lackluster amount of choices or alternative endings.[/b] [spoiler]For a game that's circled around infinite parallel universes with infinite possibilities, why does Bioshock Infinite have such a lackluster amount of meaningful choices or any sort of alternate ending? It's debatable if Bioshock Infinite really needed any but I certainly wouldn't want to be the individual aruguing for less.[/spoiler]

[h1][b][u]Development disagreements & degradation of the product![/u][/b][/h1]

Bioshock Infinite was originally going to be more of an open world game with a variety of features but with disagreements in development accompanied with the limitations the product was facing on other platforms, they decided to scrap most of what they were working on to create the version you see before you.

[h1] BIOSHOCK INFINITE REVIEW [/h1]

I'm not even sure where to start a review on this game. I've played countless amount of games in my lifetime, some that have given me very fond, happy memories. Some have given me grief, or regret, and some have made me feel... Sad, Attached.. Inspired. This is one of those few games that have made me feel this way.

I can honestly say that I fell in love with this game from the first part. I won't spoil it but, the first area after the lighthouse? Oh it's beautiful. I think I just stood there and walked around listening to that song, looking at the scenery as it played. I got really attached at that point. 

The story, to me, is like.. when you want to play a game and you want it to have a really good story, and something that makes sense and seems worth your time. That's definitely this story. I could go on and on about how fantastic this game is, but I think if you're on the edge of purchasing it, then definitely do so. It could honestly change your life. I know it has for me. 

It seems a bit silly, as this is just a game to some, but I believe that games are a form of artwork, and with artwork, you can produce certain feelings and messages to give to the receivers. 

This is my favorite game of all time, and it will always be forever now. It holds a very special place in my heart... I'll never forget it.

Story: 11/10 (Seriously, it's breathtaking)

Graphics: 10/10 (I'm a sucker for the art-style, heh)

Audio: 8/10 (Sometimes, very very very rarely the audio would mess up and sound like it was underwater or something. 
Pretty sure that's on my end though, as it happened with another game too)

Gameplay: 8/10 (The combat is quite fun, it's very different from what you may be used to, it's like.. crisp. If that makes sense.)

[h1] Wholeheartedly recommend this game. :) [/h1]


It starts off well, then it gets really weird, then it becomes really dark, then there's a lot of shooting and then you get mind fucked. Worth every penny.

10/10.
Pros
+Booker our hero actually has a personality/character and he is likeable enough to keep you going.
+Elizabeth your companion 70% of the people who bought Bioshock Infinite did it just for her.
+The atmosphere is excellent imagine a mixture of the dark setting that Bioshock had with a unique colorful vibrant twist.
+The story adds humor/drama and its one of the best youre gonna find in an action game.
+Voice acting is superb and goes well with the storytelling.
+Many key elements from the original Bioshock games come back,both in the main game and in the DLC.

Cons
-No save system you have to rely on checkpoints.
-Gameplay is pretty basic but enjoyable.
-You have to purchase DLC in order to get the whole experience.

Final Verdict
While the game might be a bit overhyped its a unique enjoyable experience and well worth the money 9/10
Whoever says games can't be considered "Art" probably never played any BioShock game.

BioShock Infinite brings entertainment to another level, I haven't had fun with a game for a long time. That doesn't mean all the others releases are bad but it's been a while since i had so much fun playing a game.

The plot it's one of the best i've seen in my entire gaming life, matching some Visual Novels and books i love (i kinda like a good plot and not the usual mindless action or generic shooting gallery we get most of the time). I don't think you'll find another game with a better quality plot anytime soon.

Graphics aren't realistic but that doesn't mean they are bad, they got kinda a unique style that makes everything beautiful. You could say they are the same as the older games but they certainly improved a lot. However i kinda get annoyed with the excessive "bloom" in some scenes, sometimes they are overused to the point of blinding you. Aside from that everything else is beautiful. 

There's the music, honestly it isn't great but it's not bad either, the combat music is the same for the whole game save some specific scenes and it gets repetitive after a while. It's average at best.

The gameplay is what you've already seen in BioShock 1 & 2 with some improvements. You can equip gears that gives you a few improvements like auto-casting lightning when you are struck or put your enemies on fire when you strike them with melee attacks.

There's the new "Sky-Line" mechanic that allows you to travel around the place and can even be used in your advantage during combat, your partner Elizabeth even rides with you.

And talking about Elizabeth, that's one hell of a companion. She is like Alyx in Half-Life 2: Episode One but instead of fighting she gives you support during and outside combat like finding and giving you ammo, salt, money and even warning about points of interest and some missable items like lockpicks. I love when i'm almost out of ammo and she throws me some ammo, she also plays a huge role in the plot.

Honestly i haven't cared about my companion in a single-player game since Alyx, she isn't useless like most companions who doesn't do jack aside from yelling at you all the time like 'AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS", " TAKE POINT", "THEY ARE KILLING US DO SOMETHING!!!". 

PC port is above average, there isn't much graphics options but at least the game runs great, without vsync the game always run above 60fps (sometimes going up to 90fps) with everything maxed out and the game has some pretty graphics.

It took me around 13 hours to beat the game.

My rate: 9,5

At first I bought the game for its style, how it looks and I was amazed by the results when playing. The graphics are absolutely amazing. Then I discovered that the story is interesting too! I'm in love with this game.

Recently finished the first Bioshock and wanted to give this a try. I absolutely loved playing this game. It was so fun I found it much more enjoyable to play through than the first one (and not just because it's newer) though I did miss Andrew Ryan. 

I loved the story, more than I did the original Bioshock 1 story, and story is not something I typically buy an FPS for. The world is not as immersive as the original as it's not underwater and the environment is less creepy, but it is beautiful and the soundtrack and characters easily do the series justice. 

Do yourself a favour and play the game. 

Side note - this game is way easier than the first Bioshock. I played on the "medium" default setting, so if you like a challenge, go for hard.
OH MY GOD.
The game sure did not get 94/100 from Metacritic for no proper reason.

It's full of things to do, Main quest, Lots of side missions, Things to collect like weapon upgrades, Skill upgrades and Passive abilities, and of course, Easter Eggs to look for.

The scenery you see in game is just amazing. Totally mind-blowing if you ask from me. It ranges from Rainy Seashore to up the skies in the Floating City, and all the way down to deep bottom of the Ocean. And the best part, you don't need very powerful computer for this game to funtion properly. I played with the 2nd lowest graphics, had my fps constant, and still was stunned by the beautiful views. 

Apart from landscape, the gameplay part is absolutely well-made.
The gameplay contains mainly shooting and puzzles.

The weapon models look really nice, and there are no bugs at all with animations.
Some of the guns barrels even turn shining red from heat caused by constant shooting.

You can blow your enemies up with RPG, shoot them as full of holes as Swiss Cheese,
Abilities that you can use to turn your enemies into piles of ash, or to skyrocket them million miles away.
Of course you don't need to always kill everyone. The game let's you choose most of the time whether to shoot or to stay in stealthy mode, looking out for threats and staying in shadows.

The characters are easy to identify with.
You just want to sit and keep playing, because the story is so entertaining and addictive.
You want to see what's next, what is behind the next corner, what kind of enemies will you face.

And, to be honest, there are merely no games without any bugs nowadays.
I am talking about visual bugs, possible glitches and getting out of bounds.
The bugs i got never killed me or prevented me to continue my adventure.
For example, sometimes NPCs walked on places where they shouldn't have walked, Like on walls.

But if you're into that kind of stuff, like i am, you're gonna find yourself going to places you were not supposed to go, and trying to find your way inside buildings, or outside areas, where you never was meant to be at.

When i realized the credits were about to roll, i was a bit disappointed about the length of the game.
It took me 14 hours to complete all the side missions, and main quest.

It's not a long game, but it's very enjoyable. There's a lot of replay value too. Personally, that was one of the best Singleplayer shooters i've ever played. Totally recommended.

Thanks for reading, hopefully this helped.

[h1]Must have[/h1]

I don't always finish my games, but when I played Bioshock Infinite, I finished it twice. DLCs included. 

Masterpiece.
All the ingredient of success : fun gameplay, beautiful graphics and world design, incredible story.

Pros :

- Incredible story, with stunning details and love put into the creation of this universe.
- Characters are fabulous, with background story for all of them, if you wish to learn more about the universe.
- Wonderful art and world design. Columbia lives up to Rapture's hype. 
- Elizabeth.
- DLCs in pre-civil war Rapture. Wonderful to see the city alive.
- Gameplay is smooth, and unlike what some comments might have said, combat is nervous. I liked it anyways, and it's an improvement on the previous titles.
- Perfectly suited soundtrack.


Cons :

- You'll never be happy again.
- You'll need to google the ending because you'll be mindf*cked, especially if you are not native english speaker and play the game in english.
- You'll have to explain your soulmate why you want to name your daughter Elizabeth.
[h1] BIOSHOCK INFINITE [/h1]
* Explore Columbia to retrieve a girl and experience surprises beyond your imagination *

~ Elizabeth is a lovely and energetic lady full of mysteries 
~ Dazzling setting, beautiful scenes and rich atmosphere 
~ Complex, fascinating and compelling story narrative 
~ Satisfying combat gameplay mixed with unique powers
~ Feel a kind of excited panic, total pleasure, confusion and sudden twists 
~ DLC's that adds distinctive features and arena mode for more fps action 

" There's always a lighthouse, a man, a city " I adore this game so much..
9.6\10- Kate
It was on an August night that I first finished this game. I remember staring blanky into my monitor for several minutes while the credit titles were scrolling slowly and that last piano note was echoing in my mind. Dude, this game destroyed me, and this is the only game that has done it so far.

12/10, I never thought that it was possible to be so worried about the wellbeing of a fictional character, dammit Liz!
[h1]I nominate Irrational Games' [b]BioShock Infinite[/b] for [b]The “Whoooaaaaaaa, dude!” Award[/b] category in The Steam Awards 2016![/h1]

Well, what can I say? This award category literally screams BioShock and between the first one and Infinite, I'll go with the most mind blown dealt between the two. I remember finishing the game and just sat there thinking, "...What the hell just happened?". I proceed to go online for more clarification about the ending (yes, I didn't really get it at first). 

This game is simply a masterpiece and I hope someday, in the near future, they will announce a new BioShock even cooler and crazier than this one!
+Amazing Storyline (Though confusing)
+Industrial Revolution Atmosphere
+Beautiful graphics
+Nice Voice Acting
+Classic Gunz
+Cool magics and powers
+Awsome soundtrack
+Columbia
+Chatter Twins
+Blood
+Songbird
+Elizabeth Porn

-Minor Bugs
-Mind=Blown
-Got upset by the Ending ( +Got happy after the Credits :) )
I've always found the Bioshock universe interesting and really well done, unfortunately i dont really enjoy horror atmospheric games like Bioshock 1 & 2. This is exactly the reason i choose Bioshock Infinite. Bioshock infinite manages to put down a really good atmosphere just like part 1 and 2, it's kinda like this 1800's overly happy/goodlife style. And except for 1 or 2 horror atmospheric parts i really enjoyed walking through the flying and colorful world of Columbia. The scenery in this game is so amazing and i found myself often just standing still and enjoying the view.

On to something different: The story and it's characters. Both are really interesting and well done. The story keeps itself interesting by introducing new things all game long. And by looting the world you'll find basic things like salt's, ammo, health etc. but also voxophones, these are audiofragments which expand on the story and give you more background information.  Someting i liked alot about Bioshock Infinite was the fact you travel with Elizabeth almost the whole game. It's something different, and although she doesnt really do much other than provide you with supplies and a bit of talking, it's better than traveling alone. However something you might need to do is search online for a explanation of the ending, because it's a really complex ending. There's alot of video's and sites explaining it, so it shouldn't be a problem finding something about it.

Overall Bioshock Infinite is a amazing game, great story, great characters, great mechanics and a wonderfull world to explore. It's definitely a game that will keep you to thinking for a long time after you finished it.
Try Not To Cry if you play Burial at Sea part 2.
Try Not To Cry if you finish the original.
Try Not To Cry if you think about Elizabeth's character.
Try Not To Cry if you love that universe.

Don't you dare playing lower than Hard difficulty.

Get ready for the sorrow-Joy tears.
Don't be fooled by the preety environment and cute faces of NPCs, the story is one hell of an emotional ride and will make you stare the screen with awe and confusion once you're done with the main story, and will make you do the same when you complete the Burial at the Sea Part 2 DLC (Shocked Pikachu face meme here).
I want to write a lot about it but for now, I want to have a moment alone as I just finished the DLC and a lot of things are revolving around my head, joining pieces from the main game, Bioshock 1 and 2 ( no you don't have to know the story of the previous games)...
1. Find Lutece twins.
2. Make them send me to the parallel universe where I decided not to play Bioshock Infinite.
3. Punch that other "me" in the face.
4. Repeat Steps 2-3 until there are no universes left where I ignored this breathtaking masterpiece.
Im gonna start off by saying that I jumped into cold water with this game. I play some fps games and kinda thought that I knew what to expect. The story took me by surprise, I didnt know anything about it and not only is it well written, its story rich. Apart from that ... the graphics. The graphics of this game are beyond wonderful and me saying that I LOVE it would be an understatement. Been sitting hooked on the game since 15 hours and I got 0 regrets. All I can say is, this is one of my favorite games and I highly recommend it. 

Give it a try and you wont regret it. 
10/10 ♥
Well, clearly i made a mistake for ignoring this in these years. I'm not familiar with last parts of Bioshock series. So Bioshock Infinite is my first experience. So i have realized this is the crown jewel of this series in my opinion. Let me share my thoughts about it on some very aspects.

[i]8.5/10.0, An illustrious and distinguished experience - Aaron[/i]
[i]Percentage of Expectancy : 89%[/i]

[h1]Story[/h1]
So far, i would love to say that the story is the key feature of this title. They have taken the story to another level. It's entirely unpredictable and immersive story. Like a story that could make turn at any time. It has been affiliated with heavenly theme with steampunk mechanism which is obvisouly unique. I loved how they affined multiple continues in the story. Could break my mind to figure the core of the story but everything figures at the end. i actually inflicted outstanding focus to know every sequences. Story went through some flashbacks and clamity moments that's what took the story in my mind. Nothing has been rushed or unexplained in this story. Everything was connected to the fullest extent. Even all the dialogues are well written. So it's worked out pretty well so far.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
From my experience, the whole gameplay is arisen on heavenly world and steampunk theme. There are countless collectibles around the map. Most of the collectibles are important for our play and the other collectibles are included for achievements. So genuinely these collectibles keeps you busy throughout your whole experience. Like you can look around and collect multiple substance in every spots if you want. About abilities, main character could gain some deadly and remarkable abilities and those abilities known as Virgos. We can use these virgos to have great advantage in combat. But it requires replenishing content just like your health. Then comes our iconic companion, Elizabeth who helps me with Ammo, Health Kit, Virgos replenishing Salt whenever you come at shortage. Also Silver Eagle which means in game currency. So she completes an invaluable preamble in your whole experience. About combat, it's way too enjoyable and mind freaking. Also quite challenging at very stages. Some hostiles are kind of complex to eliminate like Fireman, Handyman and Patriot. That's why i loved to play it again and again. Mostly because it has put me in different situations so it was truly amazing to play.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
As this title was created 4 years ago so i'm quite satisfied with the visuals. You can't expect it to have spanking mechanism but you'll love it. They have put some cool facial details on every characters though. So initially, this is a great looking title for that age.

[h1]Utility and Performance[/h1]
Just found some creepy bugs around but no errors, crashes or anything else. Those bugs were too annoying for me though. But i was cool with them.About performance, i got solid 60 FPS with ultra presets on Intel Core i7 7700K, R9 390 STRIX and 6GB Ram. So this is completely auspicious.

[h1]Favorite Feature[/h1]
I can replay any chapters of this story with any difficulty. That's what i want in every game. So this is my favorite feature.

So guys, i'm humbly recommending you this title. Find an excuse and let Bioshock Infinite off the chain. Also I personally guarantee you that you won't be disappointed about this.
[h1]Bring Us the Girl, and Wipe Away the Debt[/h1]

BioShock Infinite is the best game I've ever played and one of the best video games ever made.
You have to play this masterpiece before you die.

TL;DR 10/10 game
The best game I have played in my entire life.

Ok where do we start it...

Shooting and Vigor systems are awesome.
At the beginning looks like a Pixar cartoon, but after a while it goes a bit darker.
Good characters, good plot. Little hints here and there can come out very and very big afterwards.
Game is beautiful, whether it's a sunny day or night in a burning city.
Works good with no lags, even on low graphics it still looks well.

Out of all 3 Bioshock games this one is the prettiest.
Almost all stories about alternative realities and time travel defy logic. Infinite is a typical example of this, but if we ignore that, the game offers an exciting adventure where the main focus is on chemistry between Booker and Elizabeth. In the beginning, gameplay seemed kind of limited, but when I got familiar with more advanced use of skills through completing the Blue Ribbon Challenges it became very fun to build crazy things in the battles.

4/5
Having not played any of the prior versions of Bioshock I had no idea what the franchise was about or what to expect. I was disappointed at first because I was expecting the game to be more of an action / fps rather than an action adventure, and there is about two hours of "story" before any action happens. However I stuck with it and ended up really enjoying it. The visuals in this game are amazing alone, and masterfully done. 


There are some minor thing I would recommend users tweak that I found helped considerably.

**The Good**

* Amazing Visuals.
* Deep and interesting story line
* Good replay value, there is a lot to explore and search through out the BioShock infinite world.

**Needs Improvment**

* Visibility of enemies is very poor, I recommend either using SweetFX or turning up digital vibrance.
* Player movments are very "blocky" with the stock configuration, I found out this was caused by "autoaim" being forced on. There is a config tweak to modify this:

[b]Browse to C:\Users\YOURUSERACCOUNTNAME\Documents\My Games\BioShock Infinite\XGame\Config
Open XUserOptions.ini with notepad or wordpad
Find the line called "bAimAssist=True" and change it to "bAimAssist=False	 [/b]


**Overall Rating **
9.5 / 10
In the public eye, video games have a negative connotation -- they are seen as a waste of time, violent and meaningless.

If there was ever an example of how wrong that statement is, Bioshock Infinite would be that example.

From its gorgeous environments to its beautiful narrative into the depths of human nature, every nook and cranny is crafted with care and is as if effortlessly woven into the fabric of the story. Detail upon detail exists of world Booker is quite literally launched into and a narrative that is as much endearing as thought-provoking.

To put it simply, BioShock Infinite is art.
Hoo boy, I'm late! I'm not too late to write a review for this am I? Nah, let's get started! First here's a short GOODS and NOT-SO-GOODS list to give you a basic idea of all the pro's and cons of the game. If you're looking for a more in-depth review you can scroll to the bottom.

GOODS:
+ Plot. It gets more complex and intruiging as the story goes on but it never feels TOO overwhelming. The pacing and the "show don't tell" approach make it a fantastic experience.
+ Setting. The world of Columbia is amazingly stylized and if you can suspend your disbelief a little it becomes surprisingly immersive. The game also looks beautiful as I'm sure you can tell.
+ Writing. There's a lot of character in the main cast, but even background characters have well-recorded lines that add more depth to the world you're in. Dialogue in proper dosages.
+ Challenigng combat. I know for many this is a controversial subject of the game; "Ludonaritive Dissonance" and all that but I'm going to be easy here: it's fun. I think the violence fits the game fine and doesn't feel out of place. It starts of simple but get's more challenging as the game goes on. Read more about this below.
+ Unique. Though some would argue it doesn't innovate at all; Bioshock Infinite still manages to combine all it's aspects to deliver a truly novel experience.
+ Music and atmosphere. This game seems carefully crafted with a great sense of detail. This shines through in both the music and how most 'scenes' in the game play out. I'm sure it was playtested a lot.
+ DLC is decent. I was personally disappointed by Burial at Sea (save for the amazing first look at a "living" Rapture) But in the end I found Clash in the Clouds, the more basic "survival arena" mode, to be far more entertaining then first anticipated. 
+ It's archaic and a bit bare-bones; but your abilities can be upgraded as you progress. More health, salts, shield and the possibility to upgrade your guns and vigors isnt much but it's enough to keep you trying to find more cash in the flying city. 
+ Proper options and difficulty settings so you can make the game as easy or hard as you want it to be. I believe the achievements are fun for the completionists among us.

NOT-SO-GOODS
- As hinted before: people might think there is "ludonarritive dissonance" as they believe the gratuitous violence doesn't fit the main characters of the game; Elizabeth and Booker. I do NOT agree. But since many people do feel that way it has to be mentioned. More below.
- A limited experience as it's a single player game with a very linear plot. Very little room to explore or follow your own path. Goes double for the Burial at Sea DLC. It's a VERY solid linear experience though, just sad there's no big replay value for the common gamer.
- The standard combat music get's really repetitive after a while. Such a shame as the rest of the game's score is great.
- Some people dislike the "narrative through scattered audio logs"-cliche, which is understandable. It's a bit too "easy" I guess. Doesn't bother me much though! I'm one of those people who read all of 2016's DOOM''s logs and backstories and loved it. ^^; 
- People who know what this game looked like before release really hate how much was cut from the final product. You won't notice much if you're ignorant of it, but it's still a factor.
- Elizabeth's design has a little bit too much "Male gaze" going on. Forgivable to some because her character as a whole is just great.
- Far from the best combat we've seen from modern shooters. Thankfully this game has more to offer then just headshots.

And that's all for the lists, I'll just go off on a small tangent on any thing I couldn't mention and that'll be everything. Let me start by adressing the "ludonarrative dissonance"-issue: I believe people make too many assumptions. They say Booker acts too kind for the horrible things he does. Columbia looks too pretty to be a bad place. Elizabeth is too sweet to make some of the decisions she does. I got one simlpe retort: appearances can be deceiving is one of the central subjects of the game. And how many times have we heard of nice people that have done horrible things either because they were forced to, had no other choice or had to do something drastic to protect the things they held dear? And with that I say; there is no ludonaritive dissonance. Just people with poor knowledge of how complex human beings and their feelings are, their lack of understanding is not because of the game but because of themselves.

I believe the 'limited' combat is great. Many people really disliked the fact you can only hold 2 weapons at all times but to me it just felt like I had to prepare better when I was out of combat while also improvising when you're in the heat of battle with the weapons that your enemies drop. You don't have an entire catalog of explosives on you to get you out of any hairy situation that pops up; sometimes you just need to survive by the skin of your teeth so you better learn to do do both preperation and improvisation to be succesfull. Also makes it more interesting when you choose your favourite weapons to upgrade.

And finally I'd like to mention; (SPOILERS) the ending makes no sense according to the game's own rules. Many Youtube video's try to explain it all, but the answer is simple: the writers just bit off a bit more then they could chew. There's an infinite amount of Bookers and Elizabeths; drowning one Booker in a few timelines won't change that. On top of that: Elizabeth would never have her timespace-warping abilities if Comstock never existed so it's a full paradox. If she actually did manage to kill all infinite versions of Booker she killed herself as well... which means she could've never grown up to... kill herself? Yeah, see what I mean? Burial at Sea makes this even more of a mess; but I should quit here before we get in too deep.
(Get it? In too deep? Because Rapture's on the sea floor? No? Bad joke? Dammit!)

So that's all I have to say. In the end I absolutely recommend this title!
If you have any questions feel free to ask. Thank you very much for reading, I hope this helped you!
[h1]I know I'm 4 years late with a review of this game but I feel an urge to express my opinion about my favourite game, so here it is...[/h1]

[u] [b]The plot[/b] [/u]: Bioshock Infinite takes place on a floating utopia named Columbia (year 1912) where you play the role of Booker DeWit, a private investigator that recieved the job of finding a girl named Elizabeth and that way to erease his "debt".

The beautiful city of [u] [b]Columbia[/b] [/u] is at the surface a perfect place with perfect people but exploring and advancing in it you will find its dark moldy face. The city is the representation of extreme nationalism and religious fanaticism at its finnest form: propaganda posters and papers,patriotic music,rigorous clothing and behavior and the glorification showed to Zachary Comstock aka "The Prophet".

I'm not going to enter in the [u] [b]story[/b] [/u] trying to avoid any possible spoilers, but I must say it's the most outstanding storyline I have ever encountered in my life. [spoiler] <You are going to cry after a scrappy rusted fu***ng bird.> [/spoiler] Advancing in the city and learning its hidden controversated history it's a delight. Finding out about Booker life and Elizabeth secrets and true self it's going to keep you bonded with them the whole game.
It is the most mindf**k story I have seen in a game/movie/tv show/book untill now. You are gonna start questionig every little detail of the world and the story in the hope of understanding the game and find yourself in need to take some notes to not be overwhelmed by it. The story it's hard to comprehend, raising many questions and theories, but that is its beauty.

Regarding the [u] [b]graphics[/b] [/u], [u] [b]level design[/b] [/u], [u] [b]game/gunplay[/b] [/u] its perfect: graphically it is beautiful having an amazing verge between the "bright side" of the supposedly perfect place and the dark side of the story/true city. The gameplay it's easy to learn, the gunplay its smooth and basic (being there a gun for every category: pistol, handcannon, sniper, automatic, semi-automatic weapon having the option to upgrade them at the vending machines). The new part comes with [u] [b]the vigors[/b] [/u] which make the gameplay more fun (having the options to possess,freeze,stun <etc> your enemies). And also you can find gear that enhance certain abilities. [u] [b]The melee weapon[/b] [/u] can be used to travel across the zipline network of the city, that way being able to observe the beautiful level design and kill some patriots, of course.

[u] [b]Ultimately[/b] [/u], this is not just a game for me, it's a [b]masterpiece[/b]. Ken Levine and his team from Irrational Games did the best job with Infinite: the combination between breathtaking story, well established characters, outstanding graphic work and fluid gameplay is all I can demand from a game developing studio.

[h1]10/10 I would play again and start questioning about the size and the possibilities of the universe, realising that my mortal life is nothing in the long run for this obscure,dark place we exist in.[/h1]



 Ps. If you want more story,the answers for some questions and the link between Infinite and the first two games Burial at Sea Episode 1 and 2 is there for you.
Lets just say that I finished this game months ago and feel like I'll never find another game that had me so drawn in like this ever again. It really is a masterpiece.
" Give us the girl, wipe away the debt "

+ Columbia is gorgeous 
+ Brilliant chemistry between Booker and Elizabeth
+ Engaging gunplay 
+ Complex and great story
+ The feeling you get when you find out how dark the game is
+ One hell of an ending

- Linear 
- Gets repetitive
- Didn't find skylines that useful 

With its currently low price, this game is a steal
< 8.5 / 10 >

BioShock Infinite is the final entry in the BioShock franchise, and while it's quite different from the previous two games, I think it's a good way to end; especially once you play through Burial at Sea - Episode Two; but I'll talk about that in its own review. This one will talk exclusively about the main game, while I'll write reviews for each of the DLCs. So, on to the review!

What should I talk about first? I guess gameplay would be an important factor. In BioShock Infinite, the combat feels more frenetic; so to speak. Rather than focusing on exploration like the previous games, you'll usually move from one combat arena to the other; not literally, of course, there will be moments where you're free to explore a bit, but the game still feels pretty combat oriented. Not that it's something bad, considering that, in my opinion, the combat in this game is pretty good, with lots of options to dispatch enemies; from the different weapons, to the Vigors (Infinite's version of Plasmids), and Elizabeth's Tears. If there's something I'd complain about, though, is the fact that you're limited to carrying two weapons at the same time. Somewhat disappointing, but the variety of Vigors (and Vigor Combos) more than makes up for this. Also, the Sky-Hook is a great addition, allowing you to quickly move through certain areas, while also working as a melee weapon. Finally, there's the Tears. Elizabeth, who will be your companion for most of the game, can open them to bring things to help you out during combat, which is quite useful.

As for the story, well, it's pretty good in my opinion. It starts out somewhat "normal"; you're a guy sent to the city of Columbia to rescue a certain girl, but as it progresses, it gets more and more complex, in a good way. The characters are all pretty well written in my opinion, and a particular mention goes to the Lutece twins. Their dialogue always cracks me up a bit. Some people might feel that the main character, Booker, feels like a "regular" hero; you know, guy with a dark past, atoning for his sins, etc. Well, I'd say that's because, while being the playable character, Booker isn't the main character. The main character would be Elizabeth, and when you play through the game, it kinda makes sense. The story isn't about Booker's trip to Columbia, but rather about Elizabeth escaping from Columbia.

And now, I'll dedicate a paragraph to Elizabeth. Like I mentioned above, I feel that the game is more about Elizabeth than about Booker. After all, she is kind of the driving force behind the plot; what moves it forward. And like I also mentioned, she'll be your companion for most of the game. Even then, the game doesn't feel like a long escort mission. During combat, Elizabeth helps you out; not fighting enemies directly, but by providing you supplies, opening tears to bring in help, and even warning you of powerful enemies. Outside combat, she'll wander on her own; not going too far away from you, but she'll still look at things that interest her, and might even find things you missed; she can also open doors for you through lockpicking. I think they did a great job at giving her a personality; she doesn't feel like another NPC at all, but rather as an actual person. Still, there are a few details here and there; just as an example, when lockpicking, she'll usually talk in a cheerful tone, which can feel out of place when, only a few minutes before, she was angry at Booker for something he did.

The environments are superb. The city of Columbia is a pretty beautiful place, and I can see why they went with the "city in the sky" theme rather than going back to the bottom of the ocean. Not to say that Rapture wouldn't have looked good; in fact, you'll get to visit it in its prime in Burial at Sea! However, having a different setting was interesting, with 1912's Columbia providing a nice contrast to 1950's Rapture. The level design, by itself, is pretty good; still, most of the places you'll visit feel like combat arenas, consisting of big, open spaces, unlike Rapture's labyrinth-like structure. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.

Well, I think that's all I can say about BioShock Infinite. Personally, my favourite BioShock game is BioShock 2, but even then, I think Infinite is an excellent game, which is why I recommend it.
BioShock saga is one of the best games ever made.

But this game.......man, this game is freaking amazing.

Ken Levine, I thank you for let me playing this masterpiece.
No words, excellent first-person shooter, and still Aerotrack there! Rich graphics and cool story! Here you can immediately give a rating of 10/10. Interesting and addictive gameplay. The voice acting, the soundtrack to the occasion, decided to take "BioShock Infinite" Thanks to the developers for this masterpiece!

Having beaten this game, and all of the DLC, I can strongly say that this is among the best written game series that I have ever played. The characters are well developed, the score very well done and placed, the dialog very well written, and the ending exceedingly perfect. You are missing out on a lot of the story, if you do not play the two Burial at Sea additions. 

The not being able to save bothered me at first, but I found that it actually helped to keep me from forgetting important immersion points, from how it begins each chapter. The method is actually an improvement, in my opinion, as opposed to the save anywhere option. The challenging difficulty was fantastic. I had immense trouble at some points, making it require actually strategy, instead of just banging your head against a wall until you get through. While that might work at times, and the Clash in the Clouds addition does feel like that, this game benefits the person who uses a methodical approach, rather than guns blazing.

I have read some have become of sudden experts on quantum physics, and they dismiss the ending of the main game. From Doctor Who, Star Trek, Time Machine and many other movies who have done such ideas of paradoxes, there is no straight answer to how it could or could not work. I did feel a bit at odds with the ending, despite it being very well done from its own individual point, but having playing Burial at Sea 1 and 2, I can now say the writers of this game, and the additional content, are simply amazing.

While I hear rumors of a fourth addition to the Bioshock series, and I hope that it does come to fruition, this series could end respectfully here. 

In short, this is a must play game, if nothing else, for the story. You will need to have played the first Bioshock to get the fullness of the story, though Bioshock 2 is just filler, it is a worthy part of the series as well, if you enjoyed the first and third part of the series.

Dimwit gets it on G2A and leaves a negative review without playing it!

BE THE DUKE, NOT THE DIMWIT.
[i]Should I even write a review? Bioshock Infinite is probably my favorite game so far. How exactly I am going to show my love and appreciation for the whole Bioshock series and this entry, in particular? By writing a positive review and bolstering the ranks of the rest of the 50K? Yeah, Imma do that.[/i]

[h1]TL;DR[/h1] I greatly enjoyed Bioshock Infinite and all of its aspects. The story and setting are excellently done, the gameplay is quite great, and I especially appreciate its steampunk beauty, so different from gloomy Rapture. Yes, the theme of travelling between universes is a tricky one and may bring a lot of plotholes - as well as resolutions to them; and this theme is what makes the plot so delicious. I recommend the game without any doubt to anyone willing to pay attention to the story.

[h1][b]Bioshock Infinite[/b] is a masterpiece. [/h1]

I love [b]the intricate and complex plot and storyline[/b] that will not miss a beat in hitting you with constant waves of enjoyment and wondering, delivering a deep emotional experience. Toying with time-space warping concept may not be a good design decision, but in Bioshock Infinite it pays off. Yes, it can add a lot of confusion and possible plot holes to the story. Yes, there may be some "deus ex machina" moments regarding infinite universes, and where an explanation which is only somewhat good covers what can work in there and what can't. And yes, it also makes the plot so deliciously, deliciously wonderful as it is.

I adore the immersive [b]retro-sci-fi steampunk setting[/b] and feast my eyes on the [b]breathtaking visuals[/b] of a beautiful flying city of Columbia, and I like how these visuals gradually change to depict the current state of the story. Starting from the beginning till the very end, you will be captivated by the charming color palette so different from gloomy Rapture. The level design is gorgeous, and there is a possibility to explore, to look for collectibles such as voxophones that explain the story and lore more in detail.

I admire [b]the characters[/b] and [b]their development[/b] (and their looks, of course), the journey, in which that grim war veteran turned Pinkerton and a mysterious, naive but ultimately adorable girl evolve, exploring the impact of their past on them and their impact on the future. Hell, I don't even consider Comstock to be the main villain.

I relish [b]the gameplay[/b], in which the player has a multitude of ways to approach his enemies - be that blazing them down from a skyline, staying at the safe distance using long-range weapons, vigors (a.k.a. plasmids, a.k.a. magic) and Tears (another kind of inter-dimensional magic), or fight up close and personal, using all of their mighty arsenal. Vigors are what really makes the difference, as it replaces Plasmids from the previous entries, but adds much more variety and feels much more fun, in fusion with Tears. The restriction to carrying only two guns at a time only increases the tension. And with introduction of sky-hooks, Bioshock has never felt so great with added vericality.

With all that said, Bioshock Infinite makes one of the best games of the decade for me.
I whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone. Buy it, have fun, and don't forget to pay attention.
[u][i]"Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt."[/i][/u]

P.S. Don't miss the DLCs. They are one of the best additions to original games I've seen. The Burial at Sea episodes expand the connection between Columbia and Rapture, and are a great emotional conclusion to the series.

[b]Thank you, Irrational Games.[/b]
9/10: Bioshock Infinite tops off the Bioshock series by going from the objectivist waters of Rapture to the racist skies of Columbia. All the superpowers and gunplay of the first two, with an extra twist of quantum craziness.

Bioshock Infinite is similar to its two predecessors, yet quite different at the same time. It's still first person, but instead of playing the classic silent protagonist, you're now in the role of Booker DeWitt, a jaded private eye tasked to "bring back the girl and wipe away the debt." You still get plenty of cool powers by drinking strange glowing fluids, but they're called Vigors instead of Plasmids. Most of all, the story is a linear experience that still immerses you in the history and struggles of the place you find yourself in, granting context to the strange and often distressing idiosyncracies that define life in Columbia.

The game uses quantum mechanics and multiverse theory liberally, explaining everything from why the city of Columbia stays up in the air to what Elizabeth's unique powers do. Elizabeth is the young woman Booker has been tasked to retrieve, and operates simultaneously as the "princess in the tower" and "deus ex machina." As such she is naive but possesses astounding potential, able to actualize other possibilities by opening up "tears" much like someone might open a window or a door. Thankfully, rather than being a game-length escort mission, Elizabeth contributes significantly to the fight by tossing Booker supplies when he's low and actualizing cover and turrets on a whim. As a result, there's actual value that she provides to the player, further reinforcing the connection between Booker and Elizabeth through the games mechanics. 

However, there are several major changes that set Infinite apart from Bioshock 1 and 2. Combat is more vertical than before thanks to the addition of skyhooks and rails, allowing you to zip around the level and reach areas in the more open environments around Columbia. Upgrading is now entirely based on money, rather than requiring ADAM to upgrade your powers. You can't hack like before, so hostile turrets either need to be destroyed or possessed to avoid getting gunned down. 

As for the use of voiced characters, particularly in the protagonist role, it's a a mixed blessing. On the one hand, there's actual dialogue between the main characters, and the story is stronger for having those moments between Booker and Elizabeth. On the other hand though, the narrative dissonance is more noticeable than before as well, particularly when Booker goes from providing insightful commentary on the conflict to scavenging corpses and garbage for any stray bit of food or coin he can find. 

The narrative is excellent on its own and is made even better with the Burial at Sea DLC, which helps officially connect Infinite to the stories of Bioshock 1 and 2. The quantum silliness in Infinite sometimes make it difficult to keep causality straight, but it's fascinating seeing the "constants and variables" between Rapture and Columbia explained in depth. 

Ultimately, Bioshock Infinite is a worthy conclusion to the series, taking the frantic fights and heady story of its predecessors and adding in some new mechanics so the experience feels fresh. Definitely worth a play for anyone that enjoys first person shooters with strong narratives.
[i] BioShock Infinite has a great story and gameplay, but what's exactly BioShock Infinite? [/i]

[h1] Overview: [/h1]
In the story line, your main character will be Booker DeWitt a private detective with a simple task to finding a girl (Elizabeth) in the flying city of Columbia.
Columbia is a flying city that is amazing, fascinating, full of colors and with a beautiful living world, but even if it all sounds pretty, there is also a question of racism. The game takes place in 1912 and it's hella atmospheric.

[i] "When I first seen Columbia, that sky was the brightest, bluest sky that there ever was. Seemed like Heaven. Then your eyes adjusted to the light, and you see that sea of white faces looking hard back at you." [/i]

[h1] Fighting/guns [/h1]
Other parts of the game are, of course, violence and shooting. The first in your hand will be the Sky-Hook, which will serve you both in combat and when moving in a flying city, and then firearms like Pistol, Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, Machine Gun and the great Hand Cannon. Weapons and abilities (vigors) can be improved. Sky-Hook's can completely change your play style when you shoot and move through the Skylines to the other side of the battlefield. This makes the fight a definitive 3D.

[h1] Vigors [/h1]
In in the previous Bioshock games we had plasmids in the BioShock Infinite you'll have vigors. Vigors are of different kinds like lightning, fire, etc. But you will find it by yourself.

[h1] Elizabeth [/h1]
I have already mentioned Elizabeth, who has the finest eyes in the world, and will help you in the fight when she look for an ammunition or a medical supplies and believe or not but that will be very helpful in your fights. She can also open space-time cracks.
Elizabeth girl you fall in love with, girl who stand by your side for the whole story. 
The story is fascinating, but telling something more would be very bad, so I recommend everyone to play it.

[spoiler] "Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt." [/spoiler]

[h1] Overall [/h1]
Anyone who played this game before will understand that the shooter style is good, but the best thing is when the story comes to the word. A stunning shooter with a fascinating story and the stunning Elizabeth, who is the nicest character ever in the virtual world.

[spoiler] "Booker, are you afraid of God? 
No. But I'm afraid of you." [/spoiler]

ـــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــــ
 >> A Masterpiece ,,

 Highly recommended
This is a gorgeous and marvelous Bioshock game I ever played. I'm sorry I didn't get the time to play the first two Bioshocks, but this one is incredible. Both DLCs are worth to check it out since it includes good pieces of the history. Highly recommend.
Bioshock series has one of the best story in the gaming industry, i even read the book, it is marvelous. Plus fun gameplay, vigors that make the game playable again (actually it is replayable even without vigors...). Long story short, play this gem.

9.5/10
This is a great game. Not perfect but certainly one of the best games since HL2. Been so busy playing I forgot to recommend it! The heart of this story is the relationship between the two main characters Booker and Elizabeth. This is unlike BioShock were it was about the City of Rapture. It is a much more personal story. A story of regret about the choices you have made and how they change you. It is also about how a differant choice could be much worse than the one you made and that at times what choice you make does not really change anything. There is a lot of mind bending things going on with quantum physics and the like which can be a bit hard to understand at times. But if you pay attention it is all explained though it might take a little thinking to put it together. sm
[b]Easily in my top 10 favourite games[/b]

It looks great, whether you're inside or out, the sound affects are nice and really create a great atmosphere, and the story was a real suprise!
The gun-play is good, the 'vigor' (think superpowers) system is fun and makes combat interesting, and the upgrade system makes weapons & powers better-er (more fun & more bang)


[i]I didn't play the first 2 Bioshock games so I cannot compare them.. so I guess I should do that[/i] 👌
This is a gem of a game. When I finished Bioshock 1 the ending really caught me off gaurd and I never thought there could be a game which could match that but Inifnite just blew every other game I've played right out of the water.
A must play for literally everyone!
I cannot even begin to explain just how much I love this game. Or at least I love it now.

When it first released, I was more than a tiny bit skeptical. However don't be fooled, I gave it a shot..but it just didn't have that BioShock feel to it.

Years after the release I decided to give the game another attempt to win me over, which I'm glad to say that it did. By simply thinking of BioShock Infinite as its own separate game and not as a direct sequel to the first 2 games it immediately became amazing. So amazing that this is the second time that I've bought the game.

The voice acting is wonderful, the characters become important to you...just play it for yourself if you haven't already.

You won't be disappointed.
For newcomers or original Bioshock players, this installment can be a great entry/re-entry into the series because how the DLC would connect all the stories together, but even the base game itself would tease the landscape of Bioshock universe throughout the adventure.

Can you recall the last time when a game sucked you into a story, made you so intrigued that after the first play through you would spend days to think and reconnect about nothing but the story? Forget about the game play, forget about limitation on weapon choices, and forget about how different it is compare to the original game. Bioshock:Infinite is a game that can be played solely for its narratives, music, and environment. Please do not let the naysayers deter you from this beautiful game because of "ZOMG muh freedom compare to the original Bioshock".


[i]Perception without comprehension is a dangerous combination[/i] - Robert/Rosalind Lutece
A must buy on sale. Modern classic. For anyone who loves games with good story and characters.  

Another great game into the Bioshock franchise. The gameplay mechanics and shooting are very different from earlier titles hence some of the negative reviews. Combat is more "on the fly" sort of action then the careful methodical planning in Rapture. If you're playing on normal or lesser difficulty, most combat don't even need the usage of Plasmids/Vigors. Enemies are also somehow less exciting and mundane but comes in larger numbers. 

The characters in the game and the story are amazing. They feel very real and you could see them developing as actual people. You could play the entirety of the game and be satisfied with it but I would high recommend buying the story DLCs to tie Infinite's story with the events of B1. 


With it's bubbly and bright city of Columbia and the deep narrative between Booker and Elizabeth, Bioshock infinite offers what a lot of other games out there have both attempted to do and mimic and have failed, and that is offer a compelling story that is filled with twists, turns, and occasional comedy wile also combining a compelling story with fun and fresh mechanics. The gunplay is excellent, and each "Vigor" you try offers a new and unique power only available to use with said Vigor. Bioshock Infinite's beautiful skies are almost as much a masterpiece as the game itself, as this game not only plays beautifully in many regards but looks just as beautiful in so many more. In conclusion, whether you're a shooter fan, RPG fan, or video game fan in general Bioshock Infinite is a must-have for anyone's collection.

From me, it gets a 10/10.
This Game is one of the best games i've ever played. 
The story is flashing but complex.
The Graphics and cutscenes are beautiful.
The open world is stirring.

The only "contra" i have is the gameplay. In the beginning it's weird to walk around, look around or aim on something. But if you play for a short while you will get confortable with that and be able to enjoy the whole game.

10/10 would buy it again.
I am so in love with this game. Before i decided to download it, i felt hesitated and i doubt that i was going to finish the game since i rarely play a single-player shooting game. The design and the graphic is quite breathtaking, i love the whole universe, also the weapons are quite easy and varied.
You have to play this game. It is an amazing game but also an experience. A must play for anyone. 11/10.

Probs my favourite game of all time or close to it.
Played this game 5 hours straight. I think its fair to say i like this game ^^

Nice and intensive story telling that keeps you playing for little longer, then suddenly 2 hours flew by without you knowing it. Oh and for being a game that's 6 years old, the graphics aged really well!
Don't wanna play game alone? With Infinite you don't have to, now come with a cute, smart companion !
The environment takes your breath away with its deadly charms.
Be warned, finishing the game will leave you hollowed, like finishing a book or movie. 


This is a game that i want to find but only rarely can find. These games I'm talking about change my entire life temporarily but they also change my taste on games permanently. Before, I never thought of ever getting a steampunk game. The idea of everything being mechanical and steam-powered was cool but i found it being a little bit ridicilous until just now. I simply loved the story. It was very charming and deep. You had to think about what was happening to perceive the game. It was not simple like a loved-one getting assasinated and you going out to seek revenge. The gameplay was smooth. I first thought there were only going to be the essential weapons like pistol, shotgun and sniper. But i was wrong. More or customizable upgrades to weapons would be appreciated though. Vigors were also good but i wanted a Vigor that could be used even more mainly than the weaponry or at least the same the entire game. In the end, my experience was perfect with this game. It is a great game and now, i want more... I think now i'm a bioshock fan.
Its the first game I purchased a physical copy of & I am glad I did.Its a game worth playing.I am planning to get other 2 games of the franchise but still don't know which versions to get...If anyone have any suggestion you are welcome to comment... :)

This game is really good and I strongly urge you to play it because the voice acting animation everything is so and how you place with all the different abilities to progress into the story.
It's not milking and reskin FPS games that always get new series every year or 2 years and even 2 series every years until their fans getting tired.

The dev know how to make masterpiece in story and gameplay mechanic that make so different than generic fps games.

You can use sniper rifle or RPG launcher just with one hand while the other hand hold vigor
Ya want an FPS Environmental Steampunk Drama/Action kind of game? GET IT. THIS LOOKS TOO REAL AND SOUNDS LIKE ONE TOO. Got my ass hooked for almost 10 hours. Get that 10/10.
If you liked BioShock 1 and 2 for the gameplay, this game is a fine addition to the franchise. But if you liked BioShock 1 and 2 for the story, this one pales in comparison.

I feel like Infinite had a lot of potential, especially with its setting firmly rooted in extreme patriotism, evangelical zionism, Jim Crow-era white supremacy and segregation, and exploitation of the poor working class American...and then failed to deliver any meaningful or impactful story point, and actually UNDERCUT its own message by playing the "both sides are equally bad" card with Daisy. The twist at the end is certainly a twist, but it feels very unfulfilling. I honestly feel like the game's story suffers from severely wasted potential, and fails to deliver any meaningful or impactful story out of it. I walked away from the game thinking "wow, white christian evangelicals kinda suck, huh." Which, let's be honest, I've already known for YEARS.

But if you're just in it for all the cool sci-fi concepts and creative ways to kill people using magical alcoholic beverages, it runs smooth, looks great, and will probably slake your bloodlust for a while.

Otherwise? Not recommended.
- Checkpoint saves
- Console-first design
- Battles are simplistic, confined to smallish open arenas
- Emptiness of the environment (no other people other than enemies around) doesn't make sense in the context of the game
- No real sense of exploration, just roller-coastering from one small island to another
+ Parts of it are awful purty
- Story line is incredibly heavy-handed
- Doesn't feel like a Bioshock game
Fairly fun, but doesn't feel like a true Bioshock game. The biggest downfall of this game was the 2 weapon maximum. Also plasmids were useless most of the time if you had an upgraded weapon.
Didn't like it.

I didn't like the clumsy BOTH SIDES narrative, and the sanitized depiction of oppression.

I didn't like the vigors, as they were shoehorned in and not a part of the narrative like plasmids in Bioshock.

I didn't like the gunplay. Only two guns at a time? A dumb upgrade system? What's the point.

The story is stupid, and mistakes being confusing with being deep.
I tried to write a comprehensive review, but the following sums up my opinion:

It's just not a good game, and it feels worse after playing the more fun previous entries.

Hmm. For my taste, this game went one step too far into the direction of modern game design. Everything feels very simplified and streamlined gameplay-wise. It does have its good moments definitely, work went into it, and it's neither unfinished nor buggy, but games that baby-sit you for even the simplest things you do all game just don't quite cut it for me.

It's not even that the game was too easy, but it is just too far dumbed-down for what its focus is. Yes, year-2000 games sometimes overdid it with the (e.g.) inventory micro-management, but it was an important part of the games, and removing it completely makes it lack an important aspect of what's going on.
This is a horrible, horrible port of a game with pretty decent story and shitty gameplay that most people will only rate positively because they played on medium difficulty which doesn't present a challenge.
Pros:
- Story is cool
- Visual style
Cons:
- Enemies hit you through walls, never miss even if you're sprinting perpendicularly to their line of sight far away
- The camera bobs like Booker's a drunk the whole time
- Can barely turn when sprinting
- Sometimes the camera just refuses to respond mid combat because you started another action and everything in this game takes control of the camera
- Aiming down sights is unusable because some moron put a DEADZONE ON MOUSE CONTROLS
- Enemy design and balance goes perfectly against the weapon and ability design, making the combat annoying at best and frustrating at worst
- You can get softlocked by not having enough ammo to finish a fight and enemies not dropping any either
- Map design is ass
- Sound design is a crime - get ready for literally painful sound effects
- Weapons feel bad to use because they don't cause much impact nor do they deal much damage
- Uninteresting progression system forces you to specialize so you won't be using most of the abilities because they need to be leveled up to be remotely useful
- No information about where you're getting damaged from in the UI
- Directional sound is always a bit off for some reason
- Game crashes if you limit the framerate
- You can't really adjust mouse sensitivity unless you go into config files
What a mess.
This is a great game. But it's too short to justify a 30 dollar price tag, hence the thumbs down. There's about ten-twenty hours of content here at the absolute most. I got it on sale for about 8$ and I'm not disappointed. If I payed 30$ I would be extremely disappointed. Pick it up on sale if you can. It's a great game to play over a long weekend.
Didn't quite understood the hype this game had when it came out. As its prequels it is confusing, the gameplay is not that great (you cant aim for sh*t) and the story, while intricate, is very slow to develop. But I am keen to give it another try, and maybe I'll write another analysis then.
For now 2/5.
It's an average shooter with pretty visuals and a story so far up it's own ass its gushing over itself in a mirror through its own esophagus. Skyrail shooting sections were fun though.
