Cities: Skylines is a very in depth, complex, and well-made city building game. As if you couldn't have guessed that already. It allows you, in its basic state (that being without DLC or mods), to create a city from a fair variety of maps, each with different things going for them such as water quantity, oil reserves, building area etc. Your task is, simply, to get as many people to live in your city, keep them happy, make it as good as you can, and make a load of money. The same as the government’s job, really. Except the "keeping people happy bit"...yeah...

The game allows you to design and expand a city with the use of many tools such as zoning, district planning and other features that let you change the smaller, more intricate details of your city. You can set different laws within your districts to make them work more efficiently at what you want them to do. I feel like this is all done really well. I have not got any DLC's, and only recently did I get a few mods, but I don't feel like the game ever really needed them.
Over the course of your cities expansion, you will face challenges. You must supply water, electric and road access to people, and zone your areas well to create a nice amount of residential, commercial and industrial areas. As the demand for them increases, it is expected that you appease them. You will also have to work around the formation of the land that you are on to make your city as functional and as sustainable as it can be, otherwise it will lack in efficiency, and perhaps upset the people. If they don’t like your city, they will first stop paying taxes, making it much harder for you to amend your previous errors. After that, they will leave, and you will be very lonely in that ghost town of yours. And probably quite angry as you’ll have to start a new game again. One problem that is hard to manage is the flow of traffic. You must make reliable and efficient road networks throughout your city, otherwise it will become stagnant. Public services such as busses will be rendered useless, nobody will be able to get to work, and emergency services will be crippled if your roads are congested all the time. 

As your city progresses in size, the feature is available to you to buy more land, thus enabling you to continue your expansion. Eventually, if you are good enough at this game, you will fill the maximum amount of land you can buy, at which point, you’ll probably be feeling quite proud of yourself. Well done. 

Overall, I would rate this game a well-earned 10/10. I can’t really fault it on anything. Out of all the city building games out there, this is the most detailed and intricate, while remaining fun to play, and enjoyably challenging. Graphically, it looks great, and the gameplay feels smooth. It has to be the best game of its type.
I like playing cities alot. I have Cerebral Palsy and use a HeadMouse to work the computer.  Its one of the few games that will work with my HeadMouse. Its hard finding games that I can play because I don't have use of my hands. I would recomme it to anyone with a disability.
This is an outstanding game. This is an exceptionally outstanding citybuilder game, in a genre that for too long, has been deeply troubled with over-casualization, poor optimization, ill-thought out concepts, microtransactions, and general publisher shenangans.

[h1]Positives[/h1]

* Excellent Performance. I find that my city runs extremely well on my laptop even as it grows. I have not really noticed any dips in performance. The game seamlessly transitions between following an entity, and zooming out to broadly appreciate my traffic network.

* Intuitive game mechanics. I was able to jump straight in and make assumptions about mechanics that made sense, and those were reflected in the game. As an example, I assumed people would use a variety of methods to get to work (hop on the metro, then take a bus), When I tracked people, they would do this.

* Full Simulation. Things just make sense, you build a dam - the water level raises. People go to the store. People go to work. The water gets dirty from pollution. I get a sense that the city is a living and breathing entity - it gives me context to the experience.

* Free, Focused Construction. You place roads and zones freely, focused around the placement of the roads. The zones are indelibly linked to this. It was a great design decision and simplifies the more annoying aspects of construction. It also makes the transport very obvious as one of the key aspects of the game.

[h1]Negatives[/h1]

* The listed city population seems much lower than it should be. My city looks like it should be about 100,000 people, but the listed population is only 30,000. 

* Not enough snapping options. This makes it really hard to make your own cloverleaf in highways if you are particulary OCD about this kind of thing, it's almost impossible to make angles of a similar basis repeatedly.

* The Metro + Bus placement lacks feedback and is difficult to expand once done. I feel that you are really fairly blindly approaching this, at least at the start. Over time I might grow to understand this more. Also the numbers don't often line up well. My metro station might say "100 per week" but in the overall transport graph only 20 people are said to be using the metro.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

If you like citybuilders, buy this game. Not since SimCity 4 Rush Hour have I enjoyed an experience this much. I find it hard to suggest major ways to improve the concept. I strongly dislike casual approaches to the genre, and this is not one of those. Yet I also think it makes the genre more accessible.
In 2013, after 10 years of waiting, the Sim City community of modders, fans, and aficionados rushed out to purchase the fifth installment of Sim City. Ten years is a long time to wait for a game, but people had a lot of faith in Maxis when they announced the title. Long story short, it was a massive dissapointment. Maxis and EA crippled Sim City 5 with DRM, Always On APM, tiny maps, forced origin installation, lacking mod support, no steam support, and a forced multiplayer aspect.  I decided to not purchase the title, so it may have been a decent game, but 2 years later a team of 12 people created a game that does everything maxis insisted was utterly and totaly impossible.  

Everything the mod community did that kept Sim City 4 on the shelves in Wallmarts across America for an entire decade was ignored. Maxis (and to a lesser extent EA) ignored the fans, and gave the people who had kept them in business for twenty years a crippled subpar game.  And for that Maxis is now out of business. They will never make another game, and it is no one's fault but theirs.

Now pretend none of that happened. It's 2013 again, and here it is people: Sim City 5. 

The game balance is a bit on the easy side for veterans of the genre, but the potential map size is ENOURMOUS and customizing your city could fill up years of gameplay time.  The game runs so smoothly with so much going on, it really shows how lazy Maxis was with their approach.  The glass in buildings reflects the sun and the buildings near it, there are dynamic shadows, zoning is back, and it is not 'dumbed down'.  A single tile in this game is twice the size of the alloted map in Sim City, and you can purchase dozens of additional tiles to expand.  The map editor is awesome, the community is thriving, there are mods to do anything you want, and this is the city building game we've all been waiting for.  I can not possibly reccomend this more.
This really is the greatest city simulator there is, and will be for quite a long time. I'm having trouble finding ANYthing wrong with this game. I've played most SimCity's, Anno 2070, Cities XL and almost fell for the Cities XXL nonsense. Then I found this game, and my life is complete.

Some of the things worth noting:
- The UI is simple but intuitive, it doesn't have that featureless feeling some of the plainer UI's have.
- The game itself runs incredibly well, however you do need a good processor and a few GB of RAM to play it idealy.
- Gameplay is silky smooth and addicting, no glitches or anything. There's even a little in-engine physics to things like cars, rivers and trees.
- Road design is incredibly free and grid layouts are 100% accurate, unlike 2013's Simcity.
- Full workshop and in-game modding support with an expanding community and many interesting items and maps to choose from, Copper Creek on the workshop is my favorite.
- This list just goes on and on...

The only thing I can really notice being undesirable (to a small extent, it's not really a big deal) are things like garbage and deathcare. They tend to get overwhelming and lots of weekly money needs to be spent to fix them. (When your landfills are full or more people are dying than you can transport to a cemetary kind of thing) I'd recommend finding something better on the workshop or using the asset editor to lower/raise some gampleay values in those buildings slightly.

Just a fair little heads up to newcomers, your citizens in this game are born, age, and die eventually. Don't worry though, they'll be replaced by their children for the largest part. But there may be a point in the game where a lot of people suddenly die and it's a little scary. This is because of your senior citizens getting a little too old. if you know what I mean. Be sure to prepare for this if you find it to happen, I am not completely certtain if it's just that playrhrough of mine of if it's actually a phenomenon within the game.   :P

To sum it up and make it nice and short for you, this game really is a worthwhile investment and it honestly, coming from someone who's a dear city-builder fan, steps on all the other titles and I mean ALL of them. You'll love it.

Find my review helpful? Have anything to say or any constructive criticism to give? No problem! Let me know!
For 2 weeks I debated purchasing [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] (I'm sure I annoyed most of my friends by weighing the pros and cons with them!) Eventually I said, "screw it" and made the purchase: I have not regretted it since.

In a nut shell, [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] is your basic city simulator. You start off with a blank landscape and a highway off to the side, of which is the key to growing your sprawling city. Sounds very simple, yes? Well, not quite. [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b] [/i]goes beyond just throwing houses and shops together. You're required to check pollutants in the form of ground and noise, dissiptating clogged roadways, providing entertainment, and so much more. Essentially, this game is everything that you could ever ask for in a simulator.

[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]

[h1]Pros[/h1]
+ Replayability value is here 100%
+ Sound effects are great and very life-like
+ The graphics, my oh my, the graphics - they are absolutely stunning; if you're able to play on high graphics, then go for it. The view is very rewarding and satisfying. Great job, [i]Colossal[/i]!
+ There is always something to look out for: budgeting, job and housing demands, etc. This game is definitely no joke. It demands your every attention and is not something you can just idle
+ Related to the graphics point: I love how this game works so well on my non-gaming laptop. I have a Toshiba E45T which is not one by any means. This game is so well optimised, I can still enjoy it to its fullest though
+ The "basic" version of [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] offers a lot at a decent price. If your budget is fairly tight, then disregard the [i]Deluxe Edition[/i] unless you really want 5 extra monuments (plus as a way to support the developer's further). You can always get the 5 extra monuments through the workshop

[h1]Neutral[/h1]
± DLC's are a bit pricey and I'm not sure if it's really worth it. In the end, it's your call 

[b][u]Update 26 May, 2016: I've finally gotten around to purchasing both DLC's and I'll provide a brief breakdown.[/u][/b]
 
[i][b]After Dark[/b] DLC[/i]: comes with some new lanes and a couple edicts, leisure and tourism specializations (night clubs, etc.), and extra buildings. Some people are noting that it comes with a night and day cycle, but I was experiencing the cycle without the DLC... maybe I'm just confusing something!

[i][b]Snowfall[/b] DLC[/i]: snow, obviously, hah! Also snowmaps, snowplows and snowpiles, more edicts and heating systems. 

[i][b]Verdict[/b][/i]: In my opinion, the DLC's are not worth it at their full price. Yes, they serve to enhance gameplay and also act as a way for you to support the developer's as well. With the little amount of content that both of them offer, however, and at $12+ price tags, I'd say your money would be better spent elsewhere. So, either wait until the DLC's are cheaper (I'd say under $8 would be more appropriate), avoid the DLC's completely, or just splurge because you want to. If you're an achievement hunter like me, then you'll need to purchase the DLC's. 

If budget is an issue, then I would suggest getting [i]After Dark[/i] first. It has been much more enjoyable due to it's far more superior offering of content. Quite frankly, I haven't even really played with [i]Snowfall[/i] since it doesn't offer much beyond its name. It's completely up to you!

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Realistic traffic please! (There is a mod for this though)
- Can there be an undo button? It would be extremely helpful
- Connecting roads can be a real hassle at times, especially when you're looking to upgrade them
- Would be very useful if we could just upgrade buildings for a fee, such as the Cargo Harbour to Hub (without having to go through the process of destroying it first)

[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]

All in all, [i][b]Cities: Skylines[/b][/i] is honestly one of the best purchases I have ever made to date on Steam. I've already lost 22+ hours since my purchase 4 days ago, and it has left me impressed each time I've exited the game. If you're into simulators, I highly recommend this one - I hope it leaves as much of an impression on you as it has on me.

With an abundance of content and a plethora of mods being developed (or already developed), you seriously can't go wrong with this title. Bravo, [i]Colossal Order[/i] and [i]Paradox Interactive[/i], bravo: thank you for this amazing game.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
9.5/10

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask - I will answer them to the best of my ability. On that note, cheers and happy building!

[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]

[b]Update 11 June, 2016[/b]: FREE STADIUM DLC! Thank you, [i]Colossal Order[/i] - this game just gets better and better. You never fail to impress with the amount of dedication and love you have for your game.

[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]

[h1]Worthy Questions & Answers[/h1]
1) Can this game be played offline (credits to ru): Yes, yes this game can be played offline! I've done around  7 hours of gameplay offline (due to power outages). That didn't stop me from getting on this game though!
2) Does the game require a lot of attention (credits to ru): the great thing about this game is that, while it does require micromanagement, it doesn't necessarily need a lot. You can leave the game in order to run an errand if you choose. I've left it for around 10 minutes before - always came back to a 99% operational city (those dead bodies, yo. Keep piling up!)

[h1]---------------------------------------------------------[/h1]
[h1]UPDATED MARCH 2016[/h1]
Alright, let me start this off with this. If you already love city-builders, this is for you. If you don't already like city-builders, this is a great place to start!

I personally love city-building games and I can't really believe that many of the things that they acomplished (either totally  or partially) were done. The traffic AI has been
 greatly improved since release.

Pros:
- CURVY ROADS
- Adustable height of the roads allowing for customized interchanges
- Renewable Energy is the main power source that you will use.
- Train/Subway/Bus Routs are editable and can be color coordinated.
- Cities grow based upon services and leisure and educated near them.
- Mods, 74,000+ mods.
- Intuituve Menu Layout
- Great AI
- Base Game is worth the price

Cons: 
- DLC has too little content for too high a price.

Yeah that's all the cons. If I had to I would give this game a very nice 93/100. It's got a lot of polish added to it and it's worth every cent you put into it. Buy this, you won't regret it at all.
This is definitely the SimCity successor.  Cities: Skylines is what SimCity 2013 should be.  Although the graphic is nice and the city scaling up through playing, the performance is still good and not laggy at all.  Cities: Skylines features lots of system (such and pollution, traffic, water, power, etc) and large maps (you may expand your city by buying the lands) and lots of building options, creating tons of fun while running a city!

+Rich game contents.
+Tons of city systems.  Including transport, pollution, water, power, entertainment, public service, etc.
+6 types of zoning, such as residential, commercial, industrial, office, etc.
+District planning tool, allow you to apply policies base on districts or city-wide.
+5 different industry types: generic, forest, farming, oil, ore.
+Buildings will level up with time.
+Lots of traffic options, numerous types of road, public transport, cargo ships, trains, airplane, etc.
+6 road level to build, you may create high complex road design, even helix-shaped road and more.
+Environmental effect, pollution flow with river, the dam will affect the water level, polluted water will make citizens sick, etc.
+Superb finance and tax system.
+No laggy, even with a huge city you can still smoothly run your city.
+Cinema camera mode, hide all UI and allow you to take splendid screenshots.
+Offline gameplay, no need to connect to online server to build your cities.
+Highly mod support through Steam Workshop, infinite gameplay possibility and extended experience.

[strike]-No autosave, but there's a mod to do this.[/strike] Edit 2015.09.02: We have this option built in-game now!
[strike]-No day-night cycle, but there's a mod to do this.[/strike] Edit 2015.09.02: There's a DLC to patch this on 24th, Sep, 2015!
-No first-person camera, but there's a mod to do this.
-No random map, but there are tons of awesome maps in Steam Workshop.

If you were a fan of SimCity, you must try Cities: Skylines.  This is "the" city simulation game you're dreaming of.  Highly recommended!

[h1][b]Cities Skylines Review[/b][/h1]
                                    
Its been a long time since a really good City Builder has been on the market so every time there is a whisper of a new one being developed, fans of the genre like myself become eager with anticipation. Unfortunately, we have been left wanting for nearly a decade. Yes, its been that long since a really decent sim has been released. Upon learning that one of my favorite publishers, Paradox Interactive, had a City Building simulation in the works I knew this was a game I could not wait to get my hands on. Paradox Interactive is known for being a leader in challenging and entertaining  strategic games so I felt if anybody could do it right, they could. Having been able to test the game for almost a full week before its official release I can say that my trust was not misplaced. Cities Skylines is everything I hoped it would be. This is city building done right.

I have played most every City Building game ever made and consider myself somewhat of an expert in the genre. Perhaps I am over-critical at times when it comes to my favorite gaming genre but it comes from the desire to find the Holy Grail in city sims. I can honestly say, Cities Skylines is far and above, the best city building simulation ever made. Period. Colossal Order has come up with a recipe that ingenuously combines just the right amount of simplistic game design with a flavorful amount of challenging gameplay to create a masterpiece. Fans of City Building simulations will definitely not want to miss grabbing this game.

There is a very realistic feel to this game. Its not just about throwing out color-coded building zones, but more about true city management. Do things right and your populus will be greatful and steadily grow. Do things poorly and your city will clear out faster than a zombie apocalypse could make it happen. Numerous tools are at your disposal as expected with an interesting dynamic that truly brings the realism into the game. Cities can be carved up into different districts and each district can have its own set of policies and characteristics. Players even choose the names. But it doesn't just stop there. Players can give custom names to just about everything in the game including its citizens. 

Transportation and pollution will be key challenges as with any game of this type. Having experience with previous endeavors like the Cities in Motion series, Colossal Order has easily found a way to challenge players along these lines. Cars and trains, ships and planes. Cities Skylines has it all. The water simulation is spectacular as well. Placing your sewage disposal upstream, for example, could result in contaminating your citizens' water supply. Realistic flooding is another possible scenario. The maps included are gigantic and beautifully designed terrains that offer endless possibilites when planning your city and continued population growth unlocks the ability to expand to adjacent tiles on the map as well as making more buildings and options available (such as taking out loans). These options are tied in with overall success and not just simply from having enough funds available, a feature which definitely enhances the experience.

I could go on and on about all of the things I admire about this game. The graphics are solid but not overly done which allows for most systems to be able to run this game smoothly. The UI is easy to use and understand. The "Chirper" social media feature is a clever modern touch that keeps mayors abreast of public opinion and concerns. And, perhaps one of this game's best features is the inclusion of asset and map editting tools to allow the Steam Community to heavily mod this game in order to continue its growth and stability in the future while adding tons of extra content and replay value. 

In fact, about the only area I found lacking in this game is not having a variety of random events such as natural disasters. I cannot say with certainty why the developers chose not to include them and perhaps they will be added later as DLC since most Paradox Interactive games are known to offer quality additional content long after initial releases. The modding community could possibly offer them as well, since I predict the Steam Workshop will quickly fill up with a large variety of added content. Fires, floods, pollution, infrastructure and transportation issues are still more than enough to keep players challenged and fully engaged though, so overall its not really a major concern.

[h1][b]The Good:
========[/b][/h1]
[i]+  Solid graphics and rich detail
+  Realistic simulation elements
+  Challenging gameplay with various difficulty settings
+  Variety of buildings
+  Many customization options
+  Easy-to-use UI
+  Extremely high replay value
+  Mod-friendly with editting tools included
+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements
+  Pleasant audio/background music[/i]


[h1][b]The Bad:
======[/b][/h1]
[i]-  Lack of random events/natural disasters
-  Graphics could be more life-like
-  Terrain cannot be changed during actual gameplay[/i]

[h1][b]Final Thoughts:
===========[/b][/h1]
Cities Skylines is the best City Building simulation developed in a long time and quite possibly the best ever. Expect this game to continue to grow in popularity and become the new industry standard for games of this type. An amazing game with well-designed features integrated into it for such a small development team and a limited budget. Its definitely worth the price and I highly recommend this game to all fans of simulated strategy/cty building games.

This is a truncated version of this video review:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJb7C2OE9xM

If you’ve longed for another great city-builder like I have, or simply want to try one for the first time, I don’t hesitate at all in saying Cities Skylines is a superb choice.

Skylines is a proper old school city-builder. As a SimCity player since the 1989 original, I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on this thing. I’ve spent about 40 hours on it so far, so the question is: does it succeed in its goal of topping SimCity? Well, in a word, YES.

As is tradition, you start with a blank plot of land and a set of tools at your disposal. Generally the goal is to build a city, grow it as big as you like, and make sure it doesn’t die. You have a single highway connection to start out with, which acts as the first of many entrances to your city. Use the road tools to draw some roads, and you’ll see that you get groups of tiles extending from the side of them. These tiles can be filled with three types of zones: residential, commercial, and industrial, which will become homes, shops, and factories. Although more come into play later on, like high-density residential and commercial zones, as well as office zones, the central system of RCI demand is very much in play here. The more demand for a zone you have, the more people will move in to fill those zones and the more service buildings you'll require, so you’ll want to balance their placement with the other needs of the city. Beyond these basics, it’s totally up to you as to what’s next.

And thankfully you’re not limited to your initial map size. That starting plot of land is 2 square kilometers, but once you start reaching its borders, you have the option to buy more, up to 36 square miles worth (more if you mod the game with the excellent tile mod on Steam.) Although, sometimes the game gets a bit bogged down in ambiguities regarding its logic, mostly regarding traffic, services, and lack of UI information. But once I started to figure these systems out, the challenge in fixing them was hugely rewarding. Cities XXL and SimCity 5 were entirely too easy, and if you screwed those cities up, that was a real feat of ineptitude. Here, a doomed city can arise from something as simple as building an intersection instead of a multi-lane traffic circle, and that’s kind of awesome. But it doesn't feel cheap, it feels like something to learn from and perform better next time. There are also some included mods from the developers, which act as cheats and difficulty settings in lieu of more traditional menu options. And on top of that there's an incredible potential for user-made mods, with a full blessing from the developer to do so with the included Steam Workshop support.

Let me just say it: This is the game I’ve been craving since SimCity 4. My few complaints are just drops in a sea of truly satisfying gameplay. It’s the kind of game that I can play for so many hours at a time that when I leave, I start seeing zone layouts in my ceiling, and traffic patterns in my cereal. Just give me a pot of coffee and watch me while away dozens of hours creating the perfect balance of land value, city services, and mass transit systems and be completely content. It’s blissful, stressful, and compelling on a level that few games ever achieve for me anymore. There are so many details that I love, like the way you can paint zones with different brushes, the sweeping orchestral soundtrack, the guidelines that appear when placing roads, the fact you can flood your city if you dam a river improperly, the way any zone has buildings that fit into any plot shape, and on and on.

And it runs great too, even when surpassing 100,000 citizens, it still played solidly with minimal frame rate issues on both my desktop and laptop. Colossal Order pulled off a true colossal order here: they made a better SimCity than Maxis could (requiescat in pace.) And all this with a comparatively small budget, a team of a dozen or so people, and the Unity Engine. Just... wow. Cities Skylines is a total slap in the face to SimCity 5, and man is it a beautiful thing to behold. And the price... you get twice the game at half the price of its rival's launch price. Folks, this is what I like to call “doing it right”. They could’ve charged double and I still would recommend it, but wow. This is a top-notch game at a bargain launch price, and it makes me want to cry tears of joy.
Let me give you a history lesson.  
In 1989 Simcity was relased.  And it was great.
In 1994 SimCity 2000 was released and it was great.
In 1999 SC3k was released, and it was also, great.  (Are you seeing a theme here?)
In 2003, SimCity 4 was released, and it was perfection.

Now... it gets sad.
2007 brought us SimCity Socities, which was a thing.
And in 2013 brought us Sim City.  And Im sure you know what its miraid of problems was.

Now finally, 12 years after the last great city building game comes Skylines.  

By NOT trying to do all the interconnected and multiplayer garbage that sunk a decade of titles, Collossal Order has hit one out of the park.  Runs great on older machines, looks great, and has GREAT mod support.
In all honesty, while writing the introduction I was trying to think of a negative element that came up.  Still dont have one.

Buy this game.
Pros:

+ Game mechanics that you would expect from a city builder

+Built in modding tools

+Beautiful Graphics

+It's challanging (learning curve)

+No lag, and I have a computer that doesn't meet the requirements

+Lots of replayability

Cons:

-takes over your life

***

Specs that are below the minimum requirements:

2.8ghz (3.0 is the minimum)

Everything else is above the minimum required.
Cities: Skylines is a City Builder/Simulation game, and it’s fantastic.
Cities: Skylines absolutely destroys EA and Maxis’ 2013 effort, Sim City, in every conceivable way.  Where Maxis managed to somehow fail in a genre they pretty much invented, Colossal Games and Paradox Interactive have treated Maxis’ effort as a treatise on what not to do.

This is, without a doubt, the game Sim City 2013 should have been.

First up, the graphics. Skylines is very well optimized, with large detailed cities bustling along with no hiccups, and some nice options in the settings to fiddle with if you do experience any problems. The game looks great, with lots of detail. Buildings grow and “level up” as you watch, changing their value and appearance and attracting different types of people and businesses. You can easily identify different areas and specialties, as well as transport, power and sewerage systems by colour using the (mostly) intuitive UI. Clicking on people, houses and buildings will give you more details, and identifying problems (or successes) is made very easy.

The gameplay is where Skylines shines, however. You’ll be juggling residents needs and wants by ensuring access to clean water, power, efficient transportation, entertainment and medicine, to name just a few. You’ll have to control pollution, both physical and noise, crime and disease. There are a variety of ways to do this, how you go about it is up to you.

You’ll start by placing roads. Then zone areas off the roads into a category: Residential, Industrial, Retail and Office. Then set up a functioning power grid and clean water/waste water sewerage system. After that, it’s all about placing public services to attract more people, and expanding your city across the map. And what a map! You initially start on each map with a 2 square kilometre parcel of land in which to build, but can expand out over 8 such parcels out of 25 available per map. That said, it is trivial to mod out the limitation, and if your computer can handle it, you absolutely can build on the entire map. As a bonus, if you don’t like any of the premade maps the game ships with, you can easily use the in-game map editor to create (or recreate!) your own map to play on. There is even an asset editor too, so you can create and modify the in game assets to your preferences.

The game systems make sense, and work how you’d expect them to. This is a simulation game, after all! After you’ve finished zoning your city, you can then create districts, which allow you to apply policies city wide or just to select areas. Make the CBD have compulsory smoke detectors and free public transport, while giving the poor and destitute section of town a rebate on green energy. Ban heavy vehicles from residential areas to lower noise and decongest traffic!

Industries will make you money, but require careful planning. Take advantage of natural oil reserves, mine ore, farm, cut down your forests or simply go for “Generic”, where you’ll be making random stuff. The finance and taxation system is easily understood and superb. 

The game models traffic behaviour very well and in fact figuring out a way to manage high density traffic is one of the hardest aspects of playing Skylines. To that end, you’re given plenty of options, such as numerous road types, public transport, cargo ships, trains and aeroplanes.

Surprisingly, the game has an incredibly effective water simulation too; Dams will burst and water flows realistically throughout the map, and pollution will be carried downstream with currents.

The icing on the cake for Cities: Skylines is the fact that Skylines is 100% mod friendly, with integrated Steam Workshop support. People have already uploaded thousands of custom maps and assets to the workshop, as well as gameplay tweaks and it’s pretty safe to say that if you find something wrong with the game that you think could be better, there is a very good chance that there is already a mod for it on the workshop.

Now you’ve heard me gush over how great this game is, what are the cons?

The game doesn’t auto-save! This is a real pain if you mess up. But, there is a mod for that.

There is no day/night cycle, which would have been nice. But, there is a mod for that.

The camera doesn’t let me go low enough to get a good look of my city streets up close. But, there is a mod for that. There is another one that enables a First Person View from and person you click on in the street!

Not a lot of maps to choose to play on. But, the workshop has hundreds available, downloaded and added to the available maps with a single click.

There is even a mod that allows you and a friend to explore your cities in First Person online, using the in game people as avatars. Why? Who knows! But it’s possible!


In conclusion, if you like city builders or simulation games, you cannot go wrong with Cities: Skylines. It is everything you could want out of this genre.

Sim City, eat your heart out.
Without a doubt one of the best City Builders of all time. The price is so reasonable for the amount of quality content you get both from the default game and from all the modders on the Steam workshop. I'm so looking forward to what new things will be released in the future for this game. The Developers also listen to their customers and have been adding more modding tools for us to use to create new assets for players. Thanks CO!
So I made my first city, getting it from zero to eight thousand when I finally unlocked dams. At this point I was doing terrible with electricity, because I really didn't want to make many coal plants, so the second I saw Dams unlocked I saved to make one. I found a great spot that could solve my energy needs forever, and placed the dam. As I clicked I knew I made a terrible mistake. I made the dam directly beside the densest part of my Residential District. Water poured over the side of the dam and into the city, drowning my population and creating abandoned buildings. When the water finally calmed down it was in the form of a lake in the center of the city, halfway in residential, halfway in commercial. In an attempt to fix this I started pumping the water out (which actually seems to have worked), but I put the output in a place where it flowed into both of my main water pumps. And while I was only pumping plain water out of my city, the game counted it as waste water. I was feeding my citizens fresh water poop. So while water was killing the center of my city, poop water was killing the rest. The surge of water also managed to destroy my garbage collection, so I got this terrible mix of overflowing rivers, overflowing garbage, and overflowing sickness.

All in all an absolutely hilarious experiance. Great game.
Things I can do in Cities: Skylines that I couldn't do in SimCity:

- Play without an internet connection
- Edit terrain in a nice map editor
- Play without logging into Origin
- Actually have simulated people whose actions make sense
- Manage traffic properly
- Have fun

Graphics are beautifal and enhanced by mods, lots of city management features, real simulation and MOD SUPPORT. But alas no multiplayer :/ .
- Modding from day one
- Every citizen simulated
- Agent system works on launch
- No EXTERNAL DRM (You know, except for Steam)
- No always online
- No forced multiplayer aspect
- Not published by EA
- Published by Paradox
- Better than SimCity
- Half the price then SimCity when you compare them at launch price
- Actually fun

See EA? This is how you make a city builder.

RIP Maxis Emeryville, but don't worry, the genre is in safe hands. Colossal Order's hands.
Let's start with this: it is an amazing city building game. It's the best in generations. BUT, like any other game, it has it's downfalls too.


MAP SIZE: 10/10
The city size is HUGE. At first you start out in a 2kmx2km area, but you can expand to a total of 9 of them, for a 18x18km area or 324 km or 201 mi area. Another pluside is that there are already mods to expand your city size to a total of 25 tiles, for a 50x50 km area, 2500 km, or 1553 mi area. The size of this doesn't make your computer lag, either, unless you don't meet the minimum requirements for the game.

AI: 7/10
They all have diverse personalities, and you can explore the lives of each of them. The only problem is the traffic. It's terrible: If there all 6 lanes available, they will all go in one lane. Genius.

INTERFACE: 9/10
The interface is great. It is just a little cluttered.

HOW IT RUNS: 10/10
It runs extremley smooth and only starts to lag when you have HUGE cities. For an example, watch this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVoP1Um95Sg&list=UUZYqx1ak0C-YKhUQY6QtxDQ

THINGS TO DO: 9/10
There is a LOT to do, from perfecting neighborhoods to fixing water pipes. The only reason I knocked 1 point off is because there are no disasters, which in my opinion is something required for a city building game.

DIVERSITY: 9/10
The only reason it is 9/10 is because the building colors are almost identical and painted-looking. Despite this, you can model your own buildings :)

DIFFICULTY: (not how hard the game is) 9/10
The only reason it is difficult is when you get to huge cities it becomes literally difficult with everything in your face all at once.

GRAPHICS: (for the average graphics of the time of the release date) 9/10
They are amazing. I've seen better, but it is still great. It has it's own style.

CLUTTER: 8/10
Ugh, when your in a city trying to build, pop ups everywhere makes it hard to work..

PRICE: 10/10
For this great of a game, it is very cheap at the time of it's release.

OVERALL SCORE:
90% To Perfect
Would I recommend this? Yes!
Finally, the city builder everyone was expecting, and still wanted.

+ Devs who listen and care
+ Map sizes
+ Clean graphics
+ Chirpy
+ Insane modding community
+ No seriously, the workshop for this game is bat shit crazy
+ I just flew a plane through my city. These mods are ridiculous.
 
- No day/night cycle or online mutiplayer [EDIT: After Dark day/night cycle added for FREE]
- ... who cares though, the rest of the game is more than enough and then some

I'd also like to mention.... R.I.P. Maxis. 

There should be an in-game memorial park in their honor for Cims to pay homage to, and an EA park in which homeless vagrants can do what homeless vagrants do.

This is how you give a gaming community what it wants, and how you're paid in return - by asking what it wants and listening to what it asks for. Not telling it what it needs instead.

Take notes, EA.

10/10
Hi. I'm an asset creator for this game, which is to say I make custom Workshop content so people can have something interesting and different to look at in their cities. I am not the best asset creator for this game - but I really love doing it. 

If Cities:Skylines didn't exist, I wouldn't have bothered to learn how to create 3D game assets and models, texture said models, nor would I have met some fantastic people who share the same interest. I've always loved city builders, all the way back since SimCity on the SNES - and this one really scratches that itch. The enthusiasm and diversity of this community can not be understated. As a Canadian, I've met people from the U.K., Kazakhstan, Russia, France, Japan, the U.S. - and some of my fellow countrymen - and all have shared that enthusiasm. In terms of a competent and accommodating community, Cities:Skylines is hard to beat.

As a city builder, it's competent. It is better than the latest SimCity (2013), which is part of the reason why this game did so well. But it's not without its flaws. The thing is, though, like all cult classic games, you won't have a reason to complain about anything until you're deep enough in to call yourself a fan.

The base game is worth the price of admission outside of a sale. You should experience it if you have any interest in city builders. As it is a Paradox published title, there is a considerable amount of DLC, which some, sometimes, including myself, find disagreeable. My recommendation here is to purchase the After Dark and Mass Transit DLCs at any cost and go for the Snowfall, Natural Disasters and Green Cities when you can get them at a good price. All DLCs add something worthwhile to the game - but After Dark and Mass Transit, to me, were the most beneficial to gameplay.

Also, if you decide to purchase - ensure you have a decent supply of RAM before loading up on custom content. The minimum requirement for the game is 4gb - but I would recommend 8 (16 or more, if you can afford it. It's a Unity thing.).

The grassroots nature of Cities:Skylines is its greatest virtue. It's one of those few striking games that really exemplifies 'We, the people.' It is so many things to such a diverse crowd.

So, if you're a builder type, and you're hedging on it, you have my recommendation.
You know a game is good when you wake up in the morning, turn on your PC, and play it until you sleep at night, skipping brushing your teeth, bathing, and even eating.

For me, this is one of those games.
Things I can do in Cities: Skylines that I couldn't do in SimCity (5)

- Play without an internet connection
- Name my city something rude like PantyFlash
- Edit terrain in a nice map editor
- Play without logging into Origin...
- Actually have simulated people whose actions make sense
*** Every person has their own name and a constant house where they live ***
- Manage traffic properly
- Have fun

I have been a big SimCity fan for many years. I've collected the games and have tried my best to stay loyal to the brand because most SimCity games brought me many hours of gameplay and joy. When SimCity Societies came out, I received it for free with another game I had purchased. I must admit... it was one of the weakest SimCity games I had played but I still put some time into it because I appreciated that the Maxis team had tried something different.

Then SimCity (5) happened... I was one of those suckers that actually went out and bought a hard copy of the game the day it released. Heck I had been waiting for about 10 years and when I spent what is roughly $45 dollars I thought it was worth it because this is SimCity! I played the game for about a week and then went played SimCity 2000 instead. Yes that's right, I would rather play a game made in 1994 than one made in 2013. And when SimCity came out with an expansion pack for it a few months after release, I was done. Done with SimCity. A game that I have played and loved my entire life. The first PC game I owned other than solitaire and that crazy pinball game that came with Microsoft =.=.

So long live Cities: Skylines. Long live Collosal Order.

[b]PS: Found a link earlier this week about Maxis and EA. Apparently EA is closing Maxis down. Give it a read. http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2015/03/04/its-a-sim-ea-closes-simssimcity-developer-maxis/ [/b] What do you guys think about this? Feel free to comment.

Also please keep in mind that the comments made on SimCity 5 are based on my experience with the game when it originally released and not patches and ammendments that have been made to the game since then.
Full Video Review:  http://youtu.be/OSazQTA7PSo

Pros
[b]++Very accessible to new players, but has enough depth to satisfy veterans of the genre[/b]
[b]++Each citizen has a real life, simulated 24/7 to the point where you can follow everyone around to find exactly where they live and where they work. [/b]
+Huge cities with 36 square kilometer area for building, expandable through mods to 100 square kilometers 
+Runs well on my GTX 770 and i5 3.8ghz CPU on max settings
+Day 1 modding and Steam works integration
+Custom ingame asset and map editors

Cons
[b]--No day or night cycle, meaning no rush hours or changes in traffic patterns[/b]
-Lack of depth in a few of the systems (wind and crime specifically)
-Dams are buggy, can cause massive unnatural flooding if they stop working correctly. 
-Bigger cities can reduce performance 
-Building styles are repetitive, often times 3 or more of the same store or house end up being built next to each other

If you like city builders, this is honestly the best one to come out in years. Cities: Skylines allows you to easily build huge cities without restriction that truly feel alive with the real time simulation of ALL the citizens. Rename and customize everything, even custom buildings and maps can be created in the in game editors included. And with a very fair $30 price tag, there is honestly no reason outside of a few minor bugs to not play Cities: Skylines.
My first city went bankrupt, the second was washed away by flood (don't ask), third drowned in sewage, my fourth and current city (as of this writing) is doing fine but city layout is horrible - traffic jams everywhere.

This game refuses to hold my hand, as it should. Played for 12 hours straight - reluctant to leave my computer to shower, eat and go to the bathroom. Basic needs are for losers.
I'm terrible at city-building games. JUST TERRIBLE. You know the "city advisor" features in most games of this type? They are ALWAYS unhappy with me. "What, are you an idiot?" they say.

Okay, so I'm not a strategic thinker, so I play city-building games like a painter with a brush, or like Tetris without the disappearing blocks. I think zero moves ahead. I can't think ahead. I'm terrible at chess, too. I just like to build things and watch them evolve, and then tear them down again.

Why does this matter in a review of Cities: Skylines? It matters because the game lets me play this way and doesn't penalize me. I can ignore city advisors, or the little twitter feed at the top of the page. I can build a sprawling eco-friendly suburbia or a toxic metropolitan nightmare, and it just lets me do it. Some people bemoan the lack of complex city-building features in this game--and it's true they're adding more all the time--but I celebrate that Colossal Order has realized that people like me exist.

The game requires absurdly high specs to run smoothly. One day I hope to upgrade my PC so I can dump sewer water into Shady Acres without an inferiority complex to dampen my malevolent glee.
It is a great game but has one huge flaw.
The DLC's. They are overpriced and two of the more costly DLC's should be in the base game.
Pros
- Good gameplay
- Fun tax system
- a good budget system
- no lag until later stages of game
- good way of finding out what your people need

Cons
- Bad DLC prices
- foundation is in the DLC's

The game is worth the price but the DLC's are bad in price and content for the price they give
Really cool city builder/simulation. Biggest downside is the shear amount of content locked behind a DLC paywall. Some of the DLC's like Natural Disasters should've been included with the base game.
TLDR; Buy this game if you enjoy the genre and felt like SC5 was a piece of crap.

PROS:
-Day one MOD SUPPORT! Amazing!
-No EA
-No Always online bullshit
-No Origin
-Big city limits (suck it SC5)
-Graphics
-Very detailed city simulation, down to individual citizens
-Water simulation!
-Finnish game studio
-Friend works in the company.
-No EA

CONS:
-Public transportation lines are difficult to edit afterwards, when you got many of them and some overlapping. Would be very helpful to be able to isolate them for easier editing.
-Tree placing should be a brush ( There's a nice mod that fixes this )
-No autosaving ( There's a mod that fixes this )
-No disasters
-No time of day, different weather effects and seasons.

  [td][h1]8[/h1][/td]
  [td]The design in Skylines is certainly well thought out. A balance between looking good, and performing well. While not top of the line graphics, Skylines found a sweet medium between realism and cartoony that actually works rather well. It's not distracting in any way, and you wouldn't really notice until you zoomed in close to individual cars and people. The city feels alive and bustling, and the game still performs well at large simulation levels. The interface is very, very well thought out, along with each of the overlays. It is clear they are all heavily inspired by Sim City (the good ones), which isn't a bad thing. Why fix what isn't broke? [/td]

  [td][h1]9.5[/h1][/td]
  [td]This is what city-builders have been waiting for, for a long time. Ever since Sim City 4, city building games have either performed poorly, or massively under-delivered gameplay wise. Skylines has come onto the field full force, and delivers a polished, seamless world to build in, with a gigantic area to boot. Manage your water lines, power, trash, health care, leisure, and more. Of particular note are the public transit routes, refined by the former Cities in Motion games. Also of mention is the small, but wonderful ability to create districts which allow you to section out portions of your city and assign each of them unique names and policies (no high-rises, less water use, etc). Skylines took plenty of notes from the old city builder games we all loved, and refined the experience into something absolutely wonderful. They've even included a mode to allow you to play with unlimited money, and everything unlocked, so you can build without worry and create the city you've always dreamed of! The only minor frustrations that have emerged are some struggles with boats and routes for roads, but that could be my lack of patience for getting down into the nitty-gritty details of layout.[/td]

  [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]

  [td]If you have been waiting for a worthy successor to Sim City 4, you have just found it. With free content updates down the road, Steam Workshop support, and developer's that listen to their audience, Cities: Skylines has everything good going for it, and my does it sing its song well. From the refined interface, to the focus upon you having control over your city, to the sheer size of the cities you can create; Cities: Skylines delivers on every front, and is exactly the city-builder game you hoped it would be. Though it isn't revolutionary in any of its gameplay elements, it has risen to the challenge that was so long failed, and now carries the torch of the city-building genre. Highly recommended, now get out there and build the city you've always dreamed of, and be sure to stop by the Steam Workshop for some neat mods! [/td]

[b]Q: What I think of this game?[/b]

A: Best city builder game I played... ever... period

[b]Q: What I don’t like about it?[/b]

A: Traffic does need to be fine tuned, and I feel mods are necessary to balance the game, but it's very tedious...

[b]Q: What about user generated content?[/b]

A: Workshop community has been very impressive, adding so many cool things to the game. 

I am at a point where I feel I am missing out on amazing mods and content, because there are so many to choose from, and I can't invest the time to try them all. 

But how can you really complain from having too much choice, so forget I just said that...

[b]Q: Does it worth the price?[/b]

A: Price might seem a bit steep to some, but for any fan of city builder games, you'll get your money's worth in the first week... and probably lose a bit of grasp on reality at the same time. 

Bottom line, you will get a lot more then what you pay for, so why wait?

[b]Q: What I would love to see added to the game?[/b]

A: I would like to see some scenarios of some kind being added. 

Milestones are great, and sandbox opens so many possibilities... yet still, I would like to have the option of being guided or limited to specific objectives.

It would help me understand some parts of the game better, and bring my game to another level.

[b]Q: What are my advices when playing the game?[/b]

A: The game expects you to be a pro at this; you'll have to make a lot of mistakes before you find your way.

It's easy to "cheat" the game, but it will not make it more fun. 

- Watch tutorials to get some ideas 
- Use mods with caution, they can improve the game, but can also break it... 
- Help rating user generated content, rating takes 5 seconds and creators should get recognition for their work
- Make suggestions, Colossal Order and Paradox are listening to the feedback and are not wasting any time

[b]Q: What would I like to say to Paradox and Colossal Order’s team?[/b]

A: You have given me what I was waiting for! THANK YOU! 

But you have also stolen 100 hours of my life already... Are you proud?     I am sure you are ;) 

You’ve set new standards in the way a game should be delivered to the community and updated based on user feedback, and all gamers will benefit from your work. 

Kudos to everyone!!!

[b]Q: Where am I going?[/b]

A: Sorry, I have a city to build... goodbye!
Colossal order releases a city-building simulator. Millions of copies sold. A couple of months later developer makes an announcement:"We are sorry, that we didn't include tunnels and European buildings in the initial release of the game. Here, take them for free".
They should add multiplayer so freinds can work on one city at the same time and share their money to get their city growing good and have everything they work on appear the pther persons screen with no delay

[b][i]Cities: Skylines[/i][/b] is a city building simulator. Build a city from the grounds up, managing the budget and city services for a population that is increasingly demanding as it grows. This review takes into account the [i]After Dark[/i] DLC (will update review as I acquire and play with further DLCs).

[b]Pros[/b]: The game looks great with intricate models and gorgeous night-time lighting effects. The tutorial is built into the game with help cards that explain each game concepts when accessing them for the first time. These concepts are gradually introduced upon reaching certain population thresholds, which makes sense: a 1000-citizen town doesn't need a university or a subway line, so you don't get city approval to build these until the population mendates it. [i]Colossal Order[/i]'s experience with [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/73010/]Cities in Motion[/url][/i] shines through the complex, but not complicated, public transport system, down to bus routes, cab depots and international airports. City budget is simple with scroll-bars for taxes and service expense, and various city-wide or district-specific policies ranging from Smoking Ban for a better city health to Legalized Marijuana for bonus tourism. Money is inflated just well enough, as either something's wrong with your city and you're losing a lot of money, or you fixed what's wrong and you're making a lot of money, preventing you from spending an eternity waiting for your money to go up a few dollars at a time (unlike some other city builder I know) or needing to change the game speed in an attempt to skip the wait. Statistics and graph tools are impeccable, you just pick category from the graphs menu or a building from your build menu, and you get stats, capacity, street coverage and building needs right in the city view.

[b]Cons[/b]: You are limited to a starting map and may gradually purchase more land, and while the concept makes sense in tycoon-style games, you can unlock most land expansions pretty early and their cost is pretty low, so it feels like a cheap way to force you into starting at a particular location when you wish you could start you city elsewhere on the map. There are some weird oversights in the graphics, such as large ships that literally pass through bridges, or trees that grew under water (leaves and all). Building long roads or pipes in a straight line is also sketchy: I regularly had roads built in parallel still have the space between them shrink over distance, or have the hardest time getting both directions of a highway aligned in curves. I mean, I'm all for it when it comes to not being locked into an isometric grid, but it should allow you to build straight when you want to. Ironically, buildings and land tiles, which you may want to customize, actually ARE locked in a grid along the road. Even with a dozen alternate routes, every single car (including emergency vehicules) use the shortest road regardless on traffic jams, a problem that only gets worst as the city grows.

[b]Verdict[/b]: ★★★★★ - Play this. Now.

The Cons may appear lengthy, but it's only because these were minor gripes that required explanation to even grasp why they are gripes. [i]Cities: Skylines[/i] is the best city builder out there, bringing everything that was fun about [i][url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/24780/]SimCity 4 – Deluxe Edition[/url][/i], equaling or surpassing most innovations [i]SimCity "5"[/i] brought, and adding so much of its own. If you like city simulators at all, this one is a must have. I can't wait to experience the [i]Snowfall[/i] DLC's new weather conditions and city services, as well as the upcoming [i]Natural Disasters[/i] DLC that'll give it the only things left SimFans can still brag about.

[quote][b]P.S.[/b]: I haven't mentioned the Mods available through the Steam Workshop, but I just have to point out [url=http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961632157/myworkshopfiles/?appid=255710][i]Bryan Shannon[/i][/url], a former Maxis artist who does professional-quality building Mods for [i]Cities: Skylines[/i].

Hi guys! This is Pablo, from SimNation.

Cities: Skylines goes back to the core City Builder experience of SimCity 2000, 3000, 4... and improves on it.

Simulation is epic. Each citizen is simulated, with own age, workplace, home, household, education level and happines. They can even own cars. And all of this is persistent. All of them are living in your city until the day they die out of sickness or when their time comes.
Traffic and Public transportation is properly executed as well. Heck, even water is simulated with the Fluid simulation. I think we all have seen the dams and the poop flowing by a river at the expected speed and direction.

The economic system is awesome. RCI is meaningful. Commerces import goods from the exterior, or local industries if available. Citizens must purchase different kind of goods to be happy. And all of this is executed, and you can get down to street level and see it for yourself.

Building a city on Cities: Skylines is this long, epic journey, where you will be laying out the city infrastructure through proper city planning and engineering (the game will punish you for not making road access or dispose your sewage properly), dealing with Noise Pollution, dead body collection, and all with the right level of micro management to make you feel you are in charge. From laying down the routes of buses or metros, to defining Districts and setting unique Policies to change the way it behaves, or help a sector get back on it's feet by lowering taxes or making public transportation free.

Despite the lack of polishing of many aspects of the game, from user feedback, to user interface and lack of content variety (chirps, buildings, billboards), you are not going to focus too hard on it because of all the other things the game gets right.

If you like city builders, this is hands down a safe purchase. A game that will most likely be supported for years, with an insanely amount of Mods and great deal of free patches to come, which will hopefully fix those rough edges from day 1.
This game is comparable to Simcity 4 but with better graphics and gameplay. A whole lot better when compared to the latest simcity which is plagued with many problems such as map size and DRM.

Pros:

- Realistic water simulation; if you build your water intake down the river and the waste output up the river, you're gonna feed your citizens with poop water. And dams will alter the flow of the river

- Noise pollution is taken into consideration (Can be caused by traffic, windmills, industries etc.). 

- District zoning (allows you to micro-manage your city easily). Policies can be introduced only to the specific districts. For example, in district 1 it is legal to use recreational drugs while in district 2 it is illegal.

- Easily accesable info view where you can see the stats of your city, such as education, crimes, and so on.

- Natural resource exploitation for more income.

- Detailed public transportation systems which allows you to plan the routes.

- Very easy to learn especially if you have played city building games such as Simcity before.

- You are able to see the complaints of your citizens in a notification box above the screen which functions like twitter. This allows you to pinpoint and correct problems quickly.

- Very big map sizes allows you to build metropolitan cities.

- Limited service buildings are available at first but becomes available as your city grows (makes it easy for new players to learn)

Cons:

- Road mapping can get wonky sometimes and you end up building roads that are slanted. This kinda irritate the OCD side of me.

- The unavailability of service buildings early in the game means that it is harder to plan your city early on. And you might have to sacrifice a couple of houses to accomodate the buildings.


I will continue to update my review as I put more hours into this game. Feel free to comment on your opinions.
Saw this game on the front page, never knew about it. 

As of writing this review, I've only played for six hours and I've already restarted four times because the streets weren't straight enough and I went into debt rebuilding them. 

PROS:
No EA.
No EA Origin.
Did I mention no EA involved?
Also no EA.

-New land purchasing now gives players a choice of when and where to expand, not just confining them to a small square of limited development.
-Road tools give players much more freedom to create and weave around the city, upgrading also made easy as well. (Simcity 2013's upgrade roads had an idea going but you had to level an entire street to get anywhere, completely negating the point)
-Being able to relocate a civil building for much cheaper than destroying removes the hassle of trying to redo roads around a public service due to a single building.
-Still has well-working fluid and sewage dynamics, taking what SimCity 5 attempted with their pollution system and actually turning it into something good.
-Parks affect the lives of citizens without taking ungodly amounts of space, and much like a real park one large park that is easily accessible more than a few hundred small parks all around the city wasting space. (cough cough SimCity 2013)
-Even though the water dynamics are a little rough as of right now, the game still gives an option for a hydroelectric dam; a feat previously impossible in SimCity 2013 and unimaginably difficult in SimCity 4.

The only thing I don't like about this game so far?

@Developers #The #twitter-like #announcements #and #the #constant #usage #of #hashtags (I get the point but I feel like my city is composed of preteens.)

So far and still hours later, 10/10.

**EDIT 5/23/2015**
I've found that the developers of the game themselves are very active and receptive in their own community at r/citiesskylines and actually listen to their users.
Developers also cranked out FREE and well-done DLC, like it's supposed to be.
Game still kicks ass!
What. A. Game.
If you were like me and, after hearing the negativity around SimCity 2013, and played the early SimCities with glee, then it is likely you were hunting out a modern city builder with serious credentials. Cities: Skylines is just that.
Before I talk about Pros and Cons, I will just say this game gets a solid 8.5/10 and despite a pretty stiff £22 asking price, is worth every penny.
PROS
Detailed and involving tax and economy features
Variety of buildings and themes
All major aspects of city builders and of just real life are covered: health, crime, traffic, fire etc.
Good road building mechanics
Water-based buildings that CAN ACTUALLY BE PLACED (ahem SimCity 2004 ahem)
Lovely graphics
Efficient and effective interface
Slow paced, relaxing gameplay
Traffic that actually requires thought and effort
Good learning curve
Mod support
CONS
Screw you, bus line creator
Rivers can flood through terrain, ruining cities you once though safe from water damage
Beach?
Some mods seem for me to not work, though whether this is C:S's or the modder's fault I'm not sure
Sometimes, placing of large buildings like the largest hospital, is tricky as it complains stuff is in the way when it isn't (UPDATE - have realised that this may partially be down to the underground power cables mod i have getting in the way of building, Anarchy mod fixes this)

Overall, a great game and a definite recommedation.
I like this. 

Pros:
+No EA.
+Good performance.
+No "Always online" bullshit.
+Mod support.
+Launch price is like 50-60% of normal full game price on launch.
+Game takes up little HardDrive space (About 2-4 GB's). 
+Large build space (Composed of 2x2Km squares that can be unlocked, I have 8 at the moment, not sure of limit). (+mods to increase it further, at cost of performance) 
+A few unique mechanics (Like Districts), as well as good mechanics you'd expect.

Cons:
-Easy.
-Lack of endgame content.
-Looks like a Sim City clone. (Yet the "clone" is >2 times better...)

TL;DR: Good. Get.
Cities Skylines looks to bring back the classic city building genre to it's roots. Avoiding the mistakes made by EAs most recent Sim City release, Skylines does without an always online connection, supports large building areas and user created mods.

And while avoiding these pitfalls, Collosal Order and Paradox have also made a very addictive and entertaining game.  You can easily lose hours making sure your bus routes are optimized and your fire departments can get to that shack down the road that keeps burning down.

The UI is clear and easy to navigate, building roads and designating zones for construction is simple, yet requires some careful planning if you want to make the "best" city possible. There are many tools and overlays available for viewing crime, water quality, power consumption, etc. Economy isn't overtly deep, simple sliders for taxes, and options for different policies.  For those wanting to go deeper, you can rename every citizen, vehicle, building, create districts, individually manage them, alter bus routes, and plenty more for the mayor that wants to really get down to street level.

Planning traffic routes is of prime importance in this game. Industry needs to move products, emergency services need to get to calls, and dead people need to be removed from their homes. More so than pretty much anything, you need to keep your eye on this. This isn't surprsing given the developer's history with Cities in Motion (despite being a Paradox game with a similiar name, this isn't part of the Cities XL series). 

Graphics look good for the genre (don't expect GTA V detailed cities), and everything is running smooth for me at a population of 45k as of this writing. The sounds are what you'd expect, nothing really stands out, and it's not annoying, fairly average. 

While the variety of options in the game is plenty, there are still some things I'm sure some people will miss from other city building games. No day or night cycle kind of spoiled my desire to see my city lit up at night. There could be a bit more variety in buildings, and public services (libraries, museums, prisons, zoos and some other notable buildings all appear to be absent). I'm sure modders will fill in this gap given some time, but I wouldn't mind paying for a hefty expansion if they decided to release more content in the future.

[h1][b]Bottom Line[/b][/h1]
8/10 Cities: Skylines is definitely the best city-builder game I have ever played but not without flaws, this game falls into a familiar routine of there being few optimal ways to run a town. The depth of this game is like no other city-builder though, it's just great, from following each citizen about their daily routine to using mods to take away all stoplights allowing your citizens to drive with reckless abondon this game definitely has many hours of gameplay to offer the casual gamer. I highly recommend grabbing this game, especially on sale.
This is the game awaited by the city building community for 12 years, a proper, full 3D successor to SimCity 4. It is incredibly fun, insanely addictive and somewhat challenging, although it has some minor drawbacks.

Pros:
+ It is so addictive I spent 36 hours playing it in the first three days after I got it
+ Transportation system is very detailed, and agent-based simulation works very nicely with it
+ Zoning works very nicely with free-form roads
+ The available territory is quite big - up to 36 square kilometers in base game (9 tiles), up to 100 square kilometers with a simple mod (25 tiles) and whopping 324 (!) square kilometers with the less stable 81 tile enabler
+ Unique and fully working fluid dynamics system
+ Districts and policies allow for fine control over your city
+ Globally unlocked buildings help to vary playstyle in different cities - from building an eco-friendly utopia with lots of parks and low taxes to an industrial hellhole full of illness and crime
+ Modding is quite encouraged - the community is very active and the tools are easy to use; by now there are hundreds of great mods and assets avalable on the Workshop
+ Dev team keeps in touch with the community and pays a lot of attention to the feedback
+ Free patches significantly improve the game, introducing great features like tunnels, European themed buildings, day-night cycle, in-game terraforming, canals and quays, increased object limits and improved mod tools

Cons:
- It's not very challenging past the first 10k - the biggest hurdles left are traffic and congestion (there are numerous mods rebalancing the game to be harder more realistic, but I can't vouch for their quality)
- The amount of assets included in the base game is relatively small (but bigger than on release), so you'll see a lot of repetition (although it is remedied by mods and community-created assets, you have to keep an eye on RAM and VRAM consumption)
- Day/night cycle doesn't really make much of a difference in vanilla gameplay (again, there's an excellent mod which overhauls the mechanic - Rush Hour)

All in all, Cities: Skylines is an amazing game that's certainly worth a purchase, especially with its low price. But you may not enjoy it as much if you are not a fan of the genre.
I started with city builders way back in 1996, with SimCity 2000, beginning the construction of my "capital of capitals" - I was nine, I nerded out, made it a capital of an empire I created for myself, heh. For the permanently angled view, the constant reticulation of splines, and the occasional metal monster blowing up my forests of arcologies and massacring millions of my citizens as a result, there was enough to it to make the imagination to go wild. SC3K (and 3K Unlimited/World Edition) was the same basic idea with a lot more detail, and SC4 allowed me to build bigger and bigger (Rush Hour was a neat touch too, because you could actually into the streets - not quite like Streets of SimCity, but close enough). Even Societies, which gets a bad rap because it's not Maxis - among other reasons - worked out great - perhaps even better, as your decisions on the society effected the decor quite nicely. (I tended to build Authoritarian cities, heh heh.)

Then came SimCity 2013, and it seemed like a good idea to start. Except for the constant online feature, the DRM controversies, so on...and the fact that the city sizes were fixed, as opposed to the variously-sized tiles made available in SC4. It basically turned into another typical EA game - "buy more of this, it will enhance the experience". I was disappointed...Cities of Tomorrow was an interesting touch, but not enough to keep me going.

Then I heard about Cities: Skylines. A number of people suggested the similar-yet-unrelated Cities XL (and various sequels) to me in lieu of SC '13, and when this came out, some pointed me here. I got it during the last sale about a month ago, and began building a new incarnation of my capital of capitals...and for the first time in twenty years, it felt like a real city, with real needs. I was used to the basic stuff, mainstays of most city-builders of this type - needs power, water, garbage disposal, police, so on - but in my first playthrough, I looked in the healthcare tab and went, "Wait...cemeteries? You have DEATHCARE in this game?" Which was kinda funny to me, as in real life, I like to explore historic cemeteries...the thought never occurred to me that maybe there could be historical cemeteries in my own cities!

The unique buildings and monuments are also a nice touch, because they're functional as well as decorative (I have them all except for the fusion plant, I need the observatory). The weather is also nice; I will have to get the Snowfall pack to see how well I can build in the snow...if it's anything like New England winter, probably not too well!

While there is still a size limit (barring the use of mods) for your city, it's a lot larger than in SC '13, and also has a lot more flexibility than SC '13...or any other type of game like this I've played, for that matter. And the realistic details allowed me to fool my friends and family; my brother had actually thought a screencap of my city was a photograph of a real city.

In short: Loads of fun, and it's induced me to commit heresy against the Church of SimCity by building here...any fans of the golden oldies, please don't burn me at the stake.
1. ok ok.. one more block, and i stop.
2. ok ok.. i need to reach 10.000 population before go to sleep.
3. ok ok.. i need sort out this traffic jam first before go to sleep.
4. ok ok.. this is my last hour playing this game
5. ok ok.. oh sh1t.. its 2 am already.. 
i came late for my work. finished early , go home, repeat step 1 to 5 ( and i forget to eat my dinner)
well done paradox for ruining my life .

[h1]This is the City Builder of my Dreams![/h1]

[b]If you're unsure if you want this game because other City Builders put you off...
Trust me, I've played them all and this one is by far the best![/b]

[h1]Things I really like:[/h1]
- Buying surrounding land, the starter map isn't overwhelming.
- Map / Item Editors... - Customisation makes any game better.
- The launch price isn't greedy...
- The graphics are beautiful and the game is amazingly optimised!
- Little animations such as ambulances, fire engines etc. add that character to the game.
- Workshop support!.. The developers fully support Modders! :D
- Right-Hand Drive option - This makes it more realistic to me...

[h1]Things I don't like:[/h1]
- The roads are good but they can be a little awkward to place every so often.
- Placing pipelines.. I rather this just be auto-added under streets
- The Unlock system is good but things like Taxes or Public Transport shouldn't be Locked.
- Doesn't seem to work on triple monitors... The game loads but you can't click "Continue" or "New".

[i]I'd Recommend this game to anyone who Enjoys Building games or Simulators. 10/10
There's a few really minor issues but overall this is the best game of its sub-genre.[/i]

[b]Another game that makes me happy to own a Computer![/b]
My people complained because taxes were too high, so I placed the water pumping station right next to the water drain pipe so they were forced to drink their own urine and feces. Within minutes, 97% of the water was contaminated with their own poop and hospitals began to flood with sick people. I couldn't let that happen, so I bulldozed every medical clinic and hospital and replaced them with cemetaries so the citizens knew exactly what their future looked like. While more and more people got sick, the population continued to decrease by the thousands. It took no more than fifteen minutes before every citizen was dead. Every citizen except for one. While everyone else was in bed waiting to die, there was one lone garbage truck driver who was determined to do his duty to his country. He pushed through the sickness and feces and continued to collect trash from the empty houses. That man operating the garbage truck is a true hero. Even through the apocalypse, he continued to fight for this country and show the world he is truly the greatest garbage truck driver that ever lived. Shortly after, he drowned in his own shit. RIP in peace Squidney Saxton, garbage man, 2015-2015.

On the bright side, my traffic problem went away.

One of my residents started spouting some bourgeois shit about our region's farming industry via the in-game Twitter feed.

Fortunately, the game was able to immediately show me their whereabouts so I bulldozed their fucking home and built a cow pasture on it. 

Five stars.

Whats good -
HUGE Playable area versus Simcity 2013
Workshop = Endless modability 
Even without buying the DLC, you still get some stuff every DLC release

What's not so good -
Resource hog ; you need a NASA computer to run this on all high
No disasters or random events
Traffic is at rush hour all day everyday without mods
The last DLC (Snowfall) includes some good stuff, but the main crux is merely vanity and only useable in new games (again, without mods)

If you loved SimCity 4 and are yearning for a modern remake that's not SimCity 2013, this is a good attempt to revive the series. Beware that you'll *need* a few of the mods/workshop to really make the game shine.

With After Dark released, I can finally make a legit review for Cities: Skylines.

Cities is the most polished, realistic, best city building game I have ever played. Coming from early SimCity games and then to Cities XL, I can say that C:SL is a very, very recommended game that I will always recommend to any person interested in these games. I love city builders, and C:SL was amazing from the start. Many features include budget management, detailed transportation info, and many options on roads and how you want to build your city. You can expand your city limits and make your city thrive. With very little bugs and massive modding support, this game is the best of the best. 

Cities After Dark has made it so much better, with activity in your city slowing down (which in turn makes your economy slow down at night, adding a new challenge to the game), as night progresses. Some parts in your districts can be set to accomidate night life to make even more money to compensate for the lost revenue. Taxi services, train lines, bus lines, and subways are options for public transportation. Water and electricity management are vital to survive as a municipality. I love Cities: Skylines!

★★★★★★★★★★
It’s hard to review a game that it’s constantly evolving like [b]Cities: Skylines[/b], so I will keep it short: If you enjoy SimCity, tycoons and management games, you will love Cities: Skylines. There’s so much to do, even with just the base game (which receives free content updates when a new expansion is released) and the DLCs are the icing on the cake. Yes, there are a lot of them, but you don’t need to rush to buy everything at once – each extra content can (and will) keep you occupied for a long time, so buy them little by little. 

If I recall correctly, Cities: Skylines will receive new content until 2020, so there’s still room to grow, and the game is already [b]huge[/b], especially if you count thousands of workshop mods. I can’t recommend it enough – it’s a fun, relaxing and strategic experience that everyone should try at least once. You love classic games, right? This is one of those, and I’m sure it will be remembered with affection in the future.
Colossal Order, Paradox, and Steam Workshop:

I want to thank you all for a fabulous game!

I've played SimCity since its very first release and it was always, up until it's last disappointing release, my all time favorite computer game. Now, looking back it's as if SimCity is the game one plays in childhood (even though I was very much an adult in '89 lol), but as an adult you move up to the real thing. Which is clearly... Cities:Skylines! 

Its a grand city building game to be sure. And Steam Workshop ability moves it into a whole other realm. This game has inspired me to buy and begin the study of books on city planning, urban renewal, city design, environmental impact, traffic patterns, and how people drive and why. And I'm loving it! 

Every new chapter I read inspires me to revisit what I've already built in Cities to find ways to make it a better and happier city for my virtual population. And the tools I need to widen this experience are there for the using tucked nicely into a brilliant computer game. I'm having so much fun! :D

Do I recommend this game? :D  Unreservedly and with happy enthusiasm.
*buys game* 
*starts new land*
*no idea what im doing*
*one hour later*
*figure out how everything works and start expanding the city*
*5 hours later*
*20k population*
*realizes it's already 2am*

...Well shit, this is really addicting. GG.
+ Enjoyable
+ Moddable
+ Reasonable system requirements
+ Made in Finland
+ Published by Paradox Interactive
- Expensive DLCs
- Takes really long to load when modded (the Google Chrome of city building games)
Cities Skylines is what Sim City (2013) should have been. I'm trying to think of a downside besides the fact the there's not a Gold Edition [Edit 2/2017] YES THERE IS YEAH --out that bundles all of the expansions into a single game.--

Build a city and manage traffic from the ground up, master the joy of constructing blocks, roads, interchanges, you name it. Balance power, services, education, pollution, everything you know a good City Builder needs.

Then realize it's 3am and you have work in the morning.
Do you like creation, or city building? If yes to either, give this game a long look. The  two primary ways (soon to be three with the release of scenarios as part of the free update for the Disasters DLC) you'll probably play this game will be either sandboxing with infinite money, or more vanilla which won't use mods. 

What I love:
Scale - The maps are massive. Even in vanilla in which you have access to 9 tiles out of a possible 81, you have a massive space to develop, decorate and grow. As a point of reference, Sim City 2013 maximum city space is equal to 1 square in Cities: Skylines. As a bonus, there are thousands of player created maps in the steam workshop, some of which provide fantastic settings to grow an empire or a small rural city. 

Living Cities - The people and the traffic all have a life, a destination; they're not simply arbitrary numbers detailing their supposed existence. You will be tasked to provide the infrastructure they need to live and will be critical to succeed as mayor, civil engineer, and accountant of your city.  

Cities: Traffic Wars - Some love it, some hate it. I love traffic wars. I love the problem solving, the beautification designing of interchanges; it's a very rewarding feeling when you solve traffic problems successfully. Nothing wrong with that. Yes, there is quirky behavior, but it doesn't detract massively from the experience. I have a couple tips: Leave space for traffic to filter and minimize weaving. That goes a long way. There are player guides that tackle how to solve typical traffic issues such as How to Traffic and even guides that look at traffic flow theory and how it applies to this game. 

Workshop - Mod support and a massive amount of player content means there are enormous number of ways to build a city. Mods provide powerful options to take control, and build with massive freedom. Download responsibly and there will be minimal issues. You aren't limited to zoning and plopping, you can create beautiful, planned cities. The only limitation is your imagination.

Not so great:
DLC - A bit pricey for what you get, excluding After Dark. That dlc is excluded, and I would definitely take no issue paying full price on. Very feature rich. Unfortunately, the same level of praise is not really warranted for Snowfall. Trams and snow maps are nice, but I would not buy it full price. 

Vanilla gameplay - As a first time experience to get achievements, it's fine in its own right, but in comparison to what you can do with the player content regarding the mods (you can use building assets, props, etc. in vanilla), the gameplay is limited and quality of life for the player tends to be lower with the lack of performance mods.

Difficulty - This is a double edged sword. Lack of difficulty is beneficial to those that simply want to build, grow and show off their skills with infrastructure building, and city painting. This is a negative for anyone that wants a challenging economy in vanilla. This will hold particularly true if you like that kind of gameplay in Simcity. Fortunately, for the challenge inclined, you can make it much harder on yourself with mods, and Scenarios are coming out soon, which will provide win and lose condition scenarios as part of the Disasters dlc. It will be free.

TLDR: Love building, traffic wars, the almost endless beautification options, and I can be a major creep as I roleplay God with my topdown world view  as I stalk a handsome young man coming home from work as he goes home to sleep at night (he actually does live in that house). Glorious. Would I recommend to anyone that remotely likes city builders? Absolutely.
Cities: Skylines is a brand new city-building game in the vein of Simcity but built with modern sensibilities.

What is Great about this game:

- The city-building simulation is deep, complex, and incredibly satisfying to master
- The agent and traffic simulation is particularly deep and compelling to manage
- A variety of tools are available to manage almost any problem that arises in your city
- The game looks and runs beautifully
- Available areas for expansion are massive (and truly huge with easy to acquire mods)
- Modding and Steam Workshop support is pervasive in the game, and the modding community is prolific

What is Good about this game:

- Good use of Steam features (cloud saves, trading cards, achievements, etc)

What is Bad about this game:

- Some of the mechanics of the simulation (e.g. freight train depots, RCI) are not well surfaced so it can be a challenge to know how to answer certain problems

Conclusion:

Cities: Skylines is the new benchmark in city building and city simulation games.  This is the game to get if you are at all interested in the genre, and everyone should at least try it once.

10.0 / 10.0
I love seeing my cims using the public transport to get around the city.
I love watching the cims zip along my elevated bicycle paths.
I love watching my cims pile in and out of schools and universities and parks.
I hate seeing the traffic pile up!
I love trying to fix the traffic!
I love watching the buildings upgrade.  (That ding sound is so satisfying!)
I love the content the dev's continually produce that actually improves the game.
I love the community, and all the amazing assets everyone has created and shared.
I love the discussion the game creates, and the advice freely given and taken.
I will never be satisfied with my city.  I always want to improve it, and this game lets me do that.  It doesn't get old.

My only desire is to have a multiplayer function where I can play with my friends as neighbors, with interactive trade, assistance during natural disasters, policy conflicts, competition for tourists and trade and leisure etc.

Edit (Feb 13 2018) - I just wanted to add that I recently tried sharing some basic assets I created on the Workshop.  I am compelled to say how thrilling it is to be able to participate in, and contribute to the absolutely WONDERFUL community this game has cultivated.  It is a pleasure and a privilege to be able to use such beautiful creations, and to witness the 10's of thousands of subcribers to the creations of so many talented individuals, and to view the constructive feedback of those players.

This is hands down the best community of any game I have ever encountered and it is a pleasure to be a small part of it that I would recommend to anyone.
[h1]To honor this great game I deleted my old review and spend some time writing a new one.[/h1]

You should know that this game is a [u]long-term investment.[/u] You have to spend a lot of time on it fine tuning but in exchange you'll get back a lot of excitement and room for creativity. You can start playing this game with [b]no knowledge[/b] about city builder games but you will soon notice that the larger you city gets the more challenging the road network becomes. 

Although you need a bit of patient or else you won't like the game as much. You will have to bulldoze and rebuild streets sometimes multiple times. Just don't see it as negative point and don't get frustrated. Similar as if you draw a picture. 
Since this is a city builder you will spend most of your time designing road layouts and managing traffic. 

No one likes too much talking so here in short the positive and negative points.

[u]Positive:[/u]
[list]
[*]great graphics. Subjective yes, but you can customize the colors (LUT). If you install the correct one it will look photo realistic instead of colorful
[*]easy to learn. Even if you're a total beginner you will find fun in creating 
[*]huge "Wuselfaktor" as we say in German. "bustling factor" might be the translation for it
[*]extreme high replay value
[*]awesome community with massive amount of mods on the workshop. I highly recommended to install at least the following must-have.
[*]low system requirements without mods
[*]low price for base game
[*]huge maps to build on
[*]different map themes
[*]Some content from DLCs is free for base game owners
[*]weather and day/night circle
[*]creating own districts and add policies
[/list]
[u]Negative:[/u]
[list]
[*]traffic sometimes doesn't want to use up all lanes. Thankfully I don't have this problem so often. There are multiple workarounds you can find, nevertheless it's my only real critics point. I managed to avoid this mostly by using highway exits only on one side. (So there are 2 lanes in total for the main traffic and one for the off/on ramps) As of writing the review the developers rejected to ever fix it. As reason for this they state the increase of the system requirements needed. 
[*]no real on/off ramps for highways (they are basically just one-lane highways)
[*]vanilla buildings without mods are a bit too repetitive
[*]expensive DLCs (for that little content they add. Nevertheless you support the developers and got a cheap base game. I got myself most DLCs by now on a sale)
[*]chirpy can get annoying ;)
[*]the following must-have mods should have been in the base game
[/list]

Right now I have 280 mods installed. The game doesn't crash on my system regularly [i]but it can happen.[/i] As always I recommend to save often with that many mods. 


PS: On the workshop there are 96.363 mods atm. Skyrim has 49,910 on Nexus mods. ;)
Cities: Skylines has become my favorite city building/management system game since the earlier Sim City games. Placed in a vast canvas you have the opportunity to build the city of your vision, but at a cost of demanding civilians wanting every single ounce of their needs met. This is a game challenging you the further you progress.

Pros:

- Plenty of maps to choose from (even more with the DLC)
- Realistic traffic flow, your city suffers if there are to many high traffic zones.
- The ability to separate policies per district is a huge plus.
- The city's leveling progression is a nice take on how well you're improving and also gifts you with funds.
- The building dynamics is easy to learn and also lets you remove the snap to grid feature to build roads however you want.
- Plenty of different buildings and community lots to build to assist the happiness of your citizens.

Cons:

- I'm not a huge fan in the beginning of building a new city you are sort of forced to build off of a highway, I understand people need a port into the city, but if you do want to build off and away from the highway it can become expensive.
- Some of the citizens needs become tedious at times, especially during the later stages of a big city. The challenge is great, but at times you just see the little thought bubble and  you want to bulldoze that person's house.
- Even though I paid for all of the DLC, after thinking about the purchases some of the DLC content should be integrated into the game for free.

Despite it all, I love this game. It can be relaxing when you take the city building process with its fair amount of challenge.  Compared to EA's latest Sim City game, Cities: Skylines buries it in all aspects.
hmm, after 42 hrs i got onto this game, i finnally reviewed this game,

[list]
[*]1-10 hrs : Learning about the game
[*]20-25 hrs : Learning about make +++ profit in game
[*]25-30 hrs : learning how to manage services stop area
[*]35-40 hrs : learning how to manage dead people
[*]40- now hrs : still dunno how to manage dead people in right way

10/10, because got day/night cycle update :)
I’ve been completely consumed by Cities: Skylines.. It’s everything that SimCity should have been.. There are massive maps, a simulation that appears to work very well, a great interface, lovely visuals, an editor and the ability to really mod the game properly.. 9/10
I am adding my update  review and video . Review is mostly unedited (though shortened) for posterity. 

[url=https://kinglink-reviews.com/2018/11/23/cities-skylines-review/] Full Review[/url] --  

https://youtu.be/dXL9aekqpL0

I wasn’t sure what to expect when I booted Cities: Skylines.  After Cities in Motion, games that focused on mass transit as their first two games, I was almost definite I was going to have a bad time as I disliked both of those games on some level. 

A couple hours later I was a bit surprised because the hours flew by.  I’ve heard Cities: Skylines is a SimCity clone.  In reality, it’s a fantastic Simcity, far better than EA’s always online SimCity that they produced.  In fact, it’s released two years after the SimCity release and just is better in every way possible.  No online, great gameplay, and not as many really annoying bugs (such as traffic). 

That’s the thing though, Cities Skylines is SimCity, if you hate the idea of city building, you’re probably not going to be happy here.  If you miss classic SimCity, this is a must own.  It’s not the same game, but it’s an excellent replacement for it, far superior in almost every way.

The big thing in Cities Skylines is the growth of the city ties to items. When your city is a village, you can only create certain objects.  Garbage is locked until you 440 people, The Police department is unlocked at 850 people.  Want a Solar Power Plant to be green?  Get 18,000 people and not a second before that.  It actually is a great way to scope the game and let you focus on tasks right in front of you than give you infinite choices and have you build stuff you don’t need but it can limit the game in the early game.  This might not be for everyone though.

Which is why there are mods, glorious mods!  The game ships with three mods if I remember correctly (I’ve gotten a lot since then), the Unlimited money mod, the unlock all mod, and the hard mode mod.  The unlimited money and unlock all mods both will unlock all buildings.  But there’s a LOT of mods for this game and a ton of great support through mods.  Basically, if you don’t like something in Cities Skylines there is a mod for it.  

But the building system does have one thing that’s quite cool.  There are unique buildings in which the player has to fulfill some minor or major task such as construct a certain type of building 30 times, or produce a certain amount of goods.  If you do that, you get a special building to customize your city with and give your city bonus usually a tourism, but they also help you build the big monuments which are awesome to aim for. 

So it’s like a great version of SimCity, what’s different? 

Well, first there’s a number of tools that aren’t as good as others.  The road tool seems to hate perfect lines.  I want to draw perfect grids such as can be found in New York City.  Just long lines of perfect roads.  The road tool seems to hate me and I seem to fail at this often.  The roads do snap to each other at specific points, but I seem to miss the 90 degrees by a few degrees often.  I’m sure there’s some button to make these roads perfect but it should be easy to do this. 

I’ve tried to do highways and such and it’s sometimes a bit hard to make the connecting road matchup without an odd design. They’re just something not 100 percent right with the way it creates roads, not to mention curves. 

The reason you want perfect roads is that the grid for the city has little squares, and anything other than a perfect rectangle gives you spaces in the grid or little gaps that don’t look too bad, but can limit growth They are minor breaks but they don’t look that good and the best buildings won’t be built there. 

Zoning is well done though and it’s easy to throw down different types of building quickly, and replacing buildings with services don’t seem to hurt the neighborhoods much (The area around the service buildings, like a police station, recovers exceedingly fast.) 

The game does add a fantastic tool that lets you build districts.  But what’s brilliant here, is you can paint the district, applying almost a blob to an area so you can make your own design and rename your districts what you want.  You can also change policies specifically for that area if you want.  It’s great to grow as you decide.  The management of these districts is far easier than I expected, but I’m not a micromanager.  I like to run “Freelandia!”  where you can do what you want.  However the micromanagement with the districts is fun, and it makes your city look great. I love naming areas with different names or recreating real places I have visited in San Diego, LA, Orlando, or of course Boston.  Or just name everything after body parts.  The choice is yours.

I’ve always loved city building, and the experience of just watching a city grow, and that exact experience is here.  It takes some time but eventually the player gets an idea how to figure out what’s going on or what problems to tackle.  Sadly the game doesn’t have the best complaint system unless you look at buildings.  Anything wrong and there’s a little complaint on top of a house.  There’s a twitter style feed on the top of the screen that tells you random things going on in your little corner of the world, but it doesn’t give a deep understanding of what’s going on.  Imagine if a mayor of a town could only find out what’s going on with a twitter feed.  It’s a little silly, the single interactions with the populace doesn’t work.  I'd have preferred an advisor telling me what are the major issues people are talking about.

In addition, the game is VERY slow.  A single day is 10 seconds… at that rate you pass a year in an hour of constant running.  That’s a bit long in my opinion.  But triple speed makes a day only … 5 seconds!  Wait what?  Yeah.. triple speed only doubles the time in my test.  That means a year is 30 minutes.  That’s quite slow still.  I’m sure it’s due to the simulation time and such, but really, quite slow.  The game is focused on weekly cycles instead of monthlies but it’s a very long year. 

The one thing I’m not a fan of here is that the game currently promotes its expansions and there’s a lot.  It’s starting to become like the Sims, where there’s tons of content each one in its own expansion.  Luckily the game doesn’t feel like you need expansions as the main game is fantastic on its own and fully featured, but if you have to have it all.  In fact, there’s good quality of life additions to the game along with the expansions.  However, it feels that expansions are a bit of a mixed blessing.  You can remove DLC from Steam by uninstalling the DLC itself but in game, if they are installed they are always on.  Want to switch from a Snowfall game to a one without?  You need to uninstall the DLC. 

Yet the player can avoid all the DLC and the game is still fantastic, it’s a fully featured game with a lot of depth.  The ability to grow your city and then tackle new problems is rather refreshing as you can focus your talents on the smaller tasks even on a second playthrough.  Designing your city is easier when you’re able to focus on it at first.  You can fly through the ranks quickly especially once you know what you’re doing.

There’s a  very solid UI as well once you learn it, and interesting challenges for the player to tackle.  There’s not much here I dislike.  Even the annoyances are minor in comparison.  I plop down a few zones and I start remembering why I love this game.  It’s not just that it reminds me of a great game.  It’s a great game on its own.  While I didn’t like Cities in Motion much, this is exactly the game I was hoping they would make, and now that it’s here.  It is kind of fantastic. 

So ....

If you enjoyed this review or want to see my opinion on other games you can find my curator page at this link.  http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31803828-Kinglink-Reviews/ Give me a follow
I was very conflicted with this game up until recently. The main issue I have is this: When your city gets big enough the game is a piece of cake. There is depth in the city painter part of the game, but close to none in the management side of things. For a long time I'd play the game, after several hours my city would become extremely profitable and then I'd play for a few more hours before uninstalling and waiting for a new DLC that would add management depth. That DLC never came. The next DLC won't bring it. Unfortunately I doubt it ever will.  What made me go from that level of disappointment to really liking the game? Seeing in a new light. This game is an amazing city builder. Amazing painter of cities. If you want to create a city that looks and feels like you want it to you have that ability. Building what seems like a giant county of varied and unique zones with different looking towns and purposes is the best I've ever seen. Playing this game with the intention of making my own New York or London is what it's near perfect as. The DLC just gives more tools to diversify the environment. So if picture a city in your head you can make it in this game. The opportunities are there
 If you want to struggle to build and maintain it with tons of management tools this isn't for you. Overall it's a 9/10 for me
Absoultely wonderful game!  I have played over 850 hours.  This is what SimCity 5 should have been.  This game was obviously made by people who love city building and played previous city simulatons.  Everything works right.  Slow initial city loading time but from there all is smooth.   Many ways to play.  Lay out a design for a big city or small town are the fine as they are, or soon grown and eventually join.   Lots to learn to be more efficient.  Can be played casual or challenging. As with real cities traffic congestion and polution soon become a growing problem.  Lots of in game items that are solutions...  But it is very satifying to figure out your own unique designs and solutions.   A big active community of support is another good feature of this game.   I had all my friends by this game they all liked it or loved it as I do.   I highly recommend it.
Yes, yes, a million times, yes!!  After 900 hours of gameplay, I can safely say that this game is my absolute, all-time favorite.  Are there things I wish would be improved on? Sure.  But it clearly doesn't stop me from playing.  The flourishing modding community sets an example that other games should strive to achieve.
Cities Skylines is a wonderful city builder, it puts in so many unnessesary details that just make the game feel so alive.

Pros:
+Beautiful.
+Camera controls are nice.
+Crazy amounts of tiny details that go from every person having a name, house and job to street light flickering before they change.
+A nice selection of maps to choose from.
+Has that nice classic city builder feel to it.
+Looks very modern.
+Day 1 mod support.
+Easy to use level editor+ building creator thing.
+Lots of options for obtaining resourses.
+Developers seem to be active and nice.
+Sounds are nice.
+Rewards you for milestones
+Has actual water physics (which are not needed in a city game but are just another nice feature).

Cons:
-People are not happy with leisure even if there are parks everywhere
-Some people won't be educated even though there is a school next to them.
-Some of the random "tweets" get repetitive.
-Dosen't have a tutorial for people who have never played a city builder before.
-Because there is no tutorial I have no way or pre-planning anything that's about to come my way and I end up not being able to build things I need.
-Citizens leave not because they are unhappy but because you didn't build something specific which the game wanted you to build which is a bit dumb.
-Vehicles sometimes dissapear.
-Bus, Metro, Trains and the rest of those are really frustrating to build and are really hard to learn how to even make without looking up a tutorial.
-Sometimes the game won't let you build a road/build ext. because there is something in the way, but there isn't.

Overall I rate this game a 9/10 has a fair amount of issues but still very fun and is a great game.
The +'s

+ Very Detailed Buildings, Roads, Cars, down to the physics in the water 
+ Huge areas of land
+ Multiple landscapes to pick from
+ Ton of premade worlds to get started in
+ Trains, Boats, Airplanes, Subway, Hearses, Trash Trucks, Fire Engine, Police Car, Ambulance and a bunch more animated vehicles!
+ Every person is doing something in the city, with cool activities like a ton of different style parks, and hey actually animate them doing it!! Create a bus route and don't enough stops ? Hahaha well you will have a ton of people waiting outside because not enough stops and buses to meet the demand.
+Awesome path editor with many different road types and bridges and scenery
+ Steam Workshop
+Easy UI
+ Progressing with milestones feels rewarding
+ Wind Turbines turn against wind, I thought this was really cool.

Now there is a ton more +'s but my hand hurts from carpool tunnel from playing the game like 15 hours straight so

Heres the -'s

-Pathing on cars sometimes sucks bad
-Not really many events other than random fires which don't spread =( ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )
-Road pathing tool can be pretty annoying when trying to upgrade skinny streets to wide streets
-No Auto Save Feature (Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively)
-No Cycle of day and night ( Yes, there is a mod for this! Still should be done natively )
-Sometimes the game moves at such a fast pace that's not desirable, usually people like to speed it -up but if you have a decent city, the demand for structures will never stop or slow down! ( Can pause but a slow down option ? )
-Wish there was weather other than the wind is moving this way or that way


Things I would like in the game

*Riots ( Maybe a military base with units ? or swat team that could stop riots ?)
*More Events
*Spreading Fire ( Natively ) 
*( I am not sure if it exists outside of a mod ) But snow?
*More things for people to do other than parks and plazas ( Baseball Park, Football Stadium, etc... I *know the workshop will have tons of this stuff, but it would be nice to have the professional touch on more buildings with animations! )  Btw the soccer park in the work shop is pretty cool!
*Seasons that change on time of year
*Night Mode with lighted sky scrapers and other models

I highly recommend this game, although it's more serious sim then that which you can have fun destroying your creations ( at the time being at least ). $30 dollars is a great steal, if you are affraid of DLC, the workshop should ease that a but with over 20,000 items and growing!
I used to play and enjoy SimCity but I was sometimes disappointed especially with the traffic simulation. Then a friend recommended me to try Cities: Skylines. At first I thought it seemed a bit confusing compared to SimCity but after a while it became easy to play and I started enjoying it. I am impressed with the traffic simulation. It is very realistic and there are far more options when building roads. Of course SimCity has advantages in other ways but I am pleasantly surprised by Cities: Skylines and I can definitely recommend it!

P.S. You end up being addicted to the game :D
Cities: Skylines is the city builder I've been waiting for since 2004. It is intuitive, has actual working citizen travel, flowing water, (mostly) realistic travel... and looks beautiful.
It is also designed to be mod friendly and mods are already expanding the game within the first weeks of release.

And no forced online or tiny city sizes. Even without mods, you can built a huge metropolis in this game.

Downsides: traffic isn't perfect, so you can end up with unrealistic traffic patterns. The devs are working on this though.
Music is forgettable. Nothing like the excellent SimCity series :/

And it is extremely addictive. This game will cause you to be tired at work because you stayed up until 3am on a working day...

TDLR: Best City Builder in over a decade. Buy it today.
Fuck this fucking game. 

Played it for little bit during a free weekend a while back. Got the bite. And, I try to stay away. I really do. But it calls out to me. My citizens need me. I have roads to build and zones to declare. I have production issues and labor shortfalls. I have electrical outages and traffic backups. What now? Oh yeah, that citizens won't want to drink raw sewage. My bad. 

I hate loving to play this game so much. And I don't even own any of the DLC. FML.
Cities: Skylines is the unofficial SimCity sequel we deserve! From the very beginning, the game feels much closer to SimCity 4 than the most recent iteration of SimCity. The game embraces Steam Workshop, and the amount of custom content already is outstanding. I have enjoyed every second thus far with the game and I wanted to share my thoughts on it for those of you on the fence.

PROS
-Steam Workshop Integration
-Massive Cities
-Enjoyable Challenge
-Cities Feel Alive
-Hours and Hours of Content
-Great Price for Launch
-Allows for Cities of All Shapes and Sizes

CONS
-Traffic Needs Some Balancing
-Lots of Repeated Buildings (Custom Content Helps)
-Trash and Death Can Get Out of Hand Due to Traffic

All in all, I recommend Cities: Skylines to anyone who considers themselves fans of the simulation genre. The game is addictive and provides hours of fun. I am 15 hours in and I only have 50,000 people in my city with so much more land available to grow. The $30 is fair, but there is no excuse not to pick this game up at a sale price!

For anyone looking for countless hours of fun, this is your game. Cities: Skylines provides countless hours of fun, but challenging, hours of game play. In cities: Skylines, you get to basically manage your own city. To sum it up, Cities: Skylines is the best city manager simulation I know. Here are some pros and cons of the game.
PROS:
-Beautiful Graphics
-Good concept
-Has amazing workshop Mods
-Thrill of being able to tax other people (my favorite!)
-Easy to learn about
-Provides a challenge (in some ways) 
-Great for players looking for something to do
-The new Natural Disasters are amazing!
-The new DLC Natural disasters lets you bust criminals from a helicopter
These are just some of the pros this game provides

CONS
Every game has a downside to it. Here are a few you might want to think about before buying
-Some of the in-game challenges such as death care and traffic can be hard to solve, but can be resolved with experience and (LOTS) of patience
-Id say a good computer is needed to play this game without lag. This game is playable with lag, but will slightly impact your enjoyment of the game.

Overall, Cities: Skylines is a great game. I've been playing this for a while now, and I believe I will continue to do. I look forward to the next update and recommend for players to buy this game.
I cannot drive on the roads anymore without thinking of traffic  optimizations, this game ruined my  enjoyment of driving. Totally rrcommend it even in 2018
I had actually started to believe that we were never going to see another great city simulator and then Paradox sprung this on us. Cities: Skylines went back to the simulators that were fun, pulled the best parts of them, and upgraded them to today's standards. It's fun without being overly punishing but still provides a challenge for those of us who want it. Sure it isn't perfect, but there are few games that even scratch that lofty goal.

Probably the biggest issue is the lifespan of the citizens. All citizens lead a perfect and full life. This means if you have 2000 people move into your city all at once, they all die at the same time. It's really frustrating until you realize what's happening at the simulation. But there's a mod that changes that, giving citizens variable length lives.

But that's the only [i]real[/i] problem with this game. There can be some other gripes made about performance of 100k+ cities and traffic management nightmares, but I've never met a modern simulator that doesn't have those issues. Simply put, if you want a city simulator that's worth the money, you can't go wrong with Cities: Skylines.
It's ok, but I wouldn't care about it at all if there weren't mods and assets.

Modding takes this game to an entirely different level and I consider more than 60 mods as essential and "part of the game" at this point. And it's constantly getting better.
Having spent 200+ hours in the game, I can honestly say Cities Skylines is, overall, a really awesome game. There is a learning curve, when you start playing it takes some serious time getting to know how everything works. You will build cities that will seem amazing in the beginning, but will soon turn out to be utter disasters when it comes to traffic and such. After some time, though, you will get better and better at building cities, and this is when the real fun starts.

The only really negative thing I have to say about Cities Skylines, is that the DLC's are seriously overpriced. Don't buy them unless they are on a discount. For real.. Don't..
If you're reading this, I'm glad you take the time to read reviews before you buy a game. But I can assure you, you can stop reading reviews for this game and buy it right now (or as soon as you can). Simply put, this is the best city-builder released for more than 12 years, since SimCity 4. Half the price as SimCity 2013 but with many more features, this game is easily worth the $30 price tag. Perhaps even buy the deluxe edition for the extra $10; the developers deserve it (the game was made by a team of about ten people).

So stop reading this review and buy the game.

For those still unsure about their purchase of this game, I'll now list some of my favorite parts, many of which SimCity 2013 and other city-builders lacked.

[list]
[*]1.) One-way-roads and roundabouts
[*]2.) Water physics: water pumps, sewage drains, treatment plants, and dams influence water levels
[*]3.) Parked cars. Doesn't seem like this should be a new feature in city-builders, but it is. Cars park on the side of the road and in parking spots.
[*]4.) Districts and policies: paint districts on certain parts of your city to keep track of things better and issue local policies.
[*]5.) Mods galore. The workshop is filled with various mods and the game has an asset and map editor built in.
[/list]

Hopefully that small list of a few of my favorite things has convinced you to buy the game. Cities: Skylines will undoubtedly reshape the city-building genre, and will continue to do so for years to come, as the devs have promised extended support to as much as ten years.

UPDATED Sept 24th, 2015:
For the DLC haters out there, this game will have plenty of DLC during it's long run. However, they'll be cheap (the one just released, After Dark, is only15 USD) and add actually new things that matter. Releasing along side every DLC is a patch that adds plenty of new features for people who don't buy the DLC (in the case of After Dark, non-DLC people will still get the day-night cycle among other things for free).
Cities: Skylines is a city builder game of your dreams. You can design almost every detail including appearance of buildings, parks and other stuff, but it is only for the most fanatic players. General player population (Inc. Myself) will get with projecting town streets where the game also gives you a huge opportunity to be creative by designing every angle, every corner of the streets and planning where will be commercial, residential and industrial zones as we know it from the old Simcity franchise. You have to care about your citizens to make city prosperous, build hospitals, police offices, fire stations, cemeteries, public transport systems, roads etc. and enable easy access to these facilities.  If you do it right there won't be problems with traffic jams and that's the biggest obstacle not only in every simulator of this type, but also in real life. 

So the Cities: Skylines has everything it should, but it also has another assets to offer: unlocking buildings like Hadron Collider or Fusion power plant and many more can get your attention and believe me achieving those is a long way. One of the most interesting things are districts and policies. You can divide your city into smaller districts applying another policies in different parts. For example you can lower taxes in newly developing areas to grab attection of investors or ban smoking and demand smoke detectors in industrial areas to prevent them from fire threat and many more. I really appreciated land value index by which you can deduce how different city parts are doing.

The game can entertrain you for hours and it's really fun, but there are some imperfections I have to criticize. The most significant is  once you get from the first struggles of a newly developing town, after making the first profits the game seems to me too easy, I'd appreciate some random events, all i care after that is traffic and that's what can be really annoying after a while.

Basically one of the best city-builders ever. If you're looking for a hardcore game where failure is always right around the corner, than this isn't really the game for you, but if you want a relaxing experience(apart from the traffic managing... really, f**k traffic)  building the perfect city in an amazingly detailed builder this is the game for you.
Gad damnit, this is so much fun. Just think of it as simcity x18. It has so much more content, almost no bugs, waaay bigger city borders, amazing trafic system, and much more. It's basicly the best city sandbox out there! 10/10
This is pretty much all I wanted in a city sim since I put down Sim City 4.

I'm a bit of a dinosaur in that I still prefer the isometric pixel art of yore, and Cities: Skylines has a more "clean/cartoon" art style than I'd like. But apart from that, it pretty much gets everything right. The UI is easy, functional, and still manages to be deep. Systems seem both complex and accessible.

I've enjoyed it for hours out of the box, I'm looking forward to player mods, and the future expansions and add-ons. I think this one's a long-term keeper!
I have put 300+ hours into this game and i cant stop playing, you can do so many different things each time you play its a whole new game. The community of modders is huge you can change your game and never get bored! i love Cities!
AMAZING GAME from an old Ceasar 3 fan... its so easy when you turn on the "endless funds" on this game ... but the downside is that you reach higher levels way to fast and problems pill up even faster... mine was pollution even if i was liked due to null taxes and high salaries and i was quickly promoted and city was well rated, still i faced pollution from start to end because i built city infrastructures wrong on sewers and clean water. Loved it 200% but ended to soon even before i could send my rocket to space = not enough resources = wrong industries = pollution... every thing you build has a consequence so think wisely and on long therm.
The best city builder ever. All the mods support they have for this game is just awesome. Really if you like city building games you have to buy it ASAP.
Did you wish SimCity 2013 had really delivered a proper next gen massive evolution on the SimCity gameplay? Well right about the time EA was telling us they could never do a SP offline mode for SimCity; Cities Skylines swoops up out of Colossus Order and Paradox. Built out a proper "next gen" kind of SimCity game... Better in nearly every way than SimCity with a really massive amount of expandable content thru dlc and workshop asset/mod support. You want the best SimCity ever made? You've found it. It's called Cities Skylines.
Plain and simple, this is what the Sim City series should've grown to. This is the dream of city building, with a massive MOD community, you are certain that you will never be out of new models, scenarios, buildings, traffic mechanics, and so and so forth. The base game is already top notch, with the expansion, it only enriches the experience. I am genuinely in love with this game. If you love city building games, this is a must.
It's like someone finally decided to make a worthy successor to SimCity 4.

"But Coprolite," you say, "They made a sequel to..."

It's like someone finally decided to make a worthy successor to SimCity 4, jumping off from that point and developing greater complexity while expanding in scope.  It's a far cry at this point from the early city builders. This game can be almost daunting to get into, and it can be oh so easy to have everything bog down in gridlock. I've lost count of how many cities I started and threw away because my initial foundations just didn't work. A wealth of expansions and an uncountable horde of mods only adds to this complexity.

But with this complexity comes an experience that you can lose yourself in with tinkering. Tinkering with road networks. Tinkering with bus routes. Tinkering with the latest neighbourhood. Speaking of which, you can actually have those, breaking your city up into regions which you can apply different policies to or different design aesthetics. Your city can evolve into a complex patchwork of specialisations and characters. Like I just spent hours building a lovely transit-oriented development with a park and trail network at its core.

And this is a game that has been growing, evolving, constantly adding functionality.

Fair warning: this game can be a bit of a beast, especially as your cities get larger. Still, I built my PC in 2014 on an i5 processor with 16GB of RAM, which I threw a new graphics card into last year. It's not exactly a powerhouse, but it can still manage some pretty sizeable cities.
What Sim City 2013 should have been. Cities Skylines feels in many ways like a true spiritual successor to the Sim City series in many ways while expanding upon many of the concepts and ideas. There is great deal of micromanagement it never feels to overwhelming and all comes naturally as your city expand. You will manage everything from waste disposal to public transport and of course traffic flow. In addition you can also designate areas as districts which allows you to more fine tune policy. There is also a very active and robust modding community and the ability to create and share your own assets if the base game content does not satisfy you. The perfect timesink game to spend an afternoon on.
Simply a great city builder game. There are so many ways to play and a very active, very talented modding community. One word of warning - if you get too heavily into the custom assets and mods the game will devour whatever RAM you have. It uses all my 32GB.
Great game Takes More skill than it looks... It is great to watch your city grow and balance every part of it WELL worth the 30 dollars spent. Bigger towns take more cpu and gpu load so a Gtx 1050 or 1050ti works great at max settings Gtx 1050 for 900p and Ti for 1080p (I use the ti version) They are always updating this game and I will enjoy watching it grow.
It's a bit pricy, but the game is really good. There are a lot more extra details than you would find in SimCity. It's basically a really good, more realistic version of SimCity. But please, please, get autobulldoze removing abandoned buildings manually is so annoying.
First city builder I have played since Sim City. Easy to pick up and learn with lots to do. Having a lot of fun trying to build my city and expect many more hours of joy.
Excellent game. Traffic and people mechanics make the game much richer than other similar titles. Very good to exercise your creativity while keeping logic to avoid traffic jams, pollution and other service failures.
This game is quite like SimCity for the first time I saw. However, when I played, I can compare a lot of features which is better than other city building games. In addition, There are many Mods you can use in this game and this made you more enjoyable.
Do you want to sink hours into a city, only for your residents to constantly complain about garbage piling up? Even though you've got 20 garbage dumps on clear roads? So you build more? But then that lowers the happiness of all your residents, so they all move out, and you get into debt? And then your wife leaves you, the sewage piles up, you lose your mortgage, the riverbanks flood, all the wind turbines start helicoptering off into the air...

10/10
Like City Builders with Strategy?
Like Sim City but hate the roads?
Want to be a horrible city planner?
Want to be the best gridmaker out there?

This game has it all; from slums to riches it will immerse you in a 
well thought out pattern of systems that connect with each other.

Good game, suprisingly accurate.
Downside is that issues with your city are never explained to you, and only Google might help.
There are too many features locked behind DLC paywalls, which partly justifies the high price of those DLCs.

Overall, try it. You'll like it
Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads
This game is really fun although in later cities i recommend mods that change the pathing of garbage trucks and hearses as they can go to weird places sometimes.
This is easily my favorite game in my Steam Library. Cities Skylines is, in my opinion, the best modern-day city builder. It's easy once you get the hang of the controls and it really lets you do as you please. Most other city builders are limited in what you can do/place, and only let you build small towns. In this game, you can build huge cities. The game is amazing on it owns, and most of the major DLCs are good as well. I don't say this about many games, but this is the one game (That has workshop support) that I could play completely vanilla and still have fun. Of course, the workshop is truly amazing for this game. One of the best if you ask me, want to make NYC? download some building styles, vehicles and a map and there you go. There are many talented workshop artists for Cities Skylines and there content is truly wonderful. Overall, if your someone who loves city building want to freely build your city, or love to add in tiny details to your work, then this is the game for you. To once again sum this game up, I highly recommend it if you were thinking of getting it. I've spend many hours on this game, and I don't regret any of them. :)
I´ve had lot´s of fun playing this game, doing scenarios and just messing about. It´s relatively ´easy´ on the computer, until you discover the Workshop. I recommend buying this when you can, even better if you could buy it on sale.
This game is definitely the experience you want, if you're seeking a game like "Sim City," but want a more updated version.
The design is sleek, fun, and interactive. 

For those of you wanting to buy it without having played a city simulation before, THIS GAME REQUIRES PATIENCE.
I like playing this game. Sadly I've stopped because I cant find a solution to my services not sending out units. My medical clinics and hospitals were not sending ambulances and I started losing 2000 people a week and I can't find any solutions on how to fix other than people saying I hope it gets patched from 2016 and 2017. Otherwise great game just a hardcore bug that demoralized me from wanting to keep playing.
Most helpful game for me to learn about economy and politics
Im addicted to this game reader then other other fps game

One thing that I need to add this game is :          Add apocalypse (not natural) like zombie, infection, virus, etc

8/10
Great game! It's super detailed and it has the perfect framework for building a city that feels alive and realistic. If the idea of building a city, watching it grow, and managing all the finer aspects of development and operation that allow cities to run smoothly, you'll like this game. It can be a little overwhelming at first especially since there's not really a tutorial that explains how to play in a helpful way, but once you pass the learning curve you're in for a good time. 

You'll also probably end up sitting in front of your computer for more hours than you expect because the game is super addicting. Great way to ignore friends and loved ones if you're into the kind of masochistic stuff that destroys relationships. Then again, if you haven't lost a friend or two because of how much you're playing Cities: Skylines, then are you really playing Cities: Skylines to the best of your ability? I think not.
I recommend this game but if you really want to get into it make sure you have plenty of hardware. The game is great but the mods make it 10x greater.
Great game!

I feel like the modification options are the best on the market for city building.
I've personally downloaded too many mods, but i feel like degrading my PC from $3000 beast to a potato will be worth it
for the looks, and looks only.

The community workshop is amazing, and is absolutely worth the money.

Although i wish there could be a coop multiplayer mode, and sometimes the game crashes.
A bustling variety of options to develop the city and resolve it's momentous setbacks provide a rewarding gaming experience, not only reinvigorating the fatigue in the sim genre but in the video game industry as entire. Never has my Autism basked in serotonin more than witnessing neat traffic flow through my custom-cut DCMI's. Asphalt spaghetti.
my favorite map is archipelago, even though there is like 90% water, i can build multiple towns just like sims city 5 but that game sucks because its limited and crap, this game is 100% better than sims city 5 and almost basically the same game as sims city 4, my childhood game :) 11/10 ty colossal order and paradox :D
This game changed their privacy policy, and if you don't accept it, they won't let you play it anymore. This game that you paid for. Years ago. How about if I click no you don't track my personal data rather than kicking me out of this game that I paid for.
This game changed their privacy policy, and if you don't accept it, they won't let you play it anymore. Why would you need my personal data? It is only a bloody game!
I can't say I would recommend this game. The amount of additional content available that should have been included in the game originally is absurd. $13 for a snow effect, $15 for nightfall,  $13 for transit, and a bunch of other "additional content" packs that where probably included in the original game design but branded and marketed as extras. Yuck.
What kind of scumbags update their privacy policy after their game has been out for years, and if you don't accept their spying you aren't allowed to play the game you already paid for anymore? On a singleplayer no less. There are no words for practices this terrible, this pathetic, you absolute bastards should be taken to court.
Another video game company changing their eulas to take personal and private information that they have no use for but to sell to others, or be hacked. These are the reasons why ppl get their personal info hacked and personal info stolen for reasons like this. A game distributor/dev has no reason to obtain personal info about each persons personal life. Its a bloody game ffs.
1 star review simply because Paradox force you to accept terms & conditions where they collect all your personal data without being being given a change to opt-out, even though I've just purchased for the damn product - I think it's non of Paradox's f**king business what games I play, when I play them, or for how long.

I hope others follow suite in leaving 1 star reviews for games where their developers disrespect their customers via the forceful collection of personal information.
It's not a bad game, but not great.

The city building part is kind of non existing. It's more of a Traffic simulator.
The economy is really simple, just look at the green, blue and yellow bar. And build accordingly.
Build some schools, hospital, police and firestations. What I miss is spending time with the politics of a city.

You can literally build a residential area next to a industrial complex and nobody complains.
When exiting my computer locks up everytime.  I have to use task manager to get out.   The graphics are good but the animations are non existent..  There are none when bulldozing.   I am not pleased.  I wasted my mnoney.  This is like a bad copy of EA games last Sim City which was not good.  Sims 4 is still the way to go.  Not this.
-Spyware
-Basic content/functions released as DLCs instead of updates. 
-Every new city you make plays like a tutorial, stuff locked away for no good reason. Played almost 200 hours, don't need a tutorial.
-Achievements gets disabled when you use mods, and you need mods to make it playable.
-Bad traffic simulation/ai.
FUCK Your Data Gathering Paradox Interactive!

Why do you "need" to collect so much data? Why not keep it simple - collecting only usernames, email and OS for example? Why... I will not play this game- because I do not agree to this. Steam also didn't warn me about this, it only said I had to agree to a EULA, but not this shit.
Poorly optimized.

When I first got Cities Skylines in 2015 not long after it was released, I loved it, I played through a few campaigns (much longer than my marked hours because steam doesn't like to count offline hours) and they typically ran quite well until late game. In the past year or so, the game has been chugging just from the base plot, making it pretty much unplayable. My specs are all higher than the recommended. 

Don't play unless you're computer is a tank, in which case, enjoy and you won't regret your purchase but for now Collossal Order, we need to take a break.
I have played this for 33 hours at the time of writing this and got enough experience of building and taking care of a city That this is not a game you should get because AI for the game is literally useless, there is no way you can direct or set a area for a vehicle to go or not to go. (example: garbage trucks) saying that a garbage truck on one the map will go literally across your whole city. Demands for a type of building isn't realistic when all the buildings for that type hasn't have enough people employed. The Crematorium doesn't even do it's job right, people dying and moving out and the Crematorium is across the street. There's a lack of policies for districts also. Hopefully this saved you from buying this game and save some money to buy another game.
I would really like to recommend this game because it starts off great and the first couple of hours are a lot of fun.

Sadly, 'Cities: Skylines' quickly transforms into a traffic manager. Traffic is an absolute clusterfuck and is all you're gonna worry about after 5 hours with your city. And we're not talking metropolis here, a 50.000 pop city has so much traffic issues it's ridiculous.

Worst of all, this traffic manager has unfixable traffic if you want to build a realistic city. This means that you can forget about your plans of laying out your city the way you planned it which takes a lot of fun from the game. What you need to do is invest hours in trying out road patterns and grids, reading 1000 conflicting opinions on the Internet and finally ending up with some generic road pattern that you're gonna copy 50x times in order to be able to handle traffic with your growing city. If you don't that, traffic will utterly screw you.

Compared to traffic, all other issues and challenges an actual city faces pale in comparison. Ecology? Education? Crime? Just put a sewage system here, a university over here and a police station over there. Voila problem solved. But those cars are gonna get you.
lags horribly (might be my computer, but its the only game i have this sort of lag with), time only passes smoothly if im zoomed out all the way and viewing through traffic or electric mode, something with few colors.

 frequently 'loses' assets in the middle of game play, rendering saved cities unplayable.

the specific glitch i encounter most is the buildings being invisible in the game bar, which i worked around by just memorizing rough locations of buildings, and hovering over them to be sure, then clicking and placing. i got real good at knowing where the zone types were located, and could find the water pump AND drain buildings on my own, first try, felt very impressed with myself.

but then it just straight up deletes the entire tool bar when i go in and out to check my itunes, and no amount of restarting fixes it. only uninstalling the game, losing my saves, and reinstalling, just to face the same set of issues. its a great game but wow it feels like im playing a early access
I know many of you are very tech savvy players, but when I play a game, I really want it to be fun and moderately stress free. I have tried to be very conservative about the use of some of the highly subscribed, very nice  and highly rated mods that the community has developed, Which begs the question of why not just include them in the game at a reasonable cost as a patch!!!...My main concern is that this game constantly crashes without warning or reason.  Most of the time spent on this game consist of waiting on game uploads and recovering from more than the 20+ crashes that seems to be unique to this game alone, the other few games that I own play very well with mods and edits on this VERY powerful gaming computer that I own.  Cities Skyline could be my favorite game, If the game would allow me to play quality continuous minutes without crashing !!!!!!
 I am on the verge of giving up on this game and the developers, I am already warning my friends. Please help before I totally give up. I am exasperated!!!!!!! Thanks out there
Obtuse, boring, complicated but not difficult.  It plays like a mobile game padded out for PC.  Quite literally there are points in the game where wait a while is the best/only option for progression as you must rely on time to pass to generate money.  Honestly surprised there isn't a microtransaction store selling "time warps" for a $1 a piece.  Guides that PRAISE this game legit tell you to set up your city then run it in windowed mode while you're away to make money.  If that's the best way to play the game, the game is bad.

The city building part is only really a challenge in the beginning when the obtuse and ridiculous map designs require you to connect utilities on one side the map (sewage) to the highway entrance on the other side.  The issue is that it's so awkward that there's really only a couple real ways to do this meaning if you're playing for a challenge (that is you do NOT have infinite money on) you're stuck with the same one or two cookie cutter concepts to get a stable city early on.  After that the game ceases to be a city building simulator and beings to be a traffic simulator, with the only challenge being how do you route roads to keep things moving well enough.  The city planning aspects play little to no part at all as most everything is automatic and based on "hurry up and wait"

The core game is lackluster at best but as you get into it many many smaller flaws begin to show that takes it from mediocre to just bad.  The fact that things like parks must be built off a road.   The absolute lack of any kind of "smart" road building that leaves you relying on a trial and error method for building things like curves and circles.  Speaking of, the  fact there there's no native option to build basic shapes out of roads (an MS paint tier tool that lets you click and drag circles or squares would be massively helpful).  

I could go on but it would be pointless.  I dont like this game, it feels like a video game version of modern art, that is something bland and boring presented as interesting and deep by its fans to justify their sunk time.

A final note about modding.  The game is touted as being a wonderful platform for modders, and designed with modding in mind.  When Bethesda does just this its considered poor and lazy game development, why is it different here?  Why is it that basic functional structures that make the game infinitely more enjoyable to play are up to volunteers to make?   

The game truly feels like a rudimentary city building sim that was left unfinished then marketed as "mod friendly"


https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/#
One final (actually final) thought is that if the game were pitched as what it is, a sandbox city designer, I would be generally more positive about it.  Played as a sandbox city builder with unlimited money and everything unlocked really feels like how the game was intended to be played, with the "city builder" gameplay tacked on and sold as the main event.   If I was sold a game where I was told  the objective was to draw and design a city while the game generated assets and "life" into it I would be fine, but sold as a simulator where you're trying to build a city step by step, it's absolutely garbage.
Paradox ruined CK2, EU4, and Stellaris.  They will ruin this game too.  Uninstall so I don't emotionally invest into a city only to have base features stripped out and repackaged as DLC like they did with literally all three aforementioned titles.  If I were planning the city where Paradox Interactive are based, I'd surround their block with police stations and military bases because private security with military dropouts aren't going to be enough to protect them from victims of theft.  Because that's what it is when you release a product for a price and then rescind some of its base features -- theft of my money that I'd given them.  I wish so badly I could refund this game and block Paradox from my Steam account, but since I've exceeded the playtime limit, all I can do is warn you, the naive wallet-spreading gamer, away from supporting this league of reactionary sociopaths.
I've never been in a city or town without churches. This is a huge void in the game. Also, from an American perspective, people are not happy when you put bus stops next to their houses. This game has a lot of potential, but a few big flaws make the simulation unrealistic. Got it on sale so I'm satisfied, but the game would be greatly improved with community zoning that allows for the construction of churches, senior centers, homeless centers, etc.
