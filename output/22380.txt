[h1]Fallout: New Vegas.[/h1]
[i]The best true RPG of our lifetimes.[/i]
	
I should start out by saying; I am supremely biased. FNV was the first western RPG I had ever experienced when I got it on the Xbox 360 in early 2011, and since then I've played nearly 1,500 hours of it across 12 playthroughs of ~120 hours each. It is my favorite game of all time, but not necessarily because of nostalgia. Fallout: New Vegas has, to my mind, never been surpassed in its pairing of roleplaying [i]and[/i] narrative flexibility, by any game since its release - and I've played The Witcher 3, so you know this game must have something special. Therefore, that's what this review [i]must[/i] prove.

When you start a new game, most of everything you [i]need[/i] to know about the plot of New Vegas is laid out for you in one of Fallout's many iconic slideshows, but if you are entirely new to the franchise, I'd suggest clicking [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvqm_pPD-aQ]here.[/url] Otherwise, I'll just state that New Vegas is much more connected to the stories of Fallout's 1 & 2 than 3 or 4, due to it being set on the West Coast, and is in some ways a continuation of the story from Fallout 2. The rest, I'd rather not spoil. Although, in this specific Fallout... You are a courier, hired by the Mojave Express, to deliver a package to the New Vegas Strip. What seemed like a simple delivery job has taken a turn... for the worse.

Due to the fact that the only stipulation placed on the backstory of your character is that you were at one point in time a courier, the character you create can essentially be [i]anyone you want them to be.[/i] If you have the ability to coherently write a character, FNV becomes your own narrative playground; one of my favorite elements of the game. The character creation tools presented at the start of the game are suitably expansive as well; between skills, tags, and traits. Further progression in New Vegas is also superb, as you raise your skills accordingly and select from many game-altering, or at least useful, perks. Obviously, the character creation and progression in FNV is exemplary.

In FNV there is a plethora of dialogue, choices, consequences, and other roleplaying mechanics to be found. These systems all work together in perfect harmony, which puts real weight behind your actions. This could even mean small actions, such as stealing from some friendly wasteland townspeople who you know would suffer for it, as you are reminded of this by a reduction in karma. The dialogue system is especially of note though, as this is where most decisions are made, and where you express the personality of your character. There are always a stunning amount of choices you can make, and you'll never feel like a viable option was left out - in any situation. Many of your decisions even leave lasting effects on the Mojave, which I'll explain in greater detail later on.

New Vegas is well known for its intricately constructed faction system and politics, as you can choose from one of four main factions to end the game with, as well as affect nearly two dozen other minor factions - either by aiding or hindering them. Each organization has their own backstory and lore, and all of them have quest lines worth delving into. These groups will remember how you treat them, which builds a lasting relationship between them and the player. It's these dynamic factions that really bring the world to life through their thematic depth, and give the Mojave a lived-in feel.

Now that you have a sense of this game's successes, I'd like to highlight why it's my favorite game. Because of how incredibly detailed and lore-dense the Fallout series is, the jaw-dropping amount of narrative flexibility in New Vegas is what seals the deal for me. The ability to shape the Mojave as I see fit, a world that is so well realized, is unbelievably tantalizing to me; and I don't think any RPG has handled this better. It makes me feel like such a tour de force, that it's my character making these monumental decisions, and changing the future of a whole region - forever.

FNV takes place in the Mojave Wasteland, clearly, and the desolate design of this setting establishes a highly authentic apocalyptic atmosphere. I find the vanilla graphics to be timeless because of this, but mods can certainly modernize them. The region is a joy to explore too, as there are countless locations with pieces of environmental storytelling, quests, and loot within them. There's also an optional hardcore mode, which makes these barren wastes just that much harder to survive.

As a side note, I'll quickly state that almost every side-quest in New Vegas is spectacular. They were crafted with the utmost attention to detail, as they all have several ways to progress through them; and sincerely thoughtful writing applied to them. Each storyline has a distinct and often original motif, which makes them all a pleasure to play and experience.

Another important part of the game are the companions and characters, who all share one thing in common; purpose. Every follower has their own quests, backstories, and motivating factors that make them relatable to the player, and from even the most minor of (named) characters to the most important, everyone has identifiable personality traits. No one feels like wasted potential. These honest personas are what grounds your adventures in FNV, by making you truly care about the Mojave and its inhabitants.

Changing tone, Fallout: New Vegas' combat is fun, but also clunky. Shooting, stabbing, bludgeoning, disintegrating, and exploding your adversaries is what you'll spend most of your time doing when not exploring the wastes or having a pleasant chat, and this level of variety is where the strength of the combat lies. Just because it's clunky, doesn't mean there isn't visceral joy to be had. The V.A.T.S. system has also returned, but I don't personally use it. In essence the combat is just good enough to impress, but modding, which I'll mention later, can improve in considerably.

The biggest downfall of New Vegas is, undeniably, its performance. This is almost entirely the engine's fault; Bethesda have never been known for their technical aptitude in games creation - and Obsidian had to make do. Minor bugs run rampant, as well as crashes if you don't make necessary tweaks to the .ini files, which you can look up to discover what I'm talking about. The game also stutters often, but mods can alleviate this issue for the most part. My advice would be to save often, and install a few mods, which is the next topic.

One of the greatest parts about Fallout: New Vegas, and the post-Fallout 3 series in general, is its customizability. Anything from simple fixes to new quests, and visual overhauls to gameplay tweaks can be added to the game, and to do this I'd recommend the [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/?]FNV Nexus.[/url] I'd suggest watching some tutorials on how to mod the game, and from there NVSE, NVSR, NVAC, and Project Nevada are all essential mods as far as I'm concerned, but it's up to you. Visual mods are also welcome, however they're subjective so I won't recommend any here. All considered; [i]modding[/i]: a useful skill for any FNV player.

I hope I've made my case as to why this is my favorite game clear. It's not the best at everything it does, but what it does do correctly is simply exactly what I want from a game. The roleplaying, decision making, characters, world, lore, narrative - and so much more, just binds together into such a cohesive package of everything I ask for from an open world RPG, that I can't resist it's call. And, if I remember correctly (but of course I do, I could never forget), it sounds a little like this...

10/10 Best Fallout plot
[h1]Fallout: New Vegas, is it for you?[/h1]

If you are considering picking this game up, but not sure if you'll like it, here are some things I liked and disliked.

[u]What I liked:[/u]
[*]Character Customization:
The amount of character customization is really up there. Virtually unlimeted posibilities when making a character. (Not as much as TES: Skyrim, but really close).
[*]Mod Support:
The modding community is very expansive for a game that has been out sinse Oct, 23 2010. If you can think of something, it probably exist!
[*]Open World:
Depending on what version you buy (Standard or Ultamite edition), you will have plenty to do. Sights to see, things to shoot! 
[*]Weaponry: 
Fallout: New Vegas is full of many types of weapons. Everything from M4 carbines to helicopter propeller swords! But don't forget that there are mods for anything you desire.
[*]Hardcore Mode:
Want something more realistic to a real life apocolypse? Well Fallout: New Vegas has a "Hardcore" mode you!
[*]Multiple Playthroughs:
There's not just one way to experience New Vegas, but four ways!

[u]What I disliked:[/u]
[*]Crashing:
Fallout: New Vegas will crash on you at least once or twice. Whenever it does it can be anouying having to go back and redo quest that you've completed.
[*]Navmesh:
Despite the occasional crash, the navmesh in this game works, but is a little sloppy. Sometimes NPCs will walk into walls and furniture. But it is easliy overlooked when you get further into the game. (You may even find it funny)
[*]PC abilities:
This game is not the most demanding game for a PC, but can effect your overall experience of it. (I.E. glitching, FPS drops, and crashes)

[b]So what's the difference between the standard edition and the ultimate edition?[/b]
     The ultimate edition is the standard game, but with all of the DLC will it. Yes it cost an extra $10.00 but is worth it compared to buying the standard edition for $9.99 and all the DLC for $22.94.  

[i]All-in-all:[/i]
Fallout: New Vegas is a good solid game for the money. You'll find yourelf captivated by it's charm and want to play evenmore of it. It does get a little dull after a while, but does have a fantastic modding community. I would purchase the Ultimate Edition instead of the Standard, just my opinion. Steam does have The GECK in the tools section which will allow you to make mods for the game.
✧ Easy Steps on How to Play Fallout: New Vegas ✧ 
1.) set luck to 10
2.) find the nearest casino
3.) play the slots or blackjack
4.) make dolla dolla bills
5.) get kicked out
6.) Rinse and repeat at every other casino till there's no place left
7.) Sit on your piles of thousands of caps and proceed to spend it on nothing

I give this game a 10/10

edit: this review blew up and i'd just like to say i broke this game from mods after 100 hrs

Ave, true to New Vegas.
The Wild West meets the Fallout Post Apocalyptic world and a great game is born.

Fallout: New Vegas is an open world RPG set in a Post Apocalyptic world. Where Fallout 3 was set in D.C. this game is set the Mojave desert around the ruins of old Las Vegas. The theme throughout this game is a western one, but many different factions are present, each with their own unique (and often hilarious) style. And of course there is a power stuggle between a pre-war industrialist, Caesers legion and the New California Republic is under way and you are about to be thrown into the middle of it. What will you do?

This game is filled with great characters, hilarious dialogue and so many entertaining quests that it would be hard to do them all in a single play through. The DLC adds many more hours of fun although it is quite varied in flavour and in value, but all of them are worth playing at least once. The exception might be Lonesome Road, which most people loved but I had some issues with, especially with one decision it forces you to take that I felt was not one any of my characters would ever have made. But Old World Blues may be my favourite DLC for any game ever. The first fifteen minutes had me crying with laughter. 

When you add the fact that the modding communty is adding more of everything, this game could provide several hundred hours of play time and still have things to offer.  If you are interested in modding the PC version of this game, and you should be, then check out my tutorials on how to do exactly that: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-3c1a9cLL8&index=1&list=PL0E5E8CA384409B11

Fallout: "I need to find a water chip."
Fallout 2: "I need to find a G.E.C.K."
Fallout 3: "I need to find my father."
Fallout 4: "I need to find my son."
Fallout: New Vegas: "Now where is that dumb motherf**ker who shot me in the head?"
One of my all-time favourite games, I really enjoyed it and I spent many, many hours playing this. The huge amount of choices, factions and playstyles the game gives you, makes you want to experience every single one. The story may be a bit weak and the graphics a bit rusty (same engine as Fallout 3). This is however beaten by an awesome gameplay (modable weapons!), a brilliant atmosphere set in sin city, nevada and its surroundings and also 4 high quality DLCs (I strongly recommend Lonesome Road, because of its story and revelations).
"They asked me how well I understood theoretical physics. I said I had a theoretical degree in physics. They said welcome aboard."

Every character in this game is so well written it's incredible.
A very fun game, there's so much to explore and it's easy to immerse in this world. 
Masterpiece.
I absolutely loved Fallout: New Vegas it had me smiling and enjoying my experience the entire time!

[h1] GAMEPLAY [/h1]
     Fallout: New Vegas is rich with content for you to enjoy, a wide array of weapons and weapon mods to go with them, to several different ways to approach the story! The combat in Fallout: NV is very fun, just because there are so many ways to destroy your enemies in the game along with V.A.T.S makes it very fun to see kills in slow motion. 
    Leveling up in this game is also fun, there are tons of perks and different skills that determine which perks are available. This makes the game have lots of replayability.

     There are tons of diverse locations for you to explore in the Mojave, although alot of the land between them feels empty and weak.  The game will even reward you for exploring these side areas, from a certain vault's equipment room to much more, it feels natural.

    The game will also introduce a reputation system, basically the karma system but for each individual faction in the game, the factions which are also fantastic and even an old friend will come to see you from FO1.
  
     This along with lots of side activities in Vegas such as gambling, such as Blackjack and Roulette which can be very rewarding with high luck stat. Alot more side quests are available once you get to New Vegas as well!

[h1] STORY [/h1]
     While the story in this game may feel a bit cliche at first, it definately gets more interesting later on, as the characters you meet in the story are memorable. That with the multiple endings and choices you have in the story, add to the games replay value alot!  

[h1] AUDIO & MUSIC [/h1]
     The sound design for the weapons and creatures are very well done, as with the music and the radio are also fun to listen, many scores from Fallout's soundtrack can be heard in NV, such as "Metallic Monks" giving a great sense of nostalgia to any classic fallout player!

[h1] GRAPHICS [/h1]
     Fallout: New Vegas uses the same graphics engine as Fallout 3, which may seem a bit dated now, but it still can give lots of beautiful shots with the landscape of the Mojave Desert. The game and graphics run very well on new and older PCs alike. You should have no problem running this game!

[h1] OVERALL [/h1]
     All together Fallout: New Vegas recieves a [h1]9/10[/h1] from me, it's a great game with very high replay value, along with a decent story. Obsidian did a fantastic job with this game!
It looked old when it was released. Now it's downright ugly. The gunplay is clunky. The physics are terrible. The bugs are ever present.

The RPG mechanics are top notch. The choices you make matter.

One of the greatest games ever made.
Fallout: Where's that chip?
Fallout 2: Where's the G.E.C.K
Fallout 3: Where's my dad?
Fallout 4: Where's my son?

*Fallout NV*
WHERE'S THAT MOTHERFUCKER WHO SHOT ME IN THE HEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!

In Fallout you were a vault dweller
In Fallout 2 you were the chosen one
In fallout 3 you were the lone wanderer
And this this you become the most badass of them all...

The God damm mailman
Sure it crashes.

Sure it's buggy.

Sure the end game is rushed.

But by god, everytime I want to experience a real RPG game and get myself really immersed in something I will always come back to this. Even with its petty 18 months dev time with an outdated engine it is still a better game than Fallout 4, I cannot recommend this enough! 


[Speech 95/65] You should buy the game, it`s worth it.
[Terrifying Presence] If you don't buy this game, i will make sure you never see the light of the day again.
[Barter] This great game for this low, low price?! You can't pass a opportunity like this, my friend.
[Intelligence] I have calculated the chance of you not having fun in this game. It's lower than 1%.
[Low Intelligence] You buy pizza warm game for big fun.
[Confirmed Bachelor] You know, this game makes your penis ten times bigger.
[Explosives 35/15] How about game or boom?
<Lie> This game sucks.
The last true Fallout title. Some criticise the pacing, or the lack of cannon fodder between set pieces, but this is an RPG first, and an action game second, and it excels as an RPG. The story is multidimensional and actually responds to your decisions. The companions are more than just packmules with stock responses to various cues.  The lore is respected, and honored with well-thought-out throwbacks and limited fan-service. This game isn't an action-packed murder maze through linear coridors and mutant-filled arenas. Most of your time will be spent on your own, in hauntingly lonely areas, but all the while, theres a lingering feeling that the eyes of world's game changers are upon you.
A few reasons why I love this game.
1. The roads are the dustiest.
2. The winds are the gustiest.
3. The gates are the rustiest.
4. The pies are the crustiest.
5. The songs are the lustiest
6. The friends are the "trustiest"
Bethesda claims they worked on Fallout 4 for 5 years, 5 year they had to get it right, 5 years they had to review the orginal 2 games and maybe get help from the creators, 5 fucking years and a toned down, gutted fallout game is what we got, lifeless soulless, only thing that was better where the visuals and added crafting, in 2009 Bethesda says to Obsidan "we want you to make a Fallout game, you have 18 months." 1 year and 6 months later this game came out and destroyed Fallout 3, actual RPG mechanics, memorable charecters, and factions that diffrent people can join because they suit their choices for the wasteland. Bethesda said Obsidan will not make another game because they didn't get an 85 on the game from critics (they got an 84) but deep down their embarassed that this game still holds up after 8 years and puts Fallout 4 and will put F76 to shame
The 'real' Fallout 3 to a lot of members in the community, Fallout: New Vegas picks up where Fallout 1 and 2 left off by continuing to expand upon developments on the Western Coast of the United States in a post-apocalyptic world. The New California Republic is back, as is the Brotherhood and Enclave (or what remains of it). Veterans of the franchise will notice a few subtle nods to previous games in the franchise, such as Poseidon Energy and a few characters coming from locales in Fallout 1 and 2.

Unlike Fallout 3, New Vegas maintains consistency in its lore with previous titles in the franchise. The Brotherhood is a reclusive organization rather than an army of ''do-gooders', the Enclave isn't the powerful organization it once was, and Super Mutants aren't all over the place for no reason. It's no surprise that the creators of Fallout : NV are also the minds behind Fallout 1 and 2, before the studio closed and Bethesda bought out the franchise. The post-apocalyptic world is still fresh in their minds and care was applied when creating the world and lore so that it meshes with previous entries.

New to this entry is the faction system. Whereas Fallout 3 automatically made the Brotherhood the 'good guys' and you only had one choice in the ending (tamper with the Purifier or not), New Vegas lets you side with one of four factions, affecting the New Vegas power struggle and the ending. Whomever you decide to side with, they carry their own mainline quests to win control of the Hoover Dam. The faction system also carries it's own subset of reputation; a faction may despise you (attacking you on sight) or idolize you. Reputation is gained or lost by finishing quests for a faction and/or siding with them when presented with the option. When doing the mainline quests for a faction, you'll slowly lose karma with the others until you're attacked by them on-sight.

Whilst siding with a faction for an ending is excellent, don't place too much thought on juggling reputations whilst exploring and doing sidequests. Whilst exploring the Mojave, its in your best interest to side with the NCR when presented with the option; they have camps all over the map, they account for at least 25% of all sidequests (estimate) and a potential companion (and his quest) requires NCR fame. The only factions you'll have to juggle rep with outside of the main quest arcs are the Legion and NCR, all other factions have peaceful resolutions if presented with an issue between the two of them. Most of the time it'll be a question of whether or not to fu*k over the Legion, since the quest will come from an NCR official. The Legion has ONE camp in the game (the other reached through the storyline), and no sidequests so always side against them. Don't worry, there's a point in the main storyline where negative rep is reset with either the Legion or NCR (or both), allowing you to do all sidequests and then side with the Legion in the main story.

So it's a coin toss: either you appreciate the ability to do all sidequests in a single playthrough without having to worry too much about factions and reputation (which I believe), or you believe the system failed since it's effect outside of the main story quest arcs is non-existant. Perhaps the Brotherhood and Followers should've fought more, perhaps concurrent sidequests between two factions should've been introduced, forcing you to balance reputations. Or maybe you aren't a fan of having to play through a game multiple times, especially when you invested a ton of hours into one playthrough. 

What is clear is that the Legion, despite being an important faction in the game, has VERY little representation in the game. This is due to time constraints: with only 18 months in development Obsidian had to leave everything east of the Colorado River an unexplorable area, originally being Legion territory. There's also an entire western portion of the map blocked off by mountains, and the north eastern end of the map as well. The game also has a significantly lower amount of interiors (buildings you can go into) as compared to Fallout 3, and the Mojave wasteland is littered with meaningless locations (abandoned shacks, empty areas with no interiors). You don't have to look too far to see time constraints everywhere. All to the game's detriment: I would've preferred more interiors with PC terminals and notes delving into inhabitants lives or situations around the Mojave.

Fallout 3 did exploration better: more interiors and towns. But Fallout NV does everything else better: lore, story, writing. Fallout NV is more of a Fallout title than Fallout 3 was, and if you're a fan of the franchise you'll love the care Obsidian put in handling its congruity with the other titles. If you really can't be bothered and are only interested in exploring, then Fallout 3 might be higher on your list. Whatever the case, NV's short development cycle and the quality of the end product is a testament to how skilled and dedicated Obsidian is to the franchise. Thumbs up, loved it more than FO3.
I just actually spent 5 days on a road trip to Zion National Park with friends, because we were inspired to do so by this very game.

To review Fallout 3 or New Vegas is a difficult challenge. Not because their content is too hard but their expectations of what players want to enjoy are different. While seemingly similar in their mechanics, both games diverge in what players expect to enjoy in a "Fallout" game. 

If you have read my review of Fallout 3, then you know I consider New Vegas the more refined game. Traits, player-choice influenced quest-lines, the faction systems, and the gray morality are important factors for what makes NV so great. However, it's the world-building that puts NV as one of the finest examples of open-world games. 

As someone who has thought of open-world games as the death of narratives from the Ubisoft games to the missed opportunities of games like Risen, Obsidian has forever changed my opinion on their storytelling merits. NV doesn't tell the greatest story nor the smartest; it tells a world of tales of your interactions that shape the Mojave one grain of sand at a time.

[h1]Nuka Cola or Sunset Sarsaparilla?[/h1]

Before I discuss the importance of NV's strongest suit, I do want to go over the improvements of NV. Many fans I think will consider liking F3 or NV to be something similar to the question, "Coke or Pepsi?"

While both games are mechanically the same, there are noticeable differences. For example, F:NV focuses more-so on the role-playing mechanics by making its perks more unique, sometimes beneficial with consequences or adding a new level of challenge. F3 simply focuses on numbers and how to make them better. I found that by Lv 43 my character in NV still had room for growth whereas my F3 character was maxed out before LV 13.

Quests in NV seem more shorter and to the point than F3. (Admittedly, the travel time between each quest could be the reason for why they feel more brief in NV.) The Mojave is a more compacted, content-rich area than D.C. which might be great to some (like me) and a negative to others. What NV makes up for instead is how questlines can feed into other quests seemlessly by the player's exploration and choices.

Even when it comes to the FPS mechanics, the iron-sights, weapon mods and various ammo types for every gun make the barebones gunplay of F3 much more tolerable. (I find the repair/ammo-crafting benches too restricting on junk to ever warrant using them.) I hardly ever use VATS in F3 or NV unless I want to get headshots on Deathclaws.

Speaking of Deathclaws, enemies in NV are not leveled to the player from the get-go. They are given a fixed level—and scaling later—which makes enemies more consistent in NV. This change does come at the cost of making the early part of NV more linear as you have to loop around the road to get to Vegas as your first major quest-goal. However, like in Risen, the game tells you this through the enemies' difficulty and there are quests/paths along a more linear beginning than F3.

I personally prefer the grim-humor flavor of the post-post apocalypse of the Mojave over the post-apocalypse consistency of D.C. Your taste may vary, but I hope to explain why NV is the superior game.

[h1]It's All A Matter of Context[/h1]

If you have played a Bethesda game before, then you will more often notice a problem of its open-world design: The world always feels disjointed. 

Quests in Bethesda games have been focused on telling individual stories with little to no relation to one another. Tone-shifts, relevance to the over-arching storyline, and other narrative pitfalls suffer as a result. While some fans may enjoy this format, the result is a world that feels more lifeless by their lack of context.

Fallout 3's main-questline is indicative of this problem. You go from exploring the Museum of Natural History to get a radar dish for a DJ, to wandering to a city made of a shipwrecked vessel to learn about your father's science project, then exploring a Vault with a murder-simulation program, and then later stumbling upon a society of children. 

In contrast, NV begins with the town of Goodsprings caught up in the much larger conflict of the Legion encroaching upon the NCR claimed settlements of the Mojave. A gang of escaped convicts harass the people of Goodsprings who have stolen their explosives from the NCR mining outpost of Sloan to exert their power. (The result being that the explosions have lured out Deathclaws along the road of Sloan.) This gang has taken the town of Primm under their rule as they fight off the NCR stationed there, and the gang's other settlement Nipton is under attack by the Legion.

As seen in this one example, conflicts in New Vegas feed back into each other and expand upon the world it tells. This description of events is simply the background window-dressing to your actions as you can side with Goodsprings, the convict gangs, the NCR or the Legion. Your interactions stay within the story's guidelines of NV. Questlines also can link-back up with previous or new areas, and the order of these quests can be stories you create for yourself (ex. Jacobtown and Black Mountain).
	
What can also be seen in this one example is the careful attention to details. Why are Deathclaws roaming Sloan? Why are the NCR defending Primm/Goodsprings? Even in its environmental design, there is a level of detail of the farming area of Goodspring to explain how a town can survive. Something that was utterly lacking in Fallout 3.

The reward from all of this attention to detail is that the world of NV feels more alive than it actually is because the world makes sense. Are there still tone-shifts or missing details? Yes, especially with the cringe-worthy sexual tensions and swear-words. However, these moments are far less abundant and offer a dark sense of humor in a post-post apocalypse.
 
[h1]"I've Got Heartaches by the Number"[/h1]

I would be lying if I said I thought NV is absolutely perfect. 

While I praise the game's means of storytelling and of player-choices in the overall game there are some downsides that I think some people may enjoy. It took me years to be stubborn enough to play to Vegas because I was so used to F3's freeform exploration.

The narrative hook of NV is not one to keep you invested if you don't care to learn more about the conflicts around the Mojave. Even then, the plot of the Courier is very sparse and not very personal. (On the otherhand, the freeform nature of the Courier lets you make him/her be whoever you want.)

The rushed schedule of the game has had some impact on its development. F3's engine has really shown its age with how much NV has to restrict itself, whether it be the barren New Vegas or the amounts of gated loading screens. Not only are aspects like this have to be rushed but even some interactions aren't coded in.

For example, when trying to set a truce between the NCR and the Brotherhood of Steel, if you had gotten rid of the previous Elder then the option for truce does not exist. It's not that the new one is arrogant and won't agree to it--the game is not programmed to understand that option. These type of instances are very, very, very rare but they are a stain on the freeform nature of the game. 

On the flipside, it is really telling how much trust Obsidian has with its player when the game has one--and only one--unkillable NPC, the Yes Man (aside from children and Victor in the early part of the game). Fallout 4 is littered with these unkillable NPCs while New Vegas offers multiple optional objectives/paths for almost every quest. 

If Obsidian was given more time to flesh out the game and on a better engine, then I think this game would be a perfect masterpiece. (In spite of its somewhat lackluster personal narrative.) Instead, it's a masterpiece with a few smudges you have to accept.

With all these gripes being said... [i]the day I stop counting that's the day my world will end.[/i]
Fallout 1: need to find a chip
Fallout 2: need to save my village!
Fallout 3: Where is Dad
Fallout 4: Where is Shaun!
Fallout NV: IM GONNA KILL YOU BENNY!
After many playthroughs, I still can't decide which faction to side with. This is my take though, for anyone interested.

NCR:
+- Old world values, god bless America (?).
+ Gender equality, arguably even more than in the old world. Treated equally as soldiers and leaders.
+ Idealists. The President's speech is pretty heartwarming even though it's deceiving and fueled by lies.
- Overextension, their obsession with controlling everything leads to them being utterly incompetent at every front.
- Greed, they take what they want, planned to annex New Vegas for their own benefit, never mind Mr. House or the locals.
- Corruption. As Caesar puts it, they are a "loose conglomerate of individuals looking out for themselves".

Legion:
+- Ancient rome, with all the benefits and drawbacks that brings.
+ Ideological purity, "the will of Caesar is the will of the Legion". Caesar brings "the torch of knowledge" to the wastes.
+ Impressively competent. In a few decades Caesar formed a power to rival the NCR, that's built over several generations.
- Child soldiers, implied by Ranger Andy. Kind Of unnerved by that one. Never seen ingame, but it'd never pass legally.
- Women are "property" and "below notice". If you're a female courier, they'll comment on "trying you out". Stranger Danger.
- Extremely unforgiving, ends justify the means. Crucifixion, massacres, terrorism. All for the "greater good", a Legion rule.

Mr. House:
+ An immortal supercomputer man machine god. If you're a fan of the world of Asimov, maybe you'd prefer his rule.
+ "An economic and technological visionary". His own smug words, though many sources confirm him as a genius.
+ Long term plan for humanity, says he'll have people in space searching for new worlds in a century.
- Autocratic, claims answering to a board of directors would only impede progress. Perhaps not a typical tyrant, but practically.
-+ Immortal leader, infinite term. He'd probably never let go of power were he to completely acquire it.
- He's human, despite the machines he surrounds himself with. Likely he'd get bored. Corrupt. Sociopathic. Terrifying. just look at what happened to the courier once you gave him multiple playthroughs, more than one lifetime.

Independent, Yes Man:
+-A complete wildcard. It'd depend too much on the courier to be completely generalized in pros and cons. Still...
- As general Oliver said, NCR would be angered. You'd be caught between NCR and Legion, and that securitron army doesn't really replenish or grow unless a way to make more was found.

Currently, I'm leaning towards the Legion. The world of fallout doesn't need the casinos, prostit***s, the chemed-up and drunken old world shadow of New Vegas. A cleansing of Vegas is completely in order. Plus, with the legion finally getting its rome, perhaps Caesar could start implementing the non-warlike aspects of the roman empire, and really establish a pax romana. Playing as a female courier means that a coin of her would be minted and spread across his empire. In time, that might bring some level of equality, being honored next to Caesar himself, just as Tandi being honored is thought to have brought equality to the NCR. The courier wouldn't have to be a devil, but by being fair and good hearted in all dealings might easen the transition of legion rule over Vegas and make it somewhat more endurable. If nothing else, perhaps it will cause the NCR to shape up a bit. 

On second thought, nah. Wild Card all the way. If I want things done right I'll do it myself.

Oh, and the game's writing is terrific. Gameplay's pretty swell too.
You can f**k  a robot
You can send zombies into outer space
You can sell your friends to be eaten by cannibals
You can speak in grunts if your character is an idiot
You get an achievement for beating a 200 year old to death with a golf club
You can f**k the guy who shot you in the head (if you're a lady pc)
You can perform brain surgery on a roman emperor cosplayer by having high luck
10/10 best game
1. Take Fallout 3
2. Improve faces and animations
3. Improve writing and record thousands more lines
4. Hire real voice actors and celebrities
5. Make unique country western soundtrack instead of ripping off previous entries soundtracks
6. Add in a goosebump-inducing intro cutscene and engaging tutorial
7. Add in factions with reputation systems
8. Add gambling minigames
9. Add new enemies
10. Overhaul perks to create a unique playstyle for any character (Rather than +5 to melee)
11. Add a crafting system to customize medicine, ammo, weapons, chems, and hides
12. Make barter relevant
13. Add dozens of unique weapons and armor in a minor DLC
14. Add 4 immensely satisfying DLCs, the outcome and execution of which are strongly influenced by dialogue options
15. Flesh out companions, giving them quests, unique behaviors, romance options, and branching dialogue
16. Add in a survival mode, supported by harvesting/crafting beverages and food across the map and getting sleep
17. Wala, it is New Vegas
By far one of the greatest RPGs ever made. 

Pros:
Made by members of the original Fallout team
Allows for a level of roleplay that is simply not possible in any other Fallout game. 
A variety of intruiging factions all competing across the Mojave. 
Choices that actually matter and have lasting effects throughout the playthrough, as opposed to a simple morality choice like in Fallout 3. 
Improves the shooting from Fallout 3 by adding iron sights. 
Naturally builds on the lore established by Fallout 1 and 2 instead of retconning and twisting it like the Bethesda Fallouts.
Great build potential where almost anything can be viable
You can kill literally every character in the game and you can still beat it, nobody is set essential. 

Cons:
Unfortunately quite buggy
Console limitations forced the developers to limit the scope of some areas
Caesar's Legion is not as fleshed out as it was originally going to be
Visually not good for a 2010 game
Most of these can be fixed with mods

Truly a fantastic game I recommend to any fan of video games. Will never get a sequel thanks to Bethesda's continued dumbing down of the series.
I'm going to Rewrite my Fallout: New Vegas review because my old one was monkey ass.

Fallout: New Vegas is in my top 5 favorite games of all time, and definitely my favorite post-apocolyptic world. Its one of the best open world games available and I can't recommend it more, full price or not. This is truely one of the greatest games of the last generation, and of all time. 

I played over 100 hours of FNV on my PS3, before I became a PC gamer. I've now put in 55 additional hours and I'm still not done with it. I'm not even close to playing through the amazing mods, and quests this game has. There is easily over 100 hours of content, without replaying any of it. Its absolutely unreal how much content is in this game and how fun it is to play it all.

The Story of FNV starts with you getting shot in the head. Pretty weird start, but it works, it makes me interested. Why did I get shot? Who shot me? Why did he shoot me over [SPOILER DELETED]? You find all this out over the course of the story, that plays itself out greatly. On top of an indepth main quest, you have detailed side quests to go along with it. The side quests do a great job of tying the story together while also telling its own. I don't want to go on forever here, but if you want comparisons, the story in FNV is exponentially better than the story in Fallout 3. And I enjoyed the story in Fallout 3 quite a bit. 

The combat system works in an interesting way. While you do have the basic FPS mechanics, you also have VATS, which makes it work in sort of a psuedo-Turn based way. You target certain body parts, tell your guy to shoot, then he does. Its pretty satisfying, especially seeing an opponents head go flying in pieces off of his body. Pretty satisfying combat. I do wish sniping was done a bit better, I feel like when I'm trying to snipe opponents from far away, VATS doesn't really want to cooperate, which is unfortunate. Pretty much my only complaint about the combat. This last part isn't really about combat, but it is gameplay so I'll mention it here. The game implements a hardcore mode, which forces you to eat, sleep and drink along with making combat more difficult and companions killable. I've never done a full hardcore playthrough, but I do enjoy the mode for the most part. Killable companions is bullshit though, I use a mod to keep that part off.

This is getting really long, so I'll make my last point about the world. This is probably the major weakness of the game, if I was to point out any. I don't really think there is anything majorly wrong with the world, but at the beginning it sort of feels like you can only go one way. If you try to go north, you're almost guarenteed to get slaughtered, unless you turn god mode on. Mid level(about level 15) and on, you can pretty much go anywhere in the world and you don't have to worry about dying. The world feels good and exploration is fun, but it definitely feels like its forcing a linear path for the first 1/4 of the main quest.

Fallout: New Vegas is my favorite Single player FPS of all time, and if you've never played this gem, you should pick it up immediately. I promise, you'll love it.

The fact that this game has Roman ISIS, the US government (Light version, but with Forrest Gump), Space Marines, Howard Hughes with a Robot Fetish, The entire cast of Toy Story 2, paranoid people with artillery (BAD COMBINATION), Mongolian Biker Gangs, a Robot with a crush on you, and an army of Elvis Presleys should be enough for most people to buy it.

But seriously, FO:NV is a great game with a great story and great gamplay. 
Also great mods

11/10 would crash the game again.
To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip
"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip"

In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more

Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red

Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death

There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip

Big iron, big iron,
Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
Where do I even begin? Fallout 3 is a good game. Fallout 4 is (more or less) a good game. But Fallout New Vegas...it takes the cake.

I've sank countless hours into this on PC and the Xbox. This game is superb. While I know a lot of people disagree, I honestly think this is a game everyone should try at least once.
I chased Matthew Perry across the Mojave after he shot me in the face. Along the way, I met ex-convicts with a fetish for dynamite, Roman cosplayers, a dinosaur salesman in an even bigger dinosaur, a cult of zombies who want to go to space, an army of cowboys and grunts, a robotic prostitute and a gang of Elvis impersonators. Upon reaching Matthew Perry, I shot him in the face twice so I didn't make the same mistake he did.
Hands down the best game I've ever played. I almost love it more than I love my family.

[i] "Three crippled limbs, haven't slept in four days, no ammo left and hunted by the Legion. But atleast my spurs go Jingle, Jangle, Jingle.﻿" [/i]

It's a perfect RPG with a perfect amount of everything you want. Unlike Fallout 4, you actually have more than 4 choices of dialogue, and the ability to make up your own story. I usually end up using revolvers and repeaters, since I'm pretty much obsessed with cowboys. The amount of really good side quests is incredible. Some of them are even more interesting than the entire story of Fallout 4. Although, in my opinion it is easier to gain playtime in Fallout 4. 

What about the DLC's? The DLC's, well, they are as amazing as you'd expect from Obsidian. Honest Hearts my favorite, since I love the landscape of Utah and [spoiler]the story of the Burned Man.[/spoiler] 
Old World Blues however, made me laugh as much as I have never laughed at a game before.
Lonesome Road and Dead Money? They are gold aswell (literally). 

The soundtrack is the best. Ever. I've been listening to the music from day 1 since I got the game, and I know the lyrics to most, if not all the songs. It's quite surprising how you won't get tired of them. Also, Mr. New Vegas. It's impossible not to love him. <3

How about factions, do they beat the Brotherhood of Steel or The Institute?
Hell fucking yes, any day, any time. The conflict between the NCR and Ceasar's Legion is far more interesting and immersive than the BoS vs Institute thing. I'm a bit of an NCR patriot myself, heheh. [spoiler] Never been a fan of lynching and burning people alive. [/spoiler]

[i]"Crashes by the number,
Glitches by the score,
Everyday you love me less,
Each day I love you more." [/i]

Let's talk about mods. Oh, lovely mods. If you're getting a Fallout because of the mods, this is the one for you. You can (and should) customize your game entirely using them. I'm running 100+ mods now and it's not even that much. The problem is getting the game to work with all of them though, it can be pretty frustrating.

New Vegas is nostalgically depressing but it's surprisingly a great feeling.﻿

So, should you put 60 dollars into buying a failed Fallout game or spend 20 bucks on one of the best games ever made? The choice is up to you. I'd get this game though.


Edit #1
Please, vote for this game to win the "Test of Time" award. Obsidian deserves it.
In the Wastes of the Mojave rode a stranger one fine day
Spoke to all the folks around him; he had lots of things to say
with two bullets in the brain and armed with his pip
the stranger was a looking for that missing platinum chip
Missing platinum chip

It was early in the morning when he rode into Freeside
Local Thugs there tried to kill him, but all those men then died
passed the robots by the gate, he made his way onto the Strip
for the stranger was a looking for a missing platinum chip
Missing platinum chip

In New Vegas lived the Chairman, former tribals in the Tops
Amongst them there was Benny, who was calling all the shots
It was he who shot stranger, left him buried in the dirt
the stranger feeling vengeful, was about to make him hurt
about to make him hurt

The stranger chased down Benny, but the outlaw got away
In his stead, the robot Yesman, was about to change the day
He told the Stranger if he helps him, he can rule over the Strip
but first please track down Benny and that missing platinum chip
Missing platinum chip

Wasn't long before the Stranger got involved with all out war
The NCR they held the dam but the bull was by their door
Caesars legion caught hold of Benny, and with the chip now in their hands
the stranger started thinking about their potential plan
their potential plan

On the one hand there was Caesar, and his mighty legionaries
As Organized and they were deadly, they were killers of the Bear
but their cruelty and their malice made them questionable at best
Would the Stranger side with Caesar and bring terror to the west
terror to the west

The folks of California, known as the NCR
from the town of Shady Sands, their power has come far
they claim to bring democracy for the lands that they possess
but their corruption and dirty dealings created civil unrest
created civil unrest

Finally a third option and leave Vegas all alone
He could drive out the warring armies and claim Vegas as his own
with Yesman, the Stranger could solely rule the lands
or redistribute the power to Mr House's hands
Mr House's hands

The stranger made theirs choices and the Mojave it did change
some decisions were made with reason, but others were really strange
but what became of the stranger, and their vault tec pip
well we know they found a way, to get that platinum chip
they found the platinum chip﻿

11/8 plot

P.S. Thx to Odysseus for telling me how stupid I am and making the review accurate
As a uneducated chicken nugget I played fallout 4 first but I see my mistake now I never played any other game in the franchise and I can see why fallout New Vegas is regarded as the best in the series the city of sin reborn into the wasteland I love everything about this game from the gambling,the factions,the neon lights of new Vegas,and the story the game has to offer.Even if obsidian reused the models of fallout 3 everything this game has overshadows that.I would recommend this to anyone who has never heard of the fallout franchise or even anyone who played fallout 4 and is a uneducated chicken nugget.
Ring-A-Ding-Ding
Fallout New Vegas -- The game held together by paperclips and rubber bands, but man is it charming and does it manage to impress me every time.

Take my money Obsidian.
This game is way better than [i]Fallout 4[/i]. I enjoy the leveling system, karma system, the unique perks, choices that matter, having your speech skill to a certain level add more dialogue options, you can kill anyone you want, the list goes on. In my eyes this game is the whole package. This is a Fallout game done right.

I'm giving this a 'Recommended' review because this is a great Fallout game compared to it's sequel. However, I keep experiencing frequent crashes. I have to save every 20 minutes because I'm worried my game will crash at any moment, causing me to replay certain events I rather not if I forget to save. Relying on auto save is a no go because if you enter an area where it's the main reason for your unexpected crash then be ready to reload the last manual save you did an hour ago and re-live it again. Was able to complete the main quest by the way.

[b]BEWARE THE CRASHES.[/b]
Characters: Intriguing
Story: Intriguing
Plot: Intriguing
DLC: Intriguing
Optimization: Could use some work
Modding Community: Still alive (lol)

[b]GAME:[/b] Definitely the best Fallout game I've ever played AND one of the best RPGs out there

CONCLUSION: [i]This game's aged well, and still well worth your money![/i]
Fallout: New Vegas may well be one of the greatest games I have ever played.
The twisted tale of factions, each with their own goals and interests, all co-existing in a beautifully designed world. It managed to feel open, yet constrained. I had things to do, but nobody to force me to do them. A true masterpiece of a roleplaying game.

----------------------------------

I'm writing this not ten minutes after finishing my first playthough, which lasted nearly 40 hours. 40 hours of time well spent, and I am preparing for my next playthrough. No other game has had me this excited to repeat it. I suppose that's good. Most games I play, well, they get one pass. One shot. One game. Then I relegate them to the "Played" category.

Not Fallout: New Vegas

Though it has been finished, this masterpiece retains a spot atop my Favorites list. How? Let's get into that.

----------------------------------

Fallout: New Vegas opens with an iconic scene. The courier (you, the player) is caught by a stranger. It's time to cash out. You've made your last delivery kid. Truth is, the game was rigged from the start. You might know those lines. I did skip a few. Here's a challenge: Fill them in.

After this cutscene, you're awoken in the house of Doc Mitchell, a uhh, a doctor, who patched you up. Create your character, and get a little exposition. They, open the door. Meet your new home.

The wasteland.

A vast, desolate expanse. Filled with scavengers, filled with thieves, filled with mutant enemies. But, filled with something else. Filled with a people. Filled with families. Filled with humanity, trying their best to survive against all odds. Fighting the giant insects pounding at their door, hunting for blood.

You meet this vast place, from the relative safety of a small town called Goodsprings.

When I first entered the wasteland, I had a similar reaction as with PlanetSide 2: Holy hell that's big. I opened my Pip-Boy, and took a gander at all the empty space, waiting to be populated by cities, towns, the Strip, and so much more waiting to be discovered.

I wasn't thrust immediately into combat. I wasn't thrust immediately into a tough decision. I wasn't thrown immediately into an exposition dump so lengthy I was bored. Instead, I was thrust into the open arms of a small town. With people. And I met those people. And those people had ideas. They had lives. Most other games fail to show this. NPCs are merely their title: shopkeeper, clerk, janitor, whatever. These people were, in that sense, real.

When I was told that they could be in danger, I never felt anything like it. Somehow, in the short amount of time I had been with the people at Goodsprings, I cared for them. They became almost like family. I didn't want to see them hurt.

And that wasn't the only time.

You may know about companions, and there is one that I took on. (Won't say for spoilers) I took them along with me, developed a relationship with them, got to know them, talked to them, used their skills. When the time came, many hours in, I had to make a choice. There were two goals for me. One of which meant turning my companion against me. The things I felt afterwards... I was not prepared. No game had broken through me before. I was strong, but here I stumbled. I only wish more games could repeat this, and come as close as this one.

----------------------------------

I guess I've been talking about feelings for a little while, and I suppose every review needs a gameplay section. Hmm. It's good. Very good. Mostly intuitive, though a few things required a quick google. For the record, I played on Hardcore mode.

Pip-Boy takes a bit of getting used to for me, a first time user, but it was second nature by the end of the game. I'm not exactly a fan of list-based inventories, but it was fine.

VATS was good as a targeting system, but I got so heavily reliant on it that all my shots became simple RNG rather than actual skill shooting. I suppose that's fine, I didn't have a problem with it.

Movement was good. When is it not though, really?

Inventory management was tricky. I started vigorously cleaning my stash, trying to keep it very low so I never got overburdened. By the end of it, well, I had 23 wine bottles just sitting there. How did you think it went?

And of course, Hardcore mode's specialty: ammo weight (a pain, for sure) along with hunger, thirst, and sleep. Honestly, I only slept once. I guess it's just because of all the Nuka-Cola I was drinking instead of Stimpaks (which I had plenty of, by the way). Hunger was only a minor inconvenience, but thirst... I recommend keeping a ton of water on you. Don't want to be caught thirsty.

----------------------------------

Music is great. Loved almost all of the tracks, but the ones at Hoover Dam get a bit repetitive after a while. Maybe it's just me. I discovered the radio function very late into the game, but once I did, oh why did it take me so long. For God's sake, turn on the radio for some of the best songs I've heard in a game.

----------------------------------

I suppose, in this day and age, one must rate the graphics in a videogame. Of course, Fallout: New Vegas does not have the best graphics. Not by a longshot. Keep in mind though, it came out in 2010. So it's not new. I found it bearable. Not the greatest, but never getting in the way of my enjoyment. Gameplay and story before graphics, and I will stand by that.

----------------------------------

A note on the bugginess:
Yeah, it's buggy. A nice friend of mine mentioned a few mods one should use while playing the game. I recommend you use them as well, lest your game crash and leave you with a save multiple hours old. (Which I have done, luckily not a crash but I did forget to save for a solid 4 hours. Christ, this game can really keep you interested. Two o'clock and I finally remembered to eat lunch) Anyway, the mods:

New Vegas Script Extender: http://nvse.silverlock.org/
New Vegas Anti-Crash: https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635
Fallout: New Vegas 4GB Patcher: https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62552

----------------------------------

TL; DR

1) Read it you lazy bastard

2) Fallout: New Vegas is one of the greatest games I have ever played. It is worth a play. Maybe even two, three, or more. It has one of the best atmospheres, and stellar gameplay to boot. However, I would recommend a few mods. See above for the links.
I decided to take down my negative review and try to stabilize the game and write a positive review something that this game deserves!

Pros:
- Replayability Value
- Multiple ways to solve quests
- Ammo Crafting and Ammo Types
- RPG elements 
- Interesting Factions
- Lore
- Roleplay-ability
- Awesome Radio Songs
- Achievements aren't disabled if you use mods
- Fun mini-games that are very rewarding
- Cheap
- No Settlements and Preston Garvey
- Mods for everything! And I mean EVERYTHING! Combat, Power Armor, Faction Armor, Throwing Weapons! You can have everything that Fallout 4 did good in Fallout New Vegas!
- Great DLCs

Cons:
- Locked at 2GB RAM (You can increase it up to 4 with a mod)
(That's the only con I can think of)


As a new player in the Fallout universe and Fallout 4 being my first I can assure you that this game is propably the best in the series (I haven't played the classics so i exclude them)! Hell I even unlocked all achievements! The mod community is one of the best I've seen so far alongside the Skyrim mod community!


10/10 Best Fallout (excluding the classics)!
My first Fallout game was Fallout 4, and I thought that it was a great game. Then I thought to my self that I want to play the other fallout games. So I went and bought Fallout New Vegas. And HOLY SHIT was I amazed. I made it trough the main story, but I still have so much to see. There is so much to do and see in this game. And I have to say Fallout 4 is bullshit compared to this masterpiece. This is a true RPG, everything effects the ending. Even the guns are so much more cool and better than in Fallout 4. If you consider buying this game, DO IT NOW! 

Beware!: The game freezed and crashed for me many times, so you have to get used to it. Get some mods that can help you with it, and learn the load order stuff it will help you alot. Get LOOT for your load order.

Best game ever 10/10

Boy, should Bethesda be jelous of Obsidian Enterteintment.

New Vegas has to be the most clever 3D Fallout game so far. Yeah, sure, Fallout 4 is more polished, with its shiny HD graphics. But, man, is New Vegas just so clever in its writting.

Never has a dead wasteland felt so alive, full of quirky, clever, and lovable characters. Every single place you go, you'll find something new and unexpected that will catch you by surprise saying "Ha, bet you did think of that happening!". You really fall in love with the characters in this game, don't even get me started on the super mutants / nightkin.

Obsidian Enterteintment has earned my respect with this game and I will be definitely be looking forward for future projects.
If I had to choose one game and one game only to play for the rest of my life, Fallout: New Vegas might be it. This game has endless replay value. Four major faction storylines with around 5 other faction sidequest lines, dozens upon dozens of sidequests, dozens of unmarked quests. In my hundreds of hours playing this on Xbox I still haven't completed all of them. Over 188 locations (not including unmarked locations), 316 with the four major DLCs. I still haven't discovered every one in a single playthrough. As far as choices go, this game remains unmatched. Dialouge gives you a dizzying array of choices and options on how to interect with characters, solve problems, complete quests, etc. Weapon choice is equally endless and beats both Fallout 3 and 4 in variation (though admittingly many weapons are useless later in the game). On top of that, most weapons come with various mods you can collect throughout your exploration. There's also dozens of unique weapons to add to your already stocked cabinet of firepower. In terms of overall content, this game is packed to the brim.

Storywise, this game is equally impressive. Without spoiling anything, a simple revenge story turns into a complex 4-way war between the major factions, with you at the center. Factions like Caesar's Legion, New California Republic, Mr. House, Brotherhood of Steel, Boomers, Great Khans, Powder Gangers, White Glove Society and more await for you to meet them and decide their fates and quell their internal stuggles. Each also come with their own unique and interesting backstories.

My only real gripe with this game are the bugs. This game is notorious for the amount of gamebreaking bugs it had on release. The first set of patchnotes even excluded a description of all the quest script bugs it fixed (well over 300). However, several patches later, many of the bugs are gone. Given how big this game is, there are still many remaining, BUT with access to unoffical patches and console commands on PC, they aren't really a big problem, if at all. Oh and by the way, this game still boasts a big community of people still playing and making mods for this game. Not just graphics or weapon mods either. Some of the bigger ones are comparable to full blown DLC (Ghoulville is my favorite).

I've played many RPGs throughout the years. Fallout 4 may be bigger, Skyrim more ambitious, The Witcher 3 more cinematic, KOTOR more innovative, but I can say without a shadow of a doubt, Fallout: New Vegas is the one you will get the most out of in terms of content, storytelling and replayability. If you're gonna get a Fallout game, get this one. 10/10.
The best game of all fallout series:)
+Good story with even Dlc's
+Many many weapons and a lot of customizations
+Many intresting characters
+Good old Mojave desert:)
+Awesome Gameplay
+Its easy to die:)
+Hadrcore Mode

-You can't play after end:(
Them quack doctors can say what they want about all the radscorpion stings that done pierced my skull. I know what I seen.   	If anyone asks, we never spoke. It's ghouls, I tell ya. Religious ghouls in rockets looking for a land to call their own. Don't you laugh at me. I know a spell that'll make you show your true form. Cave rat taught it to me. You come any closer and I'm liable to stick you with my stickin' knife. Ol' Sticky's feeling mighty ornery this day. Molerat men, come up from the Underneath to steal young women with promises of riches and fancy mud mansions with all the latest designer appliances. They covet our ladyfolk's long hair for wigs, it's said, being either bald or balding themselves. I don't trust a man that doesn't have something strange going on about him, 'cause it means he's hiding it from you. If a man's wearing his pants on his head or if he says his words backwards from time to time, you know it's all laid out there for you. But if he's friendly to strangers and keeps his home spick-and-span, more often than not he's done something even his own ma couldn't forgive. I seen one of them disappear and reappear before my very eyes. Ghosts. Commie ghosts what don't know they're dead.  Hoping to steal our rockets so they can fly up and paint the moon pink and draw a Lenin face on it.  	I seen one of them disappear and reappear before my very eyes. Although being a scientist, I have to admit I might've just blinked for longer than usual, what with the shock of seeing a commie ghost and so forth. I thought it was cannibals, come to eat us all for sure, so I kept out of sight. But now I know better. I come face to face with the chupacabra himself one night whilst I was investigating whether this gecko was hiding his treasure from me. He was the meanest, ugliest chupacabra you could imagine. Had two heads, and fangs down to the ground. Best I could tell, anyways, since when he come up to me he was invisible. Had himself a blunderbuss what would rotate and shoot bullets real fast out of a backpack. Never seen nothing like it. We got a chupacabra with an automatic weapon. And that's when they get real quiet, 'cause now they see the predicament we're in. Trying to hide from extra terrestrials what can only see in black and white checkers. But they're not fooled 'cause he forgot to put the checkers on his face. I told him so and he seemed to take it to heart. I know what I seen.
Fallout New Vegas is a game that comes around only once in a decade. Maybe two decades. It's just one of those games where you either love it and think that it's the best game that has ever been made to represent the fallout universe, or you hate it because you are a sad person who hates fun (or just doesn't enjoy these kinds of games which I can understand. To each their own.) I've put in over 300+ hours on steam officially and probably another 200+ hours offline. The modding community for this game is....well its like nothing I have ever seen before. There is a mod for almost everything. I took great pleasure in modding this game to the point where it nearly crashed many times and yet I still played on. If you like a game where the choices you make actually matter, where the people you meet are interesting and have a story to tell, and if you just love getting to take pot shots at drugged up junkies with explosive anti-tank rounds, this game is for you. 
∞/10. Would come back as the Courier to kill Benny again. 

5 years ago I made the decision of buying a copy of "Fallout New Vegas" on a sale, worth as much as a bottle of water.
A year later I purchased the upgrade to the game of the year edition at another sale for the price of a slice of pizza.

All these years later, with several annual re-plays of the main campaign and its DLC content, I am baffled about how its base price manages to be this low given the high quality of content in terms of writing and world building.

Despite the initial launch problems of the game due to glitches and stability issues (which were just as present in its predecessor title by Bethesda, Fallout 3) and the fact that the development took place within just 18 months, Obsidian Entertainment managed to squeeze as much content, lore and interesting quests into the best 3D Fallout game so far.

Every intersection in the road throws a new challenge at you, be it a rivaling faction, which marked you for death, the unforgiving wild life trying to get a bite out of you or strangers you encounter, sharing a story of their own while warming up at the campfire - all taking place in the vast and beautiful mojave desert.

So while Bethesda has laid the technical foundation for the newer Fallout games, Obsidian breathed the life into them, going all the way back to the days of Interplay which kicked off the Fallout franchise as a whole.

It's unfortunate Obsidian won't find themselves creating a successor to New Vegas anytime soon - it would be absolutely amazing if they would - but until that were to happen... there will always be time for another re-play of New Vegas.
The magical adventures of the mailman who's chemed out of his mind, the sniper who can change the camera when you least expect it thus causing a jump scare, the lesbian with a penchant for fisting things into oblivion, the alcoholic redhead, the good spherical boy, the good boy with a fear of hats, your dillusional grandmother, Danny Trejo, and a docter.

You can go on such magical adventures such as: have a conversation with your own brain, trip balls and fight a flaming bear,  fight an unbelievable amount of roman cosplayers alongside people dressed as cowboys. Get fisted by a robot designed for maximum pleasure. 

The choices are endless.

WARNING: May repeatedly crash when using an ample number of mods
This game might have so many flaws like bugs and crushes, but in my experience this game is one of the best Open World RPG. The story, every NPC you can talk to, the environment, the decisions that you make if you're gonna do something whether its bad or good people will recognize depending on your actions. Theres so much in this game that you can experince. It feels so alive. 


Really recommended to all gamers. 10/10
Fallout New Vegas has everything that modern fallout titles are missing. Story, Depth, Replay Value, and Structure. Fallout New Vegas does not randomize enemy encounters and loot. if you intend to build a character a certain way, the necessary equipment will always be behind the same locked door or security terminal, some people overlook the importance of this as Fallout New Vegas encourages you to approach the post apocalyptic wasteland in different ways. Fallout 4 relies on random loot drops to change the experience of each playthrough. FNV has very few short comings but it would be unfair to avoid disclosing them. Obsidian entertainment was forced to rush out FNV with a minimal period of development and production which resulted in certain faction quest lines being incredibly underwhelming and transparently partial. The "evil" Legion has lots of promise as you can instead choose to ignore the fundamental New California Republic and help establish a tyrannical dictatorship of the mojave desert, that is until you learn that pursuing the legion questline ends the game significantly sooner than almost any other route with less content being explored. Outside of the shortcomings in content for certain paths in the game, Fallout New Vegas manages to make a finite world seemingly infinite. I have replayed through the same quests and locations of the game countless times and still today I am finding new bits of lore and connections that make the game radiate with charm and narrative. Fallout New Vegas is without a doubt the best first person fallout rpg in that it is strikingly like a classic fallout rpg. Sometimes you forget you are playing a first person shooter because the focal aspect of roleplaying, and that is the greatest achievement of this game. I could not recommend a single other game if you are looking for an roleplaying experience with depth.
An eighth grader, I pulled this one out of the (physical) bargain bin at Fred Meyer's and asked my dad if my allowance would cover it. He tried to hand me cash, but I blushed and pointed at the M for Mature on the cover. He probably rolled his eyes, but I was a pretty Good Kid and an even better smooth talker when there were video games at stake.

I am so incredibly thankful that the gunplay in this game fucking sucked. I'm thankful that I struggled to properly navigate or appreciate the wasteland during my first few days in it, only to then slowly unwrap one of the only games that met and exceeded all of the unreasonable and impossible expectations a young adult lets into their head when they look at a game's cover art. I enjoy recalling the simple melodrama my old self thought they were tearing through as they sided with the NCR and f***** up every form of opposition that fell upon them. I enjoy coming back to the game now to laugh at my old self as well as to remind myself why it will always be important to get into fights at parties about how Fallout 4 in absolutely no way is part of the "good old days" of this "franchise."

Can you even call it a franchise when Todd Howard gets to make games with titles that share a word with "Fallout: New Vegas?"

Anyhow, I used to think that this game forever changed the way I would look at games because it was my entry into a deep, dark, and delectable world of Mature gaming. I'm beginning to think it's changed the way I look at games because it's the only great one I've ever played.

Masterpiece.
[h1]Fallout: New Vegas ★★★★☆ (4.8) [/h1]

I played this game for the first time in 2019, and I did so because some people commented my Fallout 4 review saying that New Vegas and Fallout 3 were better. I’m glad I believed them.
This is a true masterpiece, one of the few cases in which the majority of the people is right, this game is far superior to Fallout 4 in some aspects, though it’s still inferior in some others.
If I had to choose between this and Fallout 4, I wouldn’t know, since both are excellent games and each has as many advantages as disadvantages.
If Fallout 4 for example, they decided to simplify (or even remove) some systems like the decisions, the dialogue options, the multiple endings, etc. But it still added some very important features such as the new crafting/upgrading system for weapons, armor and power armors; the settlement building, the survival mode, and some things like the resource management, the exploration and the shooting mechanics have been massively improved.

However, about New Vegas...

[b]The good: [/b]

✔ Decisions that truly matter and affect the world (unlike Fallout 4)
✔ Dialogue options, incredibly superior to Fallout 4’s.
✔ Extremely fun campaign and superior to Fallout 4’s (though it’s a bit shorter)
✔ Interesting characters and factions, each with great variety of missions and stories.
✔ Huge amount of secondary missions and places to explore.
✔ I found almost no bugs or performance issues.
✔ S.P.E.C.I.A.L.” system, levels, experience and skills are better than Fallout 4’s.
✔ Excellent DLCs (Lonesome Road and Dead Money)
✔ Epic endings that explain what happen to each faction or character after the story ends (unlike Fallout 4, in which no matter what ending you choose, the ending cinematic is the same)

[b]The bad: [/b]

✖ The gameplay is undoubtedly inferior to Fallout 4 (the weapons, for example, behave and fire way worse compared to Fallout 4 or any modern shooter)
✖ The map is worse and more boring than Fallout 4’s map.
✖ You can’t run/sprint. Though there’s a mod for it.
✖ The weapon/armor repair system is terrible, I’m glad they removed it for Fallout 4.
✖ Same as Fallout 4, some things need a better explanation or tutorial since they’re not clear for people who didn’t play any Fallout game before.
✖ One disastrous DLC (Old World Blues)
✖ The Mojave conflict ([spoiler] Hoover dam[/spoiler]) is way worse than Fallout 4’s Commonwealth conflict ([spoiler] The Institute and their Synths[/spoiler]), I just found it less interesting.

[b]Notes: [/b]

• After I played this great game, I edited my Fallout 4 review, though I still recommend it.

[b] Fallout: New Vegas is, for me, the best game of the year 2010, and obviously recommend it at any price, with some DLCs.[/b]

All I can say if it doesn't have 76 in the title, then this game is good.













All seriousness though this game is probably one of my favorite games I've ever played.  Funny enough this being my first fallout game I've ever played, and being the best one imo.
I've played this game 4 times in just under 70 hours of playtime, reaching cap each time.



If you're looking for a Fallout game to get into Fallout with, New Vegas is the best personally.
Pros:

1. Story
2. Atmosphere
3. Choice of Weapons and Playstyle (with Dlcs)
4. Lot of Factions and Npcs to interact with
5. Big world to explore with around 100 hours of playtime (with Dlcs)
6. A lot of references to older titles
7. Good range of companions
8. Easy fast travel option
9. Music and soundeffects
10. Most of the Dlcs (except Honest Hearts)
11. Great modding community

Neutral: 

1. Graphics are outdated (you really want to use some mods for that)
2. Some bugs (there also mods for them)

Cons:

1. Gameworld lacks some Depth at times

In-Depth Review:

There is nothing fancy about the story. No big plot twists, or anything you have never seen befor. It's the possibilities and different angles you can tackle the story from, which makes the game great.
The Atmosphere is just stunning, either if you walk around all alone, or with a companion. The ambient music just add to it wherever you are. There also a few radio stadions you can tune into, with the "Old World Blues" Dlc adds the very best of them. 

Crawling around in caves, exploring buildings, introduce yourself to a new faction, or just hang out in the Wasteland. 
The ingame world is more then big enough to explore for a few hours of your life. The second you explore a new location, you can fast travel there. Which you have to do a lot sometimes, when you are questing . 
Which brings me to the only real con of the game. There so many places which feel a little off and i never really found a real purpose for. And the main habitats could be more connected, or rather be connected at all. 

Nonetheless, when it comes to roleplay, that's the Fallout game you wanna play. The sheer number of choices, when it comes to your personal playstyle, it's just insane. There pistols, rifles, shotguns, heavy weapons, even more heavier weapons, energy weapons, unarmed and all kind of melee weapons. You can stealth, smartass, or bribe your way through the game, but you still have to fight at times. Unfortunately there is no way around that. 

Graphics are very outdated, especially the textures and the faces of the npcs. But there comes help with a great modding community. It took me a few hours to get me a perfect setting of new textures (items, weapons, faces, flora and fauna), added gameplay elements (Project Nevada, more Traits and Perks and such) and even an ENB (if your computer can handle all that stuff). But it's absolutely worth it.

Last point is the Dlcs and that's where the game really shines. Every Dlc brings a standalone area, where you can travel to , when you have discovered the entrance. 
"Old World Blues" tops them all, for me a least. It brings humor, a good story, insane side characters, references to the old games and that awesome radio stadion music. Very well done.
"Dead Money" have great depth, a very unique situation to handle, interesting companions and story to offer.
"Lonesome Road" brings and interesting aspect from the couriers past into play and you will find yourself in an unique situation as well, but it just dont have the depth of the previous two.
While "Honest Hearts" nearly fails in everything above. No depth, uninteresting story and unispired companions and side characters. That i didnt liked it, dosent mean you dont like it ofc. Just try it out for yourself, but be warned ^^

Long story short. If you like roleplaying in an dystopian setting, wanna see what a well written Fallout game looks like, or just wanna destroy a "mighty" Deathclaw with an Atomic Missle (Fat Man) that's the game for you. Worth every penny.
Whoops, better put on my newsman fedora, here.

The buggiest and best Fallout game 

+ fantastic dialogue
+ deep lore
+ great artstyle
+ memorable Characters
+ brilliant sound design

6969420/10
On the plus side, this game is quite entertaining.  First, gameplay is still challenging at high levels.  Second, the writing quality is good; the Fallout contrast of daffy 50's tropes with the wrecked postwar world remains sharp, and provides many of the funnier one-liners I've encountered while gaming.  Third, character specialization is a real thing; if you have the dlc's you will likely max out all your skills, but perk selection and characteristics (strength etc, aka "S.P.E.C.I.A.L) will have long term consequences on combat style and will allow or foreclose on some play options.

On the minus side even by Bethesda standards this game is an unstable bugfest.  Running Windows 10 on a strong PC it took six mods to get ordinary gameplay operating correctly (or at all).  Also, the vanilla UI is cluttered and requires endless scrolling to find specific items.  Too, the vanilla graphics are low res and rather bland; this would not ordinarily matter much to me but you often need to find small objects and it is frequently quite hard to see either because of light levels or because of clutter. 

As a final note (as it does not reflect on the game's own merits) this game is somewhat difficult to mod due to frequent incompatibilities between mods, requiring more than usual care about both installation and load orders and many compatibility patches.


Sal doesn't have any photo editing software to make memes so he has to use a review for the best fallout game instead, making him tonight's big loser.
A diamond made in rough.
Fallout 3 was a very fun game, but New Vegas took it's base and made what a Fallout game ought to be and feel like. 
It has the first person action, with proper RPG depth in mechanics. 
The story is no push-over either, letting you influence alot on around the world, and no empty map either, you'll very frequently run into something, or someone, you can interact with.
It's easily my second favourite Fallout.
Of all the modern Fallout games this is without doubt my favorite, everything from the characters to the music, the bizarre mix of 50's americana and mad max, the humor and the power the player has to effect the story. It really drew me into the world when I first played it. Even now I sometimes get the urge to reinstall and run another character in spite of 200+ hours played. If you somehow haven't played it yet and you enjoy deep roleplaying, great atmosphere, or just want to cause havoc in a (fairly) reactive world, then you should definitely consider picking it up.
This game is a landmark in gaming. Take note you MMORPG moneygrabbing ***** currently working at Bathesda. This is how you make a video game... wtf happened to the gaming industry? we want falout 4 graphics with falout 1 script why is it so hard for you to understand? Dont need no fancy community, no fancy crafting system and definately no microtransacions ffs... how starved are you?!?! you are making games you're supposed to want to make people happy not maximising your profits. I am never buying an mmorpg again ever those things are glorified grind fests and i've had enough for one lifetime. Unless the AR tech comes out, in which case you better forget i exist coz imma be in that thing 24/7. Damn imagine being able to play new vegas with AR tech... i just got shivers.
New Vegas is the kind of game that just feels like home. I can go through my entire Steam library but I'll still come back to NV from time to time. The Mojave desert is vast and diverse, most of the main characters are well written and every single story path is insanely good. And having Ron Pearlman to narrate some of the cutscenes is just the cherry on top.

Like any other Bethesda game, New Vegas has a lot of bugs and exploits, but nothing too crazy that would take away from the overall experience. The game could use some polishing, maybe a remake in the near future, but a fantastic game and a must-have in any Steam library.

9.5/10.


It is New Vegas, what more is to be said? It is good in story and combat. Base game survival is more annoying than difficult as food / water needs are extremely slow to catch up on you (you could run across the map 1.5 times before needing to eat / drink something). DLC except for Old World Blues are good (I find O.W.B just is a grind + recovery mission that lasts 5 hours). Factions / endings are pretty even except for the Legion as they didn't get as much development but they still have some stuff to do. Weapons and crafting are very good in my opinion, find stuff and scrap stuff to make new / better / unique stuff, a fair system for an rpg.

Cons:
- glitches with some quests (many fixable but annoying if you aren't ready for them)
- terrain / textures bug out in the distance sometimes
- doesn't last long enough
- Radio soundtracks get repetitive after some time
- If you reach level 40, even on hard mode the game is pretty easy so many enemies (except deathclaws and some main-factions nps's / soldiers) are just quick kills
Even though this game is old it brings back great memories. If you're a fan of modern fallout games this game is so much better in content and it really shows just how bad/lazy modern fallout games have become.
This is really good I recommend it. It's amazing and better than fallout 4 story-wise and the mods can add even more story!
The personality's, the crippling system, the enemy's, the factions and the side quests are the staples of this game and it works!
LOVE THIS GAME TO DEATH. I can't stress how good the story and game play of this is, as normally I make memey reviews but this is the one review I'll but serious, PLAY THIS FUCKING GAME. 


Spoilers!
[spoiler] I really hated Benny and was favoring the NCR for a good portion of the game for me, but actually digging in and learning in this game is rewarding and I was constantly changing how I looked at a bleak, desolate wasteland for a very, very long time. This game has done something that even Black Mesa couldn't do (And Black Mesa was a Great old time.), Make me not just think, but rethink. In most games, killing NPCs and doing whatever you wanted was allowed or even rewarded, but in this one you really have to think about the characters and you treat each character like a real person instead of a bot inside a Videogame. Obsidian you smart assholes, you created something unforgetable. [/spoiler]
Amazing game.

The Ending choice of whose faction you'd support will always make you think about whats best for the mojave, or if it fits your Roleplaying.

That is if you even make it to the end since there are hours of things to do in-game.

Gameplay - Aged fine like wine.

Highly recommended.
FONV is absolutely stunning being the first RPG i ever played, first on xbox and then on steam. I've never enjoyed gameplay so much with this kind of story and decision-based outcomes. I recommend this game to anyone starting out in FPS/RPG games.

Truly a great RPG- I think it goes a bit too far to call it the literal best, but its pretty far up there, and arguably the best 3D RPG (albeit I'm not too familiar with 3D RPG's, so take that with a grain of salt.) You truly get to ROLEPLAY, with a variety of choices and many different endings you can achieve. You really give your character a role, with not too much of it being staticly set to you (the Lonesome Road dlc adds quite a bit more for the courier, which would be worth mentioning, however.) I find myself playing this very frequently, and it made me enough of a fan to buy Fallout 3 (which I bought in GOG for compatibility reasons) and the 3 originals. It can be at times very slow paced, and there are definitely some poor elements to to the game that would be prudent to mention. I can state some pro's and con's off the top of my head, so I will do so:

Pros-
-True roleplaying capability that I touched on a bit in my opening statement. I think a large part of my gameplay has been for roleplaying's sake, as I've already seen almost every single ending (through gameplay or otherwise) and most quests. The thing is, though, you get immersed into your character and it makes each string of quests and choice seem very interconnected and important, even if some of the time it is an illusion. This not only makes the game very replayable, but it also makes it feel like a journey each time.
-There's a pretty cool combat system. Although the combat overall is quite bad, I would argue, the actual system including DT and VATS is pretty cool and fun to use, even if you want to argue its just a gimmick, it's a long lasting one (although after 465 hours I still find it fun, so I don't think "gimmick" really gives it justice).
-There's a console you can dick around in. For me, being able to dick around and test the game is very important, and that's something you can do. If this is something you also find fun, you'll find the console to be a joy; you can do a lot more than you can in most games, and its pretty easy with the thorough (fan made) wiki's this game has online. The console overall is hardly problematic.
-Can actually teach you a lot. Talking to one particular legionary, I've actually been opened up to a lot of philosophical thoughts I'd never thought of. What's more, I've learned a lot of history, stemming from this game and leading out to really cool world events I'd not known about prior.
-Depending on the type of person you are, may open you up to some moral quandaries. At times these quandaries are pretty dry, and depending on how you play videogames, may not really open to you as much as the prospect of blowing shit up will. However, various groups and quests leave you wondering whether or not you're thought process is okay, or who and what is most needed.
-Very moddable. Although you may not feel the need to, the option to dabble into the mods that players have made is quite nice, and I've enjoyed a large portion of it.

Cons-
-The game is very glitchy and not very compatible with modern systems. Buying the GOG version of this game instead of this one helps to fix this, but if you buy it on steam, mods are a necessity to fix it. And I do mean a necessity; the game will crash too frequently and your experience will be ruined. So be prepared to get mods, or switch to GOG for this one.
-Shooter combat is inconsistent and pretty poorly made. I don't really know how to adapt too much on this, but when you play it, you can really tell. It feels not smooth and a lot of damage values and options don't really make sense. And combat is glitched at times, especially with explosives.
-Outdated. You are looking at an old game. Unless you get some mods, the game will play and feel like its release date, which may be hard for you to acclimate to.
-Slow. This may be a deal breaker for you. For some, like me, its not that big of a deal, but I've had friends who have bought and refunded the game simply because they felt really slow. This mostly means the actual way you move, but at times story progression and pace can be too slow for ones liking. 

So, take from that what you will. Unless the cons seem to blaring for you to enjoy the game, I would highly recommend buying it. I've played it a lot, and I'm not even close to done. This will in time (if it isn't already) be remembered as a gem of a classic that is played for a very long time.
Hell hath no fury like an angry mailman... In new vegas you play as a young lad just doing his job trying to get by in the capitalist new world that is the mojave wasteland. Until one day a man wearing a checkerboard, that your dad probably made in his highschool wood shop, on his suit shoots you in the head because he has a crippling gambling addiction and he only needs one more chip inorder to win back his fortune and make his wife love him again. But jokes on him because you have a MASSIVE brain you were able to deflect the bullet using  your mind powers. You then make it your lifes goal to find the checker man along with a balding man with tuberculosis who wears a shower curtain combined with a bears hide because hes cosplaying as his favorite Roman dictator to cope with his insecurities. While in the mean time you help others and defeat literally entire armies for fun becoming a very god to these beta humans.
The gem of the Fallout series.

The game has an enthusing story for many hours worth of play time and many unique playthroughs everytime you launch the game. With many DLC to extend the story of the game it's easily one of the longer fallouts. With many guns and weapons to collect makes every fight become fun and unique. If you looking for an easy way to pass time and just enjoy your day in general this game is definitely one of the best.

I recommend this game to everyone.
A solid 9/10 probably one of the best games I've ever played it's in my like top 3 games don't even wait for a sale just buy it now and if your scrolling through reviews to see if it's good go right up and buy it NOW like this second

I'd like to call this as... um...

You know what, even without mods, some places can crash the game completely.

Mods do enrich this game out and add a lot of possibilities, like new quest, weapons, you name it.

Story is... it depends on which faction you like to join, and each one will have different endings. Beside that, there's also... I can't say, but people said that who you encounter could be a part of the story and being told at the game ending as well. Politically driven, I'd say.

As for DLC stories, you can reveal every side stories related to New Vegas, and also a good one for grinding your character to a maximum level (before Fallout 4, this has been capped to level 50, that's the con of this game because it's a skill-based system as in 3), although personally I still haven't tried it (gotta work up to recommended levels first).

I'd recommend this if you have a non-high or high end PC where you can't play Fallout 4. Or take FO3 as an alternate.
I know this sounds crazy but can I like Fallout: New Vegas and Fallout 4? I know, I know I shouldn't have even thought about that. All jokes aside, I LOVE this game I don't even know what to say that has already been said. My first playthrough I had no care for the story or characters I just typed cheats in the console and killed every NPC I saw until I was bored then I abandoned my old Steam account and created a new one. as years pass by and I start watching gaming videos I watched some New Vegas videos made my Oxhorn it encouraged me to buy it on the Lunar New Year sale this time I didn't kill everyone I saw I watched and listened to the characters interact. I haven't beaten yet. But I'm sure I will. I'm having as much fun as I did on Fallout 4. 9/10 would recommend.
To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
Its like Skyrim, but with guns and in Post Nuclear War. Highly replayable, many different types of playstyles, great stories, tons (And i mean tons) of choices. See this group of raiders? You can either kill them or negotiate for hostages. Want to help criminals take over Goodsprings? You can! A must play for anyone who likes these kind of games.
The intentionally hard to look at artstyle of this game jives well with the oppressive atmosphere. I have never been so impressed by how much a game could make me hate what I was seeing in front of me yet respect it because I knew it was intentional. Even the high class casinos are floored with worn carpets and have walls with peeling paint. Everything is underwhelming and your life is disappointing but there's nothing else you can do. Everything is rusty and it makes you want to jump off the Hoover Dam. Additionally, your comfy conceptions of morality will be tested against the rapid change that the face of the Mojave desert and its people have endured .

The classic Bethesda buggyness is there, it is an old game, but the RPG elements are the best of any First-Person Bethesda game and the story is unparalleled. 

8.5/10 would get addicted to Mentats to pass a science check to help a robo-dictator rule Las Vegas again
Amazing! This has to be the best Fallout game ever made. The story is intersting and engaging, the weapons and gunplay feel nice and fluid and the locations are always intersing. In my opinion the best thing to do though is to get the ultimate edition with all the DLCs and addons as you are going to be missing out on quite a lot playing the vanilla game. 
Not a lot of bad here to say, it does crash from time to time and freeze as well but its not all that frequent. There are bugs here and there but they're no bigge or game breaker.
Overall 9/10
To the town of Agua Fria rode a stranger one fine day
Hardly spoke to folks around him, didn't have too much to say,
No one dared to ask his business, no one dared to make a slip
The stranger there among them had a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
It was early in the morning when he rode into the town
He came riding from the south side, slowly lookin' all around
"He's an outlaw loose and runnin'", came a whisper from each lip
"And he's here to do some business with a big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip"
In this town there lived an outlaw by the name of Texas Red
Many men had tried to take him and that many men were dead
He was vicious and a killer, though a youth of twenty four
And the notches on his pistol numbered one and nineteen more,
One and nineteen more
Now the stranger started talkin' made it plain to folks around
Was an Arizonia ranger, wouldn't be too long in town
He was here to take an outlaw back alive or maybe dead
And he said it didn't matter that he was after Texas Red,
After Texas Red
Wasn't long before this story was relayed to Texas Red
But the outlaw didn't worry, men who tried before were dead
Twenty men had tried to take him, twenty men had made a slip,
Twenty one would be the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
Now the morning passed so quickly and it was time for them to meet
It was twenty past eleven when they rode out in the street
Folks were watchin' from their windows,
Every body held their breath,
They knew this handsome ranger was about to meet his death,
About to meet his death
There was twenty feet between them
When they stopped to make their play
And the swiftness of the Ranger still talked about today
Texas Red had not cleared leather when a bullet fairly ripped
And the ranger's aim was deadly, with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
It was over in a moment and the crowd all gathered 'round
There before them lay the body of the outlaw on the ground
Oh, he might have went on livin' but he made one fatal slip
When he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
Big iron, big iron,
Oh he tried to match the ranger with the big iron on his hip,
Big iron on his hip
10/10 would big iron again
Best Fallout game known to the series, i would recommend this game if your looking for an open world RPG, with replay ability. Get lost in a world for weeks, for the price id say get this game!
>president kimball giving his speech

look out president kimball, he's got a sniper rifle!

oh wait, oh god, oh no, he can't hear us, because he's got airpods in!111!!
This game is truly unpredictable your 
delivering a package and you get shot by some random guy in a white suit, then your being a badass by killing hundreds of enemies and meeting the NCR that always say that exact damn line "Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a Nuclear Winter" but in the end you'll end up getting cocked by a deathclaw and cazadores 100/10 game.
Probably the best Fallout, and probably the best Action-RPG. One of those Bethesda masterpieces that, on the other hand, is full of glitches and all of those things Bethesda doesn't care. Obsidian made this with a team of less than 90 people, taking everything from FO3, literally, and made it better. Unfortunately, this also means that most of the problems related to game engine are still present. Still, not a reason not to buy this 10/10.
Easily my favorite fallout. The side missions are all a blast to play. The story really indulges you and you can literally replay the game from the beginning and have a completely different outcome based on what faction you decide to go with.
This game is the best Fallout game. It is a little outdated, but it is more playable and enjoyable than Fallout 76 or 4. Recommended to Fallout fans and people who like games.
Q: Are there frogs in Fallout: New Vegas?
A: I am sorry to report that despite the unmatched character freedom and roleplaying opportunities Fallout: New Vegas offers, with its varied characters full of depth and its wide array of colorful factions to align with or oppose, contained within a beautifully realized open world of somber majesty and capped off with a stiff but enjoyable combat system, I cannot recommend Fallout: New Vegas. Due to its setting in the Mojave Desert of post-apocalyptic Nevada, the climate is far too dry for any frogs to thrive. There are no frogs in Fallout: New Vegas.

Note: There is an extensive amount of modding support for Fallout: New Vegas. It may be possible to add frogs to the game, in which case it receives my hearty recommendation.
I've tried giving Fallout: New Vegas several chances but as much as I want to like this game I just can't recommend it. I bought the Steam version after my PlayStation 3 version was constantly crashing but at least with that one I could play the game somewhat. Originally I could get as far as "Start New Game" before it crashed but now it's stuck in an apparently infamous launcher loop. I've reinstalled it multiple times, ran it in admin mode, downloaded mods, etc. but it's still not able to start. I've tried looking up more solutions but it seems like most people aren't having issues so I guess for those that do we're just screwed. If it weren't for this glaring issue this game would be amazing but as is I would recommend Fallout 4 over this.
The rpg elements are great and I really love the different factions. But the combat just ruined it for me. Maybe I'm not far enough into the game for weapons with good accuracy, but consistently missing enemies point blank with a so called sniper rifle just kills the fun for me.
Get this game if you want a nostalgic piece of video game history. Otherwise, stay away. This game has, sadly, not aged well. The big open world combined with the inability to sprint makes for some really boring segments, and the hit detection is bad as well. At least it have different skills to level up and use for some segments, and some fun dialogue options here and there.
Great game, albeit with severe problems. The open world of New Vegas that is in the Mojave desert is wonderful. The overall story of New Vegas is engaging (revenge) and many of the side quests are unique. However, as of 2019 I cannot recommend this game. There are better survival and fps / actions games to choose from to spend ones time with.  

-New Vegas is incredibly buggy. These bugs should have been fixed years ago. 
-Having followed the recommended installation to a T,  I cannot get any of the mods to work. They all crash the game at launch.
-Clunky combat, worse than Fallout 3.
-I like survival, just not in this game. Required sleeping and eating is cumbersome and a distraction away from the core game play.
-Many of the in game enemies are bullet sponges thus forcing the player to go out and farm just to get higher level to complete the game.
-The inventory management is a mess and thus frustrating.
-I cannot exit the game without crashing. Probably because this game was designed around Windows Live with Vista / 7?
Terribly boring, desolate wasteland with little to explore, dull story, rancid combat, awful quests, slow gameplay, I don't understand why people like this game... Extremely overrated trash, not very fun at all
I'll be generous and give it a rating of 2/10
