Heroes & Generals is a flawed, yet quite enjoyable WW2 "large scale" FPS/RTS experience. This review is focused on the FPS bit of the game.

Choose between 3 different factions, German (most populated), US (most annoying) and Russian (most... I don't know) and stick your nose into different sized, objective driven maps in large open fields, small towns and forests. Depending on the game mode, you're either defending or attacking objectives, special areas which determine if you lose or win the fight.

There are 5 different careers for you to choose from (Infantry, tank driver, plane pilot, paratrooper and recon,) though a fresh account starts with the basic infantry man. One on each faction. As you play the game, you earn money with which you can buy new guns, vehicles, weapon modifications or brand new soldier careers at your leisure.

Infantry is your basic soldier shoot-man. The backbone of the army and the one that gets blown to pieces the most. They're the most versatile career and have plenty of different weapons and vehicles to unlock throughout the game. They're also the most essential people on the field and a fight without enough infantry is quickly lost.

Tank driver has access to tanks and can spawn in the map as such. They have limited weapons, but the ability to get different tanks more than enough makes up for this.

Pilots have the least weapons to choose from, but they get to fly planes themselves and shoot down the enemy planes and bomb ground targets to bits.

Paratroopers are like infantry, but with slightly more limited weapon options and instead of running or driving to the objectives, they  deploy from a special transport aircraft, parachuting down from above.

Recon is your dedicated sniper career. The only soldier that has access to the powerful 8x magnification scopes for his rifle and some special mods not available for any other soldier.

The gameplay loops is pretty decent. You either have one or more attack lines (A, B, C, D and E) on which you'll spawn in as the soldier career you play as, attacking the defending enemy lines and objectives (O1, O2 and O3). Or you might do the defence instead. On some maps there are only objectives and no attack lines at all. In those maps the faction who holds the majority of the objectives for the longest will win the fight. 

Each match has a set amount of resources for all participating factions. This determines how many times your team can spawn in as their chosen soldier career and how many tanks, planes or vehicles they can spawn with. Run out of soldiers and you can't respawn when you die, thus you lose the fight. Though, nowadays this is quite rare.

The gameplay feels a bit arcadey. Soldiers move much faster than they should be able to, can jump like they were on the moon and the power of ADAD is extremely strong in this game. It wasn't like this back in 2014 when I first started. The game felt much more slower paced and realistic. The introduction of rifle scopes for regular infantry also hurt the game more than the devs care to admit.

One thing this game gets absolutely right though, are uniform camos. They really work and sometimes you'll be hard pressed to spot a soldier lying on the ground or crouching in the shadows or in bushes, just because they blend in so well.

All guns, tanks and vehicles handle differently and they all have unique sounds. You'll learn to recognize which weapon is being fired and which of the several different vehicles is moving nearby. The overall sound quality is nothing to get excited about, but it does its job.

As you play, every action you do gains points towards different ribbons. As you level up these ribbons, you unlock new guns, gun modifications, vehicles and badges. Badges modify your soldier abilities. They let you have a more steady hand while firing, start with more ammo, deal more damage with explosives, sprint longer, steal cars faster, etc. whereas the gun modifications make your gun deal more damage, have a longer range of fire, be more accurate or fire faster.

You also earn money as you play. Your soldier has an hourly base salary which is based on your soldier's rank. The longer the match lasts, the more money you get. In addition to the base salary, you also earn extra for doing things, such as killing the opposition, capturing points, patching wounds, repairing vehicles, exploding things etc.

All your equipment wears out as you use them, so some of that salary income is going towards keeping your guns and items in good condition. Once they wear out completely, you can't use them and you'll have to fix them at some point.

You also earn gold for the first fight of the day. Gold is the "premium" currency and can be bought with real money. Everything you can get with gold you can get with the default currency as well. The grind to unlock weapons, careers and gear through the default currency is not nearly as big of a deal as people sometimes try to make you believe.

There are no squad communication though outside the text chat between your own squad and the rest of the friendly team. So don't expect strategy being a huge part of any fight, unless you play with friends. Most of the time it's a RUSH B! type of deal, hoping you wont get gunned down immediately.

There are no suppression mechanics in the game either. Wounds don't make your soldier perform any worse and generally there's no fear of death. It's not uncommon to shoot somebody in the back, score a hit (or several) and then see them turning around just to one shot kill you.

Overall the game feels a bit too fast paced. Everybody's rushing in like crazy with automatic weapons, spamming grenades and pooping mines like they were candy, not caring if they die in the process or not. There's potential here for H&G to be a much, much better game. But I'm not keeping my hopes very high.

Even still, I'd say give the game a try. It's quite fun in moderation. And don't get discouraged for being 1 shot killed by the enemy snipers,  or when you get mowed down by tanks or get killed by much more powerful, modded guns you still don't have access to. You'll learn how to fight against them, where people camp and how the maps flow.

It's a flawed yet fun game.
----How the game actually plays----

1.-Infantry-
Infantry are the bread and butter of this game and where you will make most of your $.
You start with a 3 shot kill semi auto rifle (can be modded to be a 2 shot kill)
The game is straight foward. If your attacking you must take the objective points and the points to get to the objective points. often abbreviated (o1,o2,o3)
Guns take along time to unlock.
In order to be a 1 hit kill sniper, you need to mod your sniper. Mods cost $ and will drain your $ with every shot. a fully modded 1 shot sniper will not make much money.
infact fully modded weapons of anykind don't make good $
--The Good--
When you get used too aiming witchever weapon your using, you will destroy peeps. My kdr is 1.8.

2.-Tankers-
The first person to shoot wins 90% of the time. Flanking is recommended, Staying in one spot is not reccomended, infantry/tankers will hunt you.
The way this game is balanced goes like this | Tanks kill everything easy > < So infantry can easily kill tanks
As a tanker you WILL have anti tank infantry chase you all game on their cars/motorcycles and blow you up easily with various anti tank weaponry
Tanking can be frustrating and i believe new players who spend all their time grinding to get a tank may be dissapointed and quit the game.
Tanks cost money. light tanks $ > medium tanks/tank destroyers $$ > heavy tanks $$$.
If you die too much as a expensive tank, You will lose money.
--The Good--you can completley destroy everything you see
I once got over 100 kills with the starting machine gun tank.

3.-Airplanes-
Biplanes are really slow and easy to shoot down | however they are cheap and the best money making plane
fighter airplanes are really hard to aim.       | It will take along time to learn to fly effectively
Heavy aircraft are huge targets and very expensive 
Just like tanks, if someone is behind you, death is almost 90% certan.
Can get outnumbered big time
Can lose money if you die alot many times
--The Good--
Killing enemy aircraft and sucsessfull bombing is very rewarding. (not $wise)

--------Stuff-----------
1.Versatility
You can play as infantry witch have multiple different weapon types | smg, assault rifles, sniper rifles, mines, anti tank.
You can play as a tanker and choose from iconic ww2 tanks and airplanes from each faction
light tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, tank destroyers. | biplanes , fighter planes , heavy planes.
Randomness often leads to competely random and sometimes funny encounters
Friends can make this game very enjoyable. Games will go by faster so you will make $ faster subcounsiously. (because your having fun)
If your good enough you can single handidly take points, rambo style.

2.Grinding is a huge part of this game if you arent willing to throw $$$. (note $$$ has negligable effect on winning, aka not pay 2 win)
You mainly get payed by your soldiers hourly rate and small bonuses. As you level your hourly rate increases. (like a real job)
A level 15 makes 14100 credits an hour. An American M1/M2 Carbine costs 183,000
At 14100 credits per hour, It would take you about 13 hours of ingame play.(note you always make more than your hourly rate due to bonuses. It should be shorter than 13 hours)
You will lose money as a tanker/airplane if you die too many times. Each vehicle has its own spawn in cost.

3.Unfortinet situations
Some games you will get completely owned witch usualy goes like this.
--Infantry--Spawn > Run Foward > try to aim & shoot > Die > Repeat
--Tanker--  Spawn > Drive > search for a target> tank/infantrykills you > Repeat 
If you die too many times you LOSE money.(depending on tank)
--Pilot--   Spawn > fly towards enemy plane > miss every shot> Die > Repeat
If you die too many times you LOSE money.(depending on aircraft)
Stalemates will occur with tanks/snipers shooting anyone who tries to move foward.
Times like this can be extremely frustrating and i believe many new players have quit over this happening to them often.

4.Aiming
Aiming can be difficult. Iron sights, Recoil, and Smoke are something that takes along time to get used to.
I suspect many new players quit because of this aswell. But if you stick with it you will get better.

5.Teamates/Teamwork/Noobs
US faction has the most noobs who do not care about the objective and do noob things.
RU faction has the least amount of players, has less noobs than US
GE faction has the most experienced players, often going for the objective, good at flying/tanking/aiming. However once noobs see how good germany does, The noobs switch to german faction making GE have a decent amount of noobs.
If you're a tanker, rarely anyone will help defend your tank regardless of faction. Only friends will help you there.
Someplayers gave no idea what they are doing and do unpredictable actions.
Lots of people don't want to run back to their point thats being taken, often leading to losing every point.

----Conclusion----
I did not like this game when my friend first introduced it to me, aiming is difficult to get used to and it takes time to unlock new gear.
But the longer i played the better i got and i found myself really enjoying this game.
If you want a free 2 play ww2 first person shooter and you enjoy grinding to get new equipment and have friends to play with, You should try this game out.

Awsome WW2 game. It takes some time to get something great but when you have that thing it really is an awsome game. I must give an anger warning but still its a great game. 10/10
i like this game a lot but i think you should add more maps, here is some suggestions:

1. open map. a map that is a huge open field thats surrounded buy woods
2. trench map. map again open, but with trenches, so it needs more coop based attack to capture points
I love this game. I always will play this game. But this game needs to have voice chat! I am a medic most of the time and when people wobble around not standing still so I can heal them, so that their guts don't spill out of their sides (this has happened way to much.) I have an idea to fix this and offer an interesting idea; Have proximity voice. So you can tell other people useful info, but have that ONLY so people of your faction can hear, (A Russian isn't gonna know what a German is saying and a American isn't gonna know what a German is saying, etc.) and offer another utility so that you can relay messages towards the Generals/2nd Lieutenant/Radios at control points/Other troops with the utility of your faction. So with the utility, a US Army item would be this ---> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ca/Scr300.png Germans would have ---> http://63.135.101.110/d-m-propics/DIR_DRA/DRA75015/C_DRA75015_00.jpg And the Soviets got ---> https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/%D0%A0%D0%90%D0%94%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%90%D0%9D%D0%A6%D0%98%D0%AF_%D0%90-7.jpg/1024px-%D0%A0%D0%90%D0%94%D0%98%D0%A1%D0%A2%D0%90%D0%9D%D0%A6%D0%98%D0%AF_%D0%90-7.jpg

(Yes I did the research, these where in WW2) Please put these in the next update, It sounds like a good idea to me at least.
Really nice game for anyone who likes WW2 concept games. It's fun to jump into huge battles and either camp on hills with a sniper or rush capture points with an infantry soldier. It does take quite a while to get some decent weapons but once you've got something you like it's easy to get first on the leader board. My advice is focus on one thing only that you want at the start, because it'll be hard to grind for lots of things at the start. It takes too much time but once you've got a couple of soldiers and with good gear, you're basically good to go on whatever you want to do in the game. It'll be much much easier to grind credits with decent gear, you don't even need to have amazing weapons, just have some smg with high rpm and you're going to get lots of credits per game. But if being just a man with a gun isn't enough for you, you can get in a tank and take on the enemy from long ranges with high explosive rounds or get into fights with other tankers. And if being on the ground ins't enough for you, jump into a plane and bombard the enemy with a birds eye view. There is so much to do in H&G and so many different ways to do it. Hope this review helped someone.
Amazing game to play with your guy friends or tomboyish girl friends.
Still learning how to react to things fast enough and how to aim properly but so far this game is enjoyable.
It does lag a little bit though if you have a low ping in server.
Ok, so this game is not Pay to win losers...
Also it's not laggy just your potatoes are rotten.

The game is difficult and that's why it's realistic...They update this game alot and give us alot of features like new Vehicle update is insane. Tanks are more realistic then in real life.

Also people say matches are short..No way no shit i would say, mostly i play one match for 2 hours and have some fun experience.
Also it's not hard to get money at all.. i get about 10-25k a match that takes like 10-30 minutes.
You can get 100-200 k money in 5 hours playing.

For me this game is very good and i play it everyday when i can so please shut up you spoiled 7 year old kids with your Pay to win and other problems.
And creators give free memberships like every month with voucher code and you can get veteran (membership) with in game money so where is that pay 2 win ?

Every weapon is good and planes/tanks are so realistic. You can pilot plane while your friend is sitting behind you using machine gun. All machineguns on tanks or other vehicles are usable. You can use them and shoot others. Alot of games have guns on vehicles only for visuals.

If they add ships in the future then this game will be insane galaxy because Reto is awesome.
AND YOU GET ALL THIS FOR  FREE  SO OTHER CREATORS LIKE UBISOFT WOULD MAKE THIS GAME LIKE 20$ Or more.
Be thankful !!!!!!

Forgot one thing: You can become general and play in strategy mode command your army and troops in world map, very cool.

Mostly i love paratroopers in this game. Very fun to play with paratrooper.
Hope you enjoyed my review :D

Also audio is another beautiful thing in this game that almost none other game have.
When you drive or walk through bushes you heard leaves sounds and when plane turns you can hear wind sounds hitting wings.

AWESOME AND EVERYTHING FOR FREE.
Heroes and Generals is the enjoyable game, especially if you have friends that are ready to spend some time with you in the fields of WW2. I don’t really understand why a lot of players say it’s pay2win – come on, you can buy EVERYTHING can be purchased with the game currency. A lot of the other devs are much greedier than the developers of H&G, actually. I personally liked the game because of its cool concept and features, so if you have any doubts, just download and try it, you may like it.
Love this game, free to play and fairly realistic. Very engaging progression system that keeps you coming back, I've been playing for years but had to create a new account to play, loosing all my unlocks, because this game uses a bit of hardware which my old pc couldn't handle and the servers for this game were absolute crud and is still not the best.
Let's talk about price to gain here, You go anywhere and spend a couple of dollars and you can get what, two energy drinks? A cup of fancy coffee? Or how about several hundred hours worth of progression and gameplay in a virtual WWII world that's better Than Battlefield V.
This game is really fun and i would recommend it to most people. although i will say when you first start out it can be kin of rage quit since you only have a rifle and it takes a while to level up your character to use better weapons.
I was once under the impression that people who complained about being banned were actually people just moaning about getting caught, however having played this game for a very long period of time and giving the developers a sizeable amount of money in memberships, I logged in yesterday to find my account had been banned forever. If you are reading this review thinking "here is another cheater who got busted", consider this why would I have clocked up 3000 hours of play time not cheated to one day think to myself I know, I will risk all the hours of grinding to cheat on this game..does that make sense?? NO! It just so happened that I had purchased a very lengthy "Veteren membership" package that cost a fair amount of money before being banned. I appealled the ban but was told:

"Your Heroes & Generals account has been permanently banned for using cheats/hacks.
We are not obligated to provide you with any information as to how you were caught.
Your account will therefore remain banned.
We will not be discussing the matter with you any further."

Full conversation here: https://i.imgsafe.org/11a75be371.jpg

If you think I am lying about this, have a google this is actually how they speak to people with a genuine request for a proper investigation. All I asked for was them to look into the records and have a look because I must have been banned in error and I was also concerned that other members may also get unfairly banned, they simply do not care.

The game was pretty decent and very addictive, play it by all means, but remember this....

NEVER EVER GIVE RETO MOTO A SINGLE PENNY OF YOUR MONEY!

==========================================================

Quick Update:

I have put in 2 Paypal Cases against Reto, I do not hold any hope of getting my money back, but as long as it locks up some funds on their account while the case is open that good enough.

All the developers responses to this review came to nothing, they just want to make it look like they actually care in public but when communicating  privately they do not show any sort of real willingness to help at all, it is all for show.

I have signed up for a new Heroes and generals account played around 8 hours using the same computer no changes what so ever and have no been banned, which makes me think that this ban is some sort of scam, I think they ban people who have achieved all they can in the game in the hope that they will start from scratch and invest more money. If it is not a scam and then could the case that they cannot admit that their anti cheat software doesn't work, because they would have to unban everyone.

==============================================================

Further Update:

I have won 2 Paypal Cases against Reto Moto and I have recieved my money back for that, shame thats only probably 5% of what I have given them, but something is better than nothing I guess.

================================================================

The usual canned reply non-sense from reto was receive as a comment on this review:

Please be aware that I emailed them and they did not respond, so they make these statements in public to make it look like you are guilty, but when you do email them they offer no assistance nor do they provide evidence because they can't, they have none:

Reto.Robotron3000 [Entwickler] 10. Aug. um 9:21 Uhr 
You have multiple instances where your account, while playing, had software modifying the running game, poking around and changing things. NO legit software does this.

There is absolutely no reason for us to ban players who do not cheat.

You can contact me via mail directly at jd@heroesandgenerals.com and I'll take a deeper look in the log files.

======================================================================

Additional info:

Two years has passed since I wrote this review on Heroes & Generals in that time I have played the game for many hours and never been banned, they have recently incorpated BatleEye anti cheat system, which many games use, it's no surpise to me that they now use the new anti cheat system, as I though, their own anti cheat system did not work and provides further proof that my ban was no justified in the first place and the scummy developers can't even be bothered helping out the players of their game. Well I guess it karma that the player figures for this game have fallen off a cliff and this game will soon no longer be a viable project and I hope every single one of them loses their job and cannot find work in the industry again, having been part of a failed game that treats their customers with such disdain.
I have played this game to the point I know it inside out. I have patiently waited for 4 years for it to improve and  for issues to be fixed but it has got progressively worse. The main issue is the pay to win free to play model.  It totally sucks. After playing for 2488 hours over about 5 years or more I got sick of having to use in game earnings on anti tank ammo and ammo for my guns.   As a example of this ...you see two enemy tanks ..but you decide to not destroy them and go to cap point instead simply as you dont want to have to pay for the expensive ammo to destroy them.  This totally spoils the game as it puts you off using grenades that are expensive...makes you deliberately not take some kills as you think of costs involved.  Yes at higher ranks which i was you can earn enough to break even but still it spoils feel of game as you always thinking about costs involved before you kill a enemy.  
Graphics - these are old now and not very good.  The engine is dated and as they use there own engine I believe it really is showing its age now.
Maps - you quickly get sick of the same maps especially the ones where you are limited to say 3 ways to cross a river where enemy can just camp the other side and you cant get across which is no fun at all. They have never fixed this and seem happy to frustrate players as they spend the whole game tring and dying to get across a river which is both boring and frustrating.  Yes I am experienced enough to know how to sneak across and flank etc but this puts off new players and many who dont have infinite patience to keep trying to sneak across. With a good few squads often no enemy can get across if I camp which is boring for both sides.
Pay to win - the model for this game is totally broken...making you pay for ammo and to repair vehicles and weapons after a match is a joke as it totally spoils the game as you hold back on firing or using ammo etc or vehicles due to cost this is very apparent in the generals mode where often you wont want to use your own troops for many battles as loss will cost you lots of in game money /currency / war funds. 
My advice is ....if your going to grind for hundreds of hours to get things that are actually worth something to you then do overtime in real life for real money instead and use the extra cash to get a top end gaming pc and spen 30 pounds on a tripple A title that is worth playing where when you fire a gun you dont have to think about how much each bullet is costing you or the fact that you may have to repair parts of the gun at end of match.  

"They were too busy focusing on whether they could, that they forgot to think whether they should."

Oh, this game has gone downhill so fast, so much that playing it now is painful.

What they hell happened to "Help us make the game you want to play", developers?

Ever since Devyatayev update around 6-7 months ago (the infamous Squad 2.0 update), this game has gone further and further down the drain, whilst you constantly tell us that it's "Working as intended", which is a blatant lie based on the general consensus of the playerbase, well, what's left of us. 

I think "Working as  intended" should become your new tagline.

To give any potential user some basic background information, they first locked changing between squads, so if you were, for example in an Infantry Squad, you couldn't either switch to another Infantry Squad or a Squad of a different class (Tanker, Pilot, Recon or Paratrooper). 

The addition of the Auxiliary seats makes no difference, mostly because you have to grind to unlock them, and they are set by the Squad leader, who could be a level 0 soldier (when you have a level 17 soldier a few xp off becoming a general). To make matters worse, the game then became full of paranoid players who wouldn't use said seats for fear the Squad Leader would kick them from the Squad (and this does happen).

You also locked weapons in combat, and removed captured weapons from the store. Locking weapons in combat was a fair move as it was a bug that people could, for example, swap their SMG on one soldier for a sniper rifle if needed, but you gave us no option to move weapons between characters, which you have been promising for a while now.

Then came Evenhart, where you added a load of unwanted 'Immersion changes', which just means it takes 1.7 years to get out of your tank (making anti-tank infantry even easier to play as), and give you motion sickness when zooming from first to third person view.

Then came Furness, where you 'Balanced' the tanks (it's not even close to balanced), and then added the 'Player Journey' add-on, which made changing classes for newer soldiers impossible, so you are now forced to buy them.

Then came Garmen, which revamped all the maps (instead of just the capture zones), making each map essentially the same (mostly forest with some urban combat at the centre), and mae it so you spawn in the middle of the woods with no vehicles.

Then came Hallowes, which closed off windows on houses (making roofs essentially unreachable camping spots for paratroopers), decreased the base salary and nerfed the M1/M2 carbine and MG42 into the ground, instead of to in-line with the other weapons.

Then came Ihlefeld, which introduced a massively reworked piloting system that makes flying the old planes nigh-on impossible, and getting a good score (hence a profit) pretty much impossible. Also came a load of undocumented price increases - 541k for a Level 0 Recon is insanity.

Sure, the latest update is decent, but all it really does is add in even more expensive things for players to grind in. If you hadn't introduced all the flaws in the game, I would be singing high praise for it - indeed I used to.


It's so sad to reminisce about how the game used to be even just a year ago, when you truly cared about your playerbase and promised us future updates (new factions, bipods, more vehicles and weapons and maps and so on), but now we can plainly see you only care about making a profit.
[h1]My opinion on the game[/h1]
This is an updated version of my first review. I can no longer recommend this game as it went worse and worse for the past year and a half. I no longer have fun playing H&G and question the decisions Reto.Moto took during that time span.
Heroes & Generals is a F2P WW2 game with a vast variety of weapons, vehicles, camouflages, planes and tanks. This is most likely the best WW2 game you can get in its category. However I have a few things to address before you start getting into the game.

[h1]This game is not meant for casuals.[/h1]
As a new player, you will find yourself thrown in a massive pit of doom as soon as you hit Gold MM (after 10-15h of playtime from my own experience) because everyone is rocking better weapons and better badges than you.

[h1]My opinion on veterans[/h1]
This game is based on a F2P formula, so of course there will be veterans/ premium players. If you are skilled enough and have decent game awareness you'll do just fine. So I consider that not being a real issue (it will be hard but it's possible).

[h1]My opinion on the matchmaking system[/h1]
This is by far the biggest problem with this game, some people will say it's the grind but to me it's who you are MM'd with and agaisnt. And it goes both ways: New players struggle against experimented veterans and veterans struggle with new players as they have little to no game sense/ game knowledge due to the lack of in-game tutorials. Sure you can watch videos but there was a time where you could train on a map of your own (the First Blood map). Such map was removed 2 updates ago and can now only be triggered once per account (if they didn't change it this update).

I didn't quite realize it myself since I've been playing Heroes & Generals for around 2 years. I recently decided to start a new account, not understanding the complains of some people. To me it was just fine, I made my credits, I got a lot of kills and influenced games a lot since I pushed myself to cap (since most of the new players will tend to grind for weapons, ribbons, badges, etc. and camp). 

Then I started the new account, I was doing just fine for the 2 first ranks, I even found it more enjoyable to play as everyone had the same loadouts, to me it felt balanced. [u][b]BUT THEN I REACHED GOLD MM[/b][/u]. Alright it wasn't that bad because I know this game (people tend to over exaggerate), but it was still harder than I expected and I can only emphasize what new players are going through.

In my opinion, leveling up from Bronze to Gold should take twice the time it takes now. New players get thrown in too soon against veteran players. People will tell me: "Git gud" or "Learn to play" or even "The salt on that one is real", but there is a thin line between not being skilled enough and not being geared enough. I'm expecting to reach Gold MM when I maxed out at least one loadout (starter weapons for example).
 
[h1]My opinion on the Grind[/h1]
What did you expect, it's a free to play game. I've never really complained about this part of the game so I have little knowledge about what's going on. All I can tell is that prices for some items are really weird/ not logical. But I guess it's the way Reto wants to go in order to limit the appearance of such items in the game (ex: people running with MG42, M1/M2, AVS on Bronze MM). The only thing I could recommend is to increase salaries back to the previous build in order to be more new player friendly. 

[h1]My opinion on Reto.Moto[/h1]
I don't want to lynch the devs for everything that is wrong with this game. It's a small company, they do what they can to provide us fun content. It can take them very long to push an update with little content and it saddens me to see people discrediting Reto for any little issue this game has. 

But, sometimes I feel like Reto and the community aren't on the same page. 

For example, the new plane update was nothing like I expected, what everyone expected. We were expecting, for example, p51 for the US, Bf110 for the Germans, Pe-3 for the SU. But instead we got recon planes which have no influence on a battle. They literally just shoot each others and that's it. Even if really fun to play, they can't bring anything else on a battle because of how weak (armor and firepower) they actually are.

Another example, they made it impossible to get on roofs now. I remember seeing myself on B2 on Forward Airfield trying to shoot down paratroopers camping on the roofs (because you can cap points on roofs which is stupid now that they removed the ability to counter it). And dont get me started about attic capping.

There are many other things like that and sometimes I wonder if Reto even fully test its game before pushing an update.

Moreover, Reto ninja nerfs features they don't mention in patch notes. Last time it was the credits earned per battle (which has now been explained unofficially), the window example explained above, etc.

On the bright side, Reto is making a lot of progress in order to address these issues (prototype server, gathering community feedback, etc.) and I can see them improve overtime.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
As I said, this game wasn't made for casuals. Don't play this game in order to achieve or unlock things but play it for what it was meant to be, [u][b]FOR FUN[/b][/u]. And if you can overcome the first hours of grind, this is actually quite a decent WW2 game. Maybe even the best in its category. You can play with many different weapons, drive jeeps, halftracks and trucks, pilot tanks and planes, parachute behind enemy lines, etc. And the maps are huge. Sure it might be not so well optimized but I don't hear a lot of complains from people playing this game on a decent computer.

The least you can do is give Heroes & Generals a try, it's free and who knows, you might like it.


[i]PS: Sorry for the long review, I have no idea how to attach an image of a potato so you'll have to deal with it![/i]
Great game concept with an awesome unique selling point. But the Devs really don't like criticism of any sort, even if it is constructive. The updates that do happen are full of bugs, but do not generally address existing ones... So close to being a perfect ww2 game, but its slowly sliding downhill. Hopefully the devs shape up and I can change my review back to positive.

--------------------------------------------------------------------- 
[b]This game was really fun before but those developers don`t care about the game they only care about milking around 2k players and that horrible because they are going to kill there game while the game can be fixed and boost its player base by 70% atleast through some easy changes :	[/b]

1- Make grind easier at least for low tiers so they dont hit a wall and leave the game before they try or enjoy it 
; credits grind is not much bad but rank /ribbons system sucks 

2-Soldiers should run more then 5 secs make it 20 secs atleast 

3-Anti tank is really expensive and useless ; light tank need 2 mines or 4 H3 - meduim 3 mines  - heavy = more  and thats a total joke specially when AT options are expensive !!!

4-Scopes are very blurry  and narrow, why ???

5-Add at least 2 civilian trucks for skirmish or decrease spawn time and make atleast 1 truck around every capture point in large battles

6-Remove bikes or make them usefull  (atleast make it like before ) 

7-Make a field for testing weapons with option to customize weapon mods so players can be familier with there weapons and try whats good with em 

8-Remove medic resupply boxes and make it back from ammo crates or increase medic resupply points 

9-Respawn unvisibility is very wierd and looks bad with grey color just make a nice icon over spawners so every one know they are spawning and cannot be killed unless they start firing
This game has been my number 1 recomendation to everyone of my friends. I've spent countless hours hunting tanks for guns that are bigger than I am, flying co-op with a pal and shooting planes out of the sky, Shooting planes out of the sky with a 6 foot long bullet accelerator (PTRD), and going on HUGE Killstreaks deep in enemy territory, but this is ths last straw... I've stuck with this game through the best and worst time, and there have been many. i have so many fond memeries of the "good old days" where guns were fun, AND fair. I could see the guns in the menu and i felt that drive to unlock them all. and i did eventually, but as the games age increases, so do the prices of guns and vehicles, pushing this game farther and father away from Free To Play. the updates are getting less interesting and less frequent. In the most recent update on October 1, 2018 they tried to solve the aparent problem with uninteresting tanks, they atempted to mimic the armor modles in war thunder, to make it more interesting. but with the tanks more "tanky-er" the chances of an infantry being able to kill them in 0 to none. it went from a 2-3 RPG kill to a 5+ RPG kill, and because your computer is having to calculate all the armor equations, your FRAME RATE DROPS. i used to get around 200-230 FPS, now im barely scratching 120 FPS. In the update, they also tried to make the vehicle physics more realistic by adding different terrains that effect the speed and handling of the vehicles. Now this sounds great on paper, but NONE of the maps were designed for this. im constantly stuck in mud or my tank can't make it up a hill that it used to be able to climb easily. because the infantry cars now have to sick to the roads to get anywhere in decent time, the tanks know exactly where they will be coming from.  every update  seems to just keep adding to the pile of balance and prefomance, and FUN issues that the game has had since the alpha. the more i play this game the more the charm wears off. im no longer blinded by the "Good Old Days" of Relentless fun and variety. And all i see now is the STG, and the MP40 spam. tanks that kill right out of spawn. an obvious German bias, and the final dash of salt in my WW2 wound, the lack of respect shown to Veteran players who know the game better than the devs themselves. all they do i cater to the players with 5 hours that complain because they died to a sniper that they didnt see, and they ignore the players who call them out on HUGE game breaking issues because they are too hard to fix. To summ everything up, I will no longer be an advocate for H&G, ill never recomend it to anyone. the buisness practices that they are starting will continue to lead this game further away from the Heroes and general that i fell in love with. im Officially done with H&G, after 4 years and 1800 hours. im done....       RIP Heroes and Generals  2013-2018
This game has just been cleared for release, and as a long term player who's checked then and there every passng update (all the way part from mid-2014 when the Open Beta started, and significantly before the Steam Beta) I cannot agree with that

There are still significant issues everywhere :

- The grind is unbearable, and requires you to spend 100 hours brainlessly playing game after game for minimal returns. Everything is grindable, the levels, the credits, the guns, the explosives, the ribbons, the vehicles, the badges, the attachments, the assault teams, even your knife (which you don't get in any capacity until 5 levels of a ribbon). It's the bad kind of grinding and forces you to play with awful gear for 50 hours before you get the really meta loadouts. Even significant experience at FPS skills will get you so far if you're using a NERF gun against a laser gun
- The Strategy Game is unplayable until 50 hours of grinding... or for a one time fee of 50 DOLLARS (or local equivalent plus tax and handling). It's blatant what they are going for, and even if you decide to grind your way here, the AT deploy queues mean you literally have one shot at playing Generalisimo before it's game over for literal days. And for that matter, you'll have to wait days to deploy your ATs if you're not in for the first hour of the war
- The Action Game has been left equally broken, you have to sprint hundred of meters but all your characters have severe asthma and will explode if you sprint more than 10 meters, meaning his iron sights will fly everywhere. The spawn points are fixed and sometimes have no cover between them and the objective, meaning sniper and tank galore. Sometimes enemy spawn points are DIRECTLY in the way to the objective. The physics engine randomly breaks and will sometimes instantly kill you if you gently bump into something with a vehicle, or send your car to do a sick 180° wheelie when you tried to gently steer right
- There are still horribly powerful equipments that break the entire game, and which are -thoughfully- locked behind walls of grinding... or a small fee of etc. M1/M2 Carbine is basically a modern assault rifle out of nowhere, Chaffee and Hellcat outperform all other tanks due to speed beating armor (bad game mechanics there), the Soviets get a Tank Destroyer disguised as an APC and the PTRD which can one-shot vehicles and infantry which makes it more of a .50 cal rifle than anything, all factions have access to OHK Rifles that ruin the balance and allow you to bodyshot kill soldiers from across the map, LMGs can be hipfire spammed when standing and moving, etc. Will never be addressed, because of all the kids who max their credit card to buy the big bad toys.
- Most of the higher mechanics are horribly unpolished. Backcapping is a valid strategy because caps capture so fast that a single soldier on a motorbike can lock 8 players going for the next point, and no-one defends because you are PUNISHED for it. Literally spamming a car at every spawn is a perfectly valid tactic, and even preferable because "clown cars" are prime targets for tanks sniping across the map and OHK snipers taking potshots at the targets, etc.
- Tanking and Flying are both unrefined. Tankers will quickly find a deathly hate for the so called "AT Rambos", and literally every soldier has an AT nade in its pockets, meaning tanks are relegated to sniping from across the map with HE shells, and of course anti tank. APCR makes armor useless, meaning the King Tiger and the small light tanks with a tiny cannon are about as viable in a direct confrontation. Flying is fine, but clearly they've never doublechecked the XP since I get insane amounts of it for doing nothing useful, and there's still blatant unbalances (German plane gets one bomb, the others get two. No idea why, you go ask them because the Junker is certainly not a beast with MGs OR airborne handling). As for the idea of bombers, close air support, fighter split ? You'd wish.
- A lot of promises and excellent suggestions went literally nowhere over two years. I remember seeing mortar loading slides in the earliest stages of the pre-Steam Beta, those don't exist. Artillery doesn't exist in any capacity either. AA trucks exist apparently, not that you'll see them often. Suggestions for Medic and AT classes to split up the omnipotent Infantry went nowhere. The "factory AT production" got turned into a global and awfully scaled AT production queue. And you are still stuck in 20 v 20 when most maps have four flanks open (only two in Staged because closing a flank nukes all your ATs on that front) which could easily fit a humongous 64 v 64. New maps like special capital maps, naval landing maps, coast maps, more town variations (took them two years to fix the 10-ish maps they had). Oh, and yeah, the promise of "battleships" they just threw out at the recent dev stream. As if that's gonna happen, a whole naval game out of the blue when we can't even get close to finishing the land or air one

The concept is sound, the execution is not. These two years of open beta have been a rollercoaster of bad and good, but now it's just a clusterf**k that is only playable if you are lucky enough to be matched with the right players who don't abuse literally every tactic at their disposal, against 10 Recons that sit across the map instantly killing you unless you're driving in a car (and even then, I've trained to shoot out drivers as a Recon), against 10 Paratroopers that will cap the point behind you and drive you out of the map before you can even sprint your way back.

The development team is incredibly silent and does not appear particularly stressed to adress the foul peasants who are writing long, argumented, researched posts detailing the flaws in the game, instead focusing on adding more overpowered equipment to make people buy it for real cash. Zero communication from the dev team, if the game was broken to the point where people fell out the map every time they spawned we'd be surprised to even see a tweet from them.

I cannot see this game being playable for another year, and that is they fix every item on this list, and don't just wall themselves in silence and pretend nothing bad is occuring.

Edit : Since this has received a surprising amount of attention, I went around and clarified a few points, also I have to say it clearly. The sticking point why I don't recommend this game isn't just "gun X or gun Y is overpowered", but the fact even getting a single clarification or promise from the devs on what they plan to do hinges on the miracle. A quick scan of their own official forums shows devs literally never answer to threads as far as the eye can see, despite the low post traffic that makes it perfectly manageable.

Edit 2 : If you've not been annoyed by AT Deploy Queues because you're not even close to that stage yet, then the queues to GET TO PLAY THE GAME should do the trick, wherever logging in or the insane lobby delays (didn't talk about the matchmaker, but it's not great). I can't even tell what the idea behind this nonsense is. Servers overloaded ? Put more online. You've gotten money from your store for the better of two years, and now you have tons of new players which -might- consider it too, if ever they can play. Just, why ?
dont even bother with this game you play by there rules and you still get banned for cheating/hacking and they dont even provide proof that you did such a thing, its a bloody scam £150 down the drain.
I've spend 78h in this game, mostly playing with friend, mostly doing hand anty-tank infantry. Pretty fun when done with friend. Driving like crazy on motobike to tank from behind then planting anti-tank granades and watching it blow.
Then we both got suddendly banned for "farming experiencepoitnts". My first thought was what's going on?! Checked email. There was no email, no warning, just instant perma ban on account. I wrote to support, got message back that I violated Terms of Use, because we were farming experience points... And that's being treated by them on same as cheaters are... That's ridicolous... 
First thing, I'm Polish and I read entire translated polish ToS before even starting to play this game. I usually do when playing multiplayer games. I have found none entry about "farming experience" in any part of it. Nowhere. Checked again after ban. Not a single entry.
Second thing, how can you be so arbitraty to ban PERMAMENTLY, without any warning or leisser punishment, without proper information on email, players that are playing to grind in F2P game? Since when playing to grind became considered by any community (of players, not of devs) considered to be bad thing? They created a model that you can for fee of in-game real-money currency pay to get grind quicker, so it hurts them when someone does grind and they ban him. That stands for pretty pathetic, arbitrary dev. Problem of players grinding could be solved in diffrent, more friendly to consumer way instead of banning peps, when you don't like their own worked solution to grind in poorly designed system.
Good game 7/10, Devs -3/10, total 2/10. I do not recommend.
[h1]Don't bother.[/h1]
This game, while I've not sunk much time into it, is not something that I'd recommend a friend.

Quick pro/con table.

Pro:
- Great presentation.

...
[i]That's all. Nothing else.[/i]
Now I'll provide the cons and a brief explanation.

Con:
- The grind. Dear lord, the grind.
- Terrible gunplay.
- Little variety.
- Devs, while active, don't care for criticism, and therefore little is done for issues.

----
[b]Why?[/b]
Well, I'll start with the positive:
This game is presented remarkably. The promise of multiple classes, exciting gameplay and [b]teamwork[/b] are toted as selling points. This shows in game; although just for laughs.

The 'class'(role) system in place for the game is nicely done. Playing something other than basic infantry gives you a sense of actually contributing, although that's deceiving and certainly not the case; as I'll soon expand on.

While looking good, the gameplay isn't anything fantastic. Actually getting into the game and playing for a few minutes will show this. All effects from the trailers/presentations are not in game, sans [i]maybe[/i] dirt spray. It's been gutted, and few things promised have been delivered. Whether this is due to engine limits or false promises is not known, and we'll never receive an answer from Reto.

[i]Well, what about teamwork?[/i]
Unless you're playing over voice with multiple mates, don't bother searching for it.
I've only had one incident in game where someone even responded to text that I had tossed up.


-
[b]So, you just started playing: What now?[/b]
Nothing. Good luck getting into a game.
If you [b]somehow[/b] get into a game with a new account, you'll be shoehorned into the same map for many a games until you get tossed up a few levels... In which you'll immediately get slaughtered by players who have either spent money on the game, or just those that have had enough patience to grind.
Going up against those with fully automatic weapons or one hit kill weapons with a really dingy semi-auto rifle is no fun.
Nor is fighting a neverending onslaught of aircraft continually bombing your spawn, or a tank sitting just outside of AT reach; again, shooting into your spawn with no obvious counter.


[b]Well, the gunplay looks nice...[/b]
[b]BZZZZZZZ[/b]
No.
Go ahead and give the game a try, and you'll see why I hate to even expand on this.
No matter what you're using, every weapon of the same class feels the exact same. 

Garand, SVT and G43? Same thing, just seperate textures. They all feel like you're throwing stones at a tank, in which you may as well be doing against a higher level player.
Automatics? Same case, just slightly more money put into it.

Explosives? 
Can't even bother using them.
With how credits(non-premium currency) is handled in game, you'll be draining your account when using these.
AP mines are useless, and cost more than you'll get from kills.
Grenades are only good for spam and TKs, which you'll see if you play. A lot.

Other? 
Melee works. That's about it. Nothing special.


Besides the above complaints, the actual gameplay just feels god awful.
Possibly due to my case of extreme CTS, but I can't for the life of me figure out why this is.

[b]Roles must make up for the aforementioned negatives then, no?[/b]
No, they don't.
I'll break down the classes as best I can, although I'm sure to miss something; regardless of a positive or negative.
-
[i]Infantry[/i]
Other than recon, the only class you'll want to be playing.

You get a gun. You get your standard issue boots. You cap.
Repeat.
Maybe break the game with a bug or two. 
Die.
Repeat once more.

While you get access to all the 'fun' stuff, it really doesn't add up to much.
[i]Unless you AT rambo.[/i]
-
[i]Paratrooper[/i]
Oh, you somehow got enough credits to pay for a new class? 
Nice. Too bad you'll likely give up on it.

Infantry with less equipment to use. That's it.
Oh, and an air spawn on almost any location.
Again, that's it. Nothing else to it.

You used to be able to control where the aircraft that ferried you went, but no longer is that the case.
Too much fun to be had, or bugs. Either is as sad.
-
[i]Recon[/i]
You get a one hit kill weapon(After a grind out the rear, or paying from your wallet), and the ability to spawn an AFV.
Of course, the AFV is the only thing you'll be using it for; unless you're a tree fairy.
Other than the skin and somewhat out of place role, there's nothing else to this class other than paying for it. Glorified infantry.

-
[i]Tanker[/i]
Other than infantry, the only real and reliable way to make credits.

Drive to a point with your starting machine-gun armed tank.
Shoot infantry.
Repeat until you gain enough points for a real tank.
Buy said real tank.
Get AT Rambo'd repeatedly by everyone and their 'nan.
Wonder why the devs haven't balanced tank gameplay, or given them a proper role other than AT fodder.

You're basically a giant moving pillbox with a "[b]KILL ME[/b]" sign strapped to the side and rear.
The maps don't even accommodate for these vehicles, and a majority of them can't even be used.
[i]Looking at you, TDs. :( [/i]


-
[i]Pilot[/i]
Oh, you've bought this? 
k
I pray you saved up enough to get anything other than the 'recon' planes, otherwise you're in for a remarkably terrible grind.

Aerial combat is a joke. Those without HE rounds to instantly KO the other pilot will suffer terrible pains.
Besides dying, you can't do a single thing once someone gets onto your tail.
Teammates? Nice joke.

Bombing - you'll probably enjoy this the most out of aircraft; assuming you don't pass out from 'exciting' gamelpay.
It's simply nothing more than fly towards dots on the ground, press space, and fly away. Repeat as needed until you cause the entire enemy team to leave due to spawn bombing.
Oh, and there's no counter to you... besides [i]maybe[/i] that one AA emplacement at the rear of the map that can't even aim at you.




[i][b]JED[/b], surely the RTS side and generals must be good![/i]
Oh? You grinded/paid out the rear for this amazingly stylish dude?
Have fun with mobile-like wait times as you drag dots around the map.
As well, I hope you like having [i]your[/i] units used and wasted by players who occupy them.
[i]Looking at you, para-pilots.[/i]




[b]B-b-b-but... Reto?[/b]
While they put on the facade of caring about their community, they actually couldn't care less.
Complaints, suggestions and requests fall on deaf ears, Reto seemingly ignoring everything tossed towards their direction.
For years people have complained about not only the grind, but the following:

- Vehicle gameplay, specifically tanks and the problem of AT rambos.
- Credit related costs, and the blatant advantage that one gets for using their wallet.
- The distinct lack of balance involving [i]certain[/i] weapons and items in game.
- Costs for customization. Seriously. Weeks of grinding for the ability to paint your guy pea-soup green.
- Spawncamping.
- Little to no new maps in the last few years.
- Stagnated development.

What has been done? Little to nothing.
Besides Reto looking as if they're slowly getting better and on the right trek, nothing has improved.



[b]In short:[/b]
Don't.
I can't suggest anyone try this mobile-like game, and if you do, do so with caution.
Don't spend a single cent on this until they improve.


[h1]EDIT:[/h1]

(Edit of an edit? Yes. The link was dead; I've removed it.)

[h1]EDIT #2:[/h1]
Giving the game another go. It's been quite a while since I last played; review will be updated where required.
(2018-05-15)
I did love this game and I have atleast 100 hours on the browser game alone (Not counting on my Steam) But I logged in one day to find out I was banned for "hacking/cheating" I of course was very distraught and I wanted to ask them about it. I sent in a ticket asking if there was a way I could combat the perma ban and this was my response three days later.

Me:
I would firstly like to thank you for taking time to read my ticket. I would also like to say I do enjoy your game, it is very fun to play. 
 Today I went to log into the game and the screen says I have been perma banned for hacking, and I was wondering at what point did I hack the game? I have been playing to the best of my abilities and as far as I can tell, I have not used a hack in game to increase my abilities. Is there a way to combat this hacking charge or am I sh*t out of luck?

The only reason I am downvoting is because of their shitty ass support team that just cuts off when I have been loyal and they won't even try to give me any help whatsoever.
Howdy,

My first & only  steam review so bear with me, i simply want to post something on the current state of Heroes & Generals for those who have yet to play it and who might be tempted to put money into this so called FPS / RTS mix. 

H&G is a Free to Play - Pay To Win, FPS/ RTS game in a ww2 setting, sounds fun right ? well it was... it was a great game that i enjoyed playing for over 3k hours and put in some RL money (a regret in hindsight)... unfortunatly this game is being developed by a studio / company that i can only describe as incompetent. 

Reto (developers) used to have an active productive community that designed maps, layed out roadmaps, proposed balances to weapons and vehicles and weighed in on how people would have loved to see this game progress, Reto however went in the opposite direction... the "silent majority" direction (also known as the easy money grab direction).

After 3 years the same old bugs still remain unfixed, player options are limited (squad 2.0), the grind has been made infinite unless you buy gold, broken tank system, constant inbalance of weapons (buff / nerfs of weapons after every patch),RTS is broken, etc..

and with their most recent update they broke their own sound system.. i kid you not, RETO have implemented a feature called sound occlusion which is a fancy word for directional sound effected by enviroment...and its a sad joke... you cant tell where people are shooting from or even hear someone when someone is firing a MG42 right next to you...

for me this was "one feature to far"... the feature that broke the camels back if you will. 

So my advice to potential H&G players would be... try it out ! its free to play after all !

However dont sink any money into this game... save that RL money for games that are actually finished by people who know what they are dooing.  

Yours Truly,

-Caboose
A really fun, semi-persistant multiplayer WW2 combined-arms shooter that is buried under an insane level of grind and Pay-to-Win microtransactions, as well as unfortunate balance issues.

If I could buy this game for a flat price and have largely everything avaliable, only behind some reasonable character leveling, I would easily recommend this to everyone interested in a great, solid WW2 shooter. The shooting mechanics feel solid, and the infantry weapons are fun to use. Jumping into a game as a tanker is incredibly fun and tank combat feels interesting and rewarding. And if you join into a game with a couple friends, you can have an awesome multiplayer experience that reminds me of the fun I had with early Call of Duty and Battlefield games.

It all falls apart when you actually try to start unlocking new classes, equipment, weapons, and vehicles. The level of grind required just to level up becomes exceedingly tiresome, and it only gets worse when you look at the costs you're required to pay to then make use of that leveling up. You're expected to save several hundred games worth of credits for a single new item, and that's not considering the maintenance costs you pay for repairs and rearming.

That issue has a rippling effect on the rest of the game, as it is not uncommon to get into games that are quite simply impossible to win. A not-insignificant number of my games have been in situations where my team is a bunch of dudes with rifles against enemy tanks, planes, and soldiers with overpoweringly strong weapons. Since I've played a bit and managed to get a second character that is a tanker things have gotten a bit better, but I will still run into situations where it is hopeless as I'm a light tank against medium and heavy tanks, or the enemy has uncontested air superiority and bomb me whenever I try to push forward.

I sincerely hope the developers pay attention to these reviews, because this game can easily be made into something incredible with some simple changes to the leveling and in-game currency requirements. But as it stands, it's a great shooter ruined by an awful grind and pay-to-win tendencies.
I started playing this mid-2015 and i got to say that it was imensly fun at the time.

I created a new account mid-2017 to see how it would be to start new... I sooner regretted that decision

The amount of grind was just obsured and the 'new player experience' was just terrible. I remember specificly there being Tutorials for Infantry, it was just a small part of the map and you could choose different weapons from the game, there were AI enemys that were pretty fun to go against, It tought you the basic movement and gun controls, you would also get a certain amount of credits for completing it.. It wasnt much but it was much much more than they have today. They dont have any tutorials of any kind at all. Meaning you have first time players going up against Veterans who have been playing for years. Well if you could get into a game that is.

You start off with only one game mode availiable; just infrantry vs infantry on a small map, it would be fun if you could get into a game but since this game mode is very very unpopular as the other modes are the main part of the game (Infrantry, Air, Armor) leaving all the new players to wait 5-30 minutes to find 1 single match.

The first time i started this game; i remember getting the purchasable car within a few matches. Would you like a car now? Well get yourself ready for some heavy duty grinding as it would take hours to rank up your stupid driving ribbon so you can even unlock the car, but you need some credits to buy it. Put even more hours into grinding the obsured amount of credits you need for that car. When i first started playing you would get 10-40 thousand credits depending on how good you were every match, Probably even more. But now you only get 500-8k credits every match depending on how good you are.

The developers have some weird decisions in what they should focus on, they added helmet camos which have no impact to anything? When the game is so unbalanced with the US side having the better weapons, better armor, and the best plane in the game? With Soviets and Germans being week compared to the US. Unfair map layouts for attackers and defenders, The ridicoulous grind and the overly week tanks that get stomped on by other tanks of the same tier and 1 single Infrantry riding their bike up to you to place mines which blow up within 3 seconds of placing, leaving no time for the tankmen to react.

The added fact that every weapon, weapon modification, Vehicle, Tank, Plane costs credits every time you use them, you even pay for every bullet you shoot. Oh and they aint cheep; fully wearing out your tank can cost tens of thousands of credits to repair.

I am disapointed with how this game has been treated the past years and so are other people who have played for the same time or even longer than i have.

Stay away, Don't support these developers until, if they ever do, change their ways.
I played this game back when it was new, and it was actually fun. People drove jeeps for transportation, tanks attacked fortified objectives, planes fought eachother, and snipers actually needed an aim. BUT NOW people hip fire from miles away, jeeps roadkill constantly before teamkilling, and tanks sit on their asses all day before being fragged by paratroopers. If this game hadnt gone shit enough, they threw in 2 shot kill LMGs and adjusted the "fairness" of the gameplay. Naturally, every great game grows, and with that growth comes stupid decisions and inmature players, but thats usually fixed. However, these devs HAVE TRIED, but failed and continue to do so. Im sorry but this game is not for casual OR hardcore gamers. I do suggest you try it, for this is the opinion of a single man and others may experience differently, but this is merely a warning for newcoming players.
Ok, after putting a LOT of time and money into it:

I got perma banned on twitch for asking a simple question, without expressing my honest feeling about the newest "update", which is basically another deep downgrade after "Adams".

So I've still got a year of veterancy around, they treat the people that buy gold to support them like sh!t - because the people are never right and reto can't never ever be wrong.

I've bought the veterancy because I had faith that they won't clusterfuck the game and yet, they can dig even deeper.


[b]Here's a quick overview of the top 5 downgrades:[/b]

[olist]
[*]First Rommel, adding INSANE deployment queues for everyone.

[*]Then they added pooled resources, making 18 tanks vs 18 fighters possible - ohh keeeh... (fyi that's still possible via matchmaker)

[*]Somewhere along the way they screwed up the shaders...

[*]Adams: Adding some weird as hell cone fire - ok maybe, but: 
adding autoaim for idiots that cannot guess where a gun will shoot at while hipfiring when all the bullets HAVE TO leave the barrel; that stuff even introduced a shitload of WTF - Headshot?! "bugs".

[*]And now... Squad 2.whatever:
Could have been so easy, remove the class restriction on the squads add a "commo rose", so you can mix and command 'em like in Battlefield;
but nope, they had to do it the "right" way again - I'm cutting it short:
[list]
[*]removed the join friend functionality
[*]removed ability to pick a battle (can't even join your own ATs without a squad)
[*]making squads is now tied to ribbon progress - which is tied to a single soldier instead of a faction
[*]added horrific fun with the matchmaker (wooohooo we need moar ping)
[/list]
[/olist]

Final verdict: don't expect anything but letdowns all the way; 6 months ago, I'd have recommended the game to everyone, but now... forget it - leave the devs to their own ignorance.


Peace.
WARNING. Devs / Support ban legit players. After 210 hours, I got banned for 'cheating/hacking' as they said in my support ticket. If you are interested in knowing more about this, go here: http://pastebin.com/iUaj91aM but you can skip this and keep reading the review below.

If you have insane good matches and is a very experienced FPS player (you listen to footsteps, you react to sound, twitch aiming, etc.) The Dev / Support WILL watch replays and ban you if they receive complains from other players, like in my case. DO NOT DEAL WITH SUPPORT. It's pointless and the support sucks (the support team seems to be one single man, and is known to be a d**chebag). 

I won't even talk about the starter pack and the prices, it's a terrible business model just to save time and unlocks everything at a ridiculous price (Most expensive pack is at 100$+).

It's too bad because it is a very fun game to play and is amazingly fun if you get friends, but I guess my road ends here. If you still want to try this game out, be warned, anything can happen to your account.

Also:
-VERY bad hit detection (you can even see the guy bleed but you get no hit confirmed)
-Framerate on big maps can be horrible even on a big PC
-You need to refill grenades and rockets and they cost A LOT. It can be annoying for some if they want to save for a gun (which are also crazy expensive as well)
-1 Shot snipers are everywhere so get ready (you can quickly have access to those if you pay).
Before playing this game take a look at all recent reviews and you will see they are more or less all negative and the only reason this game is on MIXED is because this game USED to be good.

This game has been in development for over 5 years and there is still huge amount of problems. I will list just a few of them down below. 

Bad Netcoding.

Huge amount of Bugs/Glitches that takes years to fix.

Terrible optimized game end game pc's will have 200-300 fps in the beginng of a match and once all the players spawn and get close to one another the end game pc's will drop down to 60-80 fps on LOW GRAPHICS and medicore pc's will have 15-40 fps.

Insanely slow with the updates and when they finally do have an update it is just minor things like a new camouflage and a bunch of stupid balance changes that was unnecessary that nobody asked for.

Unbalanced weapons,Tanks,Planes and credit/gold prices between the 3 factions.

Insane grind (even if you pay money)

Unplayable for new players once they get out of the starting stage of the game because of the huge grind and veteran players will just instant kill them because of better Badges + Weapons.

Takes ages to find battles during the Morning/Night you will have to wait 20+ minutes to find a battle.

People abuse game mechanics and Reto don't care as long as the players abusing bring in the $$$.

Developers make the game worse by each update and all they think about is the $$$.

If you dont have friends that already play this game you should not waste your time on this still in "BETA" staged game.

The only reason this game is still not in beta is because the terms of service of steam prevented them (You are only allowed to have a game that is under BETA on steam for X amount of years or your game will get kicked out of the platform)
DO NOT - DO NOT - [b]DO NOT[/b] INSTALL THIS GAME. Even if you're playing with friends. Even if you want to spend money on it. DO NOT DO IT. This kind of game CANNOT BE SUPPORTED.

With the latest patch, people who do not outright buy weapons and equipment have to grind 300-400% longer for their gear. You need thousands upon thousands of hours to buy the equipment needed to even compete in this game now. Reto, the company who develops this game, admits their intention to make it impossible to get gear other than to spend money on it and offer NO EXPLANATION OR JUSTIFICATION outside of that. They are basically admitting to treating the majority of their consumers like dirt and are not even trying to shy away from that fact. They know it, they know that we know it, but all they care about is $$$.

Basically, the biggest slap in the face you can imagine. Not even EA can match this level of dastardly.

This kind of behavior is unacceptable and other developers needs to know this kind of attitude towards customers and consumers is UNACCEPTABLE. This game NEEDS TO DIE in order to get that message through. Please rate my review positively in order to get more visibility.

[Dsiclaimer: I used to love this game and I spent £90 because I thought I was supporting good developers, still do not regret these purchases but i wouldn't do it again, especially in the game's current state]  


Honestly, its a goddamn terrible game but fun as hell once you get going w/ friends. 

I have played since the frst year of early access. I have every single weapon, vehicle and character from the US army, a tanker from the Germans and an infantry w/ a ppsh-41 from the Russians. The only reason i kept playing the game is because, as i was getting better along with the rest of the community (which is very connected on forums but seemingly ingnored by the devs), we were growing together. 

Now, the game has a reworked progression system that make zero sense, no actual ingame money gain because there is the 'repair' system on in-game items, which actively discourages you to mod you guns to your needs (and also makes recons reduntant as you have to mod your rifle to the teeth with mods to make them OHK (which is the only reason to play as a recon). 

Overall, the game is an unbalanced, deserted, and hacker filled mess.
Riperonni to my most played game. 
Oh well.
I started playing a week or so ago and LOVED this game.  The ability to actually hide in bushes, no big name tags over enemy heads giving away the hiding spot, camo working the way it does in real life, making you hard to see.  The leveling system WAS pretty cool ranking up ribbons and gaining levels to unlock new class like tanker and paratrooper all the way to general. And of course the persistent war that was run by players at officer level allocating resources and assault teams to be fought out by the players.  I liked the no third person view in a tank but being forced to see through the vision slit, or pop your head out of the turret hatch for a better look and pray nobody popped ya...

The game gave way, WAY more xp for capturing and holding control points rather then kills and the plenty of  ribbon upgrades (that unlock all the vehicles, weapon mods, and special traits) that were not tied directly to combat would gain xp by you doing smart things in the game, like moving slowly, crouching, picking up teamates in transport vehicles, sprinting etc...It was a nice blend of realism and fun with plenty to do.  The grind was pretty steep, but it did not bother me to badly, I was unlocking things at a nice pace and was enjoying the game so much I paid money to unlock the Tiger I and bought a 30 day "premium" account. 

Then they destroyed it.  Unannounced and buried in the patch notes as "Ribbon drivers adjusted" and mentioned NO WHERE else was  a 75% NERF to ALL XP GAINS!!!  The game was already a steep grind, now, its damn near pointless to play.  There are about 35 ribbons, all of which unlock things in game, and the estimate given by the developer was "200 hours of game to max out ONE stinking ribbon..."  also, ribbons are not shared between your characters, so your tanker, your pilot , your para-trooper have to grind them all individually....Not to mentions there are three nations and nothing gets transferred between those either...

I've never felt so spit upon by a developer before, seriously, I've never cared to write a review before, but folks, I gotta tell ya the sad truth, this is a  game with a ton of potential, and some unique and fun qualities, but I would NOT recommend starting the game as new player now, you are gonna face nothing but players with almost/all unlocks already completed and you will be in for a grind of, literally, THOUSANDS of hours before you are even competative.  Which means you won't have any fun playing the games biggest draw the "war" until then as well...

Go play world of tanks, war thunder or red orchestra 2 instead....what a shame...
I decided to change my review for this game after the Timoshenko update. 

I have been playing this game for quite a long time now, and it seemed to have just reached the point where it was getting fun and my skills and practice were paying off.

That was, until the Timoshenko update this week.

I thought "Oh wow, Soviet teams! That will be awesome!" I started playing a map and suddenly these brand new Soviet characters were charging down the field like an unstoppable beast, capturing all of the points and one-shotting all of my teammates. Map after map, it was the brand new Soviet characters winning.

If they were just added to the game, how are they outperforming players that have been playing for a year?!?!

The answer is that the newest update has really leveraged the pay to win, and most of the soviet teams' characters were bought with real money as an "Academy - Trained Character." Academy trained is basically a cheat code to bypass INSANE amounts of play time. I didn't mind the veteran accounts and the booster ribbons for boosting XP. Sure, that's p2w too, but this new advantage for payers is just ridiculous. It's not even fun to play anymore.

I'm not one of those anti-profit people, but there is a balance. The devs essentially are pushing away a huge portion of their fan base that has been playing for a long time because now they're getting their butts kicked by noobs with a credit card.

I gave this game my enthusastic recommendation and time, but now I'm going back to change it. Pay to win was always there to some degree, but now it's at the level where the game is ruined. It's too bad because they made a great game at first. What a shame.
After spending $40.00 having 3 months of veteran status that I just bought. One of the Mod's banned me. No reason given. (As there policy is they don't have to tell you why they banned you) Maybe he was butt hurt that I killed him a couple times? The mod's seem to be kids and you get one mad = Ban. So I was basically robbed of $40.00 and about 4 months of rank. While I enjoyed the game play the mod's really suck. I have never been banned from a game in 13 years of game playing. Ever! I don't cheat, I don't hack. My K/D sucks. But I still try my best. I will never give this company a dime more.
Played this about a half a year to a year ago. I had great fun. Until the support team completely fucked up my experience with this game. I had a friend who had a great round one time. More than 90 kills with a fully upgraded Kar98 and say, 3-5 deaths. At that time the upgrades were pretty OP and the Kar98 was able to drop someone one shot from about 200+m away. Low and behold the server started whining and complaining about him being a hacker. When Me, my friend who got banned, and my whole group knew about this buffed AF Kar98. Somehow the support team heard about it and completely permabanned him. COMPLETELY. With absolutely no evidence other than a few screenshots of the leaderboard and the word of a few whiny babies. Through plenty of effort to try and get the ban lifted it was met with nothing but threats of bans and wipes of our accounts. We WERE all veteran players until this happened. We said fuck you and completely abandoned this game. The devs only care about the moolah. They just stole our money and kicked us to the curb. Shows how much these guys really care about their community. You can really tell a lot about a company by the way the treat their players.
About time for me to give my thoughts. This game is not worth anything anymore. When it was first coming out, it had a LOT of potential. But now, it's a mess.

To shorten the long paragraph I was about to write, the devs have decided the community doesn't matter. All the most recent updates (as from over a year ago) have been changing things that have no relation to what people want, or adding in "filler" content which servers no legit purpose inside the game. The community has been on the backburner, and there have been no advances in changing this. It is only a matter of time before the fires get too high and the game burns to the ground.
WARNING! GAME RUN BY EXTREMELY FRAUDALENT & SCUMMY & TOXIC DEVELOPERS!

------------------------------------------------------

Some small part of me as a previous fanboy of this game wished that all of the current controversy and bad rumors that's currently going around this game and the company behind it wasn't true. The most prominent eye-opener for me in this case was when I found out that the developers are shrugging at the people dedicating themselves to extensively griefing people and pushing them under the rug category as "minor trolls" without taking any action: http://imgur.com/a/s4uuA and permanently banning people on the forums for trying to blow the whistle on this fact: http://i.imgur.com/H2M1KPq.jpg (See http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097940740/recommended/227940/)

Yes, that's right. Someone posting in the FORUMS and leaving a NEGATIVE game review got his IN-GAME account PERMANENTLY BANNED without actually doing anything against the ToS IN THE GAME ITSELF.

I did some further digging and oh boy do these guys commit themselves to doing some shady cràp, especially in the topic of the buy-able ingame currency known as gold. I've asked a few friends about it too and almost everyone who bought gold (or thought about it) has seen the prices for them constantly change and swap around, after not long, I came across this image: http://i.imgur.com/yut1Wkj.jpg

Which I traced back to this Reddit thread that has tons of people all being the victim (and observers) of the same thing, Reto-Moto changing and swapping the prices around, paying little to no heed as to just what country you are in unless the currency is worth more along with the prices themselves changing without notice: https://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesandGenerals/comments/3k8bnz/hg_gold_prices_same_country_different_account_wtf/

"Huh". I said to myself as I browsed through the thread and recently thought back to the one customer support I've had with them: http://imgur.com/3jahD4Z

-------------------------------------------------------

I brushed it off at the time but now I'm starting to get some understanding for all the overhanging greedy & shady cràp that's going on in this company and most of it seems to come right back to this "Gargamel" character, a neckbearded fellow (whom i can only describe as a manchild that goes by the name "Fred" from his biography described boners of playing nothing but retro games, listening to electro music and cosplaying WWII) that has the official job title of being a "Community assistant". The few Steam forum posts I've seen him make can only help me draw the conclusion that he is an extremely toxic, arrogant and sadistic individual that is doing his very best to shìtsmear, indiscriminatively perma-ban and push anyone off the rails who is even marginally thinking about giving the company he works for and/or their game Heroes & Generals some form of criticism or negative feedback, one way or another: http://imgur.com/MQ0itdm

He also has a view that can only be seen as over-zealous when It comes to their anticheat system where he has essentially taken the stance of it being 100% fool-proof with no false positives even being in the realms of a tangible possibility: http://imgur.com/9HCKOjr

But the most shocking point for me was how much of a small portion of the community knew what was going on as I kept finding more and more proof of just what kind of ship they were running: http://imgur.com/AVHxx1j

Eventually, I came across this wordpress page: https://amonsul1155.wordpress.com/2015/03/23/hello-world/

And holy cràp. There was the last shiny golden nail of evidence going into the box for me to finally be convinced. Namely, this image: http://imgur.com/SBoUUXe

That's right, guys. Your freedom of speech, AKA your most basic civil right as a human being has through blood pacts with the devil company known as Reto-Moto been made conditional. By playing the game, you have given up your soul, your voice and your free will. Have a nice day.

-------------------------------------------------------

:::TL;DR::: http://imgur.com/SBoUUXe & http://imgur.com/MQ0itdm :::TL;DR:::

-------------------------------------------------------

Now let it be officially known that anyone who criticizes this game or gives it some other form of tangible negatively shaped feedback in any way, shape or form is a "Troll" and shall be called as such while their privileges to play a game they paid for shall be taken away.

---------------------------------

P.S: This game is factually a Pay-2-Win title 

(Definition can be found and read here: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=pay-to-win and here: http://imgur.com/kNsAOA8 )

By having one out of two Combat Badge slot (A system that gives your character some pretty fat big passive bonuses such as taking 15% less damage, reloading twice as fast or sprinting twice as long) be locked behind a premium subscription: http://imgur.com/xd4YFg1

Your game has serious, glaring faults, Reto-Moto & "Gargamel". Get over it. Or alternatively, spend 15% of the time and effort you do on censorshipping and scamming people out of money to repairing your broken garbage product and you might actually get something fixed in the near future to stop the ongoing pitfall of players your shìtty game is facing: http://imgur.com/xOaQHww
The most frustrating gaming experience of my life. Huge potential, but the same game breaking flaws that has been addressed for years is just not a priority for the developers. I have an literal army of stuff in the game, both the action and RTS part, but the year old maps absolutely kills the game for me now. They should have been updated/replaced regularly, continuously ever since beta.. It was just never a priority for the devs.. It should hav been from the start..
Gameplay wise, the war mode is the only mode that appeal to me as a veteran of the game. But the nonexistent class management means that even though the game is infantry centered and the battles are fought, lost and won over checkpoints that need to held - by infantry. You will most likely have to fight this battle on a 20 man team consisting of a random amount of pilots and recons and tankers and with no regard to the fact the game need some proportion with infantry numbers in each match to actually work.  

Top that with the fact that super veterans clans and über noobs with more than a couple of hours are put in the same matchmaking group and you have a perfectly broken game. 

+ 1000 other small, annoying, obvius, stupid flaws. Including ridiculous waiting times, and irrationel and unrealistic conefire and recoil bullet trajectory..  and a horrible spawning system.



I have LOTS of hours in this game and it had HUGE potential. I play 2 factions, German and US. I took a break for 1 1/2 years and then decided to try it again, but now after almost 2 months, I again reached the point where I lost most of the fun in it. I usually don't write reviews, unless the game is really really good, or I really get extremely frustrated by something.

HEADSHOTS: One of the main reason I won't play this much anymore. The developer obviously thinks that noobs   (money cows) will stay longer if they get a decent amount of lucky headshots when spraying their weapons. 7 out of 10 deaths for me are now instant headshots. And no, not while I'm standing still. Often the barrel of the weapon is not even pointed at me. I for myself make almost no headshots and most good players also don't, because it's stupid to go for headshot against good players if you have some skill - it's much safer to go for torso. So obvioulsy there is a huge bias towards noobs just to make them happy. But it spoils the game completely for me, because your skill doesn't matter in these situations at all, it's just free trophies for noobs. it's REALLY frustrating. And I am sure the game stats are faked regarding this, how can I die 7 out of 10 times through headshot but the statistic tells me there are only a handful of headshots in the match? Or maybe you get headshotted more often the better you are(?) So think about if you really want to get good in this game, because the day will come that all of these insane amounts of grinding for new weapons and credits will turn out to have been just to realize you get headshotted by noobs all the time.

CHEATERS: Despite the introduction of battle eye, some matches are just full of them. Just google for "Heroes and Generals Hacks" and you see all the xxxx there is. Aim bots, Wall Hacks, Soldier Highlighting etc. etc. Many of them in Russian language. I even get shot through rocks and walls sometimes. A few days ago, I got even shot by a sniper 2 times (not 1 miss) while in spawn protection, where you are supposed to be invisible until you leave the spawn area. Also quite often, I am running in some random bushline or forest and the planes pick me up with sniper precision (you should know that it's basically impossible to see infantry running in bushes or forests from planes, unless you have a software aid of course) And no, I was not coming out of spawn, nor was I just leaving an open field or something where they could have spotted me before.

GRAPHICS: If this was the year 2010 or earlier, maybe I would say it's alright (DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE PICTURES AND VIDEOS THEY SHOW HERE, THE GAME LOOKS NOTHING...N-O-T-H-I-N-G...LIKE THIS). Despite these bad graphics, the game is SO stuttery. I usually don't have lags like many others (only on some days) BUT the movement is just not smooth at all. Compare this to Counter Strike where moving, turning etc. is just extremely smooth and enjoyable. In HnG it feels like the movement is made of thousands of tiny micro stutters. Yea it's playable but just not really enjoyable. And let's not talk about the constant game crashes when trying to join a match.

DEVELOPER: Gives ZERO damn about what the community thinks - I mean ZERO. You can hardly ever see a comment of them in the forums. And if they do, it's usually to close the thread. They have a Video Q&A sometimes on twitch but those questions are obviously pre-filtered because there, nobody asks the really important things. It's just chit chat question for the CEO (who says himself he hardly ever plays the game because he has little time - well shouldn't you know about the game if you are the CEO of it???).

WEAPONS BALANCE: Ridiculous. Some weapons are completely OP and many weapons you can't see xxxx because of all the cone fire and smoke when shooting. Just spray and pray.

TANK, PLANE and SNIPER SPAMMING: Some battles are almost impossible to play at all. You run or drive a few meters, you are dead. Respawn and repeat, until you simply quit or run out of resources. -100 fun factor.

GRINDING OR PAYING: The amount you have to play in this game to buy stuff is insane. An extreme example is the Green Peas Camo for your German soldier, which costs 790,000 credits or 4,100 Gold. Even with my super soldier with the highest salary, that would take me about 50-70 hours of pure combat to reach this (only while fighting inside a batlle earns you credits). Because of the little pay and high repair costs. Or you pay money of course, it's just below EUR 20 for that 1 piece of camo. What a bargain!! 

UPDATES: Once in a blue moon. Compare this to games like Rust where there are very big updates every month even. Here you have a minor, update maybe 2-3 times a year.

I wish the devs of Day of Infamy/Insurgency (New World Interactive) would make a Heroes & Generals Clone with very similar gameplay but done well instead of this mess that HnG is. I am sure they could do this 1000x better than Reto.
You know that guy who slaughters all the noobs with highly advanced weaponry that makes everything feel unbalanced? I'm that guy. I was the dude who looked up all the stats for every gun, knows the armor thickness and speed of every tank in the game, and consistantly topped the leaderboard. I played for a while, not as long as some, much longer than others. And I had a lot of fun. I paid about $15 once because I figured all the problems in this game could be fixed if I helped out a little bit, but all the rest of it, the OHK sniper rifle, my super high level American, I got that all through grinding. And it wasn't even a grind sometimes, I had fun.

But I can't recommend this game. If you don't already have at least my amount of time in this game, you're done. It used to be that you started with one soldier from each faction and had grenades to go with your starting weapon. You had something to get you up on your feet. Not any more. I've seen the expenses of every item go up nearly double. It went from being bordering on unreasonable to almost insane. But I already had the good gear on one of my characters, so I kept playing. Firing thirty bullets from my rifle cut into half my earnings and other equipment brought me near to breaking even. So I had to nerf my own character to continue playing, and I couldn't go back to my nub characters without being so badly killed I didn't have fun. "Git gud" doesn't apply here. I've been on the other end of the slaughter. There is nothing a new player to stand against someone with better equipment except take pot shots at a distance and hope to scrap together some XP, which isn't fun. And if a game isn't fun, its not worth playing.

The real nail in the coffin is the technical issues. It got so bad that I couldn't stay in a match for more than a minute before the entire game went bonkers. After a couple days of this, I just stopped trying. It really isn't worth the trouble.

TL;DR
It was fun, now its not because grind/technical issues/not new player friendly. Give it a shot if you want, could be your cup of tea, wasn't mine. This is an opinion, just like every review. Treat it as such when you are making your decision, and bear in mind its free-to-play, so there's no harm in trying it yourself.

UPDATE: 16MAY18

Over one year since the original review. Nothing much has changed, now they've added Battleye to prevent cheating. I've never witnessed any cheating (not saying it isn't there), and Battleye seems offensively intrusive. You have to have it to play. If you are fine subjecting your computer to that to ensure fair play on a game, go for it. Cracking down on cheating is fine, maybe a year from now they'll get around to improving the core gameplay. 'Free' is still an excellent price if you like the grind.

TLDR; Nothing new, added Battleye. Because of this, my dislike for this game is becoming a bit less passive.
With over 600 hours of game play here is what I have to say about the game. It had the potential to be one of the best FPS games of all time. It's not pay to win by no means. All players have access to all weapons and vehichles in the game. Spending money will just reduce the time it takes to aquire these weapons and vehicles. I aquired almost all the vehicles and weapons in less than 300 hours of game play. Why do I not play anymore? Because Reto is the empitome of incompetence. They have severe networking issues. Vehicle balance is anything but balanced. Customer support is horrendous. The RTS side of the game is the worst RTS I have ever seen. Advice to Reto: Sell the game to a real gaming company.
How does this game feel?

Look at my profile picture. You're playing the game but you hate every second of it. 

From getting weapons and the horrible micro transactions to having to three shot someone in the chest with an M1 Garand to kill them, but you keep playing because in no other game can you blow sixty commies on a car with the 88 mm organ on your Tiger I. 

It's basically that phsyco ex you keep going back to, you shouldn't had gotten with her in the first place.
I remember that time when all the veteran players joined a few devs for a FAQ session and they told us that "Catering to old players won't get us money to make new content since they've already invested into the game." We simply got told that since they already had our money, there's no point fixing end game content for us. That was one of the largest exodus of players I ever seen in a game that was not shutting down. I doubt a rebranding will change how people who know what reto moto is capable of think of this game. Generals are needed to deploy assault teams in war so players can spawn into battles. That is the main selling point of this game. If they tell their generals to f off, there's no one creating content for war mode. What's the point of this game then? There's better FPS only WW2 shooters out there. You can't claim to be a FPS/RTS game when you neglect the RTS aspect of the game.
UPDATE: this has became an unplayable piece of shit, dont bother to download


Dev managed to completely ruin this game with the latest update. Both fps and strategy side is poinless to play with the time consuming and annoying restrictions in strategy part and turning it to a grindfest fps wise.

The idea was promising, the combination of rts and fps is unique, the attitude and greed of the devs is unbreable. Do not waste any time with the recent build, wait for the rollback or forget it.
when i first started playing back in September 2014 it was really FUN
but then developers became greedy


1. buying soldier costs 6X more
2. Salary Decreased, if you just started playing don't use too much mods on guns, don't spam with nades (applies to SU players) or repair bill will be higher then credits tried to gain 
3. no more transfer between classes, so, to buy for e. new recon (every new players w*t dream) you have to grind for 540 K credit (and it comes without scope XD) 

yes you can unlock every gun in game without paying cent but grind is hell in this game

the only reason people still play this game is RTS is linked to FPS and it is also broken

still planning to stay in this game and play War matches? 

here few tips:
want to have no skill  Weapon & OP Armor but stupid teammates? go for US

want to have bunch of resource go for SU

want to experience struggle and pain go for GE XD 

because Germany is overpopulated 
and by reto logic one way to balance game is nerf faction with guns and resources

hitreg is joke in this game

game is full of bug (some of them are from 2014)

instead of fixing them they are  adding more content which is not privilege
devs are too slow fixing them and only excuses is : "we are small team of dev" 

developers might act like they listen community but no, they do what they want and funny thing is that there is no understanding of change log, weapon prices and specification may change you will never notice. 

and few word about MAPS
there is only 9 map in game 
during 5 YEAR of game development there is only 9 maps..
 

there is so many details in game which i cant remember

in one word: Game is dying.
Honestly? This game was a great concept. It WAS great, too, until the devs screwed with it too much.
I hadn't played since sometime last year, and back then it was relatively easy (in comparison to now) to grind out enough XP over a few days of dedicated playing to buy a tank or a weapon.

Now? Jesus.

The devs have made this game entirely pay-to-win, and it's damned near impossible to buy new gear. You get just enough cash to scrape by and repair your equipment. It would take weeks and weeks to achieve what I had been able to achieve in a few days a year ago. The people who pay real money (which I cannot) are speeding around with shiny top of the line tanks and amazing firearms while I'm still rooting around in the dirt with an m1 Garand. It's painfully obvious that the devs only care about one thing; money. Not community, not ease of access, nothing except the cash rolling in from people that can afford to buy things.

My advice to the devs (if they even look at the steam reviews- there's hundreds of more like mine) is either decrease weapon maintenance or multiply the XP players recieve. Or, y'know, make the game entirely play-to-win.

TL:DR the devs are money-hungry bastards that don't make the game user friendly at all. 2/10.
Used to be a Good game, Back in 2014 and 2015 but since then it has gone downhill

Devs keep adding things that the game doesn't need and ignore the things that need attention

The game is insanely grind filled and has gotten more and more so RETO can milk more and more cash via Premium in game currency

The classes are extremely expensive to use and even more expensive to get into

The Hit Reg is one of the worst I've seen in a game

The Movements clunky and driving is unresponsive

The Game runs awefully especially in wooded areas (Which the devs keep adding)

Spawn camping can be a major issue

It runs through a terrible and annoying Launcher that the game goes to between matches (Much like Battlefield 4)

You begin with a Semi Automatic Rifle that takes 3x Chest shots to kill whereas other more veteran players may have OHK Sniper rifles and the Russian PTRD can OHK a car or Bike with the correct upgrades....You have to spend hours grinding the SA Rifle just to get it to 2x shot if you're lucky

The Americans get the Chaffee light tank which takes 5x shots from enemies to kill but kills others in 3 with a similar reload rate

you cannot leave the objectives OR go anywhere for fear of getting constantly sniped

The community is filled with FanBoys who would rather try and ignore or bombast any who critisize their precious Heroes and Generals

Weapons are added that are completely over powered and do not get nerfed for months

Overall I can say that I've had some great times in this game but it's going down hill fast and dying, Play if you want, What do I care?
I had read the reviews of this game before I installed and prepared for the worse. But at first it didn't seems to bad the immersion was excellent and I enjoyed hitching rides on player's jeeps to the front line where I would hold the building against the other team (that part I enjoyed most) The best part was the P2W aspect wasn't bothering me too much. Sure the fact we had to buy our own ammo let alone weapons was annoying (not really accurate). But it wasn't to bad at the moment I was actually thinking of giving a positive reveiw on this maybe even an 9/10.

Then I reached level 3.

I tried out the new modes that were unlocked for me and I was thrown into an unbalanced, annoying, unfun game of who-paid-the-most. Crushed by tanks, head shotted from superb snipers. Sprayed by suprieor weapons. I couldn't defend myself since what good is a MP34 against a one-shotting Soviet Anti-Tank Rifle? (also I'm pretty sure that useing such a weapon against infantry is banned by the Geneva convention) I just simply wasn't ready for the shitstorm of advanced players after level 3. What is also annoying AF is the lack of communication abilties among your teamates. If i've cornered by 5 guys and need to request help. There is no time to press t and type *need help at X2* because they would've sprayed you by then. Since there is no voice chat in the game. Another complait I have is the combat in general, it feels clunky slightly better than DayZ, but still clunky.

Then there is the biggest complaint of all from not just me, but from multiple people! The god-awful, rage-inducing, hair-pulling, life shortening, Pay 2 Win system. It's simple, if you don't pay, you gotta grind for hours upon hours just for a new gun! In the amount of time I played, I still just have a MP34. And whats even worse is when your creamed by some guy with the best weapons in the game who just forked over some cash.

This is why this game cannot be reccomended at all to the great people of steam. I would give it a 1/10 thanks to the semi-helpful community. But I give a 9/10 to the game before you reach level 3.

(another thing that will truely piss you off is the number of people *especially when playing the soviet faction* who people use anti-tank weapons against infantry *a certain one-hit kill*)

Another thing I think this game could have is a humans VS bots system, I can't be the only one who likes a little practise system when PvP gets to be too much. It would certainly keep me coming back. I know it's possible because of the tutorial segment of the game. I can't be the only one who likes to destroy bots every now and then

*edit* The new update from what I can tell, makes the P2W even worse, now you can pay to level up your ribbions!

*more edit* now you cannot deny that is it P2W since now the devs have raised the price of everything again! the weapons are crazy expensive, the mp40 is now over 100,000 credits, the kar 98 is no better, 89,000 credits. even the shitty mp34 is 45,000 credits! really?

*even more edit* As suggested by D3uterzx, the main reason why each game is who-has-the-most-tanks, is because the weapons required for infantry to get rid of them is extremly expensive with some poor souls racking up thousands in costs and making it worth it more to simply leave the game and wait for it to end.

XYLANDER UPDATE:

I came back to the game after I saw that A new update came out. I check out all of it's new features and frankly, all the previous issues were still there. However, I must say that for some reason, the war games i played were much more fun than when I played on staged servers. Possibly because EVERY match wasn't spawncamped by tanks (because there weren't tanks or not that many. And for the first time since lvl 3, I actually had fun in war mode. The 50% more XP was also a bonus.

But an issue that came with war are the long queue times. Never in my life have i waited HALF AN HOUR to get into a game. Only for it to be almost over. It just needs to be fixed

The new credit system, make more as you play sounds good, got me interested. Maybe its becasue im only rank 6, but I'm still making around 5,000-6,000 a match. So, no differece there.

The battle Director, that seemed like the next best thing since sliced bread. Reto is probaly gonna tweak it anyway. But for me i got matches with respawns such as 200 my team v 5,000 spawns on other team. great idea though.

Basicly, as of now, same game as last time. 

PS can RETO please do something about the OHK rifles everyones running around with? It's just annoying
1. I hate that each update dumbs the game down to nothing more than a 'Red Vs. Blue' shoot 'em up that even the most mindless of FPS player would find too simple.

2. I hate that the devs cater to people who complain en mass over something they don't like (getting sniped) and implement something totally stupid to counter it (tracer rounds that can be seen clearly even in the day time)

3. I hate that good suggestions (medics, better flight models, proper tank physics, realistic damage to tank tracks, plane cockpit view, different uniforms as you go up in rank, deployable bipods, tank cupola view and so on) have been seemingly neglected.

4. I hate that rather than fix something or make it the best they can (e.g. Tanks) the devs just introduce more of said broken item.

5. I hate that after 3 years+ of development we still have one campaign, guns sound like they are firing paintballs, tanks flip when running into bicycles and come to a complete stop when hitting a simple wooden fence and much more.

6. I hate that maps are so big and empty with no ambiance, no destruction and nothing that makes me remotely think I'm in a war.

7. I hate the new weight system and how totally absurd it is (a grease gun weighing as much as a Thompson, a scoped Kar 98 weighing less than a regular Kar 98)

8. I hate that it took them so long to bring back paratroopers, and have essentially made them useless by giving them only 6 equipment slots, barely enough to equip anything. Even though paratroopers in WW2 were fitter and carried almost triple the equipment of a regular soldier.

9. I hate that the FG42 is listed as an LMG and has the same weight as an MG42 when it is comparable in size and weight to a modern assault rifle.

10. I hate that veteran has been essentially shoved down our throats by removing a weapon and badge slot, even though they have other ways of gaining income (especially a $99 pack on steam unlocking everything).

11. I hate that the devs seem to have no clear direction and won't admit it, even though we can all see it.

12. I hate that Team killers and griefers are not getting banned. People are getting random banned.
http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960868745/recommended/227940/

13. I hate that when I fielded my assault team and they got routed, I got database connection error.
Basically I have to stay away from the general tab to play the fps game. What a joke.

14. Most of all, I hate that the devs don't see that they are essentially running their own game into the ground by not respecting the community, or heeding their feedback. Long time players are leaving in droves because of it and how each update brings the game further away from what they hoped it would be. Short time players (who they are now catering too) will eventually leave after they've wallet warriored their way to boredom and see that the game is essentially in a stalemate.


-Quoted from their official forum-
After being away from playing H&G for about 3 weeks I logged in to find my account had been banned because of "cheating/hacking". I am an older gamer (50), and have seen the internet from the beginning. I have played many online games in my day and NEVER have I cheated at nor attempted to learn a hack in my life. After submitting a ticket and explaining to RETO about this thier reply was basically tough luck and refuse to even discuss the matter with me. I spent a small amount fo real $ on this game and actually enjoyed it. But after this rip-off and disrespect to me I will take every chance to defam this pices of junk game as well as to speak down to the staff that has any hand in this game. If this is the way paying customers are treated, you would be a fool to have any part of it.
As of the new update (7/7/2015) I can no longer recommend this game in good conscious. It has officially taken a "pay to win" route, in the fact that all guns, and their modifications can now be purchased with real money as opposed to having to play to earn them. 

In the past, you could pay real money to get "boosters" to help speed Ribbon progression along, which unlocked guns and weapon modifcations; but you still had to play, and it was only a 50% boost in XP. There was also "veteran" time available. 

As of this new update, you can literally complete your Ribbon levels ( thus unlocking both weapons and modifications) by paying real money without having ever played a match.

"But we can use silver!" 

Yes. we can, and this is great for those of us who have been playing for a year or more, and have literally a Million Silver credits or more stacked up from previous earning rates in different builds.

 However, newer players, or even players that have 100 hours in the game, won't be able to take advantage of this. Maintenance costs, weapon prices, ammo prices, and current credit earnings make all of this non feasible for a large portion of the community whom is just starting off. This gives a very small portion of the community (and those to whom money is no object) a clear advantage in skipping progression.

Thats just going too far for me. I really enjoyed this game for quite awhile, but that is the final straw. I cannot recommend something which operates on this basis.

The in-game economy needs to be fixed.
At first i would like to say i used to play this game before it was available on Steam. I've spent over 100+ hours in this game.
It started as a cool concept but unfortunately it turned out to be bad. First of all I really wanted this game to be good (and in some cases it is) i love concept of WW2 FPS. 
Unfortunately there are tons of problems! 
Game is clearly pay to win. The amount of money you earn after a battle is so little it barely is enough for fixing and ammmunition. So in the end it's incredible grind fest to get a single weapon in this game (prizes of weapons are ridicolous).
Secondly the level progress is also painfully slow. Recently they changed lvl exp caps and it's almost impossible for newbies to reach high levels (beside no-lifing or paying ofc) 
Moreover there is another problem!!! So you work your way to the 9th lvl or so and want to become sniper (all in all you were one-shoted so many times by high lvl, full gear players so you want revange) so you pay for becoming sniper AND THAN you have to buy a SNIPER RIFLE for like 150k ingame money. What THE FUCK is that. You paid to be a sniper and you have to additionally buy a sniper rifle in order to play it!?!?!? and 150k is a loooot of money if you don't wnat to pay real money.

AND the balance of the game... even in staged battles which were supposed to be well "staged" and equal to every side. You end up being slaughtered buy 5 tanks when there is no tank-driver player in your squad!!! or you're constantly bombed by pilots cuz there is nobody to take it down.

Lastly... optimalization is a joke. My PC can easily run BF4 on high with decent fps ( close to 60). Not this game. And I'm pretty sure it looks way worse and mechanics are simpler...

ALL IN ALL there are some positives. Some matches are fun, When teams are balanced it's a satisfactory game. But there are just waay to many bugs, P2W mechanics and bad optimalization. 

Just don't waste your time!!!
Having over 700 hours of playing Heroes and Generals since during beta, the game is just getting more and more worse. It really makes me sad to see that this game had a lot of potential but the developers are ruining it. They ruin the game by: 
1.  Do whatever they want on their game since it is free 2 play, however this causes and issue because they just raise the price on classes you want to try, weapons, vehicles which is not fun since grinding takes a long time and requires a lot of patiences. However this will ruin the new players first impression of this game.
2.  The developers just ignore their players including the veterans players. I've seen countless players reporting bugs and issues they're facing in game like being able to go through walls that was no barriers, or hit registration is not well done. I've even seen few veterans players filing reports on the discussions on what issue the game is having such as new players being constantly destroyed by veteran players, some suggested rank battles so then the new players won't have such issues or having bad experience in matches since they're going against players that have same experience as them. However all of this are being ignored by the devs, instead they focus on new contents hoping to bring new players.
3.  The Devs are a bit ignorant. I am not saying this because I hate the devs but I've seen their videos and they barely fix a lot of things in game. Yes there were some fixes they did that made me happy. However they just post videos that nobody asked like the deep dive. Not just that I feel the devs sort of abuse their power since they are free to play and the only ww2 game so far at the moment to have both air and land forces combines together with the infantry.
4.  The weapons...God please no...the weapons...it is just that some weapons are just really unbalanced very few weapons that feel balanced are the thompson and the mp40, and some other few weapons but many weapons I just feel that are just unbalance some weapons are overpowered and some weapons are underpowered and some weapons shouldn't be getting the same stats like the m1a1/m1 carbine having the same stats as the m2 carbine.
5.  The servers are just plain sh*t the developers don't realise how important it is to add more servers around the world. I see countless players lagging or teleporting to another location due to very bad pings and packet loss. Usually when it comes to muliplayers the devs understand the importants of adding more servers so then players will have easier time with the ping instead of..I don't know...SMASHING THEIR DAMN TABLE BECAUSE OF THE PING AND PACKET DIFFICULT FOR PLAYERS TO EVEN PLAY THE DAMN GAME!!!

I know I will be getting a lot of hate from players, but don't get the wrong idea that I hate this game. I loved this game a lot, I played it with passion and sometime rage, but it is just that with more and more issues that are popping up on Heroes and Generals recently just makes me wanna stop playing, but I don't wanna stop playing because it is fun sometime but at the same time I don't want to because it is not fun. When I see that I am going against new players it just makes me feel bad sometime because I am ruining their experience on this game, and also fustrating sometime going against players spamming vehicles like the yak, luch, hellcats, panthers, tigers, p38 and other vehicles and weapons.



So to those who have patience (LOTS OF PATIENCE) go ahead give it a try. 
To those who wants to have some fun time and thinking about trying new weapons in a short period of time...Don't because this game takes a long time to grind and can be very VERY fustrating and upsetting.
Don't even bother. Slow development, 0 priorities, almost no communication between devs and players, unbalanced, it takes hundreds of hours to grind for stuff that you want, almost no maps = if you play war don't expect anything else than 3 maps again and again, devs ban on forums for giving criticism, devs ban on discussions for criticism of their banning, devs ban in game when they get their ass kicked by players who actually play the game and are much better than them.

Director of reto should be fired. Milking only handful of players for money can't be profitable, but why fix our game, bring more players and increase our income, am I right?

EDIT 27.9.2017 - Devs decided to make several steps towards the community and became much more open and active on forum, discussions and twitch. I'm not gonna change my review because so far nothing has changed, but if they continue in this direction I'll be sure to change my review.

EDIT 7.10.2018 - After a year nothing but broken armor system happened. Don't bother with this game.
I play this a lot. And I hate it. Weird huh? Well, despite it's shortcomings it's one of the few games out there that have all the components I'm looking for. But it's underdeveloped and the devs have some very weird priotities. Like getting different helmet camouflages before fixing the very basic and stupid tank damage model for instance. It's pay-to-win, unless you want to grind your ass off. As soon as something more intelligent shows up, I'm out, and I'm guessing that goes for a lot of the players.
Short Answer: Terrible Game. 

Long Answer: I've played Heroes and Generals for a very long time, and I have been frustrated almost every moment of it. The game is incredibly grindy and the grind has only been made harder over the years, for instance the price to buy a new class of soldier has doubled, Everything in the game has upkeep to pay everytime you use it and using high teir equipment can even lead to a match where equipment expenses far outweighs the earnings from the match. The game is very much pay to win as a person that pays for a membership gets 2 "badge" slots rather than 1 (the badges give powerful buffs like 15% damage reduction, 25% better hip fire, and no kill cam, among many others). Many balance issues exist in game that the devs blatantly ignore, such as Russia having the only AT gun in the entire game (and the only teir 3 submachine gun), the U.S having by far the worst aircraft for the longest time.

Development has stagnated for a very long time, while there are updates containing small features like new vehicles, many highly anticipated features have been missing for years. The last new map was added 2 years ago back in 2015 (with the exclusion of a tiny map focused around one small building). this is worsened by the fact that the game only has 5 full sized maps and 4 small ones. The player cap in a match is 18vs18 and despite years of the dev's promising higher counts nothing has changed. Recent updates THIS YEAR have brought such features as: Tutorials for beginners, Medics, and Water Physics. All features that most FPS hold as core mechanics that are now just being added. More concerningly is the multiple sound, graphics, and lighting overhauls. The game overshot its lifespan before it was even released. 

I only played this game because I was in highschool and could not afford actually finished games, too bad the only good thing about this game is that its free.
TL;dr --- played game for 1000+ hours (since back when game was browser based as well as on Steam) and my honest opinion is: NOT RECOMMENDED.

---------------------------------

Started playing this game years ago. Back then it was still fairly raw and a game in development.

I really enjoyed the combined arms aspect of this game where it combined air force, infantry and armor on the same map. In a sense it was a nice flashback to Battlefield 1942.

I've since played it fairly regularly now over the years and seen many of the updates that have been rolled out. New weapons, new vehicles and new toys as well as a couple new maps (3 to be precise, so one per year since I started roughly) and revamp of existing maps as well.

However, despite the new toys being added there are numerous issues that have prevailed for, literally, years without being resolved. Some things get resolved while other times things are added to the game, very quickly identified by the community as flawed and yet it takes the developer months upon months without reacting. In fact, despite the issues being highlighted, discussed, suggestions and ideas thrown around by the community, the developer remains disturbingly quiet. An example of this is the Soviet PTRD which was capable of one-shotting jeeps full of players from long ranges, as well as capable of shooting down aircraft. It was a one-man army tool for oneshotting jeeps, infantry and 3-shotting airplanes.

Has it been fixed now? Their solution was to make it less accurate by adding RNG sway and larger cone of fire / dispersion pattern for the weapon, thus removing any control the player has over where the bullet will actually go. Fixed? Or just further broken? Still widely discussed, and not a word from developer.

The longer you play this game the more and more of these issues you become aware of. And when you start to investigate by looking at Reddit, in the Steam discussions or their official forums one thing quickly becomes clear. The community is passionate and eager for the game to succeed. There are hours and hours of feedback and suggestions, and by that I mean constructive feedback and suggestions and not just childish "other team has OP stuff, plz nerf". People invested enourmous amounts of effort into this.

However.. it all disappears into a black hole and the developer remains completely silent about the issues.

How can they be silent you wonder? They have devstreams on Twitch regularly.

You are correct, they do. However they never bring up the issues that have plagued the game and frustrated the community for months (even years in some cases). Instead it's showcasing new things coming, showing how they work and other stuff which is nice, but does not address the core frustrations.

I have personally been passionately involved with the game and have over 6000 posts on their forum. But even someone as stubborn and full of grit as myself reaches and end point where even the sunk cost fallacy is unable to convince me that there is a brighter future for the game.

I don't see it. We've tried for years, but the developer has a clear cut aversion for grabbing the bull by the horns and actually bring up the pressing issues with the community and explain either their reasoning for not changing something or a plan for how to address the issues. However... we hear nothing.

I will keep track of the game, play it now and again, but can I recommend this game to others?

No, most certainly not.

Besides the immense grind wall for new players to unlock anything, the fact that the same new players with little, if any  upgrades unlocked, early on get thrown in with veteran players who have pretty much every unlock, upgrade and weapon in the game and the fact that even if the new players endure all that they end up being just as frustrated as, well... the rest of us... then no.

Not recommended at all.

Perhaps in a year or so if they manage to focus on sorting out the core issues of the game that has frustrated the community for years rather than just adding new toys (which inevitably also introduce more issues), but I have little faith in that happening now when it hasn't happened in the past 3 years.


I used to love this game. I used to tell buddies about this game to come try it, hell, I even almost got my girlfriend to play with me not too long ago. I was actually really excited about this game's future. 

But this last update I just cannot recommend the game anymore. 

Before this last patch I used to put up with the moon gravity, the subpar optimization, and the borderline 'P2w' concept, because I liked the devs and I paid a little to support them here and there. 

But with the latest 'T' build, they nerfed the piss out of XP ribbons and grinding for something like the next tier of tanks is almost impossible... Unless you pull out the credit card. 

Want that Easy Eight? $10, or dedicate hundreds of hours to get it. To get ONE tank out of all the career choices, all the tanks, and ALL of the factions you might want to play. 

Want that fancy Pershing? Or Tiger? Or IS-2? $20 bucks or grind even MORE! 

This just isn't a good business model, I understand F2P games need support and funding to keep going, and I was doing just that before the change. But to change your business scheme after you've racked up a decent playerbase is pretty lame in my eyes. Not to mention that these guys hardly even mention anything in the patchnotes about the ribbon nerfs... They just nonchalantly tell us to fuck off and if we don't like it, well tough sh*t.

I was as loyal as they get to Reto and the game, check my hours. But I'm done until fixes are made, and I'm sure as hell not supporting actions like that. 






I loved this game....Loved it.  My friends and I played it almost every night for over a year and that made it VERY fun.  But...with the recent way it has been trending with the updates it is unplayable.  We haven't touched the game since November 2018.  I still have hours of veteran time running as I type this but I can't bring myself to log in anymore.  To put it simply the changes just suck and I hate it.  It is very unfortunate the way the game is headed.  I don't want to seem like the guy who just says "changes suck! I want it the way it was!" but if I wanted to play world of tanks I would have purchased that game instead.  Reto, please, change this back to the way it was.
As much as I like this game and how fun it can be, it has so many problems and setbacks that overcome any sense of fun that you might have. Before I start, I must notify I was Perman-banned for 2 letters in my profile name, although I never saw any rules regarding them when making my account (BonkSS). I played off and on for around a year, and eventually gave in and dropped 20$ in it for a Tanker, and less than 3 days later I was permabanned without notice for said name. 
Even though I practically didn't even wanna play anymore, they decided to give me my 20$ back, but I had to start a new account with no badges and no progress whatsoever. Keep in mind even though with 100 hours into this game I pretty much didn't even have any progress into my old account anyways. 
 To add to this, they're asking players to waste their lives and money into a Beta game with countless bugs and graphical errors. (jumping out of a car and you go through the world, tanks flipping off wood fence posts, panzerfausts not killing you at pointblank range) Some of the bugs can be funny, but are a serious problem when it comes to you spending money on the game.
 The game has it's ultimately fun moments, but are usually buzzkilled by bad balancing, ridiculous trolls, or camping players trying to farm xp rather than capture a point or help their teammates. 
 When it comes to graphics, it has an incredibly washed out pallete of colors, and an ugly haze that's usually so thick you can't see farther than 150 meters, and sometimes less than 50 meters. Aiming is a struggle at first, but you catch onto it when you correct your FOV and mouse sensitivity, but hit registers commonly fail.
 They fixed how bad it was to grind for certain things, that being said it's easier to play. 
This game used to be a really good one, but now we're just left with a money grabbing  machine that only works if you feed it your life or your wallet. Note: I will be paying with my life to continue playing this game despite obvious problems.
I've played a lot of H&G for many years and it has been decent. However the game keeps getting worse with every update. Now  the game sound is absolutely terrible, The vehicles are broken as hell, and planes fall out of the sky and move 20 mph. i could never reccomend a game this terrible in its current state.
The little Dev team that couldn't. The biggest problem with this game is the Dev team. They just don't understand what they want this game to be, or the basics of how to make a good game period. Even though I usually get paid to consult I will give this Dev team a free hint. GAME FLOW!! 
I love WWII FPS games and the potential here is huge. The artwork is so so but passable. The map creation is lacking. The lighting is horrible. The devs need to remember that a person may play for hours so quit trying to ruin their eye sight with horrible lighting and intense fog. It's not cool looking, it's head ache material and a trip to the eye doctor.
The UI is terrible with all kinds of images getting in the way of seeing what you are trying to do which is playing the game. Huge cap point icons in the way of seeing another player. There is a map yanno?
Notice banners pop up in the middle of the screen blocking what you are currently engaged in. To say that's annoying is being polite. And then there is the Deploy Que. Die in the heat of a great battle and then...wait..wait...and wait...in the deploy que. Rule 101 to a good game...NEVER destroy game flow!! There is never a good reason to destroy game flow.
The Grind and pricing. Oh my, where to start. Yes, you want to cause folks to earn that new weapon but making that grind turn into a career is just wrong. Pricing a pistol to cost as much as a tank is beyond belief. Charging folks to pay for weapon repair after every match is just.... well, dumb. As for the weapons themselves well that's easy...look up the stats of each weapon and set them accordingly. Somehow that thought is lost with this dev team. Vehicles made from cardboard that were designed for rough terrain but the slightest bunp in the road sends you spinning out of control. The things that make you go Hmmmm.
The new trendy excuse.."This game is in BETA" is wearing thin and the gamers need to stop supporting this nonsense. Oh, you want to try our new sandwich? That will be $4.50 and here's your two pieces of bun. The sandwich is still in BETA so maybe next month we'll put a slice of cheese between those pieces of bun and then maybe month after that we'll add some mustard to the...you get the idea. You wouldn't tolerate that for one moment so why are you gamers putting up with it in gameing?
I only consider reviewing a game after many hours to make sure I have given a fair shake to the devs. Sadly, this game is something that could be very enjoyable if it were handed over to other devs that know how a game is supposed to work. Save your time, even though it's free, and go play something made by folks with some understanding of what gaming is all about.
I started playing this about 4 years ago when it first came out on Steam. For a little bit, this game seemed quite promising. Yeah, things were a grindfest and some maps were a bit lame, but with every new update your soldiers would get a bunch of XP and in-game currency (which you need to buy new weapons, vehicles, etc.)--making the grind not so bad--and there was a steady supply of new maps and updates.

However, once the game officially went out of beta in 2016, the quick XP and coins from the updates dried up, and it seemed like things were made more expensive and difficult to level up. (Perhaps worst of all, things were changed making it more difficult to get a soldier who was a sniper, tanker, or paratrooper class. You couldn't just level your soldier up and switch class anymore, you had to buy a new class). On top of this, map tweaks to things like spawnpoints ensured you now spent much more time running than fighting.

For a time, it seemed like this game had the potential to fill the large-scale combined arms niche that BF1942 once filled, but now Heroes and Generals is only fun if you're willing to pay piles of money to avoid the grind, or if your soldiers are already leveled up. Even so, it's obvious from the reviews that many veterans are leaving, but if you're a noob with basic equipment, still be prepared to get blasted by people with insane unlocks every time you spawn.

It was fun while it lasted.
This game is worst spending your money and time on. Reto is wayyyy to trigger happy when it comes to banning players. I was banned for no reason during the time I was in the middle of a move to my new house. I sent a ticket into the support center asking why I was banned and what's the proof.The Reto staff members replied with "Be aware we are not obligated to share proof of how this was found." Over the past 3 months players were coincidentally getting banned after they had talked shit about the game. Comment after comments players were getting banned for talking shit. One player was banned for saying the game would never get out of beta. Another player said the game is going to turn to dust in a matter of months or so. Both were banned after they said those comments and both were never heard again. These are just a couple of reasons why you shouldn't download the game.
Reto-Moto, the developer behind this game, simply are not game developers.

As in, they do not understand the most basic, mandatory elements of multiplayer game design.

They allow entire clans, and teams consisting of MULTIPLE clans, as well as other premade groups of skilled players, to be matched up against completely new players with unmodded starter weapons and no experience or skill.

As a result, NOT A SINGLE MATCH of the action game (the FPS part of this game) is EVER decided by skill.

It's ALWAYS decided by whichever side has premade teams or more high ranking, experienced, decked out players.

I know this sounds like a rant, but my hundreds of hours speak for themselves.
I myself have no trouble against experienced, decked out players, because I am one.
However, I play solo queue, without a clan or premade team, so I always end up in a team consisting almost entirely out of newbies and inexperienced players, while the opposing team consistently has premades from clans or at least 1/3 of the team full of veterans.

This is not fair. This is not balanced. This is objectively wrong game design.

Every single game developer over the past decade has understood this simple issue and does not allow premade teams in team based multiplayer games to be matched against solo queue players.

...except Reto-Moto.

Combine that with the M1/M2 and MG42 -- impossible fantasy weapons that make the game play like Unreal Tournament, while everyone else plays a tactical WWII FPS -- and you get a game so blatantly badly designed that not a single match is ever decided by skill, nor is balanced in any way whatsoever.

Stay away. There's a reason this game has been in Early Access for so long.

The developers have absolutely no idea what they're doing.
They don't have a single actual game designer on their team.
If you view their livestreams, you'll know that their entire development team consists of production specialists (3D modeling specialists, animators, texture artists, map builders, etc.).

They have no idea about the mandatory axioms of game design that every developer worth anything has been implementing in games for over a decade now.
I'm afraid I cannot recommend this game. I tried, I played it for a while and I might continue to play it (in a more limited way), but honestly I think I'm done.

There are a few technical problems with the game:
Performance of the game varies highly between updates. I got anything from sustained 60 fps (with vsync on) at high quality setting to 20-25 on the lowest quality.
Weird lag issues. Game freezes momentarily on certain occasions, sometimes at crucial events, eg. just before being killed. This is not related to CPU or memory nor GFX card. I doubt it's network related. If it is, it's server side.

The game also feels a bit unbalanced. If enemy has air superiority, you're doomed. As ground unit there's not a lot you can do. This brings me to the next frustrating fact: you have several characters each has several weapons. You cannot swap [strike]characters or[/strike] weapons during a match. You have to leave the match, leave the squad and then you can swap weapons.

[i]EDIT: apparently you can swap characters if you have more than one of the same class. Thanks to RooZ for bringing this up. I haven't tested it, though. Swapping for a different class is possible if the squad has proper slots[/i]

There's a lot of griding as many have said. Personally I don't mind griding per se. What  I do mind is having to play for extended amount of time at a severe disadvantage. So either you pay money to upgrade fast or you are basically working for Reto as unpaid cannon fodder for their paying customers. In some games if you're good you may get a fighting chance. But not here. As infantry - yes. As tank crewman, not really. You will be put against superior tanks that you cannot harm with your puny cannon. And when you die you'll have to wait before spawning again and then walk or drive for a while to get to the action. There's a lot of waiting and walking in this game. I guess that makes it a more realistic military simulation. ;)

The grind is the price of a free game you say. Fair enough. However this game also suffers from the same problems as any other FPS, free or not. The lack of teamplay. When I first started playing H&G I saw how team actions (capturing) actually gives you significantly more score points compared to just killing an enemy. I said "wonderful, they found a way to make people actually do objectives". Sadly I was mistaken. Points schmoints. There are still very few people who will actively engage in coordinated cooperative gameplay. You'll get a circle of campers just outside capture zone. People will use resources without considering they're limited and waste them. Tank drivers will not rotate tanks so that support gunners may engage targets. Vehicles with MGs are never parked with their guns facing enemy positions. A fair amount will not follow common sense regarding objective selection and some will even roam aimlessly around the map.

I'd gladly pay money for a game with a nice teamplay-oriented community but this one isn't it.

So, should you play this free game? After all I said I might continue. If you do, stick to infantry, most vestatile, easiest to survive. Get a car or a motorbike to get from spawn area to the action. If you go for any other class, expect a lot more grinding and consider that your leveling strategy and point investment may be subverted by game designers at any point.
The developers don't care about the community, instead of fixing the game they release useless updates that nobody wants and make the game even worse most of the time.

Their way of balancing is by increasing the price of things that are OP. So if you have a soccer 1v1 with a 9 year old vs Messi, it would be balanced by Reto's logic because Messi costs more.  ???
After 500+ hours I think I have to write something about this game.

First of all I like this game a would recommend, BUT...

Do you like grinding? If Yes this is the game for You, becouse it has a ton of it. You have to grind everything, some of it are fairly easy to grind (for example MP40, thats not that bad of a grind), bet there are a lot others like the STG44 which takes an awful lot of time. Ofc you can BOOST everything. Sidenote: You can buy EVERYTHING with credits (in-game non-paid currency) which is nice. I think credit-earning wise the game is well balanced (could be better). With a little smart management you will never get -credits after a match (refills, repair, etc.). But you have to grind. After 500+ hour I still did not unlocked everything, not even with one nation.

I almost missed the most important, in this game you prefferably have more soliders (you can't change your loadout during a match) for example: Infantry with machine gun, infantry with rifle, medic infantry, anti-tank infantry, tanker, pilot, paratrooper, recon. And wathever you like.

Personally I think Veteran bonus not that strong. I only use it when we get it from promotion or holiday etc. The bonus credit and the 2nd badge slot is the best part of the veteranship (which you can also buy from credits). But you can play without them.

I think in the last year the game was really underwhelming. They added a lot of unuseful things or things that further worsening the grind. They added baby pistols, so you have much worse pistols to grind the better ones.
The worst thing came not too long ango that they prioritized the addition of HELM SKINS over VEHICLE HANDLING improvement (which is awful, we really need to patch that btw.).

The matches are qiute fun if you can get over the early grind (you are bind to an unmodded G43 at the start of every character, its very frustrating after the 2nd or 3rd infantry assault grind). The spawnpoints are mostly placed awful, there are points that almost impossible to capture with a decent enemy, and there are points where you spawn 1km away from the point, with no bike or civil vehicle to get to the point. Running simulator is real. There are still spawncamping, but its not that bad than earlier.

To be a pilot in this game is the hardest thing, but also VERY rewarding. But tanking is really bad as it is for now. Do you know how many enemies needed to destroy a König Tiger? Just one. They can ride their bikes to you, throw 2-4 bombs at you or shoot you with a bazooke 2-4 times and you are destroyed, can't do anything. And there are dedicated players for this. They just roam around and hunt tanks. And very hard to notice them becouse the sounds in this game... really need some improvment.

Oh yeah, I almost forgot, there is a thing in this game which is really disgousting, its called ASSIMETRIC BALANCE. For example, russians have their armored cars, and PTRD which have no alternatives in other nations. The light tanks and the tank destroyers got some assimetric things too. I mean historywise its fine, but it can be really frustrating, But you can still have your fun.

The WAR mode is what really keeps me playing. The matches are more rewarding (more with underpopulation bonus, least played nations earn more stuff). The word map and the assault team management is a really awesome conception. After you reach lvl 12 you can manage your own troops on the worldmap and support players playing on thoose battlefields (for example sending them 30 infantry and 12 bikes to spawn). This will be your primary XP source after lvl12. And its fun.

I really hope devs will not abandon this game, they should focus a lil bit more on important stuff (e.g. BUG FIXES, new maps, new weapons (but not like these baby pistols), etc) and less on skins and unimportant sh*t. But for I will give a NO, but I will be happy to change that.
This game is free to play, but it is such a heaping pile of garbage that it's not even worth the time of day really.

The developers don't listen to the community, they ruin the game, they only want your money, the game is in a constant state of decay, year old bugs remain unfixed, and WHEN developers DO comment on some of the suggestions people give, the answer is always "We just don't have the resources to do this.", yet they have the resources to make a new "better" sound system that no one wanted. It basically makes it seem like you're wearing earplugs all the time.

The game is excruciating to start off, because once you get past level two, you're instantly thrown into matches with level 15's, 17's, which all happen to have top-tier equipment, vehicles, badges (like perks from CoD). This game is the laughing stock of the ww2 genre and the developers are painfully incompetent.

In January they laid out plans for what they wanted to do this year (2017). It's two thirds through JUNE and they have nothing to show for it. They have ONE coder, ONE artist, for a game this big? Give me a break. Reto should just throw in the towel, or hand the game over to a company that knows what they're doing, and then fire all the original Reto staff as they're just so bad at doing anything right.

As a free to play game, they had really two ways to go about things. One, being they actually listen to the community, and make a great game, that can really prosper in the long run. Or TWO: Make everything about the money, and cater to what the people with the fat wallets really want. The CAMOS for your soldier's UNIFORM are more expensive than any vehicle in the entire game!

Every single update they make to this game just breaks it more and more, and every update is just a blatant money grab. The developers are so incompetent they make Mr. Bean look like a genius.

I'm writing this review so that all you people out there looking to invest time, let alone MONEY into this game, DO NOT do it. DO NOT make the same mistake that I or countless other people have made in hopes that they would use your money to hopefully better the game. Instead, they run to the bank laughing with not just your money. But your time, salt, and tears as well.

DO NOT play this game.
Review for Herpes & Generals

Pros:
+6 different classes
+3 factions 
+Lots of neato weapons and vehicles
+Tanks, planes
+Big maps
+Upgradeable weapons, you can increase damage, range etc
+It's F2P
+Updated several times a year

Cool beans?

Cons:
-Recon class is glorified infantry sniper
-Infantry snipers
-Paratrooper class is completely broken
-Anti-air vehicles are complete garbage
-Playing tank crew is basically stepping into a coffin, anti-tank infantry will blow you to shit

-Planes with infinite bombs carpet bombing the control points
-This game could really use some new maps
-Every bullet counts. Literally, since you have to pay for every bullet you fire during a game. Same goes for other weapon upgrades, explosives and medkits
-Squad system is awful (squad leader decides where on the map you spawn and what classes you can play)
-Relatively poor optimization
-Maps get repetitive after a while
-Devs focusing on adding cosmetic items and more planes instead of balancing what they already have in the game
-Other problems regarding Combat Badges
-Very, very grindy. Ridiculously grindy.

Other stuff that bothers me personally
~No historical accuracy (US fighting SU in a french town etc)
~Ingame weapons are NOT like real life (900 RPM gun fires at 400 ingame etc)
~Some of the anti-air guns are useless due to placement on the maps
~As a tanker, hearing a bicycle is scarier than seeing a tank destroyer
~Weapon sway while ADS can get a bit extreme on scoped rifles and some SMGs
~Some guns sound pretty bad, but they are getting updated
~Repair costs can get really high for your weapons/explosives to the point where you just barely make a profit


Do you like hardcore WW2 FPS? Get Red Orchestra 2 or Day of Infamy. 
Do you like arcady WW2 FPS? Get CoD: WW2 or wait for Battalion 1944.
You want something between those two types of games? If so, buckle up, because you're up for a long and grindy ride.
First thing off, don't let the preview screenshots fool you into believing that game actually looks like that. Those screenshots are graphically enhanced... meaning the graphics in the game looks nothing like them.

I started playing this game a year ago, in April of 2015. I have had 730 hours in the game. I have written 2 previous reviews for this game. The first one was a negative one that I wrote after playing the game for 2 months, and spent 200 hours on it. The second review was a positive one after playing the game for 5 months and having spent 400 on it.

Now this is my third review of this game, and I am sad to have to change my overwhelming positive review to a negative one. This game has been slowly going down hill for the past 6 months/updates (since they have an update every month).

Though most of negative stuff I have to say comes from the update 4 months ago (the Adam's Build).

The main problem with this game has always been how the developers at Reto decide to "balance" things. The problem is so obvious to everyone on the forums except Reto to the point that we all joke about it. We call it "Reto Logic™". 

The problem with "Reto Logic™" is that they make the most absurd and silly excuses and reasons to do the most crude, unpolished, illogical methods of attempting to balance the game.

For instance, tank drivers can't initiate a manual reload for their turret mounted coaxial machines guns, or autocannons if you have a Panzer II tank. Reto claims that this is done for game balance... but meanwhile all other vehicles' support machine guns can be reloaded at any given time... Even the support gunner machine gun on a tank can be reloaded... So instead of doing something more logical for the sake of balance like giving the tank driver a slower reload, they just completely disable the ability to reload at all... and the only way for you to reload is by wasting all your ammo in your current clip which not only gives away your position, but wastes extra time.

Another example is the American M1919 .30 Browning Machine Gun. Most players complain that the rangefinder (iron sight) on the gun is way to optically obstructive for the gun to be used effectively, and ask for it to be flipped down. Reto says no, tells us that the rangefinder blocking most of your screen is there for balance. So instead of balancing the gun statistically, they decide to basically blind the user instead.

Another example of "Reto Logic™", is instead of simply tweaking stats accordingly they basically decided in the past couple of months just to make every gun unusable. For instance they have been adding muzzle residue clouds to all automatic guns... this wouldn't be a problem at all if they were simply just small highly transparent aesthetic animations.... but no they are large, densely dark residue clouds that are equivalent to a black powder musket discharges that is enough to blind the user.

Not only did they add that. They added a conefire system. Now you may think that conefire means weapon or bullet spread... but no... it doesn't. Conefire is this stupid massive RNG weapon sway, that makes it look like your character's arm is made out of jello... where your character is constantly just moving his arms around in a large drunk wide random circular motion that prevents you from ever getting an accurate precise shot.

So this game went from a good skill based FPS game, to a drunk blind pray and spray RNG simulator all in one update.

And if that wasn't bad enough... The game has extremely poor lighting and sun glare effect. Not to mention black hole shadows.

Where the majority of the game's graphics has this dark grey filter over it which Reto said they added because of "Pixel Hunters", where people use to be able to see enemy soldiers so far off to the distance...  like 200 meters away where they appeared to be only a few pixels, and still managed to spot and kill them. So after adding this terrible grey soup filter to the game... most players a lot of times can't even see enemy soldiers at 10 or 20 meters in front of them.

Then add that on with the black hole shadows... where entire bright green, or whitish grey tanks can become almost invisible in plain sight when sitting in the shadows.

Then lets not forget the sun glare... the sun glare is unnaturally bright, and is static. It doesn't dynamically change intensity or shape at different viewing angles. Even when going into a shady spot where the sun isn't shinning on your character, you still get sun glare no matter what. Even if you're in a building with solid walls where the sun doesn't shine. The only time the sun glare goes away is if you have the sun at your back at an  angle of somewhere between 175 to 185 degree .

Also this game for the past entire year that I have been playing, they still hasn't fixed the firing sound and animation bug. Where most of shots fired by someone else makes no sound at all and has no muzzle flash. This is extremely detrimental bug to have in an FPS game because it is literally the difference between life and death. Where someone can be standing literally 2 meters away from you, trying to shoot you in the back, and you simply won't hear at all. They might shoot 20 rounds at you before you even hear the first shot sound. Or a magically invisible enemy tank sitting in the shadows 10 meters right in front of you can be shooting its cannon, and you will never even know its there.

So in short why do I not recommend this game? Because the developers at Reto do not have any idea how to balance the game. They use the most bizarre illogical unrefined hack slashed methods to balance the game, by simply removing basic game mechanic functionality, trying to blind players in every way possible, dumbing down the gunplay mechanics to the point where your aiming ability doesn't matter at all since whether you hit or not due to the fact that your soldier holds his gun as if he is drunk and has jello for arms and its pure RNG base.

This game has a lot more problems than just what I mentioned in this review, but this is the stuff that you will encounter first thing off when you start playing the game as an infantryman.

Also if you're considering becoming a tanker in this game... just remember, the higher the tier the tank is, the more expensive it is, the more easier it is to be killed, and the more inaccurate it's coaxial machine gun is. Yeah you read that right... the more expensive and better armored a tank is... the more it sucks and easier to be killed in. Because the bigger and more armored your tank is, the slower it moves, which just makes it easier for infantrymen with sticky grenades (hand held anti-tank nukes) to run up to you and instantly vaporize you as if you're sitting in a aluminium foil toy car.
This game used to have potential. It used to be fun. Then came update after update that made the game worse. The last update (1.12) is so broken that I can no longer recommend this game to any new players.

The developers decided to cater to a small part of whining noobs in the game (tankers), and buff them to the point that hte game is no longer fun for anyone else. As a result the game is no longer fun for the main class in the game - infantry. This was once an awesome combined arms game. Now it's becoming a poor rip-off to world of tankers.

Most of all it's just another sign that the developers just do not have a damn clue where to take this game. The last few years have seen update after update that made the game objectively worse, breaking 2 new things for every single thing that was fixed. Warnings and feedback are continuously ignored while new broken updates are released. As a result most veterans players with thousands of hours - and most infantry players, have already left the game. At this point what remains in the game is only nostalgic players hoping for better times in a game that is no longer as fun as it once was, and many noob tanks hoping to HE spam poor new players into oblivion. 

If you aspire to become someone's cannonfodder, this game is for you. If you want a frustrating experience as a new player, this game is for you. 
If you want to have fun... look further.
If you want to have proper fights with tanks... just get War Thunder or World of Tanks instead of this broken shit...

Addition (16 october 2018):
Just to give an idea of how they're handling the situation. I already know multiple vets on the forums who got their forum accounts banned for their 'dissenting voices' regarding this update. Posts adressing this issue get removed. 

Why do they prefer to silence dissent from well-intending players with thousands of hours in the game who are sad to see this game being broken, instead of listening to them?

Using moderating powers to muzzle veterans is a sign of weakness... not strength. If only they listend to feedback as acutely as they swing the banhammer around at the same people.

If you're looking for a company that will use nazi censorhip tactics on long-term customers when they don't agree with them? Look no further, this is the place to spend your money!
Squad system is broken. I spent an entire map caping and defending a forward point. Spawning allies in my jeep and ratatatting from the gunner seat. Then about 40 seconds before victory, 'YOUR SQUAD LEADER HAS REMOVED YOU FROM THE SQUAD" and my game was over.

That's after waiting 9 minutes for a server.

I enjoy the vehicles and combat.  The microtransactions and poorly implimented mechanics are causing me to uninstall.
This game gives you a hint of really fun gameplay, but ruins it with money and frustration.
I want to like this game, I really do, but they just fucked everything up so badly.

The developers need to realise that not everything can be pay to win, and that progression needs to be steady. This game was so much better back in it's beta than it is now.

This game is not worth your time, total pay to win, don't waste your time.
Hi,

I played this game since 2014 - my steam records only show a small fraction of the time I spent since I downloaded and used the game without steam in the standalone version.

Short:
I highly advise against spending your time and money on this game. The devs are US biased that is not a secret. They are not focused on the quality of the game rather the quantity of the players. The target of the game are not the long term players - the weekly 200 new players are more important than the veterans who play for 5 years (weekly 20 leave). The quantity if the equipments is more important than the quality. You can also see everywhere that the strategy now is advertisement and marketing (new UI for the website and teasers for every update and lots of social media activity and twitch partnerships) and the money spent on the quality of the game is rather small.

Conclusion: 
You log in you are stunned how fancy and what a massive quantity of guns and vehicles you have ->
You spend money to skip the loooong time needed to unlock them ->
 You realize that was a mistake and you face all the huge issues of the game -> 
You quit the game ->
They win cz the money you gave will be spent on marketing and looks and appeal so that even more will fall into it.

Long:
Germany started to have all the pro fps players from red orchestra and since in the beginning there was not Soviet faction pro fps gamer russians also joined Germany. All sorts of noob players started to swarm Germany and the better players were winning the wars so they nerfed Germany to the ground.

That still didn't stop the overpopulation of the German faction. Soviets were added(Humiliating US and Germany with their secret spawn time bonus which was revealed by players and hastely removed after a half year of Soviet domination). Underdog bonus was added but they still couldnt solve anything in that matter so they decided to nerf the Germans even more and whenever they add anything new to the other factions it will be a guaranteed overkill to germany - instead of listening to the community in this matter.

There are obvious problems in the game which they refuse to fix and instead they add unwanted equipment and ridicoulusly rare ww2 guns and vehicles and skins. They rather feel like working against the community by ignoring all the problems and adding unwanted things to the game instead. The customers are not a focus here and that is a sign of bad management.

Good example: We used to have only one type of planes. That one type ended up for the US in the heavy fighter category meaning after the plane update every US pilot had the heavy fighter already. The freshly added german and Soviet heavy fighters are slower, they have a larger turn angle and wing mounted guns which render them imprecise a little but that alone is not a big deal. This effectively means that you cant get rid of a US heavy plane, you cant outmanouver or outrun it. No matter what manouver you do they will be able to follow you and if you try to catch them they can easily lose you. They dominate the air 100% in the heavy fighter category and they do so in fact so much that in only about 2-4% of the matches do the US pilots have any enemy at all(these are most likely ppl who just unlocked the german or the soviet heavy and they want to try it). 

After 1.5 years of total US heavy air domination the CEO had no idea about it and Reto Gargamel said that there is probably no issue and it could be only the fact that players see the p38 the most cz it used to be a starter plane and its unlocked for everyone who played before the air update. Thats it...
https://heroesandgenerals.com/2018/07/did-you-miss-yesterdays-ama/?utm_source=ingameHub&utm_medium=IngameHub&utm_campaign=IngameHub

Some other examples:
Tanks: Tank gameplay still unplayable due to tank hunter infantry and the unfair repair costs for tanks above light tanks. 

Planes: OP38 still rocks the heavy fighter class and none even dares to challange since it costs a gigaton of credits to spawn it. General control update to the planes killed the fun and its too easy to control them. You can still kill people in the water if you drop your bomb into the river.

Poor infantry: Infantry gameplay is somewhat fun but the hitbox problems, the unresolved problem of lagging players, bullets stuck in the air 10cm above the frame of a window, heavy set on everyone so players who don't have vet membership suffer, Infantry scopes deter people from playing the objective... these are issues that were around for 4 years.

Recons: You can very easily end up negative or break even when you play a recon with OHK sniper. Still no XP for spotting. Recons are sill only rewarded for capturing which is not suitable for the scoped gun and the lack of equipment slots. New maps make the long range sniper kills a lot harder. The whole recon gameplay needs a redesign.

General issues: The maps are the same although they have been redesigned they are still the same boring maps. Repair costs are still way above sensible. New players are just thrown into the meatgrind. Clans are still allowed to play against randomly grouped players. Game modes are also boring and the encounter game mode is just even worse.

There are a lot more examples but time is short and here is what I observed:

The weekly X new players are the target of this game. Quantity of guns and vehicles and maps and skins instead of quality.
By the time you realize this you spent a lot of money and you played for a short time which is profitable versus the veterans who dont spend that much money and they reveal major issues.

Conclusion: 
You log in you are stunned how fancy and what a massive quantity of guns and vehicles you have ->
You spend money to skip the loooong time needed to unlock them ->
 You realize that was a mistake and you face all the huge issues of the game -> 
You quit the game ->
They win cz the money you gave will be spent on marketing and looks and appeal so that even more will fall into it.

THIS IS A TRAP
This game is actually very very FUCKED. The developers don't do shit, they don't listen to shit, and they do the exact opposite to what the players want. Player base is fucking dead now too, queue times go over 4 minutes while back then, queue times were only a few seconds. Its fine to dick around, but if you want to put money? Buy gold? use it somewhere else.


Update: So I hear the fuckos at Reto Moto are planning a revive with a new armor update of some kind, will be keeping my eye on that but I have thus far quit the game. A warning for anybody whom wish to still play this worthless thing: DO NOT JOIN CLANS, the clan aspect of this game is absolutely toxic, constant clan wars, delusional leaders, and an overall generality of idiocy, you're better off playing this with a group of friends and goofing off.
This game used to be fun. And after putting 1000+ hours in this game, they finally managed to completely turn me away from what I believed would have a very good chance to be an actual game at a certain point. There have been ups and down, but after this 'everhart' update, it feels like I was getting my testicles removed by a hammer....one....at...... time. This update pretty much tried to make the game much more immersive but in reality it just cloaked over the teleportation when you get off a vehicle, bike or tank.There are so many unbalances on what is supposed to be "balanced" matches. The grind on this is so extensive, relentless changes on the Main Menu in order to "beautify" it, long time limits to get into matches, community tends to bias mostly germans (from what ive noticed in all the time if played), etc. One big negative impact is the lack of maps. Over the span of these 2 years that i've played there has only been two maps that were new, TWO YEARS FOR TWO MAPS?! As for trying to implement WW2 historical accuracy, some of the weapons are solid although there has been a lot of calls for "OP" guns that need a NERF (every game will have this). The tanks are positive on my list, but the planes were slow as it was but now they are SLOW, REALLY DANG SLOW. Honestly just dont bother with this game. Save your time for other games that have better game mechanics and you can actually call a game. Still in BETA...SMFH......
Let's start off with, I really want to love this game... I really do. Unfortunately, the game has more problems than innovation and immersion.

Pros: 
+ MMOFPS with every weapon and vehicle customisable
+ 18 vs 18 battles
+ A big variety of maps
+ Tons of aquirable vehicles and guns, along with support stuff (like medkit, binos, etc...)
+ Choosable class after lvl 5 (Tanker, sniper, para, and so on...)
+ Free to play
+ Can sometimes be addicting (just one more match)

Cons:
- Free to play, therefor
- Grindfest (like, if you are not veteran, you wont earn anything at all)
- Mandatory 387+ skins to be released before any patch comes out
- Unbalanced teams
- Unbalanced weapons
- Weapons and skins cost the same as heavy tanks, not even getting into the price of the skins
- Little to no teamplay, toxic chat
- Frequent encounter with hackers (despite latest patch)
- It's not a game, it's a chore...
- Badly optimised. Even with highest settings enable, its like playing a pixelart RPG from 2012. Try to aim down the sight, when al you see instead of a line are three pixel dots vertically aligned.

In my opinion, anyone is better off with Post Scriptum, Red Orchestra, or Day of Infamy. Hope one day I will be able to give this game a positive review.
Seeing as though the devs are deleteing all negative feedback from the forums guess id better place my thoughts here.

Heroes and Generals is a very ambitous game with some great aspects, Its fun to play and will keep you entertained for hours.

Here comes the but

The Developers of this game are so unbelivably bad at what they do, the greatest weakpoint of the game is them. After they decided to shaft all the vets with massive restrictions they then proceeded to sweep all negative reviews under the rug. Reto-moto is some Hitler level corrupt.

It seems every decsions they make for the game was made by highschool footballers high on dope
"WOAH BRO THAT SOUNDS DOPE, LETS NOT PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO IT AND JUST DO WHAT WE WANT ON IMPULSE"

Do not under any circumstance play this game......you will leave feeling like an empty void of dissapoinment

A lot of pay to win features (like two perks at once) that give paying people blatant advantages.
If you are a free to play player the amount of grinding is insane. It can take weeks just for a small upgrade.
The maps are big and as a result most people have 1 hit kill snipers, so unless you buy a jeep or tank or your own sniper, you can enjoy dying repeatedley to unseen enemies. 
Gun play is a little satisfying, but unbalanced guns are very present.
3/10
The game used to be great, now the dev ruined it and said multiple times that they don't care about community feedback. I would avoid this game. With the new update you even have to grind before you can play with a few friends. You have to grind SO MUCH for anything. You might get a few hours out of fun but that's it. With friends it would be better, but the devs  don't want that anymore and put it behind a grind wall.
I won't give you a wall of text. What I will give you is positive and negative points, and allow you to decide for yourself.

==Positive==
+Online
+Multiplayer
+FPS
+Tanks
+Planes
+Weapon modification system (tweak triggers, switch ammos, etc.)
+Large maps
+Tactical gameplay
+Diverse community (noobs, vets, and everything inbetween)

==Negative==
-Hard on your PC
-Massive grind
-Very low TTK on guns, leads to ping wars at times
-High prices, with low profits from playing
-No tutorial (FPS side)
-Poorly designed game engine
-No tutorial (RTS side)
-No option to turn off tooltips ('Press "E" to enter vehicle' gets annoying- fast.)
-Generally bad weapon sounds
-Lack of any real immersion
-Can buy currency and veteran memberships, but they're near worthless
-Development is catering way too much towards the newbies
-No VOIP
-Awkward squadding system

==Neutral points==
=Easy to report people
=Team damage can be reported
=Alt accounts are allowed, just not to get around a ban.


Heroes and Generals, the free-to-play experience.

When you start off the game as a new player, specifically infantry, it is damn near impossible to get into a game where everyone is at a "equal" match rank. You start off with a Gewehr, Grant, or SVT (depends on faction) that takes 3 hits to kill anyone, that's not factoring in the dollar store hit detection. And in a more experienced lobby,  it becomes near impossible to really enjoy the game due to everyone else possessing fully auto fire arms or sniper rifles, and gunning you down in the seconds of getting seen in close quarters, or getting shot from seemingly nowhere in an empty field. Now, as a free to play player, it takes nearly twice as long or even more to grind out some of the better weapons as you really lack any firepower to compete against any other weapons with the starting rifles, with that, you can't really make any money because you end up spending most of the round running to a point and dying.

Gameplay:
Don't listen to anyone when they say that weapons are based on skill or that you need better aim to do well. This games damage numbers are like drawing from a lottery, random inconsistent numbers, never seemingly enough to net you a kill. LMG's are literally a joke (Johnson), they are capable of engaging at any range and out trading nearly any weapon with little to no modifications, and the only way to really deal with this is with fully modded gear that ends up costing more than you earn. Tanks in this game against infantry, think about it like a shooting range, where you are the targets, incapable fighting back as you'll be lucky if those Panzersfausts you find on the field even net you xp when you hit the tanks. Playing as a new player in these types of matches really test ones patience as you get smited by HE's every moment that you're alive. Instead of a match where you're looking for players to pvp with, you'll spend most of the round respawning while getting camped by a higher tier tank. Reminder, these are all things that you'd have to face as a starting player, when you have no real impact on a game regardless of what you do, and you would have to continue to experience this every single game until you've sunk enough hours and money to become relevant in a match. Normally you would be playing in an encounter to get experienced to the game, but that doesn't quite work because of how the match making works, it only takes one player with a high level weapon to completely turn the match into a firing range.

Team play:
Everyone has bad games, that's true for everyone, but maybe a slight bit more often than one would like in this game. More often than not your teammates end up being more of an obstacle to you than the enemy team is, you can go into a gold tier match but get matched up with players that are just beginning the game or are still in the suffering grind to be able to play the game. Your performance, no matter how well you may play, can cause you a defeat anyways.

Conclusion:
Don't pick up the game unless you have a tremendous amount of time to waste or if you're in the process of trying to lose your mind. The grind is not worth the grind, the gameplay is not fun or intuitive in any way. If suffering sounds like fun to you, then go give this game a try. Otherwise, there are much better choices out there.

Great concept, awful execution. Every gameplay mechanic imaginable is broken in some way or another. Hackers run rampant and the anticheat will never catch them because it is pathetic much like the game. After 4 years, many of the same bugs errors and much more remain everyday problems, and every update only makes them worse and or creates new problems. The developer follows it's 'silent majority' path every single time something needs adressed, and you and I both know its so they can make another quick buck.

The player grind has been made worse and worse (revised ribbon system, revised squad system) and the only way to avoid it is to play for insane number of hours or buy gold. Even should you play upwards of 80 hours a week you will never get anywhere because of the ridiculous amount of crap to do in order to have a well balanced character set. The tank and plane system is horrendously broken, and the weapons are absolutely screwed, there are constant buffs/nerfs going on everything and none of the weapon stats at any point make any sense. Can you name a game where bolt action rifles take 3 hits to kill until they're 'upgraded'? Didn't think so, but thats okay because you can make them kill in one hit but its prohibitively expensive until you're a higher level or buy insane amounts of gold. The 'war bonds' system is absolutely ridiculous, you can invest a nearly real $400 USD of gold to get back something like $20 worth of gold (only after a 3 month wait, naturally). After Rommel deployment queues became ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and now you get even worse, more easily camped locations to spawn in. The RTS system has been and continues to be seriously broken. You used to even be able to buy guns and mods for them with gold, but now you have to unlock or buy the 'ribbons' (XP) for them first. Veteran (P2W) memberships used to yield actual ingame credit boosts, but those have naturally been nerfed over and over. Veteran is now being forced down any 'expert' players throat because you are literally being required to buy it to access the previously standard (two) combat badge slots. If this is the way they want their game to be, they should just bring in a $100 pack that unlocks all the crap you'd need. The game only becomes increasingly harder to actually play as a 'new guy' or 'f2p', its actually unbelievable to see this happen to what was the WW2 game with the most potential for a while.

The new sound occlusion system is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, you can't even tell if people are firing right next to you or not because "theres something in the way". Hit registration is ridiculous and the servers haven't gotten any better. The matchmaking system is so bad that its possible to get all tanks vs all airplanes (and I've even seen it happen). Shaders got way worse and the graphics haven't gotten a tad better since even Alpha. All guns are now loaded up with ridiculously bright and unrealistic tracers, although surely this wasn't made to combat snipers since you can now carry over 4 medkits as a single infantryman. The weight system makes not a shred of sense, and even after bringing Paratroopers back they made them useless by disallowing them to carry anything. Your character will need to move by foot most of your time throughout gameplay, but everyone has severe asthma even with *those* 'upgrades', and then the snipers will finish you off after all that running now that shoulder turns into jello and cannot be used to stabilize your rifle or machine gun. Even if they don't, you will be slaughtered by tanks. This effectively makes the entire spawn system useless. The vehicle physics suck, cars will do a 180 degree spin at the slightest turn, motorcycles will absolutely spaz out whenever and wherever possible, and bicycles (the one free to use method of transport) also act like crap.

Although none of this matters when they ban your account because you are doing too good, and I'm serious about this. It seems that when you actually start buying gold and or getting more skillful, that you are banned for "cheating", as it's happened to me twice and it seems that I'm not the only person with this issue -- Please read other negative reviews and you will see more evidence of this. The only time the devleopment team arrives to talk to players is when they write up intelligent arguments and complaitns like those in this review. Game mechanics are written with making another penny in mind, and thats practically it. At least half if not more of the updates in recent memory add a new camoflauge or some other dumb thing to keep you spending money on the game, even though not a single person asked for any of this crap. The only reason this isn't in "beta" anymore is because steam would've removed it from the platform. For the amount of money they must make from all this junk its amazing that they don't just add EAC or BattlEye, but then again that would unfortunately kill off about 2/3 of their buying playerbase, hackers that just keep coming back. The people behind this game are not developers, developers understand basic elements of a multiplayer game, Reto does not.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL:DR Fun for about 2-3 hours, and then it becomes crushingly impossible AND/OR expensive. Developers are toxic, greedy and fraudulent, the game slowly dies more and more every day, and soon Reto-Moto shall be remembered as "The Little Dev Team That COULD NOT", that is until they move onto their next massive scam of a project. Unless you are okay with a 500 hour grind for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game that will force you to start over by banning you, stay away.
This game was good way back when. Now its trash the devs dont care about it. All new players queue against max gear players that can one shot or have the best auto rifles. Game is unbalanced and unfair and will never be fixed. AVoid this game and find a better one and to the ones who wont leae cause of their time invested just leave so they drop this garbage off of steam. Worst dev team and worst game to ever touch my library EVER
This game has an awful lot of potential. 
Unfortunately the Devs Reto.Moto seem deadset on killing this potential.

Pros: 
 - Free to Play.
 - No limitations in terms of playable factions or gear setup.
 - Multiple classes with different equipment available

Cons:
 - Obvious bias towards certain factions.
 - Frequent updates that only make existing issues/complaints worse
 - Placebo Anti-Cheat (it really does nothing to prevent exploiters)
 - Heavily P2W
 - Fairly toxic community
 - Terrible matchmaking/Servers
 - Devs have no actual care for the players

If you want a proper Online WWII game, I'd recommend spending a few dollars and buying Red Orchestra 2 instead.

Well, what can i say. This game is pretty bad in my opinion. The money you make is pretty low and to unlock the weapons you want you need to grind tons and tons in this game. Not only that you also go up against people that have spent money on the game and they in contrast to you have better and stronger weapons and vehicles. Making one-shot snipers and killing you from long ranges whiles you run around with a pretty bad primary. Not only that but you have to pay to repair your equipment and resupply, and that costs you your hard earned credits in game. So effectivly the small amount of credits that you do get, become even smaller. Not to mention how unoptimized this game is for computers, with a NVIDIA GTX 1080 and an i7 7700 and more i don't get good fps in this game. Makes me sad that WW2 based games always flop for me, like Battlefield 5 this game makes me sad.

I would go against playing this game, but if you wanna fuck around with friends it's great fun but that's about it. All my hours of playing is literally of playing with my friend and fucking around, i've mad no progress that is worth looking into.
Used to love this game, not so much any more. Coming back to it, it seems like it's only gotten worse and worse. There's little improvement, and it's usually overshadowed by the constant flaws. If you're planning on spending cash on this game, go buy Red Orchestra instead.
--TLDR FOR BEGINNERS--
--ONCE YOU HIT RANK 6 YOU ARE GOING TO GET DESTROYED BY VETS WITH OP WEAPONS! --

Ninja price increases? Check! (Have fun grinding 80hours (estimated) just to be able to buy a class )

Weak starter weapons? Check! (Have fun grinding 10 hours to unlock your weapon mods and ~20-40 hours to get the credits again to actually buy the mods) Check!

Have fun being cannonfodder for ~150hours until you get some decent weapons. That's not fun to me!




-LONG TERM PERSPECTIVE: --
Ninja price increase of 200% with a small micropatch although the costs are already too high. (100 hours pure farmtime to unlock sniper class without weapons...wtf)
God forbid you actually farm 100 hours to buy a class, there is an auxiliary "seats" bullshit system which forbids you to swap your class freely ingame. Check! (Heavy restrictions!)

Once you start progressing in the game and reach level 6 you will get destroyed by veterans with better weapons? (I am a veterans usually having a 5-15 kdr in encounter mode vs. newbies. That ain't fun) Check! 

Recent update ruined planes & air combat resulting in 20 minutes of flying in circles because i can not hit my opponent and neither can he hit me. Check! (It took me 4-5 seconds to take down an avarage skilled pilot prepatch!)

Oh btw: You used to get the best fighter plane by unlocking a pilot in the game, but once they've patched in the new shitty "recon" MG planes you actually have to unlock and pay for the best fighter plane in the game which you used to get for free! (One example of a stealthy price increase for new players!)


THIS GAME IS HEAVILY PAY TO WIN! I would not bother to start playing this game today since reto is patching in more and more bullshit restrictions in favour of $$$.

I used to buy premium time and gold in this game, but the ripoff has gone too far. Therefore i am voting with my wallet and refuse to support this game any longer.

Marketing: 0/10 
Game is a 7/10


I've been playing this game for the last sixto seven years and after all this time, the game has slowly been turning into rubbish. The last update, Armour 2.0 completely wrecked the game. Reto was trying to go for a more realistic modular armour approach to tank combat but instead completely threw any logic out the window and failed miserably. This may not make perfect sense for someone who has never played the game, but for example, it took me 15+ hits to kill a Hellcat tank with my Panther. Only for the tanker to bail and for someone else to claim the acutal tank kill. I ended up with zero reward for that kill and instead took all of the damage. None of the other players took any damage from the encounter. The so called "balance" that the developers tried to create messed up the balance there was before the update. Don't let this game fool you into palying it with the free to play and fancy graphics. It's a cluster f*** of veteran players destroying novice players. The grind for weapons is terribly long now and frustating. Famous youtubers used to stream and play this game but every single one slowly left because of how the developers treat veteran players. No respect. None. This game was a blast to play back in 2015 but now after successive "updates", the game is pathetically ruined.
The new update has ruined the game.Can't believe it took me 500hrs to realise this game was a grind and a waste of my time. Even after a few updates they have decided to change a few bits but ehh still mixed feelings.
Good game early on but when you get into the main battles of the game the wars, that's when it gets annoying. The whole game is either one shot rifle killing or jumping on tanks. The one shot rifle makes all other weapons useless and tanks are nother more than a small hurdle. It's a shame because when it was first released it was one of my favourite games to play.
This game was really good a long time ago but has gone downhill ever since. pure cancer right now. The balance is poor (does not exist). The maps are bad and not adapted to the new (antigravity) vehicle update. The grinding is very painful. Many annoying bugs that will not be fixed. And so on.....
Goddamn.
I use to love this game
In fact i still really do.
But this new update, the squad update, Really shivered me timbers.
While i still play this game, i can not reccomend it to anyone.
Maybe before the squad update, but after it, No.
Let it be said here, That the "Devyatayev" Update marks the absolute shitty downfall for H&G

Edit-
Game came out!
Does that matter?
No, still shit.
I somewhat enjoyed this game, a little, simply because it fulfills a kind of niche no other game has filled for me in quite some time, that's probably the only reason I kept playing as long as I did. however this game is also extremely frustrating as it is full of glaring balance issues and has a run away monetization system that absolutely ruins the entire game and any fun you might have had as soon as you reach the 'gold' tier of matchmaking.

Once you get into Gold Tier matchmaking all enjoyment your first ten hours gave you is going to leave instantly unless you are an extremely patient person or really enjoy this type of gameplay, you will from then on be matchmade with people with weapons twice as powerful as your own. People in tanks and planes which you have no good counter to and snipers that can one hit you with a bodyshot which is ridiculous, the rifles should do 99 damage maximum with a headshot needing to score you the one hit kill. This game isn't CoD and a rifle shouldn't one hit kill someone to the torso up to the distances that they do in this game but this is only one of the many glaring balance issues facing new players.

The base weapons when you buy them [b]should not[/b] be half as powerful as the same weapons but with upgrades leaving you at a distinct disadvantage to those who have spent more time in the game than you, or someone who has thrown money at the game. The fact a game with this much potential is being held back by what seems to be blatant greediness by the developer is a real shame. You can really feel a good game under all this somewhere but this game's monetization model absolutely and completely ruins it. If you've ever played Planetside 2 you know what to expect from this game, fork over the cash or be at a disadvantage forever. Actually the thing Planetside 2 has going over this is in Planetside 2 you don't have to pay free credits to repair your weapons, a system that absolutely goes to show just how greedy the devs are.

I'm going to give an example of what you can expect as a free player with no intention to pay money, or if you are someone without access to a means to pay for things.

I saved up to get the Mosin Nagant because I wanted to be a bolt action infantryman as semi-autos are really not to my taste, I buy it only to find it does around 50 damage a shot, thus far it has taken me about 5 hours of gameplay with a lot of matches where I have done insanely well and I still have not unlocked any of the upgrades which increase it's damage meaning I have been stuck playing at a serious disadvantage and at the rate I get the free currency even when I do unlock the upgrade, I will not be able to afford them for quite some time.

I am left using a bolt action rifle with iron sights, that does 50 damage a shot while the majority of others in the game have rifles that kill in one shot to the torso or have semi-automatic rifles that do 75 damage a shot or sub machine guns that mow you down without you having even a remote chance at fighting back.

Oh and the pistols cost a stupidly high amount of the credits so don't think you'll be having a backup sidearm any time soon.

Do not play this game unless you enjoy grinding or are willing to fork over some cash to get onto the level of everyone else.
Well, I gave it a go, and thought maybe, just maybe, the masses of reviews might be wrong, but they're really not.

Basic matchmaking is seemingly a no-go. Pitting low level players with basic gear against characters with top end gear and hours of experience? That seems like a recipe for bland, monotonous gameplay of getting killed over, and over again without a chance. inb4 get good, I know I suck, but at least pit me against other folk who suck, so we can eventually pick up some better skills and not suck.

Also, there's more grinding than any of the Tony Hawks games combined.

tl;dr dont it's bad
I had always wondered about this game when I saw the mostly negative reviews I thought to myself, it can't be THAT bad. Sure enough, it was. There are major issues in the game that are simple fixes but haven't been changed probably because of pure laziness.

This game is nothing more than a cash grab. I understand it's a F2P game and they have to make money some how but the way the game is designed it almost forces you to buy veteran or spend an insane amount of time in game that really no one realistically has. If you don't play a good amount of hours then you are going to be very behind and that will result in a rough matchmaking experience. 

That raises another issue, the matchmaking system. Plain and simple it's just a match maker tool. There is no formula, there is no balance, nothing! 

Huge groups of experienced clans or premades can go up against brand new players with stock guns and they just don't have a chance. And it's not like it happens every so often, it's literally 8 out of 10 games consist of veteran players vs brand new players. In my 50 hours in the game (at the time of writing this review), I'd say about 5 of them were actual close games. The rest were mostly my team stomping new players or my team getting stomped by vets with everything unlocked.

But wait, there's more!
The majority of my games my team would be down in players. I had a TON of games where it would be something like 8 v 12 since the beginning of the game and nothing changes. We don't get team mates, get stomped all game and it's over. And on the flip side the same thing occurs, my team would have 10 players vs like 5-6 and the games aren't even close. Do you see a pattern forming here? 

TL:DR The game is NOT balanced in many different ways (matchmaking, guns, tanks, etc) and will result in a poor matchmaking experience the majority of the games you play unless you either spend money or spend an INSANE amount of time grinding and grinding.
My advice to people considering playing this game: 
[u][h1][b]DON'T (As of June 2016)[/b][/h1][/u]

This game has a lot of potential. 

However, it is ruined by the fact that the game is pay to win. Real life money can buy you just about anything and everything in the game or you could grind for hours for the next gun.

I started playing this game around June-July 2014. It is now June 23, 2016 and the game is still in Beta. Yet, if another developer were to release this game in its current state and removed the microtransactions people would pay good money for it. 

This game is being developed by a bunch of lazy devs. protecting their ass with their "Beta" disclaimer and banking off the fact that as long as people are playing the game, someone won't want to grind for the next gun and will empty their wallet on the game.

[strike]Also, if you want your game to make it anywhere today you have to have at least add toggle aim option.[/strike]

My advice to Reto-Moto: Get off your asses, take the game out of Beta and add some new feautures [strike](like toggle aim, it can't be that hard, every other game under the sun has it, why doesn't yours?). And yes, I know it can be hard to make a game, I understand. But this post from July 2014 says "they talked about adding [toggle aim] earlier..." (Kirby) http://steamcommunity.com/app/227940/discussions/0/41973821259411967/ . It can't possibly take this long to add toggle aim can it?[/strike]

Toggle aim is in fact a part of the game (Thank you Sparkle_Boy). However I still find that this game has too many pay-to-win aspects.

Thank you for your time.
At first, and this was nearly a year ago, the game wasn't too bad. The grind was time consuming, but seemed fair. A few bugs cropped up from time to time but nothing that was knee-jerking. Now... It is just terrible. All the bugs remain, plus a few new ones ( chute not opening on Paratroopers for some reason ). They also doubled the cost of everything since I started playing ( at least for the F2P currency ), making the grind unbearable.

People argue that it isn't Pay 2 Win ( because you CAN earn everything through play ), but I can't see the logic there when now it seems to take as many hours as a part-time job to earn anything. Maybe they earned it all before the devs decided they weren't getting enough revenue. I don't know, but people claim to have played around 300 hours ( odd that this is the number keeps cropping up ) and unlocked everything. Maybe they just meant a single faction, but I can't see 300 hrs unlocking every Class, Weapon, Weapon Mod, Vehicle and Badge for all three factions.

In conclusion, save your time, save your money, save your braincells. Don't play this.
Used to be fun and rewarding but after all the update that give you no profit gain for playing to purchase or modding your gun, insane cost of explosive refill and repair.
When I first started playing this game, it was at a period of time where I was really in to WWII FPS. And because I was a F2P player, my options were pretty limited. When I picked up this game, the initial feeling was that it was awesome, and that it will become to next game I play a lot. Then as I played further, that initial sensation wore off, and I became face to face with the many issues this game has.

1. Getting to the frontline
When you die in this game, you respawn, often very far from the action. You have a few options. One, hope that a teammate also died recently and spawned with a car. Two, have bought a vehicle yourself (which costs quite a bit) and do that. Three, hope that there was a random bicycle or truck by the spawn point. Or four, just take 2-3 minutes walking and running to the front.

2. Economy
When it comes to games that you need to grind, this is one of the biggest examples of it. For a casual player like me, I get around 5,000 credits (or whatever the currency is called) a game, maybe 6-7,000 on a particularly good game. Even though Reto gives you free vouchers on holidays, it doesn't really help too much with the fact that you won't be making too much more money. Considering the fact that there are also repair costs, you won't be making much money per game and will have to grind a lot with a Membership to get anywhere.

3. The New Player Experience
Because I have experience in shooters, starting out with this game was easier than it would be for other people. For one, iron sights on the standard semi-auto rifles are pretty small and thin, and even on high graphic settings, is still hard to see as it blends in with everything you're aiming at. Also, bullets don't go exactly where you aim them so newer players will have a hard time hitting anything. Even when you unlock SMG's, the experience isn't too much better as Veteran players will just kill you over and over. Along with all the other things listed above, this is not a noob-friendly game.

So in conclusion, this is not a game that is really worth your time, and you'd be better off picking up a game for a few bucks rather than play this pile of junk.
Was an awesome game until they decided it was a good idea to push spawns a mile from the captured objective, plus its just world of tanks at this point
The recent Devyatayev update has rendered this game unplayable. I believe I speak on behalf of all tankers, regardless of faction, when I say that we have never seen such a fuck-up come out of Reto's development team since the creation of AT grenades.
Enjoy having to wait 5 minutes to spawn. 
Enjoy spawning on top of spawn-killing landmines. 
Enjoy getting rushed by Allied AT shitheads on motorcycles going way too fast for you to defend yourself. 
Enjoy being an easy target for U.S planes because they can drop 2 bombs in a single succession as opposed to 1 (Thanks Reto)!
Tiger-II most potent tank of World War II MY ASS! The armor system of tanks is literal horseshit. I don't know how I'm supposed to be able to 'take out any other tank on the battlefield beyond 2000 meters with ease' if I can't even penetrate the frontal turret armor of an IS-2 at point blank in my Tiger.

As for the infantry, the U.S and Soviets dominate. M1 Carbine with full auto or AVS with full auto will insta-shit on any German player's gun regardless of the range between the two soldiers. The Americans are full of little 11 year old shitters who cry "Nerf! Nerf!" at anyone who uses their own guns against them or anyone who actually lines up some quality headshots on them with a Gewehr or Kar98. The creators of this game are continuously spewing out new shit for U.S and Soviets and at the same time buffing their already overpowered weapons. The German faction is left out every update but still somehow wins the most battles in every war. But that's okay, because it still says BETA at the top! Right? Since 2013? Right? My advice: Unless you want to join one of the overpowered factions that are America and USSR where it's as easy to get kills that you might aswell hack, don't waste your time or your money on this game until a huge update is released
Made in 3/3/19
In Short:
Do not play this game, nor start to play, nor invest in this game. 

The Development team has consistently ignored the community on improvements or changes as well as are inept and lazy to develop or create anything out of the game that used to have so much potential, and has made this another addition to the many DayZ Standalones and Poorly Developed Games that people have wasted time in. 

In Long:
As a person who has played this game 1515 Hours in Match Time, I cannot recommend you this game to play, even if its a Free to Play Video Game. 

Majority of the Reviews in support of this game has been made years prior when the game was still in Alpha/Beta where there was a good chunk of hope by the community that the Devs (Reto Moto) would improve and coordinate with the community on improving the game.

I can say by the end of 2018, Reto Moto has proven to be inept in this, and have instead taken to a route of creating a System in which they attempt to profit off the community at large, and take little to none input from the community, the last of which was a PR Stunt of bringing up Community leaders to discuss at their Offices, which brought little to none change (Reto:Insider) 

The gameplay you would find, is one of grinding in order to play outside of your own spawn, in which you start against AI but then are thrown into matchmaking which pitches you against end rank players with fully modded automated SMGs, ARs, and MGs, while you are stuck with a barely modded gun and little to no income per match. 

You are also thrown into a game in which the team can at any time switch from infantry to pilots or other tanks, making you the only one on the objective as snipers, infantry with Fully modded guns and other tanks with HE shells go against you. So if you die, you get spawn camped over and over again and you proceed to lose the match.

This is also not mentioning the fact due to Reto:Moto's inept development of the game, the majority of the Community in the North America Time Zone/Servers have quit, so if you are a NA player you are likely to get stuck into a match of EU or South American Ping, at 100~200. 

You are also met with a massive time in which in order to not be killed instantly against enemy snipers who have a fully modded one hit kill gun and a 8x scope, you need to grind for about 10hrs of match time just walking. That isn't a over exaggeration, players tend to only get their Heavy Set Gold (A buff that you can select to reduce damage taken, to prevent you from being one shot) by walking for hours in match time in order to grind the level needed to reach said perk. This also assumes you survive walking from spawn to the objective, in which majority of the maps have large open grounds for snipers, tanks and planes to shoot and kill you.

There are many other grievences against this game I could list, but in short this game is a poor attempt to waste your time, your money and your life due to the inept actions of the developers at large to develop a game with the community in hand, rather, releasing cosmetic skins to vehicles and guns, and adding large price tag vehicles and level changes to make you spend either hours of gameplay to grind and maintain, or actual currency to buy.

This game, and the company who developed it is a scam. And as a Vet from the beginning, its a sham of what it could have been. Very few people who used to make youtube videos on this game do anymore due to it's direction, and even fewer stream it, for a good reason. 

Save your time. Dont download.
I tried playing this game again after years away because it's a great concept with amazing game mechanics and has the *potential* to be a great game...except the developer decided to turn it into a pay2win scam. Normal progression is so painfully slow, it's not even worth it, and with the low player count now, it makes the pay2win players more matched up with the rest of us peasants.

Bottom line: if you're not willing to pay through the nose, don't expect anything other than being cannon fodder for rich guys with nice tanks, guns, and planes. Too bad, this game had a lot of potential.
I loved this game, played it for a few years, invested a lot of time and even some money in it. But update after update the devs destroyed what made it great (like the freedom to change roles during a battle). Now with the new "Devyatayev" Update they turned it into a complete piece of c***. I sincerely hope they will learn to listen to the players (but censorship seems to be the way they walk). If not they'll make me regret that i ever invested anything into their game. Peace to all the great players i've played with during those golden years. RIP HNG.
Only worth it if you want to drop a'lot of money, why do developers not understand that attracting more people to play your game, so much so that you can continue a franchise or expansion purchases, instead of racking the game with small in game purchases, would net them more money?

Are they purposely trying to bankrupt themselves?
"Free to Play" but not "Free to Enjoy." 

If you don't open your wallet up like Eva Braun did her legs, you're basically playing as a dude with muscular dystrophy whomst is armed with a fucking Nerf gun. And don't even talk to me about the vehicles. Did you get this game because you wanted a tank-- or God forbid an airplane? Go fuck yourself. Just go fuck yourself. You'll have a better time doing that than even attempting to grind out a usable vehicle.

The whole thing is fucked sideways. Don't waste your time. You're better off with Fortnite and I've heard that's a fate worse than Auschwitz.

Seriously, go to coolmathgames. Frankly, Runescape is a better WWII experience than this hot pile of garbage.
Biggest f*ckin trash i've ever played with.

REPAIRING STUFF (THE MOST ANNOYING SH*T IN THE GAME):
Every goddamn item you have, weapons, vehicles, gadgets, even your fucking ammo needs repairs. (AMMO F*CKING AMMO)
For example: You buy a grenade for 20k (yes im serious), you use it for one match, then it literally deterioates and you have to repair it if you want to keep its HP up, if you are lucky or you had a good round, the MOST amount of credits you can get is 8k, IF you dont have veteran membership of course, if you do its 10k.....oh and a completely deterioated grenade needs 9000 credits to repair. So basically if you had a sh*t match, you literally have no money to repair your goddamn grenades, but if you do then literally 95% of your earnings go to f*cking repairs.

And remember you have to repair EVERYTHING, your weapon, your vehicles, your gadges etc....
Even if some items dont require that mutch credit, half of your earnings from a match goes for goddamn repairs.
Keep in mind you have multiple classes, tanker.....his tanks needs repairs, infantry has stuff that needs repairs too, recon needs repairs too etc....etc.....you have multiple classes you can use on the battlefield, all of em need repairs after every match C-O-N-S-T-A-N-T-L-Y.
This piece of sh*t mechanic got built in for only one reason, to drive you crazy and force you to buy veteran membership or gold with real money. Why force someone to grind harder when its already hard enough.....TRASH.

CLASSES:
There is the Infantry, your standard soldier....costs 9000 credits, the only fair price in the whole game for a class if you ask me.

PARATROOPER:
 Literally the same as goddamn Infantry, it has the same weapons the same gadgets the same everything, the only difference is that he can jump out of planes to land on objectives, but he has limited inventory which means you can only bring a gun, nothing else...no gadgets, no sidearm no nothing, the only thing you get is ONE EXCLUSIVE weapon for the class.
And if there is no available plane for you to spawn, YOU SPAWN ON THE GROUND LIKE A REGULAR INFANTRY, or you jump out and right before you could land an enemy soldier shoots you down.....or an AA gun does the same, or your plane gets destroyed by an AA gun, it doesn't matter its just sh*t trust me.
Even a regular infantry can get back into action with its vehicles, it has way bigger inventory for gadgets and weapons, and i repeat it has the SAME GODDAMN WEAPONS.
Oh and did i mention this sh*t costs 71k credits?

RECON CLASS
Once again the recon has the same WEAPONS AS INFANTRY.....a goddamn Karabiner rifle with a scope.
The infantry has the same Karabiner rifle, and you can attach a scope to that aswell.
The only difference Recon has that his scopes are more magnified, you can add more mods than the infantry, it has ONE exclusive vehicle you never going to use.
You are never going to use that "more" magnified scope unless you plan to camp in a bush whole match, and infantry have scopes too on the same weapon, and the modding on the Recon's rifle is not that different from the Infantry at all, its almost non-existent, and dont get me started on that "class-exclusive vehicle", just dont bother its sh*t....the infantry has a wider choice of vehicles than Recon. And while the Recon can only use Sniper and a pistol as sidearm, the Infantry can have the same weapons as Recon, including pistol and rifle, plus he has smg's, assault rifle's, lmg's, gadgets etc.
And still the Recon costs 208k credits, wow.

THE TANKER:
Finally a class that is unique for once and not copy paste sh*t, with its vehicles and gadgets for the tanks such as a wrench for (REPAIRING AGAIN LMAO) but this time its in-game repairing not the credit type......oh not so fast, the wrench deterioates too so you have to repair that aswell with credits, A LOT OF CREDITS.
Oh dont worry this shit class have flaws too, first of all lets say you grinded 120k credits because thats how mutch the class costs.
Then you go into a match only to realise your FIRST EVER TANK that came with the class has NO CANNONS, which means you only have shi**y machine guns, you cannot damage enemy tanks at all with that, you can only shoot infantry.
And here comes the best part, if you want to unlock other tanks, you have to get xp for a ribbon that unlocks other tanks and level it up, but you only get xp for that ribbon by damaging other tanks WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE.
So all you can do is shoot other tanks with your machine gun and get xp for the ribbon that way, but you are not going to deal damage to them at all because an mg is useless against a tank's armor, all you do is farm xp, then they blow you up every time, then you respawn, and so on. You are basically defenseless until you farm enough xp and unlock a new tank.
And no, you cannot kill infantry with a tank and gain xp that way, you only get xp to that ribbon by shooting armor, thats the only way to unlock new tanks......f*ck logic.
Talking about tanks, i bought the Tanker from the German faction and i can guarantee the tank balance in this game is f*cking pathetic between factions.
It didn't matter which tank i unlock, which one i buy or go with, everytime i met a more expensive tank from another faction or just a more expensive tank in general, i lost the fight all the time, even when i was the one suprising them.....even after a volley of shots they slowly turn around and f*ck you up like you tickled them, if you have cheaper tank from the same category as theirs or from another category, YOU LOSE.
The most expensive tank is the most OP in every situation no skill involved, the tanks dont counter each other from different categories, nothing like that, money wins.
And dont get me started on the prices either. 400k-300k-200k each IF you want a good tank that can barely fight with the expensive ones, if you want cheap go for the 60k or 150k ones, but dont expect to win at all.

The only class i didn't play with is the Pilot, but if you did not notice already, im guessing its the same as every other class, overpriced class with overpriced vehicles, and no fun and fair playing with starter gear.

I unlocked the General the last "something" i cant really call a class......guess how mutch it costs.
2 MILLION CREDITS, no thanks.
From the videos i saw about this class the only thing you can do is send troops on a map, buy troops with warfunds (which is another currency) and thats it.....its an RTS game where you watch your ordered troops which are highlighted as pathetic squares on the map moving to territory from territory, you can resupply your fighting troops on the war map and THATS IT....THATS IT FOR 2MILLION CREDITS.....THAAAAATS IT

UNBALANCE BETWEEN FACTIONS, FACTION WEAPONS, VEHICLES ETC...:
Everything the vehicles, the weapons, United States Faction has the most OP tanks next to the pathetic list of weak tanks in the German Faction, even the Russian tanks are more powerful.
The weapons between factions, one faction got the trash ones while one has the most OP ones
The whole thing is just a mess and it really all comes down to who has the more OP gear.
There are no counters, weak points, differences in who's better in what NOTHING.
Someone has the sh*t, someone has the good, thats it.

Just go play the game, lvl up your profile to the War game mode, and you'll see what i mean.
The germans are nonstop losing because how OP the Americans and Russians are. Better gear, better weapons, better vehicles, better everything.

If one faction starts to pound another into the ground nonstop in a gamemode that literally revolves around the whole game, is there really any balance in the game? I dont think so, War mode is literally the definition of "unbalanced" if you dont have enough recources on your faction because the player generals are not willing to send in any, and their general did, you lose. So you basically lose and you have to accept it, because you cant do anything about it....
This game was such a let down. Everything about this game is pay to win. The worst part is, this game had so much potential. The only way to fix it is a massive overhaul to the economy. Get more money per game, lower the prices of soldiers, vehicles, and equipment.  Having a long and frustrating grind is one thing, but having to grind and pay for basic equipment like grenades, secondaries, and attachments is just stealing. Everything is designed around paying to git gud. This is most evident with the sniper class. It is the most expensive class to purchase, because it is the most overpowered class. The sniper rifle is a one shot kill. Automatics are super expensive and you start off with nothing but a semi-auto. So get prepared to get fucked because someone either grinded for hours on end to get, or just used their wallet. I'm honestly suprised this game doesn't have a lower score. Don't drop a single penny on this game, and don't waste your hours playing it.
ive played 65 hours of H&G and the gameplay is great somwhat realistic. But my biggest down fall is the ingame currency. It takes far to long to get any money stacked to purchase anything good. i feel they need to increase the hourly rate all it seems is a grind grind grind and the 65 hours ive put in doesnt show very much other than account level an 1 actual hero level. This game is too much time consuming to a casual gamer an the game doesnt have much to actually be competive compared to most free shooters on the market. so overall due to the past year or 2 and the devs not willing to push for a increase in money to be made an more willing to allow Real currency to control the game i will have to put a thumbs down until i and many others see an increase that matches putting real money into the game.
wtf happened to this game?
Why did you make the iron sights so tiny that you can't aim anymore? Why make the bolt action rifles so weak? I had to shoot a guy 3 times up close with the bolt action to kill him....

no thanks,
its pay to win, unless you want to spend hours and hours to get new weapons

i would recommend it if you're bored but there are much better games you could get
I'd rather bite off my dick than play this trash. 

24/7 Grind,unless you pay the money

A great idea of fps shooter that was ruined by greedy developers that dont give a single fuck about their game and players.

0/10,Would like to see the game uninstalling itself from my computer again.

Awful P2W model. Takes forever to grind new gear. Wouldn't be as large of an issue if you weren't fighting an uphill battle against players who pay for straight-up better gear. Whatever fun there is to be had is quickly diminished by the atrociously implemented P2W model. There's a difference between providing a free but limited experience for users that don't pay, and providing a disadvantageous experience for users that don't pay.
Intriguing concept, poor execution. Nowadays it's just like any Battlefield whatever game, the other half of the game has been utterly broken for several years. The FPS part is enjoyable and I recommend it overall, but as I said, that's just half of the game.

Fixes that should have come years ago still haven't arrived, new problems have been created instead.
The developers' idea of fixing stuff is choosing one problem out of a thousand and every year fix 0.000001% of it, and then a few years later make the problem worse by 100%, totally cancelling out any fixes they may have done.

Forums are constantly being cleaned of topics/replies the devs don't want to see, topics are also locked whenever the devs/mods please. Continuing in the same discussion after lock means ban.

After about 5 years I've spent following the game, I'm certain things are not going to be better anytime soon, if ever. If you're hoping for it, that's your gamble, let's see how many years you will spend before you realise the same.

Would I recommend the game 5 years ago? Yes. Do I recommend it now? Absolutely not. The very core, the heart of the game was lost somewhere along the way, or perhaps got buried within the current bloated version of the game. And with noone willing to reflect the community's ideas, restore the game back to what it once was and improve from there, all hope is lost.
Developers please do something about this.
Please read the full thing and please reply.

As you can see, I have quite a lot of hours played in this game. I'm finally ready to write a review.
I love the game, but there are many downsides to it. The US faction are too overpowered, Germany has been nerfed to oblivion, war is unbalanced and M1919 needs a nerf.

I just finished a game of encounter, and we are versing Americans. Most of them have the M1919, thompson and other weapons. They are too overpowered, like I was saying. I am not asking to be in favour of Germany, but I am just asking for all factions to be balanced.

War: War is too unfair, when I mean unfair I mean UNFAIR. The Americans are always winning the war. They've won more than 10 consecutive times already. I'm not the only one who feels about this situation. Many people are complaining just like me. We need it to be balanced, just please, please, make it balanced. It looks bad on you and your development of the game.

I would like to specifically say that the M1919 is just annoying, zero recoil, It really need's a nerf. It's up to the point that every American want's it because it is overpowered, it's being abused right now.

We, Germany, really need's balance to our game play, everyone thinks we are treated unequally and we are.
I don't know about Russia, but they are going better than us at the moment.

American tanks are OP. I was playing tanker today and I was faced up against another tank. I shot the tank 10 times at the gun barrel! And yet it wasn't destroyed, nope nothing was destroyed. You can't destroy them.

I use the MG42 and I feel like it's balanced, but what I don't get is, when I am up close against and infantryman, with an M1G. I still can't to kill them with hip fire???

Matchmaking: During matchmaking I get put into 300-600 ping servers, I would like to know also.

That's all for now, and I would very like a reply and a patch about these subjects I've talked about, thank you.
This game is good if you have ton of time to spend on it or just...buy ur self the best gear??? Yeah, this game can be great but I feel a strong "pay to win" element in it. How should I gain XP and some good amount of credit when I just face enemies what are way better geared up and have the best guns and all the things around it. The system with tanks. What is that? Not to mention that I face tanks I can't penetrate but they do easily knock me out. So, when I can't take down tanks and infantry takes me out easily too. How in the living hell should I gain XP for a better tank?! Intotal this game is unbalanced. I may have only 94 hours but I think I have seen enough through the BETA and now the full release. Before the game was better. But even then the element of pay to win was there. I enjoyed this game a lot back then but now? Sadly "me" trying to play this game without putting money in this is a huge pain in the ass. I bealive there are more people who just want to enjoy a good free to play WW2 game. Well sadly we can't. I hoped this game is going to end up somewhere better then in this spot.
I will echo the sentiments said by others. Ever since they made the mechanics and aiming more cartoonish with hit markers and the like, the game has gone way down hill. It was better before the new repair mechanics too but that was passible. I used to love this game, I have spent very nearly 650 hours in this game and spent over $100 yet I cant see myself returning with the poor implementation of the new mechanics and the weaning player base.
I loved this game when I started to play it, LOVED IT. But this piece of shit game is P2W. It takes a long time to grind, having a good gun shooting some enemy soldiers, and the repair cost is about 2k-4k credits, or 18k repair cost. This repair feature needs to be fixed,  also the biggest thing I wanted Reto to fix is the damn optimization...

Goddamn this game is laggy af, after I turning on Spotify listening some music, suddenly it goes to 15 fps. Can you even imagine to play a game which the game can be running on high end pc but still has low fps? This is ridiculous. Reto isn't listenning to us, they adding those crappy features that they can ruin this game easily.

I'll get back to this game until you fix this damn optimization or make grind a lot of easier and quicker. 4/10.
Sorry, but you deserved it.. I loved this game...
So my experiance with this game is weird, I was god teir in my first match getting like 8 kills per life but after that I noticed some patterns. The player base tends torwards what I like to call "not on the same team" syndrome where they demand over chat that the entire team moves in a way that helps them, but not the team as a whole. The pilots are the worst offenders of this. Also I play as the Americans because patriotism, and by god do they need buffs. I looked at stats comparing the guns from germany and america and holy crap, the fact I was able to win any gunfights astounds me. The tank crewmen are hit the worst because america has tanks that are great against russian, but will bounce off medium german tanks. Also the map deign is terrible and lends to spawn camping. Sniping is impossible due to the poor resolution making it better off you go without one. In short, this game is an unbalanced dumpster fire that has gotten to everyone that plays it.
What could have been a good Free to Play Game is destroyed by developers who do not care about their community.
This game does not let you progress in any meaningful way through gameplay. you need to repair weapons and restock ammunitions, which in the end makes the unlocking of other weapons impossible. 
Kinda Sad. it is a cheap cash grab by greedy developers who do not understand how a free to play game makes profit.
There are not that many players, and it's no surprise since the game sucks.

Cons:
-Full of spawn killers
-Just too much shit everywhere, is this made for some kids who have ADD?
-Guns are terrible
-You have to pay if you want to unlock basically anything, or play 990000000000h to get enouch points to buy shit
-Same goes to differen't classes, so if you want to try flying you need to pay or play the game forever.
-Starts to repeat itself reeeaaally fast

Pros:
-At first it seemed like an OK ww2 shooter

Grade: Shit / 5
Don't waste your time
What an amazing game.... NOT. 

No balance what so ever. You have 1 weapon at start.

+ Runs REALLY bad on my PC (i7-4770, GTX 1070, 16 GB of RAM)... well not that bad, but not great either for such game. ~60 FPS
Have to admit did not play this game very long as it could not find a battle  - so have deleted it.    Recommend not going through the hassle of downloading it, setting up a player and then learning how to play.

Not worth the effort.
never again.
had one account for each faction to keep them seperated.
never did bad stuff and grinded like there is no tomorrow.
played since 2014.
the devs didn´t like me,so they banned me from the forums and 2 out of my 3 accounts ingame(for a really bogus reason that never been a problem).
if you treat you veterans like this your game is doomed. no way to clear things up and just blocking.and no way to reach the right guy to talk to (guess his beta-male mode kicked in full throttle,lol)
so, if you always say yes and like to have a brown neck-go play this game.
if you want a good support,good updates and devs that listen to their playerbase-go play something else.
you can´t be someone who critiques the devs...you´ll get banned. and you´ll get bored waiting for updates they promised for 2017...that are still "in the pipelines" in 2019...
plus the games is crooked and the rts part is dead.
don´t waste your time and go play something fun.
heck even electronic aids bfV is better and more fun,plus they really fix stuff...in time...

tl;dr -> geem is ded nao, devs give a loving shirt about playerbase,waste of time.
Has been a decent game until late 2017/early 2018...

Reto definately has decent skills developing bad concepts, ignoring the needs and ideas of the community.

Now - in 2019 - you can say its a mess, heaps of bad choices have eventually ruined this game. Player numbers dropped significanty and i can't blame those people at all.

not even worth a Free2play game.

RIP.
This game is BROKEN.

DO NOT GET THIS GAME.

It is overrun with people who somehow 1 shot you from behind walls, hills, etc, 
It's IMPOSSIBLE to kill an enemy, COMPLETELY disastrous with a starter tank, 
And none of the devs nerfed the Russian Bias, tanks like SU85B have TOO MUCH armor. When you get a tank crew member for the first time, it's just, "Damaged front armor, +1 xp" and STILL not a kill after you reload about 30 times.
And worst of all, they put spawns HALF A MILE away, even if you die AGAIN, respawn, and FINALLY get the hell back to where you WERE, you'd just get 1shotted AGAIN unfairly, this torment is endless.
FUCK THIS GAME, THE GAME CANNOT ALLOWED ME TO CHANGE RESOLUTION, FUCK THIS GAME, DONT PLAY THIS PIECE OF SHIT GAME, YUR TRASHHHHHHH, FIX THE GAME YOU FUCKING DEAD GAME

Prices are outragious. spend $5000 or buy battlefield for $50
You can't get very far into the game without spending serious money unless you spend 168 hours a week playing.
Fuck load of bots too. You would think with all the money they charge they would invest in some security but no always some one 50:3 winning games.
• Enemy pilots will destroy paratrooper planes as soon as the paratrooper planes spawn in. And so paratroopers will just continuously die over and over again.

• High-level players have way better guns then newer players, and so newer players will just get annihilated all of the time.

• The worst problem with this game is the recon troopers. Their guns one-shot kill on TORSO SHOTS. And so literally anyone who is a recon gets an insane amount of kills because of how easy it is. (Seriously, how did none of the developers see this as a problem? Headshots should instant kill, not torso shots. Because torso shots are the easiest things to hit on a player).

• Matchmaking can take a very long time to get into a game.
Takes longer to find a game than it takes to join a lobby in GTA Online. 
(which is very long) 
i ran into a lot of hackers, headshotting me with starting weapon from across the map, it just doesn't add up.
i recommend you all to save up some money and buy another game.
I download this every now and then, put it down after maybe 3 rounds. For me, I can't get into the game with the starting gear being pretty poor and just how the game looks and feels. It has great game play and a solid flow but it just feels more like a browser game (Which it used to be) and thats not really for me.
Terrible game, even in its full release the game is unoptimized, bullshit hit detection, connection problems, and hackers.
Most weapons and items are a pain in the ass to get because you gotta grind to get the money to buy said weapons and items , i wouldn't mind if the game was fun.

This game sience its beta has been a clusterfuck of a game, and its full release only fixed small issues and not the game itself.
Avoid this game, there are better free to play games out there
This game is trash, it used to be an ok game but the new mechanics for tanks,planes,cars,ect. are trash. most tanks have practically infinite health. In tank vs. tank combat you can fire 10 shots and not kill a 1937 tank with 30mm of armor with a 37mm pak gun with ap rounds. suiciding tanks with anti-tank granades is 99999999x more effective and easier. The movment is tarsh and feels like a bad tambased shooter, the starter guns are trash and the new players are forced to fight people with smgs, lmgs, and STG44s. I've wasted 150hours of my life and round 20$ on this trash game. If you want a ww2 game play post scriptum. 

0/10 the devs don't want to fix their broken game
As much as I would love to like this game I just can't. H&G try so many interesting concepts but they never land. Time and time again you'll just die to tanks because the game allows a shit ton of them. The shooting mechanics are very hard to get down as every gun has a major sway so headshots seem almost based on luck rather than skill. For new players the game is very hard to get into since it allows you to play on more servers the more you play. So basically, The longer you play the faster it is to get in a game. There are clear and obvious metas in the game to get more kills and it all ends up being boring doing the same thing every game. It's a great game in concept bad in execution.
Let me get this straight, for a free game this is good. However there are just so many problems it really turns onto the page of having to pay me to play this game. There aren't many bugs but that problem is smashed out of the park when compared to the amount of broken balancing and horrid map design.

 Lets get the balancing out of the way, originally the Germans had the most OP guns until they nerfed them all into oblivion. However only did minor tweaks to Russian and US guns, giving the Russians the most OP gun of them all and has been in the running for years, the AVS. The Americans don't have that much of OP weaponry however their weapons smash the German's compared to how cheap their good weapons are. such as the grease gun being just as powerful as the MP40, which is triple the times of the cost. Now out of weaponry, the vehicles are really unbalanced where is gave the Russians a car that is more like a tank, The US and Russians a motorbike that is more like Sonic on Cocaine, and the US tanks that have enough health as a Dark Souls Boss and has the power to split the earth in two. Some of the German tanks are balanced and the others are as scary as marshmellows because of their damage being close to a BB-Gun. 

Now onto the map designs, O-baby are they bad. Honestly, the hit-boxes for some items on the map are as big as your mother. Along with the placement of doors being a joke and always one sided, mostly you can tell if the Attackers or Defenders are going to win just by the map alone. Some areas are as cluttered as your room and the rest of the map is a barren wasteland were you wonder if the Minutemen are going to ask for your help. All of these maps are a sniper's wet dream, so much so that they doubled the cost of being a sniper compared to being a fucking tank commander!   
Not to mention every map is not vehicle friendly, the placement of everything makes it really hard not to go offroad, due to every road leading to a checkpoint that is blocked off by hedgehogs and sandbags. Also if you drive offroad your speed gets so slow that the enemy could run up to you and bonk you on the head with a shovel. So the use of tanks are pretty much just snipers with a 50BMG and having the size of once again your mother.

I do like this game and will continue to play it but I will never recommend it until all weaponry and vehicles are balanced and the maps are fixed so they don't look like they were designed by a blind autistic kid that can't walk.
Game is very buggy. With new updates you cannot change soldiers class. Pay to win. If you dream of sniper rifle, heavy tank, plane or anything good be prepared that you spend many (hundreds) hours grinding. To show you, look at this simple math: A soldier rank 6 earns 10 500 credits/h. If you would like to buy recon, than you have to earn almost 210 000 credits. So you thought, that you'll have it in 20 hours? HA! WRONG! So now let me show you real math of this game. Let's say you've been in war match for 30 minutes. You're a big boy now and have soldier rank 10, who makes 12 000 per hour. Now with all the bonuses you've made 9 000 credits, awesome right... BUT, You forgot to pay for maintenance. Well now you're 6 500 credits lighter. Well you could have earned 12 000 credits with veteran status only for 2€ per day, 8€ per 14 days, 11€ per month or 20€ for 90 days! And that's not all... You'll get more slots, soldier upgrades and XP BOOST! So there you have it, if you don't pay for premium you barely make profit and advance very slowly.
Conclusion first:
Give it a try but don't invest money on it!

Playing this every now and then since it is F2P and the FPS market doesn't have any decent games which are any good in comparison to their budget, at least I think like that. However this game can be fun at times but most of the time it is more frustrating due to various things and although the idea of some parts of the game is quite good, the practical point of view is a different one in that regard.

A short summary about Pros and Cons.

Pros
+ F2P
+ relatively low hardware requirements
+ good game idea

+- sort of physics
+- weapon enhancements

-Cons
- No tutorial
- No tutorial
- No tutorial
- No tutorial
- War mode is in favour of 1 faction
- Weapon balance is in favour of 1 faction for the most part
- Vehicle balance is in favour of 1 faction
- Developers don't play their own game
- game is instable (servers and client) and very slow (welcome year 1990)

The grind is acceptable for me at least as even if you get let's say upgrades for your weapon you will not use them as it is usually to expensive to run, or you simply don't need them because of the weapon is already good or superior to other weapons.


This game has no tutorial ingame, which explains how WAR works, game mechanics, physics, vehicles, tactical stuff and so on. Imo this is needed and I don't know why I need to request something like this nowadays, it should be a go to right way.

Physics are nice, but they need a lot of fine tuning to make it work in this game which also goes for weapon upgrades/ enhancements. They are not paying off very well.
Updates contain some content, but as we seen with the latest anti tank rifles, they are useless and expensive, or the armor update is not well thought through ( are they even testing or playing their own game? ). Game crashes often when you are on the Generals map, or also when you want to a join a specific battle the game crashes you and starts the map on a different server for you with a bad ping.

Overall this game is not worth your time
Installed,Started it up,Got on the main page and customized soldier, Clicked start game... AND IT DOESENT START A GAME ive tried multiple times of uninstalling and reinstalling but nothing works and i played this game just fine a long time ago but now it doesent want to work Final verdict: Do not recommend it, doesen't even play and not worth the waste of time trying to get it to work
More of a plea to other devs, Can you guys make a game like this but without a grind system that literally takes you days to get anything near a good rifle? Game is fun and all...But it is unbalanced as all hell and the developers refuse to listen or do anything to fix it. They literally told one guy to 'Get good' and to stop complaining. I'd say go to hell  RETO MOTO. It may have been a shoddy grind system a year or two ago but at least the game was fun.
