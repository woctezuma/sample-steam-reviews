Free to play, without constantly being bugged with microtransactions. Overall it is a solid game, and with the number of gods it takes quite a bit of time to really learn how their abilities can work together. I would consider this game relatively easy to pick up and play but it will take you some time to really master the finer details. Give it a shot, its free and if you happen to hate it you can just delete it.
Fun MOBA

3rd person perspective makes games feel faster paced and more action heavy

Played since beta

Difficulty curve is not too steep

Community is only moderately toxic

Ultimate god pack is probably best value in any MOBA

Update: Game was having issues running through steam, uninstalled and run directly through hi-rez client which makes it work better. No idea if it is steam's fault or my hardware. 

I wrote the review 2 years ago, lots of game updates since then, overall experience hasn't changed much although the community has definitely become slightly more than moderately toxic.

Also the ultimate god pack is still the best value in MOBAs but if you disagree please let me know.
SMITE is a fantastic game that takes the MOBA genre into a 3rd-person perspective; allowing me to implement the aiming, timing and skills I've gained from playing other games, like shooters, but with a stronger emphasis on strategy and team building-- making the combat fast and highly addictive. 

Compared with League of Legends and Dota 2, it relies less on builds and the minions/creeps, but without removing those elements of strategy either. Rather than losing an integral part of what makes other MOBAs enjoyable and meaty, it replaces them with what gives games like first-person and third-person shooters depth. It panders to and compliments a different style, giving a different experience but in a familiar format. 

Minions aren't as relevant late game as they are in Dota, but it feels right. You're playing the role of a god, and by the time you're at end-game, you have bigger threats to worry about-- other gods. It's satisfying to build a tank that 5 enemy gods and a tower, all at once, can't easily kill. It feels great to have your team expect you to clutch, but succumb to the pressure and miss all your shots. I love saving a teammate at the last possible moment by landing a perfectly aimed and timed kiss from Aphrodite, which stun locks the enemy. 

It's about timing, weaving in and out of battle, aim and speed. Team fights are intense and replicate the rush you'd expect from a competitive shooter, all while respecting the governing outline of a MOBA. That makes SMITE a truly unique experience.

Most people who claim SMITE "sucks", play LoL or Dota. They see other games within the same genre as direct competition to the game they love. They don't care about enjoying games for what they offer; they compare and contrast simply to feel like they’re part of a team—for the sake of ego. It’s as though they themselves had a hand in the game development; they're very, very proud.

Most of them like to say SMITE’s not as deep. I argue the opposite. I feel where it lets go in micromanaging, it substitutes with a skill-oriented, high speed combat experience. It has depth and develops a skillset absent from other MOBAs. So it comes down to misunderstanding the skills necessary in SMITE. 

I've been playing SMITE for probably a year now. I should have at least 300 hours, perhaps more. I wish my friends would play with me, but most of them have 'standards' and strongly draw the line after LoL. They’re better than Smite, and If I want to play with them, I’m going to have to play their favorite MOBA. 

It would enhance my experience to play with them on SMITE, but even without a single friend, this game has kept my attention and I'll continue to play it.

Moreover, SMITE is constantly evolving. New skins, new gods, new maps, redesigns, new items, nerfs, buffs, new UI, etc. In the short amount of time I've played the game, I've seen many drastic changes. If you tried Smite years ago, it’s a promise that this SMITE is a completely different game today-- by this time next year, it'll have drastically changed again. All these changes are enhancements and true refinements to the game. It continues to get better and better, and HiRez listens to the players. 

SMITE literally looks different graphically and the devs aren't scared to try some pretty wacky shit to make things more fun but balanced.

Free to play; pay to look cool. Smite's become one of my favorite games of all time.　

Note: I play LoL, Dota and Heroes of The Storm as well.

Smite's unique camera angle alone is enough to set it apart from other MOBAs, and developer Hi-Rez didn't stop there. Each map is polished, every God looks and sounds great, and exceptional Match of the Day modes offer plenty of variety. Some late-game balance issues aside, Smite’s divine execution of innovative ideas make it a worthy contender.

[b][h1]Overall - ★★★★★[/h1][/b]
I think it's about time I finally review this game.

I've had a history with this game. I've played this game since Isis was released, which was over 2 years ago. I remember that I was a HUGE fan of the old Sun Wukong (Hun Batz nowadays) and enjoyed the game, although I never got hooked into it. I eventually just stopped playing and went to get addicted to other games, namely Team Fortress 2. Fast foward to 2015, where SMITE is finally released on Steam. I was very curious to give this another try, so I did. Now, before I continue, I have something to say. All of my good friends know this fact well, and I HEAVILY emphasize this:

[b]I hate MOBA games.[/b]

Long story with that, but I just never liked them, besides Awesomenauts. I downloaded SMITE and gave it a second chance, figuring it might be pretty cool now. Okay, this is the part where you look at the number of hours I have in the game. Just take a nice, solid look at it. To the review!

[h1]Graphics[/h1]

MOBAs aren't known to have god-tier graphics (heh) and SMITE is no exception. The game is just... eh. It's sort of bland, but at the same time it actually looks really nice in some places, like Siege and Conquest. Not much to say here, but this is not a game for the photographers out there like myself.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]

The big question to this is, "Is SMITE a good enough MOBA to compare with LoL and DOTA?" The answer to that question is, well, yes! I find it much better to BE the character your playing as, rather than telling them what to do. It's what makes SMITE stand out from the rest of the crowd, and it shines brightly in this way. I don't want to start a flame war, but although it is very simple to understand, the game is much more difficult to master because of the fact you have to actually LAND your shots. No more "clicky-clicky here's the part where 3 champions die" or whatever. Your abilities matter, and missing one could change the course of a game. Plus, of course, teamwork is important in Conquest, and I haven't actually encountered many "OP" gods, if any at all. Some items are clearly better than others *cough* bluestone pendant *cough* *cough* but most aren't too severe. Overall, SMITE delivers with the gameplay by miles.

[h1]Story[/h1]

Just like whether or not Set will be added to the game, there is no known story. This will not be counted towards the final score.

[h1]Audio[/h1]

The audio isn't all that special, but the some of the voice packs you can purchase for gods are actually really funny. Some of the writing is extremely clever and gives the game a LOT of personality.

[h1]Replayability[/h1]

Compared to DOTA and LoL, this game is much easier to pick up and play, although still being a very competitive game. The community, although not sunshine and rainbows, is much easier to deal with and far friendlier than those other toxic wastes of "communities." The gameplay, as said earlier, is simple and it doesn't require too much experience to understand, however I would recommend staying away from Conquest in that case. There are also daily rewards, but I don't like the fact that the prizes don't get increasingly better after 7 days, because it doesn't feel right getting 75 Favor for playing 8 days of SMITE. Invest the time, however, and it'll greatly pay off. Trust me on that.

[h1]Verdict[/h1]

In the end, SMITE gives me a much better point of view on MOBAs, my least favorite genre of gaming. I can easily recommend this game if you don't want to go through a brutal experience like DOTA and LoL, and the fact that it brings out its differences with pride makes it one of the most enjoyable and addictive games I've played since Team Fortress 2. 

[b]Graphics[/b] - 6.5/10
[b]Gameplay[/b] - 9.5/10
[b]Story[/b] - NONE
[b]Audio[/b] - 8.5/10
[b]Replayability[/b] - 9.0/10

[b]**[u]PERSONAL PICK[/u]**[/b]

[b].:8.5/10:.[/b]

+Unique third person view
+Friendly community (mostly)
+Skins & voice packs give the gods charm
+Simple to learn, truly hard to master
+References galore!

-Bland graphics
-Daily rewards needs small improvement
-Audio (aside from voice packs) isn't very memorable
Amazing game. 

I always hated MOBAs until Smite. The 3rd person mechanic is amazing and so much more immersive.

Big fan of mythology so I love all the characters. 

With the contant updates the game is getting better.
Note: I have 1000+ hours pre-steam.

If you've got the stomach for objective based multiplayer deathmatch, you should give this a try. For those familiar with MOBAs the structure of the game will be familiar. But for those that don't know, two teams of 5 try to push across a field to each others base, breaking defensive towers on the way, trying to stay alive and make the enemy die. There are other game modes but they mostly sit as variations on this theme.

What really sets SMITE apart is the way you control your hero. Rather than the awkward click to move and attack system of other MOBAs you move with WASD, and aim your attacks as you would in a shooter, with your mouse. In SMITE 99% of the attacks are skillshots. Dodging is a real tactic, and you do it by moving, not submitting a request to move via your mouse cursor. There are more than enough characters for you to find several you're excited about playing. The game comes to you in layers, as you become comfortable moving around, aiming, and dodging, you begin to see new opportunities to improve. Whether it's making a smart predictive shot through the wall, or suckering an opponent into attacking you when you have a hidden teamate nearby, you'll start to get hype on smart plays, and you'll feel the pressure of avoiding your opponent's in turn. Integration with curse voice is nice, and even if you don't feel like jumping on the mic, there are shortcut keys to make tons of useful communications. This takes some getting used to but you get fast on it.

The game is at it's best in Conquest(the primary mode), but sadly is plagued by the same problem every other MOBA has. There is one map, with one set of objectives. As far as I know Heroes of the Storm is the only game that has bothered offering some variety in the 5v5 queue. I'd like to see them slow down the release of new heroes a bit, and offer some interesting twists in the 5v5 matches.

There is absolutely no pay to win system, and while there's always a lingering balance issue here or there, it's usually not really gamebreaking, and rarely will be enough to stop the better player from winning. You can unlock all the gods through gameplay, and color swaps for thier default skins. That said, the ultimate god pack, unlocks all the gods, current and future, and I strongly recommend it. It's a good way to support the game and it gives you all the toys to play with in your matches. I paid $40 for it, and I ain't even mad. The rest of the cash shop is premium skins and other vanity items, my only gripe in the cash shop are the "chests". These are virtual lottery tickets, the kind so popular in eastern free to play models, and some skins and vanity items are exclusive to these tickets. For me personally paying for a digital item is enough, I don't need to pay for a random digital item.

Pros
+Simple, responsive, movement
+All skillshots, aim and win, miss and lose
+~70 Gods to play, with a good range of abilities,
+Good character balance
+Mostly straightforward cash shop, that doesn't blackmail you with pay to win items, and makes it easy to get ALL the characters
+Robust quick communications system built in.
+Geb

Cons
-One map(in conquest), OVER AND OVER AND OVER...
-Digital lottery tickets
-No truly original characters(though some interesting interpretations on the Gods)
-Tusky
- I decided to try this game  
- Its a very fun game  
- Addictive  
- Everyone called me noob and useless 
- Like in every other game  
-- I recommend this game  
- NOT pay to win  game
I have played this Smite long enough(+1000 hours on it, don't judge me), and I could say its pretty fun. What with all being a MOBA different mechanics and stuff. But I find it more easier to play with than other MOBA games. Though don't get me wrong others are still fun; I just have a difficult time trying to play and all. Smite was the same, but I got used to it thanks to all the matches I played giving me a prime example. All in all, I would most defineitly recommend this game if you would like to taste a different kind of MOBA.
Played hundreds of hours before the Steam release since beta, and now I can track how much of my life I waste playing this great game. Also I can use Steam money to buy ingame stuff, so that's a plus. 11/10 would recommend.
First review, just wanted to say this game is great.

No pay to win mechanics
All in game purchases are purely costmetic
Frequent giveaways and free in game currency that'll give you the ability to gain cosmetic items

I have 1600 hours in, and I'm sure I'll likely put in many more.
After 5k hours played i surpose its time i did a review and all i have to say is this is 100% the game i enjoy, pvp, 3rd person view...mages, hunters... its got it all and some amazing artwork aswell.  It is not ptw either you can buy voice packs and skins for the gods but other than that everyone is on a lvl playing field.  Only negative i have to say about this game is that a majority of the community are very toxic and have a culture of reporting persons after every match.
Great game overall, but it has its flaws.

PROS:

[list]
[*]Combines the strategic gameplay of a MOBA with the intuitive controls of an FPS. If you've always wanted to try a MOBA, but you don't like point-and-click RTS controls, SMITE is the perfect entry point for you.
[*]The gameplay is mechanically solid and surprisingly deep. Most characters can pull off satisfying combos, and every character can use their skills and abilities in surprising ways. Plus, the game rewards you for mastering its hidden tech. The better you are at SMITE, the more fun you'll have.
[*]Conquest, the premiere gamemode, is staggeringly complex. There are tons of strategies and mechanics to wrap your head around. Overall, though, SMITE is very noob friendly, with lots of simple game modes to help you learn the ropes.
[*]Teamwork is rewarding. Nothing compares to the feeling of communicating with teammates, coming up with a plan, and pulling it off without a hitch.
[*]Huge variety of characters, all based on cool mythological figures. Some gods, like Zeus and Thor, are well-known. There are also lesser-known gods, like Janus and Baron Samedi. Every character feels different, though some feel better to play than others.
[*]Fast, regular balance cycle. The devs update the game once every two weeks.
[*]Unlike a lot of MOBAs, the majority of the characters are viable in ranked play. Makes for some pretty interesting matches.
[*]Barring the occasional sustain meta, healers aren't as important in SMITE as they are in other MOBAs, which makes fights more impactful.
[*]Despite what some people will tell you, the game is relatively balanced (the key word is relatively), and it's getting better. The current season is the best yet.
[*]Not as predatory as other free-to-play games. You don't need to spend money to unlock characters, although you can unlock every character instantly for $30.
[/list]

CONS:

[list]
[*]This game has a really steep learning curve. Like I said, there are plenty of simple game modes for beginners, but learning to play Conquest is tough.
[*]Lots of bugs, some of which are game-breaking. The worst bugs are usually hotfixed within a day.
[*]This game has a sizeable playerbase, but the players are split between three platforms and eleven game modes, making the playerbase feel lower than it really is. It also results in long queue times. Casual Conquest takes four minutes. Ranked Conquest takes nine minutes. Queue times may improve when cross-platform matchmaking is introduced.
[*]As with all popular multiplayer games, the players can be toxic. Most SMITE players are good people, but it only takes one toxic player to ruin a match.
[*]Hirez Studios, the publisher, makes a lot of weird decisions. For example, the SMITE Pro League is broadcast exclusively on Mixer.
[*]General lack of polish. The flavor text has bad grammar, the UI is a little weird, and the game is poorly optimized.
[/list]

If you like the idea of playing a MOBA, but you want a more intuitive control scheme, SMITE is your best bet. The game is fun, even if it lacks polish.
I have been playing this game faithfully since beta 2011 and I have never found such joy in a game as I do with this one. Sure its a MOBA so the people are going to be toxic from time to time; best to just mute them instead of getting mad. my only downfall for this game is that the support team sucks. They suck a lot. I have never gotten anywhere with them simply because they dont respond back or if they do its an automated messege meaning they didnt even bother reading it. ive lost 1 account which had over 150 dollars worth of skins and gods and icons. they saw raptr desktop game library as a third party hacking system and banned my account forever. I did everything in my power to talk to them but they didnt want to read it I suppose. obviously I wouldnt cheat because why spend so much money on one thing then get it thrown away? I cant do anything now obviously but I wish their support team had the wits to make calm rational decisions all the while informing and apologizing for a misdeed. still love it. 9/10
Apparently it's your fault whenever you don't save your teammate when he tries to to 1v5 the other team.

But honestly, this is a great game. Yeah sure, I mean there are things you can buy with real money but in no way is it "Pay to Win". Smite is a game that requires a lot of hard work and communication with your team. Personally, this game was very easy to pick up on but hard to master (by no means am I a pro Smite player). A decent computer and non-potato internet can also be helpful.
[b]If you think I missed something in my review feel free to tell me [/b]

[h1] Smite[/h1]

Smite is my most played game, and trust me there is a reason for that. I will add a TL; DR at the end.

[h1] Gameplay[/h1]

Smite is a MOBA that has been around for a couple years and has gained some nice popularity. The main thing that people like about smite, that it offers different than other MOBA games such as Dota or League of Legends is that it is in third person. This means you actually have to aim your basic attacks and abilities and you much more control utilized the WASD keys for movement. 

The game itself offers a total of 7 different gamemodes, not including ranked, that you can play. The gamemodes include a 5v5 Arena, 3v3 Joust, 5v5 Conquest, 5v5 Clash, 4v4 Siege, 5v5 Assault and a gamemode of the day that always offers something different. The matchmaking is on a decent timer usually taking anywhere from 20 seconds to 3 or 4 minutes to find a match (usually, ranked can easily take longer). 

In smite there are gods from a handful of pantheons actually to be exact 76 gods in the game as of now, each with varying usefulness depending on the situation. An amazing thing which personally all MOBA games *cough* League *cough* should do is have an ultimate pack like Smite. This ultimate packs includes every single god in Smite, present and future, for one purchase and it is honestly one of the greatest things available. Smite also offers its premium currency as a daily reward and has a good community. By a good community I mean that this game has a good community, not a perfect community, don't get me wrong you WILL run into toxic individuals. I personally play joust and the people I find are kind and helpful and usually understanding, but what people need to understand is the every single MOBA is toxic and smite, for me, seems to be toxic mostly within arena and conquest although you will run into horrible people in other gamemodes as well.  

[h1] Graphics/Sounds[/h1]

The environment in smite is highly detailed and the maps such as joust also have the perk of being quite colorful and interesting in their design. The game also contains music packs which you can gain along with announcer packs which change the default ones given and are able to make your experience quite better if you get the right pack.

[h1] Pros/Cons[/h1]

[b] Pros[/b]

+ Third Person MOBA
+ Good tutorials 
+ 7 different normal gamemodes
+ Ultimate god pack
+ Game events
+ Actual god lore (I mean I could read up on it, but it's a nice thing to look at when in que for a match)
+ Fun to play
+ Much better community than Dota or League (in my opinion)

[b] Cons[/b]

- Certain toxic gamemodes (gamemodes where you will almost definitely run into someone who worsens your experience)
- Achievement Glitch (if you already had a smite account and got a major portion of achievements, those achievements will NOT unlock on steam)

[h1] Final Thoughts[/h1]

I love smite, I won't hide the fact that this game has caught me perfectly. I have 420 hours on record of the time of this review being written and I don't regret a single second. I've met great people who I still regularly play with and I've also met people who simply stunned me (NOT in a good way). I usually play Joust and Assault like crazy because those are the two gamemodes I started with. Now I'm trying to get into conquest, but it's a completely different way of playing when you compare Joust and Conquest. I tried League and I hated it, simply hated it. I tried Dota for awhile, but once Russians and others started yelling at me in different languages because of their own mistakes I dropped Dota too. Then finally Smite was released on steam and I bought the god pack within the first 2-3 weeks of playing and I played with some of my close friends. I left smite for a while just before season 3, but now I've come back and nearly doubled my hours since I took my extended break. 

For someone to be able to write an in-depth review for this game you need around 100 hours in my personal opinion before you've actually started to truly experience the game, but for a funny and quick review a lower time is perfectly alright. You can't go in-depth, truly in-depth with a review for this game with little hours. If you have under 30 then you simply don't know practically anything about this game! Anyway, I do love this game and am glad I found a MOBA which I actually like.

[h1] TL; DR[/h1]

As the funny review which made me try this game said "Smite is the MOBA for people who hate MOBA's". This is a MOBA in third person where you aim all of your abilities and basic attacks, not just click and wait. The game contains 76 gods and 7 different normal gamemodes (not including custom/bot/ranked) at this time so there is a lot of variety for players to try things out. You will run into toxic people, don't get me wrong, but you will also most likely be able to meet good people in different gamemodes as you continue to play who will help you out, be supportive, and compliment you.
I never could get into MOBAs until I tried Smite, I've played Heroes of the Storm, League of Legends, and a very small amount of dota 2. The main thing that I did not like is the isometric viewpoint, as well as the click to move aspect of the traditional MOBA. Smite Fixed all of the that, when you auto attack someone it's not you just clicking on them and the attack auto hitting them no matter what, In Smite it's a skill shot that they can dodge the same principle applies to most abilities.

You start off with 5 base gods for free + another 5 on rotation.
You can buy more gods via in game credits you earn buy playing and leveling up, purchase them with real money individually with gems, or get the ultimate god pack it's $30 and gives you every god in the game as well as every feature god if you plan on playing as lot of smite it's definitely worth it. The community is amazing for a MOBA.

The main con I can think of is the servers. I live in western US and always have over 100 ping normally 120 ish.

Some tips for new players.

Buy beads! You will hear this, a lot in arena it means you should buy Purification Beads from the store it's a cheap on use item that gives you CC immunity when used. As long as you have the auto buy on it should buy them for you.

Yes there is last hitting no there is no denying.

Learn some basic VGS commands http://imagizer.imageshack.us/a/img513/9819/nww2.png

Don't worry about item builds at first. The game will auto buy a basic build for you (you can turn this off at the lobby screen before you enter a match) I recommend to play arena until you get the hang of the base gods.

The traditional MOBA map is called Conquest there is no bottom or top but long/duo lane for ADC and Support you can tell what lane this is because the towers will be farther apart and it will be the side with the gold fury, Then mid normally played by a Mage and solo/short lane normally played by a Warrior (or any god with good clear and sustain) this will always be on the side of the Fire Giant and will be either top or bottom depending if your home is the chaos or order side. Jungler will start off farming lane with solo lane (aka short lane)

If you have any questions ask in the comments and I'll try and answer as soon as I am able.
Smite is one of those games that after you get into it, you never really leave. I can sit here and tell you everything that's broken in this game, yet I'll still play it regardless.
Step 1: Have a break from league of legends 
Step 2: Download Smite
Step 3: Start playing smite
Step 4: ,,Why aren't they blaming each other?"
Step 5: ,,Oh man, community in this game is just a paradise"
Step 6: League of Legends has just uninstalled on its own
Step 7: Never back to LoL again
Step 8: Go back to play Smite

I won't miss you LoL

@Edit: I see that a lot of people complain about my hours spent in this game. This is only time I played Smite connected with steam. I played Smite before it was even on steam. Better check GroznySufit acc. I have played about 600 conq maches.
SMITE is a Third-Person MOBA where you play as Gods and mythical beings from many Pantheons, from the Almighty Zeus representing the Greek Pantheon, Odin representing the Nordic Pantheon, Cabraken representing the Mayan Pantheon, Raijin representing the Japanese Pantheon and much much more!

[h1] Pros [/h1]

[b] Over 70 characters to choose from! [/b] 
And you start out with some of the best gods in the game! 

Ymir is a hard hitting Guardian who can tank many hits while dishing out tons of damage back!

Neith who can achieve a monstrous amount of damage late game and sustain herself with her abilities. 

Thor similar to Neith can achieve a ton of damage and tank hits quite well compared to other assassins, and is considered one of, if not the best assassin in the game.

Ra who is a hard hitting magic healer who is one of the fastest mages in the game.

And finally Guan Yu who is tanky and very annoying to fight against! 

Along with 5 other gods on a weekly rotation, plus you can get some free gods and skins too by following SMITE on social Media and using a program called Curse! Don’t worry everyone these are all legit and supported by Hi Rez!

https://www.smitegame.com/community/facebook/ <- This gives you a Ra skin!

http://www.smitegame.com/community/youtube/ <- This gives Nu Wa and her Water Dancer skin!

http://www.smitegame.com/community/twitter/ <- This gives you Artemis and her Stalker Skin!

http://esports.smitegame.com/facebook/ <- This gives you Janus and his Keymaster Skin!

https://www.smitegame.com/xbox-link/ <- Got an Xbox One? Link your Xbox account with your Hi Rez account to get Zeus and his X Skin!

https://www.smitegame.com/ps4/ <- More of a PS4 Guy? Same deal as above but with your PS4 account, and you get Odin and his Worlds Collide Skin!

And finally is Curse, I cannot post the link due to Steam hating it, however just type Curse SMITE into your Browser and it should take you to the page. Use Curse in one game to get 200 Gems! 5 for Apollo and his Curse Skin! And 10 for Agni and his Curse Skin!

So you can get 7 Free gods just by doing the above! Plus the extra skins are little sweeteners.

[b] A lot of gamemodes! [/b] 

There’s the main game conquest, Joust, Siege, Arena, Clash and more! If there’s one mode you don’t like, there are still plenty of options!

[b] Brilliant Animations and character designs [/b]

All of the animations of the characters fit them brilliantly, plus all the gods stand out and they don’t blend in with each other, my personal favourite animations are from Ao Kuang, who has fantastic attack animations, the way he puts his sword away, and how he reveals his “True Form” to an unlucky enemy. Plus the character designs are fantastic, again Ao Kuang is a good example.

[b] Updates are very common! [/b]

Every 2 Weeks on Tuesday there’s a patch, they are often filled with content ranging from skins, new gods, emotes, gameplay changes, balances and a lot more!
It’s fantastic that updates are really common, a lot of companies should follow Hi Rez’s footsteps.

[b] A large community that has guides and builds all over! [/b]

Want to learn how to play Thor like a boss? Well hop online and look what people have put down about him, there are thousands of guides! So learning is just as easy as landing his Ultimate.

[h1] Cons [/h1]

[b] Questionable Matchmaking [/b]

Often you will find yourself in a horribly unbalanced game, the amount of times where I’ve had less experienced players against a full competitive premade team is painful, and it’s very common for this to happen sadly.

[b] Balance [/b]

Right now SMITE is at its most balanced state, but somethings do need changing, like Hunters in general being too strong, and gods like Kukulkan and Anubis getting the middle finger when it comes to getting buffs (Aka they rarely get any)

[b] Events and chests [/b]

There’s a lot of events recently, while they are fun, they often have exclusive and limited skins, while the exclusive skins will come back in chests later, it’s a pain in the ass to get them sometimes, limited skins however are gone forever, so they are just there to taunt you.
Also speaking of chests, there’s too many chest skins, some don’t even deserve to be chest skins, for an example Bun Bun Nox and King of the Sea Poseidon don’t deserve to be in chests, hell I thought King of the Sea was a Tier 2 Skin before I released it had voice lines, it doesn’t even add new effects! What the hell Hi Rez?

[b] The ingame community is toxic [/b]

Outside SMITE everyone is friendly, inside however… oh boy it’s awful.
If you mess up once, and I mean ONCE! People will start taking the piss out of you.

A perfect example from me was in this game of Clash, I was a Sobek, I was behaving highly aggressive and attempting to get as many kills/assists as possible to get my gold up, about mid game I charged for an enemy and killed him, sadly I got killed in the process from his high damage and a finishing blow from a tower, a Rama said I was “Doing horribly” and I stayed silent, thankfully our Nemesis was on my side and saying “He’s doing better then you”, and at the very end of the match we lost, and I just asked Rama, “Have you even play a hunter before?” As he got less kills and gold then me.

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=697836992

So as you can see, even though I got the most gold which means I did most of the work in the game, there’s always that one guy who will talk shit about you.

[h1] Overall [/h1]

A fantastic 3rd Person MOBA and a lot of fun, just keep calm, do your best, and hopefully I’ll fight you in the battlefield someday.
I think it is about time I did a review for this game.
SMITE in its most simple form is a third-person MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena). However it goes much deeper than that in my opinion. I will explain why.  Keep in mind the negatives outweight the positives in my opinion, however I STILL LOVE and play this game everyday.

Pros:
       SMITE is a game I have played since season 1. and knew about it in it's beta. and the game mechanics have evolved to suit the current META and season for players.
      It is completly free to play. There are NO PAY TO WIN aspects to this game, it is merely cosmetic, and I love the game for that, considering HiRez's business model relies on people buying the premium currency, it is really nice.
      You can be a GOD nuff said.
       The community is active and there are always events of some sort.
       HiRez are constantly updating the game and improving it.
       The skin quality and event quality is improving.

Cons:
      Matchmaking is not the best in this game, however it is being worked on by HiRez.
      Not all gods are balanced along with some items.
      Team mates can sometimes be so annoying that you argue with them, thus lowering the fun you can have.
      Solo queuing will almost always result in an unfair or unbalanced game, for example you could go up against a full premade.
      If you do not know how to build on a god you are at a MAJOR disadvantage. Although steps have been taken recently to improve knowledge amongst new players.
      Loki is in the game.... Need I say much more?
      The server quality (Especially after patch day) is absolute garbage.


That is all I have to say and this is just my opinion, I am also sure I have missed quite a bit out. if you agree or disagree with something let me know :D
Honestly a very good game! But a lot of people are rude / flame and take it so seriously. 
If you are in the actual smite league, yes...I get it. 
But these are randys yelling at people like it's their life. Get in the league and yell then, or exit out of the game. 
What's the point of playing a game if you are so angry
The community is a toxic cesspool of tryhards and ironic memers
Hi-Rez couldn't balance the gods even if their lives depended on it
Most god skins are hamfisted meme-references to appeal to the worst kind of crowd on this planet
and anime has ridden this game and any of it's last qualities into the ground, with no way of ever getting it's dignity back.

8/10, one of the better mobas on the market
Have been playing for a good while before it came to Steam

A great alternative to the isometric style MOBAs. Great selection of Gods to choose from from the Hindu, Chinese, Norse, Mayan, Egyptian‎, Roman and Greek pantheons, fair store prices (you can pay $30/£21 to unlock all current and future Gods(EDIT: Currently £14.06 on Steam!)) with plenty of ways to earn gems for premium skins and deep and rewarding gameplay that is quite unique to the genre. There's also more modes compared to your usual MOBA to keep the game fresh if you're tired of the usual 3 lane & jungle traditional MOBA style games, such as the Arena for pure fighting ability.

Only issues is that the launcher can be a pain, and the servers aren't always the most stable. Otherwise, it's well worth your time to at least give it a try.
Okay... with just hitting lvl 30 and close to 200 hrs under my belt. This game is amazing. Matchmaking sometimes is shit and you have to learn how to work as a team or die. But this game definitely breathes alot of life into the moba genre. I came from League and I am loving it like mad! This is my new game that I love. It fits alot of gameplay styles I love apart from being a MMORPG XD But for what it is, I love it and I cant recommend it enough. Thanks for bringing it to steam as that was when I took my first step into Smite and I dont think I would be leaving it anytime soon. Happy 2 months! and 10/10 would uninstall any other moba.
It's fun, but repetitive, if you're not into mobas I would recommend because it's more captivating. I competely loved this game and still do, just don't really have friends to play it with.
So,  I started playing Smite when my cousin and I had been searching for co-op games to play at night after work and he discovered Smite shortly after it was released on Steam.   We got in,  were totally in awe of the variety and depth of each character... so we immediately bought the God Pack for $30 and began learning which were the most fun for our play styles.  I quickly became fond of Mages & Hunters,  while he went Guardians to be tanky.  

I've logged so many hours since then,  way more than any other game I've tried in the last 10 months or so.   I have an HTC Vive, and until it gets deep games like this that have a long learning curve,  I'll probably continue to play Smite when I have a couple hours free.  

I'd never played a MOBA prior to Smite for more than a single sitting... this game made me appreciate the game type and skill-shot based game play.  I would never have played this if it were tab targeting. 

Smite is addictive and fun... and this is coming from someone that gets bored of games quickly (almost 400 games in my Steam library as of this review).  

Get it, it's free.  There's so much depth between the various Characters and gear, that you might end up absolutely sinking more time than you expected in just learning the game mechanics and nuances.  

Highly recommended!
Very good free-to-play MOBA like game. Well, no. It's exactly same but the 3rd person view on the battlefield and some minor game mechanics that are different.  Plenty of game modes, long roster of gods (hindu, greek, roman, egyptian, norse), no pay2win plague (you can buy the cosmetics only and even that, most things you simply unlock with in-game currency), proper grind fest ...

+ Enjoyable gameplay
+ Plenty of game modes to play, gods to unlock
+ Graphic
+ 3rd persion view
+ Somehow not that toxic community as usual
+ Grind on reasonable level, F2P model
- Grind is still a grind

If you plan to try it out, use pls my referal to make an account: http://www.smitegame.com/play-for-free?ref=iSikorski :) cheers! We both would get bonuses then!

7/10 [i]"Git gud kid"[/i]
SMITE is a third-person MOBA developed and published by Hi-Rez studios. I thoroughly enjoy this game (as you can tell by my hours) and I highly recommend it. I could ramble on forever about this game but I think the most impactful and exciting aspect is the camera angle. The third-person perspective is what initially sparked my interest. I disliked the point and click controls of other MOBAS. In SMITE I feel like I have control over my character and can aim all my abilities freely. In short, if you are looking for something different in the MOBA scene, download SMITE and try it out. Its free so you do not have anything to lose. Also, some people may be turned off because SMITE is a free to play game. Luckily, there is nothing in SMITE that you can pay for that would give you an advantage over another player. You can purchase voice packs, skins, icons, etc.
As someone who has played 440 hours of the steam client smite and someone who played this game during the first year of beta before it was even on steam, and as someone who has played almost every mainstream moba and not as well known mobas, it's an amazing take on a multiplayer battle arena, it really truly is. it is so action packed for people who dont like top down typical mobas and the game really has paved its way into the gaming society being that it was one of the first to be multiconsole, and do it incredibly well (also have played this on xbox) being that i have so much experience with mobas and smite, I would have to say this game is a solid 8.5/10, what really kills it for me is how stupid of a company Hi-Rez really is, and dont even bother commenting "okay then you make a game" I cant, i dont have the technical skill nor money to make my own game to be on par with this, but i am allowed to make judgements, and the dev's dont make the smartest decisions when it comes to this game.
Played 3k+ hours before steam, this game saved my life then ruined it 10/10

edit:but seriously if you can't get into the other MOBA's because of the isometric gameplay Smite is for you.
TL;DR You should try Smite but be wary of the saltstorm.

(Salt/Being Salty: Being angry, agitated, upset.)

Smite is a great game. I've played it since the Beta and have done the 1-30 grind as well as a few ranked games last season.

Now that this has been made clear, i'll discuss what isn't so great about it. To be blunt, the community is shit. We could all agree that online video game communities are generally bad but in Smite more often than not, your game will have someone being salty towards another player for stupid reasons(anything from a teammate feeding, to someone not being able to take a joke or play along). The game has come a long way with all the visual updates and the god balance but the state of the community has just been getting worse every year. But of course, since you can just mute anyone who is fedora-neckbearding in the chat the gameplay doesn't really suffer unless you listen to their crap and let them get at you. In the end though, it's a team game, so you will have to endure some salt one way or the other.

The gameplay side of Smite is well executed and unique in the MOBA genre. The third person view and the familliarity of the gods to the common person makes the game more accessible in my opinion because not every player is interested in Lore and the bird's view in traditionnal MOBAs can be a barrier for the new player who has yet to pick up a game from the genre.

The last point that makes this game for me is the cheap god pack, in which you receive every god released as well as all future gods for like 20$USD. This method is far better than that of LoL/HotS, even though it's not nearly as good as the free DOTA 2 way of going.

Smite is at a great point in it's lifecycle for new players to join in, with the recent Steam addition and the game only being in it's second season of competitive/ranked play. 

Overall, I would recommend playing Smite or simply giving it a try to see if you'd like it because it's definitely worth a shot.
NOTE: I have at least 300-400 hrs Pre-Steam.
I stopped playing Smite quite a time ago and seeing Smite on Steam really caught me by surprise, and a really nice one too. 
I've got back in, having it on Steam makes is ooo much accessible, and it seems it makes patches easier to install. Also payments can be made now through Steam Wallet so that's cool as hell.
Anyways, this game is great, completely free to play to obtain the full expercience. Sure, you need to play quite a bunch to buy Gods, but still, such quality of a game diserves at least some money put into, but it's 100% optional, no P2W.
Great graphics, great gameplay, great artstyle, nice community. Overall really good.
I give this game a bloody awesome 10/10.
I have played this game for over 1,000 hours, and it is fucking amazing. I never really liked MOBAs and I probably never will. I have played games such as Dota, LoL and HOTs but did not like them at all. However Smite has taken over my life. It has a different feel than all the other MOBAs that I cannot describe but I definately would recommend to anyone
Few reasons: * I like mythology aspect.
Majority of players are not toxic.
Most of non ranked games contains deal in lobby when picking gods.
Early minions are tough.
Gold is received even if not last hit.
Mana is not a big issue (eat your heart out LoL!).
3rd person perspective.
Skill-shot based game.
Fast paced.
Voice commands (Oh hi other MOBA's!).
Separated potions from items (eat your heart out LoL!).
Worst decision of my life....I'm addicted to masochism now.

Want a game that makes you question life? Play Smite.
Want a game where the developement team has no idea what they're doing? Play Smite.
Want a game where the community is toxic and literally just tilts you to no end? Play Smite.
Want a game where the focus point is one mode, so they ruin the balancing for all other modes? Where they make items in game that can change metas? Where they completely change kits of characters to the point it's broken and makes the game complete aids? PLAY SMITE.

BUT HEY, I GOT COOL SKINS. MY GODS LOOK FABULOUS SO THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
  Lets get this out of the way, I hate MOBA's to all hell, but this game is real special. It's no point and click fuck fest, it's third person goodness. You use WASD like anyother game, unless it's LOL or dota. It's really something different, and I would recommend you guys checking it out! It's worth a try.
I was never a Dota or LOL player. Never really liked the MOBA genre until I played Smite. I really enjoy Smite. The game modes, the gameplay is really fun. The community can be rude at times, but there are still plenty of cool players who enjoy the game and supportive. Strongly recommended. If possible get the Ultimate God Pack. I got mine during sale and it's really worth it. Enjoy Smiting!
This game is not begginer friendly at all. There's alot to learn from what items do what and what to buy and when. that seems rather simple but when you throw into the mix that alot of builds and items are situational and for most characters you will want something different to better support their play style. now you have to learn the play style of every character. Now you have to work out how every mode works including where you start and who gets what camps and when. Now after you've learned all that it's going to change within a couple months because smite is unbalanced and they constantly change things to try and fix it.  Once you finally get properly into smite it's an amazing and challenging game that gives out what you put in. Rage inducing? Yes! But also just as rewarding when you pull of that triple in joust or low and behold the almight penta!! All the gods are unique and quite often roles such as gaurdian aren't just locked into being defensive there are some broken gaurdians that do some spicy damage, the game has alot of variety. It's just all down to you to learn the basics, there are some great youtubers and guides out there, and once you get past that Smite is a great fun rage inducing game.
Great game if you put the time and effort into it. Beginners will strugle a little, but ive been back and forth on this game since the beta, playing and then stop playing. I probably have over 400 hours in total in this game across ps4, pc over the years, and I have grown to love this MOBA over Dota 2 and League of Legends. Great game :)
Smite and I have a love/hate relationship. I spend all my time with it but it still fucks me over. Like all MOBAs, Smite has a toxic community. To be frank, I wouldn't recommend new players to try this out alone since matchmaking isn't always fair and it's way more fun with friends anyway especially with the voice chat that they've added. I'm a sucker for god and goddess folklore so playing characters with abilities that match their lore and the variety and ever expanding pantheons is what makes Smite stand out. 

If you're coming from another MOBA, I feel like building and items are even more important here so if you're new, read guides! The builds online have been super helpful for me since I'm definitely not as good as most. 

All in all, I do recommend Smite. Among all the salty spammers, DCers, and the "VER VVX"s, there are small factions of the community that are friendly and are willing to help. Also, it never stops getting satisfying stomping enemy teams. So, if you're looking for a casual Aphro/Da Ji main, holla at your girl "ehazen". 

Also shameless Smite let's play advertising: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr4mMtLeIOrAeYSfMh1peSA?view_as=subscriber
Only game where you can watch the god of death get murderd by the other god of death only to be avenged by the harbringer of death finally ending it with a fat man belching om him to death.
10/10
This game has some amazing features that just blow any other dota-like game (dota included) out of the water:

1) It's in third person view, so you can't possibly missclick.
2) It has decent net-code so you won't lose 2 hours long game because server didn't realize you pressed your ult over 20 times in one second.
3) Girls have breast and butt physics.
4)You actually feel the power of your overfed hero since you're so close to the action.
5) Comeback is actually real.
6) There are very few other games with such aestetics that don't make my eyes bleed

There are, though, few flaws that made me bite the chunk of my keyboard off.

1)Forced tutorial (I know a-rts players aren't most clever creatures in the world, but sure they can figure out how to press wasd and left mouse button on their own?) I had to play tutorial 3 times because it bugged on shop stage 2 times.
Now i'm veri gud ot pressing wasd thanks obongo.
2)If your game crashes when you're picking a hero, you will just sit for hours holding your peter because you will immediately get deserter penalty.
3)Someone WILL leave right in your first match.
4)Not nearly enough r34.

I will give final verdict after i sink several thousands hours into this.


Oh Smite, how long has it been since I played you last? I remember playing it back in the beta (You know where Ao Kuang actually was a dragon and Nu Wa didn't have fire shards raining down for her ulti), dropped it for a while (mostly due to me not having the same amount of fun nowadays), but here are the pros and cons for this game to the best of my abilities.

[b]PROS:[b]

-Wide selection of gods and goddesses from a plathera of mythologies. You have the standard Greeks and Romans, but also Chinese, Hindu, Mayan, Egyption, Norse, Japanese and now Celtics.
-3rd person makes you feel like you're in the fight instead of just pointing and clicking.
-Great with friends.
-New gods come out fairly recently in between patches, so you aren't waiting a long time for one to pique your interest.

[b]CONS[b]

-Community is always salty, but that should be a given considering it's a MOBA. Just keep your head held up high and stay calm and you should be fine. 
-Matchmaking wasn't the best when I played, sometimes you'd be put into a horrible scenario where the other team just curbstomps yours. 
-Transactions are still there, but it's mostly cosmetic things like skins, announcers, icons for your profile, etc. 

There are many flaws in this game, but I'm not going to list of all of them, I'm fairly sure someone did that already.

Overall do I recommend SMITE? I'd have to say maybe. Depending if you want to try a third person MOBA and can handle the saltiness and matchmaking being completely stupified. But since there's no middle option, I'd say yes, but only if you have friends that you can play with so you're not stuck playing with randoms who may not have an idea of what their doing. 

I'd give SMITE a 7/10. Good with friends, not so good if you're just waiting around in queues by yourself.
Smite is MOBA game that let you play as gods in another perspective. Is it so different than LoL or Dota? No, its almost the same, but it kick fuckin ass! I am veteran of both games, in LoL i have over 3500 hours, in Dota 2 i have almost 1400 hours, and i can tell, smite is most innovative game in genre. AMAZING god mastery system, fun and addicting gameplay. I will not tell you what about is moba games, all of you know what this is about. Trust me, Smite is very,very good game, one of the best in its kind, for some maybe the best, not for me, because for me game is good or bad, nothink between. Smite is good, good as hell. 0 microtransactions, cheap all gods, comparing to league of legends, all gods in code in online store cost lik 1 and half of champion in league of legends. Oh, did i mentioned mastery system? It makes you wanna play more and more, become better and better. Gameplay is original and makes fun, like you are god, its extreme action. Just try it, if you like Moba games, you will love smite.
Awful community, but extremely fun if you have friends or can find the few nice people who play this game. Or you can just mute everyone and enjoy yourself to your heart's content.
Things that are preventing this game from becoming one of the best games out there :  
- Bugs. More bugs in this game than almost every other game I've ever played. Some have been in the game for years.  
- UI. The Interface was recently done to have the same as console, now it's okay for console but on PC it is worse in every way and extremely hard to navigate. Bugs with the UI makes it difficult just to get people in a party to play the game.  
- Matchmaking. It's gotten better over the years but still far from perfect.  
  
Things I really enjoy about the game  
- Free to play. You do not need to spend a dime to master this game, however the god pack is extremely worth it and best deal you will get with any other game. There is nothing you can do to spend money and give you an advantage over other players.  
- 3rd person. Feels a lot better for skillshots than games like League of Legends  
- MYTHOLOGY. The game is based around REAL pantheons and it's really cool to see those gods come to life.  
  
If this game had no bugs it would be one of the best games out there. However it's been buggy since beta and is arguably MORE buggier than beta now. I want to believe it will get better but years later it is not. It's embarrassing to try to get a friend to play this game because of certain bugs but at the end of the day I love this game and will probably always play it till the servers shut down. Been playing since Christmas, 2012.
I've played this game for over two and a half years and it’s like a drug. I keep trying to leave but I inevitably come crawling back. 

Honestly, the game is great fun. But make sure you que with friends because the community is at a deadly level of toxic. Not surprising after it picked up a larger player base following its release from beta, but sometimes I have to sit back and wonder what happened to this game. Community used to be great, laid back, friendly and willing to dick around in casual matches; but now I can hardly get through one match without some guy telling me I'm playing wrong, or going off the rails because we're behind a bit. But of course this would happen, it’s a great free to play game, and with that will come the undesirables. 

Gameplay is solid, the frequent patches (which can be somewhat hard to keep up with) keep the game fresh, and there's a new god release pretty often (at least once a month, give or take a week) so the Meta is changing constantly. The number of playable gods have almost doubled from when I started playing, so new content is always available. (Although in my opinion god releases are a little to frequent for my taste). Due to the consistently growing god pool, the ultimate god pack is undeniably worth it. The price hasn't changed from 3 years ago, and all current gods + all future gods for £20 is a steal.

I love smite I really do, it was my game of the year last year, and it will almost always be at the top of my lists, despite all things I hate about it. It’s definitely worth playing, its F2P for Christ sake, just be careful you don't get hooked. And God help you if you queue for league...God help you.
The best moba i have ever played. It has its flaws, but still it stands its ground. It has a fair micro transactions. I never spent any money and i have 310 skins just by playing and unlocked all 100 gods.  Playing from Season 3 and now its Season 6 and u know what, i bought the battle pass just for free by the free gems i collect weekly. When i get burned out in any other games, this is my casual go to game to just chillax.
[h1]LAUNCH THE GAME BY DOWNLOADING STANDALONE LAUNCHER FOR SMITE https://www.smitegame.com/download/  [/h1]

Game launches fine without Steam, which makes me sad because I love steam, but this works if you're trying to play Smite. The game is fine, everyone relax and stop being so toxic.
As someone who has invested god knows how many hours into the game on the ps4 version I can honestly say that this is one of my favorite MOBA not based on gameplay nessicarily but more on the variety of Gods to play as. I think that its niche actually distinguishes itself in many ways because of it. Highly recommend.
Love this game, but the Steam version isn’t the best to get, it just won’t start up the game at one point. I recommend you play it if you like MOBAs, but download the actual launcher from HiRez’s website.
It's a pretty safe bet you already know if you're interested in this before looking at any reviews, but here's my initial (20-odd hours) impressions. The game feels more HotS than Dota, and in that I mean it's an incredibly streamlined MOBA experience with some items thrown in. The main mode is Conquest (3 lanes, towers, 'fountain', general MOBA) but there's other more streamlined modes like Arena (5v5 with emphasis on fights and no towers), Joust (3v3, one lane and you kill the 'fountain') etc, and they're where i've spent most of my time.

Pros:

I like relic system, they give you special abilities (immunity to stuns, blink etc), but with the increased cooldowns (cd) they're almost like extra ultimate, and you can have up to 2 at any one time.
The game is incredibly easy to pick up and play, and while it's in first-person you don't need pro FPS skills since aiming is essentially along the horizontal plane and with most abilities having a rather forgiving effect radius you'll never struggle too much. Matches are snappy too, with most lasting 15-20 minutes, and with the way gold/XP is dished out you're generally kitted out pretty well just after the mid-games finished.  
I've had a handful of lag problems, and by that I mean literally 2 of 50+ games have had issues, that's not too bad for me. 
Finally, the cross-play/progression is great, I can play here then just up and log into the Switch and have everything there ready to go, just a super neat thing and personally what finally made me pick this up.

Cons:

Coming from DOTA the lack of polish and QoL is pretty hard to adjust to. You can have one custom loadout per character, and there's no integrated search system for new ones or even an option to import them, you literally have to add every item and ability manually, which is baffling when DOTA 2 has the pretty damn great guides accessible during the match. No couriers here either, which means you either go teleport back to base for your new potential game-changer and trudge back or hold position and risk losing a big fight, again pretty odd omission.

I bought the God pack (all the characters) after a few hours so it's fair to say I pretty like it, means I can't comment on the F2P aspect with regards character unlocks, but generally the system seems fine for the other stuff you can buy. I've also not put much time into the 'main' mode Conquest, everything else seems to be more what i'm looking for right now though. If you like MOBAs but can't be arsed with the 20+ minutes of prep time in DOTA i'd recommend this wholeheartedly. It's not as deep sure but you rarely feel like you're not doing anything and i've yet to encounter the Russians. If that's not a reason to get on it I don't know what is.
Pros:
fun for casual play
almost every god in the game is fun to play
for the most part good servers (in my experience)
if you have a group of 3-5 its fun and easy to get in to (unlike league or dota)

Cons:
hirez does not know how to balance and as of recently does not listen to there community
all they care about is selling skins (literally like 7 skins a patch)
not the greatest game if you want to show your skill or climb in ranked just play league
ranked is very questionable 


now i say i don't not recommend this game but if you want a new game to play for like a month or so its fun for that but as you play the game more and more you find out how alot of the time (especially in ranked) that the game is a lot like a mountain you have gods all spread across it and what ever god is higher up the mountain will win the game which you think you would want in a moba but its not fun when you know you are going to lose when they pick the better god now if you are just getting in to the game right now play it ive been playing since season 2 and i loved every second of it until i came to the conclusion that all hirez cares about is money like i have taken a break since the end of season 3 and coming back now i still see the same gods being played and being top tier 

take this as you will but i stiil love the game at its core and if you can get over all of what i said then go right ahead and you will enjoy the game but i fell like hirez need to step it up or there game will soon die and i would hate to see that happen

[h1] The Cow Review Of SMITE [/h1]

[b] DISCLAIMER [/b] I have tried to be easy on the cow puns, but bad puns are included. Please be cowtious.

So, I'm a cow. Moo. This review is made to not be amoosing at all. I'm far too serious.

Anyway, as you might be able to tell from the hours I have in this game, I kinda like it just a little tiny bit. 

[u] PROS [/u]
- Very diverse and changeable gameplay, 
- Frequent updates (generally 1-2 per month)
- It's free to play
- God pack lets you play everyone for a very reasonable price (just look at other MOBAS)
- Everything except cosmetics can be earned by playing
- Third person view rather than overhead
- A very handy mute button (see below)

[u] CONS [/u]
- Updates often introduce bugs that are left till next update
- Some changes are not what most of the community wants (eg the recent UI change)
- Takes a long time to learn and there are few new players (so matchmaking is kinda bad)
- A decent amount of toxic people (then you shall praise the moote button, *[i] clears throat [/i]* mute button)
- Very hard to find games unless you are on EU/NA servers

So, what is it that makes this game so diverse you ask? Well, to begin with there is only a measly 100 playable characters (gods) to choose from across many different pantheons and more are on the way (next one is the unpronounceable snake).  There are the normal modes: Conquest (5v5), Joust (3v3), Arena (5v5), Seige (4v4), Clash (5v5), and other temporary ones. On top of this there are ranked modes for Conquest, Joust, and Duel (which obviously must be a 2v2, duh).

Now, if you happen to want to watch some people play to get an idea of how it works I'm going to mention a couple of streamers which I personally think are pretty nice. 

[u] MsPandAlyssa [/u]
[url=https://www.twitch.tv/MsPANDAlyssa] https://www.twitch.tv/MsPANDAlyssa [/url]
Really nice person, plays a nice mix of casual and ranked games and makes a real effort to focus on hanging out with the chat rather than focusing on the gameplay much. Often happy to try things if you ask and if you watch long enough you can get her to dab (she hates dabs). My personal favourite. Also 90% panda which is pretty cool (cow is a little better tho).

[u] BaRRaCCuDDa [/u]
[url=https://www.twitch.tv/barraccudda] https://www.twitch.tv/barraccudda [/url]
Haven't spent much time in the actual streams because time zones but he's nice, a pro player, and tends to hang out with cowl (uh, cool) people during the streams.

Anyway, hope this helps, I'll just moooove out before someone holds me accowntable for this.



Oh, you're still reading, ummmm hi.
Not sure why my reviews keep disappearing
Pay no mind to the 157 hours game play I was playing this game during beta. I have many many many hours in this game because it is ridonkulus fun. Bottom line period this is a fun game. That being said the toxic community can suck all the fun right out of it. This is the only MOBA I have played maybe it is just the genera but this is the single worst community I have ever seen, on top of that the cash grab loot chest from the last time I saw was getting out of hand. So bottom line if you can put up with a toxic community and i mean TOXIC as well as ignore the unreasonable micro transactions (not all are bad I do suggest getting the god pack) you will have a ton of fun.
Hi-rez, please fix your game. You have a loyal fan base waiting for you. Smite is a game that doesn't come around anymore. Listen to your community and you will be back to legendary status as in s3, s4, and maybe s5. For anyone who is considering on playing this for their 1st time, please dont hesitate to install. The game isn't bad, its the developers that is limiting the potential this game has.
This game is one of the MOST broken, MOST unbalanced, MOST cancerous games I've ever played and for whatever reason i still see myself crawling back to it, like a druggie needing his next fix. Whenever I'm at my lowest points in life, i just look at Loki and realize this isn't the lowest life has to offer, at least i don't auto lock Loki like a mouth breathing neck beard. this game is fun as long as you pick anything besides Osiris, and without a doubt the one god that stand above all others, the god that makes Golden bow rise from the dead just to kill it's self in complete horror of this god that was born in the dankest of streams, behold Kuzenbo! 10/10 for dank memes, 6/10 because that one asshole teammate (you know who you are) and 10/10 for cancer.
Cross-platform was a fun idea, took me a couple days to get used to but it's okay! definitely some bugs here and there, but really good for a free-to-play game. I also recommend getting the god pack, gives you more to play around with.
10/10 game, do not believe that this game is full of toxic players!

There are a lot of good players out there, alot of nice poeple, who are willing to help you!! <3

Season 6 is amazing!
Can I "Recommend" this game? Yes

Game is very friendly, Awesome characters, Awesome Moves etc.

Just make sure you have friends to help, or you might be smashing your keyboard asking wtf your teammates are doing..
Keep in mind that I have played Smite for 4 years now, these Steam hours are merely 1/5 of my whole playtime.
I've spent about 2000 euros on this game, and while I don't regret any of those purchases, I really can't recommend this game in this state. Smite is not the problem, it's a good game. Hi-Rez is the issue.

If you enjoy basically non-existent lore, cash-grabs and rigged systems, cancerous matchmaking, unbalanced and clearly developer-favored characters, bugs aplenty, one completely incapable and utterly useless CEO that holds back the whole department and one of the most toxic communities that even rivals Overwatch's community, Smite is your game.

Back when I started playing, Smite was still in open beta and probably my favorite game for years. It was diverse, set itself apart from all other MOBAS through its 3rd person perspective and tons of different maps. It also had that great concept where you could just buy a skin that you wanted. But then Hi-Rez published it's first chests. There were only 2 exclusive skins, but they quickly realized how much money they could make off that garbage system. In the following years, 95% of all new skins were exclusive or limited - put in cash-grab events or chests. There was a time where there wasn't a single directly purchasable skin for 6 or more months. To this day there are still gods with well over 5 skins, all of them exclusive.

Let's put this into perspective: There are literally [b]128 types of chests[/b] in this game. They range from 200gems to 400gems, so about 3,20€ to 6,40€ respectively, [b]per roll[/b]. As a new player, you have 0/55 items from the Curiosity Chest. Each roll costs 3,20€. The chests are also rigged, not joking here, which means you'll get the skin at ~53/55, which puts you at a staggering 170€ just to get that one skin you wanted. 
And every single season, the grande finale of cash grabs, the so called "odyssey". Smite teases one "Tier5 skin", a skin that changes basically everything a god has to offer in terms of design. It's comparable to LoL's ultimate skins, which cost about 20€. The only issue here is, that you can't directly buy the skin. You [b]have to[/b] get a ton of other exclusive skins you probably don't even want for that one T5 skin that's barely worth 20 bucks. You'll lose about 100€, if not more, in this great "odyssey", as Hi-Rez likes to title it. The odyssey is also often accompanied by several "adventures". Adventures are basically one sort of RPG where you choose one god and kill some monsters. The catch is, this map doesn't change, the map always remains the same, and all rewards are either locked behind a paywall (who would have guessed) or a tedious grind-fest that'll probably take millions of your brain cells and about 2 weeks of your life. I'm not even going to talk about the recent "adventure", because that's just a pure joke.

Now, bugs. Smite suffers from so many bugs, many of which are present since closed beta. Some of the more recent ones are so gamebreaking it's honestly a joke that they're not fixed yet. First off, In 99% of all matches, lobby chat just doesn't work. It won't even appear in your chat box. You can't communicate with your teammates while you pick your gods. 

Second, also in 99% of all matches, one or more gods won't load in your stats screen. Which basically means, that, if you press TAB, it won't list that particular god. You can't see their items (which in turn means you don't know how to build against them), you can't see their relics, not even their score. Their kills [b] aren't even listed for your team[/b]. You basically have a ghost. 
Also, sometimes your game just freezes on defeat or win screen and just crashes alltogether. Present since beta, they're just addressing it, after 4 years.

While we're at it, I just want to point out Hi-Rez' favoritism, regarding both gods and modes. As you would expect with gods, there are just certain gods which are blatantly overpowered or just unfun to play against. These can usually be identified by looking at their skins, because they usually have billions. Examples would be Loki, Neith, Hercules or Nox. These are not necessarily overpowered, but have heavily bloated kits which make them almost unkillable and totally unfun to play against. 
Now modes. Like I said before, Smite has a multitude of gamemodes, many more than Hots, LoL or DotA. Now, the issue is, the whole game is balanced around the "main" mode, Conquest; the typical 5v5 tower-and-minion-push mode, which every moba has. In my 4 years of Smite, I have played 18 matches of Conquest. To compare, I've played over 2000 matches of Arena (5v5 without towers), 600 in Joust (3v3), 500 in Siege (4v4) and 900 matches of Clash (5v5 mix between Conquest and Arena). I never really found the ambition to learn all 4851 rules of Conquest, so I stuck to the other gamemodes which barely required 2 of my 5 braincells. Hi-Rez just tries to force Conquest down your throat at every single possible moment. IIRC, one of the design-leaders even talked about removing other modes so people would flock to Conquest. This alone truly catches the sheer incompetence of Hi-Rez's executives. Most players even stated they would quit before they'd even touch Conquest.

At last, Smite's community. I'm more of a casual and average player, but every single match you're plagued by atleast one incredibly inept (most of the time they're low level because matchmaking sucks) or toxic player, sometimes even both. The problem is, that just like in many other games, most players think way too highly of themselves. But Smite players take the cake. They not only play gods, they [i]think they are gods.[/i] The ultimate pinacle of garbage this game has to offer can be found on reddit. You can't criticize one single god without some white knight showing up and defending their true love like there's no tomorrow, because "muh waifu". It's one of the most toxic communites you'll ever see in any videogame, so rev up these mute buttons. Just be aware that you can't mute incompetence. Also, the matchmaking is so fucking bad that I have a legit 85% winrate this season. Every game balances the winrate around 50%.

In conclusion, I'm fascinated that both Hi-Rez and Smite are still alive. Hi-Rez ran so many good games into the ground, gunned them down in the streets or left them to rot in their bug-infested basement, it's a miracle that the company isn't bankrupt. Play this game if you want, but you'll be disappointed in the long run, which is the worst kind of disappointment. Many years I've defended both Hi-Rez and Smite, but at this state, it doesn't make any sense to. I've had my fun, I don't regret a single penny or minute I've spent, but I'm about done.
A game that is absolutely in the deathgrip of a bad decision driven company.  This game is no longer about the love and passion that was felt years ago.  The steady decisions to ignore or just flat out be incompetent at addressing the communities complaints are the only real constant here, to be honest. Oh, and a constant influx of new bugs while old ones remain and even evolve in annoyance.

[b]God Design[/b]
I have been an active player of this game for about 5 years, (Athena's release).  As a reference, this is about midway through beta.  I've got 2440H and 55M, so almost about 700 hours additional to the numbers shown here in Steam.  It seems like every hour I play these days is just enjoyed less and less.  During beta, and early season 1 + 2, there was a really heartfelt development aura that you could feel with every patch.  The gods that came out were much more enjoyable than almost everything that's come out during the past year or so, (I will admit, I do love Cerberus.)  But when you compare gods like Chernobog, Achilles, Hachiman, and Thoth to gods like Tyr, Ah Muzen Cab, Janus, and Scylla, you can just tell there really isn't much actualy originality being dumped into these kits.  They may have one mechanic that is new and exciting, but other than that, its just a better version of a previous gods ability and a boring passive slapped onto it to make it feel like its actually fresh.  (It isn't)

[b]Chests[/b]
Now you've got the community wide absolutely hated chest mechanic.  Originally when chests came out, they were all right.  There was a chest with approx 55 items in it, including voice packs, higher tier skins.  It was pretty cool.  Also included was the new Nuclear Ymir skin and Derpules skin.  Neither of these skins were really that out there as far as the original appearance, but they had nice little gimmicks.  Derpules took the joke of the community hating new hercules model's tiny head and took it further, giving him a pea sized head and a funny helium voice pack.  Nuclear ymir was also just a bright green version of ymir with a fun and unique voice pack and some pretty impressive effects added on.  These two skins were not exactly incredible, but they were fun and acquirable if you had already invested into much of the (much smaller) cosmetic inventory.  Now, every single patch that comes out, there is a new chest (Sometimes even three), slapped full of random older skins and all kinds of miscelleaneous cosmetic bullshit that shouldn't be in the game either.  I believe it was something along the lines of 8 months before an actual Direct purchase skin was released.  Everything was a gamble.  And that is bullshit.  Many of the skins are now just unoriginal theme crap, 

[b]Community Relations[/b]
Last year Hi-rez also had many of their employees be let go, quit, or fired.  Nearly every member of this employee pool was a well known, well liked asset of the community.  Now the company is flooded with all of these people that don't seem to even really give a shit about engaging in the community.  SNK8Four is my prime example.  This man was absolutely adored by the community, the pro scene, and pretty much anyone that began watching smite on twitch in its early days.  He was very much the face for many people that began early.  Then just one day, he's gone.  (To be fair, Hi-Rez no longer deserves him.)  So these decisions are just weird from an outside perspective.  The new character design lead is just full of shit, the new artwork / effect guy (HiRezChuck or some shit) is just a flat disppointment with everything, (WE NEED MORE ANIME AND SKULLS GUYS). Its really just confusing to see this massive sweeping directional change that the game has had, especially considering HiRez floundered their partnership with Tencent which included remodeling and removing pretty much everything in the game with skulls, and now they are just fucking everywhere.  Its edgy and annoying.

[b]Matchmaking[/b]
Here's one that was brought up in the comments, and should rightfully be added.  I guess I'm just too numb to it at this point to have thought it up while typing.  The matchmaking in this game, is terrible.  Absolutely terrible.  The queues are diluted because there are so many.

Here is a list of all game modes and a short description
[i]Conquest[/i] - The tried and true three lanes and jungle MOBA format.
[i]Siege[/i] - Two lane smaller map, with 4v4 and an objective boss in the middle to facilitate pushing.  Intended to be a somewhat shorter mini conquest.
[i]Arena[/i] - 5v5 Death match, minimal wave farming.  Its pretty much just the chance to beat the snot out of each other.  This is the game that is ranked as the most popular.
[i]Clash[/i] - Also kind of a mini conquest, however its 5v5 still with far less focus on jungle, as the lanes are closer together.  Pretty much arena with a little bit more farming and a center objective boss.
[i]Joust[i/] - 3v3 Single lane, small side jungles and an objective boss in the middle portion.  Also a more popular game mode than Conquest.
[i]Duel[/i] - 1v1 Joust on same map.  Ranked only
[i]Assault[/i] - All random gods 5v5 one lane.  No backing until death.
[i]Mode of the day[/i] - Random garbage that cycles through every day.  (All same god no cooldowns etc)

With all of this, you can sit in queues for 10+min just to find a conquest game.  Arena game queues are quick, but we all get matched with a random group of people it seems.  People with 100 hours fighting me and my buddies who combine for like 6k hours.  Ranked divisions seem to have minimal impact also.  Diamond queues up, waits 4 mins for a game, then is on a team full of golds against golds.  A+

[b]God balance[/b]
This is Hirez's biggest problem, in my opinion.  I get the skins in chests thing.  I get the god design thing.  I get the business/employee thing.  But when your game is about beating the crap out of each other, is it not an all around better idea to focus on improving that aspect?  New gods are horribly bloated, every ability becoming a novel to read as opposed to the long forgotten "This ability will hurt people in front of you" mechanic.  Old gods are left to rot, unless Hirez has decided to do massive sweeping changes to an entire kit, buffing three separate things about them and then wondering why they are overtuned, of which they will then follow with sweeping nerfs that do not address the new problems and simply deteriorate a god to uselessness once more.  OP Gods sit at that stage for a much longer period of time than you would expect.  Conveniently when the oddyssey skin for Ullr came out, (Buy all the items throughout a time period = approx 140$USD), Ullr managed to sit at 100% P/B rate for Months.  MONTHS.  Tiny little nerfs came in to give the appearance of adjustment, but it was incredibly shallow and obvious.  3 months after the skin came out and was no longer acquirable, he was hit with multiple nerfs, bringing him in line. When a new god is released, there are two possible scenarios.   

Scenario 1) This god is unstoppable.  He can do everything by himself, requires no assistance, and will absolutely make everyone else have 0 fun, if the person playing them took the 10 mins it usually take to figure out the core mechanics of this god.

Scenario 2) This god is absolutely horrible.  The kit is just a mishmash of clashing abilities which in no way shape or form synergize together and will just serve as three random situational abilities with an ult that hopefully does something, (Looking at you Chernobog).  


This game is a huge part of my life, and I do not want to even KNOW how much money I have actually spent on it over the years, including a +1500$ to the world championships in January of 2015.  (EDIT - I forgot I also attended in 2016)

But, it is also a huge regret and a downward slope.  HiRez needs to get their shit together, because this game could easily be so incredible, but they refuse to take the proper steps.
Been playing the game for over 3.5k hours and another 1k outta steam.  Smite to me is one of the best games ever and has massive potential especially this year with paragon and other 3rd person moba's shutting down.  But Hi-rez being the bad company they have always been seemed to mess that up almost as bad a realm royale.  The game isn't so new player friendly and will probably never be.  I've said this over and over again and i will keep saying it, Smite along with Hi-rez will not last another season, season 6 will be their downfall.  They do not listen to the community very well, and will just make skins and more skins and put them in chest that cost like 300-400 gems, and like i get ya got to make money on a f2p game, but it gets the point where it seems like a scam.  It pains me that the community itself doesn't even realize how dead the game is becoming and will soon shut down later next year in 2019 due to how stupid Hi-rez is and will forever be.  Elo, MMR, whatever you wanna call it has always been worst than most multiplayer games, and this is coming from someone who has competed on levels with pros in their prime and has been in challengers, i can say matchmaking is disgustingly bad and will probably stay that way.  I have had a few times where i feel like i can actually enjoy the game, but thats so short compared to the rest of my time playing.  Another big issue with Smite is the coding, its extremely outdated and they refuse to overhaul the coding and make it modern and less buggy, if they can simply do that i can assure you smite can last for years on just that alone.  But sadly thats not the case and all Smite is now these days is just a skin simulator.  SWC, or Smite Worlds this year has the been worst in terms of the size, production, and just quality in general was horrible and they still refused to fix any of the issues that happened during worlds.  I love this game to death and that was just a few of the issues i had with the game, and if just Hi-rez went 1-2 patches without skins, accessories or just any bs and just focus on bug fixes, overhauling the coding, item bug fixes/balancing, and god bug fixes/balancing i can assure you smite can be as great as LoL and Dota 2, but will probably remain in their shadows till Smite Shuts down.  This is my review of the game, and i hope you can respect, and understand where i'm coming from, and sorry for my broken english.
I have over 1.2k hours in this game (only 905 on steam). Been playing since beta. Spent a ton of rl money in game. In the top 2% of casual elo. 

Have never been banned and rarely got notifications of any one I ever reported for harrassment being banned. Not a problem normally I mean I played lol it comes par for the course with any online multiplayer/competitive game. I have heard about twitch streamers and Hirez people just randomly banning people for silly reasons but never saw it in that whole time.

Last game I played I had someone from Hirez on team and he was playing poorly on all fronts. We got into it after I asked him to get a certain item to help him and after the game he continued in lobby where I ignored him. Entered a new game and got dcd. Never happens. Got a weeks ban hammer for having it out with someone from Hirez. I mean when their own employee can't handle the community they created and work for it says something. Very unprofessional. It would be different if I have a history of being banned. I don't.

Needless to say I am done with Smite and Hirez. Not that Hirez had anything but Smite.
Smite has to be, without a doubt, one of the greatest games I've ever played. That's why it just sucks and honestly feels wrong to give it such a negative review. I've put over 1.5k hours into the game, paid for hundreds of dollars worth of chests and skins, and had a ton of fun with the game, all while trying my best to ignore its flaws. However, I can't ignore the flaws anymore; the game has become too much focused around chest opening and limited item collecting for it to be fun anymore.

I was planning on writing an elaborate analysis of all the things wrong with the game, but I came to realize only one thing is truly wrong with the game; Hirez Studios. They had created a near-masterpiece of a game that was unique to the MOBA genre and excellent in every way, but the overwhelming flaws have drowned the game and distanced it from which it once was. Hirez has failed in three majors items; the balancing and development of their game, the handling of their community, and the growth of the game as an esport. 

Balancing: With each new champion arriving on the "Battleground of the Gods", I've always been scared of what monster Hirez has cooked up and their implementation of the new god into the game. After having lasting through releases of characters who dominated the casual queues from the instance of their arrivals into the game such as Artyo, Cernunnos, or even Bellona, Camazotz, Thoth, or Terra (god forbid a god release like Terra happens again), the only time the game comes even close to being balanced is after a patch that doesn't include a new god - or, if a new god is launched into the game with enormous amounts of nerfs. Hirez is REALLY awful about this - they put new characters into a game that dominate all of the casual queues for the next two weeks until the next patch is launched. I can SPECIFICALLY remember quitting the game for a month when Artyo was released because she was so overwhelming and aggravating to play against, and other circumstances where I quit for weeks at a time upon the release of gods like Thoth or Terra. Hirez has absolutely NO CLUE how to properly launch a god into the game, and ruins the experience of her playerbase by refusing to undo what they've done for weeks at a time. They have such an awful mentality that once something is put into the game, it shouldn't be removed; the item Fatalis, for instance, was in the game for FIVE years before finally being split into several less powerful items and removed from the game within the last year. They have never possessed the ability to launch new gods or items without a plethora of new issues, glitches, or balancing problems with each new implementation. They also think every new god has to be their own special snowflake; simple kids do not exist in gods anymore. Every new god must have at least 2 forms of CC, 3 damaging abilities, a very unique passive that works with their abilities, or an ultimate that works with all of their abilities. I'm not saying that creativity and trying new things is bad; Hirez just releases gods that are so bloated and broken that even when they are nerfed, they are still the best characters in the game. If you look at this tier list (http://smite.guru/tierlists/l/JD), pulled from a popular community website, out of the five best characters in the game, three were released within the last few months. This is astounding - with a god pool of 92 characters, why is it that characters so recently released are without a doubt the best in the game? Now look at the bottom of the list - EVERY CHARACTER EXCEPT TWO in the A-, B, or C tiers was one of the first 30 gods that released into the game, with the exception of (I believe) Camazotz and Ah Puch. Hirez has absolutely no idea how to balance the old with the new, and comes out with a new and broken god complete with new and broken items on the regular. Honestly, a random-number-generator would be better at balancing item stats and god ability damages than Hirez. 

COMMUNITY AND ESPORT: The way in which Hirez interacts with their community and their transition of the game into an esport has several linking issues, so I'll talk about them both. Hirez has absolutely no respect for the voices of their competitive players or for the voices of their community. If you refer to Hirez's employee reviews on glassdoor (https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Hi-Rez-Studios-Reviews-E200165.htm), you can easily see that the real, negative reviews of the bad management of the company entirely outnumber the fake, 5 star reviews of anonymous accounts. These negative reviews fit exactly with my perspective of the company; the employees are great, but they get out when they can because the overwhelming (and sometimes underwhelming) presence and pressures of the erractic CEO and headstaff are so AWFUL. THE GAME WAS BUILT AWESOME  BY AWESOME EMPLOYEES; however, these employees are gone, and with good reason. With the loss of community heads Bart and Kelly, Smite has dissolved into Chest Opening Simulator 2017 and Cosmetics Purchasing Simulator 2017. Their disregard for the LATAM and Oceanic competitive scenes as well as the overall competitive scene has shown the inability of the higher-ups in the company to be able to keep Smite at the peak level it once was. Smite peaked in 2013 and early 2014 - the Smite Launch Tournament, which was croud-funded by the Odyssey, had a prize pool of 2.3 million dollars - the third greatest Esports prize pool at the time. With each subsequent year, the tournament prize pool has decreased as Hirez's game has begun to die and they've become greedier and greedier. This year, the number of cosmetics and items released in the Odyssey have increased in price and in number are far more than what they were three years ago. THIS IS A PROBLEM. The Odyssey was established as a way to make money for the Smite World Championship every year, yet after a successful first year they decided to cap the winnings for the tourament at $1 million dollars? What happened to the rest of the money from the Odyssey that was spent on in game items and cosmetics? It went right into the pocket of the greedy heads of Hirez, when it should have gone to things like the establishment of MORE and BETTER dedicated servers for games, bug fixes, competitive prize pools, balancing, and other items the community has been begging for for YEARS and Hirez has continued to ignore them. The worst part of all this? Six months ago, Hirez came out and RECOGNIZED their flaws, fixed one or two, and claimed to be working on the rest. The game still sucks, Hirez?!?!? Where did you go???

Hirez is NOT a good company, and they have absolutely no potential to allow such an amazing game to grow as long as idiots are at the helm. SMITE peaked in 2013 and 2014. Every subsequent year has been a disappointment, and after a complete disregard for the community and competitive scene as well as a complete failure to balance the game, I'm finally done with Smite. 

If you're looking to play it casually with a friend every now and then, go for it! But it's not a game you can have fun with in the long haul; it'll just disappoint you in the end.
PSA: Don't use an older overclocked cpu with Windows 8-10, it'll cause bugs in SMITE that'll trigger a permanent ban that will not be lifted.

This is my recent experience with the game. It's not meant to jab at the game itself, but the problems I've dealt with the product and its company. My hours are not accurate and I've played before it was on Steam.

This game has a bug with WIndows 8/8.1/10 where using an older generation CPU like the Lynnfield/Bloomfield processors overclocked (via the FSB, not multiplier) causes your system (Windows TIme) clock to run faster. This in turn also causes syncing issues with games of the Unreal Engine for some bizarre reason. 

Games like Rocket League will cause you to d/c from the match. Games like SMITE that also use the same engine? They will cause you to move faster in game, or just outright give you 300-400ms. I got the latter, thankfully not the former or at least that's what I think, rubberbanded a lot, too. I reported this on their feedback page, unaware of the Windows 8/8.1/10 problem because I've been on Windows 7 until three weeks ago.

Nonetheless, this problem flags their anticheat, permanently banning you. If you get banned by this system, there's no way out, they don't care, unless you take it to the subreddit and call them out. Unfortunately, /r/Smite now has rules against this type of behavior, so have fun trying to get things addressed with Hirez support. I was banned. My friend is friends with HirezTom and he told him to tell me to send in a support ticket and it'll be resolved, no problem. I was relieved, I thought to myself, hey if this guy is nice about it, I'm sure the support team will also care and try to help me figure out what went wrong.

No. That's not what happened at all. I left a ticket, sent in various screenshots, unaware of this cpu bug. I verified and proven my Windows 10 install and everything on my PC was fresh, brand new, basically. This leads to me my first problem, I was given a "eula copypasta" saying I used software to modify the game, indicating they didn't even bother to read my ticket.

Their support team will give you a copypasta "no" response, guaranteed. Look at their forums, there's a thread with over 5 pages about the Overclock ban and how they all got the same automated response. 

They won't talk to you, they treat you as a robot. They will close your ticket if you re-open it, and if you're persistent about wanting to talk to an actual person, they'll ban your customer support account. It's a known problem with HiRez and I've supported them since the Global Agenda days because I never ran into these issues until I was forced to install Windows 10. I've played this game before playing through the launcher on Steam, hence my low hours.

The game has gone through subtle changes over the years and I'm sure it'll still be popular. But obviously I can't recommend the game due to their subpar customer support that makes even Steam Support look like a top-notch customer support service.

It's a slap in the face to not communicate with dissatisfied customers and players of their product.

If I ever do pick up this game again or any of their games, I probably won't be spending money on any of their microtransactions. I bought stuff like skins because they were nice and it supports the company. I can't support a company I wanted to work for in the past because of how poorly they treated their customers.

If you have fun in this game, that's great, It's a fun game, nice community compared to Dota and LoL. The product itself isn't bad, it's the people behind the product that makes me not recommend this game.

________________


EDIT 2/6/16-2/7/16: Thank you, everyone for liking and upvoting this review so it gets higher on the Community Hub in hopes that a developer or some Hi-Rez staff will see this. 

I also use f.lux and that is a program that tampers with my hue lighting to get dimmer as the day goes on, I have eye fatigue and I've used it along with Smite for years without problems.

I wanted to clarify that I am aware that Hi-Rez treats their community very fondly in regards to balancing the game and suggestions to the game. But that's completely different from how they handle bans and how they handle customers who are afraid and anxious from false/questionable bans. They don't re-assure them at all and they make their fears of being permanently banned - a reality by sending them a nonsensical copy and paste "you broke the eula" when they want to talk to a representative about why or what happened and how they can resolve the issue. 

I shouldn't need to be a famous person, a streamer, or someone "relevant" to get unfair advantages in the system. I expect to be treated like a human being, who has been patient, and wants to talk to a representative of the company to resolve technical problems that I've been addressing through their feedback after matches and on the support page. I left that on my support ticket about me leaving constant feedback, screenshots, tons of things about my problems. I was given a "you used malicious software and broke our eula" when I've stated and proved that I have a relatively new computer with little to no software besides an antivirus, Smite, and other steam games.

I do have friends that are in contact with Hi-Rez, some work with them and help test Paladins, some are family of workers. Nonetheless, I shouldn't be needing to ask them for favors like "Can you get someone to actually read my ticket before they send a copy and paste response that is totally irrelevant to my case? I have a fresh Windows 10 install, I can't have any type of malicious software." It was from one of my friends who contacted a Hi-Rez employee that I learned about the overclocking bug that can result in a glitched engine or higher ping, not from anyone on the Hi-Rez support page/email. That's saying something. That's saying there's a clear lack of communication between the dissatisfied, upset customer and the customer tech support, whose job is supposed to communicate with people. Still, at the end of the day, the company is there to make profit. Losing me won't equate to anything. But if I equate to nothing, shouldn't that mean that I should be unbanned instead of playing frogger so that my voice can be heard?

I'm a head administrator of a fairly decent sized Garry's Mod server, I'm a Wikia administrator, I've been a forum customer support for Invisionfree. I know how Customer Support works, I've been in three or more positions and I know communication is key for fellow co-workers and clients. This lack of communication from Hi-Rez's customer support needs to be addressed. 

Dozens of players have been banned by a similar issue like mine. We're not informed of it by customer support, we're left in the dark and we get our answers from google searches because they're apparently more reliable and gives us the answers we want to our questions. Copy and pasting is not helpful. You already have a FAQ, people send tickets because they want an actual person to respond and help them assess their situation.

I stand by my story that my ban was a mistake. Banning because of overclocked cpus and their operating system not working intended on your engine is a fault on Microsoft's and the company. You already have a fix by "banning players", but you can always take the Rocket League approach and just disconnect the player or kick them. It'd solve a ton of headaches for the customer support who have to go through these tickets and it'd mean less banned players to be really frustrated that the customer support just wants their paycheck and will find the easiest possible method of "answering" people's tickets.

Edit 2-7-16:

We've hit 50/50 (100%) ratio, that's rare. Thanks so much for the support to those who took the time to read this. Shows a lot about the community and their support.
I used to love this game. It was very good in Season 3, but then came Season 4 and everything changed. In Season 4, Hi-Rez realised "we don't need to care about the game, we only need to care about the money". So they started to release lots of very good lookin new skins (in my opinion smite skins are the best looking skins of all mobas), but skins won't balance a game. With season 4 started the tank meta, so everyone was just playing Guardians and Warriors. If you looked at the esl, mostly tanks were played, too. It was a pain in the ass if you wanted to have fun with other gods too. But the good thing was that not many people cared about the meta in casual modes. As Season 4 ended the new Tier5 skin for Ullr was announced and as we know Hi-Rez, they realised the chance of making a fuck ton of money. So they buffed Ullr extremely, so everybody wanted to play him and everybody wanted the new skin for their "main". After the release of the Tier5 Ullr got nerfed pretty fast, because this skin was limited and Hi-Rez has made their money. The tank meta got a bit controlled with some new patches, changing items and nerfing tank abilities. We are now at the start of Season 5, February 2018. Everything was ok-ish. Bugs started to spread over Smite, first only some visual bugs, some of them very funny. But then it got worse with each single patch. The bugs started to affect god abilities, game's latency and some minor other stuff. Hi-Rez releases a patch each 2 weeks. So the bugs started to spread very fast. I'm writing this review on 4 May 2018 and I can tell that I have never played a game before, which was as buggy as Smite. Look at my Steam Library, I played a bunch of games. But bugs are only one of our problems, there were more. The tank meta started to come back with new Guardians and Warriors in the god releases, so tanks did more dmg than any other class while being more tanky and having more Crowd Control than any other class. Now everyone was obsessed by the meta. Of about 95 gods in the game, only 20 were played (you actually saw only 20 different gods in like 10 matches until you saw a non-meta god). This is a huge problem in my opinion, because if you like to play a god, you can't play him, because he's not in the meta and no matter how good you are, you will play worse than you could. This resulted in a heavy harassment wave. If you didn't pick a meta god, you would get flamed, reported etc. (mostly in Russian, because this game has a big russian community, I myself learned to understand the Russian language because of Smite, so it's good if you try to learn russian). Know you probably think: But Xovio, this only happens in the high elo. I can tell you that you're absolutely wrong, because there is no thing called "elo" in Smite. "You just started the game? Here are people who played the game for 500+ hours to help you get started" "You lost 14 matches in a row? Maybe if you fight against people with 2000+ you'll learn how to play it!" It's not fun for the experienced players, neither is it fun for the new players.

And now we should look at what Hi-Rez did against these problems:

They released new skins and cosmetics to buy.


Good evening guys!
Having played this game for well over a year, it saddens me that I cannot ask my friends who play other MOBAs to play this. At its current state, Smite is an embarrassment.

[b]Greedy cashgrabbing assholes:[/b] Hi-Rez milked the Smite cow for all of its money by spitting out about 5+ skins with each weekly patch, whereas glaring glitches, bugs and imbalances remained untouched for months. For example, we had an extra Jungle Practice mode, which when clicked on, did nothing. Scrolling with the mouse wheel on the god page hardly ever works. The UI accidentally got skewed and shrunk by default. Nobody bothered to fix all of this shit, but Hi-Rez was quick to release pretty skins instead. The money made from skins is not used to make the game better or even fund the game's eSports scene. Instead, Hi-Rez raised 100.000$ through Smite skin sales for a tournament for their new cashgrab battle royale game, featuring fucking KEEMSTAR!

[b]Balance by 3rd graders:[/b] Some gods are legitimately broken and are not balanced simply because they are popular, aka people get more skins for them. When a really good, super rare skin is released for a god, that god is overtuned and made OP so people have more incentive to buy that very expensive skin for him/her. Other gods are unpopular and so remained untouched by balance changes or skins for more than half a year. The PTS server is either broken or ignored, so broken shit makes it live constantly, then Hi-Rez has to spend 3 patches trying to fix the obvious.

[b]Matchmaking is hot garbage:[/b] More often than not, having played over 1000hr (in-game time), I still get matched with or against people who have played no more than 10% of my own playtime. The matchmaking system is built to force you in a 50% win/loss ratio. As such, if you get very good, you will suddenly have beginner teammates and diamond level enemies, so that you will be forced to lose. If you are losing too much, you will get matched against noobs that you can stomp. Lately, very rarely have I felt that my win or loss was well-earned.

[b]Why I still play:[/b] The game, at its core, is actually pretty awesome. Gameplay is fun, third-person perspective is interesting, most gods are cool and fun to play. I just wish Hi-Rez sold Smite to a company that actually cares. It has the potential to be one of the most popular games of all time.
Game not working anymore for a lot of my friends and me and a lot of people complain but they haven't fixed it for serveral updates now

it just freezes when you try to launch it
Smite is a decent game. It has a fair share of problems, including matchmaking, but what multiplayer game doesn't?
I love the way it plays, I love it's characters and I love the cosmetics in this game. In the end, this is the only MOBA that I still even play, and haven't uninstalled for years.

However, the time to uninstall may have come.

Hi-Rez decided suddenly, without any notices or warnings, to increase the price of gems (in-game currency) by about 2 times in my country and a few others.
And after a brief discussion with support about the reasons, turns out, it was a concious decision on their part. They simply screwed a huge part of their playerbase, and the only reason they gave is "exchange rate". Well, let me tell you right now, that exchange rate of Dollar to Rouble did not change noticeably for years. And definitely did not suddenly double. And the price of gems has stayed the same since at the very least 2016. You can google the exchange rate for 2016-2018 yourself if you do not believe me.

Such practices are straight up unacceptable. Not only did this doubling the prices screw the affected players in the long run, for obvious reasons, but it also screwed us in the short run, since they did it in the middle of their "Divine Uprising" event. For those that don't know, events like these require you to pay for and spend gems during the lifetime of event, that usually lasts for months, so in the end you can get a fancy exclusive skin. So those of us who already spent some money to get the delicious Tier 5 skin are now doubly screwed. We either have to pay their increased prices to get it, or mourn the loss of money we've already invested, because paying double is ridiculous. 

This horrible, predatory decision is borderline a fraud on their part. And my favorite MOBA, that I have spent a lot of time and money in, is now, without exaggeration, dead to me. There is no way I will ever spend money or otherwise support anything this company does from now on.
This review will be split up in categories, to show how good each section of the game is. In each category I will shortly explain each of the points.

[u] THE VERY GOOD [/u]
- Very satisfying gameplay. The way you control your god feels very good and can be quite fun, even after many hours. Even though the core elements of a MOBA are still there, it feels like a 3rd person action game, which means it appeals to both fans of the MOBA genre and people who want a cool, fun experience.
- Interesting representation of ancient gods. For me it is commendable that they managed to present gods from 9 different pantheons (as of now) with a lot of detail, having a somewhat accurate appearance, a lore feature which allows players to read the backrounds of all gods and encourages some of them to look for more details. At the same time, Hi-Rez is not afraid to release skins that are definately not faithful to the mythology, but are meant to be simply cool.
- Extremely well made sountrack. Even though some of the tracks in Smite are variations of the same theme, they managed to make them in a way to go for a different touch in each version, depending on the pantheon. Still, leaving those aside, the game has a lot of high quality themes that fit the tone of the game and in fact can be appreciated even by outsiders.
- Outstanding in-game chat. The text chat is nothing special, but the voice chat is really convenient. During Smite matches you can open your voice menu (using the V button) and quickly find different messages like "Enemies in the right lane", "Be right back" etc that are read for your whole team to hear. Needless to say, this is a great feature that helps speed up the process of communicating with your team.

[u] THE GOOD [/u]
- Nice visuals and level of graphics. Considering this is a free to play title, from a visual standpoint this game has succeded. The god models look pretty good, the environments have some detail, textures are (almost) always clear and in general it seems satisfying to look at.
- Good application of the free to play model. This is one the rare occasions where a game that is free to play does not depend on spending either money or insane amounts of grind to compete with other players. In order for you to be competitive, all you need to have is the required skill necessary. That being said, you do depend on your teamates as well, but nevertheless if you are good enough you will at least guarantee that you will do your part sufficiently.
- Leniency in collecting in-game currrencies. This game uses two types of currency, favor, which is mostly obtained through winning matches and gems, which are mostly obtained through paying real money. There are bonuses for getting those currencies, like free favor/gems for logging in on consecutive days or for completing daily quests. That allows players to collect gods/skins in a shorter period of time without having to play all day. It should also be noted that there is the Ultimate God Pack, a feature that unlocks all current and future gods for around 20-25 euros/dollars (price varies depending on where you live). Although getting every god is not necessary to play the game, having every single one that is out or will be out for that amount of money is a good deal.
- A variety of game modes. There are 6 different maps (with the corresponding practice and co-op modes), as well as a Match of the Day feature that, as the name suggests, changes every day and is inspired by recommendations of the community. Naturally, there are also 3 ranked modes on these maps (Conquest 5v5, Joust 3v3 and Joust 1v1). The different layout of the lanes, the towers and the camps in those maps means you can alternate between them and reduces fatigue.
- Well designed watching option. In the "Wisdom" tab, you can quickly find current Smite streams or god guides and watch them while the game is running. Granted, you could just open your internet browser and search it there, but it is a neat feature which should be mentioned. Also, the spectating mode is pretty handy.

[u] THE MEH [/u]
- The community. This is not the worst community in any game (it is FAR from that), but at times the playerbase can get pretty bad. As I mentioned earlier, the game has a voice chat available, which can be spammed a lot when people are upset. This creates issues, since you don't want to listen to pointless messages, but at the same time muting the player completely can cause you to miss important warnings. Not to mention the intentional feeders/leavers/blamers that are matched with you from time to time. Overall, it is better than many games and probably better than most MOBAs out there, but still the room for improval is there.
- The matchmaking. Sometimes, in order for Smite to find players to match against one another, it has to expand the window of matchmaking between players. Simply put, in normal matches there is a chance you could be matched with players way higher or lower than you in terms of skill. Not only does this make certain matches very unbalanced, but it creates another problem. Punishments for leaving god selections are very severe, because making it more bothersome when people leave in god selection discourages that behavior, thus decreasing the chances of leaving and the time people need to find a game. Unfortunately, when you find teamates in normal games that picked a weird team you don't want to spend time playing with you have to consider staying and potentially wasting your time or leaving and risking at best a big duration as a deserter or at worst a ban. I have even heard that someone got banned once for not clicking accept in time when a match was found.
- The balancing. In comparison to other competitive games with multiple characters, it is relatively better in that regard, but still, for most of the gods what occurs is going through a period of time of mediocrity, then receiving a buff and becoming pretty strong and then maybe a nerf that brings them back to their original stats (or even lower). I am aware that you can make up for some of the god's weaknesses with a certain level of skill, however when the opponent's skill level matches yours and he/she is using a more viable god you are at a slight disadvantage from the start.

[u] THE BAD [/u]
- The servers. Servers in Smite have been unstable as long as I can remember them. Lag spikes and disconnects are issues that happen from time to time in games (not very often but on occasion). If I am not mistaken, this issue has been mitigated over the years, but it remains one of the most important ones, as you will get a disconnect from a game because of the servers around once every month.

[u] THE VERY BAD [/u]
- The recent implementation of Easy Anti Cheat (EAC). EAC is known in the field of gaming to be a big failure of an anti-cheat software. It is riddled with problems, such as not allowing the game to run if you have unsigned drivers, disconnecting players for no reason, banning more innocent players than cheaters (which combined with the irreversible nature of the bans is an awful issue), failure to even stop all cheaters, having properties of actual spyware. Even though the community complained, Hi-Rez included EAC in a recent patch and unsurprisingly, a huge amount of people reporting having trouble with the game since, even though most of them were not cheaters. History proved that EAC was disastrous in other games in which it was implemented (the stories regarding For Honor were even worse) and it was proven very bad in Smite as well.

[b] SUMMARY [/b]
I was really torn about this decision, because I really, REALLY wanted to recommend Smite, since I've had a lot of fun with this game. However, I decided in the end not to recommend it as the existance of EAC is so menacing that it counteracts all of the advantages Smite has (even though they are greater in number). If EAC is ever removed - highly unlikely - this game would unquestionably be recommended.
I am now playing this game since its closed beta ... long before its steam days. I had a lot of fun with it but especially recently I must sadly say that the development and direction in which this game seems to go is kinda dissapointing.
This review is my personal opinion but I try to stay as unbiased as possible

Pros:
+ Its a good MOBA with a - for MOBA standards - different approach to the controls (but in a good way)
+ It has a very well designed Item and leveling system
+ It offers a variety of "gamemodes" (a welcome change in a MOBA)
+ Nice diversity of champs / gods to play with
+ Nice graphics (for its respectively style of course)
+ Its free
+ Active community (also on Youtube/ Twitch etc)

Cons:
- The matchmaking is rather wild (either you stomp or you get stomped -> around 10%ish balanced games)
- The Skins are rather expensive
- Lootboxes (I just dont like to have to get 10 skins while I only want one of them in general)
- The que times of some modes are really long nowadays (7 minutes? no thank you - yes I am looking at you siege)
- New relesed gods are usually broken as sh** and some gods are just so op that they will have a 80% pickrate for the entire season (1 season = 1 year divided in 3 splits -> Spring Summer Fall)
- The community sometimes feels like the devs dont care anymore (they do but they react to problems 3 months later or so)
- Some bugs stay for months even years in the game (we had 2 practice mode buttons for over a year and one never worked)
- They decided to streamline all clients to the console layout which is a disaster for PC players (update from 19.12.2018)

Summary: I really like it...I probably left like 100ish buchs in the game to support the devs over the years. BUT its starting to piss me off, that the same issues repeat themselfes and suck the fun out of the game.

I will consider giving a thumbs up should the "old" PC-hud return but until then I will have to give this game a negative review because after all those years I still see the same issues it alwys had so there is no real development even though the devs seem to try and at the same time I see some changes slowly killing the fun of the game :(

I like Smite, I have 1000+ hours played on the Steam release and more from Pre-Steam, but it's quite frankly a terrible game for a myriad of reasons. Hi-Rez as a company has made it pretty clear through their business practices that they care far more about making money than they do making an enjoyable/balanced game. Before I state what's bad about the game I'll talk about the very few things that are good.

Good:

The game uses the fairly standard at this point paying for Characters pay model with cosmetic optional purchases. The game offers a wonderful "God Pack" for $30 which includes all the gameplay relevant content as a single one-time purchase, this is great and if you can't have have everything free like Valve's F2P games or have the process of unlocking characters a core part of the game like Warframe than this is a great way to do it.

The general gameplay is quite fun, the game has a stupid pride of stating that everything is a skill shot but honestly that's a load of bull. Yes you have to land your basic attacks, but a large majority of the "skill shots" in this game have massive targeters and are stupid easy to hit. I'm not talking about the balance of the game's Gods/Items, I'm talking purely at a fundamental level, I think the gameplay of Smite is fun.

Mythology is a key feature of Smite, I absolutely love seeing all these different mythologies mixed together, especially Norse, Chinese and Shinto. I don't always like Hi-Rez's depictions of these Gods and Goddesses but still it's cool and was the main reason I gave the game a shot.

Bad: 

Exclusives/Limited Content is all over the place in this game, if you're new to the game, good luck finding any skins that aren't Exclusive or Limited. Again this content is entirely cosmetic and has no effect on the gameplay, but the amount of time Updates are devoted almost entirely on skins is insane especially considering most of it is incredibly overpriced, requires you purchasing multiple other things you don't actually want or locked behind RNG chest. Yes Smite relies heavily on F2P Lootboxes, more than 60% of the Skins currently in Smite are locked behind lootboxes.

EDIT: I wanted to add on to what I said above about updates devoting time to the skins. The game is INSANELY buggy, par for the course for MOBAs with so many moving parts. The problem is how even the smallest of bugs go unfixed for months and even larger ones STILL aren't fixed after years. These bugs range from tiny UI glitches to gamebreaking. They almost never spend enough time fixing these problems, instead focusing on selling you skins cause fixing the game isn't as sexy as another Exclusive/Limited Nu Wa or Neith skin.

Hi-Rez as a company are honestly incredibly disrespectful, many of their employees are active on Twitter, Reddit, etc and will openly mock the players for suggestions and criticism. One of their former employees, left the company after the community was outraged by their statement about suicide and depression. Now I'm not saying the company as a whole is terrible, there's probably plenty of great people working on this game, it's just a lot of the time they've come off as extremely unprofessional.

Game balance is a mess, Hi-Rez relies mostly on "data" when balancing the game. The game has multiple modes, with Arena being the most popular, but Conquest being the standard 3-lane "MOBA" mode which is the one the game balances around. Win rates of Gods is far more important than how they're performing in the Competitive Pro scene. Some Gods are absolutely garbage in Pro, but annoying/unfun in casual play.

Anyways I'm ranting on about personal gripes with the game at this point. So no I don't recommend Smite, there are much better games out there to spend your time and money on. I don't write these reviews often so understand I'm being genuine when I say I think this game is not good, again I have 1000+ hours in it because I'm a terrible person who hates myself.
They still haven't fixed the issue where people in EU struggle to login, and there have been alot of issues the last few patches that the game freezes on launch.
Right now it is unplayable in most of EU.
So first of I'd like to begin by saying while my hours in this game are pretty steep compared to most other players; I have only been playing for an entire year and one month at the time of writing this. I've been tossing around the idea of writing a review for this game over a couple months now and today I'm finally deciding to do it.

I've really got to nod Hi-Rez for the Clan System (Pretty much guilds), Simple but effective. This game has given me a chance to meet so of the most wonderful people I've ever experienced but at the same time, never have I experienced a community quite this toxic since LoL (League of Legends) over two years ago. I assume it's still the same but I digress. 
Only once in my life can I recall being this close to a group of people ever. Winging, Glacy, Stupid Thicc(Now EmperorOppai), Stoopid Thicc(Now TheWildSnapple), Frog, Ezra, Raito Kirigi,  If and I hope you are reading this; Thank you so much for the best year that I've ever experienced so far in my life and I pray that we can continue on like this

Now onto the tough part, BALANCE.
This game takes balance to a whole new level, it's pretty topsy turvey if you ask me but anyways; Most of the gods in the game will either feel completely busted or this awkward middle ground like limbo. Most of them just need some fine tuning here and there but others OH BOY don't even get me started. Sadly I don't know how Hi-rez functions as a company when it comes to SMITE and things in it like balance and skins; However, I can say that I've always felt like there was some sort of personal biased towards certain gods such as Bacchus, and Cupid; then a different biased to other gods such as Zhong Kui, and Kumbahkarna. This can be negligence or just pure infautation with these gods, this is for you to determine cause I see both sides personally.

Ranked is a clown fiesta, no matter where you go you see the same gods all the time no matter the amount of nerfing that goes into a go for example Cu Chuliann has been nerfed after nerfed and yet it still remains at the top of the warriors, on the other hand there is certain gods who haven't seen pro level play within years such as Aphrodite but yet as soon as she 
rises in popularity she is nerfed. For as long as I've been playing you will see the same gods in the ban list and see the same gods in lane; You'll see Thoth Mid, Cherobog Adc, Ganesha Support, Cu Chuliann Solo, and Thor Jungle then the enemy team trying to find some way of combatting those gods. Very rarely will you see the god meta change; Items decide who is the strongest for the majority of the gods but there are some buffs that completely throw the god off the handle such as Ullr.

Hi-Rez as a company has made some "questionable" choices since I've started playing SMITE and most of the reviews you'll read about this game are pretty much this "Great Game, Terrible Company" Now while I'm not defending Hi-Rez I'm certainly not throwing them completely under the bus; All I can really say for this is give the game a shot despite what you are reading currently. This game has the infamous "loot box" system where certain (Now pretty much everything) is locked behind a randomize paywall forcing you to take a chance on something you'd want; Yes we all know skins are not required to play the game but when there is something that you'd pay money for and it's locked behind a roulette, that's really freaking frustrating. Hi-Rez has even gone as far as to buff a god to sell a skin; please keep in mind that this god was generally seen as strong on all levels of play be it bronze or masters. So as I've said before very shady business practices but I'm sure they are all wonderful people and this is just one persons slip-up or something to that effect.

Hi-Rez has also made so very poor legal decisions and when I say legal desicisons I mean how they work with they're employee's; One case that has happened very recently is Youtuber Mythymoo and PunkDuck hosted a patch review show that was usually no longer then like 4 minutes but Mythymoo had created a video called "Four years later" in which he states that he wouldn't recommend SMITE as a game to anyone so Hi-Rez said they wouldn't renew his contract so he was forced to quit. Obviously I can't speak for him but all I know is what he being Mythymoo has made public via Twitter or his own Youtube account. PunkDuck still does the patch notes review but now by himself so as I've stated before take of that of what you will.
The core gameplay of SMITE is incredibly fun. However, HiRez has a really bad habit of introducing game-breaking bugs after updates. The latest update features game disconnects (entire team), UI that doesn't work so I can't claim rewards, and features of the game stop working like rerolling in the ARAM gamemode. I get the impression that HiRez doesn't take this game seriously. They push out low quality patches with lots of new $$$ content.

Update: They broke the party system. You can be in party, queue up, then enter a game without your party members. What a joke.
The game itself is great, but for about a month as of posting this review the game is pretty much unplayable to a lot of people in the EU.

Instead of providing some explanation, or making some kind of announcement, HiRez went full radio-silence mode, only giving people advice on personal basis via support. None of their advice seemed to help people, mind you.

HiRez as a company has a long history of neglecting issues for longest periods of time, but I sincerely thought that the game has been getting better than ever with every new patch for a while now. It's a real shame there is no way to play it now. 

This is a really shameful display of utmost incompetence that people hate HiRez for.
After the last patch, me and my friends from Europe cannot login into Smite, just freezes on "game data" or loading screen. Hi-rez didn't even acknowledge that something is fundamentally broken, no news from them. Tens of thousands of folk cannot even launch the game. That aside, the game is not worth playing anymore, they just keep launching skins and shit like that, but forget to focus on balancing match making, fixing bugs, etc. No wonder the reviews are going down, if Hi-rez doesn't give a damn about it's players, that it will go down the hill pretty soon.
If you live in Europe around Denmark and east towards Russia, you can't launch the game without it freezing at the launch screen, after the latest update. Rendering you unable to play the game.

Customer support's only advise: get a VPN.

No official statements from any Hi-Rez representatives on twitter, reddit or the offical forums. And general ignorance towards the issue from the studio as a whole.

The issue has been around for weeks now, but could be brute forced through with about 20 launches/shut downs in a row. Now that doesn't work anymore and the game is completely unplayable for a large portion of the European playerbase.
The last month or maby more it is freezening on "Hi-Rez" advertisement screen,  If they had just taken some responsibility for their problems I would have had sympathy for them if they only  said that '' we are having problems, we are sorry'', but nothing. instead they blame our internet providers and says that the solution is to download a third party VPN program, which still does not work for everyone.
OK so I have more than 1000 hours on this game, a lot of which are on my mac (i know, sorry lol). However, they just yeeted it away from us mac os users with 6.1. I am not happy at all, and I can't play the game at all anymore. Thanks Hi-rez, you pieces of shit
Game's kinda good. Been playing it for a few years and in terms of content, it's pretty cool. But i just uninstalled it because of the only major issue: the matchmaking. I know people is going to say: it's a moba and you're playing with other people; but trust me, the matchmaking is one of the worst i've seen in my entire life. i don't think i'm  coming back to this game, unless they try to fix it, instead of just selling skins
Im officially done. I am ticked off and angry for the final time. I have had enough of this game.
Playing smite is like having an abusive relationship. You have fun the first year or two, but then you start to see the real side of smite. But the nostalgia and fun from the first year keeps you playing, and you keep telling yourself "it will be better" and that they will fix it. But all they have done so far is ignore you and break the game.  Theres no actual support in this game, reporting doesnt do anything. The developers dont care as long as people buy their overpriced random chest rolls for skins. So im done. I do not recommend this game, It is very addicting, and you will tell yourself its great at first. But in the end it will only get gradually worse, cause the developers spends more time making skins than they do actually listening to their fanbase.
Game barely ever launches without any issue. When is does launch, you try to Queue up and nothing happens, no timer or anything. Then once you manage to get in a lobby, game freezes. You get punished and then BAM, 30 minute deserter penalty... not 5 minutes... 30 freaking minutes.
Look at my hours. Probably put more than $1000 in as well. Cannot find a match with crossplay disabled, the game is literally unplayable. Played with it on and it had ruined every game I've played. No comms, rampant trolling and d/c's like I've never experienced. Introduced a new way to give them your money though, so that's...something. I'm pretty positive this will be the reason I quit playing, and just wanted to give a heads up to others on the downward trajectory.
The game is kind of fun, but I have been unable to log in since the latest patch.  It does not matter if the game is good if you are unable to play it.
So I've played and supported this game for many years, many seasons, played it lots and lots with my friends as it was the only game we really had to play together. 
The game has always had its flaws but let's face it, no game is perfect. But things have gotten worse and worse at a steady pace, each patch would be followed with an increasing amount of glitches/bugs. 
For a couple of weeks now I've had to try to log in about 10-20 times before the game would actually let me in and then boom, now I can't log in at all.
I'm writing this review as a protest until they solve the current problems, this was just beyond awful and unprofessional. Out of all the patches they've released they have never managed to ruin things this badly.
HiRez, u r killing your game, after your patch it crashes on start. I couldn't play for 2 weeks already: game crashes.
Where is your reaction? Wtf are u doing?

I have 3k hours in this game, so there is no need to say I love Smite, but now its just impossible to play. Dont waste your time to download: U WILL NOT EVEN SEE THE MENU.
Loved SMITE. Fun game..

Lately however.. game seems really bad. Admitted when it works.. its still fun. But if your from the EU (east or west) then DON'T waste your time! At least til they fix the login issues that mean's you cant even get into the game!

Never had issues with crashing.. or lag. Now however.. its not uncommon. ONLY thing that's changed is SMITE (updates)
And when you ask support for help.. you get the same old robot reply... translated into:
"We don't give shit about you.. just give us your computer spec's so we can pretend to look into it."
(even when you write them you already spoken to support and what you been through.. still the same robot)

I don't know what changed.. game used to be awesome.. look at the reviews.. over all really positive... lately its "Meh" which basicly translates into: "the game became SHIT."

Don't waste your time. Its not worth it.. at least not til Hi-Rez goes back to how it was before.. back when they cared.. back when the game worked.
i like smite a lot only in the last update they deleted the possibility to play it on a mac i would like to see it changed back so me and my friends can play again
This game used to be amazing. One of the most fun games ever, in fact.

With the mix of poor balance decisions, lazy server management, buggy updates and boring or frustrating god releases, this game has gone downhill.

Their latest god has TEN abilities, opposed to the usual 4 - and EVERY ONE of these abilities is better than other gods' ULTIMATES - or offers more utility than the strongest items.
Not only in the eu, but also in China, users will not be able to log in to the game after the update.There was no announcement or explanation from the game company.If the company doesn't pay attention to global users, sooner or later it will go downhill.不仅在欧盟，在中国，更新后的游戏将无法登陆。游戏公司没有发布任何声明或解释。如果公司不关注全球用户，迟早会走下坡路。euだけでなく、中国では、アップデートされたゲームの登录ができない。ゲーム会社は何の声明や説明も出していない。会社がグローバル・ユーザーに注目しなければ,遅かれ早かれ下降線をたどるだろう。
Game is so unbalanced and matchmaking is horrible. Hi-rez literally dont care about this game anymore and just want your money from buying mediocre skins from chests.

Update: Since last patch,the servers have been so buggy that almost every other game their has been a disconnect.
I love Smite. I love playing it...on my mac. But they killed mac play without warning when they added crossplatform play?? I've put good money into this game. Real shitty.
The game freezes all the time when I launch it and it starts "loading game data". Please fix it, I had this issue for more than three weeks now, both Smite and Paladins have exactly the same issue! I can't play them anymore :(
While the core game-play is fantastic, the way players are placed together is questionable. I have found myself against players with considerably more skill than me and find it difficult to find motivation to learn or even play the game. This has been the case for almost everytime I boot up the game and is a huge discouragement. There is nothing wrong with getting your shit pushed in every now and then, but 3/4 matches is a bit much. When this changes I will fix this review, but for now I cant enjoy getting my ass handed to me.
As you can see i´ve invested quite alot of time into this game... let alone Money...
I do enjoy this game... but as of lately i have encountered Issue after Issue, bug after bug...

The game literally became unplayable for me 2 Patches ago, it would just randomly freeze at the opening and crash.
I reinstalled my Visual C++, i did multiple fresh and clean reinstalls of the game (which ofcourse had to be done manually since their Client to do so has been broken for quite a while), i did try to fix the Easy anti Cheat, i ran the game at 32bit, instead of the 64 (which my system should be running it on), all that to no avail and no matter how hard i tried i could not fix the Problem.

Alright, so i did a complete Deinstall, i cleaned the Harddrive it was stored on, and downloaded it via the Launcher... which was patch 5.25 i think... so it did indeed help and worked just fine.... even with better performance... now 3x you can guess, what happened at the release of 6.1?

I now freeze While "loading for game Data" now what does that mean my dear friends ?

Now now first i thought "oh thats wierd, it must be my internet, it must be my Provider" - which is what Hi-Rez support will tell you... now upon calling my Provider, and trying to clear things up, they´ll tell you that the problem is indeed with Hi-Rez and not with them and that they cannot work it out. 

Alright alright that all sounds a bit conspiratorial, and what am i getting at ?
Well the thing is, the Game just isn´t functional... i wish i could play, i wanna play Merlin and i´m happy to invest my money ina  few cool skins here and there, the game is free afterall... but do i wanna invest in it, when i can´t even open the game ? i cannot recommend the game and i can only tell everyone who actually cares about it to make Hi-Rez aware of that bug... from what i´ve been reading, the game has been in a similar state for literally a few patches now...

TL:DR 
THE GAME IS BROKEN RN, FIX YOUR GAME HI-REZ!!!!
I'm not even sure where to start, but ill start by saying I have been playing since beta and my hours wont reflect that because steam integration was way later. Anyways, the reason for my disapproval for smite is the lack of competence from the Hi-Rez customer support. It took 2 weeks and 2 emails to attempt to fix my name which they did not fix and in fact I do not believe they even read either of my emails despite responding presumably not automated the second time; as the first email did not receive a respond and it took the second email to even get a response and that was literally less 30 words. So, with that out of the way I can would like to also state the steady decline the game has had since its release from beta starting with the awful load time from launcher to client (this I suppose is due to "Georgia" or whatever that company is that you see when loading in); either way this same company is also with KF2 which takes a unbearable amount of time to load despite having a SSD. Lastly, for a free to play game it is one of the most expensive in relation to other MOBAs which yes, they are just cosmetics and they have to make money but when seemingly all of the funding goes into skins that are far too overpriced apposed to fixing bugs and errors in game or even balancing issues then why bother spending time when Smite has turned into nothing more than a cash-grab. Now with all that being said I didn't want to go out of my way to make this because I personally do enjoy occasionally playing arena and joust, especially with friends but queue times with multiple people can be a pain and the aforementioned statements I made above, so I can't recommend this game...
Smite freezes up at launch, every single time. Even after I have spent many hours on it, and recently even played today. Cannot find any way to play now. For now, this is a thumbs down. When this is fixed, PLAY IT.
The worst thing to happen to this game is crossplay. Without keyboard/mouse support consoles are at a major disadvantage and whichever team is more heavily PC tends to win.
Matchmaking is utter garbage. New player here, lvl 16 at the time I write this, returned after 2 years of not playing. Getting consistently paired with lvls 60 - 100. In 10 matches, 8 were a loss.
Broken log in system the costumer support is -10/10 but hey Merlin is out . why would we need to fix this game . a lot of people can't log in and they give 0 fk about it
Here's the deal. I played smite for over 3k hours since I moved from Ps4 and it gets very boring quickly. The only way the other players and me have somewhat the mental capacity to continue playing this game is because of the skins. The worst part is that they say that 100 gods are playable, we all know that there is most likely 30 gods that are "meta" and the rest won't get you far at all.
I really enjoyed this game, even to the point where I had invested 100+ hours and spent money on buying skins. Now they removed Mac OS from the picture and I can no longer play. Very frustrating considering this was one of the only games I really enjoyed on Mac.
There does not seem to be any fix for those who get the game stuck and frozen on startups on either Hirez Logo or "Loading - Waiting on game data..."

My temporary fix was restarting until game works but this time I give up, I will not sit and restart for 1h. Might as well quit playing.
I can not play the game wont even start , i have been playing this game for 500+ hours and the game it self is fun but now after a 2 month breake it freezes with and error saying security violation detected 0000001 , i contacted Hi Rez and got and answer that i should try to connect via some vpn-thing , but i really dont wanna change anything as my pc and internet is running really nice right now , i will simply stop playing smite and i do not advise any to buy this game because of many many many freezes and not being able to play/log in. I will also try to get a refund on the character-pack ive spend money on.
They took away victory chests and added a battlepass more expensive than season 5's pass. This game is getting ruined by a greedy company that only cares about the people who buy skins.
Fix all the fucking issues that have been in the game since 2015.
Basic Gold frame cuts off at the bottom
Log in issues
Game instability
Making the community that supports you actually feel like you give a shit
I've been playing this game since they used to give gems for first win of the day..... 
it was great now not so much 
the cartoonish design is not appealing and the maps are ugly, match making is a joke i never got a report however i always end up with AFK players or just toxic kids.
SEA servers are dead and the ping to the nearest region is unbearable. 
i have to lunch the game 4 or 5 times in order to get it working, chat breaks regularly. please do something
Almost 500 hours on this game and I make an account for Paladins. Now I can't get back on my main account. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE A LOGOUT FEATURE! Until this is a thing my review will stand on a thumbs down
Would be nice if it worked, but I guess that's too much to ask for, isn't it? By the way, this problem that only this game has is Windows fault, not Hi-Rez. After all, I saw some random retard on circlejerkddit say it.
Game is just complete and utter shit and hasn't been good in season's. They keep adding new gods instead of fixing the games problems and working out a way to make any game mode other than conquest fun and interesting, 3v3 joust suffers the most from this with the mix of the new trash map, And Most of the real dev time is spent on skins that you can't get.
I've played this game for years and while it is a unique game with interesting mechanics the company behind it has made sure that more than half the time this game is in a state that is terrible to play as a result I have found uninstalling is the best course of action at this time.

Cons:
Matchmaking: (every game is bad at this and with the introduction of crossplay it got so much worse)
Role Queue: might as well not exist as you won't get your role unless you call support and with current matchmaking if 
                     your ADC or Jungle is a bot in skill level the game ends at the pick screen
Unstable Servers: duh
Spectator Client: Broken for years and probably will never improve
VOIP: Never know if its going to work
Chat: Most days the chat window just won't work (likely related to servers)
Patch Day: Take all the above issues crank them up to 11 and you might have an idea of how bad it is

Pros:
God design: at least in season 6 somewhat unique
Camera Angle: 3rd person MOBA makes this game unique 
Somewhat Consumer Friendly: Generally fair price point (Godpack) but its at its least F2P friendly currently (Battlepass)
Balance: Generally Good 


faaak smite, this is a good game, i can't say bad about it. But Hi-rez, is fking up with people.
After every fakin update or maintenance i can't log in to game no matter what, and there seems to be like there's no real error. fk smite. it causes too much nerves.
let me just say that I loved smite. Today they merged the accounts on all platforms, and robbed me of everything that was on my xbox account when it was merged. Got literally none of my skins, favor, or gems. Stole money from me, more or less. Wouldn't recommend this coding catastrophe of a game to anyone at this point.
I'd recommend this game to the majority of gamers that haven't come to terms with top-down team-oriented games such as league of legends, dota 2 etc. Smite focus on characters in third person view and make this a unique experience. 

I do however want to ask people to hold off getting their hands on this FTP (free-to-play) game as Hirez still haven't put their shit together with hot-fixes for the login-freeze bugs which might turn off players already from start.
Love & hate relationship. If you are a free player and don't care for art so much, go for it. But if you appreciate character art, stay far away.

- Business. 

Hi-Rez's business model is all about locking your budget into Smite, and only Smite. They exploit your sense of "missing out" to the most extreme. At least, this is how it feels. If you like cosmetics, you better plan to go for broke. Almost everything about their shop feels awful, it can be very stressful. 

Their loot box system is at a point where it should be considered age 21+ legal gambling.
_____________

- Exclusives

There is a such thing as too much of a good thing. I don't mind paying for cosmetics. I love supporting artists, and I love enjoying their creations. But I can't lock my wallet into Smite indefinitely. I have my own bills to pay, other hobbies. So I miss out on pretty much everything due to the fact I can't throw money at Hi-Rez ASAP. This is a horrible feeling and just causes me to cease support completely. When I miss out on things I want to buy, I have nothing else to support them for.

It's at a point where they need to have some sort of legal action made against them to make them stop, or at least chill out a bit..
_____________

- Performance

It gets worse the longer the game lives. The early days of Smite never had such issues.

Numerous support tickets were made about their poor client performance. They seem to not care about how efficiently their client runs. Numerous DXDiags were sent. All I got was "We sent this to our development team" No 1 on 1 whatsoever.

- Both 32-bit and 64-bit clients take forever to launch. This on a decent system. 4.7 FX8350, 16 GB RAM, both HDD and SSD load at the same speed. My old system had the same issues FX6300 and GTX 450. Had a 512MB Radeon(HD5xxx??) Can't remember. But Both older cards had the same issues. That still persist today. I don't remember which patch started it's sharp decline, but I believe it because after they started working on their 64-bit client.

- Changing the volume will lag both clients

- DX11 hangs if you minimize it

- DX11 glitchy visuals

- DX11 general poor performace/stability

- Even worse performance if you pair 64-bit with DX11.

-(inb4 you tell me to update my drivers)-

I stay up to date on not only GPU, but MOBO and any other system drivers. I read around for any current issues that affect my models. Always prepared to roll-back if required.
_____________

- Art

This game looks so good, A lot of the exclusive skins are really nice if you can get them. There is such a healthy variety of things. It's a shame they hide it behind luck. The skins that are available at any time are not appealing at all. Great if you have favor(earnable ingame currency), but never buy them with Gems (premium paid conversion currency).

You may find some gods are not true to their source. Such as Thanatos, who is supposed to be a benevolent god. In Smite, he is violent. This is a large turn off for me.
_____________

- Gameplay

I do not care for too many modes. the main Conquest mode I do not play. I mainly stick to the Arena mode for fun.

Mode of the Day is a fantastic system. You get to experience the game in often hilarious ways.

God balance is as bad as any other MOBA.

Many different playstyles to choose from. The kits have a fair bit of uniqueness unlike some other MOBA where every character needs at least 3 dash abilities.
_____________

- Community

Meh, At least it's not as bad as League's
I have encountered countless matches with hackers, glitchers, lagswitchers and it has only been a couple of hours. The game was awesome until this problem has shown to be a huge problem around this community, sad that nobody cares enough to fix this.
Absolutely garbage, i logged unto steam and it made me ask my credentials to which I input, didnt work. odd. okay, so forgot password option, AINT WORKING. It's been daayss since I've been trying to send a forgot password email but it just doesn't work. 
Now aside from that, the queues are long, so long! It takes approx 10-15 minutes before a game can start. So mentally tiring to wait that long, and even more so when waiting for a password reset email from Hi Rez. Goodness gracious. 
Now about the gameplay, the only fun thing in this game is the arena mode. Only that. 
The daily quests don't work fine, bugged? I've done the quest and It won't go on. And I can't even get rid of it because guess what, i haven't finished it cos it's bugged!

We hope you enjoyed all the new announcements from Unique Skins Generator Hi-Rez Presents! Thank you so much for being a passionate, amazing toxic community. See you on the Battleground of the russophobes and russian biogarbage! Of course, only if you can run this.
After playing  1293 hours on this account alone, I can say I hate the state of the game now.  The merge between pc and consoles has killed any communication in casual play other than VGS spam from the kids who cant type on a keyboard.  Not to mention you'll be playing with 2/5 Spanish speaking players even though it's a NA server??? Games crash constantly.  Low Rez you suck.  I'm out!~
since yesterdays update thre login system in the EU is completely F....KD somehow. many EU players cant login bcs the game either gives error messages or it just freezes during loading publisher logos and especially the infamous " waiting on game data " screen. until HiReZ fixes this crap... F...K SMITE
Was a good game
was... 
now it's full of bugs, freezes  and glitches. Matchmaking is a mess 
developers care only about injecting more cash-grabs like recolored skins instead of fixing balance and software problems 
for the last month can't log into game, like the rest of eastern and northern Europe 
game is dead, look out for paragon successor, it seems more promising 

im joining the strike against hi-rez as for now i am unable to play the game entirely. there has been a bunch of "fixes" for these on the forums that the fans made up cuz hi-rez didnt give a shit that works for a small number of ppl (maybe like 2-3) while everyone else is just hoping they can start the game at all. this is getting way out of hand with the recent update that came last day as its even worse now than it was before. I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THEY COULD MAKE IT WORSE BUT HERE WE ARE. if you are thinking of playing the game then wait a while and see if this problem goes away otherwise you are better of looking for another moba like dota league of legends or hots. they might not be as good as smite but at least they fucking work

EDIT: there is now a fix making you able to log in but the problems arent gone yet as the option to cross platform play is on by defeult making pc only que times abysmally large. ive heard ppl waiting 40 mins to get into a game. so you can now get into the menu but you cant acually play the game, you solve one problem and another one comes right after-.-
After I bought my new PC my account got banned
Installed to play Smite in steam
Got account banned after 3 games with BOTS.
Hi-Rez support responded that its Easyanticheat who got my account banned
Spoke with Easyanticheat support, and they said Its Hi-Rez manual ban. No response from Hi-Rez for 2 weeks.
i cant play this game anymore. For a few months now i have queue multiple times but every single time the game crashes. i have tried different queues but all of them crash the game. there have been multiple updates since this started and none of them have helped. they might fix this in the future but i still wont play this game anymore after this. This to me shows that hi-rez is ether completly incompetent or does not care at all about there games.
So, I've played SMITE for 77 hours and then suddenly it refused to launch. It freezes on a starting logo and it is a deadlock, even though it worked perfectly before. I've tried literally everything including techsupport, however they adviced to restart my router as a solution, that certainly doesn't fucking help. Moreover I want to stress that matchmaking of the game sucks like experienced whore. I wouldn't recommend to you, unless you have time to waste.
Broke steam integration at some point in late 2018. Cannot change the account you log-in to any longer either, so pretty much lost all progress, and all gods. Hirez support tickets are never answered, or when they are they say "sorry but we're working on new features, we'll fix your issue in two to three months." lmao fuck off
Be prepared for any PvP game to be RIDDLED with leavers. There are exactly 0 penalties for your teammate leaving at lv1, so why bother ever starting a game?
Been playing this game since closed Beta, and I'm still probably going to, but god damn it's difficult justifying in hindsight of their stance towards EU in general. Im talking both about the esports controversey, but also the fact that Smite has been unplayable for many europeans for the past 3 weeks as of this reviews date, with no word or acknowledgement from Hirez. This has become quite ridiculous tbh.
played this alot on ps4, recently got a pc so thought id give it a shot here, cant even get the game to load through steam always freezes, and by looks of the reviews im not alone, such a shame, cant recomend it as is
Have played this game much more then the steam hours show, 1460H 42M according to smite.guru, however I recently was forced to install it on steam in order to even get the game to launch. Along with this the patches keep getting buggier, loading frames you paid money for are sometimes displaying and other times not showing (you can contact support however they do not get back to you), freezing when alt tabbed. randomly closing. 

Balancing has really seen better days (mostly issues with gods rather then items). 
The crossplay introduced in S6 must be turned on for pc players to find a que which leads to some really poor player skilled xbox teamates or opponents (sluggish turning just play medusa you win every match vs xbox). 
Ultra wide no longer works for menus or commendation screens. it just crops it and cuts off the 4th player so you cannot even give them a commendation if they earned it. 

Could write more but I think this gets the basic issues across. 
Would love to see some of the bugs and balancing get addressed as I enjoy this game. hopefully hirez reads their reviews.
In it's current state(patch 6.1) it's not worth the price for EU players. What i mean by that is that it isn't worth your hard drive space or the time required to download it. the game just doesn't work, it crashes as soon as you launch it and if you do get it to work by some miracle then it's bound to crash or freeze either at the start of a game or during it. So don't download this piece of crap.
Fix your god damn steam log in. If i have 2 people in my house and 1 computer. I can't use the shitty steam version cause there isnt an easy way to log in and out like before. Hi-Rez going in reverse
I've played Smite since 2014, and I've loved the game for a long time. I've developed a love-hate relationship with this game. But now, fuck this game. Matchmaking is horrible, everytime I play joust, the teammates I play with quit bc one takes blue or dies too many times and then the other one follows. If I play conquest, if one person decides to give up because they die and blame every one else on the team, they throw the game. If I play conquest, comps are unfair and my team are full of lvl 30 players while the entire other team is lvl 130 and up. I've tried so many times to give this game another chance but I just don't find any joy in losing if I'm the only person that knows how to play on my team. Horrible matchmaking and toxic community base ruined this game more than Hi-Rez could even with their unbalanced characters.
Season 6 completely ruined the game

From toxic XBox players disconnecting to removing the treasure chests to a shitty battle pass with 4 crap skins. The last update was just awful.
Ok, let me start by saying that this game can be fun. CAN be. You learn a new god, feel comfortable with them, get a few decent games, great time! And then you get matched against a team with a much higher ELO or skill level than you that spam-taunts you every time they kill you. Or, if you're playing alone, there's either one single elitist teammate that's spamming the VGS with "awesome!" every time you die or two teammates that are arguing with each other over some stupid in-game bullshit. Seriously, I want to make this a major point in this review, THE COMMUNITY FOR THIS GAME SUCKS. Are we getting the runoff of people that quit playing League of Legends? Imagine yourself being a 30 years old carpenter hired to build a shed with a bunch of high school kids. That's what playing this game feels like. If you have friends to play with, play with them because if you don't you're probably just gonna end up hating the game. I think the post-game report feature was added in good faith but doesn't work the way I think it's supposed to. Basically how this works is that if someone leaves or deserts the game on purpose, the other players can report that player and i'm assuming that player would get investigated and possibly banned. The only problem with this system is that THE COMMUNITY FUCKING SUCKS. Was there a player that was being toxic throughout the match? Just report them! Was there a player that died just a few too many times for your liking? Probably an intentional feeder, just report them! Are you just some asshole kid that gets salty every time you get a shitty team? Go ahead and waste Hi-Rez's time with fake reports and just report them! See the problem here? This system gives nobody any accountability for their actions, so basically anyone can report anybody for any reason and not have to give a shit whether it's a legit report or not. You could be a brand new player and still be in the process of genuinely learning the game and then get reported "because you suck". 
Besides the toxic community, this game runs like shit 90% of the time. The first issue shows up before I can even start up the game; I start the game and get greeted with a 3-5 minute long loading screen, which honestly I don't even keep track of how long it takes because I usually just scroll through Instagram or something for a few minutes while I wait for the game to start up. Then I finally get in the game and I start a match only to find out that I'm lagging all over the map. My internet is at an okay speed, but somehow I have 80-120 ping at all times? Then I turn on literally any other online game on my computer and I have no ping issues. K. So the game barely loads up and the ping makes it borderline unplayable, but there's some cool new skins coming out! Yay! That makes up for all of it! Right? You feel content with the game again and head to bed. But then the next day you find out that you've been logged out of your account and don't remember your password so you need to get a new one. You request a verification email, and then another one, and then another one, and then another one, but none of them actually get to you. After a few days you keep trying. Nothing. Then you reach out to Hi-Rez with your issue. No response. So how am I supposed to actually play the game? Second account. This literally happened to my friend about a week ago. I still don't think he's gotten a response about his account. 
At this point I don't know if this is a real review or just a rant at this point, but whatever. I HATE this whole console integration thing. They changed the layout of main menu so that it is the same between PC and console. The only problem is that it FUCKING SUCKS. Was anyone really asking for this? I stopped playing some time in the middle of season 3 and came back near the end of season 5, so I came back and had no fucking clue what I was looking at. It's now a few months later and I still have trouble making my way through the main menu. It's just so damn weird and a lot of things are very hard to find. But everything is okay though, because there's a cool new skin package on sale for 600 gems, that makes it all better, right? NO. I wish Hi-Rez would focus more on getting the game to run THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO rather than throwing out skins. 
To finish this all off, this game has it's plus sides. Underneath a shit ton of negatives, this game has a few positives. I recommend only playing this game if you have friends. There's really no reason for me to play this game alone ever again, I know it's just gonna be a horrible time. Unless you can handle playing with/against a group of middle schoolers with nothing else to care about, don't bother playing this.
Early beta player. Game used to be fun, intuitive, balanced, and the matchmaking balanced and fast. Not so much anymore. This MOBA's expiration date has long since passed.
I dont reccomend the game!

After 2404 hours spending in this game,the developers ruinned it!! 
Bad interface,bad development,bad ideas resulting in this crap!
THe idea of bringing console players playing with pc gamers is so bad!
It was fun,it had potentionals and now this game will fall hard!

WHy HIREZ? DO you need more  money?
MAybe your finicial managers are bad and the ideas about a game are not for a game ,are for their pockets!

People that care only for money and destorying a gamer community are stupids!

Thats why retro gaming will rise!
this game is complete garbage, matchmaking sistem is broken i am lvl 100 and highest rank i got was gold 1 in joust, the sistem thinks its okay to match me against diamonds or masters that are level 160 and give me some first time playing ranked level 30 kids who dont even understand how to use that vgs sistem (its hard to memorise and super importaint if you want to play ranked, but i know all of it). the game takes about 6 minutes to launch off my hdd or ssd, witch is insane for a game (no other game in my library takes that long). each game update adds skins and breaks the servers. sometimes the server decides to put me on NA servers while im from EU, witch isint a big problem because the ping difrence is about 20 (EU avarage 100, NA:120 ping). just now i went ranked and the game force tabed out for me and didnt let me back in, got a 30min deserter cooldown for it. also skills often dont cast because why should they in a MOBA, its not like they are important. the game has a lot of skill casting bugs and server issues, even if you like the 3rd person aiming thing, i would recommend playing something else so maybe hirez would start caring about the game a bit more and do something about the 100 ping i get on EU servers, like wtf, no other game is as broken as this one. Maybe hirez just hates me i tried reinstalling the game like 5 times to fix some issues as it was recommended for me by some people, but nothing changes the game still tabs out, still get random lag spikes and still takes about 6 minutes to launch of my hhd or 3 minutes of my ssd.
Okay, don't even bother playing this piece of crap unless you typically enjoy poking yourself in the eye with a rusty nail.  It is horrible.  Game play is repetitive and totally without rhyme or reason.  Warriors cannot warrior.  Well they can if you consider how easily they die a glorious and futile death.  That's 1 v 1.  If you have the misfortune of being 1 v 2 or worse then you might as well start planning the funeral ceremony.

Tanks?  ROFL!!!!  The "tank" gods in this game are made of glass.  They can't take a hit.  They can't do damage and they certainly cannot hold aggro, which considering the fact that they can't take a hit is probably a positive rather than a negative.

This game is totally about ganking some poor slob who makes the mistake of believing what he reads in the item description and thinks that his pathetic melee class character can actually make a difference in the battle.  The only difference you make with melee is how many kills the enemy side gets.
Can no longer buy gems with your steam wallet, wasted a ton of money on this game. They keep running it into the ground, it was a good run but i am officially done with smite.
Unbalanced meta's. Too many gods now when only about 30% of them are even useful. Stopped playing the main 5v5 a while ago and started playing 3v3 instead. 

Community is toxic as all hell and you will probably get reported by that one guy who's playing he bo for the first time and went 0/8

Also no major changes have even happened to the 3v3 game mode since they replaced the map with a worse one a couple seasons ago.

There's not many items per class actually worth buying, mostly just sticking to almost a preset of meta items.

The whole lootbox economy is fucked now and the constant stream of "BUY THESE SKINS TO UNLOCK THE RARE NEVER AVAILABLE ONE AGAIN" only costs about £200 every 2 months or so. There's the odyssey, hera's odyessey, the vaults, the adventures, halloween events, summer events, random events. On top of lootbox exclusive and limited skins
I played a whole lot when Smite had it's own client. Haven't really bothered to play it again because I found a much better MOBA, League of Legends, to play. Once you've played another MOBA other than this, you will realize just how awful this game feels to play. Nothing feels right in this game, your auto attacks feel slow and unimpactful. Getting objectives feels pointless. Just everything falls in comparison to any other MOBA. Please, just either download League, or get Dota 2 right here on Steam for FREE! Do not even fucking bother.
been playing for a long time now, with the new update the game wont let me login to my account and wants me to make a new one. ive spent alot of money on this game and i will be pissed off beyond reason if i loose it all.
Gameplay is crap, sfx are crap, heroes are boring and mind numbing, graphics are crap, crossplay is crap, hit registration is crap, lag switchers everywhere, balance is crap, community is crap (toxic), micro-transactions are crap, gamemodes are crap, and devs are crap. 

Pros: tiddy physics.

Crap/10
Really Liked smite on XBox. Now On PC I refuse to pay for all of the same shit over again. These devs truly are outrageously greedy when it comes to giving people what they payed for. I supported your game in early access and once again it screws you in the end. So many better games to play at the moment, avoid this waste of time.
This game has gone from fun and cool with a little bullshit sprinkles to a pile of shit with tumors and cancer growing inside, making the pile of shit lumpy and twisted and pulsing, and HiRez tries to keep it alive by feeding it every day, but the tumors and cancer grow faster then ever due to this and the pile of shit is just laying there wishing for death while HiRez transforms it into a literal ball of cancer and growths that can't kill itself fast enough to finally die as advertisers and other companies try to hype it up and change it to what the current fad is. Nice Tomerelli's Fucknite battle pass you morons implemented. The only thing I look forward to in relation to this game is that one day it will die and then, once the shares have dropped in price significantly, someone will pick up this disgusting crystal ball of shit that shows old memories of this game you enjoyed covered in tumors that fades away into a winter storm of salt and tears, and they'll actually NERF GODS CORRECTLY and make the game good once again. HiRez, please sell your "game". You suck at making it fun nowadays. 

P.S. I played using the HiRez launcher, but I downloaded it on Steam just so I could leave a review. Account Dersingoki Go to SmiteGuru dot com and you'll see I have 530 hours in this game. I know EXACTLY how much this game sucks now compared to how it used to be. By the way, the Active System was far better than the Relic System in my opinion.
I used to play this game a whole lot. But now recently it's so buggy I can't even play. It was so buggy that I couldn't choose a character and deemed me as a deserter for 26 minutes. When it wasn't even my fault. fuck this game. I hope it dies and burns in hell for eternity.
Game is dead, the forced cross-play is a last grab from the developers to hopefully spark up some new players as a Moba it is failing. Their riding heavily on consoles as it's basically a monopoly as there is no current Moba for consoles and no competition. As the game is hindering it self due to the horrible matchmaking and indisputable negligence from the developers.

Matchmaking is the worst in this game. Anyone of you can even do this for the same experience. Simple test, enter a casual game of any kind, make sure your profile is not hidden. Almost every game if not on your team or against your team there will be a player which will not even match the criteria to play ranked yet alone be matched up with a player beyond its level. How the developers thought this was a good idea, blows my mind. The newer player obviously gets destroyed and gets bombarded with toxicity from his team and gets put off from playing the game further. The enemy team also gets mad as this isn't even a game and unfair.

Ranked matchmaking does this quite a bit better, as soon as you get out of the low tier's you start getting matched with players in your level and rank.

The UI is disgusting, and how it didn't get updated still blows my mind, and in-fact how it was added and forced upon the PC players at all from the previous more detailed UI is beyond belief. The people that make these decisions at Titan/HiRez need to get fired, as they are obviously pulling the game down and making horrible decisions for the game and company.

Constant bugs, that can last for months before being replaced or fixed.

Customer Service from my experience has been great, and I generally get a reply from 3-7 days. But rarely do I get anything longer, but I also only go to the customer support when its necessary and not for trivial matters. 

I guess I won't play SMITE anymore, I liked the Season Ticket, lots of prizes for playing and suporting the game, but now they changed into a Battle Pass, and if you have the Free Battle Pass you will get nothing, everything good (good = skins and things like card frame ...) is on the paid one. Bye SMITE. And yes, I like cosmetics XD.
I can play some of the most demanding games on a 4k with my 1080ti, and Smite is the only game that freezes or causes restarts. Plus i can't even get into the game unless I force close aura sync.
Tripped MalwareBytes on my PC when I launched the game recently. Said it detected ransomware. I've played a lot of games and none of them have tripped my antivirus, so I am confused as to why this one would. My only conclusion is that it may have been some sort of false positive for ransomware (I doubt the devs ship their game with ransomware). However, I wouldn't be surprised if it was some kind of adware. I would love to hear an explanation. For now, I'm not putting my PC at risk no matter how fun the game may be.
New cross-platform update brings retarded console players in matches who doesn't communicate at all and picks different gods at different lanes and/or they just laneswap between duo, mid and solo lanes all the time =DDDDD And FYI keyboard and mouse outskill players with controller =D
Clunky animations, bad graphics, worst skins, damn the completely flat floor, almost no activable items, bad and ugly interface, published by the worst games company.
Smite could have been a great game, sadly Hi-Rez decided to pick the idea and didn't leave it to some competent studio.
A difficult game to master, with a ridiculous learning curve and no help outside of basic M.O.B.A roles. With a host of U.I and connection issues , especially for E.U, you'd be lucky to get anywhere. In summary waste of time.
Hi-rez is your ideal money hungry company making rip off games. These people put more work into there sexist skins and other wack cosmetics to get your money than actually making the game work right and be fun to play. Its sad cause Smite has a unique and fun approach to a MOBA due to the position you see your god, but sadly the pedos and sexist people running Hi-rez have nothing but money on their mind.
TLDR game dont even want to run or let me log in.
What a joke. Reinstalled after a few years to try again and this shit dont even want to launch. Try to login to my old account and that shit is buggy as all hell. Takes just as long to close the game as it does to open it. Now i have to unistall all this bullshit that in installed from 2012 c++  Have to restart my computer cause a the game window is glitched in the background forever. Wouldnt be surprised if they removed my account even though i gave them $$$$$. PRolly good i dont get to play cause every time they release a new god for $$$$ he is Overpowered as all hell because they want $$$$$$$ then after they get money they nerf the fuck out of said god and no one plays it anymore. Stupid ass balance game of shit gods and op ones.
I tried to enjoy this game, but I couldn't. There's a pay wall with locked heroes and the free ones are mediocre. It would be nice if new accounts could have access to all the heroes for a week or two, or at least let new players choose 1-2 classes (mage or hunter for example - I enjoy ranged heroes) and open up the hero pool for that respective class. I saw a few twitch streams and it looked fun - but again, the gods/heroes I saw were stuck behind a pay wall.
I'm not unfamiliar with MOBAs in any way, and I can say that SMITE does a horrible job of making a new player comprehend what a MOBA is. The gimmick of it being in 3rd person adds almost nothing, and just makes everything more counter-intuitive than MOBAs should be. The main problem I have with it is that it gives a horrible picture of what a MOBA is. The 5v5 gamemode is not unlocked until level 5. That's a problem as IT'S THE MODE THAT MOBAS MADE THEIR NAME OFF OF. It's not ok to not let you play the mode the game is based on until a certain level. Hi-Rez is a pretty horrible company, and this just makes my impression of them worse. If you want to play a MOBA, try Vainglory, League of Legends, DOTA 2, or Arena of Valor. I would not recommend this game to anyone who wants to play a traditional MOBA.
Still does not have Set, Sekhmet, Horus. Ptah,  Cronus, Gaia, Uranus, Atlas, or any of the other Gods that are more interesting. Instead of adding in Jesus Christ, they add in fucking Merlin..

Expect these brainlets to insert shit weeb Gods and pantheons that don't make sense.
If you play Thanatos, you're a cunt
If you play Merlin, you're a cunt
If you play Scylla, you're a cunt
If you play Anubis, you're a cunt
If you play Bastet, you're a cunt
If you play Baron Samedi, you're a cunt

Games garbage
Ok so i have played this game quite a bit and i think i have a right to rewiew it now. 

SHORT VERSION: This game sucks. First i thouthg it was good, but after the time I invested in it i realised otherwise. Its a Hi Rez game after all.

LONG VERSION: This game once had its charms, but now......NOT ANYMORE. Its full of little crybabies and people that seem MENTALY RETARTED. I cant sit down and play this game without once having someone insta lock a character, or an idiot feed so fucking much. AND THE WORST THING IS THAT THE REPORT SYSTEM DOESNT WORK. Like whats the point if he gets nothing if he intentionaly feeds the enemy team, or goes AFK. And by AFK id ont mean: "Oh sorry guys GTG" kinda guy but actualy: "Im a salty little bich and im gonna stand in base and do nothing cus you stole my kills" kinda guy.

All in all. If you want to give it a try do it, but i wouldnt reccomend it.
This game is fck like a hell 
1) I need to wait game with pc only 1 fck hour!! If i chose both contollers ofc i found it faster but ppl will be stay afk or pick the same role like u or ur teammate.  lot of trash is here this game became a picie of sht i cant win every game and im mot the proff or such a good player but its so hard when u have afk leaver 3 assasins and uslees ppl
