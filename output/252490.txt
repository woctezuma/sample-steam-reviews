So I started playing 'Rust' at 4pm yesterday.

Within 3 minutes of my first time playing, a bear ate me. Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.

Ate some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.

I slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.

Then I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.

Its now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains. Don't dare risk making a fire, someone might see it at night and kill me for the tin of baked beans I got off a zombie I found wandering around a town that gave me radiation poisoning. Oh yeah, I'll probably die slowly because of the radiation, but thats a problem for later-me.

In a tiny hut on a mountain with my sleeping bag and meager belongings after 12 hours of playing straight, I can probably safely say I'm enjoying this game.
After around an hour and a half of bad spawns, scarce resources, and short-lived ventures into the more inhabited areas of the map, I ran into the first friendly player I had met in Rust. I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote "Sorry guys :D" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be "shoot-on-sight?" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. 

All in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game. People like that are the single reason why so many players on steam feel that they wasted money on what would otherwise be a great experience.
I love this game, I built a house around a guys house and made him my prisoner, I fed him cans of tuna and cooked chicken when it was available, and some times I would drop in spare logs of wood(when they were available). The best part. he talks to me, keeps telling me his clans going to raid my structure and save him.. I simply respond with .” It puts the lotion on its skin, or it gets the hose again” and by hose I mean I dump charcoal on him.
-Great game hope the servers come up soon, I think my pet may need to eat.

-Maniken
So before i begin with this review : Yeah we all know Rust is a laggy piece of sh*t sometimes, so i won`t discuss this here.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
- Great concept
- Stunning graphics
- Game mechanics are great
- The combat system is good
- The crafting system is very good
- Weekly updates! Which is one of the most important things for an Early Access game!
- Good and serious developers, who listen to the community
- Modding is easy, and the community has almost full access to modding
- Skins

[h1]Cons[/h1]
- Not optimised for extreme potato users, but that is not a main problem i.m.o
- The community can be cancerous at times, but that is life! Not everyone you meet will be nice or help you!
- Server creation is a little complicated, but if you are stubborn enough you will learn how to do it / manage it

[b][u]Day 1[/u][/b]

I seem to have woken up on a mysterious island, I don't remember much. All I have is a rock.. I'm scared.
There seems to be no sign of other humans. I do not have any food or shelter yet, however, I was able to obtain a few logs by hitting a tree with this rock multiple times.. What a mysterious island.

[b][u]Day 2[/u][/b]

I have found a chicken, some more wood, and a few stones, I was able to conceive an amateur, handmade axe, it only took a few seconds to make, so I was able to kill the chicken too. I have also gathered a fairly large pile of wood, I might be able to build a makeshift shelter, but for now...
Tonight I feast.

[b][u]Day 3[/u][/b]

Today is the day, I will finally build a shelter, I can feel the warmth of a warm bed and fire already. I haven't felt this good since I was a child, playing with my toys, I remember one toy more than most, it was called a "Steam", ahh, the good ol' days.
I will be home soon. 
I promise.

[b][u]Day 4[/u][/b]

I'm sorry.
I have killed a man.
It all happened so fast, he was holding a gun, I was debating on making peace with him, but he seemed the brutal sort.
And all of his gear, it was... Enticing.
He must have had a family, but I am becoming selfish it seems, I don't care about the man that I have killed.
All that I can think of is one thing, not my family, not his family...
But tonight I feast.

[b][u]Day 5[/u][/b]

I've come across a small, abandoned town, there seems to be a lot of loot within the area.
The only problem is that I obtain a heavy dose of radiation if I go into the barriers.
I have a choice: Obtain what's necessary to survive and die from radiation, or live on how I am now.. In poverty.
I think I'll live.
Just for a while longer.

[b][u]Day 6[/u][/b]

I saw a man today, outside of my cabin, he was naked and he had a rock.. He seemed to have been yelling incomprehensible jibberish, he must be insane.. I remember when I was like that.
I still am in a way.

[b][u]Day 7[/u][/b]

I don't know what to do.
The man that I saw yesterday came into my cabin while I was asleep, he held a rock to my head and struck..
My life flashed before my eyes, stupid reflex, I grabbed my journal.
Remember when I said that I was coming home? Sadly my dear, you'll have to meet me in heaven.
I am bleeding out. I am in god's hands now.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[b]"HEY ROBERT, I FOUND SOME D0UCHE'S DIARY!"

"HAHA, WHAT AN IDIOT! I BET HE TASTES GOOD THOUGH, TONIGHT WE FEAST!"[/b]
[h1] Before you scroll down and read the rest.. let me say one thing: "Rust is a high risk, high reward -type of game, if you get salty every time you die.. then move along.. this game isn't for you". [/h1]
_______________________________

[h1][b]General game information [/b][/h1]

This game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it.

Obviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place.

[h1][b]My experience [/b][/h1]

At the time of writing this review i've been playing this game for years. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it.
After figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering the two of us started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game, I didn't.
For some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them.
This resulted in over 1800 hours of gameplay. 1800 of GLORIOUS hours. But like I said earlier, this game isn't for the feint of heart.
_______________________________

[h1][b]State of the Game [/b][/h1]

When you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to "Legacy" being the best state of the game, I disagree.
The current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game.
These are named: [b]The Blueprint system + The component system[/b].
Most Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn't get any love.
A week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier.
[b]The Blueprint system + The component system[/b] - Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped.
_______________________________

[h1][b]The pros [/b][/h1]
[list]
[*]If you use a microphone, you will have the most fun and random interactions you have ever experienced.
[*]There's a lot of ways to express your creativity. Basebuilding, gearsets, drawing penisses on other peoples bases.
[*]There is no real endgame, so you can set your own goals. Trust me when I say that those can be very rewarding.
[*]Its a great game for Youtube content (has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.)
[*]Its a great game for Twitch content (has a streamer mode to hide from streamsnipers, has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.)
[*]As a big community that really loves the game, but for the most part is filled with toxic players. (Like any other game these days)
[*]The game is constantly being developed. Weekly changes+additions with every patch.
[*]The game also has a great Dev team, they are hardworking and very dedicated
[/list]

[h1][b]The cons [/b][/h1]
[list]
[*]It has a big learning curve. The first thing you need to do is join a empty server and start figuring stuff out cause on a populated server you will get punished for it.
[*]A lot of people KoS in the current state of the game, which is fine for me cause im used to it. But if you are new it can be very offputting.
[*]The game has a very annoying memoryleak that will cause problems no matter how much GB you got in that godlike computer of yours. (they are working on it)
[*]Deciding on the correct server for you to join will directly affect how much fun the game is for you as a soloplayer.
[*]The official servers are terrible. There is hardly ever a admin in there to counteract a possible cheater. My advice: Stick to the community servers.
[*]The game uses a day/night cycle. During the night it truly is pitchblack and you wont be able to see a thing. Unless you have Nvidia, then you can just fire up the gamma and you'll be fine. Especially vs people that have a AMD graphics card. Its a annoying problem in the game thats currently being looked into.
[/list]

[h1][b]The future isn't set in stone. [/b][/h1]

Well, sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I've seen the game go through 3-4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones.
_______________________________

[h1][b]Conclusion [/b][/h1]

If you are still interested after reading all this, definately buy the game. Over the years of me playing Rust, I've had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game.
_______________________________

[h1][b]Side note [/b][/h1]

I'm working on a really big tutorial for this game. So if you are interested in that.. please check out my profile and subscribe to my youtube page. If not, I hope this review helped you a bit. Im not a professional reviewer or anything of the sorts. I'm just giving you my two cents about the game.
Do you think this game is fun? - Yes
Is the game well made? - Yee
Is the game worth its price? - Definitely
Will I have fun playing solo? - Maybe
Is it worth playing solo? - Hell no
Will everyone try to kill me? - Aye
Will I get raided? - More than you think
Does it hurt to get raided? - Yes
Will I loose part of my soul every time being raided? : Most likely
Is it fun to raid someone: Absolutely
Does feeling good after raiding someone make me a bad person: Probably
Is the community toxic - Mostly

My verdict: 8/10




You'll get your best experience during your first days of playing - a romantic novice with a naive belief that you can do whatever you want on that wonderful dangerous island spending hours for mining, planning & constructing buildings of your dreams... And then it starts...
With every new death and robbed shelter your mind accumulates anger at all that.
You study yourself, read guides, watch videos, become aggressive and evil.
After weeks of successful and unsuccessful acts of vengeance you'll understand that this game forced to be played one way: creating top equipment, maximum protection of your shelter, raiding everything that stands and destroying everything that moves.
Congratulations! You've started living a revenge in an environment where ceasing to create violence means to perish by yourself. 
Worth trying but promise yourself to stop one day.
Rust isn't about building a pretty fort with your friends, logging out and then coming back tomorrow to pick up where you left off. No, Rust is about psychology. I have watched a bunch of naked men with rocks rove the hillside in search of the "clothed" and kill mercilessly. I have watched people come together over d*ck paintings they created together. Sometimes you will join a server and there is a small group that take everything and leave nothing. You might even be taken prisoner or trapped and then taunted until eventually it is too much and you give up on life. Much like real life there are good people and bad people. If you take games too seriously, you won't enjoy this. This is survival of the numbers and occasionally survival of the most clever. Never give up, never give in, it all starts with a rock.
I woke up in the grass, my head hurting and my body cold. I was naked.

I ran around, looking for a fellow survivor. After an hour, I saw him. I yelled at him as loud as I could, and he turned around. 

We greeted each other, and agreed to work together.

After a few days, we'd built a house, and had enough supplies to last a week. We had weapons, food and water. Life was good.

One day, on our daily raid, we spotted someone. He was naked, and ran towards us. He greeted us, we greeted him back, and he and I started a conversation. Suddenly, my friend pulls me back and whispers to me. He said we should kill him. Survival of the fittest.

I looked back at the innocent man and gave him my pickaxe and told him to leave. My friend sighed, and gave him some clothes. He thanked us, and left. 

The next day, he appears again, to say thanks, and that he has a gang as well, so that we could join him. We kindly refused. He sounded a bit agitated, but he said no problem, and left.

Later that night, I hear footsteps outside our house. My friend was fast asleep, so I grabbed my homemade shotgun and looked outside.

It was the man. The man who we gave a pickaxe to. He was inspecting our house with someone else, but quickly left after he saw a bear running towards him.

The next morning, I woke up my friend and told him what happened. He told me I shouldn't have trusted him, and that war is coming.

I was raiding an old town, when suddenly on top of a hill in the distance, I saw him. Although this time, he had his gang. There were a lot of them. About 10-20. My friend noticed this as well, and told me to get inside. We got inside, and it was quiet for about an hour. My friend and I go outside, and see them waiting.

They said that they were friendly, but we didn't trust them. My friend and I got out our shotguns and told them to leave. They didn't listen. 

Then the war began.

They got out guns and shot at us, firing at all directions. My friend got hit, and yelled at me to get inside and lock the door. My friend barely got inside, but when he did, it was already to late- they were inside.

Luckily, we had a panic room for this kind of situation. It had an iron door, which could only be broken down by C4. We rushed down there as the scavengers began to search our house.

After a few minutes, they'd discovered we were in the panic room, so they began swinging at it with the pickaxe I gave them. It didn't work. When suddenly, I heard a boom. They had C4.

My friend and I discussed what we should do. We agreed that when we get taken hostage, we run like hell.

They eventually got in, took all of our gear, and we were naked again. They were about to execute us when suddenly, my friend got up and began to run. He ran as fast as the wind would take him. They missed every shot they took at him, so I decided I had nothing to lose, so I ran as well. 

It was pitch black outside. I felt around and felt a bush, so I hid in there. In the distance, I could see torches everywhere. My friend saved my life, but the enemy was searching for him. There was nothing I could do, so I ran off, and began my new life.

To this day, I don't know what my friend is doing. Dead or alive, he's a hero. The enemy army got raided by an even stronger group, and me?

I'm surviving.

Stories like this make Rust such a good game. It truly is an experience. I highly recommend this game. Although the glitches are a bit annoying, you get used to it.

then I left Egypt, bought Rust and the same thing happened in Rust
I met a man who helped me with my adventures. Here is my story.

- I met a man who helped me when I started my adventures in this beautiful island. He helped me out since I was a newbie, he fed me chicken that came from a cow, sheltered me in a wooden house that I couldn't escape from and he protected me from the wolves I tried to pet. Once I finally understood the game, he released me into the wild, I took a few steps into the open and BOOM I got shot in the back by him. I respawned at camp and beat him up with a rock, took his stuff and ran off happily ever after.

10/10 MUST BUY

EDIT: The man has captured me once again, but this time, my knowledge has advanced. I entered his fortress willingly, but little did he know, I was an evil mastermind. He took me as one of his "crew members". Along with 2 other people, we journeyed and raided other buildings. But slowly I stole gear from their base and soon, equipped with full kevlar and a bolt action rifle, destroyed their sleeping bags and once again killed them all. I ran away while holding the V key (in game chat) and played the TROLOLOLOL song. I ran off into the sun set and went offline to write this update.
[h1]├Professors Review┤[/h1]

[b]Game Pros[/b]
• Clean menu
• Players can host their own servers off their computers for free, or pay to have it hosted on a local server
• Intricate base building system
• Hunting/Gathering 
• Day/Night Cycle
• Weather System
• Moddable
• Frequent updates and Dev blogs
• Procedural generated world
• Gives you a sense of paranoia
• Generated Biomes (Desert, Snow, Grass)

[b]Game Cons[/b]
• Game tends to lag/rubber-band if too many people are connected to the server
• Uses a lot of RAM
• KoS (Really depends on the person, but what do you expect?)
• VoIP needs work (Causes a second or two of lag after letting go of the VoIP key)
• Framerate/Crashing issues on AMD cards (Mainly on the R9 290)
• Runs on the Unity engine (Making it not the best for optomization, but the dev team is managing)
• Animals don't follow rules of physics. (They will run up walls if they feel like it)

[b]Controversial Features[/b]
• Sleeper servers (Even when you log off you are still in-game, and able to be killed. Pretty much forces you put in time to build a stable base before leaving the server. Or risk being killed.

[b]Relateable Games[/b]
• H1Z1
• The Forest 
• DayZ

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Rust can be a very fun survivial game, especially with friends. I put "DayZ" as a relateable game, but let me assure you they are two different games and should never be compared, other than them having a survival aspect. Rust can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers, so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action, id suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gathering. Overall, if you have the money, i'd suggest looking into buying this game. It is currently in Alpha, so really look into it before purchasing. 

[h1]Score[/h1]
60/100

[i](If you found this review helpful, consider giving it a thumbs up!)[/i]
Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer, so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet, as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax; enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious, you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources—the entry-level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.

But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust. 

I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design, or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings, but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, so when you're spotted by an idiot, you'll start hearing the shit-talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.

It's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it. I wish I could say that it didn't feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn't know I was carrying), and put him down with a single well-placed strike. I wish I could tell you that, as I was standing over his fatally wounded body, that I didn't laugh my ass off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting, "Hey man, wait a second!" I wish I could say I didn't kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust, and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.
After nearly 3,500 hours I finally decided to review one of my favorite games on PC. In fact, it was the reason why I bought a gaming PC in the first place.

Pros:
- RAIDING - Raiding other groups, clans, or enemies provided me with many hours of tactical, engaging, and intense fights. It is one of the core aspects of the game, and is what kept me hooked for so long.

- PVP -Rust is one of those rare games that gets your heart rate pumping after killing a couple of enemies, and trying to loot all of their bodies while zig zagging your way to safely deposit your loot back home. All while your hands are shaking.

- BUILDING - The way that people build bases is constantly being changed through certain forced updates. You used to be able to build huge castles and compounds, but now the game has switched to a more bunker base style build. This change in style every once in a while is refreshing in the form of you aren't seeing the same base build over and over again from YouTube tutorials.

- ROLEPLAY - Facepunch has implemented many items that encourage friendly player to player interaction. From shop fronts and vending machines, to mailboxes and notes, and to the new furniture being added to the game, there is certainly a place for your casual gamer. 

Cons:
Don't get this game if you won't treat it like a full time job. You will be disappointed every time you login to find that your base has been raided by a bunch of high schoolers who can spend almost 12 hours a day on the game.

Unfortunately, many Rust players are way too serious about their loot. Meaning, they would rather offline raid a base in 30 minutes, than be challenged in an online raid that provides multiple hours of fun for both sides. Also, a lot of shit talking and bragging about loot in the public chat.

Hackers, scripters, and ban evaders are everywhere.

FPS Stutters. The game on the highest setting looks beautiful, but expect to take a huge performance hit once you are in a gunfight. I run on potato settings with a high end PC to make sure I don't dip to 10 fps if I get in a big gunfight.

Overall, the gameplay in Rust is extremely addicting and you forget what time it is in real life while playing. However, the fact that you have to treat this game like a full-time job and the terrible performance hits is what will kill the game. Still, it remains my favorite.

[h1]Things to know about Rust:[/h1]

[b]ZERGS[/b]: (aka big groups) can stomp all over you because of sheer number advantage and the rate they can progress through the wipe. Zergs are especially powerful after they implemented the group update where you can see your teammates blips which means you dont have to call for a jump check anymore.

[b]NOT NOOB FRIENDLY[/b]: Very, very, very, few people you meet will be friendly. Normally, anyone you meet with any type of weapon will be hostile. You'll even see nakeds fight you with their rock when you spawn.

[b]PLAY WITH FRIENDS[/b]: Can't emphasise this enough. Having atleast one other person to play with is all you need. There are a lot of responsibilities you have as a rust player and it will be twice as easy and twice as fast to do it with a duo partner.

[b]YOU WILL DIE[/b]: You will die with all the loot in the world, many, many, times. Even more so if you try to play solo. I don't want to say solo is impossible, hJune shows us that, (and lots of other rust youtubers) but for new players its a no go.

[b]TIME INVESTING[/b]: The people who play the most have the best results. As in a person who plays 10 hours a day, everyday, for the entire wipe, will get much further than someone who plays a couple hours a day. If you don't have lots of time on your hand to play, I wouldn't play at all.

[b]TOXIC COMMUNITY[/b]: With any game, there is a fairly toxic community. Half the fights you win with a gun, your opponent usually makes fun of you for how many shots you missed and how much gunpowder you wasted, but I find this funny.

[b]HACKERS[/b]: Mostly on offical servers, so i suggest for you to play on community servers such as solo/duo/trio. Only problem is community servers die quicker than official servers.

[b]EXPERIENCE[/b]: Once you learn the ropes, it becomes a really fun game with intense moments and great fights.
Rust, Rust, Rust, where do I begin. Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into.

Well, first off, Rust is a game of "Survival". But their definition of survival is... well... different. To be bluntly honest, the nature of the game encourages and rewards you for being an absolute dickhead. For a game that plops you naked on a beach with nothing but a rock, there are alot of guns and powerful weapons players can get easily and very early on. The game appears to cater to clan and group wars, which I'll admit, makes for some excellent videos. But the fact of the matter is most people (myself included) don't want to play that way. This game becomes a HUGE investment of your time as typically, it will require hours to build a "raid-proof" home. And once your home is finished, you'll look out at the beautiful sunset and log off, confident your hard work has paid off, despite the fact that your home is only 30% actual home and the other 70% is pure armor. But when you log in less than 24 hours later, you find yourself waking up on noob beach. Because for every hour you spent building your home, some prick has spent double that left clicking the attack button with one hand while furiously fapping with the other to wreck your hard work. But if you can manage to build a good home on a good server, the game can be a very rewarding experience.

Rust for me had alot of disappointing, infuriating moments, which often keeps me from coming back to play. But it also had alot of great moments. The act of logging on alone was an anxiety, waiting at the loading screen wondering if I've been killed or if I was still safe. The intense feelings of paranoia from the presence of other players and of protecting my home. The adrenaline rushes of being shot at, and of going on intense raid missions. The excitement of assassinating a powerful kingpin (who deserved it) or gunning down a warring maruader. And finally, the feeling of looking out the window of my beautiful home at a beautiful view of the sunset or a full moon on the ocean. A game has never before invoked as much emotion out of me as Rust has.

I would reccomend these tactics for staying alive:
- Play "Native American" style. Plant your sleeping bag in a bush where no one will find it, and live a life of very little materialism. If you die or are robbed, you lost very little
- Hide. Build your home where no one will find it. Consider sacrificing a fort for a smaller home. It will be easier to raid, but harder to find. Raiders will assume there is a bigger bounty inside a bigger fort, but might decide not to waste their time on a smaller home because they'll think you're poor. Stay far away from the West and East coasts (where new players generally spawn), away from the middle of the map, and away from the road and rad towns. Build next to clusters of big rocks, or terrain that would be unappealing for travel (for example, tundra), and never in the open. You will likely be found eventually, but I have had games where I was either never found or if I was, players just left me alone. And it will give you lots of time to estabilsh your hold. 
- Play the game RIGHT after servers wipe so that you're the first person to start on a brand new island
- TRUST NO ONE. You may find players that will like to trade or who will actually help you. But always practice your politics very carefully. Most players will shoot you on sight
- Get a feel for the population of the server. I usually go to servers that appear abandoned and play alone for quite some time. Sometimes it works, sometimes the server suddenly becomes popular. You can refresh the server lists to constantly know how many people are on a server at all times. On rare occasions, you can find servers where the strongest players are friendly's who will actively hunt the kind of people who seek to ruin your day. You can collaborate with these people
- Understand raid tactics. You can lock your door, but can they blow a hole in your window? Come in from the roof or the foundation? Did you destroy the stairs so no one can get up to you? Did you build a third floor in case they blow up the first floor ceiling? Did you armor the hell out of your cupboard so they can't build their way around? There are lots of things to consider, and the game is constantly updating in ways that require new strategies.
- Raid a few homes yourself. I'm generally a peaceful player, but if I see someone setting up camp too close to my territory, I treat it like a threat. Because let's face it, it generally is. The players will eventually find your home if they haven't already, and you can't trust them not to come after you. Again, you can check the servers for population and you can scope out targets to determine if the player is currently online. Exploit weaknesses, get in, loot, and get out as fast as you can. Know how long the travel will take and take advantage of things such as the cover of night. Stay out of the road and weave through trees, bushes, and etc. Make sure no one sees you, catches your name, and make damn sure you aren't followed. 

Good luck and happy hunting
I was looking for the game of my life and I can easily say that I finally found it. I have been playing Video Games since PAC-MAN hit the game rooms, so when I say this game is unique and different from all the games that I have played before, please don't think that I exaggerate. I got frustrated or raged in games before but I have never had a big adrenalin rush before or had a cocktail of many different feelings in a game before. The first week of Rust burned into my memory, remembering running scared and losing myself in the game, it was too much. It was a Love & Hate, for which I kept coming back. You can become a hero or rich in a second and lose it all in another second and you can become the villain you despised so much. You will meet horrible people and great ones. With Rust, my game expectations changed so much that I can't play single-player games for very long now. I used to be lone gamer, but this game made me buy headphones with a microphone, my friend list went from 0 to 30. I started following YouTubers. I learned new words. I am not that salty anymore against toxic players, PvP became a norm, PvE became fun, going deep became a goal… It even had effect on my life that possession became more irrelevant - that this game showed me everything is fleeting over and over again. There is love, anger, betrayal, revenge, and all kind of roleplay… and I have grown in it.

⚠️ IN MY OPINION ⚠️
Great game but new players should play on modded servers with low population, community / vanilla high pop are almost impossible for a new player to get a proper start on.
Found someone's house and knocked on the door with no weapons drawn as I only had a rock, torch, and a spear.
The occupant opens the door and listens to me ask for food in exchange for wood.
He murders me with a sword.
I swear revenge.

I begin preparations. 
I searched barrels, boxes, crates, anything that could give me the tools I needed to avenge myself.
And it came to me.
A gracious barrel with a curious object.
A flamethrower.

I found just enough materials to repeair it and fuel it.
I made a few spears and found a grenade.
I found his house (again).

I waited until dawn to see if he would leave to forage the nearby ruins of an airfield.
He left.
With the door open.
The first mistake.

I began burning the wooden foundations with my fury and watched as it burned.
I entered the house after the first flames died down.
Bedrolls and beds in the open (respawn points).
I destroy them with my own sword.

I set the house aflame from within and watch.
It is the most beautiful sight my eyes will ever behold.

The owner returns.
The house is in shambles.
He fires a shell from his pipe shotgun.
He fails to kill me.
I throw my spear straight into his face.
He goes down.
"How does it feel to have your house burned down by the hands that you wronged?"
I strike the final blow.

13/10, would burn someone's house down in revengence again.
A naked man chased after me with a rock over his head begging me to stop running. When i finally ran to the edge of a cliff and turned around. He said, "Alright...OK.." then bashed my face in with said rock.

Another naked man asked "Are you an Expert Rock Fighter?" i shook my head no and i took my rock and bashed his face in.

This is what i have learned from playing this game. TRUST NO ONE and always strike first. May my male genitalia dangling over your corpse stand as a warning never to cross me and my rock again. Only the strong survive.
Rust will never be forgotten, and it will never be at peace. I told myself I would wait to do this review, that I would let it settle, that it would one day be finished and then I could write my thoughts. Well, too much time has passed for me to wait any longer, and for some reason, today seems to be the day.

I'm not even sure now how I discovered this, "new game with a cool idea". A friend, DayZ-exploring, a flashing Steam store page, who knows. But once I installed it, and loaded it up, I had found a new, exciting video game. The music when loading was incredible, eerie and atmospheric; and this was 'alpha' music? Once I loaded into the world, an island of apparent great size, I enjoyed the experience from the start. Nature, trees, vast distances, animals, ruins, and...people.

For that is what makes Rust tick, people. The first moment, not knowing whether to hide, fight, or try to communicate, is telling, and this is a common thread. And with these first moments, come the first deaths, both expected and not. And so comes the first rule of Rust, don't trust anyone. And with this rule comes the choice you have to make, do you strive to live a solo life? Do you have Steam friends that play and can band together? Or do you try to find some team to take you in? Be ready, you are going to die, a lot.

I made a shelter, and built, and harvested, and hunted. I ventured into dangerous places and survived. Or died. In the end, it was a great experience. Then came the version changes, at first it was good, bugs were fixed. Then, they started over from scratch, and things started getting different from what made it good in the first place. It was good, then bad, then good, then bad.

The game today is worse than it was, a new thing we are seeing in games when they are made to be a service. A game with a golden age, something we used to only see in MMOs. That is why I can no longer recommend this game. I am going to give it a thumbs up, because of my experiences, and that it was worth the money I paid, but now is a different time. Rust is over for me.

Graphics: 
Apart from certain updates and small periods, Rust has always looked fantastic. As they moved into Beta and the modern Rust era, the game both looks great, and takes a great system to run. It's one of the games that gets my PC as hot as it can get. Beware!

Sound:
Great music and sounds at first, but inconsistent sound production. Seemed like the staff never settled on consistant sounds/music during the process. To me, this shows a lack of focus, which has been clear from every player since the beta started. This developmental blurriness seems to coincide with when Rust had already made huge sales. Pretty much the team had success, and just went in slow-patch mode. It was less about a work of art, a work that could have defined the team of producers and developers for the rest of their lives, and more about making the project akin to updating the software in automatically flushing toilets.

Community:
It's a multiplayer game, and the community can be tight-knit if you're in good, but overall it's as toxic as it gets. The sadness with Rust comes from both the community and the developers. Nobody is happy, ever. This has bred conflict between players I've never witnessed before. In short, Rust has the worst community of players I have ever seen, and the clear lack of maturity in most players is almost depressing.

Overall: 
Rust was a pioneer, a flagship in a tattered lot, but what made it great also destroyed it. When new games are made in it's shadow, I hope that someone can capture that essence just once again, and hold it tight until a perfect time to share it with the world.

What i'm about to do give my review/experience in my days in RUST. NOTE that I have 1500 hours put into this game on my main account plus a few more on this account so im a long time rust player. Now on to my story and experience.


MONTH 1-2

There i was in the open field trying to figure out how to craft and make stuff. First shack I built I thought I was safe, no I was just a prey for players. They tore my shack down and told me if I wanted a room. Without clear thinking i said yes and soon after they trapped me in there house and I was made a slave. I joined another server and with a minutes I made myself a pipe-shotgun wooo!!!. As I went to farm i noticed 3 guys loaded with gear and heavy artillery. I thought this was a caveman game with no high tech weaponry, nope i was wrong when they shot that bullet in my face. Though i loved everything this game had going. A week passes and I find a hidden somewhat made base and without thinking again make my room right on top and start farming and making new things. Next day I wake up to find 2 guys building on top of the base I made and we have a short stare until they said they are sorry. They thought the base was abandoned. As I return from my farming routine I find a player stealing my stuff from the bottom part which I was going to use. His name was lunch  I took it to shoot him right away, but he shuts the door and managed to stay safe. We soon talked it out and made an agreement not to shoot each other. I trusted him and that was the start of a new friendship.


MONTH 2-3

My roomates on top dissapeared out of nowhere and in the end it was me and lunch. We did what any rust player does survive and find new things to make. Then we found a player named tanaka. He was a fellow rust player and could make bolt rifles so we made a deal to offer a trade. after the trade me and lunch were thinking, shoot...kill... I chose not to shoot him. The three of us form an alliance and go out hunting for people and yes its the most fun satisfying thing in RUST and I hate it. Everything was perfect until we encountered them. A hacker out of nowhere aimbotted us and from then on we were careful to go outside with valuable stuff because you never know when they will decide to aimbot you. That didn't stop me and lunch until a hacker found our base one day. Turned out he was a little boy and wanted our codes to our house. We said no and he aimbotted us and destroyed everything we had and took so long farming for. That is when we decided to go to a community server as we said bye to the rust players and tanaka.


MONTH 3-4

Nothing much to say but we just enjoyed our new rust community hacker free or so we thought. Even though there are admin there is a 50% chance that there is a hacker hiding his hacks or clipping inside houses when admin is gone. It was a fun time as me and lunch made new friends and enemies. Though as time went on less players showed up and thats when my good friend lunch left the game RUST. There i was alone but couldn't leave this damn game as i loved it so much. Yes i went back to the official servers and once started from scratch, or so i thought....


MONTH 4-9

There i spawned i saw the one person i remembered, the one I didn't shoot, the one me and lunch hunted with. Tanaka{Robin}. He offered me a bed and my own room and we chatted for awhile and thus i told him about lunch . Days went to weeks and weeks went to months and slowly me and robin were building more bases and trusting each other with our items. We decided to spend all our wood on at the hanger and thus in a few weeks the batcave was born. During these times i also gained reputation good and bad. Most loved me and I made more friends who would later help me with my enemies. Those that were my enemies called me nothing but a low hacker hiding my hacks. My other sort of rival to own lands was a clan named RST and a few encounters i had with them i shot without any say. Then came another man who i would get to know more as the days went one. His name was doc baby muncher. I didn't really talk to him that much but enjoyed his say when a plane dropped an airdrop. ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Me and robin didn't see him that much as he was in the other side of the map but he was an enjoyment. Everything was normal each day in RUST. Nakeds players, friends, hackers and more. FYI Doc refers the nakeds as hobos. Even later I slowly made friends with RST and respected them. REP(incinerator,pie,maddy). Then the horrible day came as me and robin encountered the servers first wipe.


Month 9-11

My love for Rust didn't make me leave,which i hate. NO, instead i went to another server and Rst was nice enough to lend me a small room. Heck i even saw doc and his ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Robin was with me but made a different base and in that short time EA3 was back and everybody returned. Though not everybody I once knew were there as some of my friends and allies left Rust. It wasn't long until Yes even Robin left right when the server came back up. You will be missed. Thus it was me and my rock. Though there i was addicted to this damn game playing and playing. The batcave was rebuilt,hackers were doubling and players started to vanish because of hackers. there i went solo for a while then one day Doc visited my base and introduced my to Mr ROtten. We went out to kill hobos and later i gave them a guest room. I enjoyed their company and they are one main reason why i stayed in rust more. From friendly player i was turned into an asshat, No we turned to ZE Asshats. I trusted even more and gave them the codes to my entire batcave and so came the chapter of me and the asshats. Then out of nowhere it came again, dam servers.


MONTH 11-PRESENT

New server new fresh start and new players. Me Doc and Rotten made a T tower and do what we do best which is snipe hobos. Its been a year and few months now and i'm slowly players are coming back though i'm not sure ill stay here any longer. I've been raided,c4ed, no clipped, befriended, Shot etc.. I have raided, killed, c4ed, and have done it all. I know every trick that rust has and still could possibly learn more things. RUST is a game that shows how you feel about players and what you are willing to do to survive. Rust has one main story and that is your story. I love this and and hate it at the same time. I will never forget how many friends i have made and friends that have left me. who knows i might have an encounter  with them again. This is my Story and history in RUST. I hope you will give this game a chance as developers are even making a new RUST. Thankyou and remember the name of the game is RUST not TRUST(sometimes).

Yar....

Alright, so here’s my 2 cents after almost 500 hours in the last few months
THE EXPERIENCE
-solo is essentially impossible if you’re playing near any populated rad towns. 
-don’t even bother playing on solo/duo/trio servers, they die after the first few days of wipe
-do not even consider playing on face punch servers, play on rustafied
-good luck getting on rustafied with their 200+ people waiting queue on wipe day 
-modded servers are pretty fun, 1.5x-2x is the way to go, anything above that and you’re not really having fun. (Essentially cheating in everything in the very beginning of a campaign. It just ruins the experience)

THE SCRAP GRIND 
-scrap grind isn’t necessarily that bad, but expiramenting on workbenches is awful
- there are 3 tiers of workbenches:
Level 1 has simple blueprints (cheap revolvers, ghetto shotguns, regular pistol bullets, simple stuff, unreliable explosives) 
Level 2 has higher tier blueprints (smgs, better pistols, semi auto rifles, better armor)
Level 3 is the endgame workbench with the best loot. (AK, explosive ammo, c4, rockets, rocket launchers, metal armor, sniper rifle) 
In the game there is expiramenting on the workbench, where you can get a blueprint that you don’t already have. This system for as it is is a gamble, and it’s pretty good for the lower level benches. Only 75 scrap for the level 1, and it’s actually pretty good for its price. If you don’t have the revolver (probably one of the most important guns in the beginning of the wipe) you can get the revolver, and then research the bullets that come with it. With the level 2 it is still pretty much worth it to expirament. Getting a semi rifle can really bridge the gap for you from being primal to getting good loot. The level 3 expiramenting is very iffy however. You can get really good items like the AK, bolt action sniper, metal chest plate and mask, etc. Researching on the level 3 is super high risk high reward. You on one hand have the possibility of getting an AK, one of the most powerful weapons in the game, or you can get incendiary 5.56 (rifle ammo that is stupid expensive, and nobody uses it) and you need to nearly get another level 3 workbenches worth of scrap to do it. 


THE PVP 
-Where do I start. PvP is awful on this game. 
-god awful stuttering, even with very good PCs
-pvp favors the client side, instead of serverside 

Let’s say you are watching someone go across an open field and suddenly they stop, great time to tap them right? Wrong. They for 1:
Aren’t frozen
Are yards ahead of what you see
Most likely already killing you.
PROJECTILE_INVALID Is your number one enemy while pvping

BASES 
- Nothing bad I can really bash this game about on their building side. The roof is just one big problem they need to get rid of completely 
-decay isn’t a problem unless you’re a 1 man inside a 10 man sized base 
-high external walls are a good way to scare people off; show that you mean business.

RAIDING
-three different kinds of raiding 
-onlining is pretty much only to prove a point. It is inferior to offlining, but it’s the gentleman’s way of doing it. It’s essentially impossible to succeed in, unless only a few are online and you are chocked full of explosives. The defenders can just build a wall and metal all your hard work in less than a second (seriously)
-offlining is the safer way to do it, but less noble way. You do this if you want loot. Nobody to defend the base, should be smooth sailing. The only problem are the counter raiders.
-raiding for the sake of being an asshole. These raiders grief bases. The place metal walls in inconvenient places, they wall off doorways, destroy workbenches. Please don’t do this.


DEFENDING YOUR BASE
-Rust is actually stressful, like seriously.
-you spend hours defending your base to make sure it doesn’t get offlined
- you wake up thinking “I really hope I haven’t gotten offlined”
-you stay up late to make sure nobodies schemin’
-it overall takes a toll on your sleep schedule, and it’s more of a chore to play rust than it is a treat.

HOW THE GAME WORKS 
The game is essentially like life. The harder you work in the begging, the better your life is in the end. 
If you grind all day every day in the beginning of wipe, you can spend your final days in rust not worrying about scrap, upkeep, etc. You can just raid and pvp. 
I’m too lazy to finish this review, I’ll do it later. Overall, it’s a pretty good game.
RUST. Ha Rust.

I love this game, or rather I *loved* it.

The game itself is amazing, great fun especially on some servers with active admins and sensible mods. The dev's are incredibility active with weekly updates, and the extended community of streamers and content creators is what made my attracted to the game in the first place. 

But the community. The community is toxic as hell. What started as a great game with amazing player interactions, the struggle to build and survive and even creating groups of players who previously didn't know each other. It was great. Now, its all about the PvP. Shoot on sight is the order of the day, and with the exception of RP servers, which are modded and have more rules than the tax man, player interactions are now simply "Shoot first, loot after". No talking, no making friends or meeting the neighbours. Constant  screaming or music blasting from local talk, and frankly I don't understand how anyone plays on high population servers without getting a headache. If you're not in a clan, you're not worth worrying about.

And developers; please, please, stop listening to Reddit. Its like a bunch of 13 year olds got together to pester you into creating CoD with buildings. That's not what made or makes Rust great. Those people are runing your game; some of your more recent changes are great, but still penalise solo players in favor of larger groups or zergs. 

I'm recommending the game in the vain hopes the community gets better (or the toxic morons move on to another game). We live in hope, we live in hope.
I have played for 20 hours and have only ever met two nice people.

I built my house on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean and a lighthouse, there was a base very close by that had at least five people living in it, I decided to ignore them seeing as every other person I had come across had killed me on the spot. After I built my house I finished it off with a painting on the front of the house, it was simply a drawing of a smiley face. 

It was starting to get dark at that point and I was in need of wood and mushrooms, so I headed out to go collect some, I must have been gone for at least 20 minutes, at that point it was pitch black outside. I reached my home to discover something had changed, my little drawing no longer existed, instead, it was replaced with the word "GOATKING", the background of the painting was red and the writing was black. I looked around to see if anyone was nearby, but not a single person was in sight. 

I entered my home and closed the door behind me, I went up the stairs and started my fire to heal myself and so that I could see as it was still dark. Once the sun came back up I opened my front door to discover a little brown bag on the floor right in front of my door, I picked it up and looked inside... It was a skull, a human skull. I did not know what to think, I was but a noob in these parts, so all I had to defend myself with... was a stick. Time went on and every now and then I would get another bag with a skull in it, I had no idea who was doing this and tried my best to catch them but I never even heard them in the first place. Until one night...

I was sat in my house and heard people running around outside, I peaked out my only window to see five people holding torches, they were standing in a line towards my house, they were all wearing the same clothing too, but what really caught my attention was their heads, they were all wearing some type of animal skull, like a deer or horse. They spotted me at the window and one of them started saying "Oooh-ahhh goatking" over and over again, the other four people also started saying the same thing shortly after, this went on for sometime, after a while they came up to my door, knocked and then left. There was no way I was opening the door so I just waited until daytime arrived.

Once it was light out I opened my door to discover two bags, one bag contained the usual human skull and the other contained clothing, the same clothing that the people were wearing outside my house last night. Did they want to recruit me? I ended up putting it on and carried on with my day by collecting some stone. I got back to my house and upgraded some walls to stone for extra protection. I left my house to discover that those people from last night had returned, and they now all stand right in front of me, I never even heard them outside, they told me to follow them back to their camp, which I did... It was a short trip because their camp was the house right next to mine, I had no idea that they lived so close but had never been over to their house anyway.

I entered their house and never left, as I write this I am still locked inside their home, they feed me human flesh and mushrooms every now and then but that's about it, I am locked in a room with two other people, they seem nice enough, we have gotten to know each other very well. I don't know what is next for us, but I pray that you don't make the same mistake...

Don't trust anyone in Rust. 


UPDATE: It turns out that one of the people that were kidnapped and in the room with me was part of some resistance group, long story short. A group of around 10 people came and saved us, they killed the members of the cult and set us free from the room of horrors, this group also took me back to their real camp and put me in their hotel for free. I recently got a knock at my hotel door, they have a postman too! He gave me a note that told me the upcoming weather and events that would take place at the camp, they're having a barbecue soon so that should be neat. 

Also this group is at war with another group.
1. Watch some YouTube videos.
2. Get hyped up.
3. Think it looks easy and you can manage.
4. Try it for your self.
5. Fail horribly.
6. Spit salt everywhere.
7. Rage quit.
8. Wait a moment to cool down 
9. Repeat :D

I like this game
I start.
Spawn in.
Nude, cold, helpless.
I come to a castle looking structure (obviously player made)
I go up to it and say the oblivious "Hello!? I'm friendly"
Meet some friendly guys out of the castle
They inject me with a green and white pen looking thing
Puts my health to 100
I get hit by a morningstar (or a mace if you want me to be correct)
100HP>20HP
"You are our slave now"
I accept my duty, as if I leave, I am sure of my death
They show me the contents of a box outside of the "slave quaters"
I find 7 human skulls and 3000 bone fragments..
I think to myself "Oh god, oh god, oh god.. Good one TeT look what you've walked yourself into this time"
I cannot call them by their steam profile names... I must call them masters or my death will be certain.
Masters say "We will now mark you as one of our slaves"
One of them bring out a longsword
I fall.. Bleeding, screaming..
All of them laughing hysterically
"You're life is now ours, and we now own you"
I accept my fate..
They take me inside the "slave quarters"
Wooden structure outside their stone castle
They show me to a 2 triangle foundation room.. Enough to fit a sleeping bag and thats it.
"This is your room"
They hand me a sleeping bag... I put it down in the small room.
They bring me out and tell me to wait
I wait for 15 minutes
They come back with a metal hatchet and a Metal Pickaxe.
"You get resources until we say"
I go out and come back each time they say.
*3 Hours of slaving for them*
They say "Come inside the slave quarters now!"
I am scared.. I don't think ive done anything wrong.. I mean.. All they fed me was raw human.. I've had to cook it myself..
I ready for death
I clutch my fists as hard as I can...
"Settle, slave.."
"We wanted to thank you."
"You have been the best slave yet, and yet you have got us enough materials to make our weapons and armors"
"And you keep coming back like a lost puppy"
....
I am utterly surprised..
"Come slave"
I follow what I think was the leader..
They open the door into the castle
I say "I cannot go into masters den... That is for masters!"
They turn to me.. guns pointed..
I think to myself "I am dead.. You are a complete fu...."
"Our den is now your den also.. We are inviting you into out lives.. No more slavery, you have proven yourself worthy"
I stay quiet, I'm not fully convinced..
They take me to the top of their castle
"Look at this view, Slave"
I look, it is free open land, the grass sways with the push of the wind, leaves rustle..
"You had many opportunities to leave and never come back, slave."
"But yet you came back.."
"We will now call you by your real name"
All of them together in collaboration "T-E-T"
"TET!"
"Will you join us into our endevours until death"
Woah, I think.. I can't belive this..
"I will follow you to the realms of hell, I will follow you to the end of the world, I will carry you over my shoulders for whatever how long miles, even if you have the slightest amount of luck to live.. You are my masters, I shall obey, I shall forever bow down to you"
"Come... TeT"
They take me to the loot room..
They hand me an AK.. Black hoodie, pants, boots, metal chestplate and mask..
"I can't take this"
"You are us now, embrace the look"
"Th..aaank you masters.."
"You don't have to call us masters anymo..."
Rocket hits the building..
Silence between us
I say "To the death"
All of them "To the death"
I freak out... I've never been in a real life battle before..
I spot 6
We are out matched..
Masters rush out will guns blazing..
They take out 2..
They are screaming their lungs out
I take deep breaths.. Heart is pounding..
I run out spraying for my life..
I hear the satisfying sounds on headshots of the enemies..
As I see their lifeless bodies limp to the ground 
70% Bleeding.. 
10HP..9..8
Masters still screaming
"I have you masters!"
I get them all up
"I will remember you all to the end.."
"My wounds need tending.. But this is too late"
I fall, screaming..
Masters scream
"YOU WILL BE FINE TET, PLEASE GET UP"
I see darkness settle in over my eyes
I just remembered the times I had with these guys
It's like life was flashing before me..
I hear the pounding of feet on the grass coming towards me
Darkness has now taken me
I am now free like the grass swaying in the wind..
I am now the leaves that rustled in the trees
"No..No...No... This can't happen!" In a deep depressing tone
I dreamt of him taking my facemask off and him holding me against his chest, crying...
"Come back TeT, this is not your end! Please come back like the old days"
I say with the lastness of my breath
"These are the new days.. Master.. I am free...... Th..a..nk you."
Masters are crying "Nooooo! Please come back, please, please! PLEASE!"
"You can't go yet! We have places to explore! Enjoy food together! Carry each other to the end!"

"Till death"

Thank you masters.. Too bad I couldn't get your name
It was fun..

To the end?

Would absolutely buy this game for the memories.
Thanks for reading!
I was playing the game earlier this week, while scavenging for supplies. I noticed faint shapes of other players in the distance..thinking "oh shit" i scurried away. little did i know they saw me and started to chase me.

A few minuets later i made a wooden shack in the middle of an open plain, for me to sleep in.
I awoke in the night to hear footsteps outside my door, scared and confused I peeked through the cracks of my shack..
Several naked men were trying to  break into my house and loot me.
Strange russian voices could be heard.
A minuet or so later they broke into my shack and i made a run for it...In the persuit I was running as fast as i could, only to be shot down by a naked mans bow and arrow, a few seconds later they caught up to me and started to gangbang my nearly dead corpse, while beating me with rocks and making really strange sex noises.....i must say that this is the most realistic Russian prison simulator ever.

10/10?
Rust.

- What it means to me - 

What is there to say. It started as a faster pace version of the game (mod) i love Dayz or well the Arma Operation arrow head version. 

Even though the game started as of what even garry Newman (the creator) said "a clone of dayz and STALKER" It has over the years turned in to something MUCH more. Rust in the start was the first game when it was only accessable to youtubers and other known people that i wanted to get into and when i finally got in to it damn i was hooked. 



Ever since the start i poured hours and hours in to the game loving every bit of it. I went from casually playing on the pc and more on Xbox too quitting on the consoles and playing PC. What im trying to say is that this game by a quite small developer team made me quit all other games to focus on this one.


- The Game - 



As refered to before, rust in the begining was a fast pace version of the arma mod (Dayz) with added features that had been missing like Base building and a way better combat system for gun-play. the focus of Rust was and is to build up your base and get "loot" and slowly climb from a primitive state to a more "advanced" state, aswell as pvp (player vs player) and raid you're enemies. Ofcouse thats my point of view and rust can be played however you like it farm, build, fight, make friends, "role-play" and much more. Thats the thing that makes this game so great, that you can really make it your own. 


- current farm/system- 

at the time of this "review" rust is in the component and bp system in witch you farm "scrap" aswell as find items in the wild to learn and then craft, this is imo the greatest change to the game it has made the early game alot slower then before, but not too slow like the XP system that was a few iterations back. It makes every item in the game feel more valuable and if you find that ak in a loot box you really care to get it back and it feels like a real loss if you loose it.



in rust you have you're general farming system when it comes to get materials like stone and wood and ore. You hit trees, farm rocks or hit metal and sulfur nodes to get them, there has recently been added a quite nifty mini game to make farming more fun aswell!

- the gun-mechanics - 


the gun-mechanics of rust and gun-play aswell as general pvp feels fluid and smooth in general at this time and date some items do need rebalancing and changes but thats why its in a early access stage still, im talking at the moment about the general feel of everything.

to compare rust to a few games i would say that rust is highly skill based like games like counterstrike, since they added spray patterns to alot of guns and generally removed alot of the aim cone issues (reduced) it feels like the gun play is really getting somewhere. all guns in the game have a durability before the break and different patterns, aswell as you need to craft your ammo , all the guns also carry out different stats that are suitable for different situations and cost a different amount in  materials to craft. This makes taking an "ak" out for instance will be better then a "waterpipe shotgun" but puts you in a higher risk of loosing alot more if you die. There is a WIDE variety of different weapons in the game, so you can really use what you prefer, like shooting a massive high damage high output machine gun?, like using primitive weapons like the bow or a spear? you can do that!

-- Building--

Rust has one of the most simple but most advanced building systems i have ever seen in a game of this type.

basically you have a building plan and a hammer, the building plan is used for, well to plan out your building with "twig" (can also be used in raiding situations). when building you can map out how you want you're base with triangles and squares for the foundation, which might sound very limited but belive me its far from it. 

You protect your base so other people cannot build and ruin it with a tool cupboard and can even put up traps and other items to make it safer. 

there is 5 different tiers of materials you can use to make your base out of and you can mix and match them twig (only really used for mapping the base, since it can be broken really easily), Wood (used in the start (quite easy to get and is easy to break but still usable in the start)  , Stone ( a great material but has a soft side and a strong side), metal (is great has a soft and strong side like stone but is much stronger, weakness is that people can look trough the sides of it) and armoured (stronger then every other type and has no real downside except that its much more expensive). 


-- Raiding -- 

Raiding probably the biggest thing about this game. Raiding in rust is very interesting and its what brings the most crazy situations aswell as the most fun and sad ones. 

most of the time when raiding your putting a lot on the line to get another group or persons stuff and sometimes house for your own. 

in rust there is a wide variety  of items to use just like the guns, you can use a rocket-launcher which has a high splash and damage rate which is the highest tier of raiding but is for the most part quite hard to come by in this current issue of rust, you also have C4, satchel charges explosive ammo and even things like the flamethrower, aswell as using items like pickaxes and melee weapons to break soft side of walls. 

when raiding you have the possibility to use ladders aswell as (currently) foundations and floors to get higher up on bases, there is also the possibility of "boosting" you're teammates by jumping on top of them. 


-- updates/devs/changes --


I recently gave rust "the labor of love" nomination on steam because ever since the release of the game it has consistently gotten updated and improved and for a LONG while the game has gotten updated every week, the devs of the game always listen and for the better or worse looks to the player base to see what is wrong with the game and they are very active on social media. The dev team have their own dedicated site where they can be contacted and post frequent updates on what they are doing in the form of dev blogs.

(not posting link since i dont know if that's allowed) 


- The issues - 


imma keep this section shor.


The only real issue with rust besides sometimes there being laggy servers and hit reg issues witch i dont really consider issues since i know they will be fixed before the game leaves early access.

The only and main issue is the life time of servers before the "die" most servers (it has gotten better and devs are aware) live for about 3-5 days before they start dying out. most people after the first few days just wait for the next update that's on thursday. 

-- conclusion -- 

There is alot u haven't talked about thats in the game like how you can paint or that there soon* will be cars in it or that you can farm and forage and that is because i dont want to make this "review" longer then it has to be. I also want to make it clear that this is my point of view and that others may think different and have other opinions and that i might have missed things.

When it comes down to the question should you get rust? in my opinion even though its a hard game to get into and also to get into if you are alone its an experience that i belive everyone should try aswell since its 50% off on steam atm! 

--


if you have any questions or want more info feel free to add me! 

i also just wanna say sorry if i spelled alot wrong (im not a native english writer/speaker) 

i also wanted to say that even this might be a quite long review its noware near all the opinions and things i want to say.


This will be one hell of a game.With all the upcoming new contents and features, it'll sure be a masterpiece.Highly recommend for people who are searching for a survival game in the wilderness.You have a good friend or maybe 2-3 who would like this too? Ask them to enjoy it with you! Together, it's much more fun.The first 2 ingame days maybe a pain, but with friends you can easily build things up.If you are more the "solo survivalist", no problem! Search for a hidden place, maybe behind some big or small mountains where its unlikely that someone in the next days will come.Build your little shelter for the first ingame week and begin to harvest wood to begin to build you dream survival house.Let's go hunting! First for animals, then for humans.Better don't run up the streets the first week without a gun.Things can change very fast.A sunny wood harvest day can easily be a struggle when doing so.But check it out yourself! Résumé: Rust is an absolute blast when it comes to a survival game!
I've had Rust for a week at the time of writing this review / guide. I have 50hrs at this point.
What follows is a review of the various stages of your rust play-through, from wipe to wipe.

In the beginning:
- You are given a randomly generated character, and spawn naked and afraid. 
I am a black male, finally I can use BBC in my online rust dating profile.
*If you can't handle this point, do not pass begin, do not collect 200 wood, GTFO. 

- You have a rock and a torch, they are used to bash trees, animals, rocks and hordes of preteen nakeds that chase, and kill you for no reason. Be careful! Trust no squeakers! And if you come across someone who doesn't kill you right away...BE CAREFUL! They are cunning and probably have a deeper, more mature psychopathic nature. 

- Once you gather enough wood for spears, stuck a few naked preteens to death, and move your way up the food chain, you'll need a place to stash your goodies. Location is very important, you will need access to basic resources like fresh water, stone and wood, but also isolated enough to not attract the older, more geared players that will level your base and put you in the middle of their circle jerk while chanting "whats good ma dude" to completion before killing you...Then picking you up saying "sorry brah, my bad, sorry man, want to join us?" IT'S A TRAP! They will kill you after 5 seconds whether you respond or not.

- Now after getting your tits pushed into the dirt a couple of times, or in my case, an impressive BBC (A couple times being an understatement) you will establish a little 2 x 2 house that's quite isolated, some food in the chest, a nice pickaxe, hatchet and a roaring furnace. You might even be so lucky as to have a friendly neighbor. Well done, you have made it further than you would have for about 10 hrs of your initial gameplay. Don't let this discourage you from getting the game though! Or do, you salty noob. 

The Middle:

- Now that you've ticked off two to three of Maslow's tiers it's time to have some fun.

- You will need to grow your arsenal and this can be done in a few ways depending on your skill set:
a) Do you like exploring and avoiding danger? Night time rad town runs might be for you!
b) Do you like adrenaline rushes and close calls with death? Killing geared players on their rad town runs might be for you!
c) Do you enjoy asserting your dominance over others, puffing up your own ego over those that clearly are helpless against it? Raiding the nakeds might be for you! *use of the "What's good ma dude?" slogan is optional.
d) Are you a PVP god and enjoy using the terms "Get Rekt" and "360 no scope"? Raiding other big boy clans might be for you! *A YouTube channel to upload tutorials on how to 1 v 5 is optional.

- Expect to get raided! No matter how isolated you are, how strong you think you are or how many slaves you've forced into hard labor on your hemp farm, there will come a time when you get raided. If you are lucky, your base could hold them off for long enough while you and your human shield of slaves fight them off, with all your cleverly placed traps, your double stacked foundations and your triple stacked walls. In most cases, however, you will get a rather efficient, high pressured enema that will usually take place when you are out shopping IRL.

- The aftermath of a raid: Once you come back to an empty house, you will go through the five stages of loss. Namely denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The only part we will discuss is acceptance, provided you didn't destroy your PC in stage 2. There are really only 4 options after a raid, and that again is dependent on your skill set:
Type a) players: Pick up your sleeping bag, if you still have it, and jog on. 
Type b) players: Learn the weak spots of your base, rebuild, and hope your online next time they come so that you can defend yourself.
Type c) players: Find a naked, take over their base and relocate. It is very important that you wait for the poor naked to come back to the base and beg for some of their gear back, make sure you only reply with "Why so salty" before giving some gear back, and then proceeding to kill them.
Type d) players: This is what stirs your coffee! Call your boi's and start recording! It's time to make a counter raid video!

-The end:

Regardless of the server you choose, one thing is certain. All maps will eventually wipe. All your hard work, all the times you've laughed, you've cried, it all gets wiped like the blackboard of your maths class. What was it all for? What did you learn? Was it worth it? Will I ever use that knowledge in the future?

In short. No.

There is only a brief moment in time when you will be on top, or at the bottom, depending on your preference.
One thing is for certain though, whatever you choose, it feels GOOOOOOOOD.
I can best sum it up as a heroin rush, followed by addiction and hatred for yourself and your life choices.

If you're gonna buy Rust because of this review, and you didn't type TLDR, then welcome!

*Edit: I've now been re-rolled as an asian dude. I no longer have BBC rights, I now have a micro penis. This is a sad day for all my honies.
Rust is a very fun and enjoyable game ONLY IF:
-You have a group of friends to play with and if you want to be strong it has to be more than 3 players in a group.
-You have to play in certain servers. Rust used to be filled with cheaters and I am pretty sure there still are some. If you dont play in a server with active admins or any higher authority, it can be very frustrating.
-You have to be ready to devote your time into this game. If you have school the next day or work, don't play. You need about 3-4 hours to start yourself up. Finding food, getting clothes, finding supplies, and etc. Getting wood is a lot of work and finding a place to camp is also very hard. Your playing needs to be very consistent.
This game also has a lot of douchebags. Say hello get shot. Give food get shot. Have nothing but a rock get shot. Breathe get shot. 
I think the only way Rust can sky rocket themselves into a successful era is if the creators are active and they put up more offical servers and roleplaying servers. 
(This review was written by a 17 year old boy who used to ditch school to play this game. So yes I do recommend)

Rust is a game that delivers as a true survival experience.  In Rust you may choose to play alone or with others to survive, build, and loot.  The game is at its best on its community servers as the official ones tend to be overly crowded and very intense for a beginner.  In Rust you spawn in a random area of the very large map with nothing at your disposal but a rock, a torch, and bandages (Depending on the Server).  With that rock you begin your seemingly overwhelming journey of gathering supplies, supplies allow you to create tools, and buildings.  From there most players choose to explore their surroundings and upgrade their defenses.  

This game while enthralling is a time consumer and requires a lot of your attention, other players can kill you and loot your corpse.  I've spent hours upon my intitial spawn working in a community of players building a small city and upgrading to metal walls.  We traded supplies, hunted together, looted nearby rad towns, and even slowly accepted new players into our ranks.  Our small group had become a society, we aided those who needed help and defended our small city from other players masked as bandits.  We had come to know each other by first names and trusted that our things be safe while not ingame, as there was always another player on watching over your city.  

This game is perhaps the first game to create a challenging but engaging true to life experience.  Things I had never experienced in a game before such as trying to decide amongst your fellow founding members if the lone newbie could be trusted behind our walls?  Do we let him in?  Should we make him bunk in the Newbie quarters overnight until he pulls his own weight?  Are our walls truly safe?  Who should be allowed to carry rifles?  How can we expand our society and truly be able to keep our loot safe?  All of these questions come into play at any given point.  

Play with the right people, on the right server, and you too can have this experience.  As for that society?  What led to our unavoidable demise?  One lone player trusted behind our walls was able to level everything in just a few hours.  That is part of the game though, that experience, is what defined for me what games should be aiming to deliver a one of a kind experience I can experience nowhere else.  

Your experience may vary, your story may differ, but mine definitely enables me to recommend this game to the average player.  

If you enjoy working hard at something, having a totally different survival experience, definitely buy this game.  

*I can't recommend this to someone who enjoys a quick shooter game or fast paced experience, it is slow but the rewards are so much greater.

I got somewhat 500 hours in this game and i just decided to write a review for it.

Game has a lot of potential, some of it hidden. Rust is better played in a group of 3 to 5 on a medium or big server with constant rivals at your doors and glitches on your back. It's been in early access for quite some time now but unlike other games, this one actually has updates (weekly). Devs aren't afraid to change gameplay mechanics to see how it plays out in the end, this is Early Access after all. So, how's the game up close?

Gameplay is simple in its basics. Just survive. Kill, build (optionally, tho, you can even survive without a base), farm (a lot, especially if you're alone) and do whatever you want. Currenly, as of beginning of 2017 there is no end-game content or any specific objective to do. Most people tend to raid once they have reached a certain level of development; some just build the biggest and baddest base around and stay in it, occasionally killing someone from their roof and most of the players are engaged in pvp content, whether they want it or not. No one is protected from having his аss handed to him just because he made a wrong turn in the forest and walked up on a gang of 3 ruskies with ak's and full armor. This is why the game is best played in group, that way you can have an actual objective in game - to have fun together, instead of just building a base or raiding someone.

Graphics, optimisation, all of that are changing constantly and for some the game would be unplayable, but that's only if you have a very old pc. Currenly, i'd have about 40 fps on high on r9 270x and i5. But since it's early access and unity together, means that there are a lot of bugs and nothing can save you if you suddenly freeze during a firefight. Happens occasionally.

Sound - eh, it's alright. Music - eh, turned it off.

Social interactions - knock a door, press V and scream SUKA BLYAT SUDA IDI NAHOOY, get rekt.

Potential - a lot, if devs keep on updating as they are, game will (probably... hopefully) leave ea with a lot of content and ready to conquer steam charts.
Spawned in server, 30 seconds later shot in the head. I think to myself why did i buy this game? I contemplate even respawning but i do. Only to be greeted by a man named Pablo. Pablo was a man of many talents, he took me under his wing and told me to follow him back to his base. I was not anticipating getting locked in a jail cell along with many other fresh spawns beside me, each in their own cell. Each cell had a window and i was on the ground level of the compound. I looked outside, we were surrounded by high stone walls and there was no way for anyone to get in and rescue us i thought, I was wrong. That night i heard explosions and looked out as i saw a wall come crashing down before me, it was a group of 3 people, but they were no match for Pablo, he shot all 3 but not before 1 chucked me an AK through the window... I wondered what i could do with this, could i kill Pablo having only played the game for half an hour? I waited for him to come with food and i launched my attack, he opened my door and i shot him in the head. I looked in his corpse and saw something i never thought i would, he was holding the rocket launcher the 3 men used to break through the walls previously. 7 Rockets were also there, i ran to the exit and blew out, using 4 of the 7 rockets in the process, Pablo was outside, i used a 5th rocket and blasted him. 2 left. I look to my left, there it was, the hole in the wall but i wanted more revenge, i decided to head further into the compound using my last 2 rockets to blast through a wall which had Pablo's sleeping bag and Tool cabinet in it. I struck gold. I authorised myself and destroyed Pablo's sleeping bag - I was now the ruler of Pablo's prison. I then did the same to Pablo as he did to me only to be raided by another group of people and lose my prison, the cycle repeats itself. 10/10 Would be imprisoned, take over the prison, and lose the prison again.
If you ever thought about buying this game, let me give you some advice. For the first couple hours you play this game, mute voices. Trust me, you don't want to listen to little kids who are either roof camping or running around with a group of 6+ talking shit about you when you die. Don't get stressed out about not having a gun in first hour. The game takes patience. If you like to PvP, then yea, you should have a gun by the first hour, but if you like to build, dont worry about the gun. Just farm resources. Also don't get discouraged if you got raided offline. It just means that who ever raided you was to much of a pussy to raid you online because they know they would lose to you. Unless you live in a 2x1 base then yea, you're at fault there. When just joined a new server, don't bother farming for stone and stuff, just get some tools, and farm scrap. Because by chance you could get a gun from a box and then you would want to research it, this also gives you the opportunity to know who are the nice people and who are fuckers who like to roof camp or zerg up. 

So overall, its not a bad game, there are some try hards, there are some dicks, but that's every game that is open survival.
With friends, Rust is an absolutely wonderful experience. You get together, you pool your effort and resources, and you build structures and defend them as a team. There are many games out there that share similar concepts, but none of them pull it off quite like Rust does.

Unfortunately, if you do [i]not[/i] have friends, expect the game to be a long, miserable slog where any progress you make toward moving up in the world is quickly stomped out by those in power and you end up dying alone. Just like real life.
Step 1: Wake up on beach
Step 2: Gather Supplies
Step 3: Build Base
Step 4: Farm Barrels
Step 5: Happy with progress log off
Step 6: Log back on to awake on beach
Step 7: Frantically run to base
Step 8: Cry because your 40+ hours was for nothing

11/10 Farming Simulater
*walked up to someone*
me: Hi sir, how do i drink water? I'm new to the game
him: Oh hi there, yeah just follow me there is a river down here you can just sit down and press E to drink
*gets to the river*
*crouches down to drink*
me: oh thanks man, i really needed that.
*gets headshotted*
him: you're welcome.

10/10 experience.
If you don't eat, drink or sleep in real life this game is perfect for you because you won't need to do any of those things because Rust will take over your life.
In Rust you'll have neighbors that could wipe you of the face of the server, but choose to give ya a pickaxe & hatchet to help you start off. Then you'll have people who will use more materials to kill you than you have on you, why? Because Rust has given them this post-apocalyptic world & all they have are their life experiences to aid them in it. Your little bads & little goods in the real world turn into big bads & goods in here. Choose to be the people's hero or snake your way into their good graces, then plunge the dagger so deep into their backs they'll think twice about every new friend from that point onwards.  You can have it all, in a next to impenetrable water base that lasts you all the way till server wipe or you can have nothing, barely able to find some measly cotton to make a f**kin sleeping bag. Just like life in Rust you learn things the hard way, only this time you'll enjoy yourself a little more ;)

Summary: I fend off a group of russians from my base with an AK47, then break into their base and steal all their shit while naked from the waist down.
An open world multiplayer survival game sporting monthly updates that are sure to keep you playing in the next wipe. 
This game is unique in its wipe mechanic, meaning that on the first Thursday of every month, when the update hits, every server and map are reset completely and players start from ground zero once again. This ensures that everyone has a fighting chance in this game and you won't have to worry about going against players with endgame content while you yourself have but a stone spear while keeping the game feeling fresh.

I would highly recommend this fun yet challenging game for anyone looking for an online survival experience! 


I'm not going to lie, you're going to die in this game. A lot. You are going to be shot on sight. You could even have your base which took you weeks to build, be gone in seconds. Welcome to Rust.

Rust is a fascinating experience and also a frustrating one, you could be winning big or losing hard in a matter of seconds. Yet I somehow keep coming back to this game time and time again. The base building is incredibly cool and all the stuff you can place and design makes it feel like your very own personal base. The weapons are all neat too, with guns being very rare, while more primitive sharpy things are pretty common. I wouldn't get to attached to your weapons though, you might lose them.

Not only your weapons, your base can be lost as well. Raids happen, but if your base is small enough they might leave you alone. Might.

All right, all right; should you buy this game? Yes. It's still being updated and you learn as you play. For a patient person like me, I've learned a lot and have been successful at soloing. Teaming makes it even easier. If you're all in, make the purchase, if not I wouldn't.



1000 Hours on this game, never got bored of it.
I wish I could penetrate my arse with an amnesia screwdriver and re-live the time I started on this game..
11/10 Would start over again, and again.
Step 1: Learn to love your rock.
Step 2: Try to show other people the good sides of your rock.
Step 3: Take their belongings.
Step 4: Try to avoid rocks that ain't your rock.
Step 5: Never throw your rock otherwhise it's going to be Rock n' Roll.

[b] 10/10 [/b] would smash other naked's heads with my rock again without feeling guilty.
As of now, I have 663 and I feel like I can review this game:

Many of you may have the question, "Is Rust worth a buy in 2019?" ...  My response to this is why do you want Rust?  As of 2019, Rust is a pretty fun game and it WAS simple, until things such as the electricity update came.  Facepunch had a really, really, REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY fun game.  How this all ties into my review is the issue with this game. at the moment is the unfair skill gap really f**ks players in the a** and causes people to quit.  If you were like me and never knew what Rust was until you looked up a video and found "SALTIEST MAN IN RUST" or "RAIDING KOREAN ZERG BASE", you would think this game looks pretty fun.  Yes, if you like the farm and you like early game/mid game/end game skill gaps, this game is for you.  This game is one of the BEST games I have ever played, but it came with lots of downfalls.  I have broken countless mouses, keyboards, and headsets (one monitor lol) when I died in a raid or if I was countered.  I am going to be straight-up when saying, YOU ARE GONNA BECOME SUPER MAD AND SUPER ABSORBED BY THIS GAME.

However, I would not like to bash on this game.  This game is super fun and great when you have friends or meet new friends overtime.  This game is always changing with things such as the Cargo Ship update and the Chinook Update, both in which were great and added LOADS of PvP.  This game is looked at a lot by Facepunch and is a game that has loads of care, time, and effort put into it.  NEW PLAYERS READ THIS ----->  JOIN A SMALL, 1X SERVER.   YOU WILL BECOME LESS MAD AND WILL LEARN ALL OF THE GAME MECHANICS.

Overall, this is a yes for me.  I have met countless people playing this game.  I have had some of the best plays and the best in-game memories playing this game.  You will love this game, but you need lots of time and one or two friends.  Hope you all enjoy.
Rust definitely isn't for everyone.  If you're into survival, naked people, and being able to build anything from a small shack to a large compound with very little limitation on HOW you build it, then this game might be for you.

The game throws you into the wilderness with little more than a rock.  Use this rock, to help you gather supplies until eventually you go from that naked guy with a rock, to the dude with a big metal mansion, full armor, and a bunch of guns.  

Depending on the server you are in, there might be tons of supplies/materials or very little, and there might be lots of PvP to almost none.  Personally, I enjoy building and hunting so I've found myself a server with lots of materials/supplies and almost no PvP.  For those who want to kill other players though, believe me, it won't be difficult to find a server that caters to you.
Rust can be a great, fun, and amazing game. But sometimes Rust can be a game that makes you wanna punch your fucking wall. Iʻm sure everyone knows that the community is a fucking hellhole, practically every person I meet on this game is a slur spitting trash talking asshole, but the community can also be amazing, Iʻve met some real good friends of mine on this game. The gunplay is amazing, and I love the graphics of the game and aesthetics of the guns. The whole mining system is cool, but itʻs not really my cup of tea. If you like Minecraft, you would probably like this game. To those new to Rust, the first thing you wanna do is try to make a friend, with a friend to teach you about the game it can be really fun. I first started without anyone, and it was really hard for me starting out. I wouldnʻt say the game is worth what it asks for, Iʻd say itʻs a 20 or 25 dollar game. To everyone that has just bought this game and is having a bad experience, I would advice you to take a break and try the game again in a couple weeks/months. Whenever I do that it really helps, and watching other people play Rust helps too. Thanks for reading my review on Rust, hope that you (Yes, you, the person reading this right now) have a great morning, day, afternoon, evening, or night.

Woke up on the beach and got approached by a dude asking me to join his crusader group. I did, he gave me a bucket helm, armor and a sword and told me that we are going to charge together just to kill a group of 3 people with guns

A very good strategy survival game. It has a nice touch to it. You spawn in, get a bunch of stuff, start doing good, then die to someone that has better stuff than you, or you just get killed by a clan. But somehow, the game finds out how to make that fun. And the price tag is most definitely worth it. 8/10, would recommend.
Yes I am new, and I've only had this for 4 days as of writing this and have only 24 hours in, however I love this game.
I originally was frustrated with constantly dying and being setback, but at one point or another I just learned that it wasn't a big deal to be killed. I set up a base and was repeatedly killed but got back up and kept going. As of now, that base still stands, a whole floor taller than it used to be.

I met a friend early on and we built a base, but were locked out and killed. We learned to get locks on ASAP. We built another base further away, we enjoyed it, we killed a kid with a gun so we had one then. Killed someone threatening to bring a flamethrower. At midnight, my wifi crashed. Apparently he had come with a flamethrower and burned the base. I learned to quickly get down a sheet metal door on the interior and go for stone ASAP.

The next day I went in solo. I settled down and built a base. It was a peaceful area. Built a stone base, my innermost door was sheet metal with a code lock. Someone burnt down the wooden door but luckily they couldn't get much further in. I rebuilt a sheet metal door in its place. Nobody bothered attacking it again.

Next day same server, I was desperately trying to get a blueprint for a gun. I kept going out not too far onto the road and farming for scrap. The same kid would kill me and each time I would beg for mercy. I gave up begging and this is the shifting point when I realized that begging won't change anything, I'll die regardless. [b] Might as well get used to dying. [/b] The next day I was greeting my new neighbors because I shifted to a friendlier tone. Might as well try to make friends with those attempting to kill me. [b] Try to get as many people as you can to not KOS [/b]. I ran across someone I thought was a naked, and warned him about the bad guys. This little gesture saved me, as he happened to be the leader of one of the largest clans in the server. 

He told his friends and slaves not to attack me and they have, but solely because of mistaken identity and then proceeded to give me bandages and apologize. Without them, I wouldn't be as far as I am now. As of the time I am writing this, I befriended them yesterday. Today they continued their peace with me and I am so thankful for it. 

[b] TLDR; [/b] The community may seem toxic at first and a large portion is, but an equal portion is friendly. Don't trust anybody, but don't NOT trust anyone. TRY to make friends, not enemies. I honestly suggest this game as of now and enjoy the hell out of it. The server is the reset is the one thing I am not anticipating, but it may teach me more yet again. All mistakes are just lessons in this game. 

I like it, although, I wish that the Facepunch network wide updates and wipes were every two months instead of every month, but yeah, I do recommend it to anyone who likes PVP games...
Very fun game, if you manage to find yourself a group of players or even a friend to play with i highly recommend this game, i don't have many hours in, but i wish to put more hours into the game whenever i can. Was a solo player for nearly 80 hours of the game until i found a clan to join and they showed me the ropes and made my experience extremely fun. 100% recommend to anyone looking at buying.

Cons: really needs to be more optimized.
Toxic AF (but its all fun and games) 
learning recoil can be a pain in the back side
I have lost numerous braincells through this game and have lost all my friends because of it, no one loves me anymore and I am now on the streets sucking weener for cash







12/10 would do again
I bought this game years ago, but could not play it because of my potato PC. I built my first PC a year and a half ago and started playing all my favorite games on ultra, yet Rust sat in the corner covered in dust, never having earned a chance. One day I sat at my computer with my friends in Discord, scrolling through our game list deciding what to play next. I spotted Rust and thought "you know ill give this thing a try." I played for a bit and loved it. I loved it so much I bought 4 of my friends copies so they could play with me. 

Pros:
Wipes make the game fresh and new
Monthly updates with great content
Be a savage murderer, shop keep, raider, RPer, PVPer, whatever
Learn all new types of accents because no one talks with their normal voice
Excellent PVP, gun mechanics, melee combat
Good early, mid and late tier progression
Tons of servers with vanilla/mods
A random naked man credit carded my ass cheeks with an ID card

Cons:
You will die a lot, it is kill on sight for the most part
You will be stressed, thinking about your base and your loot on the days you cannot log in
Upkeep is kind of annoying, but I understand its role
Large groups make some servers hard to play on, but if you search around you will find your server

Buy the game, learn to deal with the stress and rage, and I promise you will have fun.
I like the idea. I don't mind the graphics. I like the crafting. In most ways, this is a pretty good game. But I hate the players. Only play this with friends or figure out how to play without dealing with other players.
RUST, itself is a riddle.

You CANNOT trust NOBODY.
You DIE if you TRUST - Then you will RUST
LOOTED and then BOOTED.

Even in the earliest times of the game, you will find from start to finish. Game is addictive,
you will curse, fear and even betray others - Just like they do to YOU.

The concept of the game is simple - Survive!!!

Shoot, kill, loot and do just about anything to anyone you find.

Like one of my friends say - RUST not TRUST.

If you like a drama series, come and play....
If you like a thriller series, come and play....
If you like a suspense series, come and play...
You like Horror and Fear, come and let it steer...
You like Romance, there might be even a BROmance....

Otherwise, just join for some fun, and GOOD times....

In short, sweet words. WELCOME to RUST.

See you soon...

A fat naked man with his penis flailing in the air tried to beat me to death. I shot him in the head and he screamed at the top of his lungs. It was beautiful buy this game, or your missing out big time.
Really brought me back to my days on xbox live where 12 year olds were telling me how they screwed my mother, I'd gladly recommend this game to anyone, it's beyond fun. my boss calls it better graphics minecraft, what 9 year old wouldn't be sold??
I've given Rust a while before i wrote a review on the title. And i've gathered a lot of information so if you are looking to buy the game you'll like this list of pros, cons, and types of playing you'll find then my own description of the game itself.

[h1]Pros;[/h1]
1. The Open world is procedurally generated which means, random loot, random spawns, random loot, exc.
2. The game offers puzzles and missions along with the open world that creates more content within itself.
3. The ability to build basically wherever you want and in any shape you want.
4. Constant new updates providing more content.
5. Thousands of servers run both my the rust staff themselves and modded/boosted community ones.
6. The game looks great and has continued to get better performance and graphic overhauls and the game has progressed.
7. A great UI that is very easy to navigate.
8. Crafting that makes sense.
9. You can be anything.

[h1]Cons;[/h1]
1. Too many toxic 12 year olds screeching reeeee when they kill a naked with a rock.
2. Not being able to change resolution of screen take (full, windowed, exc) after you have launched the game.
3. Glitchy doors that will throw you inside of a wall. (im nitpicking tryign to find 5 things bad about the game lol)
4. No Lore released about the world itself.


I couldn't find five things about it really but this is my take on how the game was supposed to be and what it has become.

Rust was originally made as an open world survival game in which players prospered, we were all friendly, you could walk up to someones base and ask to join, you could farm without being killed every 14 minutes, you could get help taking down heli or the apc, you could share things, you could talk to players, You could build a real community within the game.

But now... 98% of players kill on sight, if you walk up to a 1x1 you'll get speared to death, you now get killed every 3 minutes when farming, if you ask for help they will turn on you or just take you stuff, if you share you will be raided because they will know you have more, you can talk to other players but again... 98% of them will screech reee in you rear before killing you, and if you try to build anything... You will be raided.

I give rust a solid 10/10 on build quality.
I give rust a solid 4/10 on community quality.
I give rust a solid 9/10 on graphics quality.
[spoiler]Overall i give rust a 7/10[/spoiler]

Rust is a fun game , but needs lot more work , game is buggy and rewards large groups of people.
And community is very aggressive and toxic.
Its fun when you have atleast 4 friends, but if you want to play solo you will suffer.
Game is very grindy, and thats not for everyone.

Rust. What an amazing game, if you take out all of the screaming kids. toxic adults and racist players, it's basically minecraft (with better graphics)
On the serious side however, it is an amazing game. Endless hours to be played, different bases to be made, lastly. That black kid you met named Trey. (Be nice, he has a basketball game tomorrow, he's a point guard, and boy does he have shoot game.) So come play Rust, be sure to stay. Don't forget the things I say, hurry up and install rust today.
Rust is a very good survival game, the combat is pretty satisfying, yet not easy. Gun play is tactical and if you go against someone who is more experienced you will most likely die, adding an incentive to practice and play more to just have a chance of getting that lost loot that you may have worked hours for. I will admit there were many frustrating nights of losing almost 5-6 hours worth of loot due to just going offline, or by trying to transport it to a better base, but I quickly tried to either get revenge or work it all back so i could make my way in the world that is rust. Rust is unforgiving, challenging, and most of all rough on you. But if you can make it past all that, you will grow to love this game and the few people who are friendly. I cannot recommend this game enough, and remember, shoot nakeds on sight ;)
Rust: a game where people ask if you want a gun and then "give" you it by headshotting you and looting all your goods for recycling. In summary, they don't know the difference between the firearm itself and ammunition, in their heads it's all just "gun."

No but really, it's a fun game which I love for it's take on survival, but one I hate for it's difficulty to progress alone. Basically, play with a friend and learn to trust nobody. If someone asks if you want something for free, just leave (or fight, since you'll die anyway).

10/10 respawn simulator
I got this game 2 years ago when it was on sale for 19.99 but my PC could not run it so i asked for a refund.
I just recently got a new PC and watched some videos about rust on YouTube and tought i might give it another go and i absolutely love it. The game is very beautiful and even though the community is toxic I still had a great time.
The game is very demanding but if you have a good PC i say go for it. I had a blast raiding and grinding and playing whit my friends.

So far a fun game to play. I lean much towards the builder type of person then the raiding type of person. So im pretty much playing on PvE based servers and find them quite enjoyable. Especially with the new electricity system its fun to learn and explore and experiment with all the new stuff.

Looking forward to further improvements and releases, wich will make it more fun :)

The game could use some fine tuning on their performance though, since the game tends to lag-spike sometimes in frame drops, i hope they'll optimize it more in the future to have it properly functioning.
Rust is a very entertaining game, and has a lot of aspects that go into it. I highly recommend this game you are looking for a pvp/survival experience.
A MUST HAVE GAME!!!

I Love Rust, everything about it, the fact that you can lose it all, and also get lucky and make it big. I've got over 300h of play time on rust and i don't see that number slowing down any time soon. Each wipe presents you with new challenges and with one of the saltiest communities it make for a unique experience, satisfying revenge and great pvp battles.

The second you leave your base, you must be willing to lose EVERYTHING on your character, which i love, adds to the emotions and it gives the game incentive.
Rust is amazing. The graphics are shit and needs alot of work, the're bugs in the game that don't make much sense. But the game is amazing for the concept that it holds. The fact that it allows you to tap into your darkest nature is amazing. You can realy have mixed play throughs in this game. From being a naked on the beach then killing a semi geared guy with a rock of all weaopns is just fun. Insta dooming a farmer and getting all the loot that took hours to farm is so cool. When you meet a player who friendly and you team up only to realize that your new friend is reking it is fucking awesome. Rust can have quiet random content and the fact that you can do anything or that anything can happen is amazing. But be warned the game is hardcore you can be a asshole to anyone and get away with it or anyone can be a asshole to you and you can't do anything about it. You just have to deal with deez things in the game. friendlynes is not realy rewarded but you can get good gameplay out of it. You can play the game how it's to be played or you can just fuck around with players. It never gets boring or old. 8/10 for sure not for the easy triggerd people.
okokok, where do I start?

I'mma start with the most obvious critic point: "this game is toxic"

Yes, yes it fcking is, if you're a sensitive person who still has faith in humanity... you either not wanna play it, or accept the fact that this game will change you.

"You have no chance as a soloplayer"

You do have a chance, just don't expect any help or trust from someone, give them a gun and they will 100% shoot you.
I've been playing solo ALL THE TIME, try to become friends with your base neighbors and you'll be fine.

Now some quick info about the game
-you will die A LOT
-you will get raided and you will have to start from zero again
-you will be surprised about how toxic the players actually are
-you will at some point be the person who is geared up and is able to raid others and you will enjoy it
My only real gripe. Character models are pretty sub par. You could do a little better on them. Other than that, no real issues to complain about. Fun game. killing 15 year olds in this game couldn't be any more fun.
Rust is absolutely awesome...... But not for everyone lol. Rust is like an EX GF who cheated on you but you still love her.  You know one day your going to wake up to being screwed in this game but you love it and keep on going.  Ten you forgive her and start over. 

Rust is a game that requires time to be invested and knowing that everyone around you is there to screw you over.  If you can't invest time then you won't succeed.
Solo is very easy to master you just need time to get it, Duo is great and a lot more fun with friends you know. Trio or more is sometimes bad if you get into a fight but usually funny and just an overall great time, love the game loads of action. I would recommend it to any and all hardcore or softcore gamers.
100% off the charts game. Rust has a fun filled multiplayer exspernece including, bulding huge bases, forming huge clans, and haveing all out warfare with your freinds. If you love mutiplayer, action packed, and survial games rust is for you.
Rust is my favourite game, it is an awesome experience and the game functions very well, new updates come out frequently and there are events whenever there is a holiday (christmas/halloween) the game is always improving and now the game is very competitive. the only downside is new players dont give the game a chance and dont get the full rust experience. this game is a skill related game so people need to learn the recoil and drop of all the guns and this gives the game a very realistic feature. the ak spray is hard to understand and takes time to learn. if you play rust i highly recommend it and i recommend you have a friend .
overall i would rate this game a 9.5/10 and highly recommend you give it a go :)
yeah so like i got this on Christmas and let me tell yalls something. This is the littest shit ever dawg like you spawn naked and die trying to make a house and then just when you get your base down you get raided to people outside playing ram ranch and let me just say, a lot of these people got some great ass taste in music bluuuud! this game is worth it i recommend this game if your kid likes fortnite or some other trash game that revolves around fucking building, start by teaching them how to build like a man and not a pussy!
great game with many ways to play it but of you get butt hurt fast and hate toxic people this game is not for you, watch a youtube vid on it before buying
This Game is just amazing!! everything i have ever wanted in a game, If i would of known about it sooner i would of never played another. ( RUST ADDICT . COM ) LOL......
The ability to harvest salty tears is totally offset by the vile toxic nature of 90% of Rust's denizens, but find a good server with a regular good community and kiss your life goodbye.
10/10
Take 1 hour to connect to an official server ,Naked people run around and try to kill others with a rock when the other guy have flamethrower ,Helicopters will come and raze your base and kill you ,Random NPCs play 9 times better than normal players and known as noob-killers ,A horde of dogs will chase you and kill you and rape you. If you think this game is sick like me then buy it before it become expensive! Attention:requires good system.
THIS GAME WILL STEAL YOUR TIME, SOUL AND ANY SENCE  YOU HAD OF BIENG A DECENT HUMAN BIENG. AFTER JUST ONE WEEK OF PLAY YOU WILL HAVE DONE NOTHING WITH YOUR LIFE BUT MURDER INNOCENT 12 YEAR OLDS WHO ARE JUST TRYING TO GET A START OM THE HARSH HARSH ISLAND. Other than that though its a great game defenitly play it
First time playing rust - Get raided all right then new server
Me now playing rust - Get raided grind the shit again and raid the person that raided me and then switch servers
trust no one kill all nakeds and get use to be called the n word regardless of your race.
When I first started the game several years ago the scrap and blueprint system had not been implemented yet. That allowed small players like me and my few friends to be able to compete with the larger clans without the insane gind (there was still a grind though). The shift of the game has been more towards teamwork based gameplay which for some is nice and others, not so much. All of that being said, the game has brought me much enjoyment in the last couple of years so I will still give it a thumbs up. 7/10
I must say this is a game you can get almost anything out of. There is a very Toxic community attached to this game but if you can wade through all of that and be patient, you can find yourself somewhere to call home and enjoy yourself.
Fun game if you're into base building and raiding etc. I would recommend only buying this game if you have a lot of time to dedicate to it as you will find you often need to stay up overnight and for long hours playing.

Rust is more fun to play with a group of friends however due to the in game voice chat; you often meet people while playing. Just make sure you have a microphone so that you can communicate easily.

Be friendly, play for fun, and enjoy.

This game really is fun. I have over 5500hrs on this game and it's pretty much the only game I've been playing. Figuring out how to play doesn't take you that long. I would start out on a server with very low population to get the hang of everything or join a PVE only server. The devs are always updating this monthly and making things better. It has come a long way from when I first started playing it. It does have bugs from time to time but they update/fix it as soon as they can. Sometimes the next day. This game is toxic so if you can't handle someone talking trash to you or just being a complete butthole, then this game might not work for you. I'm always learning something new and always figuring new ways to design a base. Word of advice is if you get raided and lose all your stuff, don't give up. I wanted to give up on this game after 3 days of playing but you'll figure it out and it's extremely fun. I also recommend having some friends to play with, otherwise being Solo can be tricky on most servers.
best pc game i have played in a long while, but be aware people will do anything for a extra bit of loot. don't let some reviews push you away from this game cause they are most likely salty people who cant control themselves when at the end of the day  a game is a game it all comes to end sometime :)
Rust is by far my favorite game. The game itself is very dynamic and you are always improving your skill set when you are playing. Only real thing it lacks of is beginner servers. This game is very brutal and it takes sometime to get used to. By that time a lot of people already asked for a refund. I hope facepunch itself makes a few official beginner servers. Servers that you only can enter if you have less than a set amount of hours at the begin of the wipe. That and optimising the game for fps and glitches are the only recommendations for now. Amazing game
I can rate this game for a 8/10 as it’s an awesome game! But there are still things that need to be fixed. The worst of all is how hard it is for a new player to know how to play. If you want to play solo from the beginning of your rust experience you need to spend at least 500hours learning the game mechanics before you can do anything. But even with this fact it’s a fantastic game.
Pros
-good graphics
-Weapons fun to use
-good replayability
-decent amount of content (with more to come)
-lots of stuff to do 
- hundreds hours of content (or more)
-better if played with friends

Cons
-Toxic community (for the most part)
-No Singleplayer (unless you start up your own private server)
-Wait for a sale as you may or may not like this game(I got this during Early access)
-Losing all of your stuff while not playing (aka getting offline raided)
-going in a server solo is very difficult and can result in many unfair situations such as getting outnumbered, multiple scouts to find where you live, and having an increased No. of people usually means faster progression and better weapons than those with less people

Other Notes
-Graphically demanding 
-very grindy
-you can start your own server by going to the rust FAQ page (youtube has more info)
-Your experience (and hours of content) when you start playing will vary depending on whether your playing on vanilla or modded servers and or the people you play this game with will vary widely
-Don't recommend playing it alone unless you're on a solo only server
---


Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone who likes PVP games/survival (Survival against players). Most of these cons are caused by players, not the game itself. If you plan on playing the game without other players, you are going to have to start a private server. 
If you're gonna play online survival, just be prepared to lose all of your stuff while your not on this game or just play with friends.
Been playing this game for 3 weeks straight scince i bought it, only thing i can tell you is that community is toxic, i mean its rust right?, apart from that its just a fun game, sometimes you might cry, be mad or sometimes you will celebrate that you killed an AK guy, its rust, don't trust anyone. 
enjoyable game.!
[h1]rule number 1: dont trust anybody you dont already know.[/h1]

and because of this rule, every single person you meet is most likely going to KOS you. this is probably the reason that new players uninstall so early on. i have about 800 hours logged + Rust Legacy time. this game is fun if you know what the hell is going on
this is one of the best games i have played. i don't have the best pc. i have a budget pc it still runs with 70 fps on fast and in my opinion it still looks amazing to play the game. i highly recommend this to anyone who have a gaming pc
If you have anger problems or any stress related issues you are going to have issues with this game, the player Base is more toxic than a nuclear meltdown and being offline raided all the time will take you to a point of therapy. However, this game is fantastic and so addictive, as a survival game it's perfect, as a pvp game it's very good as a farming game you can't complain but as a social interaction experience it lacks, mainly.due to the toxic players but you can get past that eventually. Just be ready to die over and over again. Good luck and I highly recommend this game. See you on the beaches!
If you are a cry baby and need to win at everything don't get this game. It's survival based and you will get raided. Don't complain about being offline raided or betrayed by a teammate. This will happen hundreds of times over the span of maybe 500 hours.
More friends better everything, less friends better everything. People will kill you and steal your rock. Don't trust anyone or you'll get shot in the back. Lots of people are toxic. Basically the best game ever and most funniest community.
Rust is a very amazing game, the graphics are very nice but the community is very toxic. If your willing to lose hours or even
days of work then yes! Play this game, it's fun. But if you get mad easily I wouldn't recommend this. Overall it's really good
and fun, and if you find the right people you will definitely enjoy this game.
In total i almost have 500 hours on this game. I can say quite a lot about this game in every single detail but all i'm gonna say this is an overall great game and i love play it. Probably one of the things i love most is the feeling of accomplishment when you have a nice base and a crap ton of loot. But there is also that feeling of disappointment when you log on to see your base fully gone with all of your loot with it. Basically all i'm trying to say is this game has it's ups and downs but overall i give this game a 5/5 because this is a great game and a tip i can give you is stay on the friendly/community servers because that's where you'll see the best parts of the game in my opinion. Well anyway's see ya :).
Even though there is alot, alot of toxicity it is a good game to play with your mates, have some fun, and just have a good time while playing by yourself, or with some friends!
After 200+ hours playing this game, i've developed cannibalism, trust issues, anxiety, rage attacks, architecture knowledge, etc... Rust turns me into a bad human... TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME!
playing this game with friends is SOOOO much better than playing alone, however playing as a solo player changes the entire game. a must-play i would say. 9/10
be prepared to get angry , very angry.
and lose everything you worked for . 
and to get screamed at by toxic squeakers .
but find the odd friendly person .
who is only there to try and get his first gun then stab you in the back . 

all said its a great game and very fun with friends , i just wouldnt play solo 
10/10
•Pretended to be a Spanish housekeeper while trying to raid someone who was home.
•Somehow manage to get everyone to speak in a southern accent and call each other brother.
•Raid a boat with my southern brothers.
•Sell my friend to a trap for a sword that looked like a dildo.
•Chased halfway across the map into a cave and killed by the same trap.
•Get base bombed by a helicopter
•Instantly crash a salvaged helicopter and die.

10/10 great game!
The community can be really funny, really friendly (occasionally super toxic but that shouldn't be the case usually), and the game has beautiful graphics. Despite that the game is really tough and takes some learning and skill. I think it's way more fun with friends, which you can even find in public discord servers (clans are kinda cancer so try to roll with friends.) I bought it when it was cheaper and looking at the 35$ pricetag it can be a hard sell. Maybe wait for it to be on sale but it is a good game none the less.
Rust has come a long way since the beginning. With all the ups and downs of this game I always come back wanting more. Since legacy this game and the developers have amazed me with there creativity and involvement with the community. The developers are one of the most active teams in the gaming community which is also another reason this game has stayed afloat for so long.
You will turn down sex to play rust. Love it, can't stop. Get my teeth kicked in daily. Still, love it. I play 2x Vanilla mostly, but 5x No BP has been fun to mess around on. Highly recommend this game.
All the negative reviews on this game are posted by people that don't even have 100+ hours complaining about how toxic this  community is/ 1. welcome to the fucking internet people are gonna call you a fag 2. People complaining about spawn killing go to a different server then.(stupid) But if you put in the hours its a really fun game and I recommend it I have had a lot of fun with this game
Had this game from the very beginning. I loved it every step of the way. One of the most hilariously unforgiving games I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The fact that this game is still going strong after more then 6 years is amazing. Keep up the good work devs.
i laugh at all the people that complain about this game!....if you've nevered played it when it was a bata stage game then shut the FuckUP! this game evolved into a game of stradegy and finger skillz if you can't possibly win or die in the game trying then! DONT !BUY RUST ITS NOT FOR YOU !IF YOU CAN SUCK IT UP IN STOP COMPLAINING !ABOUT THE PPL OR ANY IN RUST JUST DONT INSTALL OR UNINSTAL! .....THERE'S ARE READY TO MANY CANCER AS PPL ON THE GAME DONT ADD YOUR! LIFE LONG BULLSHIT TO THE GAME .....BEEING SAID FROM ME I LOVE RUST IN HATE ALL WHO DONT LIKE IT......#RUSTISLIFE$ SINCERLY.....SirGreenThe1.......
its hard to give a review of this game since every single wipe is a new experience. you meet new players, make new enemies and maybe even get lucky every once in a while. its one of the most unpredictable games you can play right now and has loads of new experiences even after my 1k hours on this game. this is a game you can sit down and have a 12 hour session with your friends and not get bored once. but if you wanna take this game seriously youre not going to have any fun at all if you dont at least practice. its a brutal game, with brutal players.
This game will bring hours of fun, this game brings everything in all one game, pvp,building,driving and plenty of funny moments I defenitly recommend this game though you will come across a few toxic people.
Good game not going to lie, new players DO NOT PLAY SOLO and DO play on high pop servers, its the only way you will ever get good at the game, and dont be afraid to make new friends too while your at it.
Ok, so this game is actually pretty god damn good. I played with my friend and I don't need to complain about anything. Just that I can't change my female character...
i think this game is amazing. The amount of detail and stuff to do in this game is massive.With the amount of stuff you can do and all the details for only 35$ or 16$  on sale it is totally worth it. This game can be very rewarding and very dewarding (thats not a word) but i thinks thats part of the fun you experience in this game. I also think the graphics in this game or pretty amazing for this type of game. With most survival games the graphics are not as near as good as this game. It is pretty darn empressive for an indie studio. If i had to rate this game i would give it a 8.9/10. Very well done face punch.
it fucking sucks. you will break a keyboard but thats why i fucking love the game. its worth the court orders on noise complaints and violent assault on the people around you. but its fun, so touphen up and get pay the 30 dollars for te goddamn game. btw sub to pewdiepie
It is a grate game. Sometimes it gets really boring and old, but then I just leave and get on a new sever and I like it again. But over all a grate game you don’t really need a good pc for it witch it nice for people tight on money and the game get down really cheap.
Scale of 1-10 i'd say about an 8 overall

Graphics 8/10 Outstanding realistic graphics.
Community 4/10 more toxic than cancer
Gameplay/Mechanics 7/10 still kinda buggy but it'll do
Enforcement/Banning Hackers 8/10 They get them pretty quickly


TIP for beginners don't play officall play modded


So I've owned rust for maybe 3 years, played on and off, and for the most part enjoyed it.

Don't get me wrong rust in itself is a good game. The BP systems isn't the greatest and can take a while to get what you need, but it works. Harvesting, building a base, exploring and having the occasional firefight is also fun (talking about when i started 3 years ago)
The game looks good, runs well and have very frequent updates - 3 years on. 

The one reason why I would not recommend this game is due to the community. It is by far the worst community i've had the misfortune of experiencing - ALTHOUGH, I have met a handful of decent players.

When I started out 3 years ago it seemed quite different. Over time it has just gotten worse and worse, and it really makes the whole experience frustrating and unenjoyable.
You used to be able to mill about, collect reasources, build a base and get going without too much of an issue. The people you would come across would, more often than not, be friendly and leave you to your own devices. Of coure you would get the occasional hostile, but it generally wasn't that bad.

Unfortunately, now it is a much different story. 99/100 people will kill you on sight, even if it is within seconds of respawning... they will also often flame you out over the mic. I've heard every insult, racial slur and homophobic insult many times, every play session.
The trend at the moment is to greet you, tell you about how they are friendly, wait for you to let your guard down and then kill you. Many players will scream about being friendly and then kill you straight after. 
For the record I am one of the few friendly players in the game, but it gets very wearing after a while when everyone just wants to pretend to be friendly, kill you and then insult you over the mic.

Yes, I expect to get killed, raided etc in rust, but dont expect it every 2 minutes. It's not fun. I cannot imagine how new players will even begin to get to grips with rust - you simple do not have enough time from spawning to learn. I've seen quite a few get completely disheartened and quite on their first server.
Rust is not a "pure pvp csgo cod shooter", yet so many players seem to treat it like it is.
I like to play games to have fun, and rust was... once upon a time. Just not anymore. 

There is no penalty for running around and being an anti-social, toxic, idiot. This is a major flaw within a game like this. You can run around insulting, trolling and greifing as much as you like, along with forgetting how to interact with another humans in a normal way and nothing will ever happen. Rack up millions of kos kills, nothing happens.
Just because I play a game like rust doesn't mean I have lose all sense of decency when I interact with people. Yet 99% of players do and it is incredibly sad.

There is a reason the community on rust is shrinking. It needs to be addressed as rust is a good game...without 99% of the other players.

People who read this review can tell me to 'get gud' as much as the like, or whatever insults you have stored up your sleeves, but at the end of the day there comes a point where the toxicity becomes too much and it's just not fun... Welcome to Rust.

It's a shame I cannot recommend rust as it is up there with being one of my favourites. The community has just sucked out the last bit of fun for me.

Edit - Im not against the idea of rust (included raiding, fighting etc etc etc). Im solely talking about the players and how they interact with you. It's really killing the game.
The issue I have with the game, is by far, its community.

PROS:

-Intense survival experience, you are a mortal in a dangerous world

- Initially cold, hunger and thirst are real threats.

- The graphics can be very pretty, if you can run them.

- Sounds are nice, gun shots ring out and pierce the still air.

- Building is interesting and fun.

- exploration is interesting and the blueprint system is pretty fun.

CONS:

- The community tends to be absolute garbage *Expanded at the bottom*

- Servers tend to be immediatly taken over by massive constuctions, and sometimes clans immediatly dominate.

- Resources become scarce pretty damn quickly

- Animals run up sheer cliffs and can be quite glitchy

- No costomizability *this is very minor*

- KOS; COD style.

-Optimization, my decent rig constantly overheats if I don't put my fans into hyperdrive; manually.


NOW TO EXPLAIN: The community is simply cancer. If you are neaked and a geared trooper sees you, you can almost bet that he is going to shoot you for no reason. The excuse is; this is PVP, and that you ar a potential danger, or even "Just like in real life" 

     Well here is the issue, KOS is not very real life, BUT the game is silent, it is dead when you move around. The only thing to break the silence is gunshots, some screeming from what is usually a poor helpless naked that has just barely managed to get his 2.5k wood to start his shack. Even when he makes his shack, instead of negotiating forming an alliance, this player is eliminated, his base raided for little to no resources and as such he has to start all over and the raider gets the thrill of raiding an offline 2 by 2 shack. This is all due to a KOS mentality that is so far from survival mentality that it is in reality COD mentality. The game runs like this:

1) Spawn, get materials build a small base
2) get blueprints and start gettign ready to wreck some anus
3) establish dominance in your area
4) Once dominance is established with your little posse build a massive unraidable castle
5) dominate the area and consume all resources, killing anyone you see for the fun of it, because you are now bored. 
6) Make four excuses : "Git Gud" , "Become like us" , "Everyone is a threat, therefore I can KOS because I feel like it" , "Man salty nakeds" 

I once managed to get a small group going, immediatly a small but well armed clan emerged from their base and began hunting nakeds, just because. We had just managed to make a bow for one of us, when they emerged from the trees and just sprayed into us, killing all 5, and screaming through their mics that we suck and to "git Gud". This behaviour has slowly but surely been spreading throughout the entire community because it is the best way to play. Kill everyone, steal their resources, build yourself. It's also pointless. It makes the game a ghost town. Not but one year ago the servers were full of new players. Now the servers I usually play on barely peak over 1/2 the population, most of those being either clans or KOS' ers. 

     It is sad to see such a great game go to waste because of the community, the only break from this is RP servers and PVE servers. RP servers maintain that PVP aspect, but give it a nice twist where KOS is rerely an option as each side has quite a lot to loose and tensions get higher than ever, whereas with KOS its usually just a naked dropping dead every so often. Sometimes clans will clash and then everything looks great. But those occurences are rare. 

     The community needs to change if the game is going to ever survive, and in fact, thrive. I would suggest implementing a system like unturned has. You cannot hide weapons in your quickbar, either you have a tool to quick draw or a weapon, and then everyone can see how well armed you are, as well as add some strategic depth to the game. Also make nature more intense, make the PVE aspect even more challanging, its apparently post nuclear time, some strange shit ought to be walking around. It would add a nice threat to well geared players and well give nakeds a nicer start as they are suddenly not the primary target for shits and giggles. There also needs to be benefits to living a peaceful life, and benefits to living a violent one, and each needs its downsides. Right now violence is the only solution, pitifully so. Your chances of going out and finding a place to survive peacefully is nigh impossible. Especially when these massive bases make their rise. The only person rading such a base is another person with a similar base, and even then they will probably fail, and require a clan. 

     The game needs to change, and minor changes are needed. But as it stands I would not recommend the game. An amazing idea ruined by a terribly toxic community. Maybe ill come back to it next year. But for now, ill try and develope my own game, and see if I can fix these issues myself. -->

DISCLAIMER: This review is old, and as such does not reflect the game in its current state. I have been notified that apparently substantial changes have been made to the game. These changes might have fixed a lot of the issues that were inherent ot Rust, especially community based ones. But I myself am unable to confirm this as University and studies are taking up more and more of my time and as such i am unable to actually recheck any of my above statements.
Hi there. ive been playing rust for a few months now. 
recently ive been playing alot of solo. it gives me a greater sense of freedom. achievement. 
But, ive stopped playing now. I really love this game so much, but the way the game is now, it wants you to play every hour of the day.
especialy with the way cupboards and decay works. wanna take a day, or 2 break from the game? 
Nope.
wanna do that without your base getting turned over? Nope
but thats just rust. and i accept that.
solo rust is hard mode. i accept that.
but when your farming. and 3 guys, fully geared jump you, theres nothing you can do.
same sort goes for the rad towns.
you always. ALWAYS got a group of fucking roof campers at most of the radtowns. its bullshit.
but as a solo player ive gotten to the point where i just cant be bothered to play like this.
some of you will say. git gud. or go play minecraft.
well tbh i rather would go play minecraft at this point.
atleast its not the most stressful fucking game in the world. that near enough gives you a heart attack when you get suprised headshot.
I do NOT recommend getting Rust unless it's on sale perhaps.

Thanks for reading.
456 Hours of Rust at this time. Here comes my review on the game in it's current state: Rust is an amazing game, one of, if not the best survival games on Steam right now. But the thing that drives everyone, literally fucking everyone away from it, is it's community. The community in Rust is quite possible the most toxic and unfair group of people you will ever lay your eyes upon and you might truly think they all deserve to die, they might. On modded servers where you don't have to farm for an hour before you're able to even think of getting a base, still, it's nigh impossible to play without a group of 4 people or more because you will be demolished by every squeaker who gets a waterpipe regardless of skill.

Now on vanilla servers....where the gather rate is NORMAL....there comes to issue of a broken keyboard/monitor etc. you will be out alone for a VERY long time and the second you run into one person with better things than you, you have to start over ALL. OVER. AGAIN. It's very repetitive unless you have a group of your closest friends to play with you so you don't get destroyed. On the decent side, again, Rust is a very amazing game without the community, with great building systems, radtowns to find loot, and an amazing world to explore. But once more, stay away from this game until the community grows up and finally finishes 3rd grade, or you have a group of friends to enjoy the game with you.
Ok so played this game a ton and enjoyed past versions but the way it is now and at final release is terrible. The devs have purposfully made it so you cannot enjoy this game as  a new player and in my opinion taken away the essence of rust  and made it just a longer term battle royale game for the following reasons

1. Impossible as a solo player unless you play on a dead server or a solo only server (which just go play a farming sim in that case) you will most likely never see or touch a gun as the large groups of expierienced players will kill you every 2-3 steps and due to them nerfing the bow and spear (the only obtainable weps for you) it is highly unlikely you will kill any of them 

2. The game is so old and toxic that finding a solid group requires either slaving for 100+hours or geting extreemly lucky because most established groups kill on sight

3 Its not what made rust popular anymore in the since that no one talks over vaciinity mic. Which means people will not communicate with you besides the "haha get owned bitch" that occures after 4 of them shoot you to death as you try to eek together enough wood for a spear

4. Because no one uses the mic anymore the community aspect of the game has deteriorated. People used to help newbies and and least say a few things before the shots ring out.. the only thing you should expect to hear from other players is a gunshot sound followed by your screen going black

And to those trolls who are undoubtly going to say "mad cause your just bad" I played the full expierience was in a succesfull clan for ahwile and solo'd to  some degree of success for the last year or so. My point is not that the games to difficult its that its unfair and if you happen to be a FPS god you will have much more fun on other games. But if your thinking about buying this game without ever playing it b4 i strongly suggest you save your wallet. Ive got 800+hours in this game and wish i could return it now
So I know what you're thinking. Another negative game review for a game that is getting great press. How could this person be so ignorant of the majesty that is RUST? However, there is a specific reason I'm giving this game thumbs down. It will not go anywhere, it will take your 20 bucks unless you get it on sale, and say thank you for your money, and it will leave you feeling in some way molested after the experience of playing it for a few days.
Let me first start off by saying the game is fairly well put together as far as it’s landscape. The game map has very few clipping issues, or pit falls that will leave you stuck, and unable to retrieve your gear if you can get back to your gear before it disappears. The higher end guns and ammunitions work fairly well together, and the graphics are pretty good up to this point in the games development, so I can’t give it bad marks in these regards.
With that said I must commence with the game breaking negatives this game has to offer. After a few romps around different servers it has become clear that the game engine of this game is so full of security holes it could be used as a cheese grater. What could have been an awesome game has been reduced down to a slew of game cracking trolls that spend their time finding exploits to the game that allow them to fly, summon in anything they want, and know exactly were you are on the map at all times so that they can kill you and laugh. After reading up on the web about this wonderful game breaking experience, I was sad to see that the game engine used for the game is the cause of this slew of security problems. In short, the game designers would have to completely port this game over to another game engine just to fix the issue of hackers galore. Meaning they would have to start from scratch.
This game is in Alpha stage, and I understand that the company still can say that it’s in Alpha stage and it will still have problems. The issue is the game will stay in Alpha stage. The majority of people that want/wanted to play this game have come and gone, the player base has been destroyed. For a game that is to be a multi player game it will not have the multi player community after it’s all said and done.
Please, I beg of anyone thinking about playing this game to just say no. If you want to end up either dropping the game after a few days of play, or turning into a Troll, please stay clear of RUST.
In truth please stay clear of any game that says ALPHA in its description. At least with a BETA game you can say it’s past the majority of its development issues. I don’t care what age, race, or gender you are. It’s your responsibility as the player to put a stop to game companies wanting to get the juice out of a lemon before it’s ripe. And in the case of RUST I will chalk this game up as a learning experience.

OK, so I have to give the makers of this game major Brownie Points. they're actualy going to restart the game over on another game engine. Seriously this takes big man tenders to actualy accept the fact your product isn't going to work, and put forth the effort to fix it. Hats off to you guys working on this game, but still until the new release commes out, and it proves to be a lot more stable I'm going to keep this review up on your site. maybe some day I'll switch it over to a recommended.
This is a negative review ONLY because of the terrible rust community.

Rust is a great concept and I love it. It has many hours of fun buried with in it. Whether it is building a base or hunting animals, it's a fun game. But spawning in and dying from guns and crossbows for no reason is a terrible experience and this is what happens 90% of the time.

I've encountered this problem so many times over my 60 hours of playtime. Once I loaded into a server with 100 people on it and started to grind for 1 hour to build a base for my friends and somebody with a crossbow and shotgun and killed me, for doing NOTHING!

The rust community is by far one of the worst gaming communities I have ever played in.

This game is good if you have friends who are willing to tough it out and try and counter these scumbags. I've tried for over 60 hours and I can't seem to find any peaceful rust player who won't backstab me. It's unacceptable!

The rust community is beyond redemption, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
Pro: Can be fun, can be rewarding.

Con: The fun is constantly drained and destroyed by other players. Rust is extremely difficult to play if you cannot spend a significant part of each day online keeping your hard earned stuff safe. Offline raiding is a curse for the casual player, you just can't get anywhere if you only play a few hours per week. God forbid you are a solo; you spend 3 hours building the most minmal base to simply start an existance then come back 2 days later to find it destroyed/griefed or taken over.

If you are budgeting less than 3 hours PER DAY to play this game EVERY DAY, don't buy it. The gameplay promotes toxic player interaction; the weaker are continually preyed upon by the stronger, irrespective of the total lack of gain for the stronger player to grief the weaker. The fact that you just spent your entire weekly budget of playtime building yet another starter base, only to have it raided - again - by a bunch of high level chadbags that don't even need your pathetic equipment doesn't enter in to the decision making calculus of the average no-life basement dwelling socially inept tween/teen/pre-pubescant squeaker virgins that play this game.

You have been warned.
To be clear i didnt always hate this game and indeed it was fun but honestly now it is nothing like what was promised

Let me tell you all a story once upon a time there was a young handsome strong man who was in an apocolypse in which people spawn out of the ground naked women are gone and nearly all things have been forgoten (including circumsizion) the young man worked hard an built a shack he was shot by a man who took all his firewood 

The man respawned and was rocked to death while building a fire

then rocked again 

and again

finaly he found a friendly and then another and another and inbetween a douche who they killed then they found another 3 friendlies. They built the starving african village where they all lived in shacks no one had a weapon better than a bow or a metal hatchet they went to the radzone and found zombies to kill and food and some sacks. One day great warriors came and built a massive mountain of wood 50 steps from thier home. then every day three times a day they attacked the village and demanded tribute the africans hid in thier huts and left food and charcoal in the fire pit for the great warriors. The africans were sad and no one had any clothes except one man with a turban. One day the great metal sky god apeared and dropped his gifts to the world and the invaders left to recieve his gifts and blessings. The starving african village took the whole day to build and got a small long house and a great weapon that fired metal which they put a metal torch on and hid next to the metal doors of the longhouse in a sack. The africans felt strong they all had clothes and hatchets and bows and a single fire stick that could be held in one hand the next day they left no tribute for the great warriors and they attacked the long house and used explosives on the doors of metal the africans fought back and were utterly crushed and forced to leave the land of thier ancestors where they had starved to death so many times before due to lack of chicken and they were killed everywhere they went every time. THIS WAS THE BEST TIME EVER IN THE GAME 

I got the game during the dutch auction phase which proposed it as a primarily eve survival game with zombies and extreme threat of cold and hunger. Now there are no zombies because they were removed ( dispite this bieng promised earlier when it was originaly released) and there is nothing but pvp they only focus on that adding weapons while water still does nothing and there is not thirst. its really sad all people do is attack freshspawns and take thier stuff even though they only live in a shack and have 1 piece of chicken a stone hatchet and a pair of socks and a hand full of rocks. 

Next complaint sleeper system... Worst idea i have ever heard. Combat logging was the only way freshspawns and friendlys could keep gear and now they cant log off safely even outside of combat. One time i was given a full kit of m4s shotgun c4 and full kevlar the server was laggy and i disconected. Join back 2 mintues later i have been killed with a rock and have nothng.

Next complaint combat. It is entirely unfair people who have kevlar and m4s attack people and are impossible to kill for anyone without incredible weapons. it doesnt matter what you do shoot them 5 times with your pistol send an arrow literaly through thier skull so you see it going in and out both sides or unloading clips of ammo on them because they have medkits in thier hot bar so all they gotta do is press 5 when they get hit 6 times and they wont die dumbest idea to have instant healing kits. 

Radzones are now so hard to get into people either block them off or there are so many bears/ wolves that you need guns and armor and pills to get in and out so why even have them its not like the loot there is even that good 

the map itself is actualy pretty small and only has one road 

and how long has this been pre alpha its terrible 

THIS GAME HAD POTENTAIL IT WAS SOMETHING FUN ONCE BUT I WAS LIED TO AND IT IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT WAS PROMISED TO BE INSTEAD OF A GREAT CRAFTING AND BUILDING ZOMBIE FREE ROAM RPG EVE THIS IS A PVP WITH BEARS AND INSTA HEALS AND YOU LOG OFF AND WAKE UP DEAD WITH NOTHING NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOGGED OFF I HATE THIS GAME NOW AND I HAVE UNINSTALLED IT
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ITS TRASH
Good to play with team and on non-official servers.
Unfortunately, It's impossible to play on oficial servers:
1) no admins (looks like all facepunch is caring about is selling custom paintings). 
2) a lot of cheaters (they can see you behind walls and at night, shoot through walls, fly inside your base, autoaim to your head and kill you in 1 second from far distance).
3) all you can do is complain and press non-working "report cheat" button (i never saw a cheater was banned after such complains - they are still on server)
4) a lot of bugs, most of electic devices are bugged.
If you enjoy grinding and dying 24/7 while trying to do it this game is for you! The majority of the community is more toxic than them all including ARK, Conan Ect. I would not recommend  since the community is so toxic it melts my eyes.
Completely toxic, the trolls on this game never end poor pathetic people but truth. If you are a child with no soul you will enjoy this game, If you are a human being you will 100% hate it just because the whole community is toxic.
Rampant hackers, toxic people that keep killing nakeds despite them being end-game, and a time waster in general.

Only play this if you love the things above.
This game used to be absolutely fantastic, and still is, however I am giving this a "no" recommendation as it is often impossible to play due to the long wait-times and the fact that the requirements (spec-wise) to run the game have skyrocketed astronomically in the last 2 years despite almost no apparent change to in-game graphics and playability. Used to be able to load into a game in 30 seconds, but now it often takes almost 10-15 minutes, and even then it still often crashes after asset warmup.

Really disappointed that I have to leave a "no" review, but until they fix whatever the hell they've done to make the load-times so long, it's not worth buying at this time.
i love the game, don't get me wrong, but in it's current stat i just cannot with good conscious give this a positive review. a while back it seemed to run fine, but it has incredible long loading times (tried on several computers- doesn't matter which one i use) and has a quite a few lagspikes. once getting past that it's a great game that you can potentially since hundreds of hours into. just like i have, and will likely continue to do. 

what i like about it-
freedom- you can choose what you want to do, and go nearly anywhere. this is a huge plus in my book. 
the community- just like Eve online, it's brutal and no hand holding. the community may help, but at the next moment boom there goes your base- not something that's happened to me personally but i see it fairly often on community/modded servers i frequent. 


what i dislike about it- 
lagspikes 

long loading times.

what could be improved- 
the infrastructure has been improved recently but hasn't gone far enough to streamline the game so it is optimised across more devices. i understand the long loading times and lagspikes can potentially put off potential gamers who'd otherwise enjoy the content at hand. 

overall i give it a 9/10. but until the problems listed above are fixed, then it's a no i wouldn't reccomend it to my internet or RL pals.
The game would be fun if it wasn't over ran with people running door hacks and aim hacks.  If this company could get it's crap together and ban these skill-less idiots the game would be fun. I wouldn't recommend this game until they fix the hacking problem.
Playing solo is very difficult, and despite players and youtubers advocating for a more fun solo experience and not introducing that team system, they did. Even if it wasn't the solo experience that received this down vote, a lot of the community is embroiled in toxicity and hackers. Even with these issues I have had a fun time playing this game, but I generally have a hard time consistently enjoying this game until the previously stated issues come back to bite me in the ass.
Servers are crappy and takes ages to load in. And the game cannot even properly close without shitting itself. Alt F4 or Ctrl, Alt, Delete are your only options when doing so. And its boring, even for a survival game.
This game is a magnet for cringey zit faced teens that spam "git good" in the chat after killing you with absolutely no incentive to do so, over and over and over again. It takes DAYS to build a secure base, and literally 20 seconds for someone to destroy it for no reason... people will waste more resources destroying your base than they will get out of doing so... you can ask them in the middle of their attack, "what are you getting out of this, i don't have anything to give you when i die" and they only respond "it's rust, this is rust" this sums up every player, on every server. They should've called the game "Grief Simulator 2000" because trolling people is the only clear objective the game has to offer... This game is a complete shit fest with no lasting value or long-term playability. I paid $20 for this game and I feel they owe me $30 in return. Spend your money on another game, honestly. This is a sandbox game that only appeases to the lowest intelligence players in the gaming community, and is a sad reflection of modern day gaming.
I really wanted to like this game - but it appears the vast majority of the players are psychopaths.  You spawn, spend an entire 30 seconds trying to figure out what's going on and get killed by a random for no reason...rinse and repeat until you find a spot where a psycho isn't trying to kill you for no good reason...and then maybe - just maybe you might survive long enough to start building a base.
Worst game i have ever played in my entire life. Literally i spawned in then ten seconds later im being chased by a bear. I ran for 10 minutes and it still killed me. Another time i spawned in then a girl started chasing me until i strved to death. Every other of the 400 times i spawned in a guy that has a gun or bow just shoots you in the face on sight. I dont understand how you play the game when your not allowed. One time i survived long enough to make a base. Log on the next day everything is gone. It is such a poor excuse for a game. I want a refund. No matter what you do people will shoot you. No friendliness allowed because guess what imma kill you if you literally have nothing. Dont buy this piece of garbage.
16 hours in game, played maybe like 5 hours.
Wanna join a modded server? Wait 40 minutes till it loads. On potato settings. Then, when it starts, have a crash.
You wanna join a official server? No, sorry, all are full, you need to wait 30 minutes till 10 people leave, sir.

After the fucking bullshit you've experienced and the nerves you spent on rust, chillout and play GTA V with the best settings.

Holy fucking crap, that sucks.
Having started out playing games on the Atari like pong as a kid and then progressing from there I can say without a doubt that Rust is the single most TOXIC game ever- E-V-E-R- past or future. This game has the largest concentration of sweaty haven't showered or slept in days while playing virgin filled screaming profanity pubescent crap throwing male teens and to top it off its a grindfest that puts all the power in the hands of the jobless no girlfriend crowd so of course it attracts them like moths to a light. 

Finding those 1% of players who were older and joining together on a Trio server was pretty fun but it felt like you had to encase yourself in lead away from the outside world as much as possible, stepping inside of your base feels like stepping inside a saferoom after closing the door in Left 4 Dead. Just too grindy and too unfriendly for me to recommend although modded servers were more fun even when you really get to just combat you realize theres games that just do that better. If your a young male with a lot of free time on your hands and love to talk trash with your buddies and build this is your game for everybody else naw.
i buy this game and stuck in loading screen on many servers in 3.1hrs ....never play this game...i wanna refund my money back and steam say me ,,u exceeded play time,, where???i never play!!!!! i still freezeing in loading screen !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want to give this game high praise so badly, but the community that ruins it is what really makes me give it a bad review. I've been playing rust as of this review for about 2 months. My first two hours trying to learn the game where just repeated kill on sight interactions on the official servers so I moved to a PVE server. I still do enjoy playing on that particular server, but its mostly alone & trying out things I've not done before. 

But everytime I try to play on an actual PVP server, even ones with nice folks & good admins, there is always those guys who have to ruin it for others. I've done 4 full wipes now on pvp servers. Each & every time the biggest problem isnt the PVP, but the people who wait for you to go offline, then raid your base & lock you out of it. 

I have a job, & life to live outside of rust. I dont want to have to be online 24/7 to not wake up naked on a beach again. 

No amount of traps, base designs or doors seems to help this. I've yet to get past a level 2 workbench on any PVP server before being offlined off the server. Until this can be addressed for early game players just trying to play casually I cant give this game a good review. 

My only choice if I actually want to play at this point seems to be to join some large clan, which I dont care to do. So I'm going to play some other games for a while.
The game itself isn't that bad, but I really hate being killed, raided, etc. and it is definitely not for me.
Teamkillers and generally toxic people comprise basically the entirety of the server and me, being both a docile and sensitive person, doesn't really like that kind of scenario. Play at your own risk, but 2/10 game for me.
This game is really pricey and not fun. If you have friends, you like survival games and have patence (sorry for my spelling) get this game. Wait for a sale first too. Honestly I like hard games, but I dont like it when I spend 1 hour hitting things with rocks and trying to find my friends. You might be saying "well play with tpr and x5," those are the same to me. Don't get me started on the comunity. it does not matter who you are or what you are, people will just shoot you. overall this game is a huge piece of crap.
I really enjoyed this game at first.  However the longer I played it the more I started hating it and realized there's no point to it.  One cannot be online 24hrs every day and it seems that if you want to maintain where you were in the game then you cant log off.   

Let me tell you what will happen when you play.  You will spend night after night hunting for loot and improving your base.  Then one morning you will login and someone raided through your 30+ metal doors, seemingly ignored all your traps and you start again all over.   

I really enjoy the game but raiding is so over powered and so much in favor of people playing in large groups that Im deleting it now.  Ill never waste another minute on this.
I honestly have a lot of fun playing this game... with friends. Try playing solo and its the worst game made in history (not true but still).
If you are gonna play it get some friends first.
And its not worth the price
A video game about survival, undermining the competition, and skilled play.

Just kidding, it's one of those kinds of games where being a NEET with NEET friends is rewarded and doing literally anything else besides leaving the game running gets you gutted in your sleep and valuables stolen. You are basically exempt from play if you have any sort of life commitments like a family, job, or education. I accepted this and gave up on it years ago.

That being said, there isn't really a point to playing. The lows of the game are very low (losing everything) and any high points in playing (making someone else lose everything) are very brief. There's nothing else to really do because everything is a means to the raiding end. I waited more than a year for any kind of actual reason to play and there hasn't been one added to the game.

All in all, if you can afford this with your own money, you're not in the correct demographic to enjoy this game.  If you can afford this with your parents' money, you probably already play Fortnite anyway and this is just a hella slow Fortnite.

Yeah, I went there.
this game had potential but it was ruined by devs that couldnt be bothered to put the slightest bit of effort into it. look i dont have a super computer or anything but it can run pretty demanding games at medium to high graphics settings, it can even run rust but for some reason what it cant do is boot up the game properly at all. for a start there is a massive problem with the anti cheat which yes can be fixed easily but a £30 game shouldnt have issues like that at all. next thing is it takes up to 15 MINUETS to get into a server and thats if it doesnt crash before i can even start the loading screen. ALSO i swear this game is like an overly clingy gf. it hates me using any other programmes like discord and usually kicks me out of whatever call im in at the time AND if i even decide to tab out of the game EVERYTHING GOES BLACK and i have no other choice but to turn off my pc. just dont buy this game unless the lazy fuckers who run it fix it. dont even get it if its free its a waste of space.
(Please note this is just my opinion) Rust is an open world randomly generated survival game with interactable events and structures, and a lot of pvp. You build a base using twig and slowly upgrade through wood, stone, sheet metal, and finally armored. Other players can break into your base with explosives and take everything you have for themselves. Thats basically all the game is a survival game with constant pvp, fighting, and wars. But anyways in my 4+ years on steam this is the first review I am writing because I dont think theres any game more deserving of a bad review in my entire library so far. So why shouldnt you get this game? Well first Ill go over the few good there is in this game and give some credit where it is due. Believe me, I dont like to bash games like this and I feel sh*tty just writing this review but this is a review Ive debated on writing for a long time, and im finally doing it, anyways to the good.

PROS:

Graphics: 
This game is very beautiful and nice to look at, if you like to have good graphics in your games then in this specific regard this would be a big pro for you. Landscapes look beautiful with good textures and shaders with a nice bright color to it which makes the game feel alive.

Environment:
Like I just mentioned the game has a nice colorful and lively feel to it, and when you walk into the monuments (generated structures/areas) for the first time it is really cool to see the sort of trashed environment around you. The events are also awesome with supply drops, helicopters, cargo ships, etc. Theres even minicopters (with god awful controls) and some hot air balloons you can find and all of that just adds to the world and as said before makes it feel alive.

Building:
I have to admit the building system in this game is pretty good and there is some pretty good ideas you can come up with for traps and using the different types of structures in unique ways to make your base that much more harder to raid. The building generally feels smooth and super satisfying once you finally pull off building a good base and it can be genuinly 
pretty satisfying once you pull of a good raid on someone elses base.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The list of pros pretty much ends there for me.

CONS:

Grindy/Repetitve Trash:
If I could describe 95% of the gameplay of Rust in one word, it would be grind. If you dont like to grind, click off this review now and completely erase any thoughts of buying this game, because you will hate it. Me personally, I dont like to grind too much, especially alone, but it is so much more bearable if I have friends to play with and talk to, and I will get to that next. But the list is pretty much endless for what you have to grind for in this game: Breaking hundreds and hundreds of barrels for scrap to research guns and items so you can craft them, basic resources like food, wood, stone, metal, sulpher, animal fat, fuel, actually finding a place to build etc. And while you are trying to do all of that, if you are in a populated server, you are going to be killed, over and over and over again. You are going to have to repeat getting a good 50% of that just because of you dying to other people, whether they have bow, crossbows, pistols, rifles, it doesnt matter, you will die in this game so many f*cking times no matter how safe you think you are or no matter how good you think you are or how much you have gathered and grinded just for someone to come along and kill you and take for themselves right before you can make use of it. And I get it, at the games core, its meant to be that way, the game is meant to be brutal and you are somewhat signing up for it by playing the game. Obviously you dont know that at first until you actually experience the game unless you happened to watch gameplay before buying. But that is part of the reason I am writing this review, to be the one to warn you what you are signing up for by buying and playing this game. And after you die all those times and have to regather all of that stuff and finally get it to safety it just becomes more and more repetitive every time you do it.

Toxic Community:
This games community is pretty bad, its far from the worst community Ive seen in games but it is still quite bad. Partly because like I said everyone just kills you on sight and then you are forced to kill on sight yourself because you are afraid of being killed on sight. And its just an endless loop for everyones mindset. And even though it just makes the game more toxic than it already is, if you do decide to get this game you might as well kill on sight or just run away the second you see someone because if you dont they will just come back and f*ck you over in some way, shape, or form. I learned quickly to not trust anyone and it is because of those initial people that kill on sight that it forces everyone to do the same, ultimately making the game more toxic, I think you get my point. But that is far from it there is so many other ways this games community is toxic. I cant tell you how many times people will go on the beach with end game gear and just massacre every fresh spawn in sight just because they can and just because they want to f*ck other people over. I have killed fresh spawns before as well I think most have but I only do it when they get in my way when I am trying to loot not just to make everyone as miserable as possible. I also cant tell you how many times I have been killed with little to no gear on me and those types of people will you know act all friendly they will revive you give you some gear and right when you are free to go just shoot you in the back of the head just to pi$$ you off more and make you even more miserable. There are also dominant alpha clans in this game that can go up to dozens upon dozens of players and obviously no matter how hard you try you cant defend a raid against 20 people or defend yourself. But they will still pull sh*t like I just said before or they will just bm you into the ground because they know its unfair and they just want to- once again, pi$$ you off even more. It is the absolute worst feeling in the world when everything youve ever built/collected gets taken because of an unfair advantage and it is just shoved in your face. If you get killed your get trash talked, if you manage to kill someone you get trash talked because just because you killed them you are a "pu$$y" for whatever reason they may state. Whatever happens you experience bm, toxicity, and trash talking. And I mean it varies from person to person on how much bm bother you but to me maybe it happening occasionally would be kinda discouraging and a little rage inducing, but after it happens again and again for me anyways it really gets f*cking annoying and ruins the game in just another way.

Lack of Balancing/Clan Dominance:
I mentioned the clan a little in that past statement but honestly not even close to enough. This right here I would choose as Rust biggest con, the clan dominance in this game is absolutely absurd and it can not be understated in anyway whatsoever. As I mentioned there can be clans upwards of 20+ people and you cannot do anything against that unless you have 20+ people yourself, and that is not a common privilege that most people can get in this game. It doesnt matter how good of a base you think you have, how good of gear you think you have, if there are 20 people shooting rockets at your base, spoiler alert, you are going to f*cking die and your base is going to get torn to shreds. I cant count how many times in this game I have been raided and lost the battle because of the enemies having a giant clan or just simply having more people than me or me and my friends. And that is part of what caused me to write this review, just a few hours ago me and my 2 friends got raided. (See comments on this review for the rest, ran out of space)
I downloaded this game today havent been able to play it at all i think ive started it up twice it took like 20 mins and fraze both times so i restarted my computer and i havent even been in a server yet i have 40 mins on this game.
this game is absolute dog shit if you want to wait 30 minutes to get into a server every single time you play then your a retard. when you get into a game your faced with players who have a ton of experience and don't hesitate to kill you even if you have no loot. rust by far has the most toxic community and nobody new is welcome unless you make it to the top and have power over them. looking for a good game go somewhere else, don't waste your money.
This game takes way to much time to load, and sometimes doesn't even want to load. Once you get into the game you have to go through a series of constant freezing, and lagging for 30 minutes or more. When you try to use something that you haven't used when you got into the game ex: the microphone. The game has to freeze for that too. It's completely understandable as to why this game takes so long to load, and process everything. However, Ark has bigger maps, a lot more things to load in, and even more commands and items. So why does that game take way less time to load, and doesn't have players go through so much lag, and loading? 

Not only that, but when you try making a base lets say you mess up on a wall, or foundation placement, or something of that sort. You have to waste so much time and resources to break the thing you just placed down to correct your error, or just have to deal with it. 

And lastly, the game's logic. I was playing it a bit ago and was traveling around in the safe zone after grabbing a supply crate and was in the safe zone to check out what awesome loot I gained from it. I lagged not even half way through the safe zone, and ran into a wild dog. I had to run outside the safe zone till it no longer said "safe zone" on the bottom left hand corner of the screen, so I did. Once I saw that I wasn't in the safe zone anymore I had shot the wild creature with the loot I got, and was shot and killed by the turrets within the safe zone. If you're not allowed to defend yourself from being attacked, then why spawn in dangerous creatures in the safe zone? So I sucked it up and went back to the safe zone to get my loot back, and was shot and killed the safe zone turrets each time I came back to retrieve my stuff (3 times.)
The bad parts of Rust outhweigh the good to a ridiculous degree.

 The game's mechanics, progression system and player base all seek one thing- to waste your time. The game's performance is abysmal (and has been for the last two years I've played, will probably never be improved in any significant way), the admins are basically non-existent. Hacking is rampant in Rust and you have no recourse (the report system is probably there as a placebo since so far it has seemingly done nothing.) Expect to be killed constantly by Russian clan kiddie squeakers who have monopolized half the map. 

Raiding can be extremely fun, especially when you chance upon a big fat stash of exotic loot you haven't seen before, but prepare to waste dozens of hours of your life before you ever get to that point (this is from the perspective of someone who has played with a premade, if you are solo you will have a SIGNIFICANTLY worse time, which is really saying something). Rust is a deeply flawed game, the devs don't give a flying shit, and you are better off not wasting your time or money on it.
20 minute loading times, toxic community, unintuitive menus, and consistent crashes.
Until these issues have been resolved with a price drop, there's just way better games for the price.
I'd stay away ): 

And verifying game files, clearing cache, and restarts didn't help. 
Just playable on 1060/15 8400 fast settings smhmh.

NoT fUn
Reasonably fun game when you actually get to play it, but you have to dedicate at least an hour to loading a server if your computer isn't less than 2 years old (and then it crashes)
I've played this game far FAR too much in the past few weeks and I've come to realize something about it.

This game is a extreme dichotomy of "FUN" and "HATE"

Fun things:
Building up a base
Making defenses
Roaming combat
Looting
Raiding

Hate things:
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH EVERY FUCKING OTHER PLAYER IN THIS GAME

I'm not the kind of guy who gets mad about losing a few guns I made in combat. When I roam I only bring what I expect I could lose. But the community is SO TOXIC! It's like the community somehow crossbred extreme mic spamming REETERS with basement dwelling neckbeards and made them all 12 years old. THEY AREN'T EVEN HUMAN ANYMORE! Sometimes I swear if I heard one of these cancers coming up to me in game screeching and then I heard a gunshot then silence from their microphone, I would laugh.

Then there's the complete opposite. I was raiding a small wooden door base at some point when there weren't many people on and someone came up to me. It was dark so I dove out of the light from the incendiary shotgun rounds, but he killed me. He told me I could come back and get my stuff in chat, which surprised me. He said he was bored, so he took me to his base, gave me a pistol and said "Let's go raiding." We ran around the map for a few hours and broke into a couple of places before he said he was tired and I could have everything on him since he could rebuild the stuff easily. You don't get this kind of thing in other games. It's pretty awesome.

However, I realized something a little while later, this game was super addicting, and I was playing so long I realized I wasn't having fun. I was getting obsessed over defense and getting the higher tier gear. I was moving to the most remote location I could find and setting up a costly base that I would have to maintain daily and it would still crumble to anyone with enough rockets. I realized that I had been wasting my time and not having those fun and random interactions, I was desperately trying to create something that could be so easily lost and the only thing that spurred me on was the idea of all the loot I would be able to get. But what would happen when I got there? Once I had the best armor, guns, and rockets all I would do is become like one of those roaming bands of assholes that go around killing anyone they see because there's nothing left to gain besides more of what you already have. I decided to uninstall after I'd stayed up far too late just mining nodes and smelting metal for a base and realized I was bored.

Of course before I did that I despawned everything in my base so no assholes would get them ;)

TLDR: The game has great aspects to it, it's very addictive, the community is toxic as hell, it drives you to try to gain more and more but once you have it there ain't SHIT to do.
16 GB Ram, GTX 1060 6GB, Core i7 7700 and still my FPS is dropping from 60 to 20-30 everytime (Just in this game and i haven't any problems in the other games) full of toxic players and annoying bugs. it doesn't worth to buy
What a fun and interesting game! Spend hours grinding to get enough materials for a simple stone shack, only to have it blown apart while you're asleep! Get repeatedly spawnkilled as a newbie by a troll with endgame gear while they spam racial slurs in chat! Build whatever you want, but keep in mind it'll be gone after the weekly server wipe, rendering all your work pointless! It's just like Minecraft, only shittier and with more genitals! Boasting a PvP system even more unbalanced than Halo 5's Warzone REQs and a community more toxic than PUBG pre-game lobbies and LoL chat combined, Rust proves to be a spectacular waste of time and money.
The only time when I would have considered this game enjoyable was when I spent time building bases on a friendly server and exploring the map. Most of the community are toxic people who just kill you upon spawning in the world, with no chance given for you to build a proper base before getting ass f*cked by a screaming kid on voice chat.
NOT FOR ME...

This game would typically be right for me but the fact that you seriously struggle to make any progress in servers without the threat of constantly being killed makes the game poor. I appreciate there are quieter servers you can play but come on really...

# If you don't grinding resources whilst also being constantly killed then this game is for you.
# Graphics are great.
# Crafting system seems good too.
# Rude community.

Good concept overall and I'm sure there are lots of people who enjoy the game.
Do not buy this game.

I bought this game because I thought it was cool and also because one of my friends were playing it but it's an absolute chaos.

First off, most people I see on any server are not nice whatsoever. Everytime I join a server, there would have to be a lot of people who would kill me for no reason, either with guns, a rock or with any weapon/tool.

Second off, this game takes a whole hour or 30 minutes to load; I've played games that had long loading times but I never played a game that took THAT long to join a server. People say if you want the loading time to be shorter you will need to have a SSD, so don't play this game if you installed it on a HDD.

And lastly, the game is very unoptimized, it takes up most of my memory, my cpu and my gpu, I can play the game fine, but sometimes the game stutters and freezes randomly which gets annoying especially to low-end PC users. (I'm a med-end PC user)

If you're fine with all of this, you can buy the game, but I warned you.
I can't tell you how good or bad this game is because I can't play it. I have a beefy pc, with intel i5 and nvidia geforce gtx 1060 (which should run the game) but it takes and hour to load, then runs awfully, to the point of where you can't play it.
Steam says I have 94 minutes played and about 6 of those was actually playing the game at about 1 frame per 3 years.
I bought this game a looooong time ago, when it was just starting. It was pretty fun. You could explore, build weird stuff, people you met were friendly and would help you. The devs were clearly inspired by STALKER and STALKER was awesome. I grew nostalgic recently so I reinstalled it to check out the progress, which brings me to two reasons why you should never buy this game:

1)absolute lack of any goal while the sandbox elements are heavily restricted: When I played the game at the beginning, there was not a whole lot to do in the world, but it was excusable because of early access. Now, YEARS LATER, there is still nothing to do! You just gather resources, visit the same places where boxes spawn and fight over them. Rinse and repeat. There is nothing to do, nothing that would push you to cooperate with anyone, no challange to overcome once you craft some stuff, literally nothing. You just shoot everyone you see, and since the mechanics are pretty clunky compared to games where shooting each other was the whole point, you are left with a subpar shooter with some building elements, which are also unrewarding because you can't just set out to build anything ambitious unless you want to log in every hour to collect resources so that your base doesn't decay. That's just busywork and it is boring as hell. No aspect of the gameplay is implemented in a fun way, even though they sound like they should be.

2)The community: I play LoL so I know what toxic means, but the level of griefing and toxicity in Rust is staggering. To be fair, I can't blame the players since, as I wrote, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO! So within a few hours after a wipe, there will be a ton of people who already have assault rifles and use them without warning on anyone they see, even if you spawned 5 minutes ago and have only stone tools an 200 wood. So you will die. A lot. For no reason and with no gain to the person who killed you, which is the very definition of griefing, and it happens on every server.

I really want to like this game. I have spent a lot of time in it and can handle my own in a fight, but every time i start anew, the best part of any game imo, it's like pulling teeth. You build the same shack, collect the same materials, die to the same griefers, kill some people, and then... That's it. Nothing else. It's the Battle Royale version of a crafting game.

TLDR: lack of content and true sandboxy freedom with the single worst community in any game I've played. Skip it.
This game is full of toxic people and i got banned without any reason. I use to play this game a lot but if you randomly get banned on official servers then I'm done.

it was good back in Early 2017, all these updates really changed the game, and the whole look at it, it is no where near as good as it used to be, honestly i would rather play ark, game used to be 20$ now it is 35$, gameplay is ok, really toxic people, lol it is fun, you can do lots of incredable things, raid people, even make them cry from rage, destroy peoples progress, it was a fun time, see rust was mainly about an open land, more like a waste land, post-apocalyptic like, and now we have working electricity and helicopters and all that other mess, i mean most of it just doesn't make sense to me, their is just no natural aspect to the game anymore, like i said it was better in early 2017, buy it for yourself and find out if you like it, you may have your self a better opinion.
Literally spent almost an entire hour crashing and loading trying to get into games. Almost a whole. Fucking. Hour. Mostly of nothing but loading screens. Such a waste of time
This game is actually trash now they added to much to try and sell out and get more players but this is the most toxic game on steam and will make you break so much shit because no matter how good you are there are always zergs who will kill you instantly. If you just recently bought this game return it as soon as you can because it is not worth the 35$ or the massive anger issues you will get from playing this game
Pros-Fun to build bases
Cons- Awful community. Extremely toxic and full of bad sports
-Takes way too long to gather enough loot as a solo player to establish a meaningful base
-horrible lag to matter what settings you use ( I have an 8700k and 1070 so i know its not my pc)
-the game has taken me over 30 minutes to load each time with the record being 56 minutes
This game all together was my single biggest waste of money ever. Don't buy this game unless you like toxic communities and have 10 other toxic friends that can play with you.
What a pathetic game. It has many features-true, but the community is highly toxic. People with friends can easily setup a base and gather resources faster but players who play alone will face a very difficult time. The game does not even even have a proper tutorial. There is no server restriction i.e a highly armored person with machine gun can easily come infront of a new player with nothing but just a stone and kill him for fun. Inshort this game is a total waste of time if you dont have many friends who can play together with you at the same time. If you are a solo player you will probably be frustrated and regret buying it just like me. So its better to stay away from such a bad game
Do not buy this game unless you love being trolled and killed constantly.Then again if you prefer to constantly start from nothing then whelp points to you, I assume you are Autistic.
What a waste of $50. Game does not even run properly, takes 30 mins to load into a server and when the game finally decides to load in you spend most of the game running from or getting killed from people with the best armor and guns all while being stuck on 10 fps.
The community killed this game. This game is dogshit due to geared players literally following nakeds just to kill them. Gameplay is 1/10, nearly fucking impossible to play as a solo.
Coming from DayZ, at first, I thought Rust was very cool. It was much more laid back, you could interact with the world in so many ways, build bases, and the mechanics were so much less clunky. Furthermore, I never noticed any game glitches. Can't say the same for DayZ.

While I did have a lot of fun on Rust by chasing people down the coast on crowded servers, gathering supplies, building bases, and interacting with the WONDERFUL community, it got tiresome very quickly.

Getting killed with 10,000 stone is not fun, and while you may say it's just part of the game, when it happens over and over you start to get pretty frustrated. Building a base, filling it up, and finally having it all set up nicely is fun....

Until someone who low-life's the game with 3000 hrs on record puts an auto turret outside your house, pulls out a rocket launcher, plows through ten of your "metal" doors like nothing, guns you down, and steals all of your loot, destroying all of your progress in a matter of seconds.

Or when you find out how many supplies and steps there are to making one satchel charge.

Or when you constantly encounter groups of Chinese hackers.

Rinse and repeat, and the game gets tiresome and annoying VERY quickly. Don't waste your money.
*Gets game banned for literally no reason because of a ban wave* "Hmmm. Shouldn't be a problem" *E-mail support in which I'm essentially told to go fuck myself*


I hope your company bankrupts.
most toxic game and community i've ever seen, you get killed for no reason at ALL time, i just spaned, i don'T even have clothes, i get killed, it's not like any other survival game where you can find fully loaded weapons and defend yourself, it takes a lot of time and luck to have gear, and you jsut get killed over and over again for no reasons, even if you have nothing, toxic community, don't play this game
just let this fuckin game free. im already buy this fuckin game 
this fuckin game not recommend to buy just just recommend for free 
the player always kill me, im chat him but he still kill me there are not much frendly player 

8GB of RAM is not nearly enough to run this unoptimized shit pile of a game.

Crashes left and right and loads for 15 minutes unless you have like 16 or 32 GB of ram
Let me start out the review with saying that I love Rust, but some circumstances that happened to me recently makes me think that Facepunch just don't care about the players. My Steam account got hacked and when I finally got back onto it, it said that I was perma-banned on Rust. I figured that I should email Facepunch and tell them what had happened. The email that I got back from them really made me mad. It said, and i quote: "Account security is your responsibility". I don't know why they think that I have control over when I get hacked or not, but all I know is I still can't play this wonderful game.
Trash game. How the hell does this cost 30 euros. Very sad! 17.2 hours in this game 14 hours of those 17 were in loading screens. Wish this game had a better future. Just sad!
Don't be fooled by my 13 hour game time. I have only been actually in game for only about 3 hours most of which consist of me getting murdered on sight. I am keen to find out what late game is like however in a decent server it requires you to join a queue of about 90 people allowing you to endulge in 2 hours of free time that you have until you get in game. I have really enjoyed catching up with missed work and being with my family during this time. I would recommend if you have too much time spent on the computer and want a forced break. 10 My family have finally accepted me back out of 10.
If you like working hours, sometimes even days, to gain materials, build a base and get lots of stuff, only for it to be taken by two 14 year old Russian kids, then this is the game for you.

This game also includes:

Severe issues with hackers (aimbotting, ESPing and no-recoil definitely isn't uncommon)
Being fucked with by end-game players while you have nothing but a rock
Hackers
Incredibly repetitive gameplay with not much to do besides slap trees and rocks
Hackers
Mic-spammers
Hackers
Offline raiding
Hackers
A really, really shitty anti-cheat.
This game is extremely difficult to have fun playing if you are a solo player. Starting out you will constantly die which only serves to demotivate you. Furthermore, it's extremely easy for any group of players to come and steal anything you have even if it takes you hours to build. The game isn't the worst but I definitely wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wants to actually accomplish something.
A  Really hard game to get into by yourself without a gang of mates. I joined a NooB friendly server, spent hours foraging and crafting to be killed by the first human player I saw - losing all my stuff.  There is no safe zone, and no reasoning with  other players. They will club you to death for a bottle of water, sending you back to the beach, naked. 

No way to progress, I quickly got bored of this. 6 hours of hard restarts - not much fun - plus INSANE loading times. 25 minutes+ to load a world.
Not fun. You can play many hours/days and collect stuff, learnings skills etc. Just for some1 to kill you at ambush and take all your stuff, destroying your base.Then back to square one, all those hours wasted. Eh.... Could be fun I guess but no1 is trustworthy and killing hungry.
It can be fun but the community at large is the textbook definition of the word toxic so beware. The worst part being that is intended by design of the game itself. So while I play it, no I wouldn't generally recommend it to a normal, well-adjusted human being who isn't already cynical and numb from already having endured it's countless frustrations and anti-social interaction already.

I know all of that sounds bitter, but as I said, I do still play it sometimes, and so yeah if you're looking for a challenging survival simulation game and are willing to sacrifice anything you have going on in your life now to throw 12 hours a day grinding if you get sucked into it, yeah I guess you should definitely give it a try. It's one of the pioneers of the genre, and possibly still the best one.
[H1][U][I][B]THIS VIDEO GAME HAS NO OFFLINE PLAY. THIS VIDEO GAME HAS NO SINGLE PLAYER MODE. DO NOT PURCHASE THE GAME IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A HIGH-END, DELUXE GAMING COMPUTER WITH AN INTERNET CONNECTION EXCEEDING ONE HUNDRED MEGABYTES..[/B][/I][/U][/H1]

The amount of time you see logged for this game, one hundred seventeen minutes as of writing, is not from playing the game. Imagine waiting so long for a game to load that you cannot refund it. "Rust" is that game. I have a one hundred megabyte Internet connection through Ma Bell, and it still can't download it.

Like "Sim City V" (be thankful if you've never heard of the 2013 AD incarnation of that series), this game has a compulsory Always-Online system and requires connections to servers. The problem is that the servers are so large, detailed, and expansive that they take well over a hour to even retrieve. The Server I chose, which was one of many on a list, had over five thousand chunks to download. That took well over a hour.

Then, you have to load the Huge Monuments, then the Medium Monuments, then the Tiny Monuments, then the Caves, then the thing has to be "pre-fabricated"... it was agonizing.

I hate to rate this game down, as I haven't even gotten to play it, but the always-online mandate and lack of both single player and local multiplayer game play make it untouchable. I have no choice but to write this, because I am unable to get a refund this close to two hours.
- Toxicity is greater than any game I've ever played.
- Unoptimized. 2560x1080 takes up 8GB video memory and 10+GB RAM... seriously? 
- No character customization whatsoever. Your gender is picked at random. You may scream all you want, developers won't listen. It's intentional. Sure I won't mind spawning as a black guy, but randomizing your gender... I mean, whoever is developing this probably agrees that having a man's voice coming from a black/asian woman's body is ugly... Your algorithm must be pretty HORRIBLE in randomizing people's in-game character based on Steam-ID... 
- Requires large time sinking for it to be rewarding. You also need a BIG group of ACTIVE friends.
- Needs re-balancing.
- Resource gathering and crafting needs a huge overhaul. Building just a small base requires at least a good 1h of gathering resources and hope that RNG is on your side that you won't get killed to start all over again...

Final Verdict: 4/10
this is so frustrating, i bought this game and i havent been able to play it because of a "Error Code:23" no solution works and i got scammed by Facepunch
I really liked it, but could not play it. Whenever I tried to enter a server it would freeze and say rust.exe has stopped responding. I tried every graphics setting,  and got it to work at one point, but it started crashing again. I had to ask for a refund because the game is just not playable
A solid enough survival game, even taking into account how poorly it runs and the atrocious load times.

The community, however, is essentially a microcosm of everything wrong with online gaming.  Chinese hackers?  Check.  Unsupervised 11 year olds?  Check.  Idiots spamming unfunny memes?  Check.  Slurs a-plenty?  Check.

As ever, I find myself wondering why I thought I'd enjoy playing a multiplayer game.
Do you like trolls?  Do you like playing a game where everyone lurks on fresh spawns and, unless you are already well established or have half a dozen friends, you can't survive more than 10 mins on a server without dying 10 times?  Then this is the game for you.  It may have been a good game at one point, but it has gone to total crap now.  I can't say anything negative about the game, itself.  It is the community that is more toxic than a YouTube comment section.
Only thing this game needs is Tutorial and PRIVATE SERVER.

People playing solo or new players will hate this game.

with friends its really good game
My friend and I have been playing this game for hours. What i can say about the game is that the developers don't care about their players, official servers are full of hackers and this is not the worst, most of the game consist of grind, grind and more grind. Finally, when you have collected some decent amount of resources someone (probably clan player)will find you and will torture you till you stop playing in the server. I totally don't recommend the game as it becomes chore which takes all of your time and in the end someone will stole all of the progress made by you.
This is the most annoying survival game I've ever played. It manages to pull off being too hard and too easy at the same time. It's your first time playing and you need to make an ax? Don't worry you don't have to figure it out because a shitload of the crafting stuff is straight given to you, but need to find cloth, good-luck figuring out that cloth comes from hunting animals(wtf?). I was harvesting wood when a random fucking deer started attacking me for no reason and killed me. The first time I spawned it took me 30 minutes to find stone but for some reason metal ore was fucking everywhere. The community is largely trash too, a lot of shit talking and killing defenseless players to make their e-peen feel huge. The map conveniently marks shops and other things that you otherwise wouldn't know are there, but for some reason can't mark the location of your dead body so you can go recover the last hour of work you lost because a fucking black bear kills you without warning (sound). You know, black bears, the timid and shy bears that avoid humans at all cost? Ya, it doesn't make sense to me either. If you have half a brain, don't turn it into mush playing this game, unless your a masochist.
No dont buy it you might get vac banned for someone hacking your account and family sharing.  As well get ignored by staff and them not helping you at all to get it removed.  So yea thanks FacePunch for basically fucking me in the ass.
I like rust its a good game but many problems occur whilst playing the game.

if the developers read these here are a few things to add.
1. an optimization option , the fps is really low for me and i have a great PC it can run gta 5 77 fps max settings and i cant even play this at a constant 20fps lowest settings.
2.make a report option for voice communictaion , there is so much racism in this game its unbelievable.
3. make the default nudity setting pixelated cuz it aint so nice to see stuff at first.
4. make the loading times into a server alot faster it takes years to load into a server and when u get on its all laggy 
5. make a maximum players in a team, clans over run the game 
6.make fps easy to get , its so laggy
6. fix lag
7. fix lag
8. make more options for graphics. 
I WOULDNT RECOMMEND RUST YET, I HOPE THESE THINGS GET FIXED 
ITS VERY FUN WHEN IT DOESNT LAG, LIKE REALLY FUN
My Rust adventure:
1. Bought expensive gaming laptop, every game works full HD with fps over 60 sometimes even 300.
2. Bought rust
3. every server takes long to load. totally takes ages on both my fast PC and laptop with 160mb download internet
4. 30 min before i selected potato graphics in configuration
5. after a total of 60min it FINALLY loaded someones server
6. my gaming alienware laptop burns regardless lowest graphic settings
7. my fingertips burn
8. all stone and wood taken, every land taken
9. my fingers get so irritated after 20min of 'gameplay' that to avoid skin cancer and further pain i quit the game
10. i bought expensive MSI apache pro laptop (one of their top tier laptops)
11. repeat from step 3

also RUST is gamedev meme when talking about Unity optimization

if i had that money back i could actually buy something i would play at least 20h

BTW, LETS NOT FORGET, TO PLAY SINGLEPLAYER YOU MUST DOWNLOAD AND HOST YOUR OWN SERVER THAT LITERALLY BOILS YOUR PC EVEN MORE

PS, i said joinng a server takes 60min, regardless the server you join and your PC configuration/net speed it will take somewhere between 10-60 minutes (but most likely over 20min)
Game fuckin sucks its hella fun but its hella long load time and constant crashing ruins it completely. Really waiting 10 mins for "asset warmup" just so the game can crash lmao.
This game is not recommended. At all. If you have toxicity, than this game is not for you. It is extremely difficult to get settled to this kind of game especially when you get a bad spawn or when you get started and get killed.
Game is actually horrendous, constantly getting roll backs which lead to hours/days being wasted for no progression in the game.
i strongly advise anyone before purchasing the game to look into it a bit further as the game is really bad, surprised it actually is not in testing still, there are constantly hackers on every single server you go onto, after reports it takes about 1 hour for the hackers to get banned even after getting banned they will come back on another account as they just buy steam accounts for under $2, the community is toxic/cancerous, if you get killed/kill someone you get told to 'kill yourself irl', out of having 380 hours in the game i have only ever had a half decent experience approx 3 times which would be about 10 hours of gameplay.
The game currently for me is deleted and will not be installed ever again even if it miraculously becomes semi decent.!!
I normally don't write negative reviews if I don't like a game, simply from not liking it, I just uninstall and don't play. However, I've spent 30 minutes trying to get this garbage game to run, and I haven't spent a single minute actually playing it. It's so horribly optimized that it crashes or stops responding during the initial load screen. I sat in the load screen 15 minutes, only to have it crash. Multiple tries. It's not worth trying further... doubt it's that good anyway. Playing on a i7 6700k, 9gb RAM and 1080 gtx with a Evo SSD. No reason for such performance issues.
I like the game play but if you live on the east coast of the usa don't get it you won't be able to find a server with less than 100 ping and for than 3 FPS
this game is a complete waste of my money. I tried playing and getting in a game waiting for everything to load wasted all my time i got maybe 30 minutes of playtime. I wish i can return this game but i waited to get in a game for too long i got 12 hours on it only 1 hour was spent playing the game. Its not even that good either most of the community is so toxic i found a chainsaw and tried to give it to someone but they just shot me. the game also is bad because if you are solo with a ok to bad pc its very hard to play this game you will probably only get 12 fps and everyone will kill you
help me i wasted 40 bucks on this game and now its 50 percent off
Nothing but nonstop of murder. Played for 12 hours and every time I got any basic material someone with swords or guns would immediately murder me. This is the most toxic game i've ever played
I don't know why people don't talk about how long it takes the game to load like 15 to 30 mins.  Then when you're lucky enough to get into the game you have no weapons and 10 minutes later you'll get killed by anyone with a bow or high powered gun Ak fire from afar.  Good luck btw I didn't mention you lose whatever you have collected.

Obviously not a problem if you have a base somewhere to restock... ooops forgot to mention only if you manage to build one and that'll probably be if you can afford one and not killed and lose everything again...

One word for this game it sucks.  There's no time for you to have a chance in this game unless you play for 4 hours straight  and hope to god you don't get killed.
Community of this game is the toxiciest I've ever seen in my life. Racists, sexists, just salty kids... stay away from this game. Or build up your own server and play there.

Also, the optimization in this game sucks a ton.
Have fun loading for 45 minutes just to realize this is the most poorly optimized game in the world, as well as filled with toxic people. To Facepunch, you should all just quit your jobs because you're obviously not working when you're just jacking each other off in the office all day.
got the game. i keep dying because people drill me when i spawn. for some reason im banned from some servers i havent joined. when it goes dark i cant see a thing so i die of starvation and then i spawn the other side of the map, which takes like 5 hours to walk across on feet. just a bad start tbh
The game is unoptimized and the develepers are lazy. No survival game should demand 16 gigabytes of RAM with these poor graphics. My specs are:
I7-4771
RX-570 8GB
8GB RAM running in dual channel at 1600MHz
1TB hard drive
250GB SSD

I played many other games that looked way better than this and didn't demand that much.

In conclusion stay far away from this if you have 8GB RAM you will just waste your money.
I thought you could make your own character i was wrong waiting for refund  this game might be fun but being a random character i did not make is just not a great start for me i have like 18 mins in the game just trying to make a new character found out that im unable to make my own character wish they put this info on the game where everyone can see know im just stuck her waiting for refund
When I loaded into the server after waiting for a while, I still couldn't play when it said press any key to get up and it wouldn't let me, but I can run games like the division 1 on medium to high graphics, so its not my computer. I'm still currently waiting for my refund.
If I'm not mistaken, Rust is ranked for having the most [b]toxic[/b] player base community; truly it is. I often got instantly killed and looted as a new joiner. That said being even worse, sometimes I still got killed for no reason (inventory is empty as well, nothing to loot). And this game takes me ~45 minutes to barely load into a server. I can tell it is unlikely neither my PC's incapability nor poor internet connection. As compared to popular big game like Ark: Survival Evolved, it would only takes me ~15 minutes to load into a server (with plenty of mods loaded).

The graphics are great, it could even better if your PC is capable of it. Since it is a survival game, definitely fun to play with your own friends [strike](you must, as stated above you'd be loser as a solo)[/strike]. I see the great potential within the game itself regarding to the positive reviews and ranked for top 10 game on Steam Chart. However, the toxicity within the community itself keeps me away from playing this game ever again.

[i]Luckily, I got to purchase this game at a super cheap price, it's no big deal to me. Hope someday I will come back to this game again [strike](with friends)[/strike]. By that time I may revise my comment.[/i]
horrible worst game ever created not playing ever again!!! bought for $34.99 downloaded and played quit within a minute cant even play as any character to choose to play as. female gamer playing male character total bs!!.. what ever happened to power to the players choice customization and freedom like any other open world mmorpg. feel like female rights violated and developers wonder why games get modded and hacked now a days. cause of poor of excuse of developers don't know what there doing from first start...
Time Waster 3000 should the the name of this game. Biggest piece of shit I have ever played, hope to god garry and rust dev get hit by traffic or worse
This is a game for losers who have nothing better to do with their time than kill other people for fun.  It's filled with pubescent boys and middle-aged dudes who don't have families.  I am neither one, but got sucked into it for a while.  Then life called again and I realized how much of my life I wasted.  Everyone who plays this game needs serious mental help.  It truly brings out the worst in the human race.  I wanted to be able to play it with my son simply to enjoy the base building and resource collecting, but you can't do that because people just want to murder you and steal your stuff.  How can this be healthy?
this shit sucks, u cant decide your own gender, so if your a female you can never ever ever everveverv fuckin chagne it , this reASON ALONE is why i hate it and wasted my fucking money
It is impossible to select your Sex, that makes it impossible for Me to identify with My In-game character, and by this takes all the fun this game possibly would had.
wondered why i havent played this since the day i bought it. loaded it up and made it 30 seconds ( after 20 mins of loading screens) but every server just has people with bows and guns sitting at the beach killing new people who spawn. 10/10 wont install again
