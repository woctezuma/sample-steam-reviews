Great Game 8/10, kind of buggy with the grappler at times but great atmosphere.
Spoiler Alert Ending Theory

[spoiler]Just wanted to post my take on the ending. Fred was known to be able to climb mountains at the age of 52. Theres a newspaper on the wall in the epilogue that says that.

Fred probably died during a climbing accident by falling into a crevice or similar. His body has never been found (hence the memorial). 

The story is the story the kid made up in his head to imagine how his uncle could have survived, he viewed him as a genius (he was expert in quantum physics as a wall says), and imagined that in his ice tomb he survived with a mystical travel device, that he was living with happy and nice creatures in a small paradise inside the mountains... He imagined himself traveling in that world. just like his uncle did, to find him again, but, in the end, lose him forever (admit his death).

That's why you don't get to open the locker in the end, and there is no launch pad. That story never happened. 

That's also why the glowing message in the final ice room before you quit your uncle is translated "Acceptance".

Other secret words, once translated say "Denial" (portal) and in caverns "Anger". These are the common steps when you are in mourning (in psychology: shock -> denial -> culpability -> anger -> sadness -> acceptance[/spoiler]
I remember myself writing an E-Mail at the developers after finishing the game where I asked if there will be more. I was emotionally taken by this game. The world is wonderful, the story is really good and the characters are just likeable.  Do yourself a favor, take 3 hours of your life, grab something to eat and play this game. It's totally worth it.
A Story About My Uncle is a first person physics based platformer. The main character reads a bedtime story to his daughter, about his (You guessed it) Uncle Fred as you play through the game. You explore the deep caves and strange world as you try to find him. You are there to answer the many questions you have about your uncle and what he has done.

Overall Rating: It's a very fun and interesting game with fluid movement. It has a pretty environment and a good storyline, even if its kind of strange. If you enjoyed games like mirror's edge, I recommended playing this one through, just for the fun of swinging around like a crazy man. Buy on sale!

A Story About My Uncle is a narrative focused, first person platforming adventure developed by Gone North Games and published by Coffee Stain Studios. The game has great sound and music design, surreal environments, jaw-dropping visuals, and much, much more.

The story not only puts emphasis on the main plot and characters, but also on the side plot and side characters. You play as a dad telling his daughter a story about how his uncle, Fred, goes missing and how the dad goes after him. The father comes across his uncles' invention, a suit which has a grappling hook and lets you take no fall damage, to help the dad find his uncle. On your journey you will traverse through a multitude of different environments, while meeting numerous side characters that will help you on your way. The narrative is the soul of the game, but it's done in a simple and subtle manner that you, the player, have to explore and ultimately piece it all together.

The game focuses on movement, speed, freedom, and light puzzle solving instead of violence. Movement is the core element of the game. With the help of your grappling hook, you feel so free and fast; flying without restrictions and at uncontrollable speeds. It feels so genuine and fluid that it immerses you into this unique world. WASD moves your character, shift to sprint, LMB to use your grappling hook, Space to jump, hold RMB to power jump, and Shift and hold RMB for powerleap. Almost every new platform is a checkpoint where it gives you a certain amount of charges for your grappling hook. And then you have to use your charges and your skills wisely to get to the next checkpoint. Also, Later in the game you get rocket boots to help you through the harder parts of the game.

Like I said before, the graphics are very stunning. ASAMU runs on the Unreal Engine 3 and by god this game looks fantastic. It has gorgeous lighting effects, great world design, phenomenal texture work, and a fantastic attention to detail. Also the art style is very vibrant and dark at the same time; using greens, blues, and browns to convey the mood of the game. Sadly, character models are pretty outdated.

The sound and music design is absolutely brilliant. The sound is very immersive and completely engages the player into the game itself. The "Whoosh" that you hear when you soar through the massive levels is incredible and gives the player a huge adrenaline rush. The game exhibits an emotional, heart-felt, and melancholy symphonic, fantasy soundtrack. Voice acting is somewhat good and somewhat bad. The protagonist, the daughter, and the town elder are voiced well, while everyone else is poorly voiced.

[b]Additional Notes:[/b] This game has an FOV slider that can be adjusted from 60-120 FOV. There are 15 Steam achievements and the game is about 5-7 hrs. (depending on playstyle) and has a time trial mode. The game also features gorgeous water effects, best looking vegetation I've ever seen, beautiful architecture/ cityscapes, and stunning rock designs and textures. The devs are SO nice and are on the forums to answer questions and complaints!

[b]Final Thoughts:[/b] A Story About My Uncle is Gone North Games' very first game and it is a masterpiece with phenomenal sound, music, atmosphere, immersion, graphics, gameplay, and a gorgeous world to explore. However, the game does suffer from character models that are not up-to-date, ok voice acting, and a poorly translated script. Overall, I can recommend this game to anyone looking for an immersive first person adventure with an unique world and tale to tell. And is most definitely worth $12.99.

Honestly a very good game, kinda short but hey, there's still a time trial mode.
The story felt kinda bland but it still was compelling and made me want to commit suicide at the end.
Because the game is so short, the characters don't have time to make us develop a more than vague interest in them, and I truly believe that's a shame.
The gameplay was good, it felt nice, even though some parts of the levels were kinda confusing and I almost got lost going backtrack once (maybe that's because I'm completely stupid, but I hope not).
All in all, this is a good game, but sadly too short for its price... Consider buying it on sale.

[spoiler]You play as a person looking for "The Uncle" that has been gone for a long time. While you search for him, you discover that he has been studying things- things impossible in this world. Not only that, but you later find that he has a way into this mystical world. The Uncle has been studying this world for a long time, as is shown through the large collection of notebooks with extensive drawings on the creatures of this world, along with strange markings in the pages. Through his discoveries, you are able to take the passage into this world to try and track him down. While you search, you find clues and leftover inventions that he could not carry with him on his journey. These inventions are normally just fun new ways of getting from A to B. After a while, you discover a village filled with some kind of frog people, who praise The Uncle, and are very kind to you. They assist you in your quest to the best of their amphibious abilities. You traverse many obstacles and solve numerous puzzles to try and figure out where The Uncle might be, but you soon learn that nobody- not even the frog people- know where he is. After continuing your grueling search, you finally find him, and receive an explanation about why he left your world for this one, and why the frog people praise him- He was not simply a traveler that they deemed praiseworthy, he was in fact their creator, and even the creator of the entire world. After this explanation, you try to get The Uncle to come home with you- however, he decides to stay with his creations, instead of returning to his home. On this somber note, you leave him to his life, and return back to your home to tell of what transpired.[/spoiler]

[h1] Personal opinion [/h1]

I.	Love. This. Game. I have already beaten it once in under 2 and a half hours, but I plan to go back and play it again, both for secrets I missed, and foreshadowing I might not have noticed my first time around. This game gripped me like a vice with its captivating visuals and wonderful story- I really want to see more games with this much creativity. This game has a lot of charm to it, a good bit of peace, and a *shocking* lack of any rage for a first person platformer- it's very fair and lenient compared to others of its genre. It's an overall tranquil experience, but it is not without suspense for what will happen next. If you are a person who enjoys richly atmospheric games over intense action, this is the perfect fit for you. My main gripe with this game is the price: $12.99 USD for a very short game is a bit steep. While the gameplay is fun and the story is rich, the experience was similar to eating a delicious slice of pie (or cake, but as we all know, the cake is farcical)- it is great while it lasts, but at the end, you feel like there was a lot more than what you were given, and you ache to have just a bit more. I hope my opinion has helped you decide whether or not to purchase this game. Final recommendation: If you are a story and parkour fan, pick it up whenever, but for others, wait until it goes on sale. When it goes on sale you have no excuse not to buy it. No excuse. None. I hope I helped you all on your decision about getting this game. I 100% recommend this game!!

[Edit: Maybe I just suck at 3D platformers more than I realized.  So keep my warnings of "difficulty" in perspective.  If you're decent at 3D platformers, you'll be fine.  I don't want to scare anybody away from a great game.  Anyway, on with the review.]

It's possible this was the most difficult game I've ever completed-- with more deaths than I care to contemplate. [Update: okay, I probably died more in Ori.]  Of my listed 18.4 hours, I'm sure there was some idling there-- but not more than a few hours.  I also like to explore, enjoy the beautiful scenery, and take things slowly.  I never claim to be super-skilled at 3D-platformers, but this really stretched my abilities.  It was easier for me once I switched from a controller to keyboard+mouse, but I'm not much of a console/controller person.  Thank God the devs toned down a notoriously difficult section; I'm not sure I would have made it.  But the important part is that I persevered because I loved the game:  it had charm, a good story, superb graphics, and usually fun gameplay when I wasn't on the verge of a rage-quit.  ;-)  There's really nothing like flying through the air like Spiderman with a jetpack.  You really have to try it.

Some folks probably won't find it overly challenging and kudos to you-- but don't be surprised if it takes some real work and repetition-- I'm not sure why this game is put in the "Casual" genre.  Some of the difficulty can be alleviated at times by finding an optimal/alternate solution.  So if you find yourself stuck, look for an alternative approach instead of assuming the game is broken, unfair, or just poorly designed.  It's not-- it's probably you.

If you're looking for cheap achievements-- look elsewhere.  They are all actual *achievements* in the true sense of the word-- and I earned none of them...and that's okay with me.  I'll let the whizzes take on those challenges.

Other than the occasional clipping issue, I only encountered one bug (which actually made one section of the game slightly easier as it turns out).  So all-in-all an excellent effort from Gone North Games-- let's support them and hope they make more!
For as much as I hated the prospect of having to sleep as a child, the allure of a bedtime story almost completely put the displeasure of ending a day out of my mind, replaced with a rapid interest in what adventure I would hear about that night, which regardless of how flimsy the tale may be always held a sort of fantastical quality to it. A Story About My Uncle is itself a bedtime story, albeit one not constrained to mere words but created in vibrant detail allowing you to explore it for yourself while still retaining that magical quality that only comes from a friendly voice telling you a story before you inevitably shut your eyes.

While the title may lead to believe differently, ASAMU actually focuses on the titular uncle’s nephew; a daring young lad who, taking after his uncle, has an endless curiosity about the world around him and an irresistible urge to explore it. So it would stand to reason that upon visiting his uncle’s workshop and finding it empty, save a small futuristic suit in just his size, that he would strap it on and set out to find where his uncle has made off to.

Aside from the quick opening taking place in a setting resembling the one we ourselves live in, ASAMU is firmly planted in a marvelously imaginative world of its own creation. Huge floating rock structures populated with glowing foliage and villages of frog like inhabitants paint an enchanting local to explore, or simply admire from a standstill for its beauty. For as straightforward as the narrative is, the further I progressed the more intrigued I became about the place I was exploring, and longed to learn more about what had sparked all of it into being.

Unfortunately, ASAMU hasn’t anywhere near enough time to explore everything it presents before you, or in fact touch on anything for more than a brief moment before the end is before you after only 2-3 hours. It’s incredibly disappointing because developer Gone North Games achieves so much in this time in getting me interested in the world and lore it created, but ends the experience well before it has a chance to expand on any of it leaving me with a distinct lack of closure. It’s like having an amazing dream, and just as you’re beginning to get into it you’re woken with a start and no matter how hard you try can’t find it again.

When you art admiring the locals (or deploring their brevity), you’re soaring through the air using the prior mentioned suit, the abilities of which grant you an incredible amount of agility. The foremost of these is a grapple ability which lets you grab ahold of structures and use them to propel you forward. Combined with a super jump and sprint ability this creates an exhilarating means of travel, making you feel like a parkour running that’s made off with the claw from Bionic Commando as you rush through levels swinging from point to point. When you get into a flow it feels like little else I’ve ever played, and has me wishing more games attempted to do first person platforming this way, but here is you come up against a bit of a roadblock.

While the tools to string together grapples and jumps are all within your hands, you’re shackled with severe limitations on how you can use them which quickly turns to frustration as you find yourself repeatedly falling into bottomless pits. You are given a set number of grapples you can perform before landing, but levels are designed in a way that requires you to take a specific path through them jumping and swinging at just the right moment, essentially removing all form of experimentation from the player. There is so much potential here that for the developers to make such an easily remedied mistake is a huge shame, and one which greatly diminished my enjoyment of the game. I’d have even accepted an unlockable cheat which removes these limitations, as being able to traverse levels without constantly having to plan each moment out would feel incredible, but instead the mechanics hurt themselves by over restricting the player and taking away a lot of what could have been an amazing platforming system.

Even had it not come from a small studio, I would have been very impressed with the graphical work achieved in the environments and especially the sparse use of color to outline paths and present a contrast to the various areas you visit. Though largely taking place in caves, each level feels entirely distinct to itself, from the suffocating darkness of a deep chasm to the breathtaking vistas of a world existing above the clouds. Almost every moment offers an amazing view, made all the more exciting by the speed you typically move through them, and the fact it was accomplished by an indie developer makes it even more unexpected.

I do wish I could say as kind things about the voice acting, which unfortunately is among the worst of any game in recent memory. Full of awkward inflections and strange pauses, the cast does a rather poor job masking the fact they are almost certainly not native english speakers, and the strange disconnect between them and what they are saying makes it hard not to groan whenever someone opens their mouth to try and deliver a line. I don’t mean to be so hard on a group that seems to at least have tried really hard to give a good performance, but I can’t gloss over the fact that it’s just abysmal all around and had me tempted to turn it off entirely and get by on subtitles alone.

A Story About My Uncle is a hugely ambitious game for an entirely new developer, which almost inevitably didn’t manage to quite hit the mark. It’s riddled with flaws from almost every angle, which when piled upon each other make it a rather hard sell. Poor voice acting, frustrating gameplay design, and a shockingly brief length left me wondering if I could really recommend it to someone else. But for all its faults I still enjoyed the experience, for reasons I find hard to put into words. There is just something inherently charming about all of it, and perhaps I wanted so much for its mechanics to succeed that I kept going despite my annoyances. I can’t speak for others, but I suppose a lot of it harkens back to my love of bedtime stories in general, which no matter how lackluster they were I ate up with a ravenous desire for more.

In a lot of ways A Story About My Uncle left me feeling the same way as most of the stories I was told growing up; not entirely displeased with what I got, but saddened it had to end so soon.

[b]Full disclosure: A Story About My Uncle was reviewed using a review copy provided by the developer.

Fun little platform puzzler. Some nice graphics. Frustrating at times. Soaring through the air is great fun once you get the hang on it. Especially the outdoor level has a great feeling about it.

In relation to the rest it's getting kinda hard at the end. Do you remember the people complaining about the difficulty of Psychonauts' Meat Circus? Like that.
A Story About My Uncle is an amazingly smooth and beautiful puzzle platformer. You follow a breadcrumb trail to find your Uncle, Fred, through magical floating islands. This journey looks gorgeous, and the path is clear most of the time. The characters are likeable, but kinda shallow. This whole adventure is wrapped up in a frame story where you are telling your daughter a bedtime story. It’s honestly pretty cute, and there are a lot of small details like when you close the game, you hear, “I think thats enough for one night”
 
I had a few issues with this game though. About half way through the game, you get a pair of rocket boots that gives you a boost mid air. Most of the jumps don't require a boost, and I ended up using it as a crutch 90% of the time. I think that this should’ve been given to you in the beginning of the game, and then taken away halfway through. This would help players just learning the system, and add a layer of challenge to the latter half. Also, I found myself getting caught on the geometry of the last level.
 
Overall, A Story About My Uncle is a heckin’ good game. It has flaws, and I don't know if I would buy it for $13. I’d wait for a sale. 

Also, I should clarify: I got this game on Humble Bundle a while ago.
Well, This game was absoloutly amazing! Astonishing voice acting, exceptionally fun gameplay mechanics, And a really good story.

However, The story line is extremely short,  I completed it in around 3 hours, After that, there is nothing to do apart from Time trials, which is pretty much just recompleting the missions with your best time, Thats a complete downer. This game really needs a workshop where people can make, Play and share their maps with other people. Thats a complete bummer.

For the retail price of £9.99, I'm not really sure it's worth it, However, I would highly reccommend this game when its next on sale, As it really is that good!

I've never played anything like it, something about this game is so charming and hypnotising. And it's not just the graphics (which are by the way flippin' great) but the overall atmosphere and story, it keeps you wanting to come back. Love it!

A good game/story, too short sadly but I hope there will be a 2nd part.. maybe the small child who is being told the story enters the world? :D


Here the story of this game, be aware, **IT HAS SPOILERS!**


[spoiler]Fred was known to be able to climb mountains at the age of 52. You can see a newspaper on a wall in the epilogue stating that exploit.

Fred died during a climbing accident. He probably felt into a crevice or similar. His body has never been found (hence the memorial). 

The story is the story the kid made up in his head to imagine how his uncle could have survived, he viewed him as a genius (he was expert in quantum physics as a wall says), and imagined that in his ice tomb he survived with a mystical travel device, that he was living with happy and nice creatures in a small paradise inside the mountains... He imagined himself traveling in that world. just like his uncle did, to find him again, but, in the end, lose him forever (admit his death).

That's why you don't get to open the locker in the end, and there is no launch pad. That story never happened. 

That's also why the glowing message in the final ice room before you quit your uncle is translated "Acceptance".[/spoiler]
A really nice little game, that doesn't overstay it's welcome.  Essentially a first person platformer with a grappling hook, a jetpack, and a simple story.  Worth a look.
A Story About My Uncle is a puzzle game, that takes place when a father tells a bedtime story to his daughter of the Adventures He went on to find his missing Uncle Fred, who was also a world travelling adventurer. The obstacles are not to difficult, you acquire a grappling hook and upgrades making it easier to traverse various terrains. As you work your way through different levels, the father narrates in the background. There are collectibles you can get and the game offers trading cards. It isn't a bad puzzle game.
A Story About My Uncle is a game about a kid who sets on to find his lost uncle. He finds one of his uncle's inventions, a suit that protects him from fall damage and alllows for powered jumps and comes with a grappling hook that allows him to reach great distances and higher places. Using this suit, he follow his uncle's steps unto a wonderful hidden world.

The gameplay is very fluid and smooth, and I would say that is a mix between Mirror's Edge and Bionic Commando. The game continuously introduces new mechanics/power-ups throughout the game(like a rocket-powered boost), keeping the experience fresh, and it gets more and more challenging as it goes(but not too much), keeping up a good pacing between challenge, the introdution of new mechanics and the getting used to those mechanics.

The art direction is great, beautiful scenery and atmosphere. Great sights to check out.

The story is told as a bedtime story, narrated by the nephew of the "Uncle" to his daughter. It can feel somewhat rushed, with some things happening with almost no lead-up to that outcome. However, In general, it entertains well, there are some side characters that add up some variation to the narrative and keep it interesting.


Easily one of my GOTYs of this year. 8.8/10
A Story About My Uncle is a great first person adventure game that looks beautiful and has a simple, charming story with lovable characters. The gameplay is what's really fun about the game where you use a suit that let's you super jump and swing through levels using a sort of energy hook, which really gives you the sense of speed, flying, and freedom. But the game isn't long, it's about a 2 hour long campaign. After finishing it you can replay the levels normally or as a time trial. For me the game was worth it, the experience was great, fun, and heartwarming. 
The game would really benifit from a level editor to keep the game going with a lot of user created content, so here's hoping they add one.

A Story About My Uncle*

*Author's note: His Uncle is obviously Satan-incarnate.


+Wonderful Visuals
+Interesting mechanics

-Frustrating sections with sparse checkpoints
-Achievements designed by sadists
-Very short if you're not interested in the challenging achievements (5 hours)
4 out of 5

A Story About My Uncle is a first-person sci-fi fantasy platformer that focuses on simple yet enjoyable mechanics: run, jump, grappling hook, and rocket boots. The player is placed in the shoes of a father telling his daughter the adventure he had as a young boy in search of his uncle, an adventurer who had gone missing. The young boy came upon a intriguing mechanical suit that fit him and a launch pad that propelled him into a world full of wonder, intrigue, and a lot of floating rocks.

The good:

The environemt is really well-made and offer enough variety to let you forget that you are in caves 80% of the time. There were standard caves, dark menacing caves with glowing plants, ice caves, caves of floating villages, and caves of artifacts from another time. All caves were enormous, big enough to contain a whole city and then some. 

The art style leans toward cartoonish but fits quite well with the fantasy setting that requires a bit of suspension of disbelief (floating rocks, duh). 

The sound and music were well-done and serve the mood of the game nicely. 

The dialogue, though few, was quite decent and the voice-acting was excellent. 

And the mechanics are very polished and together the setting, the art style, the music, the sound, and the gameplay made up a very immersive experience. It is hard not to feel the pounding of your heart as you run, jump, grapple and slinghshot yourself through various terrain with incredible speed. The rush is there, but gravity never did forget you. I remember countless times where I miss the right timing to connect my grapple then look up as all rocks around me shoot up, the wind swoosh by. and everything fade to black.  

The bad:

While the mechanics were quite good. There were definitely a few places in the game where I felt there could be more  cues as to what can be connected with the grapple. In one instance I was supposed to connect to the stalacites on the cave ceiling to swing myself across, but no sound or environmental cues were provided. And I felt frustrated as I tried to super-jump myself across but inevitably fell to my miserable death every time. At another time, there were these glowing crystals where the player is supposed to use in mid-air to charge the grappling hook and further the swinging distance, but for a quite a few of them no matter how close I get no charging was possilbe. And so I had to plan my route not using them. Note that these frusrating intances are far and few in between, and the developer are still releasing patches, so I remain hopeful that they will be fixed in due time.

final words:

If you are looking for a neat game you can enjoy in an afternoon, and the idea of being Tarzan swinging in fantastical caves intrigues you, then consider "A Story About My Uncle." It is an atomoshperic, narrative-driven experience that takes you away to a different world one swing at a time.
The game is extremely short (2 hours), and the gameplay is often frustrating due to lack of consistency (grappling failing), but it looks all glowy, mysterious, and kinda cool. Also it clearly has a lot of heart (stay until after the credits). There are defenitely better games out there that remind me of this type of gameplay (e.g., valley!), but if you like glowy crystals and swinging like Tarzan, this game will not disappoint. 

Graphics 7/10
Atmosphere 9/10
Sound 8/10 (but use a popfilter for maddy next time!!!)
Gameplay 7/10
Value (costs/gametime/replayabilty, etc.) 7/10 
Overall 8/10




A Story About My Uncle is a first person platforming adventure game about a boy who searches for his lost uncle, and ends up in a world he couldn’t imagine existed. Take help of your uncle’s mysterious inventions that let you jump incredibly high and far through beautiful scenery, uncover clues to your uncle’s whereabouts, and meet fantastical creatures that will help you on your journey. 

It was too short (I completed it in 2h + Some extra content) but in overall it was a fantastic experience. The gameplay is really unique and innovative and swinging over huge distances is really satisfying. A must buy for everyone!

Soundtrack is beautiful and the graphics are very good!
I just finished this game and I must say, while it is a short game and you would not have a problem finishing it in one sitting, I believe it deserved at least a 80 on metacritic and they where a little harsh on this game for it to receive 73. The graphics are stunning which goes great with the intersting and unique movement system and plot line. Overall I think you will be very well satisfied spending $12 on this game. And to the devs, you all did great on this game and I think I speak for the magority who have played this game, PLEASE make some sort of sequel to this game and if you do, please make it a little bit longer. But still, great game.
[h1]Intro & Summary[/h1]
This is one of those little hidden gems that nobody talks about because it's not incredibly new or unique, it's just very well done and good fun. From the team behind Goat Simulator, it was one of their earlier titles and it flew under the radar for most. [b]It's a relaxed, sweet story world to explore [/b]which doesn't do anything special, and that's fine.

[h1]Highlights[/h1]
A Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer that isn't anything special, it's not unique, it doesn't have a new incredible story, it doesn't go above the norm on any of it's design choices. But it's great fun, the story is interesting, the characters and atmosphere all work and [b]it's just a good honest game[/b].

* A compelling enough world and story with enough lore to go back and look harder on a second playthrough.
* Absolutely gorgeous artefacts and atmosphere.

[h1]Mistakes[/h1]
Surprisingly, there are very few faults with this title. It lacks the polished feel the triple A's command, but that adds to it's charm.

* Some annoying level design problems from time to time.
* Collectibles are pretty bland and boring.
* Plot/story is great, but runs thin at times.
* Far too easy overall.
* Short play time, even for it's low price.

[h1]Recommendations[/h1]
It clocks in at just 4-5 hours play time and doesn't have much re playability, so getting your moneys worth matters with this one. At £9.99 or $12.99 at the time of review it's not going to break anyones bank, but like most games on Steam, it's probably worth picking up on sale, perhaps at -50% or less. I haven't seen it in any Bundle deals so don't wait for it to appear on HumbleBundle et al.

* Gathering the collectibles will lead to unlocking Goat Mode, a reference to one of [url=http://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Coffee%20Stain%20Studios]Coffee Studios' other titles[/url], Goat Simulator.
* This game uses the Unreal Engine and includes console access to modify/play with your world including [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=435446127]flying, and taking better screenshots[/url].
A Story about my Uncle was a unique experience for me. The game is quite short and it took me a little less than 6 hrs to complete it. The story is fairly simple and straightforward as the protagonist narrates a story to his daughter about a journey that he embarked on to find his beloved uncle's whereabouts when he was a kid. Coming to the gameplay, this is exactly the department where the game has something new to offer to the players. The core mechanics of the gameplay involves crossing various levels ranging from frozen caverns to paradisal floating city to mystical landscapes by means of a grappling hook. It can be quite frustrating at times to progress through some parts of almost every level given the challenging level designs. Timing and patience is, more often than not, the key to successfully cross those hurdles. Barring those, the gameplay is actually quite fun and somewhat makes you feel as if you're a superhero as you fly high and soar through the levels. The visual fidelity is quite decent. It is more of an artwork with good colour contrasts. The enigmatic and imaginary elements of the game world adds to the overall graphics quality as well. The ambience in-game was very good as it incorporates a sense of calmness and keeps you hooked to it throughout its entirety. The controls were quite responsive. Didn't have any problem in that regard as well. On the other hand, the achievements are tough to unlock in this game too. So a heads up for the achievement hunters out there. There's also a time trial mode where you've to complete the previously completed levels within a limited time. And that pretty much wraps up my review. 


P.S-There's not much replay value to it to be honest. So get it on a sale. Once installed sit back and relax and enjoy this game on a Sunday afternoon. You won't be disappointed! :)
A Story About My Uncle is an excellent 3D platformer with a charming storyline, and relaxing soundtrack. The level design is great and Star Haven is just beautiful to look at. If your looking for a 3D platformer look no futher. This game is very much worth your time.

Comment: The game is AMAZING. One of the best single player games I have ever played. The story and the atmosphere.. everything was just fantastic. Loved the ending it was so touching.. This game needs a sequel or a part 2 someday.. I just wish the boy could stay with his uncle.. and maddie and the frog people!
My rating would be 10/10
Where do I begin with a game that is so adventurious yet repetitive. First off let's start with what most people come to see for the first time with this game, the graphics.

[h1] The Graphics[/h1]

This game is nothing short of beautiful, for it to have been made over two years ago (as of the time this review is being made). The game has aged very well, some triple-a titles can't even look this wonderful, from the gorgeous lighting and shadows to the smooth physics and motion that you receive while grappling, but I'll talk more about the way the game works shortly. This is singlehandedly one of the prettiest indie games I've played and well worth the $5 that my friend spent on it in order to give it to me as a gift (Thank you Ryan c:). Even the landscapes and models are well detailed, from pieces of paper and bottles that you'll find laying around, to the beautiful skybox that inhabits the world, this is a masterpiece of an adventure. The only downfall is the character models, the (lizard?) people that you encounter seem to look a lil cartoonish and have strange ways of walking, it seems like the developers kinda skimped on them entirely, but not on the scenery, which I guess I can forgive since they made such a pretty game.

[h1] Gameplay[/h1]

Now this is one of the best parts of the game, in my opinion. The parkour elements and skills that you need in order to dodge and seemelssly jump from platform to platform, from ice spikes to landing pads, it's wonderful, really! The way that you run and grapple onto platforms isn't clunky or too difficult, the right amount of timing and luck will get you through the levels in no time at all. Overall the gameplay itself has a unique feel, if I could change anything I'd make the height of your character just a tad taller, you seem to be a lil too close to the ground when you're freerunning through caves.

[h1] Story[/h1]

[u] Okay this is the bread and butter for this game and there will be spoilers ahead so if you haven't beaten it yourself, stop here.[/u]

This game starts off so spooky and strange, the atmosphere is dark and omniscent and hell I'd even say it looked like a horror game if it had some depth of field, but it doesn't. You play as a man, telling his daughter a story of his Uncle and the adventure that he undertook in order to find him, and then return back home. During the story of this game you come along a girl by the name of Maddie, she rides on your back for a majority of the time that you'll actually be playing, and she helps you along the way by giving you hints and decoding the texts on the wall in order to reveal where you are and where you're going. The parkour elements that I discussed earlier really do set the stage for the adventurious feeling that this game gives off, you actually get immersed within this short story. As for the ending of the game, well the way that you find your uncle and then leave him within meer seconds of seeing him kinda disappointed me because you only said a few words to him, and then left. He didn't even thank you for finding him, he just left you on your marry way and he stayed behind in the chasm to live out his adventure. After the credits there is an epilogue and you find yourself walking through your uncle's abandoned home, explaining how the adventure you undertook meant a lot to you and your daughter and you are proud you could undertake such a journey in order to find your uncle and bring your soul serenity and peace from the worry of wondering what might have happened to your uncle if you never went after him. I'd be lying if I said I didn't tear up when you let go of the note/picture of you and your daughter and it flies up into the night sky, as you say thank you to your uncle for making all of this happen. 

[h1] Summary[/h1]

This story is wonderful, although short and sweet. If a game can make me cry, laugh, smile, and feel angry within a playthrough, I'll give it a solid review. And this game, well it did all of those including the first one, which is rare. Overall I'd say this game is a solid 10/10 and you should pick it up if you have the chance, you can find it on sale here and there or cheaper on some third party sites, but it's well worth it. It took me a little over 2 hours to complete the story, and it's a story I'd play again if given the chance.
A Story About My Uncle is a hidden game among the thousands of game on steam and it's incredibly fun. 

The game follows on a dad telling his daughter a bed time story about the time he went to look for his Uncle Fred using his invention which is a suit equipped with a grappling hook.

The story isn't really that in depth and the reason you might want to check out this game is the gameplay itself and the game is rather fun. The best way I can describe this game is imagine Mirrors Edge without the parkour element and you got up to the high places using a grappling hook.

In general this game is rather simple and is easy to learn, so you pick up really fast and you have a ton of fun playing it. 

You swing from place to place to get to Uncle Fred and you visit some really breathtaking locations. I mean a lot of these locations look amazing like the Ice Caverns, the windmill land and the other locations as well.

Graphically the game looks great, some of the locations look breathtaking and are amazing to look at, but this however can't be said about character models.  A lot of them look really ugly, but you only see live creatures for fraction of minutes so it doesn't really annoy me that much.

Game is around 3 hours long, but it has some replay value like a timed mode and collectibles, which would make the game around 5 hours long or even longer. I paid a single euro for it and I definitely had an amazing time playing this game. 

A Story About My uncle is an incredibly fun game. It doesn't have a ton of depth and it's a simple pick up and play, but with the short time you will spend with this title, I think you will enjoy it.

Final Rating:
7.5/10

Pros:
+ Incredibly fun gameplay
+ Great environments 

Cons:
- Short
- Controls take some time getting used to

You might call A Story About Mu Uncle a joy-of-movement simulator.  It's focused on jumping and grappling huge distances and the short-form resource conservation puzzles involved.  It's pretty simple--easy to learn, almost as easy to master--but also satisfying to play, pretty to look at, and over well before it's worn out its welcome.  

There's also a saccharine-sweet narrative delivered through some charmingly accent-stilted voice acting.  Both can definitely be rather awkward, but ASAMY's story has this comforting sense of earnestness, which helps overcome its stilted delivery and well-tread themes.  It feels entirely divorced from adult self-awareness, both for good and ill.

Definitely give this one a look.  It's a really enjoyable way to spend 2-3 hours.


A Story About My Uncle. (ASAMU)


When I saw this game on the Steam frontpage it was love at first sight. Normally I wait for a discount, and then just tuck the games I find interesting in my backlog, but ASAMU was different: I bought it at full price, downloaded it and finished it in one sitting. Even though I throughoutly enjoyed the game, admired the visuals and find (most of) the story interesting I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game, I'm not sure if I can even say that it's a good game. Third person platforming is one of my favorite game genres which is sadly neglected, ASAMU much like Mirror's Edge offers the thrill of leaping through huge depths, and the feeling of freedom (have you ever dreamt that you can fly? well it's a bit like that) Let me elaborate:

1. Graphics:

Pros:
+ Beautiful scenery and landscapes.
+ True feeling of depth below you.
+ Smart camera movement making the jumps and movement more immersive.
+ Perfectly optimized, runs flawlessly on a mid-spec laptop maxed out.

Cons:
- Low-res immersion-breaking character models.
- Somewhat inconsistent art-style. 
- The visuals don't really support the story. 

2. Gameplay:

Pros:
+ Interesting equipment upgrades like "laser grappling hook", "rocket-boots"
+ Smart platforming puzzles. 
+ Constant sense of adrenaline-rush and challenge. 
+ Intuitive/easy to learn controls
+ The lack of any violence, and death when falling makes the game unusually soothing and relaxing. 

Cons:
- Unintuitive checkpoint system where the distance between the chekpoints grow larger and larger.
- The fast-paced gameplay slows down and stalls in the later levels.
- Unfair difficulty spikes. 
- Trial-and error puzzles (you can't do it at one try, you should die 5-50 times before you figure out)
- The hardcore precision-platforming requirements at places may scare away newcomers to the genre. 
- Short gameplay time (I finished it in around 6 hours in my slow-pace most people finish it in 2-3 hours) 

3. Story

Pros: 
+ Sort of interesting premise
+ Interesting narrated gameplay (like Bastion), however it becomes inconsistent and scarce as the game progresses.

Cons:
- Terrible, terrible ending (oh god why), I just stared at the screen feeling cheated. It would have been better to not have a story at all!
- Uninteresting characters, cliché dialogues. 

4. Music/Sound Design

+ The music is cool, but nothing to write home about.
+ The sound design gets the job done, nothing impressive either. 

Verdict:

If I'd be objective I'd give ASAMU a score of 60/100. It was sort of a financial flop, and not a commercial success either (according to Steamcharts 166 players played it the most, currently has 2 players active).  It has an interesting concept but sadly it falls short in delivering, the story feels terribly rushed (like they wrote it 20 minutes before released) the gameplay although fun has it's flaws which combined with the story (in a supposedly story-rich game) just can't make it.  

However I still recommend it, why?

Because I can't say that I didn't enjoy the game, I mean I finished it in one sitting that's something right? It's just a lovely short game that I recommend to pick up on a -60%+ sale, and you will enjoy it if you are aware of it's limits and lower your expectations accordingly.
God bless Steam! I can’t stop praising it for making it possible to make new cool connections and meet people around the world with common interests. These people always remind me about some games, that I had on my mind for a long time and then forgot. 

But what is much more important is that games they recommend me always fit my mood in a proper way, just like in a right place in a right time. The same happened to me with A Story About My Uncle. I had a bit harsh weekend, which started with fixing my broken PC on Saturday, then I was forced to do other stuff I really didn’t feel like doing and after all these events I felt like I squeezed lemon, so I really needed something chill, relaxing and just kind, without any violence. So, after a quick conversation with a friend on Steam, I realized, that I bought this game few years ago, I guess and still never touched.

And that was a mistake! Or not? Maybe this game was waiting for a proper time and it only came now? Anyway, I always have this feeling, like, why I never played it earlier, when I find something really cool and amazing in my library all of a sudden. A Story About My Uncle starts as protagonist tells a little girl bedtime story, so she can fall asleep. He decides to tell her a story about a sudden disappearance of his uncle.

You come in your uncle’s house and looking around for him. After climbing up on atticus, you ended up with finding a suit, that your uncle invented and you decided to wear it, like I don’t know, for no reason, at all. I mean, that was a bit confusing for me, just don’t get me wrong - you come into someone’s place, looking for the master of the house, then you find a suit and you think like, oh let me try it, why not? :) Of course, I understand that it’s a bedtime story for a little girl and you can’t be so strict about it, but in terms of starting a story that part confused me a bit at the start.

Right after you fit something that doesn’t belong to you, an enormous atticus window opens and you teleport to a weird place with little flying islands. Your reaction is kinda like wow, oh my god, where am I now, what’s going on here, but you are not gonna be overwhelmed for a long time. Just in a few seconds you will already understand somehow, that this suit is not just a fashionable suit, it has interesting abilities and of course, they come handy just in time. 

Game introduces you to a grappling hook on your glove, set on a LMB, which will be the most frequently usable gadget during your adventure. The trick is that you will have to travel from island to island, using that hook, grappling on stones located in the air between them. The more you proceed the more features of the suit will become available to you, like boosting yourself off the ground after holding and releasing the RMB button, or rocket boots, activated by pushing spacebar. As being a classic puzzle game, where you have to reach to your destination using all these features, all these suit powers will works in a best way ever when they are combined. For example, you have to sprint on the ground, holding the RMB button and then release it right near the edge, to boost yourself in the air, hook the nearest stone and then after realizing the next stone is quite far, spam a spacebar button to get to it. In addition to it, you will have a limited amount of hooks, so you won’t be able to spam LMB hoping that you will catch a flying stone one way or another, sooner or later.

At some point, during your adventure, you will find a village with weird froggy-alike creatures, which will answer some of your questions and will help you, guiding your way to uncle and telling you about this world and its secrets. These creatures represent a really important part of this world and this charming story as well, you will understand it closer to the end of the game. 

The good point, that you will not be stuck only somewhere high in the air, jumping around the clouds from one island to another. You will also be able to explore greeny villages, dangerous caves and icy terrains, as well, so you won’t feel like you are stuck at one place. 

Of course, my favorite part of the game is the narrative thing. During your adventure, the protagonist will be explaining everything for the little girl, commenting on every dangerous situation or an item found in caves or whatsoever, that makes connection to the story and tells more about mysterious uncle disappearance in this fairy world. That, without a doubt, my favorite part in games, when developers work on the dialogues and telling you a story through the protagonist’s lines. Little girl seems to be really confident and has a big mouth, so time to time you will uncontrollably smile on what she says. 

I can highly recommend this game to someone who is in love with short, touching, well-designed indie games with a soul and kind atmosphere, without any violence at all. It would be a cruel move from my side to call this game relaxing, because at some point it can be a bit challenging, and at the end of the game, on the last level there is a chance that you can smash your screen! But, in general, this game has a message in it, of course I won’t tell you which one, because it’s a massive spoiler, but it’s hard to argue with a fact, that mixing action puzzle jumping-platformer game with a touching story is a really brave move, that worked out really well!

Ok, to sum everything up!
You should grab this game if you:

+ Love nice charming games
+ Eager to play something short and nice
+ You love all these games with puzzles where you have to travel from one point to another, finding a best way to get from point A to point B
+ Fan of an atmospheric games with warm graphics and beautiful sceneries
+ The idea of adventure and travelling is your thing
+ Love all these cool gadgets, with grapple hooks, super jumps, etc.

Recommend to avoid if you:

- Although, I said this game has warm graphic, it looks a bit outdated from technical point of view, especially the faces of froggy creatures
Enjoy!

[h1]Short Review[/h1]
This is definitively one of my highlights in my SteamLibrary. The design and gameplay is awesome. All the controls are very smooth. You can jump, high-jump and far-jump between platforms and you can use the grappling hook to reach each platform very easy.

Highly recommended for all indie and platforming fans. Even if you don't usually play platformer you should give it a try.

[h1]Design and Sound[/h1]
These developer like details. Its is awesome what you can discover in your journey through this world. I didn't expect that much from such a (relatively cheap) indie game. I made so many screenshots and will most likely use some of them in my desktop background cicle. The designer made sure to create a wonderful dream land.

[h1]Gameplay and Controls[/h1]
Well this a platformer, so you will mostly jump and grapple between platforms. Using static and moving objects to reach your target. Although I enjoy most games with a gamepad I had never tried it with this game. But in the options the gamepad was availabe for use. You can change key mappings, but I choose not to, because the default mapping was just fine. 
It was a little hard at the beginning to use the right mousebutton as power jump, but I got used to that after couple of minutes.
Besides the story (which I finished in about 2.5 hours) there are time challenges, collector and minimum-grapple-use challenges. To be honest, they are not easy.

[h1]Achievements[/h1]
There are not many story based achievements. In fact you don't have to do any of them during the story. There is the typical "Collect everything" and "Explore everything". But the other are just skill based. For example do every part without failing or with at maximum of grapple uses. These achievements are really challenging, so you will have to exercise each level a lot.

[h1]Rating[/h1]
I will rate this with a solid 10/10. The story and graphics are so good. And the challenges extend the gameplay by many hours.
Cool story, Unc.

A Story About My Uncle is an adventure/platform game; it offers an interesting concept, but was it exploited well? Let's see.

The story starts with you, telling to your daughter a bedtime story about an adventure you've experienced as a child. Of course, you get to live the adventure.
A kid of not specified age finds some sort of space suit into his uncle's closet. This suit looks just made for him. He then decide to wear it and place himself into a strange teleporter. This shoots him into another dimention, made of flying rocks that he can swing on with his special [strike] Spider-man web [/strike] magic glowie beam that he can shoot out of his [strike] Iron-man suit [/strike] glove.

First thing you will notice about this game: the stunning environments. Each stage haves a different one, and they all looks very interesting. Well, maybe the last one won't be looking really cool, because it's just a ice mountain, but we'll get to the final part of the game. Oh boy, we will.

The voice acting is pretty decent, not the best quality you will find, but still enjoyable; same goes for the music, appealing, but not very memorable.

The gameplay works very well, M1 to shoot the beam that will drag you around, M2 to load up your super jump, and later on, spacebar while in the air for rocket boots (also, expect a dumb brony reference after you'll get them). The first person model animations are very well made, but the camera angle doesen't make me look like a little kid at all. And having an adult grunt when the character fall from a huge heigh doesen't help.

But here is something that bugged me a little: the level design. 
Much more I was going on, much more it felt a little bit repetitive. Sure, the story was proceeding, but I didn't really been following that because was pretty cliché and expecially they whould spoil you pretty much all the biggest twist with some question that the character made to himself. Is like that guy that while you watch a movie says "oh, I bet now this is gonna happen", and that actually happen. Is kinda frustrating.
Anyway, about the level design, it wasn't only done pretty badly, but also there was no sense of progression. You can take the first stage and then pass to the last stage, the level of difficulty is pretty much the same. And expecially, [u] there could be way more  gameplay elements then the one we got. [/u]
For exemple, at one point there will be a giant monster. They could have added a way to actually fight it, but nope. We got Red Light-Green Light game. Great.

And then the last problem with this game: [b] THE F*CKING RUSHED FINAL. [/b]
If there is something that I hate more, is the feeling of not have achieved something in the end. And this game passed that line.
After a boring normal puzzle, you finally get to the ending. You will then take part of a scene (pretty much like Half Life 2, there is no actually cutscenes into the whole game) and then the game ends. There is no boss fight, no final time trial puzzle, nothing. Just a 2 minute stupid, [b] stupid [/b] dialog.
Words cannot express how much I hate this kind of finals, and this really makes me even more angry, because I want to like this game.

But still, I would reccommend it. 

[h1]Final score: 6/10 [/h1]

It's fun, it has an interesting concept and the 3-4 hours long doesen't make it way too much boring. Still, the game fell with the final. 
13€ may be too much for this game, I would suggest getting it for 5-6€ on a sweet sale.


Even Goat Simulator had a better ending then this, damnit.
[h1]"A Story About My Uncle"[/h1]
(The combination of puzzle and arcade game where speed and precision is very important.)

Game that allows us to impersonate nephew of scientist, inventor, uncle Fred.

What is this game all about? 
Father puts daughter to bed, but she did not agree to sleep until she hear a bedtime story.. Dad goes to the memories of event in the past, when one day he came to Uncle Fred's home. But he did not find Uncle at home. Instead he met there an amazing suit and then accidentally moved to another world.

He turned out that the suit in the new world gives amazing abilities. 

The main part of the gameplay makes a great impression - [u]high jumping[/u], [u]flying in the air[/u] on a special beam of energy, snapping to objects and after unlocked [u]rocket boots[/u] - everything works really effective.

A Story About My Uncle chain us to a monitor with fairytale atmosphere. 
Like the entrace to the world of dreams - [u]lovely[/u] [u]landscape[/u] in pastel colors and all this highlighted by a [u]brilliant[/u] [u]soundtrack[/u].

Cons: [u][b]disapointing ending..[/b][/u] 



Bought this during the Steam autumn sale for €2.50 and what a bargain it was!
This is a first-person single player game where the aim is to make your way through obstacles using different kinds of leaps as well as your grappling device and rocket boots (you will get the rocket boots in Star Haven). 
The game looks very nice visually with vivid colors and runs smoothly on normal computers; I believe you will not have a problem running it unless your computer's performance is ridiculously low.
The fact that there is no multiplayer may lead to people not buying it so if you really dislike playing alone don't get it.
However, when you grapple (at least at first) you feel like a total badass and as the obstacles become progressively more difficult you feel a certain satisfaction once overcoming them. 
The achievements are fairly challenging and you will need to master the game in order to get them which is a fun challenge for those of you who are achievement hunters.
The gameplay lasted around 5 hours for me. I did not try to find collectables or interact with objects because I didn't know the game well enough so 5-6 hours is a good estimation of what the game should take at a reasonable pace.
Overall, this is definitely a fun game even though it's offline so as I said, if you only like playing with other people do not get this, but I recommend finding it on discount and buying it off Steam because it is definitely worth the €2.50 that you will pay!
[b][h1]SHORT VERSION[/h1][/b]
A Story About My Uncle is a fantastic First Person puzzle game. It has excellent story, the 
graphics are beautiful, and the gameplay is challenging, but fun. The ending is a cold hard slap
back into reality, and every part is fantastic. Long story short:
"Oh, there's a huge gap! [i]energy grappling hook go![/i]"
[b]Fwoosh[/b]

[b]Graphics[/b]
The graphics on this game are downright amazing. This has to be one of the most beautiful games 
I've ever played.  From the caves. to the stars of the floating rocks, to that weird worm thing. 
What [i]was[/i] that thing? Anways, graphics are a 10. I had to remove a point because of a key 
factor this game needs: [b]Oculus Rift support.[/b] This game would be absolutely amazing with it. 
They are running on Unreal, so they should be able to do it.

[b]Gameplay[/b]
The gameplay of this game is amazing as well, giving the perfect blend of difficulty and fun, while 
also allowing a bit of roaming. There are hidden collectables that unlock unlockables, like 
changing your beam color, to turning into a goat (yes, really), and story collectables, which add 
extra narration. Removed a point for shortness, maxing out my run at around 5 hours, and the 
replayability isn't that great. So, 1 point off there.


[b]Story/Lore[/b]
The story of this game is fantastic. It is narrated by the protaganist, telling the story as a 
bedtime story to his daughter. The story is amazing, and the ending is absolutely fantastic. The 
hidden story collectables really add on to the story, making it a lot better. What this game lacks 
in game time, makes up for in story.


[b]Controls (Keyboard}[/b]
I find this game best played with a keyboard, which is  a rare thing for me. You need to react 
fast, and sometimes you can press your mouse faster than compressing the trigger, so I have to say 
keyboard is better, neither set of controls are bad, just personal prefference.


[b]Controls (Controller)[/b]
[i]Played With Wireless Xbox 360 Controller[/i]
Like I said before, faster to click than to compress, so I really don't have much to say here. Both 
controls are great, neither one is bad, and both can be used. There is a bit of a delay with 
wireless 360 controllers, so I removed 2 points.

[b] Review [/b]
A Story About My Uncle is a parkour, grappling hook, platformer game. I found the story to be mysterious, and the art style to be one of my favorite. The voice acting wasn't anything amazing, but it wasn't terrible. It's definitely one of the games you have to pretend you are in the shoes of the main character. This game is pretty easy for the most part, but there are some tricky spots. I really enjoyed this game, but I do believe that it is overpriced. I would recommend this game to people that have a good imagination, and I would recommend this game when it's on sale.

A Story About My Uncle has a very misleading title. Gameplay wise, it boils down to a fantasy-nearly-no-gravity-parkour-simulator-fable-adventure.

What sounds weird at first, is a very strong indie title with great environments, endearing art design and a very entertaining journey.

While not too long in itself, it does feature time trial mode and a few challenges and the entire game design is so much fun that there's actually reason to rerun some of levels to try to find the fastest and most effective route through.

Content wise it's a small game, but well deserving to be played.
Really surprisingly fun game, some of the best first person platforming I've ever played. The different mechanics work really well, and the physics are good.

Don't play this if you are big on easy acheivements, if you aren't following a guide they aren't going to be prevalent. That said, if you don't really care about 'em, then you should jump in.

A word of warning. There's a late game difficulty spike that is epic. Truly, the first ~70% of the game requires some finesse, but nothing crazy, then suddenly you need to be on your game. Luckily the checkpoints are mostly pretty good, but there were more than a couple times I was nearly sweating from tension.

If you like grappling hooks and platforming, you will likely enjoy this game.
A Story About My Uncle takes you along on fun but short story. You relive a story you´re telling your daughter about how you went out and searched for your Uncle. The game has amazing graphics and a great atmosphere. And while grappling yourself trough the world it´s really tempting to just stop and watch the scenery for a moment. The world is interesting and keeps you guessing what it really is from time to time, but sadly never really explains it. The mechanics of the game are fun and exist mainly out of your grappling hook and your jumping boots. The game doesn´t really have much replay value unless you are going for all the achievements which can be hard to get, after completing the game i still have 0 achievements.

Overall, i can highly recommend this game to those who are looking for a short and interesting game.
Basically in this game you're Spiderman looking for your Uncle the Hermit in [practically] zero-gravity places! From the beginning you're equipped with some sort of a robotic suit that allows to do long jumps, power jumps and hanging. A bit difficult at some points, it's like the game Deadcore with some kind of a story. If you're not into challenging-platformers you might get frustrated and lose focus on the story.

---info---
Beautiful environment (trippy:P)
Short-story narrated adventure [spoiler]5 levels[/spoiler]
Calm soundtrack (background effects mostly)
Not so deep voice acting
Dev. should have add some form of puzzles in the story.
Most Achievements are for Time Trial(speedrun) not for story completion.
Funny unlockables if you gather all the collectables.
...
If you are intrigued merely for the story, consider buying on a sale.;)

The story of [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] is expressed through the medium of a father who is giving a bedtime story to his daughter. 🛏️📖 He tells her the story of his Uncle Fred, who's mysteriously disappeared when he was a young boy. By taking on the role of this nephew, it is up to you to find Uncle Fred's unknown whereabouts.

[h1]🎮 [u]Gᴀᴍᴇᴘʟᴀʏ[/u] 🎮[/h1]
At the beginning of the game, you are given a grappling suit that gives you the power to jump incredibly high and leap across extreme distances. This suit allows the wearer to harness the power of a crystal 💎, which emits a beam that acts as "sticky" rope, allowing for extreme mobility to climb and swing with ease through the environment. Equipped with this ability, you are able to grapple many surfaces and swing freely from platform to platform in a first-person perspective. However, the length of the beam is limited, and the number of times you can you use the grappling beam is also limited until you touch the ground again. Therefore, this can deem as quite the challenge when going through difficult and complex environments. The player will be required to have precision and fast reflexes to effectively traverse across the world.

[h1]🖌️ [u]Gʀᴀᴘʜɪᴄs ᴀɴᴅ Dᴇsɪɢɴ[/u] 🖌️[/h1]
The levels are made up of five worlds, each decently increasing in difficulty. Each level will introduce a new mechanic that is fairly easy to learn and put into practice. The worlds are all magnificently crafted, featuring areas such as lush, canopy-like jungle, a dark, ominous cavern, or absolutely beautiful clusters of floating islands in the sky. ☁️

Each environment of the worlds in [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] certainly holds the aspect of quality over quantity. While there are only five worlds to go through, each one had me bedazzled at how attractive they were. Although being quite linear, the game will give you some opportunity to explore these worlds, by hiding collectibles and different interactable objects that will tell you more about the characters' backstory 🏕️. Finding the secret collectibles will also [spoiler] unlock some bonus perks for your suit and grappling beam, which I definitely had fun playing around with[/spoiler]. There are some additional achievement challenges for each area that will give the game some replayability for those hardcore players.

When I played the 2008 first-person parkour game, [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror%27s_Edge]Mirror's Edge[/url], I would often wonder what it would be like to jump and swing about the City of Glass using a Spiderman-like web mechanic. [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] was able to bring this past concept to life for me 💓 (minus the parkour element of course). While I would have liked to experience more of [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b], it still does offer an adequate amount of gameplay and fun for all players, casual and hardcore.

😎 Remarkable, I say! 😎
How dfaq I never knew about this game?!
I recently saw it being played on an old video of some cancerous chin-defficient YouTuber, and I really liked it, decided to check it up and possibly buy it - but I already had it in my libary (probably from some bundle I got years ago).

Graphic is simplistic yet very well utilized (charming and very creative, reminds me of Psyhonauts), story is almost non-existant yet competent and unimportant, but the most important bit - gameplay... is what games should be like. Free flowing movement is extremely satisfying and puts you into that zen state most of us started playing games to begin with.

For negatives I have only two very petty things: its very short game (If you are not IQ defficient like me to get stuck on some very simple puzzles, its probably 4hrs of gameplay in total), and it subscribes to that old school achievement idea where they do not give you achievements for 1st time not crappying your nappie; in this game you have to earn them! I finished the game completely in fairly competent manner, and got 0 achievements unlocked. So if you want achievements - youll have to earn them!

Conclusion? There is no reason not to play this game! If you get trough some rough patch in your life, this might actually help a lot cos its very relaxing, and it costs dirt cheap on any sales.
One of the best 2.2hrs spent on a game in a while. It's not the graphics, but the the storyline that mesmerize you and you feel addicted to the game, to know what happens next in the nephiew's story. I highly recommend this game. The only negative thing i find is that it was so short, would love to see something similar but a bit longer from a storyline perspective.
[h1]  Introduction            [/h1]     
	A Story About My Uncle is a first person platformer. The game slowly works the various mechanics into the game and I found this very refreshing. The game was never insanely easy or difficult, the devs got this perfect. Even if you mess up there is most likely a check point very close by. The story is interesting, but sadly it is insanely short. I was able to finish it in under 3-4 hours, and the ending is very abrupt. Along with that, the models for the frog people are very odd looking and awkward. Other than those complaints the game is very enjoyable.

 	A Story About My Uncle is an enjoyable experience, until you reach the end and realize how short it is. The gameplay is very fun and the story is rather interesting. There are issues with this game, but it would be 100% worth it to pick this hidden gem up on sale.

The graphics are really stunning esp. the art style! The controls are quite good and the game runs pretty dang great !

The story is amazing however short!

Pros: amazing graphics/art, Really good story, Controls

not good or bad: very repitive at times.  =====> keep in mind its a physics based game thats hinged around story and parkour

Cons: the game should be a bit longer but if you see the game on sale snatch it up

overall great game thats held back by the overall game legnth more then anything and somewhat lack of exploration!
I just finished playing this game and WOW...  This  game...  This game is more then just a game.. It's a adventure. A journey into a whole new world. It's so beautiful, relaxed, atmospheric (...) and something you have never seen before. 12.99 is a very good price for a game like this. Play it until the end, it worth it.
The most beautiful looking bedtime story that I was ever told.

This game is definitely worth a playthrough. It's laid back and not too long.
The visuals are stunning and it feels satisfying flying through some nice looking landscapes.

There's not too much story as all you are doing is progressing through to find your lost uncle,
but the short dialogues are enough to give you a sense of purpose for continuing on.

Think of this game as a 3 hour interactive movie. Worth the watch!
My Personal Rating,

Story:                   8/10    
Gameplay:           9/10
Graphics:             8/10

Voice Acting:       8/10
Music:                  7/10

Total Score:          8/10

Replayability: No, Unless for story and gameplay.
Full Price Worth: Current Price = 12.99 (Euro) -> Yes

Thanks for your time :), and Game On!
[b]This is a long review, so if you want a brief summary of why I recommend [b]A Story About My Uncle[/b] skip to [u]Results[/u] and read from there.[/b]

Gone North Games creates a thrilling first person platformer that offers a fantastic story with challenging gameplay. A Story About My Uncle is a fine example of a casual, yet challenging platformer experience filled with beautiful environments.  

[b]Story:[/b]
A Story About My Uncle involves the story of a boy, most likely a teenager, who is alone in his uncles cabin surrounded by tundra. The game starts as the boy recalls a story about his uncle and the interesting life he led. As you play through the experience you slowly end up living a wonderful adventure of your own while learning about the amazing world your uncle has created.  As you explore through caverns and floating islands you meet interesting characters who help piece together the gaps within your uncle’s life while forming your own story.

[b]Campaign:[/b]
Overall the campaign is a decent length, you’ll probably get anywhere from four (4) to eight (8) hours of gameplay out of this. If you want to find every secret you probably could spent a significant amount of additional time playing the game. The campaign offers a variety of different environments, but ultimately it is relatively repetitive. You’ll go through caves, some floating islands, then caves with floating islands.
The achievements act as challenges for this game rather than progression points, so despite the game essentially just being the campaign you could go back and play the levels as challenges to get the achievements, but realistically this has no impact on the actual game itself. 
The campaign is relatively easy, which perfectly suits the design and style of this game. You may die a couple times as you go through, but the smooth checkpoint placement and relatively simple puzzles make this game fun rather than annoying. 

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
As platformer FPS style games go this one is pretty good with the controls and hit boxes. You’ll find yourself rarely thinking that you should have landed somewhere you didn’t or hit something you would have missed. As the game is an FPS you don’t have to deal with poor camera elements as you could see in an third person platformer, but with this same light you’ll also find you may need to have your sensitivity up high if you need to make a quick turn-around. 
The game plays off you having a power suit that adds functions throughout the game, but honestly you’ll find that you essentially only unlock three abilities and they are all pretty basic. You’ll get the ability to jump higher, the ability to propel forward, and a grappling hook. You’ll essentially be using the same abilities throughout the game to solve relatively similar puzzles. 

[b]Results:[/b]
I’d recommend A Story About My Uncle for anyone looking for a relatively casual, yet immersive experience. The gameplay is somewhat similar to mirrors edge in that you will be running and jumping, but focuses more on utilizing your power suits special abilities to propel yourself through puzzles and into unique places. I personally grabbed this game when it was 75% off, and would recommend doing the same; but, if you absolutely love platformer fps then this is the game for you and you might as well pay full price. 

Pros:
+Decent graphics and visuals
+Relaxing soundtrack
+Good story
+Platformer FPS with some puzzle elements
+Good check point distance (making dying less annoying)
+Decent length

Cons:
-Relatively repetitive gameplay style
-Repeating environments
A Story About My Uncle, pros & cons.

Pros :
- Amazing graphics!
- Great movement system, all aspects of grappling, boosting just work so well!
- A very peaceful game, something to relax.
- Amazing ebb & flow.

Cons :
- A very short game for 12€
- Rushed story
- Lack of interaction with village characters (I think it would add some spice to the game)
- A companion who spams you with "Hey! Hey! Over here!" until you reach her. ( HEY! LISTEN! )
- Game builds affection between main character and a companion in less than 2 hours. 
- Some dialogues tend to be a bit dull.

The game looks great, movement features work wonders and there is no trouble in finding the correct path, good map planning. However, the game is simply too short, I feel like a lot of content could have been added. More topics should have been explained and developed. Game feels rushed when it comes to story : beginning of the story seems fine but its later execution went poorly.

The point is, it would be fantastic if the game was cheaper or longer (or both). Get it during cool sales  so you can have a proper length to price scaling. Otherwise, a game worth playing.
The title may have you slightly puzzled, it did me if im honest but....when i started playing it straight away it was obvious this game was going to be both beautiful looking and fun !

the setting is so pretty , the gameplay is like a futuristic fairytail parkour style game. sounds odd but it works.

this game deserves to be played & is a nice welcome to alot of unimaginitive titles that get popular and are not as good. give this game a try youll see what a awesome game it is.
[h1]A game with really fun challenging gameplay and a beautiful atmosphere to go along with it.[/h1]

[b]My only negative is that it comes a bit short and falls on the bland side of story telling
with nothing happening that feels shock worthy.	[/b]
[b]It's also very friendly on being replayable and offers collectables to find spread out
over the game[/b]

[spoiler]The end is a bit disappointing[/spoiler]
Game is mainly about sort of "parkouring" around.. You get to jump and move around with a grapple.. Even using some kind of a jetpack later in game. It is fun.. Enjoyable and can be frustratingly challenging at times. Story is okay. It is just there to sort of provide you with an ultimate goal.. Something to go through while actually playing the game. I don't honestly find it that amazing.. It is an average one.. A bit above that at best.

If you are the kind of guy who rather jump around in minecraft than walking as a normal person would, or rather jump through roofs in an Assassin Creed game to reach your target than storming the streets killing everybody on sight dark-souls style.. Then i believe this game will suit you just fine!!!
Hi guys, I just finished this awesome game.
Seriously, this game is amazing.
This game relaxes you, be sure to take a cup of tea or coffee before passing.
The story is great, at the end I just cried, I would really like to see a book about this game: D
Perfect graphics
Everything is done very high quality, I'm surprised.
If you can't do something, you're not angry, but just trying to do it somehow differently. Pleasant music
Nice characters
I really love this game, and I would like to see the continuation of this story. It is a pity that it was all over.
Have fun, friends:3

As weird as it may sound, first off,
[h1] Do NOT judge the game by its name. [/h1]

This game is an absolute gem, a gem I tell ya!
Its parkour like fun game mechanics with gorgeous level design, engaging story and sweet in-game soundtracks, makes it an absolute must buy as a PC exclusive title.

The game is a tad bit short, around 3 - 4 hours for completion, however there is a lot of replay value as the game is ridiculously entertaining and there are achievements to collect! 

It'd be great if only there was a free roam mode, where you'd swing around for as long as you want. 

Nevertheless, I would love to play a sequel to the game! Really anticipating it!

With that said, I conclude my review by saying: [spoiler] m8 no h8, just apreci8, it's gr8, I r8 it 8/8, it's a f9 b8, get it m8. [/spoiler]
interesting and very enjoyable game which finished way too quickly. the achievements aren't easy to unlock,  the game itself is amazing; great story and even greater graphics.
[H1]A Quick and Nice Little First Person Platformer.[/H1]
Campaign will take only a few hours to complete but there's a good amount of replayability with the time trial challenges for each level. Good controls, level design, a cute (family friendly) adventuring story and full controller support.
-Max :steamhappy:
Fun game. I finished it in about 2 hours but didn't really go after all the achievements. I would've liked an hour or two more of story/gameplay. The platforming could be frustrating at times but I was never really stuck anywhere. Runs great on linux!
Smooth gameplay topped off with beautiful and diverse scenery even on my hunk-a-junk laptop.  Wish there was more to it, I had a blast playing it.  GG
Overall this is a pretty good game. The gameplay is fun but in my opinion a bit too easy, not for people looking for a great challenge. The graphics are pretty decent and if you finish the game quickly, you can always restart and find the collectibles which unlock new things. The reason why i don't think this game is amazing is because the storyline is weak and boring. It has, or had the potential to be a beautiful story, but it is almost non-existant.  Still, this is a fun game which i would recommend for most people, especially when on sale.
Great game! 

Pros:
-Great game mechanics (responsive, fast, fun)
-Game graphics are nice
-Game feels really satisfying to play (get that dopamine discharge on every succesful manouver)

Cons:
-Characters are insipid (specially villagers)
-Game is too short (2 hours should be more than enough to complete)

Conclussion: buy this boii

This is a first person platformer where you navigate levels with a grappling hook-type of device and rocket boots. There are a few parts that I found pretty tricky, but I found the game challenging enough without being too difficult to complete after enough deaths/tries. The environments in several of the areas are really cool and nicely done.

I liked it. The later stages of the game, after you have all your abilities available are fun; recommended if you like first person platformers.
This is a pretty good game. I don't know if I would buy it for it's regular price, but if you can find it on sale, it's probably worth the money. Another cool thing about it is that it can run on practically anything.
pretty alright game that manages to make first person platforming work (for the most part) thanks to generally forgiving level design with a lack of precision platforming. there's a few aggravating sections in which this is not necessary true but for the most part it's a very enjoyable platformer with fun grappling hook mechanics that doesn't overstay its welcome
You know, normally i'm the kind of fan of crude humor and over the top action, I saw the parkour aspect of it and said "Hey i'll give it a go" but it's good to the point where you begin to notice the details and it's a story that tugs on your heartstrings. Not gonna lie solid 10/10 it's short but it's like one of those sweet stories i picked up off of my uncle bob, heh what a coincidence.
Ok not gonna put it lightly, it only had about 2 hours worth of gameplay. Which was dissappointing. NOW after saying that I will say this is one of those games that you complain about it being to short because you want more of it. This game gave me the feeling of Dear Esther with the mechanics of Mirrors Edge. The visuals are absolutely stunning. The gameplay itself is very fluid and nice. The only con is, is myself wanting more from a game that is already perfect. Great game, will play through again multiple times.
[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is by far the most atmospheric, gorgeous, and immersive puzzle game. [i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is a first person platformer, a genre which until this game, I insisted could never measure up to its far superior third person cousin. Surprisingly though, the tight handling and impeccable accuracy in this game was enough to rival and even surpass that of most third person games with ease.

While the gameplay is amazing and is enough to support the game on its own, the amount of gameplay the game consists of isn't so great. The story is rather brief after my experience playing it. Moreover, the models' graphics seemed pretty low end, however the environment was astoundingly beautiful. Consequently, the game did work extremely well with what it had. While the graphics might have been below AAA quality the environments were amazingly done and the creatures were unique and imaginative. I can only imagine what the developers could have done with a bigger budget. The soundtrack really helps complete the atmosphere too. I’ll admit that there was one point that genuinely had me shitting myself. Now if that doesn’t speak wonders for a game's atmosphere than I don’t know what does.

[i]A Story About My Uncle[/i] is an amazing and completely unique experience. There is only one big problem with the game and that is the length. While the gameplay and world is perfect I just don’t know if I could justify buying a three hour long game for the price it is at the moment. The game was easily good enough to have been much longer without wearing out it’s welcome and I was genuinely disappointed that it ended so quickly. If you can stomach the price then I would completely recommend it and if it’s ever on sale then seriously, waste no time! Get it played!

So, to sum it all up thus far...

[u]Pros[/u]

--Amazing story
--Alluring environments
--Great animations
--Challenging puzzles
--Intreguing characters
--Can take some splendid screenshots

[u]Cons[/u]

--Poorly made models, especially the character models
~~~~Does not correspond with environment
--A rather brief story
--Almost too simple
--Relationships don't seem to last


All in all, I'd rate it 7.5-8/10
Well, this game is awesome. The puzzles are nice, the challenges challenging and the story okay. But I can't help myself to notice, that there is a big amount of levels missing in this game. Right before the last level it just felt like the devs decided to make the game shorter, than it was supposed to be. Another thing, that wasn't cool was the outro. There are many glitches at the end. Most of the levels got the problem, that you could land on a little invisible corner, instead of dying by falling down a cliff. That made most of the challenging levels a little too easy. Another point were the boots...they just made the game too easy. 

But still this game is awesome. If you have any kids, buy this game, because it is fun and kids-friendly.
My love for this game has no limit.

I played most of it with a controller but would advise to switch to mouse and keyboard towards the end where accuarcy is key.
Simple mechanics and a relatively easy start that ramps up through the story makes for a very fun platforming game. Although not graphical impressive, the story, voice acting, and soundscape more than make up for it. Seriously, play the game with headphones, the spatial.. awareness(?) in this game is fantastic. The grappling/swinging mechanics can take a bit to get the feeling of, but by the end i was feeling like Spiderman. Although short in gameplay hours, i enjoyed every minute of it.
Would recommend(Have recommended matter of fact)
10/10 Graphics/Visuals; It's got a rad atmosphere to it.
10/10 Soundtracks
10/10 Storyline

If you're lookin' for fun single-player, story driven, atmospheric, Indie games, this right here is one of 'em.
Awesome game!
I had a ton of fun playing it , the storybase is pretty decent and every world has it's own unique beauty and style to it!
I recommend this cool game to any adventure lover! 

I'd say this is a pretty good game. It's short, so it's perfect to get into when you can't invest too much time in games for whatever reason, or maybe you use this as one of those 'in between' games you play when you're not sure what big game you wanna jump into next. 

The platforming is good, but it can feel a bit floaty; sort of like you're lacking momentum at times. 

This game also has a story, and just like in the title of this game, it's a story about your Uncle. It's rather interesting and I like how the story is narrated by a father telling his daughter a tale of his past regarding him and his Uncle. The voice acting is surprisingly well done, especially by the father.

The graphics; they get the job done. Up close, it ain't much to look at, but when you view these landscapes at a distance while traversing the stages, they can look pretty damn cool.
A game you play because you want to experience and listen to the story. With that comes the only minus in this game; the teller/character you play has a really annoying accent sometimes. Made me wish several times I could just read the subtitles instead of hearing him. :^)

Overall a great game, got some difficult stages where, atleast, I ragequit and came back the next day to complete it pretty easy. Cute and spooky.
The game is amazing
Graphic : 10/10
Story : 11/10
Music: 10/10
it's amazing when u can feel the movements of ur character 
U should try it at least one time
and it's fast to play and fun too.
WOW! 
I just finished the game and it just blew my mind! 

It felt like a dream and it was a wonderful one, i dont even know what else to say.. 
It is an amazing experience and you should definitely try it!!

10 / 10 !!
An immersive, extraordinary game, tha reelly dirrerent from the others. The game itself is simple but very enjoyable.  It is exciting and also cute. I never have a so good experience like this before.  It is a short game, but it is worth that small amount of time.

I finished the game from zero to hero in 3 hours.
I loved ASAMU it was a wonderful narrativley told story that had such amazing graphics to it. I loved the voice actor and his ability to tell the story while I was re living my moments as a crystal freak spiderman. The ending was absolutley amazing! Well done guys!

I must admit to passing this game over time and time again in my library, it was just,.. unappealing to me, however taking a deeper look i found a game with gorgeous art, decent but not perfect voice acting, simple yet enjoyable puzzles and all built on the awesome Unreal Engine 4, an engine that could not have been better chosen for a game like this, bonus points for a camera view that  doesn't act like a drunk sailor, it felt tight, crisp and responsive very much like the controls and animations used in the game itself.

This mini review is part of "10 Games that are worth a second look"
https://bluntlyhonest.review/2019/02/20/10-games-that-are-worth-a-second-look/
Got the game for free from the dev's free copy giveaway

Not really into this type of games, bu this one really gave a good impression. Definitely worth skipping class just to get a key
You might want to wait for a sale for this one. However, if you're looking for 3 solid hours of relaxed, leaping fun (more if you want the achievements) then I'd recommend this game. I love the mechanics and the upgrades you get over time. The story is okay but isn't compelling whatsoever. Level design is usually good and quite aesthetically pleasing.

The only two things that I really couldn't stand were the characters/NPCs (frighteningly robotic movements and frankly terrible voice acting) as well as the sudden ending. You're hopping around having a blast... what's this? The game is over?! I feel like the game was cut short, which is a shame. The ending had real potential to be emotionally moving, but I just hadn't quite developed a connection with the characters. In the end, [spoiler] you find your uncle, he sends you back home, and voila he's gone again here's a memorial for him in his old house. [/spoiler]
Heartwarming, short but memorable experience with lots of attention to detail in easter eggs and very nice art direction. Who doesn't love some grapple mechanics a la Spiderman?
The main (and huge) downside: achievements have been designed terribly. What should remain as chilling, almost-ASMR dialogues become unbearable lines that you are forced to listen to over and over if you want to make the perfect/limited grapple challenges. Maddie used to be my adorable companion in my first run; now that I'm hunting the achievements I want to shut her mouth for good so I can skip the mandatory dialogue scenes. Grappling is often not user-friendly AT ALL, with corners and collisions that interrupt the player's run and force him/her to start all over again. Almost seems like levels have not been tested fully to check if the achivements are viable.
But really, it's a very good game if you play it only once and will take you just a few hours.
The game and music are both very good. But once you get to the "challenge" part where the Girl riding your back (don't remember her name) challenges you to get through a section without using the grapple. Heads up, turn off your voice volume. Every time you accidentaly use your grapple she says in an annoying voice "Haha, told you you couldn't do it!", you'll get annoyed by it very quickly
The spiderman simulator you never knew you wanted. A touching story, great soundtrack and good level design. Finished the game in 3 hours in my first try with half the items collected for the unlockables. It was hard enough for me to die over 100 times but balanced enough to let you pass after a few tries. I did survive in a few places by landing on spots not planned by the game designers (I mean I abused the physics by accident here and there) but that only added to the experience since there's more than one way to progress (some times). Quite enjoyed the ceiling grappling section at the end when at first you just have to boost down and trust that the developers actually put something there to hang onto. But there were a few areas where I was cursing the developers for not putting any checkpoints and forcing us to go through everything in one go... although with enough attempts you get used to those as well. Really liked the game as an experience but I don't think I'll try to grind for the other 12 hidden items. Looking forward to more games from this studio
Got this game for free (forgot where maybe reddit or humble) and didn't really play it. It was sitting in my steam library for a month or two when I got bored of my current games and decided to try it out. It blew me away. The gameplay was simple yet unique, and the story was astounding. If you are ever browsing for a new game or want something random to play I would highly recommend you play this.
I very liked it! Everything is on point. Aside from some glitches, but still I would give it 9/10.
Really recommend this game if you like Chill & Backstory games. Been a nice adventure to find Fred. Hopefully there's a Part 2 of this game.

Thank you for making this game!
Pretty cool first-person 3D platformer, with very high jumps, a grappling "hook", and a short burst jetpack. Haven't finished it yet, but it seems worth a few hours of play before I'll get sick of it. It's on 75-80% sale pretty often, so definetly worth a go if you are interested.
To start off, it's a great game with a great mechanic and I would recommend the game if you are looking to have fun. The game overall isn't too bad to play although its not the most complex and the story is very short (2.5-4 hours long). If you are looking the play the game for the story, I would strongly not recommend the game based on the story, but for the fun factory. The game consist of 2 characters whom you would find through out the game: your uncle Fred and a humanoid frog named Maddie. As you explore around with the grappling hook (gloves?), you slowly unlock upgrades which would help last you on your journey to meet your uncle. Now enough of this and lets get to the pros and cons of the game.

Pros:
+Fun mechanics involving with the grappling hook as you play the game.
+A nice game to play when you have some free time to spare around.
+Good sounds.
+There were some levels which were a bit difficult to pass.
+The upgrades is a pretty nice addiction to the game.
+Overall, a chill game to play if you just want to waste some time.

Cons:
-The story is very very short (2.5-4hrs).
-The story isn't all too complex. Don't buy the game for the story.
-The voice acting was just horrible.
-Most of the levels were just plain too simple and easy. 
-The characters absolutely made no sense at all.

Neutral:
-The graphics are alright for 2019, but they weren't bad to say the least.

Overall, the game itself isn't too bad and if you just want to have fun with some spare time, you should play it just for the sake of having fun. Just don't delve too deep and find a complex story because you won't.
i loved this game.easy gameplay and good a good story.it was beatiful UNTIL  i saw a character in game.it was just so bad.this game was 9/10 if there wasnt any npc.but now after that eye bleed its 5/10.
A really nice game. I feel that gamemakers should strive for this kind of game, it presents you with controls, let's you get familiar and then ramps up the difficulty. I feel that it could benefit from being longer however, otherwise 10/10.
Edit: After playing the game more it has replayability, but it's just not enjoyable. For example, I wanted to get a few of the achievements such as completing a level under a maximum amount of jumps or without dying, but you have to complete them in story mode for it to count. This means waiting through cutscenes and having to go back to the menu to reset. I also feel that although the chasms level is interesting when you first play it from a narrative standpoint, it just becomes uncomfortable when replaying the level on its own. Revised score 8.5/10.
This game. This small Indie game. It touches you in the sensitive points of your soul.
The Game play is relaxing and amazing. Graphics are pretty good. 
And The story? Well; Let me tell you A Story about my Uncle.
The End is just - wow. Cried a bit. My Uncle died when I was 8 - Not a lot of memories from him. But the ones I do remember - are good and joyful ones. So this game touched me. Thank you for bringing back those memories. 
Thank you Gone North Games & Coffee Stain Publishing. Just a whole big thank you. <3


This game  has an amazing story, and very immersive. I was into the game the whole time, and it was a blast the whole time. I never got bored, but the game can be somewhat challenging  at certain times.  Overall, it was really enjoyable and beautiful.Thumbs up. :) Would definitely play a sequel.
A charming little game with fun platforming, a cool world to explore and a simple but nice story. Definately worth a buy. Been hoping for a sequel for ages but I don't think it will happen. :(
This game was up for grabs for free some time ago, and being curious as well as a freeloader, I leapt at the opportunity.

I just finished playing it and the feels are still overwhelming. I have next to no spatial awareness and sense of direction, I'm an expert in getting lost and am afraid of heights, yet I could get it done in a single 3,5 hour run. But those 3.5 hours were full of feels, good feels. Maddie, the villages, the sights, everything was friendly and comfy. 

Even though I fell maybe 50-70 times, I never felt annoyed by the level design (which in my 20+ years of experience is a rare pleasure), and I could even laugh at myself. There was no pressure to excel or achieve, just go find your uncle. Even when Maddie posed her challenge, it wasn't frustrating, or something for the elite few. so when I actually managed it, it gave me a purer sense of pride and accomplishment than many big budget games out there.

Thank you very much for giving this freeloader so many good, warm, fuzzy memories.
I like how the game never tells you what you should or should not do to get past an obstacle, and that they give you opportunities to be creative with how you advance in the game. You could sail through the story by using the grappling hook extensively (but not exclusively), or you could add some power jumps and sprints into the mix if you feel like you don't want to swing around so much.

The graphics are good, and I even found myself staring a lot at the landscapes across multiple levels. The story itself is sweet, and even if it is a bit short, I enjoyed it all the same.
This game is extremely relaxing. The story is pretty basic but not necessarily in a bad way. It’s a fairly quick game to run through but I don’t regret buying it at all. The main thing I like doing on this game is mostly just speed trials. I recommend this game if you’re looking for something short and sweet or just looking for a game to listen to music and chill out on.
Played With: Singleplayer, Mouse & Keyboard; Pro Switch Controller, Windows 10

[h1]General Thoughts: [/h1]
-This is a really fun puzzle platformer, it's short, sweet, and to the point. It's a unique game akin to Portal, but instead of solving puzzles using the portal gun you're figuring out traversal patterns you need to take using your spiderman hand 

[h1]Pros: [/h1]
-Spiderman: The main mechanics of this game are running, jumping and swinging around like Spiderman. The progression of unlocking more abilities and interacting with different objects in the environments makes for a good pace and a nice new challenge. The feeling of accomplishment is great especially after you’ve been beating your head over a difficult part and the game rewards you with a freeform easy to navigate section right afterward. 

Navigation/Puzzle: The game is a puzzle platformer the main puzzle in the game is figuring out how to traverse to the next area. It doesn't directly tell you how to get from point A to point B but the environment is clearly designed leading you in the general direction and you have to give it a good look around. Sometimes the game will even throw a few red herrings in your way so you have to be observant as to where you should be going. 

Environment: The game's environments are really beautiful and varied from each section. Between jungle caves to caves filled with darkness to open sky to ice caves, there is a ton of variety in what the world feels like. Alright so there's a lot of caves but the games make a good job making each fill different between dealing with a monstrous worm to using falling stalagmites to traverse each one has a unique mechanic that changes up the gameplay. 

[h1]Neutral: [/h1]
-Story/Characters: The story is kind of bare minimum, you are the narrator and you're telling a story of how you went to a strange world and looked for your uncle. Throughout it, you meet like two or three characters who just kind of go along with you. A lot of the dialogue is told through clunky lines like “I don’t fit in here” and “I wanted to protect her” even though none of it is shown. Whenever the narrator is talking it's relatively fine and enjoyable but when you interact with characters it a bit lacking. The game also gives you extra story bits if you find random things in the environment to trigger it, it's a nice incentive to explore but it hinders the game's story further if you haven't found all of them. 

[h1]Cons: [/h1]
Humanoids: As pretty as the environments are, the humanoids in the game are terrifyingly unnerving. They try to make them move and look around as if they were interacting with each other but it just looks stilted and unnatural. Their eyes are so large it's hard not of focus on them and they just blankly stare off into the distance. It just makes them creepy looking. 

This game is great in my opinion. The game is perfectly balanced between challenging and fun. I never found myself stuck for more than 3 min. The story is great and nothing feels forced. I would recommend picking it up if you have the chance!
I'm not a single player guy. Haven't played a single player for more than 5-10 minutes in years.
but
I loved this game. The story, the voice, the mechanics. It felt like I was no more a 22 years old man, but a 8 year old that is listening to a story. I wanted to discovery more and more. 
I even made small brakes just to make the story/game longer. I didn't want it to end.
I don't know the exact words to describe my feelings with this game, but I'll try my best.

First question: do I recommend this game? Eh, maybe. It really depends on what you want out of it. 

Do you expect a great story and world to get lost in? Don't buy this.

Do you expect a fun mechanic, albeit one that isn't explored to its full potential? Buy this.

Do you expect a well-designed physics puzzle game akin to Portal and Quantum Conundrum? Don't buy this.

Did you like the grappling in Batman: Arkham Asylum and wish somebody would make a full game out of it? Buy this.

---

PROS:

- Really good graphics.
- Fun easter eggs, a lot of neat nods to Goat Simulator (another game by these devs).
- Fun mechanics when the devs actually decide to use them.
- Being short, it's a great timewaster for the afternoon.
- Collectibles, albeit 25 of them total.
- There is SOME story, although I found most of the characters unlikeable and the sense of "purpose" to be all ove rthe place. In this game, your goal is to find your uncle, who got lost in some alternate dimension(?). [spoiler]You find him, you talk for about a minute, and then he sends you home and you never see him again.[/spoiler]
- The sound design is top-notch, except for the voice acting. It can really do without all that.

CONS:
- Puzzles are too obvious, you're in for one of those "follow the shiny markers" Q.U.B.E. type adventures.
- Mechanics sometimes just don't work. God forbid you click too fast.
- Items come and go. You'll see game reviews say things overstay their welcome, but this game does the exact opposite. Hell, [spoiler]one part rewards you by giving back an item they took away for no reason.[/spoiler]
- I seriously hate the characters in this game, all of them are either annoying or not very smart.
- Just when you think you might like this game, it ends. It's only about 2 and half hours of gameplay if you don't plan to 100% it, not worth the price.
- Unlockables just step on top of eachother. [spoiler]You get to change your laser color, and then it doesn't matter because it's replaced with a goat tongue.[/spoiler]
- This game explains nothing. I don't know where I am, I don't know what anything is, I don't understand the logic of this world. There's no lore, and no expansions that might explain the lore.
- I still don't know what the hell that skeleton wants.
- While all-around a pretty decent game, minor negatives add up and ruin the experience for me. Is it bad? No. Would I recommend it? Only if you REALLY wanna play it.

This game has been haunting me for weeks now. I don't think I like it, but it was good enough for me to go ahead and finish it. If it's on sale or free again, go ahead and try it, I guess. This isn't Might No. 9 "dear god WHY" bad, this is just "clearly an indie game that bit off a bit more than it could chew" mediocre. I'm voting "no" becuase I wouldn't play it again, but clearly a lot of people enjoy this game for the pros I listed. Up to you, man.
Kinda crappy tbh. Its a super cool concept and mechanics start really nice but the further you go and the more mechanics are introduced the sloppier it gets cause the mechanics arent tight or responsive enough. Its also super buggy, ive fallen countless times cause the grappler just wouldnt grab onto something that was clearly reachable, gotten stuck on walls several times, and numerous other annoying albeit minor bugs.
Level design leaves a lot to be desired, especially with such a potential for something exceptional in this area, but apparently its still important to keep kilometers of space below most levels just so you can fall and have to wait half a fuƈking hour to respawn.

Idk, just a lot of things rubbed me the wrong way about this game and they kept piling up to the point were i just couldnt recommend this.
Cool, potential, but just super sloppy execution.
The game has nice graphics and art style, although the quality of both is inconsistent. Same goes for the level design which dips down the drain right after the first level. And the first level is a very good looking level i must say, almost deceptively good, abundant with details such as little notes replete with text , some photos and items, all that little details that gives story a context, which is always good.

The story is cute, i guess. I don't really want to say  anything negative about it. Anything that is not "kill that guy, he be mean" is already a plus, in my book.

But the gameplay, the gameplay is just a gigantic bore, lackluster. Run from one rock to another. Jump the rocks. Hover along the flying rocks. Seriously it's all you freaking do there, and not much else. The game seems stretched just for the sake of longevity, just so you don't refund it.
I found myself wishing the platforming part to end at about 15 minutes in. You jump the rock - then you jump some other rock higher up thinking it would be the end of the torture , only to find more of the same dull goddamn platforming action. Worst of all is all the dull moments are followed by almost complete silence from the narrator, because some story would greatly make up for some  the tedium of the gameplay mechanics.

I also feel like i shouldn't really compain, about it all since i got the game for free and all. But honestly i played it for 30 minutes and it already bored the hell out of me, not sure what other great adventures waited me there - i think ill better go watch the grass grow. If you respect your time - i advise you to choose some other game to play. Unless you are autistic or you just enjoy the monotone action, in which case - go ahead !
I would not recommend this game because for the first 30 min you know what your doing but the next 1hr and 30 min is just complete bullshit. You dont know what you are dong or where you are going. My friend played this game and agreed with this. It only takes 2 hr to complete.  The story is good especily the suicidal girl who jumps of a cliff several times. In the last part i might have been stupid but i had no clue what i had to do and i found the way out by complete chance.

Overall i would not recommend this game. Its fun and is short. But Bullshit at some points.
If you see the demos and screenshot and wonder "Is this game for me?" don't get this. 

If you're curious and say to yourself "Oh this sounds like it's got an interesting mystery" don't get this.

If you say "Oh yes! This is definitley a game for me!" then get it- But be warned, it's short.

Now to be fair, my play time on this game isn't long. I got about halfway through it. 

Yep.

It's that short.

Go check some YouTube playthroughs if you think I'm pulling your leg. I watched the rest via two hour long video. 

Positives-

The gameplay is good, solid and it's pretty much what you see in the demo videos. 

The envronments are stunning. The game looks amazing, mostly.

Negatives-

It's short for the regular asking price. Get it on deep discount.

The creatures and 'people' are fugly. But it's okay, that's not the focus of the game.. speaking of..

The Story. Okay, it's called "A Story About My Uncle" and shockingly there's hardly any story.  More below in the spoilers but the game sets up a premise of a mystery, something odd.. and it delivers a mysterious land.. and.. nothing much happens.

That's what irked me the most. The story is a big letdown.

-----------spoilers--------------

A few things-

The game is short, so there's a mere three enviroments; realy stunning ones but that's it.

That one boss monster? Hope you liked him, there's no more and no explination for it.

Speaking of explinations the plot sets up a mystery of why your uncle is gone, what's going on, where you are and who are these frog people?

The frog people get explained by an off handed comment.. you final dialouge with Fred is short, and it's the end of the game. Nothing happens after that, you're done. 

Magic crystals? No explination

Fabulous super suit? Meh

Where this place actually is? Newp

HOW THE FROG PEOPLE.. nothing

And worse still, you get signifigant interaction with One, count her One person and she's litterally a voice over your shoulder for most of the game... and then poof... all the sudden.

It's just, a let down.
Hey you. Yeah, you. The one looking through the reviews to see if you are interested in buying this game. You are most likely here because you happened to find this game on Steam, and realized that Leafy used it for some of his videos back when he was relevant. I was just like you are now, accept I didn't look at any reviews. Well, I'm here to tell you that I have never disliked a game as much as this one during my initial blind playthrough, and just in 2 hours I have a multitude of complaints that I should not have.

I will give this game a few positive remarks:

The gameplay has many minor innovations that make it feel fairly well polished. It starts very basic, but you end up with many new abilities I never would have thought I could have gotten at the end, and I can appreciate how this game plays (mostly). A minor issue I find with the gameplay is the new abilities not being added to the help menu. I played about an hour of the game, sat on it for a few weeks, and came back to forget about an ability I had just picked up. The game had no indication I had just picked it up, and I had to go watch a speedrun of the section I was in to realize I had picked up a new ability before I quit playing that made the section ahead of me possible.

The backgrounds are pretty neat, especially the one in the second to last section where you can see the last section off in the distance. There weren't any times I was taken aback by anything presented visually in the game, but there is clear effort put into the backgrounds and sceneries and I have to point that out as a positive.

But that's really where the positives end.

The thing I see the most from other reviews are complaints about the abysmal story and voice acting, and this is my biggest complaint with this game. The only character I felt any remorse for throughout the whole entire story is the daughter of the narrator for having to sit through such an anti-climactic and boring bedtime story. The voice actors all feel like robots, slowly and inhumanly reading through very awkwardly written dialogue they were programmed to read from. Nothing said in this game feels naturally said, and the biggest thing people look for with voice actors is how natural they make the scene feel. Well, I was so negatively impacted by the voice acting at first that I had to turn off the voice volume during my first session of playing through this game because I couldn't handle it. I eventually turned it back on after the stupid frog lady left me alone, and thankfully there wasn't much for dialogue from that point forward so I could handle it.

Although the gameplay was the best part about this game, it also dragged my enjoyment of it down a whole lot. The crystals near the halfway point that refill your grapple are the worst part of all of it because you have to be at a very specific part of the world for each of them to work. I spent at least 10 extra minutes dying to parts where I needed to refill my grapple, where I missed the one specific part I had to do it from, so it wouldn't activate until I came back and tried it again. The physics are also fairly janky to begin with. Some sections feel like pure luck if you get past it because the game decides to fling you in a direction that makes it 50 times harder than it's supposed to be. I started disliking the gameplay so much around an hour and a half in, that I just rushed through the rest of the game as fast as I could in order to stop playing it. Luckily this game is only 2 hours, so I was able to handle it for that small of a time period.

I have never seen character designs as ugly as the characters in this game. I get the people I'm meeting are mutant frog things, but they look so disgusting I wasn't sure if I was playing a N64 game or not while looking at them. Their bodies are fine, but the way everyone's faces are designed is vomit inducing and I had to stop myself from laughing every time I looked at anybody because of how ugly everyone is. Even Fred, a normal human being, has design traits that make him look abhorrent. 

Overall, I really liked this game to start out with, but being subjected to 2 hours of the janky and clearly unfinished gameplay, and the horrific voice acting and story line, makes this one of my least favorite games I have on my Steam library, and I would not recommend it all.
Nice if you like falling into the pits. Movement is bad and story and locations are often boring, I felt it was waste of time for me so I cannot recommend it. Go play Quake Defrag or something.
I somewhat enjoyed this game, it was something I wouldn't have bought myself as I'm not a fan of doing a million jumping puzzles but it wasn't terrible.  The art style is nice and the games cure. The story was interesting but I felt the ending is a bit weird.
Definitely give the game a go if it comes around for free again or if its on sale for super super cheap but I don't recommend it as the type of game I'd pay more than a few dollars for if I didn't get it for free!

You can always check out my playthrough below if you want an idea of the game or just want to see the story!

A boring platforming walking sim.

For a platformer the first thing that is needed is to make it feel good to move around the 3D space and have it control good.
This game does not
Pros:
- Fun parkour mechanics
- Multiple ways to solve most sections
- Very satisfying to pull off a string of great moves

Cons:
- Too short (it took me 2 hours to complete the game, but about 45 minutes of that was on trying to get that damn "Maddie's Challenge" achievement)
- Horrible writing
- Hilariously bad voice acting
- Atrocious 3D graphics for the characters (the rest of the game is fine, but I can't believe how bad the "people" look)

I got this while it was free. I recommend this game for free, as well as for a few bucks. But anything more than $5? Nah. There are plenty more parkour games like this that have better bang for your buck.
A game for those that want to play the same thing over and over and when you fail you go back far enough that you have to work to the point you want to play over and over. The devs rely on checkpoints way before hard parts to make it hard. Unoriginal lack of creativity.
