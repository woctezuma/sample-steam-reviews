[i]Edit (12/2018): This title is still going through some growth and developement. This means that there are nuances of my review below that are slightly innacurate right now. With that being said, the general angle of my review is the exact same. I will revise this review to be more accurate with details after time passes and the game settles a bit. Regardless - at this point in time I'm having more fun than ever with this game.[/i]
---

A lot of talk lately. A lot of talk. [b]So what is [i]Artifact[/i], and what is it not?[/b]
[list]
[*][i]Artifact[/i] takes the business model and structure used by IRL trading card games such as [i]Magic: The Gathering[/i]. This model has you paying for each card or packs of cards - and yes, this is 'pay to win' because obviously if you have more valuable/stronger cards - you will have an advantage if skill is equal. This has caused a great deal of confusion for [i]Artifact[/i], largely (I believe) because of the more recent 'free to play' mobile-ish game design. Some other titles such as [i]HearthStone[/i] allow you to grind for cards instead of paying. There is no grind in [i]Artifact[/i]. All the cards you gain are paid for in some way. For some people, this is a great thing because now we have an economy for cards, therefore your collection has value. This is an important distinction when we compare the microtransactions here, with say, microtransactions that lessen grind. Now this is subjective, but I am happy to report that the cards aren't all that expensive (you can browse the Market to get a feel for prices). The Market fluctuates of course, too. Now of course this isn't some sort of financial investment, nor is it something everyone will love. And that's okay.

[*]For the cards to have monetary value, they always have to cost money (which is why the base game must cost money OR not come with cards or tickets). I don't believe you can have a mixed model that allows grinding for free cards as well as paying. I feel certain that would just wash out all value for the cards. Yes, in [i]HearthStone[/i] you can spend money or grind - but as far as I'm aware - your cards cannot be resold. Again, love it or hate it - this is important for this structure to work. Respectfully, this aspect means this title is not for everyone and results in mixed feelings.

[*]The base game gets you 10 packs of semi-random cards, and 5 entry tickets for tournament play where prizes are involved (prizes consist of card packs and tickets). Five tickets costs about five bucks. With that being said, most of the game is completely free to play. You have a sort of campaign mode that is online multiplayer with prebuilt themed decks. There is a social mode where you can play with friends, complete with setting up custom tournaments and house rules. You can play online with random folks with your custom decks or Phantom Draft - again this is included with the base cost. In my humble opinion, the paid tournaments are a small part of the game, and you can win cards and more tickets if you go that route.
[/list]

[b]This title is quite exciting for folks that are into IRL trading card games and have some disposable income to play around with it.[/b] Unfortunately this will make many people feel very bad that they cannot take part. I completely understand that and feel bad about that. Again, it doesn't take a ton of money, but it takes some - and I know many people with super tight gaming budgets. 

[i]Now about the actual gameplay:[/i]

[b]Pros:[/b]
+This card game is beyond fun and just so slick.
+The tutorial is great and spoon-feeds you nearly everything.
+The whole thing is just so polished. The artwork and voice acting are simply remarkable.
+Lots of QoL options and settings.
+The deckbuilding is great. There are layers of strategy here.
+I love that it creates URL links of your deck that you can share with others.
+Your cards have actual monetary value. Now I don't think Valve will cut you a check, so it only exists on Steam. I doubt this is much of an issue for this playerbase.
+If you are into eSports and tournaments, I think the future is bright for this title.
+Just my opinion, but most cards are cheap right now.

[b]Cons:[/b]
-There is no direct player-to-player trading right now (11/2018). I read that it will likely be added, but yeah, this part feels greedy right now seeing that Valve gets a percentage of all Market transactions. 
-Could use a 1 on 1 Draft mode.
-No player stats yet, but they are still rolling things out it seems.
-Making the cards have actual monetary value comes at a high social cost and is upsetting people. Many people want to be able to grind for cards and it just can't work with this model (or at least as far as I can logic it out). 
-Many argue that IRL when you pay for a card - you get a physical card. Of course you don't here. Not really an issue for me, but it is for some. I also think it's a lot more expensive with IRL cards.
-Missing many Steam features such as Achievements or Trading Cards (11/2018). This is insane.

[b]I'm having a heck of a good time and haven't spent all that much dough, but of course this is subjective.[/b] I recommend it, but you really have to know what this is - and what it isn't.
Valve have taken feedback from launch on board and resolved a bunch of people's top criticisms.

- Lack of progression: Added account XP and skill rating along with weekly bonuses.
- No way to earn cards without spending: Earn packs from leveling up each season.
- Unbalanced or un-fun cards: Regular balance patches.
- No in-game communication with opponent: Added chat-wheel and pre/post game chat.

Unfortunately negative reviewers are unlikely to update their reviews, so don't just Artifact on it's review aggregate. Valve has shown they're willing to change their approach and listen to feedback. This is why I recommend Artifact.
I can sit here and write about how much fun the gameplay is (because its awesome), but it that actually looks like something most reviews agree upon. So instead I think I'm going to address the pricing model, since that seems to be the only controversy.   As a person who has well over 5k Hearthstone ranked wins, and spent hundreds of dollars, I just do not understand all the "credit card best card" comments. It is true that there is ONE CARD that costs $15, but that's literally the only one. There is one other card that costs $10 as well, but you absolutely do not need these cards and almost  all of the cards are around .10-.30. If you went and bought every card on the market except the literal only 2 expensive cards itd maybe cost you an extra $15-20. Thats EVERY SINGLE CARD. Do you really belive if you bought 10 hearthstone packs that you would get that value? You have to open 20 packs just to get one random legendary in Hearthstone, not to mention if you wanted to get dust enough to craft one. With the avg pack being 40 dust you would need 40 packs to craft a legendary of your choice. 

Thats the crazy part, while in Hearthstone your deck usually revolves around the legendaries, in this game it revolves around your heroes. If you wanted to build a Hearthstone deck with 3 distinct legendaries chances are even if you open 60 packs you will not get the three legendaries you desire AND on top that you sure as hell wont have enough dust for them either. Yet  literally today I bought a green hero I wanted for .48. That means I not only get the hero, but also every hero comes with 3 copies of their special card. Then I went and bought like 5 more cards for $1 TOTAL. That brought my entire total to $1.48. So now lets do some comparison, in Hearthstone that wouldn't even be enough to buy one pack, but even if it was that would be 5 random cards. So now I basically just bought 9 cards one of which was a legendary for LESS THAN ONE HEARTHSTONE PACK. And on top of that I got to choose each card individually! So, yes the game does require an initial cost of $20, and yes there is no free way to grind packs, but holy crap the exxagerations on the pricing of cards in these reviews are out of control. People all pointing to the one card that cost $15, while ignoring the fact that all the rest combined barely equal that price. 


As far as I'm concerned the pricing model of this card game is one ofthe BEST features and certaintly not a detractor. So yes the game costs $20 upfront and yes, you will probably have to pay a couple more bucks after that to get some good cards, but please do not believe the reviews out there trying to make it seem like you'll have to pay $15 for every card, thats just absolutely false.
TL;DR If paying for anything after buying a game is on your list of no-gos, then you shouldn't buy this game. If you're expecting a CCG experience including buying booster packs and competitive runs then you may find a complex, fun game here.

Very fun game, more similar to Magic: The Gathering than Hearthstone. Gameplay is very much easy to learn, difficult to master. Tutorials show you the basics, but you're expected to learn the nuances of the game by playing, experiencing and of course losing until you get better.

ECONOMY
A lot of reviews are focusing negatively on the economy. To be clear, if you expect to buy the game and have that be the only money you spend, you will have a negative experience. But if you go into the game hoping for a similar experience to card collecting that a physical card game provides (occasionally buying booster packs, some cards being extremely common while others are rare, buying and selling cards in your collection) with a few welcome differences (so far no single card or cards that are insanely expensive, so far most expensive cards are ~$25-$30, draft/competitive runs that charge a small fee and include prizes for win streaks) than you may enjoy this. Even without paying, you can do social/casual drafts and experience all of the cards available in the game. I'm curious to see how it pans out in the long run, but so far I seem to prefer this experience over "free-to-play" economies like Hearthstone. 

Overall, I can see how people who might expect to buy the game and own the entire experience without planning to pay anything more would be disappointed and angry. But if you go into this feeling excited about the idea of gradually learning the game, building your collection and expecting to drop some money once in a while for competitive runs or booster packs, then you may find something you enjoy.
With the new patch, Valve have addressed virtually every major complaint towards the game:

You can now earn packs and tickets

Balance changes

A progression & ranking system

If you were on the fence about Artifact due to the lack of those features, now would be a great time to pick it up.
Okay so I want to MEH this game so hard. It makes me so confused when I think about it!

I love this game a ton and it's the second TCG I've been wanting to add to the fold for months. I play Magic like mad and I've wanted to jump into something new and complex and Artifact is EXACTLY that.

This game is ridiculously fun but not being able to win cards in any fashion other than by paying isn't all that cool. As a Magic: The Gathering fan I understand that that's how tabletop games are played (that if you want new cards you HAVE to buy them, even events require a buy-in!) and so Valve is imitating this practice here, but it simply doesn't translate into the digital sphere. There has to be a way to make progress. 

Valve, all you have to do is imitate MTGArena's system. Allow us to win in-game currency. Then institute a system for spending the in-game currency for small packs of 3 cards rather than 10. Or allow us to simply win random singles. Singles would satisfy SO much of this games problems.

I will likely continue to play this game for better or for worse but something has to be done. Until then, I can't recommend because goodness you'll find yourself spending a lot simply to buy cards that are worth while and viable for Constructed Events to win more cards.

Of course, I also DO recommend this game...? I mean, it's a far cheaper alternative to Magic: The Gathering! But if you want to play with randy's they're probably running high-end decks as opposed to your friends who are running jank.

Man, this game really IS confusing, and it has NOTHING to do with the mechanics!
ECONOMIC MODEL:
For a base 20 USD price, you get:

UNLIMITED: 
1. Draft mode (where p2w is impossible, you select a whole set of new cards based on randomly generated cards) (*)
2. Gaunlet (player uses Valve pre-constructed deck to play against one another)
3. Play against AI, where you are limited by the cards you actually own
4. Play against friends

Hint: Sell all your cards away if you only care about above modes, cash your cards back into steam cash to purchase the things you actually care (If you get certain rare heroes from opening packs, you actually get more than 20 USD bacK)

There is also pay to play mode: Expert mode, which cost tickets and packs to enter, allow you to win rewards.

1. Constructed Expert (Where P2W is actually a thing if you do own a set of meta cards)
2. Draft mode (5 win before you lose 2, 3 will net you back your ticket, 4 will grants you 1 pack with 2 usd worth, 5 will grant you 2 packs with 4 usd worth).

(*) It's not exactly random generated per say. You open 5 packs, except for first set of a cards in a pack, the next sets are left over when cards being picked by other players.
--
Hint:
1. Buy all cards worth less than 5 cent on Steam market, convert 20 of them to get 1 ticket. Which is cheaper than buying directly 1 ticket
2. Any cards net you less than 5 cent when selling -> toss them into recycle to get 1 ticket
3. Best way to learn is copy enemies's deck when ever you lose in Constructed mode, it gives you much faster learning curve and cards.
4. Press F2 and F3 during a match, it tracks cards that  you have played
[h1]A Deep and Strategic Card Game[/h1]

+ The gameplay is both easy to learn but hard to master.  If you want a heavily strategic card game, artifact will test your wits for many hours.
+ Various playstyles. There are currently 4 colored decks which you can mix together. Each color behaves differently. Example: Red cards are more offensive/strong,  Green cards are more defensive and buff your allies, black cards have many support abilities, etc.
+ Visually pleasing
+ Expert play is incredibly addicting once you get into it.  Not only is it very competitive, but you have to pay $1-2 as an entry fee in "tickets". Lose 2 games and you lose the gauntlet. Win 3 or more and you win a prize (tickets / packs of cards)  In theory if you master the game you can make profit winning packs and selling cards.
+ Large variety of cards each with their own unique stats, abilities, and uses.
+ Being able ot buy and sell cards on the marketplace is very appealing personally. You are able to build strong decks at a very low cost, and can easily pick up whatever cards you may be missing. 
+ Draft mode, which lets you pick random cards to build a deck and play with. This mode does NOT require you to own any cards and evens out the "pay-to-win" nature of the game.
+ As previously mentioned since you don't need cards to play, you can sell all the cards you get from the $20 "starter pack" (10 packs of cards, 5 tickets, 2 decks), and get ~50%+ of your money back from purchasing the game.


- Overwhelming...  Some games can last up to an hour, and generally speaking the game is designed so that each game is incredibly close. Being somewhat RNG dependent can cause 1 wrong move to cost you the game.
- Balancing Issues,  some heroes / cards are definitely better than others.  if playing competitively and you don't happen to own Axe, Drow Ranger, Blink Daggers, or other specific cards you will be at a disadvantage. (Expect to spend ~$10+ building a deck)
- Microtransactions...    This game is designed like a Free to Play game. You must buy tickets ($1 each) to play competitively. You buy packs of cards ($2) each.  You buy cards off the marketplace.
- No trading...    Seriously what the fuck...its a trading card game but you literally can NOT trade cards. You can only sell them on the market.

~ Currently there's no progression system, so if you are a casual player theres no real sense of reward.

[b]Overall:[/b] Artifact is designed for competitive card players who enjoy a deep level of strategy.

I've always been a real card game nerd. I have played over thousands of hours in online TCG's like: MTG: Duels of the Planeswalkers/Arena, Duelyst, Infinity Wars, Fearia, Gwent and Shadowverse. In this review I will compare Artifact to my experience with the other titles on the market and see where it excels and falls short. 

[h1]Conclusion/TL;DR:[/h1]
Artifact is a beautiful and innovative card game. The lane, hero, gold and shop systems add a refreshing depth and dynamic make it really stand out from all the other card games on the market.  Some aspects of the gameplay could be improved by adding more complex (multicolored) cards and effects. Having to wait way too long for your opponent turn can be extremely frustrating, but could be improved by reducing turn times. 

I'm still divided on Artifact's monetization model. Being able to trade cards with players on the community market is a big plus, but making people pay for the initial game with pay4progression is not. ""Free"" to play players should be offered some form of obtaining new cards without having to pay (more) money.

I'm giving it a postivie review. Deckbuilding and gameplay outweigh the rough edges. Monetization still remains a real concern. We will have to see how it all plays out with new expansions already announced. Right now it seems reasonable compared to other TCG's on the market the competitors.

[h1]In depth:[/h1]

[b]The Positive:[/b]
+ Vibrant and beautiful Valve-style design. The UI, game board and effect look great. The awesome audio and voice acting make an immersive experience. 
+ Stabile engine. Running perfectly smooth for me. 
+ Heroes add a complex new layer. Adding heroes on top of creatures and spells adds many possibilities in deck building. Managing your heroes within the lanes is an essential aspect to win. 
+ The three lane-system offers an interesting mix between the focus on the individual lanes and keeping an eye on the entire board. 
+ RNG just done right! Enough to keep the game fresh, but not made boring and annoying as in some of other titles. (h**rtst*ne ;p)
+ Cool to play with your favorite heroes from the DOTA universe and seeing their abilities and play style being successfully translated into a card game. 
+ Ability to buy and sell cards. I'm aware this is a controversial issue. Card trading is an essential part of any real TCG. I HATE the economy in most of the other games. Those offer a locked collection in which you cant trade with other players. Instead, you are dependent on a constant grind for meme-points to buy boosters. To actually get the cards you want, you have to grind even more by 'milling/transmuting' cards (that are then also destroyed and you cant play with anymore). This systems is purely designed to be a time and money sink. And even if you invest real cash... you are usually not gonna get the cards you want. I'd rather have Artifact compared to that.  Now i can just buy or trade what I want directly. 
+ Free casual draft mode in which you can draft and play, buy not have to buy a ticket. 

[b]The Meh:[/b]
= The color of cards and how multicolored decks work. Some cards and effects are too bland and basic and dont mix well. Like in magic, I want more multicolored cards or heroes that make  your deck unique and interesting. I really hope to see more interesting options in deck building in coming expansions. 
= Rewards for winning drafts are meh. 3 wins = tickets back, 4 adds a booster and 5 another one. Feels very unrewarding, when you can also play casual draft for free. 
= WAITING is an issue. I HATE waiting for an AFK-opponent. The turn timer and game timer are too lenient for all the actions you have to take.  In most games I'm 2x 3x faster than my opponent, because I'm actually sitting at my computer focusing on the game while (s)he is doing god knows what. When you need to work through three entire lanes with multiple actions, you don't want to have to wait at every single step. 

[b]The Bad:[/b] 
- Game should've been free to play. The initial price tag is completely unjustified. Either make the game free to play with micro transactions or sell the game at a price and give people all the content. Dont make people pay for the game and then also for the content. You used to be fucking above this Valve....
- Progression. I like the economy and being able to trade cards. That being said: I feel there should be some progression for free to play players. Now, If you dont pay, you dont progress. That's also not fun.
buy the game -> open 10 card pack -> sell all rare card -> get money back or half money back (based on  your luck in opening 10 card pack) -> enjoy call to arm and phantom draft (two mode where you don't need your own card/deck), without spent more money you still can have fun at this two mode and bot match mode. and enjoy one month dota plus for dota player as a bonus

*you also get 5 free ticket to play in expert mode to try earn free card pack

update :
free card pack and ticket when level up. worth it
Dont let the mixed reviews fool you. Artifact proves to be fun, engaging, rewarding, and overall a fantastic experience. I cant recommend it enough. 

If you want a card/strategy game. Looking to just sort of chill, have fun, Think a bit. Ive enjoyed other card games, but couldnt really get into them. This game pulls off what the others couldnt and I'm really enjoying it.  

---THE BAD---
You WILL be spending more than $20. It is not however, an expensive game, you just need to understand what artifact aims to be. Also, Ive got some advice to make the game cheap(er) than some may lead you to believe. (we are talking less than $60 total)  

-Understand that artifact aims to be similar to REAL card games. What you are buying is a starter pack of cards. $20 gives you 120+ cards.  This guarantees 10 Hero's and a good number of rares.  Plenty of deck building fun right off the bat. enough to play and understand what you like or dont.  
You also recieve 5 tickets. These grant you access to a competitive tournament style of game. AGAIN, this is no different than if you wanted to go play in a board/card game tournament anywhere else. Not only do you win your tickets back, but you also earn more cards. Save those 5 tickets until you have a good deck/feel for the game and you may never need to buy more.  

-Speaking of tickets. A pack of 5 cost $4.99 + tax ($5.45 for me) OR 20 cards. Cheap cards cost as little as $0.05 WITHOUT tax so $5. DONT BUY TICKETS.  As you win tournaments you get cards, so you can use those cards for tickets too.

-CARDS. As I mentioned, many cards cost $0.05  probably 75% cost under $0.20.  a card pack of 12 cost $1.99+tax. So, if you buy all the cards around $0.17 and below it is cheaper than packs and you have more than half the carrds in the game for like $15. From there you can spend $15 on packs and maybe another $10 just on cards you dont have and.... you have almost every card in the game for under $60 which is what most full games cost anyways. Recycle your duplicates and you have a handful of tickets.  Use those tickets to earn the rest of your cards.  Or be the paying, working, adult that you are and buy cards/packs as you want them.  

---THE GOOD---
Not like the bad is all that bad...but that seems what people are stuck on with these reviews. I felt it important for everyone to understand.  

-GAMEMODES: 
CONSTRUCTED: Custom deck, one match OR Tournament style. 5 matches with your deck. The deck cant be changed for those 5 matches. 
DRAFT: 60 cards from 5 packs. You can change your deck each round with those cards. 

     BOTS:  Try your decks against bots. Make decks for the bots to use too! AI seems solid, challenging and provides stress free fun. Play w/ or w/o timer.  Constructed mode only. Single match.

     SOCIAL: This makes it easy to play with people on your friends list or in your steam groups. You can even create or join FREE tournaments that you, your friends, or group members make. Play how you want, with whomever you want.  

     CASUAL:  This is online mode, matchmaking. All game modes are available here as well. Free.

     EXPERT:  
          Constructed 5 match (1 ticket): 
               3 wins = 1 ticket
               4 wins = 1 ticket + 1 Pack
               5 wins = 1 ticket + 2 Packs   
          Phantom Draft (1 ticket):
               3 wins = 1 ticket
               4 wins = 1 ticket + 1 Pack
               5 wins = 1 ticket + 2 Packs 
         Keeper Draft (2 tickets 5 packs)
               3 wins = 2 ticket + 60 drafted cards
               4 wins = 2 ticket + 2 Packs + 60 drafted cards
               5 wins = 2 ticket + 3 Packs + 60 drafted cards  

CARD VARIETY
     Cards do many things and support many styles of play. Focus on strong hero builds items, maybe spell casting, amass an army, build a wall, win with gold, debuffs, lock out the other player from using cards, be an assasin, and so much more. There is enough variety that is viable and fun, that you should have a blast if you like creating decks.  

     4 colors: red, green, blue, Black. each has its own hero, spell and improvement cards. Red hero plays red cards, black plays black etc. No hero in a lane? Cant play color cards.  

DECK BUILDING
Easy and intuitive interface. A must have for the genre, very solid. Lots of easy ways to sort and find what you want.  You will spend a lot of time here not because you have to but because you will want to. It is very easy to make a deck, then go try it out and perfect it to your liking.  

GAMEPLAY
Its deep! there is a lot to learn and master, but the game is VERY good at telling you what you CAN do. What makes a good player and a bad one is knowing how that plays out and predicting your next moves with an opponent. Its not a question of how do I play, but rather what should I play.  VERY easy to learn, much harder to master, and of course learn what cards you like or not and adjusting decks.  

Pacing is perfect. And I've had a bunch of matches where im on the edge of my seat just excitied to see how things play out and if I will come out on top. So many very close very intense matches. 

The game is simply fun. If you are even looking at the game or thinking about if its something you would like, chances are you will not be dissapointed. I bought the game skeptical and am very glad I did. Wonderful game.
*First 5 paragraphs talk about the marketplace system and value vs other CCG*

Ok, ignore the reviews complaining about the marketplace system, this system is absolutely amazing!!! So I paid 20$ for the game, but you actually get 10 packs x 2$ (looks like 5packs now ) each plus a couple starter decks (not sure if a free player would get this) and then  5 event tickets, so basically 5 free drafts for chance to get more packs, not a bad deal.

I didn't get a ton of great items from my 10 packs, but it was decent. Now here is why the marketplace is AMAZING. I wen't thru and purchased over 50 cards, mostly 1 of each I did not own of every single uncommon card I did not own (they are basic, common, uncommon & rare) along with a few commons I was also missing. Oh no, that has to cost a lot right, I mean people are crying about this system, lol... It cost me less than 4$

Then I go and do the same thing with the rare cards (the highest quality in the game, aka legendaries). I did not purchase every single one, I read them and only grabbed the ones that looked pretty good, but it was the majority of them. I just did one copy again and also purchased some rare Hero cards (tend to be the most expensive). So another 50+ cards of the highest tier and it was like 17$. The grand total now is 21$ for over 100 rare cards and the initial 10 packs, but honestly you would be better off not to buy a single pack and do what I did. I received maybe like 1 rare and 1 (maybe 2) uncommons per pack that would cost a new player 2$ each. Based on my experience with the market, I imagine you could buy the cards equal to what I got in 10 packs for under 10$, maybe 12 or 13$ max.. It's mostly cheap cards that sell for a few cents. 

The most expensive card sells for 18$ and the next highest one is 12$, but prices fluctuate, right now that 18$ card is 16.30, followed by 11.08, 7.18, a couple 4s then a couple 3s, then like 10 cards between 1-2$ and another 10 cards between 0.50$ and 1$.

When I played HS years ago, the initial cost of the DLC (long before they swapped modes and only use more recent cards in ranked) and enough packs to get a semi ok deck going was pushing 100$. I played that game for a couple years, didn't spend a ton, but a good 50-80$ when new packs came out and I was still missing tons of big impact cards. To be able to spend 30-40$ and have at least 1 copy of almost every card on day 1 is very cost effective, so much to the point that I don't see why people would waste time buying packs and it's going to force valve to remake this system.

The Elder Scrolls Legends was another one I played a lot and that game is much cheaper to build a collection than HS. Even in TESL you would need to buy the expansions which are 10-20$ each and then twice they released card pack expansions which require a purchase of 70$ to get enough of the important cards to make you happy and on top of that you need to have been playing for a while to have enough mats to craft what you don't get on that 70$ purchase of cards. I  basically have a full collection, multiple copies of everything in that game, but I played at a high level for well over a year and spent roughly 200$ on it. 

GENERAL GAMEPLAY

So far only played a few online matches, went 4-1 so if you are experienced in these type of games you should be able to jump right in, but I did have to practice against bots for about 5 matches. It uses a 3 lane / board system, but the downside is that matches can take a while, anywhere from 20-40 minutes and it sucks if you lose a match you could have won after 40 minutes. Each board has a tower with 40hp, destroy 2 of 3 to win, after one destroys it comes back with 80hp, you could also destroy the same one twice to win.

The potential is great because it means you should see less rush / face decks like you see in a lot of other card games. I personally can't stand those type of decks because I feel they lack skill and are basically coin flip decks. If enemy has counter early or you don't win by turn X, you almost surely will lose. Those are not balanced styles which really show off the complex gameplay of a CCG. 

I have always been drawn to Tempo / Control playstyles, but pretty much anything other than face rushing. It's such an amazing feeling when you make several efficient plays and now have 6 cards in hand vs 2 and you also have board control. Let's say a rush deck takes 25 minutes to win, a more complex deck takes 32, but also plays much more consistently with a greater chance to win, I think you will see more of the latter due to the initial investment of time. It wouldn't make sense to gamble so much when it's going to already take 20+ minutes, you might as well focus on something more complex which I'm hoping is going to lead to some really amazing matches.

MECHANICS

A huge pro for me is the "mana" system. You start with 3, so you can play 3 cost card from turn 1 and gain +1 per turn plus some cards will add to it like any other games. When I saw who was involved in making this I was worried it would be another CCG where we have to draw our mana. You also gain money from defeating creatures, heroes or towers which you can use to buy cards from the item part of the deck which are mostly buffs, +x armor, hp, attk, etc...

Let's say I go first on board 1 and decide to play my unit, then other player drops a unit and I end turn. Now it goes back to the other player he might play a weapon on his unit, then it comes back to me again even though I end my turn, let's say I end again, but now it goes back to him again and they can keep adding more and more, but I can also decide at the last second to add something as well. I think this system would be a little better if you could lock in and the other player can only go X amount of times before the turn ends as long as you don't do anything else. Maybe it max out at 2-3 times for the second player to then keep playing. I don't know, maybe this will grow on me as I play more.


A huge negative is how the Hero and auto creep cards are played. Each turn random cards are playing with the same stats on both sides. You pick what lane to put the hero, but you have 0 control on where to place any cards. Once the turn starts you can choose where to put your normal minion cards, but too often things can be decided by where the computer randomly places the other cards. You could have an amazing Hero that randomly gets put into a horrible spot you would never play him in and he instantly dies. We need some sort of control over where units will go even if it's some type of auto system where units will always place on the far right / left and go from there, this way you have at least some control over where they land.

Where a creature will attack is also completely random which is really bad imo. Now part of this mechanic is fine like if a creature is in front of another creature it attacks that creature, if nothing is there it hits the tower. Some creatures gain cleave which can hit both sides for less dmg, ok this is all good so far, but then this happens. 

You have your card and enemy card head to head with nobody on either side. You play a card to the right side and there is a 25% chance (still not sure if this is random each turn or decided on the play, think it's decided on the initial play) that the card will gain the ability to attack to the side to do less dmg and help kill the enemy card, but it might just attack straight, it's 100% random. 

Maybe this won't be a huge deal as I play more, but I am really against adding more RNG when you don't need to. Just make certain cards always be able to hit the sides or not, add something that tells us for sure because it sucks you are forced to constantly gamble on something like this. Maybe the enemy needs 2 dmg to die, well it's random if u can hit him or not. Last main issue is that there is no ranked ladder, this will be key issue that drops playerbase.
THE GAME IS FUN but there are MANY THINGS THAT CAN BE FIXED

Hear me out, sorry for the rage.  The idea and game play is really up to preference but the way they managed the ecosystem of the cards is really really bad. 

1) It is modeled after a free to play model

Facts:
- Your cards are not worth the same value after you open it
         - After opening your cards the only worth is for you to turn 20 cards in to create a ticket
         - What is a ticket? you might ask? it is a gambling chance to get a pack
         - In Hearthstone or Shadowverse, the cards are directly marked down to 1/4 their market value
                    - However, this is done for a number of reasons:
                            1) The game is FREE TO PLAY
                            2) There is no trading
                            3) You can EARN packs
         - So the game is made in such a way where trading with your friends is required to make the best use of your pack opening and you are supposed to sell your extra cards for cash. WHICH brings me to the NEXT reason

2) it is linked to the STEAM MARKET
- THIS IS EXTREMELY BAD!!! Why you may ask? we get cash instead of dust back which we can then use for packs?!
- Firstly it is on the OPEN STEAM MARKET and not just the players of ARTIFACT. 
        - This inturn leads to a number of issues
                          1) Price flipping!! People who are not invested in the game are just increasing the price needed to let's not 
                              say compete professionally but to even ENJOY the game
                          2) Pay to Win no real need for explaination This will lower the new comer's fun of the game on an even 
                               greater level than Hearthstone or Shadowverse. Including the fact that the game is not free to play and 
                               that there are price flippers, the entry fee not just 20 USD but maybe in the hundreds range
                          3) But isn't that the same for MAGIC or any PHYSICAL card game? You might add. In my defence, the 
                               steam market is WAY too open for this game. In the real world if a person comes to you to purchase a 
                               rare card, you will be able to tell 3 things if he is a price flipper, a collector or a player. In the steam 
                               market it is all handled by algorythms and the cash is just flowing outside the game and also in to 
                               steam. 
                          4) STEAM MARKET TAKES A CUT OF THE SALES 


In other words ARTIFACT is a VERY lucrative business
They get money from MANY places and by they I mean STEAM. 
They do not protect the ARTIFACT community.

Places they get money from:
1) initial purchase
2) packs
3) tickets
4) SALE BETWEEN PLAYERS (which also includes FLIPPERS which allows them to earn more MONEY)

Things they can do to help protect players:
Close the ARTIFACT MARKET: 
DO NOT LET PEOPLE WHO DO NOT OWN THE GAME PURCHASE OR SELL CARDS
but Mr you might add why won't these flippers jsut purchase an ARTIFACT game to do so?
There you just answered your question most flippers will not do so unless the returns outweigh the risk.

GIVE A PACK STRAIGHT FOR THE EXCHAGING OF CARDS 
or 
HAVE A DUST SYSTEM BUT INSTEAD GIVE STEAM WALLET CASH straight (85%) of market rate or something
or
GIVE A PACK FOR 0-2 wins but only allow unlimited for the 3 and above winners.
I wasn't going to post my review so early but since this game is getting review bombed I decided to write my (positive) opinion.

I used to dislike card games and never found them fun so I was not interested in Artifact at first but because Valve made my favourite game series like Half Life, Counter Strike and games where I spent 1000 hours like CSGO and TF2, I decided to give it a try. I was avoiding any information about Artifact because the community seemed to be too toxic. Two days ago I jumped into Artifact completely blind and had no idea what to expect from it.

After going through a nice tutorial I learned the basics of the game. It's basically Dota 2 played via cards - three lanes, three towers. The game ends when either 2 towers or the ancient of a player are destroyed. It's easy to learn but hard to master, requires strategy... and cards of course. This is the interesting part - players can buy better cards using Steam community market so this game could be called "pay to win". I'm not 100% ok with this business model. But on the other side, it's a card game. And the most expensive card costs "only" about 19€ right now while the rest of the cards are in the 0.04 - 2€ zone (this information can change anytime due to market prices).

So what does this mean? In real world when it comes to complex card games you also need good cards. And making a collection of cards is a part of the fun. Besides that, it's not always about the best cards. You actually need to think about strategy, use your brain and make a good deck based on a strategy and tactic that you invented by yourself, find what suits you.
Right now it costs a few hundreds of € to buy all cards. This is wrong. But in reality not everyone can afford this. Not everyone can buy all the cards. And not everyone with all cards knows how to use them in the right way. At the end of the day I can definitely imagine the majority of people spending the same average amount of money on cards so it will just lead to mostly balanced games anyway.

This is about individual preference but I'm ok with this. Or in other words - I think the fun the game offers cannot be ruined by this business model so easily.

Back to the game itself - I miss some social interactions with the other side - there seems to be no chat (T does not work) or any way to add the oponent to my friend list, it's a pity. Also, I'd like to see a 2v2 vs 3v3 mode where players would be fighting in teams and being able to quickly check how their allies are playing.
This game is fun, it's the first card game I ever had fun with and I believe it needs a year or two to explode and become one of the most played Steam games.

Also, this game runs natively on Linux with Vulkan and top-notch official support unlike D3D-only Heartstone - thanks for treating penguins as first class citizens Valve!
The reaction of people regarding the monitization of this game is extremely silly to me, especially when they try to somehow compare Artifact to Hearthstone in an attempt to argue that Hearthstone's monetization system is somehow superior to Artifact's.  In this game, I can put together a deck and, if I don't happen to have one or two cards I need to complete it, I can actually specifically pick those cards up.  I don't have to continually open pack after pack hoping for a particular uncommon, or destroy 25 common duplicates just so I can make a single rare card, I can just buy a playset of most cards for literal cents.  While there are a few cards that are rare and desirable, which predictably drives the price up, most of the cards cost literally pennies.  Also, the most expensive cards (As of now, Axe is hovering around $28-30 and is, by far, the most expensive.  However, as a hero, you only need one copy ever) aren't necessarily required, just very powerful.

There is also a ton of game here that doesn't require a constant infusion of money.  Phantom draft is free and draws upon all the cards.  The social modes allow for single matches or even entire tournaments with various options for enforced card restrictions (commons/uncommons, pauper, monocolor, etc.), as well as the option to do draft (again, with the entire card pool, regardless of what cards you or your opponent personally own), and pre-contructed decks with a competitive gauntlet.

Progression has already been acknowledged as their top priority after release, so the progression system is coming.  With it, it's safe to assume there may be actual rewards that would allow the people who'd rather grind out cards to do so.  However, until then, the monitization system, as it stands now, is still the most direct and easy system to assemble meta decks out of any of the other digital CCGs.

The game itself offers some of the best production values I've ever seen in a digital CCG.  The music, the sound production, every card has fully voice acted flavor text, the board is beautiful (though I am looking forward to alternate boards, which is inevitable), and the imps are wonderfully animated with plenty of contextual reactions to the changing gamestate.

The actual game itself is probably one of the best CCGs I've ever played.  Yes, there is RNG in this game: the initial placement of heroes/creeps, creep placement in subseqent rounds, and attack targets for creeps/heroes are all initially determined randomly.  However, the game gives you multiple cards and deck building options to mitigate and manipulate these boardstates.  While I would typically agree the less RNG the better, the random nature of the unit placement/attacking gives another layer to the strategy and tactical crunch of this game.  This game is primarily a game about resource allocation and flexibilty in the face of seemingly unwinnable situations; knowing when you can and should double-down, and when you need to hedge your bets or just completely abandon a lane.  The capacity for mindgames and misdirection in this game is immense, and is one of the reasons I've really enjoyed the time I've played this.

Bottom line: If you are someone used to MTG and the way the secondary market works there, there's nothing particularly surprising about Artifact's system.  If you're someone used to Hearthstone's system, maybe just do the initial buy-in and play the free stuff until progression comes along.  Either way, the game itself is fantastic and, if you can get past the fact that this digital game's economy functions like a physical CCG, you'll have a lot of fun with it.
Cost: -17,95€

Rewards:
i get bad luck and i can sell all the cards for +12,96 €


so for 5 € i can play the best draft game mode for free forever. 
Also i get 5 Tickets worth of 4,5€, so the total cost of the game for me is 0,5 € !!!!!
----------------------------------------------------

Constructed is expensive, but Draft is the best gameplay i never seen in any card game and is totally FREE doesnt matter you dont have any card and is free to play.

Buy and play free Draft forever, the best game of any card game.
The complexity of Android Netrunner, the addictiveness of Magic The Gathering, the lore of Dota. It still needs a lot of Valve polish to make it head and shoulders above any other card game, but as the opening states, this is only the beginning. 

What is here at launch is big: 
- Free phantom draft against the world
- Free Preconstructed Deck Gauntlet for launch
- Ability to share decks with friends
- Ability to make tournaments of various styles (Pauper, Phantom Draft, Constructed, with multiple modes)
- Competitive Gauntlet for prizes ($1 USD each run)
- The most polished visuals in a card game, with every card having a stupid amount of voicelines and banter to throw at each other. 

Things to watch out for:
- LCG fans beware, this is a TCG. Packs are very friendly with no rarities above "Rare" and a good chance to get multiple rares in your pack, but the initial entry fee is NOT the final fee. You will need to spend an additional $20-50~ to make a tier 1 competitive deck if you wish to play constructed. 
- Progression/Stats/Rankings are being implemented after release and are "high priority". Right now, it's just the game itself and no community interaction. There's not even a chatwheel or way to say GG or GLHF. 
- Zero cosmetics at launch and no word on how that side will be handled or how much they could cost. If you're wanting to be fancy, it may cost a lot.
- While there is a big promise of esports content, this is subject to how people other than Valve run it. A completely new game is having to grow the community from the ground up. 
- Artifact will have future sets. There is no word on how often they will be and you will need to update your deck for constructed using Steam Marketplace. 

If you're a TCG, CCG or LCG player that's wanting something meaty and complex with a proven developer, this may be the game for you.
Game it self is fun and well polished, as to expect from a Valve game.
Most noticeably the gameplay feels very refreshing and original.

BUT...
No sense of progression or any kind of reward for more casual player like me.
If you do want to feel rewarded you need to pay, but be risking trowing money out of the window.
Valve did a great job on this game, they sure learnt a lot from MTG
The RNG is just about right to keep each game different and fun, but will rarely be the key factor of a win/loss
Currently, the game is in a closed beta state, and have some features missing (would be great to be able to see your MMR)
But it does look like a finished game already, beautiful, competitive, polished and FAIR!!
It is a Pay to Play game, but not a Pay to Win game, meaning that you can not spend thousands of dollars to have better win rate over people who spent a bit less. That said, you do need to spend at least a few hundred dollars to complete your collection if you really want to be playing in a competitive constructed level

BTW I'm going to bring the TI title to my country (BRAZIL)! So if you are looking at this game thinking you can put your hands in the million dollar prize pool, forget it! It already have an owner, ME! <3
Over 60 hours in now so I felt compelled to leave a review. Having played CCGs competitively for over 20 years, I have seen a lot of different game styles and mechanics, and despite this, I was pleasantly surprised by how refreshing and strategically deep this game is. The unique take on the simultaneous turn system offers a lot of interactivity while not being overly complex to figure out. The level of balance between randomness (ie variance) and skill feels very good to me. So far I have only played draft, and only now do I feel I've mostly figured it out, but still yet I learn something new each day I play. Given the small pool of cards on initial release, and the depth it offers, I expect this game to hold it's own for years to come and never get dull in the foreseeable future. Richard Garfield the master has added yet another notch to his legacy.

Pros: 

1) Cost is inexpensive. 20 bucks for the game and you can slowly build up cards through playing phantom drafts. Or, if you just want to buy cards, they are around a few pennies to a few bucks each, the most expensive as of right now being 20 bucks. And you can buy and sell cards, and trade cards, so once you have a decent collection you can cycle through them for other cards and spend very little money to do so.

2) Fun! Multiple strategic paths are possible and it's never purely clear cut. Or if it is, it takes an extraordinary level of competence to know 'the best play' which would take more hours to achieve than most people have.

3) You can set up tournaments at will with your friends any time at no cost. You can play against bot AI any time at no cost. Fantastic!

4) Beautiful to look at. From start to end, the graphics and sound are top notch, animations are fluid, the cards talk to each other. Just stunning.

Cons:

1) Learning curve to be 'very good' at the game is quite high, though to be 'decent enough' to have fun and play doesn't take much. A lot of things are going on and it's a lot to take in at first. I personally have no issue with this, in fact the challenge invigorates me, but I can see how for some people it would be overwhelming.

2) Tough to appeal as a spectator game to the general public. If you have never played, watching someone play just won't make a lot of sense, and you won't understand who is winning or losing, let alone why they are doing certain things for the most part.

3) Stale constructed meta (allegedly). This will likely change when more cards are released, and this is what I've heard from people who have played longer than I, not my own opinion since I have not played constructed yet.

4) No signals in draft. Since the card draft mode uses a global player pool, there is no way to know what colors are open or what signals are being sent or who is passing to you, so you just have to go with strategies that involve 'good' cards in a generic sense, that you can cast. This method feels robotic and more shallow in terms of strategic depth than it could be to me. Also, even in a private friends only tournament there is no passing of cards between each other, which would have been a lot of fun if that was how it worked.

5) No mulligan. Opening draws being inflexible makes getting 'curved out' on by an opponent due to RNG feel particularly lame. Most CCGs do have a variance off-setting mechanism via a mulligan. I feel this should exist here too.

6) Invisible match maker ratings system. There is no way to know where you stand in terms of rank or what pool of players you are being paired against, despite the fact they admitted there is a MMR system in place.

Over all though, this game is fantastic, and I would highly recommend it for any serious or casual card game player. I already think it's just a better game than hearthstone, and it is giving MTG a run for it's money.
What a refreshing twist on the Magic The Gathering and Hearthstone systems.

[h1]What does this game play like?[/h1]
     In Artifact, you battle for control of three lanes, much like the game DOTA 2 that the game's heros/creatures come from. Its like playing three games of magic/hearthstone at once. Like Hearthstone, you gain 1 permanent mana at each of these lane's towers each turn. This is renewed at each turn. You can spend this mana on spells that match the color of your hero that is deployed at each lane. You get random creatures that spawn in each round for yours and the opponents three lanes. 

    After an opponent plays a card, you get to play a card. This goes back and forth until both pass their action. After this, your creatures attack whatever is directly ahead of them on the table. If a tougher creature is not going to be killed by one of your creatures, its neighbor ally will join in on the fight to ensure it dies. Finally, heros that are killed in combat or are late arrivals ( you get more heros on rounds 2 and so on), you can choose where they go to support a lane or ensure victory at an opponent's weakened tower. Heros can be equipped with items you buy with gold you get from killing heros or creeps ( creatures). This makes Heros an escalating threat throughout the game.

     Anything that is not blocked deals damage to that lane's tower. If you lose a tower, that tower reveals an ancient with 80 health, four times the amount of a tower. If you lose two lane's towers, you lose the game. If you lose an ancient, you lose the game.

[h1]What does this game do right?[/h1]
Artifact gets it right when it comes to pacing, deck building, and surprisingly, getting the cards you want.

[list]
[*] [b]Pacing - [/b] Artifact's pacing compared to Magic is much better because of the victory condition of losing two towers or one ancient. In Magic, 20 life goes by very quickly unless the game stalemates due to bad draws. Artifact's adaptation of Hearthstone's 1 mana per turn increase permanently makes the game play out nicely, so no bad hands here with no land in it or the wrong types of mana. Combine this with Artifact's victory condition, and the game allows many more comebacks and epic victories or defeats because you have more chances to change the game's direction.

[*] [b]Deck building -  [/b] Deck Building in Artifact is a breeze. You select five heros, three of which come out instantly on the board. This allows you to have a definite strategy in mind when designing your deck. Each Hero comes into your deck with its signature card, giving you a basis to build around and support. Sorting through your owned collection of cards is easy due to the filters you can apply to see only hero, creeps, spells, or items. There is also a graphical breakdown of the amount of each color in your deck, so you can eyeball if you have enough of each color to support your heros on the board. Decks are 40 cards minimum, no maximum and you must have at least 10 items. 

[*] [b]Getting the cards you want -  [/b] Unlike other digital card games out there, Artifact allows you to buy any card that other players have put up for sale. Prices are adjusted due to demand and some other factors. But to break down the price points of this - I paid 3.50 for 25 cards , some of them rares, that completed a fun blue/black creep rush deck. You are easily able to buy commons and uncommons you need for a mere .05 USD cents or a bit more for popular cards. Some cards that are highly in demand right now will go for up to 10-20 dollars. This is the norm for any card game however and should not be a fault of this game. 

[h1]Should I get Artifact?[/h1]
I believe Artifact is the logical evolution of Magic and Hearthstone. The pacing here is what Magic players will crave. The price points are perfect for a player on a budget who loves card games ( boosters are 2$ USD and you can pick up single cards for mere cents). Plenty of people are online and playing it, matchmaking is quick. Finally, the game is pretty and has a solid sound design, with heros making fun statements every now and then. Artifact gets it right across the board as far as I am concerned.
As an older gamer I remember the original paper card games of Magic and D&D. In my country it wasn't very popular so I had to buy them eventually in shops who imported them. That was expensive and even then you had to search for other players which was tough.

So a few years ago I started playing the Magic card games on PC. I think overall they are well executed, but they lost some connection with the original paper card games.

I also play HS (Hearthstone) now and then. I bought all expansion packs, a few card packs a month and do my daily quests. I have a decent collection now, but I start loosing interest since they split the play modes, and made a lot of cards and collections obsolete.

This exactly was my fear for a PC based collection game.
If the digital content get restricted, you actually loose your collection, the cards their value.
The playmodes offered to play with all cards are less interesting and it has become less rewarding to play and to collect.

So I was very happy when Valve announced Artifact with the intention to solve some of those issues.

But stupid as I am I took the negative Steam reviews too serious and hold of on release day.
Lucky as I was (thank you Ryan Dorkoski who answered all my questions honestly at forehand) a Steam reviewer and Steam friend told me to give it a try, warned me about not opening the packs yet so I kept the refund ability etc and he answered all my questions. Not all what I wanted to hear, there are still negative parts (later more), but honest and it helps a lot to make my choice to step in.

What NOT to expect:

This is not a free game and it's not a free to play game. People who play paid serious money for the games framework and ability to play. That means most people who play now play because they like to play and not because they like to grind.
Profit is that you will not encounter many people using "concede" and you will encounter longgoing games (10 -30 minutes) even since you start with the TWO basic decks offered when you start.

Next to that you will have FIVE packs of cards, containing 12 cards each, wich will give you at least some rare and uncommon cards that you can alter the standard deck with.
Together with skill in playing cardgames, the very interesting mechanism (later more) that will not decide every game by the opening hand. There is variation in tactics you need luck and patience, but as a generic player I was able to win a few games against lvl 5 to lvl 7 players with and lvl up to 4 quckly that also gave me experience, tickets for special events and card packs.

You CANNOT trade your cards directly with other Steam friends or players, but there is an economy so you can sell unwanted cards and buy cards you want. This is great because it gives the feeling of a real collection with some value if you have expensive cards in your collection.

You CANNOT buy the game, with the very standard cards offerd build your own deck and be competive in ranked play. Don't try, you will be crushed and the fun will go away. Maybe some masters in mathematics and prof players can, but my attempt stranded badly. But I don't see this as something negative. I knew this at forehand and it's fair to the collectors with bigger card collections.

What you CAN DO in Artifact is A LOT

You can play games with constructed decks of cards you do not own. So you can experiment with all kind of decks. Your opponent play with the same decks, so it's totally based on skill and not on collection.

You can earn (or but) tickets and participate in tournaments and special events. This way you can earn rewards like XP, new tickets and cardpacks in different play modes and if you are getting skilled in the game at a more frequent rate.

What people say in their reviews that you will get nothing for free is simply Bull Sh#t!

I was not even planning to start playing Artifact this weekend, but since I pressed the play button I have 8 hours in and did not even used any of my tickets yet. I was just playing, leveling up, learning the game, watch opponents strategies etc etc 
More then enough content offered for the price you pay for the main game.

If you really want to invest in the game, the price for 60 cards is lower then 10 Euro in my country atm. Don't forget those cards also have real value after you bought them. This is NOT expansive compared to other games in the genre. It's not even possible to compare since "the other" games don't have an aconomy around the cards at all.

If you want to play with friends, but you don't want to function as a food for one of your friends who already invested a lot in the game you can organize tournaments with deck restrictions. I didn't tried any of it yet since I only have 8 hours ingame so far and simply have more to do then I can handle.
At work I was even thinking to play Artifact at home. That mostly means a game is good.

It's getting a longer review then I was planning to write, but I'm simply excited of what it already is and what it can become.

The game itself is a very traditional compared to other games, but with some fresh twists never seen before.
One game you play on multiple boards (3), those "lanes" you can continue monitor the whole game.
But if gives an extra layer of strategy and helps mid and end games not become boring.
You or your opponent never play well on all three boards at the same time, so you will use this as an advantage even when you are at the loosing hand. Important is to know that you always need to destroy two out of the three towers, but even if you are able to destroy only one, you have a change to win on that board by also destroying the artifact.
Well there is a lot to tell about strategy, carddraws, ingame shop while you playing to buy cards while you play etc etc etc. 
You simply have to experience it yourself.

This is a great game, made with lot's of love and attention to detail.
For example: EVERY card not only have a custom text and artist name on it, but also a play button that gives you fully voice overed comments on every card. Every card a different comment with all totally different voices.

The same for the cards, the lore and the UI. It's all very smooth, but not casual smooth. There is handpainted art combined with effects and very funny monsters on the board, fully animated and funny, that function like some kind of audience while you play. This is really great and adds to the game imo.
I have really totally nothing at al with DOTA, but I love the lore and don't feel I miss anything because I don't know that other game well.

I really hope that if I have some Steam friends in my activity feed who love to play a good card game now and then will consider to pick this game up so we can play together and organize tournaments.

Feel free to leave feedback and/or questions in the comments or talk to me on chat.

I would give the game 85 out of 100 now, with improvement that can easily turn it into 90 very early in 2019.

Overall I have blast with the game and I believe it's really made for players to have fun.
If you already want to call it a cashgrab or money grab feel free to do, but keep in mind that it also offers value for this money.

Thank you for reading.
tl;dr
Artifact has the best monetization model of any digital TCG on the market.



I can’t help but think that people complaining about the monetization model are complete ignorant concerning TCG games. Especially digital ones.

Every single other game forces you to grind for packs to build decks. They have a complete RNG loot box system that you have to throw your money at to be able to be competitive.

Artifact is not like this at all. You get to choose which card you want and buy it.

Axe is 14 bucks right now at launch. Most of the other cards are below 50 cents.

How in the world of TCG could you possibly be upset about how the game is monetized?

Unless you expect all of the cards to be given to you with your 20 dollar purchase? In this case rip for the longevity of the game and future expansions.

I honestly think this is a case of the Reddit/internet hive mind. Same thing happens with every game. As soon as the bozo with the loudest voice complains about something everyone jumps on board to rally with this idiot. I’m not saying these things are never justified because there are plenty of reasons to “rally” but there are just as many misplaced ones as there are justified ones.

The monetization is something that the TCG community has been waiting for for a long time.

On top of all this the most balanced way to play (drafting) is fucking free. Casual phantom draft allows you to use all of the cards in the set for free.

This coupled with tournaments with friends is revolutionary in the realm of online TCG games so before you start rallying along with the crowd that’s against the monetization please get informed because the way valve has chosen to launch this game is a giant step in the right direction for the TCG genre as a whole.
update for the nerf/buff patch:  still a good game. 1v1 me mid noob.

this game is pretty good. sure, you have to pay for cards, but that's only if you want to "own" digital pictures with numbers. the balanced game-mode, and probably what tournaments will run (since it showcases more skill than rng of the draw), is free. it's called "casual phantom draft". no, you won't get to build that op deck you read about; those will be found in "constructed", where money is king. fuck that mode though. let the rich idiots smell their own farts with their "combo decks". they're going to be killed anyway when the socialist revolution begins.  eat the rich, guillotine the rich, play artifact, good game!  bye.
I Personally need some kind of reward for playing. Like in Hearthstone, you earn gold every time you win 3 in a row, you have daily quests and such. Dont get me wrong, I really like playing artifact, but it gets a bit boring since it is not rewarding.
Changing my review due to the recent additions to the game. You can get a lot out of this game without spending anything outside the initial purchase price. Infinite free draft is amazing and so is the special event with leaderboards. Being able to communicate with your opponent is super nice as well. Big kudos to Valve for being so on top of adding features players want.
With the latest patch a great game just became even greater. I like that they fixed the cards that had balance problems and the fact that I can now see how I compare to other players.¨

Note:
The reason I got this game for free is because I bought the steam controller.
You probably heard pretty bad stuff about this game, mainly that you have to pay for everything and that there is minimal to no balancing being done.
Valve's initial goal was to "protect" card value and prevent card prices from crashing through freely obtainable cards or balancing. Gabe Newell did a whole Powerpoint presentation on that a year ago.
If you're like me, you don't really give a damn about your collection's value, and you embrace balance changes for the sake of better gameplay.
Well, as of today Valve changed their stance on the whole thing. Overrepresented cards got sensible nerfs, and I mean sensible, not nuking them from orbit (looking at you, Blizzard); undervalued cards got some buffs, and the most annoying card of them all got a complete rework since its original design is just anti-fun.
Valve also added a progression system to earn free card packs and event tickets (which you can use to get more packs).
As this goes against their original design philosophy (which was to not give anything out for free and only balance blatantly broken cards), players get a one-time offer to resell affected cards back to Valve at their peak price from shortly before the balancing announcement, so people who are really in it for the card economy don't get cheated out of their value.

So what about the game itself?

I haven't been a card game enthusiast so far; I mostly played Hearthstone a few months back for roughly a year or two and while I had fun with it, the genre failed to really captivate me.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that that completely changed, but I do believe I will stick with Artifact and it will become my go-to side game. Games involve more player choice and interaction, you very rarely go on auto-pilot and have to adjust your strategy constantly. It can be quite mentally draining, but that challenge is the whole fun in it.

People say the game is riddled with RNG and I don't really get it (well, I got it with Cheating Death, but that card was reworked into a non-RNG card). Sure, there is creep spawns and attack arrows every turn but the game gives you a buttload of tools to work around them, and I just can't fathom how somebody coming from Hearthstone (I won't even go into detail here, most of HS's cards are built around random effects - which is fine for a casual game) or MTG (which truthfully I haven't played, but you hear a lot about getting mana screwed/flooded) can think Artifact has too much of it.

People say the game is too expensive. True, there is the upfront cost of 20$ / 17.50€ and it can turn down somebody who just wants to try out the game, but with that price you can play Phantom Drafts (without expansions so far considered the most fun mode) for free and on top of that earn packs that way.
I don't want to get too much into this, but if you want a specific card you can buy it (possibly with money you made from free packs) with Valve taking 15% interest. Compare that with other developers taking, I don't know, 75% interest. The thing is that in other games you don't directly use money, you use some fantasy gibberish currency, so it doesn't feel like you're actually paying. It's just dust or gold or whatever. But that dust or gold was paid for - either with money, or with time.

I don't want to sound like a Valve fanboy but clearly I am, and I wouldn't want to jump to a game's defense like this but look at me, here I am spouting about why this game is so much better than everybody says.

But this game gets a lot of flak, and it doesn't deserve it.
To everyone who gave a negative review because of no progression, no free and grind rewards, no card balance and market is top priority, be sure to update your reviews.
I like the deep strategy and levels of thinking going on in this game, which I don't think I have found in any other card game.

[MONETIZATION]

You are basically paying for a bundle (2 decks, 5 tickets and 10 packs) which I don't have a problem with.
The reason it can't be F2p is because then there would be bots everywhere and trying to game the market system.

[IF YOU WANT PACKS WITHOUT PAYING £££]

To get rewards for wins you must enter a ticket (Phantom draft). If you are good at the game and win, 3-5 games in a row, you get your ticket back plus some packs. (keep doing this and you can see where its going)

   [WHERE I STAND]
      I would like to be able to earn packs some way without it devaluing cards on the market (IDK if this is possible.) maybe have weekly login reward of a pack or something...

[WHAT THE GAME REALLY NEEDS]

I feel like These are coming in future updates though

Social interactions:
    Watch games
    Replay games
    Look at stats of players and friends
    Level and ranking system (something like DOTA PLUS)
    Add the last person you played
    etc

Basically implement what is already in DOTA and CSGO.
[b]TL;DR:[/b] Artifact is a truly unique card game with strong core mechanics. However, you should consider how much the more questionable aspects of the game will bother you before buying.

Edit: Updated for patch 1.2.

[b]--Core gameplay--[/b]
Artifact's core mechanics are certainly unique and I can't think of any card game that does something similar. You battle over 3 lanes simultaneously and win the game by either winning two lanes or overwhelmingly dominating a single lane. Usually this leads to abandoning one lane at a strategically convenient time and focussing on the two others, but depending on your deck this may vary. Sometimes, especially in draft mode because the decks aren't as refined there, this focus on lanes switches rapidly as your opponent reacts to what you are doing - that's probably my favorite aspect of the game. The heros are definitely a unique mechanic as well - these are the five units that enable you to use your cards and come back to the game eventually if they are killed. 
It is certainly much more complex than its competitors, as you have multiple resources (mana, cards, heroes) to manage and there are many variations to consider over the next few turns every time you play, which takes a lot of concentration each game. It is a very challenging game to learn and that definitely makes it a niche game in an already niche genre. 

[b]--So much RNG?--[/b]
There is a fair amount of randomness in addition to the card draw. However, each rng event on its own is not very impactful and they are occuring quite frequently, so any advantage usually averages out quite quickly. Most of the random aspects are designed in a way that lets you react to the outcome and a lot of skill comes from choosing which unfavourable circumstances you should mitigate. Occasionally the random aspects can be quite frustrating - especially if your deck focusses on a color with only few reactive options.

[b]--Monetization--[/b]
A lot of this game revolves around the fact that the digital cards you buy are treated like physical products that can be traded on the steam market place. This especially means, that there is no free way to earn more cards through play. Only modes with an entry fee allow you to win cards. While I think this experiment is certainly interesting from a game design perspective, and while I see the benefits of being able to buy the cards that you want directly, as a player I don't particularly like it.
Just be aware that: [u]This is not a 20$/18€ game![/u]
If you like card games for their collection-building aspect, be prepared to spend a lot more than that. For playing the constructed game mode, expect to buy many additional cards before you have a viable deck as some cards are just essential. The power level of expensive, properly optimized decks is so far above anything you can build from your first 10 packs you get with the game, that playing constructed is basically pointless without spending additional money.
The "expert" play modes that allow you to win additional card packs, require an entry fee in the for of event tickets that can either be bought or obtained by recycling any 20 cards. While the 5 tickets for these modes that you get with your initial purchase last you quite a bit (as Artifact games tend to take around 15-20 min each), if you favor these game modes be prepared to occasionally having to buy new tickets.

[b]--Low cost play options--[/b]
Before throwing out  the game in frustration after reading the last section, consider that there are quite a few options that don't require a big investment.
[list]
[*] Draft modes do not require that you have a big collection: The casual draft mode takes no entry fee whatsoever and draft mode tournaments are supported by the tournament system in game!
[*] There is also a game mode where you play with preconstructed decks of various colors. The way it is presented makes it look like there will be various rotating events, but the game is not out long enough to know what will be offered in the future.
[*] If you like the deck building aspect, but don't want to spend much on your collection, there are currently communities forming around the "pauper" format. This is game mode where only common cards can be used. Buying all the common cards from the market place only costs a few Euros. The meta is going to be quite different in this format as essential uncommons and rares are not available in this format (e.g. Blink Dagger, a staple item in constructed, is uncommon).
[/list]

[b]--Card design--[/b]
The complaints below are no longer up to date, because as of patch 1.2. Valve decided that they will rebalance cards despite the disturbance to the market it may cause. The most problematic cards were addressed in that patch.
[strike]While overall the initial set seems to be a good starter set, there are a few very clear outliers, that make me question if there even is a coherent design philosophy.
The two most expensive cards on the market right now, Axe and Drow, are the best read and green heros, respectively. There is no reason whatsoever why you wouldn't include them if you play that color. They are so far above any competition, that even if you nerfed Axe by 1 Attack, or made Drow's Signature cost more Mana, they would STILL be the best hero of their color. I can imagine no reason that does not contain the word money for allowing this to happen.
Then there is the green card Cheating Death, that basically contradicts everything I wrote about randomness earlier. It is a card that gives each of your units in the lane a 50% to not die, if they would die, as long as there is a green hero in that lane. You cannot tell whether this will trigger or not beforehand, so you can't plan around it and just have to hope. And while it is likely not overpowered (being able to simply abandon a lane mitigates stuff like this), it is extremely unfun to play against and seems to work directly against the way that randomness is generally used in this game.
The fact that Valve will treat the cards like physical objects and not make changes to them, in order to not to disturb the market, makes it very unlikely anything will be changed about issues like that.[/strike]

[b]--Conclusion--[/b]
I feel relieved that Valve decided to change their stance towards rebalancing cards. Personally, I think that the unique gameplay makes it worth the initial price tag just to try it out. If the collectible aspect and the constructed game mode are not your focus, it is not going to be a huge money sink. However, I still feel a bit uneasy about recommending this game to others because of the monetization system. I'd suggest to keep that in mind when deciding whether to buy this game.
Easily the top slot for me of the card games on the market. Simple mechanics that are played in a ruleset that allow for nuanced, interesting play.

Cheapest card game available by a long shot - full set of all the cards is significantly cheaper than a single Hearthstone expansion, for example.

Graphics are beautiful, heroes are interesting. Only negative bit from me is how some of the cards have 'bad feel' RNG - one outcome will always make one of the players feel worse. Otherwise I highly recommend giving this game a shot.
I played magic the gathering competitively for 4 years. This is a much better game than hearthstone in my opinion. Also anyone who has played modo will be happy to know you can buy/sell singletons on the steam market - and a competitive deck is only around 90 dollars. Compared to the hundreds you'd be spending playing magic, coupled with the event ticket and booster system, it's a very attractive tcg.
Artifact is a fun, thought-intensive strategy card game, with great production value (audio/visuals, voiced lore for every card, etc).  However, the reward structure is notably lacking - the average user will be unable to 'go infinite' in the paid modes that let you keep cards, and the free modes currently give you no cards at all.  If you want cards to keep (and build a constructed deck), you will be paying extra money for them - either in game or on the Steam Market.  

The lack of any type of free progression for simply playing games may be a turn off for some, given the modern era of gaming.  Of course, it should also be noted that with no in game currency to grind out, Artifact is perhaps the only card game on the market to offer infinite phantom drafting (or Arena for Hearthstone folks), with no grind to 'earn' each play involved (albeit with no rewards for doing well, other than a hearty self-pat on the back).  Drafting can be the most fun modes in any card game, as it puts everyone on an even playing field with brand new decks every time - so offering it for free is a definite plus.

If you're on the fence about whether to purchase this game, please note that the game is more likely <$10 and potentially free as long as you follow the steps below (note: this may only apply for the first week-month or so of release).

[olist]
[*]Buy game as soon after the 11/28/2018 release as possible.
[*] [b]DO NOT OPEN YOUR PACKS[/b] (you'll want to use them for 'Keeper Draft' instead)
[*]Play a bit of Phantom Draft to get used to the game.
[*]Play 2 rounds of 'Keeper Draft' using the included packs and tickets, making sure to draft most all rares and some valuable uncommons.  This step is very important, as not only is keeper draft fun, you'll likely get more rares/money than if you just opened the packs (in draft mode, you draft with 'bots', who pass you packs they open and have chosen their own cards out of...sometimes skipping the rares).
[*][b]After drafting, SELL all your opened rare cards on the Steam Market![/b]  You'll likely earn about $5 to $25 if you made sure to pick up all rares and are reading this review in the opening week.
[*]Enjoy your free-ish game!  
[/olist]

Depending on what cards you open, the game may still cost you a few bucks... but if you get lucky, Valve might end up paying you a little bit instead.  I expect market prices to dwindle as packs are opened and the initial rush to dive into constructed dies down, so the sooner you sell all your cards, the better off you'll probably be (and you can always buy them back later).  Additionally, once you've sold off all the cards that came with the game, Artifact includes free phantom drafts forever, as well as rotating 'events' with specific constructed decks to play with.


[i]DISCLAIMER:  After some time, prices will probably drop across the board and the average user will see a smaller return on their investment - if you are a visitor from the future, you might not get much money back from selling the cards.[/i]
I was originally super hyped for this game (and still enjoy playing it right now), but after a few hours you start to realize that there aren't enough cards or variety in the gameplay - it's often either find ways to deal direct damage or overwhelm the board to win due to the tiny card pool. In addition, the heroes are fairly unbalanced, causing constructed to be bottlenecked in card selection as well. However the game is extremely nail-biting and complex due to the initiative mechanic and multiple lanes, and I find myself coming back every now and then for a few rounds. Not a bad game, but currently not one I would recommend to friends until balancing is done or more cards are added to the pool

EDIT: Valve has shown that they are willing to balance cards and have added a progression system, so I can recommend Artifact now :)
Dear Reader, 
Before you either read or immediately dismiss this review, take notice in the fact that I previously   did not recommend this game, and have now changed it to a positive recommendation, which will be explained for one sole reason stated below.
Valve has now decided that the cards should be properly rebalanced instead of sticking to their claim that the game will not change from day one. This shows a certain humility and open-mindedness on Valve's part. Considering today's market where games companies constantly tell the bold faced lie where they claim to be listening to their customers, Valve is one of the very few that actually follow up on this promise. Valve has went against its own promise in light of some negative backlash in order to restore the relationship it has with its customers. Not only that, but Valve offered to buy back the cards that were bought at their peak price within the last 24 hours of the patch, hoping to make ammends with those that this patch might have even harmed.
I hope this evidence alone can sway you to believe that this game is now truly worth the initial price tag, however keep in mind that if you do indeed want more cards, more money would be required of you. With that said, thanks to the changes Valve has made, it is now possible to make a formidable deck with whatever you first recieve due to the balance patch. I believe that this game has been effectively redeemed with the recent actions of Valve and is now truly worth your time.
Big brain small wallet? Game is fun! Small brain big wallet? Game is fun! Big brain big wallet? Game is really fun! Small brain small wallet? Go play HS or complain on reddit.
Its a very good card game, really enjoyable and nice with abit of new. With 3 lanes and more strategy behind the dessisions you make. i easy recommend this game, the microtransactions can be abit much for some people. But even with them the game is easy worth a try if you enjoy card games.

You can trade and buy cards from the marketplace and i would guess that will be alot cheaper soon when card have started to go down in price.
Very fun card game that requires lots of work, feels a bit like early access. Lots of careful consideration was put into crafting the games systems and balance. My favourite part is the design philosophy of 'no limits to anything' pretty much any value you can think of can be buffed to infinity, no limits to cards in hand, cards in a lane, amount of health a hero has, amount of damage you can deal, etc... everything is uncapped (and the game is balanced around that).

The presentation of everything is really impressive, Artifact has the best graphics and music I have ever seen in any digital card game and aside from a few annoying controls everything works super smoothly.

[strike]There's lots of room for improvement right now as the game has no chat, or even any way to communicate with your opponent, there's no in-game progression or any kind of ranking system or MMR. All of this is expected and I was disappointed to see it missing. Some of the cards are extremely powerful so that you will see them in every single game you play of constructed, Valve will also not change the stats of any cards despite the fact that they easily can, unlike physical card games.

Right now I think I have gotten my money's worth but I expect the game to improve with updates as there are several much-needed changes.[/strike]

UPDATE: Valve have released a huge update within only a month that fixed most of my complaints. There is now a leveling system, ranking system, card rebalancing and rewards for playing such as card packs, tickets and cosmetics.

+Very fun and deep card game
+Great design philosophies
+Infinite phantom draft
+Card rebalancing!
+Great job at mimicking the dota experience in a card game
+Amazing graphics and music
+Valve REALLY listens to feedback and acts quickly

+- Requires full attention, not casual relaxing game
+- RNG (but that's to be expected in a card game)
+- Monetisation method is questionable

-Playing constructed is a bit stale due to overused decks
If people stopped to use Review to communicate with the developer/publisher of the game, the reviews of Artifact would be much better. Because the game is Good. I've been a card player my whole life, and this one is in the top 5.

The game is exactly what it was advertised from the beginning, so if you don't like TCGs don't bu a TCG. Even then it's not really fair, because yes it is a TCG but it's also a game with plenty of free and good game modes. 

The game plays well, the UI is good, the game is fun, the game is hard to master, it is interesting, it is stressful. 

I never spend a dollar in F2P game, but I was happy to spend 8 more bucks to buy 2 decks I found interesting. Why ? Because : 1. I know exactly what I pay for (I don't buy a chance of something => lootbox). 2. I can sell back the cards, even with some money loss, I wil have had my fun with it.

Like some good Twitch card player said, before having an opinion on this game : think for yourself and make your own opinion about it.
This is the first digital card game I've really gotten into, and I really enjoy it.

The depth of the gameplay is attractive to me. I especially like that losing often feels more like it was caused by misplays rather than being screwed by card draw or other randomness. I haven't played enough, and the game hasn't been out enough, for the meta to be very clear, but it still feels like unusual decks can be viable, which I love.

I prefer the business model of not having to grind for cards, instead just being able to buy single cards for nickles on the market. In addition, being able to play unlimited phantom draft at no extra cost means that I don't really need cards if I don't want to play constructed.

On Linux, this requires Vulkan, eliminating my old laptop from playing it directly, but that isn't a huge concern for me as I rarely every use it, and if I do I rarely play games. It runs excellently for me on my desktop, though, consistently smooth, as expected.
Tons of fun. Extremely responsive, interactive card game that keeps you on your toes.

I'm a long time MTG fan and I'm loving Artifact for so many reasons. The heroes are a unique mechanic that give you things to build around in your decks, and the tri-board means games are a lot less predictable.

I highly recommend you pick this up if you're a fan of card games of any kind.
Don't be scared away by the reviews. 

The marketing system scares many off, but realistically it's the best way of giving any monetary value to cards. And that was the point of this Trading Card Game, announced very early on. 
Most people are used to get free packs or gain some kind of in-game currency by just playing. But imagine running a few hundred bots 24/7 to earn cards for free and selling them on the market, dragging prices down to a few cents at best.

If you don't want any part of collecting cards or paying to play gauntlets, you can still play the casual modes, where you can't win prizes. You are able to play for free and do not require your own collection of cards. So unless creating custom decks is the only thing you enjoy in card games or you hate playing casual matches in general, you can still find enjoyment in this game without investing money.

[b]TL;DR:[/b] Get good and go infinite, or pay trying. Otherwise stick to casual modes, that still give you access to strong theme decks or your own draft.
Wow! I must congratulate Valve for listening to the community's complaints about the game's economy and addressing them in this latest patch. Playing the game will now give booster rewards based on XP progression and cards that are too OP or too RNG will be balanced.

Anyone that is a fan of card games should definitely try Artifact if they are tired of Hearthstone clones and want to experience something new. Note that most of the negative reviews are only based on the game's economy and Valve responded by changing this aspect drasticly. Granted, the game is still not Free-to-play but for it's cost you will have a lot of free content to explore and you will now get more boosters just for playing.


EDIT: the turnaround! 
Very good card game. There is RNG but the kind you need to learn to play around by basing your decisions on a few possibilities, not the one that makes the game completly random.
Valve is listening to its user base and did change their design and bizness philosophy 3 weeks after release based on players feedback:
-Cards are balanced on the go
-new game modes have been introduced
-ways to earn boosters have been introduced
-ranking has been introduced
GGWP valve
I grew up with CCGs.  When I was in high school, MtG was just hitting the mainstream and everyone was coming out with a new CCG every week.  I played them all, from Star Wars to Highlander to Netrunner along with a half dozen others I can't even remember, I've always had a deep appreciation for card games.  The randomness mixed with the strategy always appealed to me and the perfect balance was where the randomness supplemented the strategy, but didn't take over.  A solid gameplan, risk mitigation, and deck building would usually win out over a good run of top decks.  Although a good run of top decks never hurts...

So far, Artifact appears to hit that balance very well.  I can say for certain that Artifact always, and I mean ALWAYS rewards you for thinking several steps ahead.  The three lane structure forces you to evaluate each lane independently first, and then as part of the whole.  This can lead to all sorts of strategies and mind games.  Baiting your opponent into overcommiting on a lane only to pull the rip cord and bail on it so you can win a different lane feels amazing.  When you're starting a new round and you zoom out, realizing you can snipe their hero in a contentious lane 3 and deny them any plays, so you just hold priority through the first two lanes?  There are so many factors to consider at any given time, Artifact truly rewards the patient and thoughtful player.  It absolutely forces you into strategic thinking and long-term planning.  Maybe at some point it will introduce cards that will let a player autopilot through games, but so far this is not that game.  There is no equivalent to Red Deck Wins here.  Even the most simple and common action, hero deployment, can have enormous consequences if done without careful consideration.

Game balance so far seems okay, though plenty of room for improvement.  Some heroes are just bad with very few redeeming qualities, and as a result deck variety is relatively low.  In competitive constructed, you tend to see the same heroes over and over and over again despite them only representing about 1/3 of the overall roster.  Even in draft, there are a number of heroes that are just a straight avoid when you see them.  It's unfortunate because if the power amongst heroes were more evenly distributed, I think it would drastically open up deck variety.  That being said, it seems like an easily fixable problem as the game matures.  It's not great right now, but the core mechanics feel solid with a lot of room for expanding in interesting ways, and I really am looking forward to seeing what they do with future heroes.

Finally, I'd like to address the monetization structure.  As I mentioned earlier, I've played a lot of physical card games, along with a number of digital ones that I haven't mentioned, and building a top-tier deck for $50 or less feels like a steal to me.  Again, that's just a matter of perspective since I'm an adult with a job, but even if you don't have the money to build a top tier constructed deck, grinding can be very inexpensive (though not free, which I guess is the complaint).  For my money, it seems pretty reasonable that you can grind rewards at an initial entry fee of $1, which can reward you as little as nothing, you get your $1 back if you make it to 3 wins, and you can get $5 worth of prizes if you get all the way to five wins, then rinse and repeat.  And if none of that appeals to you, you can always play for free for the satisfaction of winning but no rewards.  For talented players, I think it will be a system that's relatively easy to "go infinite" with and for those less skilled, they can bow out and just play for free without rewards.  I'd also be a bit surprised if they never introduce a way for players to go completely F2P and still earn rewards.  I guess we'll see.

Overall, I think Artifact offers an incredibly deep and rewarding game system, despite some initial balance issues and arguably non-ideal monetization structure.  I think it's well worth the $20 for CCG lovers to check out and see if they think investing more money is worth it, or maybe just play casual drafts and featured decks for the fun of just stomping some people.
So... Artifact.

*Take my "Thumbs up" as a "Mixed" review.*

Extremely polished, gorgeous and solid card game.

Monetization is not well done though. 
Without spending Money, like atleast 5-10€ per month, you won't be happy with it.

With about 180€ spend on the game, I own every Card.
The only thing that rescues this game at the moment is that you can specifically buy cards directly, so that your Dream Deck is not dependant on RNG.

Oh and well... It's Valve, expect them to Safe this game, pretty sure some other reward system will be implemented.
This game is fantastic, and ill address some criticism and blatent lies near the end, I love competitive and stratergy games and this game scratches both itches and is the most unique and satisfying card game ive ever played, and ive tried many different card games and none of them have held or interest me like this one.

The best info I can give you is the game isn't as complicated as it may seem, the mechanics are very intuitive and so is the deck building, it has a very good tutorial which can be skipped, I bring this point up because I remember when I first saw artifact I thought it would be horribly complicated and take a long time to learn but I honestly got the grips with it after my very first game.

Artifact also rewards creativity better than any other card game ive played, possibly a meta will come out for the "best decks" but ive yet to see those op cards that everyone will have in their decks, thats because with the combinations of 4 colours (which are the 4 different play styles) which can each be combined in any way possible, with the combination of 5 different heroes and 3 boards, decks can vary massively and all be competitive. There are preferred cards such as Axe always being sold high, but having an Axe in your deck doesn't mean victory or id argue even increase your chances since Axe himself has his weaknesses. There is so much more depth to the game, I haven't even gone into the details on items and equipping them to your hero, but if I can say this game has huge depth but is also intuitive enough to learn at least the basics after one game, that must be some pretty genious game design.

Now to address the criticisms and some lies in the reviews
- The game isnt Pay to win, the cards you buy are used in casual decks against friends and strangers, friends can borrow each others cards and (eventually) trade them, to anyone who has never played card games as a hobby this may seem weird, but believe it or not artifact is the cheapest card game to be released. PC gamer recently released a good article on it if you need more information but artifact is not just the cheapest digital card game but also the cheapest compared to real card games.
- You have to waste 15 dollars on 1 card, No most cards are below 30 cents in price, the few exceptions are the insanely popular cards such as Axe and Drow ranger being fan favourites, you can also sell your own cards to aquire others, trade commons for tickets to earn more decks.
- You can only play draft mode if you buy tickets, No there are casual versions of every single mode, you only spend tickets if you want to be in the draw for rewards.
- There is no ranked, This is actually true, but valve released this information a long time ago that there would be no rank ladder and only competitive tournaments, and they also added in community tournaments in game that can be hosted with over 100 people so thats where you find the competitive scene, after playing in 2 tournaments, they are an absolute blast.

A lot of the comments make me think of players who are possibly too young to remember the days of having to buy physical cards, the process of opening a card pack getting your random cards + a guarantee of a rare one, sellling and trading the cards away for others that you actually wanted, this is an experience that valve set out to replicate from the beginning, and as stated before artifact is the cheapest card game whether or not you choose to believe people have grinded game time for cards on hearthstone when the fact of the matter is you HAVE to buy all of hearthstones expansions to be competitive, and by speaking as someone who has played MtG, hearthstone, gwent, even pokemon and yugioh back when I was young, this is the most fulfilling card game to me, and at 32 hours into the game ive yet to spend a single dollar and I have multiple decks with huge variations so thats what I can speak from personal experience.

So do yourself a favour and research the game yourself, keep in mind its easier than it looks, and take everyones compliments and complaints with a pinch of salt, because card game communities always feud and kids always complain about money, but if you like stratergy or card games I highly recommend to at least give it a look or you might miss out on this gem.
Instead of saying it's bullshit you have to buy the game and then buy the cards, consider the fact that you get 10 free card packs that would normally cost the same as the game does. So really Valve is just saying, you have to buy at least 10 card packs to have a functional deck, adn that is the base cost of the game, it really is not something to complain about. And on top of that, if you really don't want to spend another cent on the game, you can just draft. Drafting with friends is pretty good and free, go have fun. But as with any trading card game, you have to invest to get the best cards, to be able to win constructed deck matches. Not a huge surprise there.
Got Artifact for free at TI, at first I was bored with the streams and all the gameplay videos. I was about to write it off entirely after the drama regarding monetization but then Valve did something no other dev would have ever done. They listened to players, and fixed their game.

They made so many parts free so you can essentially play them for free forever (free casual phantom draft) and added recycling (which also helps fix the monetization economy as it sets the lowest base price for a trash card at 0.05USD, which improves pack EV).

And after more drama was raised over the deck trackers, LO AND BEHOLD they listened again and fixed it and even explained their reasoning without being stupid and condescending like most other devs. I'll also be the first to say I was VERY wrong about Artifact, I didn't care at all after watching all the gameplay videos but since I played it in the closed Beta I found that it was actually EXTREMELY fun to play.

I'm now definitely sticking around, because Valve clearly loves this game and respects it community, and that alone buys my trust and loyalty. Add on that the fact that Artifact is an EXTREMELY fun game to play, and is NOT that expensive to get into (fully free draft modes without entry fees for fun, a full set doesn't cost much either just over 200USD which is 10x cheaper than HS unless you literally grind that on a daily basis and maybe around the same with Gwent assuming reasonable playtimes)

Thanks Valve, you made an actually great game despite all my initial apprehensions.

(only issue now is since there aren't THOSE many players yet you have some assholes now trying to manipulate prices, but then you just open packs instead and undercut them)


Long and detailed, but these are my thoughts.

Artifact is a mastefully crafted TCG with the strategy and depth I was waiting for. If you want free cards go grind your ass for card crumbs in Hearthstone and get a descent playset in maybe a few months, if that's what you're coming from. This is not what Artifact is about as the cards have a real value and you can trade them, There are a few modes with prizes that require an entry fee in form of tickets and packs, and those are the only parts you have to pay to play. If it doesn't involve prizes, you can play it completely free. Think of it not as a video game, but as an actual physical card game that removes the boundaries of localization and what's impossible to make in a physical game and allows you to play and have fun with everyone around the world, and you'll start to understand what Artifact is about, but there are still the parts of a videogame that make it fun, such as the free casual modes that "lend" you infinite plays and cards to play with others, and I'll try to elaborate.

There are 2 major modes to play Artifact, Constructed and Draft.

Constructed: this is when you build a deck the way you want with your own cards, and as I said it requires you to own them, so it sometimes can feel pay 2 win, because you will often lose to decks with expensive cards that you didn't have access to because your opponent had more luck opening packs or straight up dropped some cash in the market to acquire those cards. But if that bothers you that much, check out Draft mode or just keep it cool and play for fun, It feels pretty good to beat an expensive deck with your budget deck, strategy and decision making are also very important so an expensive deck is not an auto win, specially if the player using it is not optimizing it along the match.

Draft: A few packs are opened and each player drafts 2 cards per pack and pass them around, until everyone gets to 60 cards, meaning they went through 5 entire packs, and this is the most "fair" game mode regarding money advantages, because each player has to work with the cards they were presented with, and you can't go out of your way to buy that $30 card on the market, unless a player got lucky and managed to draft it in a pack.

In the constructed mode it also feels like the player that bought the better(most expensive) cards have an advantage, but if you still feel that way even in casual constructed, you can always just keep it on casual draft or the featured mode that I believe will always be about premade decks being put against each other to try out new strategies and get a better understanding of some cards and the game, but if you're going to play constructed for prizes keep in mind you are most likely to find tryhard expensive decks in constructed, and if you don't want to take on them too often, you can always stick to casual. The game feels fair and the RNG factors can almost always be worked around, which is part of the strategy too, sometimes it makes your life easier, sometimes makes it harder, but you can probably find a way around it with 200IQ plays, otherwise it wouldn't have mattered.

You can also play everything with your friends, organize tournaments, and a few other things in between. The only things lacking as of right now, is a draft mode for 1v1 with friends, and a ladder/ranked mode, if you're into that kind of thing.

It seems very overwhelming at first, but I believe after spending a few hours in it an average player is going to be able to grasp basically everything about it, but being able to master the strategy decision making on the fly during a match is something that will likely be very hard. I'm enjoying the game a lot and would like to see it succeed.
If you enjoy Draft format in CCGs, you can pay $20 and play draft forever for no additional cost.  I have been enjoying it thouroughly, as draft is my favorite format.

If you enjoy constructed and are willing to spend some additional money (just like you would for Magic constructed), I think you will really enjoy it as well.

If you are not willing to spend extra money but want to play Constructed, I do not recommend this game.
Really interesting cardgame.

The different take on turn structure really shakes things up. Instead of each player getting his or her own turn, they share a round. One player plays an action, then initiative passes to the next player, then back again, and so forth.

There's a lot of randomization elements over the course of a match, but the majority of it seems like the good kind of randomness. The type that adds variance and that can be worked around or even planned for. It feels like a good boardgame, in this regard.

A bit early for me to talk about balance and such, but initial impressions is that the first set feels "small" - not in the number of cards, but in the number of possibilities. Of course, this might just be a misleading first impression, as there's still much to be explored.
Great and fun game! I had a lot more fun than I thought I would. Definitely worth the $20.00, they give you 10 free packs and 5 free event tickets with the purchase of the game. 

There is a lot missing right now, though. There's no way to chat, no way to emote, no ranked ladder, no way to see any progress, and no way to see any statistics from your previous games. Knowing Valve, they will probably implement these features soon.

I recommend it to those who enjoy a complex card game. It may seem daunting at first, but it is easy to learn and hard to master.

This is the latest game Valve has made, hopefully they make more games soon.
As always Valve isn't that type of company which desperately makes any kind of game to capture industry market, but in fact Valve is that type of company which thrives to create original content, interesting gameplay with eye pleasuring graphics and competetive matchmaking.
So far this game has exceeded my expectations by far. As a competitive Magic: The Gathering player and a avid TCG player in general, I can say that this game is certainly a unique take on the age old genre. Many players are complaining about the non F2P model, while it is a tragedy one must realize that Magic in addition to other TCG's are not free by any means. In Magic, one can spend upwards of $500 on a single good deck, while in this game you can expect to pay $30-50 (at the time of this review). After doing the math, if you perform well with phantom draft you can essentially build an entire collection for free, this can be done through chaining your draft runs to earn both tickets and the packs. If I were to compare this to any other ccg I would say Artifact derives its core mechanics from GWENT, Hearthstone and most importantly Magic: The Gathering. 

TLDR: This game has a very solid base overall, if you don't want to pay $30-60 for a single good deck or invest time and effort to master phantom draft this isn't the game for you.
Very sophisticated squad-based CCG design that is both tactical and strategic, due to decoupled hero powers and multi-lane play; complex and nuanced decision-making with a high skill-cap
Never have i played a card game with this much depth. Artifact, when it comes to the actual game is amazing, fresh and deep as far as a skill ceiling goes.

With that said, the monetization system currently in place is not ideal in an age where F2P card games with grindable currencies reign supreme, making it a more demanding system than others. The game still warrants free modes of every mode available in it, as well as access to community driven tournaments in said modes.

Apart for this issue, an ingame chat and a ranked system to display any sort of progression would be welcome as well.

All in all, it's a far less expensive game when it comes to completing a card collection, but the fact remains that you HAVE to spend money in order to achieve this, whereas F2P card games allow you to bypass this with an ingame currency.

The game's amazing, the systems outside the gameplay design are not, the option to grind should be there even if i personally wouldn't use it to get cards that i want.
Great trading card game akin to PTCGO / Magic the gathering online.

Not a CCG which is what most people complains about as it seems to be what they were looking for.
You can play virtually the whole game for less than half the price tag of a triple a game. You get lots of free items and ample decks and people still have the audacity to complain. Worth buying.

Long have I been awaiting Artifact, the Dota Card game.

You will definitely have an opinion on this game's pricing model depending on whether you approach it as a card game player or a video game player; but even if you have hesitations about the pricing let it be known that there are amazing modes you can play here for free indefinitely once you've paid the base price.

Artifact isn't a copy of any other card game on the market, and its unique 3 lane system give an amazing amount of depth to all of your decisions. The constant alternating back and forth between player and opponent with each turn taken gives you agency in responding to each of their plays, and all of it is tied together with some incredible polish.

If you're a fan of card games, this game is well worthe taking the dive into. If you're not a fan of card games, both the pricing model and the games mechanics may be a bit overwhelming at first.

If you want to see my full thoughts, click [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-toXd5pbN8&feature=youtu.be]here[/url] for the video review.
10/10 -- Artifact feasts on the remnants of the traditional TCG's mechanics of yesteryear, and crushes it within its fists, making a new form to lead the industry. This may upset some, but Valve doesn't mind; they know exactly what they're doing.

This game is the pinnacle, mechanics-wise, of the new form of TCG games which we'll be seeing. Valve has been an innovator within the gaming industry for some time, and has rarely disappointed. Although there were negative reviews initially during the CBT/OBT regarding the MTX for Artifact, Valve listened carefully to community feedback and adjusted appropriately. 

Gabe Newell said that he wants to broaden the range of options regarding the creation of experience when it comes to interacting and engaging with video games -- this is true and pure within Artifact, as the game takes you on a journey beyond what other similar games would.

Don't be fooled, as Artifact is in a lane of its own. The balance seems tight right now, and the "premium" cards can be obtained easily without pouring too much cash into a full deck (much less overall than Hearthstone, if you want to attempt to downplay anything; various people have proven this statistically across the web).

Valve shows us that they're the best at what they do -- innovate and please -- and although there are mixed reviews due to the initial launch of this game, we will see within 2-3 years how much this game has influence on the industry at large. Several clones will be made (and obviously fail), and the ripples which Artifact creates will be sent across the ocean of creation. 

Artifact is a conduit through which Valve is telling the end user what they want to change in the industry -- how we look at games we've come accustomed to. They did it with Half-Life. They did it with Team Fortress. They did it with Counter-Strike. They did it with Left 4 Dead. They did it with Portal. They did it with Dota 2. They are now doing it with Artifact.

Examples outside of gaming?

Nas did this with Illmatic.
Kendrick Lamar did this with To Pimp A Butterfly.
Kanye West did this with Yeezus.

A quote, from Nasir "Nas" Jones, which I find relevant:

"Then froze, only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
And told my little man I'ma ghost, I broze
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: try to rise up above"

This is taken from the third verse of One Love, and is what I find to be what Valve is telling the end users -- "Yeah, we know what we're doing, and we know that you can make your own choice and have your own opinion -- but rise above the hate, and learn to approach Artifact with an open mind; be superior to those who shun it, those with a narrow mind, who do not accept Gabe Newell's/Richard Garfield's vision -- it's ok to be that way."

These are visionaries.
NEW REVIEW: There is progression now. It isn't great, but there is a reason to play.
We just got a balance patch which Valve earlier said they weren't going to do.
Earning cards is now a possibility. This should ease the market prices and make it cheaper to own decks for constructed.
Valve essentially fixed major problems of the game in one patch. Good job.

OLD REVIEW: No real progression. Costs a bit too much to actually own viable sets. Monitization of this game is absolutely shit.
Artifact is the most fun I have ever had with a card game by a long shot, and I have never been a card game fan outside of a few games. The game has something for everyone and the price tag is worth it for drafting with friends alone. There is a bit of a learning curve but it is well worth it for how rewarding correct and game winning plays and hero deployments feel.
Lots of negative reviews for one reason only: uninformed people complaining about the monetization model. On the other hand, being an avid card game player, I know that Valve's model is actually one of the best I've ever seen. Besides that controversial aspect, the game is amazing. Gameplay is fantastic, strategy levels are off the charts and play mode options are limitless. 
If you love card games get Artifact, if you love DOTA get Artifact, if you love in depth strategy get Artifact.
Great TCG.  20$ price tag isn't bad at all considering you get 10 packs (2$ each) and 5 event tickets.  Not sure why so many negative reviews, the mechanics here are great.  It's very deep and rewarding.  I'm guessing people are mad because packs cost money.  I also like the market integration, allows those who want to build a specific deck get the cards they need without relying on pack luck.  

I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys TCGs and can comprehend the fact it is not in any way f2p.  Pretty much like a paper TCG but in digital format.
Great game, but no one will play after a month or so due to the lack of reward. NOTHING. VALVE GIVES NOTHING OTHER THAN THE 10 PACKS YOU BOUGHT UNDER THE PRICE TAG.

Like, do you understand that what keeps people in the game is some level of reward? Not even cards, i mean you could give people cosmetics and that might help a bit. But NOTHING.

------ EDIT --------

Now they changed some cards and added a progression system I'm changing to positive. Hopefully this game will get better.
The game is good. And actually cheap.
First, about the game: it works. Looks good. Supports 21:9 screens. Beautiful soundtrack. Very clever design. Not overwhelmingly complex at all, like it appears to be. Interface is very polished, albeit with some minor problems. Matches are long, but the core gameplay loop follows a new trend were players exchange simple actions, instead of whole turns for each one, and that makes the game way more dynamic. The lanes give an interesting tactical decision making, because sometimes you'll have to decide between going with your plan or changing strategies to leverage some oppoprtunities. And the game is not a clone of Magic or Hearthstone or Gwent, and that is great.

Now, about the price.
At launch, the game costs 80 BRL. This is like buying Slay the Spire twice. 
When you buy the game, you get 5 Event Tickets, 10 packs, and 2 decks that are not incredibly good, but really, not a single card game ever had a good starter deck...
With your starting decks, you can play as much as you want casualy, and even play free Phantom Drafts, which is a game mode where you open packs to create a new deck, play some matches, and then those cards go away.
With the 10 packs, you'll probably open enough excess or rares you don`t want so you could sell them and buy another pack or two as well.
Right now, he most expensive card costs 60 BRL, and since it is a hero, you only need one, not 3 of the same card. Many Magic the Gathering staples cost more than that, and usually you'll want 4 of each card. And no, I'm not talking about legendary relics like the Black Lotus, I mean cards that people actually use on their decks all the time (e.g. Nico Bolas, the Ravager, which was printed for the first time this year and costs 30 USD right now).
According to the discussions on the Artifact community hub, the full collection of cards is costing about 285 USD (at the time of writing this). That's less than a lot of the Standard Format MtG decks. Which is one of the cheapest and most accessible formats of play in that game. Even on the online version, Standard decks can cost above 150 USD.
The main reason for why I always bring MtG up is that, well, the same guy designed both games. But also, the business model of this game is very similar to MtGO, with similar game modes and trading. And just like MtG Arena tried to bring Magic to the casual audiences, with an experience more akin to Hearthstone, Valve is trying to reach a niche audience just like MtGO does (and it works, even with its terrible interface and game client). Of course this game is not for everybody (and I dare say, it surely isn't targeted towards DOTA fans...), but that doesn't mean the game is dead on arrival. 

You should also notice that casual players might not even need those expensive cards, and could play just with whatever cards they get on their initial packs + the cards from the starter decks. Even that way, I don't think the game is expensive. Compare to another (physical) card game I have been playing recently - Star Wars: Destiny.
Here in my town, I have paid 80 BRL for a SW Destiny starter deck. That is, the same price as this game. For a deck that goes beyond the concept of "bad starter decks", as it actually comes with less cards(20) than a valid deck(30). So, you basically *have* to buy packs to turn your starter deck into a legal deck, according to the game rules. At least here in Artifact you get 2 decks that are actually complete.
And many other games by Fantasy Flight follow this model, even the non collectibles. Most of their LCGs Core Sets come with too few of some cards, so you have to buy 3 Core Sets to make really good decks - and then, there's the myriad of expansion packs. You don't have to gamble on random packs, but on the other hand, there are no people selling singles, so you'll be buying packs of 20 cards when you just need one or two of those.

Of course, spending any money is always more expensive than spending no money, but look... I'm old, and I have been playing games since before free-to-play games were a thing. And because of that, I may have some opinions that differ from younger folks that always had free games at their fingertips.
First of all, I don't think I'm entitled to the right of playing every single game I want, at the time I want, and the way I want. It is sad that many people can't afford to play some games, just as I think it is sad that I have to work all day, so I can't grind f2p games to get everything for free. 
And talking about those f2p games... in my opinion, they aren't as free as it looks. Just as I mentioned, you only have so much time in a day, so if you work a lot, you play little, but you get money, so you spend money to skip the grind, but the systems are so convoluted that you end up spending way more than you thought you would. And if you don't spend any money, you grind so much that it almost becomes a job (that you don't get paid for).
But most importantly, I learned that companies and the industry are very intricate systems that gravitate around money. It doesn't matter if you paid directly or if you just raised stats and gave personal information, you are always generating income for them while losing yours in some way, so we should stop thinking that games exist solely because of people that love their crafts and want to entertain us.

And that's why I still play games like Magic, and that's why I want to keep playing Artifact. I love card games, and I understand that every company that makes them, want to take my money in some way, so I chose the give the money to the ones who made the games I like more. And people always *will* spend money in things they don't really need, so I don't blame myself for paying for digital cards, just as I don't judge how other people choose to burn their money.
And I think the monetisation model here is actually way more transparent than other games with microtransactions: it works through the Steam Market, which is used for other transactions for years already; you use money, not virtual currencies (well, except for Tickets), so you always know the real value of what you're buying/selling; even though money on the Steam Wallet never leaves the system (it always worked like this), transactions within Artifact can actually give you money that you could use for other things, like buying games or CS:GO items or cards for badges - this is different than opening lootboxes with items that never give you any return on the investment; the market prices are regulated by the community, Valve just takes a cut; with the market, you can actually avoid the gambling of pack opening and just buy the cards you need. Since the card pool is small, and there are only 3 rarities for cards in boosters, cards shouldn't rise too much in price, as long as people are still opening packs.

Bottomline is: game is good, people want to play it - people can't play it, people bash it because they know it is a good game out of their reach. Tip if you don't have money: leave Artifact alone and go play Path of Exile, best free game ever.
Artifact is great! I super enjoy being able to spend money on cards that I want instead of being beholden to some loot crate ridden Skinner box. I sold a few rares and excess commons on the market and used that to buy a cheap deck with which I went 5-1 on my first Expert Draft. I got another well priced rare in those card packs and sold those on to get more free cards. 

It is much, much cheaper to target a specific competitive deck in this game than it is in games like Hearthstone. When a new Hearthstone expansion releases, they offer a pre-order of 50 card packs. I've bought that preorder 2 or 3 times now, and every time I did, I was disappointed in the results; a huge collection of useless commons, and maybe 1 legendary that isn't very useful. 

In Artifact i loaded a deck list off the internet, and it gave me an exact pricing of how much that deck would cost. This game does have an entry fee, and no way to earn cards for free with a guaranteed method; however, to attain that same deck in Hearthstone I would have to buy a random number of card packs until I got the cards/dust I needed, play every day for a month with an extremely basic deck to earn gold for those card packs, or some combination of both. 

For people who don't want to spend money on digital card games, Hearthstone is great, and those people should keep playing that or similar games like Eternal, or MTGA. But for card game players who don't mind spending a bit of money here and there, when it comes to spending money on a digital card game Artifact is a much better deal. Buy exactly which cards you want, sell off the ones you don't to pay for them, and when you're finished with the game, dump them on all the market to buy whatever game you play next.
I have approx 40h in the Artifact beta. Here is my review. 

In terms of the gameplay, Artifact is interesting and deep. There is a lot to learn and explore. In particular, the bots are excellent: they can be challenging, they are great for testing strategies on, and the ability to give them decks you don't own is awesome. Overall, it is a fun and pollished digital CG experience.

However, in terms of a long term, collection building card game, I have reservations. 

The monetizaton feels very tight. You can only earn prizes from pay-gated game modes. However, those prizes are also quite stingy, hard to obtain, and there is little realistic prospect of grinding out a collection.

After other digital CGs,  like Gwent and MTGA, this is a bitter pill to swallow.

A lot has been made of the free, community modes of play. Sure, you can buy the game and just play with the base cards you have been given, as you can with other games like Hearthstone. The problem is, that is NOT where the fun comes from in CGs. The fun comes through aquiring new cards, experimenting, and novelty. Artifact totally lacks that. As a result, it is a less compelling experience. 

In my opinion, Artifact needs some kind of collection progress via play. No, I am NOT talking about hours of grinding; I am talking about fair rewards for normal playing patterns (like in MTGA or Gwent). 

Instead, Artifact has the secondary market (there is no dusting/crafting system). I actually enjoyed playing the market a bit today. In the end, I clawed back roughly 80% of the money I had spent on keeper drafts in the beta, which is pretty surprising (I have a substantial collection for close to $20 AUD). That said, it was a lot of work, some risk taking, and I know the cards well, so spotting over/undervalued ones was easier. I suspect that most players would prefer some form of less speculative, F2P progression. 

Lastly, the game lacks any ranked ladder or MMR to aim for, or cosmetics to earn. Valve have said that they are working on this though, so that will make the game more compelling.  

In conclusion, Artifact is certainly $20-worth of fun, even if you don't venture into the market and constructed play. I am optimistic that Valve will address some of the concerns of the commuity Re. progression and collection building. In the past, they have been very quick to respond to community feedback.
For anyone concerned about the cost/monetization in Artifact. I wanted to correct all the misinformation I'm seeing in the reviews so people can make a purchase decision based on real information. I'll leave other reviews to talk about the actual gameplay.

I've seen tons of claims that Artifact is crazy expensive, and they do this by quoting that a single Hero, Axe, is currently $20 on the marketplace. What they fail to mention is the average price of a card is closer to $0.1 dollars. Yes that's 10 cents. You can comfortably build a completely custom deck from scratch for a few bucks. Axe is an outlier. I actually counted how many cards in the entire game are currently selling for more than $1. I counted only 32 out of the 280 cards in the game.

Addtionally, you don't need to buy a single card to play. There are two modes that allow you to play with every card in the game for free. The first is Phantom Draft, where you create a temporary deck with free packs and use it to play a series of matches. Then there's the event mode, "Call to Arms", where you can play with 6 pre-constructed decks which show you a huge variety of cards and play styles. It says this event is currently featured till Mid-Dec so the assumption here is they will rotate in new pre-constructed decks every so often.

I also see people claiming the only way to play ranked is by paying. This is false. There is a free ranked global matchmaking for constructed decks. The only difference between the free and paid version is you can win packs if you enter the paid version. Both the free and paid ones are ranked play. All the paid modes are also available as free modes which are identical except for not having prizes.
It's a shame that so many people dislike this game. It says a lot about the society we are living in, because Artifact is worth it's 20 dollars, even if you don't buy more cards.

I have played for about 8 hours now, and have not even opened my boosters, nor do I plan to. I can understand, if you play constructed, you are entering P2W terrain, because better cards mean more chances to win, but except for some bot matches the first day, I have only played the free phantom draft. It's a great game mode, where you need skill in drafting AND skill in game.
Best TCG. Everything Valve makes is the greatest in the genre, Artifact is no exception. Valve is very aware of the community and will release patches to please us. They also actively nerf and buff the actual cards so the game as a whole will try to become as balanced as possible. Also as a MTG player I prefer the open market system and have no problems with the relatively low card prices.
Artifact is a very well-thought game and a fresh addition to the card game market. My initial concern is that it would be a pay-to-win game like any other card games out there, but you actually get a lot of play modes for free - including Draft Mode (arena-like mode for those familiar with Hearthstone), a casual Constructed mode for those collecting cards and the Call to Arms, a featured seasonal mode that you can play with any of 5 pre-built decks and build your streak until your first loss.

The game still has much to improve:
- Adding a Ranked Constructed mode, so you can see your skill level in actual numbers;
- Adding a Profile tab, so you can see your past matches, as well as adding a Replay Function,  to watch your games and learn from your mistakes;
- Adding some rewards and progression features, like rewards for playing decks of a certain color or daily wins quests, so you can technically build your collection for free (since you've already paid for the game - make these cards not marketable if it concerns messing with the economy);
- Adding a direct trade funcionality, so you can actually trade cards with friends instead of relying only on the market;
- Adding more interaction with the opponent, wether it is direct chatting or emotes, as well as the option to disabling them if they are being annoying.

That being said, the game really surprised me, considering a lot of other card games I've played before. It's fun, it's competitive, it has a lot more strategy involved and you don't really need to know about Dota in order to enjoy it - although veteran players will enjoy the amazing job they did on porting the familiar Dota heroes to this card game. I've never played a card game with such close matches before, where both players are about to win the game but a single decision (or mistake) will decide the outcome. The game is still very new, so I'm confident they will bring some of these changes to life and make even more improvements to this already fantastic game.
Amazing card game, been waiting for a new fresh card game like this ever since I got tired of MTG and Hearthstone.

The strategy is deep, with lots of outplay potential and interesting ways to play with all the different colors and their different heroes in your deck. By far the most interesting card game I've played in a long while. Games can turn at any time, so you are required to pay a lot of attention on the board!

Monetization model is also the best I've ever seen in a online TCG. People who say the model is a problem don't really realize what a blessing it is. Cards can cheaply and very easily be bought/sold, how many of each you'd like, and even if building a highly competitive deck is your goal, it's way way cheaper than what you'd have to put into similar games like MTG and Hearthstone. Yes, you can grind for cards in Hearthstone and the newly released MTG Arena, but the grind is very slow (and not very fun, unless you bring out your credit card) and if you want to play more than one competitive deck you are still going to have to open random packs, and HOPE you get the right card. Here in Artifact? Just buy the single cards you need, and most of the competitive cards aren't even that expensive. Every Hero with their signature cards take up a lot of space in your deck, so the actual extra cards you have to get are not that many, and many deck archetypes are super cheap.

Plus, there is a completely FREE drafting mode in this game, unlike any other online TCG I've ever seen. So there's unlimited value just in that mode. You can pretty much just buy into the game, and just play casual draft forever. No more money required.

If I'd ever wanna quit the game someday, I can just sell all the cards in my account and get some of the money back. Can I ever do that with Hearthstone? Nope, all the money I wasted on that game is forever lost on my blizzard acc, never to be returned.
So far an enjoyable game. Ability to use my money in targeted fashion rather than grind or roll the dice only is also appreciated. While I may not invest a significant amount into buying individual cards or packs, anything to avoid grinding for effectively pennies per hour is appreciated.
[b]TL;DR[/b] It's actually pretty good. If you didn't know, the game was updated to reward players with free packs and arena tickets which is a major plus to consider, even though it probably should have been like that on launch.

Coming from Hearthstone as my only 'real' card game experience so I will frequently compare the two games in my review. I was originally planning to completely avoid this game because it seemed to have a ton of rng and required constant payment after the $20 to buy the game. But after deciding to get it with a friend and playing for a little while, I'm really starting to like it and I'm probably quitting Hearthstone now. One of the best things about Artifact is that you can buy whatever cards you want. Yes, of course, you are spending real money. But most of the cards cost 5 cents and are still good playable cards in constructed. Even the most expensive cards have been falling in price and most of them are heroes anyways which means you'll only need one copy. Spending $40 on Hearthstone just to get a couple crap legendaries has nothing on this.

Now for the dreaded RNG, it's actually implemented pretty well. To my surpise, (most of) the RNG in Artifact is less of just dumb luck that decides games and more of something you can adapt to and change your strategy based upon. For example, before each turn two melee creeps will spawn randomly, however, the game will tell you ahead of time where they have been chosen to spawn. This allows you to play around what is going to happen to at least some degree and actually makes for an interesting mechanic. On top of that, RNG events like this usually don't have strictly better outcomes. Maybe the melee creeps didn't spawn in the lane you were pushing, they will still get in the way of your opponent's units in other lanes to potentially stall out. Maybe your hero died on turn 1 before you could do anything, well now they'll come back on turn 3 and allow you to swing the game back. Though there are a few examples of badly implemented RNG, most of the cards have a lower power level on average which disincentivizes players from using them in competitive decks. (One of the only powerful RNG cards got changed to no longer be random!)

Not only does the game have a lot more depth and meaningful decisions, but the gamemodes do too. Coming from someone who avoids arena completely, the Hearthstone alternative to deck drafting, Artifact draft actually interests me and takes A LOT more skill. Not just from the actual gameplay, but how the drafting/deck-building system itself works is endlessly more skillful. Essentially you pick two cards at a time from 5 twenty card "packs" that other players will then pick from the remaining cards. There is no wait or anything, there is just a pool of x card packs and you get one at random. This system means you have way more cards to pick from and you will draft excess cards that you then use to make your deck of at least 40 cards. (15 hero 'signature' cards and 25+ main deck) Obviously this lets you to avoid using unwanted cards and allows you to actually use deckbuilding skills instead of just hoping to not draw the trash cards you inevitably get stuck with in Hearthstone. The fact that drafting is cards of any color as opposed to just getting cards from the hero you pick beforehand as in Hearthstone also alliviated some balance issues where certain classes are just going to be better than others. In Artifact, packs you pick from come from other players so no matter what end up being strong, it will sort of balance itself because 'weaker' colors will be more plentiful in packs while more popular will be more scarce as other players will snatch all their stronger cards. 

Overall I think the strengths of Artifact greatly exceed the price of the game. Unless you are dedicated to not spending a single cent on a card game, Artifact is a much better option than Hearthstone for any kind of player. It's so nice to be able to just build any obscure deck you want. Because cards are sold on the market, their price is almost solely determined by how competitively viable they are, so meme tier fun decks are going to cost almost nothing. No more worrying about screwing myself over because I want to craft an off meta deck in Heathstone. Good riddance, I've finally found something better.
Hey! This game is kinda complex, its not cheap and the matches are kinda long.
If you want to play construted you will need to buy cards using the Steam Market or Buyin Packs.
If not, just play draft.
So.. knowing this, buy the game or dont.. 
For now, I am enjoing it and recommend.
Artifact is essentially a turn-based Dota 2 and is actually a very well made game. Yet it's not a game that people expected from Valve so people vent out their frustration in negative reviews using the monetization as a scapegoat.
In reality, Artifact has a fair and clear monetization, and unlike many other CCG(-like) games with their misleading schemes:
[list]
[*] It doesn't mimic a free game and has an upfront cost.
[*] It doesn't manipulate you with dailies/weeklies/etc. with worhtless rewards to trick you into investing as much time into it as possible. Instead you play when you feel like it.
[*] There is no grinding.
[*] Collecting cards is optional and the game has many modes where you choose one of many balanced pre-made decks (or open phantom booster packs for free), and there are no limits on playtime or other limits.
[*] It is not a P2W game. Collecting all the cards won't make you a powerful player so you can't compensate your lack of skill with money. Whaling in this game is meaningless.
[/list]
The gameplay itself is really amazing. Maybe the best card game there is.

There are a few drawbacks though which I feel limits the audience and hopefully get addressed in the future:

1. you can't trade or gift cards to friends. 
I understand that this is the case to prevent side monetizion of gambling sides but for me this is a key motivation to get my friends into the game.

2. No help in building a deck
Deck building is quite difficult. Ofc that's half of what makes you a good player but the game itself doesn't help you much with it. Of course you buy the missing cards for one of the 5 pre-authored decks but that can be up to ~$30 depending on your initial booster packs which come with the game.

For me th gameplay itself so far makes up for these two and I see the latter point being addressed by fan sites using the Web-API of th game but the first really is a pity. 


P.S. Runs superb on SteamOS/Linux - tbf I would not expect anything less from a Valve game =)
Game is fun. There are ways to play with constructed decks of cards you dont really own, so you can play and have fun. the games are exciting and it's a rush of what will happen next and preparing to be undefeatable. If you are into card games, do give it a shot.

My only request is to trade cards with friends, as going through the market means you can;t just trade with friends after opening packs.

It could also use some extra chat features while in a match. I feel too disconected from my oponent if I am playing agaisnt a stranger.
Pro: Good Game Design
       No daily quest BS play just to have fun
       Loving the art style
       Really Really Fun
      Nice lore
Doggy soundtrack

Con: GOES ON 50% OFF AFTER ONE WEEK ALL ME MONEY WASTED
Never cared for card games (digital or physical), but this one is very good. Super polished, building decks is fun, draft is fun, gameplay loop is fun, depth is there, player market for buying/selling cards is fun. Satisfied with my purchase ($20 for the game which came with 5 card packs, and $15 to build two decent decks.)

I agree with the monetization model overall, however, I think the base game should be free. Gotta get more players in. 

It needs a progression system of some sort. Some sort of level system + cosmetic rewards (board skins, card back skins, etc...), especially for those who don't want to buy into the competitive mode. 

The only frustrating RNG piece is the spawning of creeps at the beginning of each round. Players should be able to control what lane they deploy to.

If you're an adult with a job who doesn't have 500 hours to grind out a game for the chance to get a single card you want, this is a great choice. You can go directly to the player market, buy the cards you need for your deck, crack open a Busch Light, and go to town. Amen, 10/10
TL;DR - don't be a negative-review dummy, play the Draft modes. One of the best card games yet

The way Valve is monetizing this game is mostly only perceptively terrible if the company would just start calling this a card game rather than a collectible card game. And most of the people jumping on the negative review bandwagon just can't think for themselves. The only time pay-to-win becomes a factor is in the Constructed Deck game mode where you create a deck from the cards you actually own, but seriously, who the F wants to play this old-fashioned boring-af Constructed mode when Valve offers the Casual Draft Deck modes which first of all offers access to *the entire collection of cards*, which doesn't play singly towards the current meta of a patch, forces true competitive understanding of *all* cards in order to make the best of what's available in the draft, and is actually way more random and interesting. And if you're actually skilled enough, then you pay to play the Expert modes which buys a free Expert mode entry ticket on your 3rd win provided you don't lose 2 games prior, and additional new packs of cards for each subsequent win. A player learns way less of the game from playing (and complaining about) the pay-to-win Constructed mode that they're a sucker who deserves to be losing their money in CCG's to begin with.
very fun and interesting card game, divisive monetization model but pretty low cost compared to most hobby games and doesnt require you grind/rely on luck through lootboxes or card packs to get the cards you need for constructed modes. even early in the game's life card costs are pretty low and you can build exactly the deck you want for a handful of dollars - try doing that in hearthstone or shadowverse or whatever (you can't. you will buy a billion card packs or grind fruitlessly for weeks to try and fill out your collection without any control over what your collection actually is)

really complex and dense but strategically interesting with cool tactical elements - it really is like a tabletop version of dota 2 but without relying on bad teammates

plethora of free game modes for the kitchen table experience, including free drafting modes - it seems very possible to play this game casually and enjoy it immensely without much more than the initial cost of entry (20 dollars, which gets you 2 preconstructed decks and 10 card packs - which if you were to buy piecemeal in game is quite a more expensive than that)

cool game if you like card games/dota/complex tabletop strategy games
The game is pretty solid, has interesting mechanics that differentiate it from other card games, and one of the big deals about it is that it has a market. It is a TCG after all. 
Most people seem to be upset about this, and complain that there is no way to earn cards for free. While that is true, that's also been the case for all physical TCGs. If you're having trading in the game, you can't afford to give stuff out for free, or you'll crash the market. Even so, Artifact allows you to play Phantom Drafts for free, a mode where you get no rewards but you still get to draft yourself a deck from 5 different packs. There's no actual need to pay more than the 20$ entry price.
If you're into constructed, sure, it can cost you a bit to get ALL the cards. But that's not really a necessity. Most cards you only need 3 copies of, heroes needing 1 copy of. Most cards sell for well under 50 cents, a good chunk even below 10 cents. Decks consist of 49 cards (15 of which come with heroes, so you only need 35). Compared to all TCGs around, the price to get a competitive deck is not that high. Currently there are only 3 expensive heroes on the marketplace, and the price is only going to drop as more and more people open packs and sell their excess on the marketplace. The monetization may seem harsh, but it really is rather friendly, if you have access to the market. Buying specific cards ends up being a lot cheaper than getting packs, and you don't even have to rely on chance.
Overall, I do believe people are overreacing to the price of everything.
I have been playing cardgames for 20 years and so far this is the best one. its not perfect yet but im sure valve will get there if they just keep doing these updates! I strongly recommend trying this out
Easily the deepest and most skill-rewarding traditional TCG/CCG on the market. If you are a hardcore strategy fan, this game will be hard to beat.

Gameplay Features:
* 3 lane system means there are always decisions to be made when allocating resources.
* Relative to similar card games, the 3 starting mana in Artifact, and 2 new cards drawn per turn means that the action and decision-making starts right away, rather than taking multiple turns to ramp up (if at all).
* Since the game rewards in-game skill tremendously, the netdecking problem is diminished. Bring the player, not the cards.
* It is still very much a traditional card game with a deep deckbuilding experience, and remarkably so for an inaugural set.
* Extremely polished client with day-1 support for countless ways to play, including player-made formats and tournaments and a variety of free or for-stakes matchmaking modes.

Not for you if:
* You are an extrinsically-motivated gamer; you need progression features and other carrots-on-sticks to remain interested in a game.
* You don't want to invest money and time in learning a deep new game.
Absolutely great game. Haven't gotten better than 2-2 in drafts, but still had fun playing it. The base cost was enough for 2 decks, one semi expensive at ~5€ and one cheap one at about 2€. I haven't played constructed except against a friend, been incredibly fun so far.

Meanwhile I've spent 300€ in Hearthstone and have one functioning deck, because I like trying new things. While in HS I need to disenchant and enchant cards effectively quartering their worth, in Artifact you just sell them for a small fee and get the cards you want to play. Or pay a fraction of the cost for HS/artifact packs and just buy the best cards. Axe + 3 Time of triumph for example is currently sitting at ~35€. Really not much if you compare it to HS.

If you're looking for F2P then play Shadowverse, much better in that regard. But if you have the 20 bucks it's easily worth it.
I know that there have been a ton of negative reviews for this game, but it actually is really fun.

DISCLAIMER:

A lot of people seem to be comparing this to hearthstone / other free-to-play games, which is the problem I think. I hate micro-transactions in games as much as the next person, but if you have ever played a REAL card game before, ei: magic, pokemon, yu-gi-oh, what have you, this is how these games are played, except with this one, you don't have to buy endless packs to get the card you want; most cards on the marketplace are $0.05 with an exception to some very rare/good cards. 
Rare cards have ALWAYS been expensive in card games and honestly, I'm not that surprised that this is the way they chose to do things since they literally partnered with Magic: the Gathering creator to make this game.

If you're unsure whether to buy this game because you're used to Hearthstone/free-to-plays: Don't buy it, it's not trying to be Hearthstone and you're probably going to be upset with how much more difficult it is to get card packs. Also, If you never spend money in Hearthstone like me, remember how long you had to grind to get those meta cards you wanted, and getting absolutely destroyed by frustratingly expensive decks? This game feels way more balanced and even if players have great cards, it's still possible for you to win. A lot of my games have been so close, I was sitting on the edge of my seat. It is a fun game.

If you have played Magic or other card games and would like to see something new and interesting: Buy. I cannot recommend this game enough, and despite its card pack issue (which I believe Valve will update because they're typically pretty good with customer support) it's a fun game. Bought it on release and I can't stop thinking about it :)

If you really want to: put $5 in your steam wallet and buy some cards that look fun to you! I sold most of my cheap skins in cs:go, as well as crates that I'm never going to open. You can also sell cards that you don't want or recycle them.
I don't usually write reviews, but the huge amount of negative reviews convinced me otherwise.

I played HS for many years and MTGA for a while.

Most complaints seem to be about the monetization model. This is like complaining about a game genre; "I don't like this game because this is a hero shooter". This is the same as saying that "I don't like Artifact because it's a TCG". You bought a TCG and you got a TCG, complaining about this makes no sense whatsoever. If this was a CCG like every other card game then I would understand, but it's not.

The game is great. I haven't had this much fun in any game in a long time. There are many game modes and even casuals will get their worth of fun, even without spending any money past the initial purchase. The complexity and depth of choice making is what will keep people playing.
I was so against the entry price, which is kinda high if you consider that you have to pay for all the cards you want to add to your collection. But if you think of it, don’t you buy your cards to play mtg or any other card game in real life?  Honestly, I couldn’t expect that I would enjoy this game, especially after playing a lot of Hearthstone and Magic Arena(which are great games). 

The mechanics and the amount of choices you have to face in Artifact is something completely new, that I have never seen in any cards game before. It’s way more strategic than just build a good deck and pray for the strong creature to come up and cast. 

If you like card games, give it a go. It’s expensive-ish to get competitive and takes some time to learn it but, if you try it, you may end up enjoying this as much as me. 


[b]I'm a 32 year old soon-to-be father and I just stayed up til 3 a.m. playing this game. Slept for less than 4 hours and hopped back on.[/b] I haven't had a game grip me this tight in a [i]looong[/i] time. 

Artifact is intimidating in comparison to most other TCG's. There is a lot going on and keeping up with three different battlefields can get confusing. I was not expecting Artifact to be such an in-depth and difficult card game. 

[h1]Where I'm Coming From[/h1] 
I grew up playing card games. I was in deep with Magic the Gathering during middle school. I dabbled with the Pokemon card game. My friends and I went to Dragon Ball Z card tournaments almost on a weekly basis. I bought into the HEX TCG that was on Kickstarter. Slay the Spire has currently been my obsession. It might be the greatest deck builder ever made. I will fight you on that. Yes [i]you[/i]. However, I never touched Hearthstone. I've also never played DotA. I can't get into MOBA's, not my thing.

[h1]Monetization[/h1] 
The Steam Market and how you obtain cards is a controversial topic right now, and I'm here to say that I actually enjoy it. Maybe it's because I am an avid gamer and my Steam account is 13 years old, so I had a ton of items in my inventory to sell. I went thru and sold a bunch of CS:GO skins I didn't want, I sold damn near everything I had in TF2. I had duplicates of Steam Cards from other games, wallpapers..  all kinds of little things. It all added up. Coupled with the fact that most cards in Artifact are around .04 to .30 cents, it's super easy to get a good bedrock of decent cards that [i]you chose[/i] right at the beginning. [b]The beauty and accessibility of the Steam Market really shines in Artifact.[/b]

[h1]Missing Some Key Ingredients[/h1] 
That being said, I still think Valve should implement some sort of in-game currency that you can grind out. There needs to be an option for the average joe to obtain cards without paying cash or being really good and winning matches right off the bat. That's how you grow your playerbase and lower your whales.  

We also desperately need some sort of Progression System. The matches themselves are extremely fun, but then there's almost nothing to do afterwards. It kinda feels lonely without a Profile Identification and in-game Chat. Even though I will praise the Steam Market for doing a lot of good for the game, some cards are extremely expensive and have deterred players from the game. This doesn't particularly bother me though, it really doesn't. If you are familiar with card games, then you know this is how just about all TCG's work. 




[h1]Summary[/h1] 
Artifact is dauntingly complex upfront, with a friendly and addictive personality once you get to know it. There are just so many interesting decisions to make every turn. With Valve and Richard Garfield behind this project, I strongly believe Artifact will last for decades as one of the best Card Games online.
Recommended? Yes and no. 

Yes: If you want to enjoy Dr Garfield's mechanics and a game with really interesting game play, pay your $20 and get into it. For your $$ you get 10 packs (normally $1.99) AND 5  tickets ($1.00) The best upside of Artifact is you can play with just what you have but the biggest downside is if you want to play competitive constructed (or even social constructed) you will need to engage with the marketplace to buy the cards you want for your deck. This isn't all a bad thing. You can buy many cards (some very powerful uncommons like Luna and Zeus for example) for mere fractions of a $1.

No: If you, like myself, refuse to give Steam your phone # (and have no smart phone to use their app with anyway), you will find selling more expensive cards a ridiculous waste of time. Yes you can sell your cards on the marketplace but they arbitrarily decide what amounts are "OK" and which are not. For example, I was fortunate enough to open one of the more expensive heroes (Drow Ranger) but Steam is holding it without letting me sell it for 3 weeks. "For my own safety" even though they let me sell small value cards ($4 or so in value). 

Similar to the Steam refund policy this "give us your phone or we hold your marketplace items hostage" serves them, not us. Most people will probably just shrug and give up their phone security. For myself, since I don't own even a smart phone but a star trek flip phone (aka a burner), I can't engage in the market until Valve has properly punished me for not toeing their line. I would not mention this in this review except that it direct impacts the way I can play the game or not play the game. 

Since Constructed play depends on build decks purchased on the Steam Marketplace, or by buying random packs (also through Steam) and hoping for the best, the game essentially ties your ability to fully enjoy the game to engaging their marketplace. Which imho is the very essense of a monopolistic approach. So if this bothers you don't buy it. 

If there was a maybe button this game would be right in the middle because of the above mentioned issues. The rest of the game is amazing,  and while visually a little dull (I am not a fan of animations or tiny artwork (I'd love to see cards with full art -- ala m:tg promos, etc)) it still manages to be very fun. Particularly fun to kibitz with friends as they make mistakes and get completely turned around in the game and then finally win through ingenious plays despite always feeling like being on the backfoot. 

Verdict: Yes (but only because there is no "maybe").
With Valve recently introducing skill ratings, a progression system and most importantly changing their stance on card balance, I can happily recommend this game for all card game enthusiasts.
Definitely the best card game I've played.  Over 100 hours in already, and its just getting more fun.  Some appear to not like the monetization, but I like it quite a lot and I already have all the cards for a tiny fraction of the cost that it would take to do that in Hearthstone etc.
Pretty fun card game especially if you enjoy Dota lore. You can play 'f2p' after buying the game by playing casual game modes. Can play draft if you don't have a big card collection, would recommend playing casual phantom draft first to get used to deciding the good cards from the bad cards, then use your tickets to play 'expert' phantom draft. This way if you get to 3 wins you get a ticket back, therefore going infinite, and anymore wins after that (up to 5) you get an additional pack or 2 packs respectively. 

HOWEVER, I do also agree that Valve should add a way for the casual players to receive cards, either through daily/weekly challenges, or giving them a ticket if they go 5-0 or something along those lines.
------------------------------------------------------------
"Casual play" modes are completly FREE
"Expert play" mode is not ranked - you are have to wage ticket & play for rewards (tickets & card packs) vs other players, its more like a tournament, not a RANKED

Ranked has to come later
------------------------------------------------------------

PROS:
------------------------------------------------------------
Even T1 decks are still really cheap if you compare it to T1 decks in HS.
Cost of deck is now 2$~35$
You can duel your friends
You can make own tournaments
DotA lore
Game mechanics & depth
Not so RNG as other card games
Graphics, OST & voice acting
Cost of ticket is 0.2~0.4$ if you recycle cards, where you can win 1-2 card packs (worth 1.75$) & ticket back

-------------------------------------------------------------
CONS:
No ranked yet
No Android support yet
You can't trade cards directly - only sell/buy on community market
Few "combo" cards
You can't watch games of your friends / download replay
I didn't get axe & drow from starter pack

--------------------------------------------------------------
For a digital CCG, it's a very good game.

I don't really think the complaints about the economy are fair, it's not a f2p game and it mimics the real economy of CCGs. You have gamemodes you can play for free, including draft, which is in my opinion the most fun gamemode in the game. I don't really care about creating a collection, so I bought the game and sold like 8 cards for more than the game was worth, so even made money on it, but the money could be used to buy other cards. The prices of the cards will probably go down once the market saturates a bit.

As far as the game itself goes, it's amazing. The writing for the lore is pretty interesting, the audiovisuals of the game set a very deep atmosphere of the Dota world. The gameplay is very interesting for a card game, as there are different mechanics to spike up the experience - namely playing on three lanes like in Dota, making decks based on heroes, items and then one of the four colors' cards.

Overall, I'd recommend this game to anyone interested in Dota and/or card games. Playing the game actually feels very fun and entertaining.
If you come to games as a casual hobby or to veg out, Artifact probably [i]isn't[/i] for you. There are a bunch of barriers to entry. It's moderately expensive (though with the caveat that you can eventually cash out). The rules engine has so much going on that it takes time to even understand what's happening – let alone before you can evaluate whether any given decision was correct. Those decisions are immensely impactful, however, so even savvy players can find themselves getting stomped for a while.

With all that said, Artifact's gameplay has the potential for absurd depth simply based on the core rules. You constantly have to keep in mind what's going on in three lanes and make judgments on which lanes to commit resources to, often based on what you predict will happen several turns down the line. As someone who loves taking deep dives into games, rather than enjoying a game for a while then moving on, that's ideal. Artifact has some rough edges right now, but that's to be expected given that it's the very first set of a TCG. Given Valve's history of polish, chances are good that future sets that come down the pipeline will turn Artifact into a mainstay for serious-minded competitive gamers.
It's very frustrating to see all of the complaints about how Artifact requires to much money. Compared to any other serious card game this is by far the cheapest. 

1) You can easily make a viable deck for $10 or less. You don't have to buy Axe, Legion Commander or Kanna. I just won an entire competitive gauntlet with a monoblack deck without the expensive cards and that netted me another competitive ticket and two packs, one of which mind you dropped Kanna which I got to sell for a quick $10. I had to defeat three decks that contained Axe and Legion Commander to do this and I HAD. 

2) You can buy the cards you want directly from the Steam market. This is by far cheaper than opening packs and hoping (HS fuck off).

3) You can play casual drafts for free when ever you want. No other game provides this. It is the most fun game mode and will more likely be considered more competitive than constructed. 

4) To complete the entire set we're looking at most likely 130-150 USD when market fluctuation settles. I have had long time MTG and HS players go on about how much of a relief that is to them that they won't "have to spend all that much money" to complete the set.  

This game isn't a scam. These reviews are being flooded by people who didn't take the time to see what this game is about and actually think you aren't going to have a viable deck without the top most expensive cards. Thats just flat out wrong and anyone who plays card games knows thats a new player mentality. I am defeating so many of these decks stacked with "OP" cards.

In terms of actual game play I really love this as a card game. It takes elements of MOBA's and introduces it into a card game so well that you can play MOBA strats to win a game. After all, the general premise is the same: There are three lanes with objectives. Destroy the objectives. Killing anything on the way nets you gold for items that will help you. 

The cards over all feel very balanced. I feel that Green as a whole is a tad, TAD,  weak. However, when mixed with other colors or played in draft is actually very strong. I just wouldn't recommend mono-green in constructed.
So there are two reviews for this game, one being that your best card is your credit card and the other being that it's actually super cheap and only a few cards are expensive. Personally I think there should be a system for grinding towards new cards because there are multiple decks I want to try but they cost around $60 each with all the cards. Now those are just some premades that I saw looked interesting. There is always the phantom draft mode where you and your opponent are on equal grounds no matter what, but since I'm more of a casual I like the constructed better. Other than the deck making and that junk the gameplay is amazing, i genuinely love this game and reccomend the game but hate the card system. Chances are valve will end up changing it or make a battle pass of some sort to help out the casuals. Until then I'll just stick to my two basic decks I got with the game.
First a bit about the game itself - mechanic wise it's refreshing and with a lot of depth that many digital cards games lack these days - you can't just put it in one basket with HS or Legends. But be ready for games that take hour or more.

And now about the economy/business behind the game:
A lot of uneducated people post negative reviews - I got that some people don't like it's not free, that you don't get all cards handed for free by Gaben himself, that you can't grind  daily quests for months to get that "free" cards (if you don't value your time). Cmon... it's actually one of the cheapest TCG/CCG to quickly acquire cards, there is already plenty of pauper tournaments incoming for people that want to spend max few bucks for cards. You can create your own tournaments for free if you don't want to spend $ at all. You can even play draft for free whenever you can.
So far, I love it. Music is absolutely great, gameplay has a lot of depth and strategy, the added lore is very cool for a long time dota player like me. 
I was dissappointed at first when Valve announced artifact during TI7, but eventually I got really hyped up because it looked interesting, had new heroes that DoTA 2 hasn't seen yet. Artifact is really a healing salve to the slowly dying Card-Game genre, this game gave life to that genre for me atleast. I've been playing againts my friends a lot of games and we're really enjoying it. It's a shame though that (Quote:"The most powerful card in this game is your credit card.")

Will update the review once I get more hours in.
This game is PERFECT mechanically. It is a beautiful blend of Magic-like depth (actually deeper than Magic in many respects) and Hearthstone-esque lightheartedness. It's beautiful, bright, and smooth as a game that has been out and patched for years on end. You can think turns upon turns in advance, and each match feels like a true battle of the wits with VERY LITTLE RNG. I thought this game looked confusing after watching the YouTube previews, but my God is it fun and intuitive once you play it. 
I literally never review games, but given all the flak this game has received for its "monetization" (AKA what every game ever has sought to do, make money), I decided to post. If you don't want the game, then DON'T BUY IT. If you don't want to spend money on packs, THEN DON'T SPEND IT. Quit tanking a game's review score because you are mad that it was made by a private company which seeks to make money. In fact, by all means, take all my money if it means you produce more beautifully smooth content like this one. Artifact is a gem, truly, and it's the exact slow paced strategy game I have been looking for lately since my brother rages so hard I can't play shooters or MOBAs with him anymore. 

Thanks Valve <3
I dont really get this whole monetization drama. By buying Artifact, you have decent chance to get your money back by dropping cards that you wont use anyway if you have any idea what your playstyle is. It is very good game, which allows you to play UNLIMITED casual Phantom Drafts, and when you are good, you only need 1 ticket to play Expert Phantom Drafts and you will keep going naturally like arena in Hearthstone. Sure, you have to spend money to get constructed cards that you want, but it is the same way like in any other traditional TCG
A very deep, complex, challenging, cerebral, yet rewarding experience. Pretty easy to get the basics, but a lot to grasp, understand, and employ to master. Really enjoy the connection to the DotA 2 lore and universe, and how the two games play off of each other. It feels more like they are intertwined and help drive each others respective stories, as opposed to other games in the genre. You can really get a feel for the MTG influences and drive behind Artifacts creation, which is a great quality. Love how unique you can make decks, the color combinations and playstyles are varied, refreshing, and stand out from one another. Only thing the game is missing is a progression system in my opinion. For those who like to be challenged, apply strategy, and forethought, this is the ideal card game out there.
Artifact is the brilliant brainchild of Magic: The Gathering's Richard Garfield and Gabe Newell. Deck theory has never been more fun to me than with this game. Deckbuilding, Phantom Draft, Casual Tournaments, In-Game Glossary, Chess Timer -- This is the game future online card games will emulate for years to come. You must try this out.
If you are a Dota player and got sick of the TOXIC Dota community but you want to play a game that is Dota themed (inspired), then this game is the best option for you especially if you have a card game history.

The Gameplay:-
The game is unique in terms of gameplay, introducing the moba concepts to the card game genre created so interesting experience, this is the first card game where draft is taken so seriously to level where it become the main mode instead of constructed that is more of a tournament mode, the game have a strong lore on it that work side by side with Dota lore and all the cards have lore in it, when it comes to overall complexity then your gaming history do effect how you view the level of complexity, if you ask Dota/MTG/Gwent players they will mostly tell you it’s not that much complex but if you ask hearthstone players then they will tell you it’s so complex.

Graphic and Audio:-
This game have the highest graphic and animation quality, but not the highest card art quality plus there is no foil/golden version of the cards (may be better for the market) which is still good but not the best compared to the other digital card games.
The game audio is great wither it’s the soundtrack or the voice lines and cards interactions, the interactions have very interesting lore driven voice lines that can make people more interested about the lore even the ones who’s not familiar with the Dota lore.

Business Model:-
OK, now this is the most controversial topic about the game, long story short after the first update during the beta everything become way much better after they added the casual phantom draft gauntlet and the recycle system, people fail to see that its TCG and not CCG and they keep demanding grind system with free rewards even though Valve made it clear since the first conference at 9-march-2018 that the game will not give free rewards so it don’t devalue the cards on the market and its TCG not CCG, you still can get free rewards if you do good at the expert gauntlet, in the end of the day you don’t need to buy any cards or tickets for phantom draft (the main mode) and you only need rare cards for constructed (the tournament/high competitive mode) and the cards are really so cheap compared to all the speculations people did, its either the TCG steam market with no grind system or the CCG dust/grind system without the steam market.

e-Sports:-
It’s still too early to judge but it’s so clear that this game aim to become the biggest card game e-Sport, the game have in-game tournament system and all regions are combined together so you can play in any region with your collection unlike other games where each region have its own, which is great since the genre already filled with casual games with no single real e-Sport game from the genre.

The Development Team:-
One of the most things that made me believe on this game despite all the negative reviews is the development team, its full of talented people with good history at game development and they listen, they actually listen to the community as long as the community requests do make sense, and they make very fast updates (Sometimes bugs fixed within 24 hour of its report).

Pretty deep and complex TCG. Instead of huge walls of texts with multiple abilities, Artifact's cards are mostly simple and intuitive, but using them correctly in every situation is what defines a really good player. Matches can take a bit too long, but they're usually intense and as close as they can be, sometimes even resulting in a tie.

Now, is it worth that much? If your country's currency is doing well, I'd say 'yes.' But if you're from South America, Russia etc, this game is likely too expensive, especially if you're into competitive Constructed. Since I'm Brazilian, I'm not even sure I would've bought it if I hadn't gotten a beta key from a giveaway. I literally sold every Rare and Uncommon card I got, which gave me around $20, and I'll only play Draft for now. If competitive decks ever get cheaper, I might consider building one later.

Anyway, as a game, I definitely recommend it. I won't say it's balanced (no IceFrog in this one), I can't say it's gonna get big, but I assure it's the most unique and ingenious card game I've ever seen.
Great gameplay. The negative reviews you're seeing are from people not enjoy the monetization, which is totally fair. Just be aware that this game in its current state is super fun, but will cost you more than your original $20 to play.
This is a superb game with some truly unique ideas and mechanics that set it far apart from many of its peers. I have been and will continue to enjoy my time with it. I can easily recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in the card game genre. 

However it should be noted that the pricing model in this game is far more in line with something you'd find out of a physical card game. This isn't a f2p game, and as such there aren't any f2p methods of griding out currency to buy cards. As of right now, the only method of unlocking cards is to buy packs, buy them off the market place, or win them as prizes in specific competitve play modes that require money to enter. Personally, I don't see an issue with it, but if it's something to be aware of. 

As for the pros:
- The three lane structure of the game really stresses dynamic planning, creative plays, and strict resource managment 
- RNG is unavoidable in a card game, but it's pretty minimal here. Although Cheating Death is somewhat annoying.
- The overall polish and presentation of the game, including art direction and sound, is excellent. 
- If you're at all interested in the lore of Dota 2, then this game is a goldmine. 
- Games rarely feel one sided, and the tides of a match can change in an instant. Don't get comfortable. 
- Marketplace integration makes filling gaps in your decks and collection extremly convenient. 
- Full integration for community driven tournaments. 

The cons:
- The pricing model for some people will be a turn off.
- No real guidance on deckbuilding in game.
- As of launch there is no real progression system, though it is coming.
- Odd lack of social features given how robust Dota 2 is. Hopefully more are coming.

Overall this is an experience quite unlike anything else on the market currently.
There are many ways to play for free, but if you're a card collector you wont get the cards you want without spending some time on the community market. To be honest, even if you add up the cost of the expensive cards, you're still spending less money than on similar digital cardgames (wont even mention collectable ones). In Artifact the most expensive hero costs about 10 euro, the basic ones costing 10 cents; whereas Hearthstone (the biggest TCG) you wont even get half a legendary for 10 euro worth of packs.  

The need to pay for competitive play does make me want to give it a negative vote.....but still, the game is just so well designed and engaging, and animation and music are simply amazing. 
In view thereof, I simply have to recommend trying it out if you're a fan of the genre.
A really great game with a lot of potential. At the moment there is a bit of a lack of progression systems, no doubt in avoidance of damaging the card market, but it is planned to be implemented in some fashion in the future through after player feedback was given during the beta from what I understand. The addition of a free way to play Arena is wonderful and sets Artifact apart from many free to play card games: free Arena means you can practice your decks as many times as you need before heading into the Ticket only mode.

Artifact gives you a load of cards you can sell or translate into Tickets. Tickets let you fight in the competitive Arena allowing you to earn cards as you play (If you win a couple matches each Arena) This means theoretically you could earn cards without ever paying for additional cards but in practice many new players, such as myself, will have a difficult time getting anything out of it. As a suggestion to any interested buyers you should 100% save your tickets for now and practice in the casual matchmaking pool. This will let you get up to speed with Deck Building and the game in general without  losing your Tickets needlessly. This does not replace a pure free progression system but it is something to start out with.

The gameplay and user experience of Artifact is really what sells it for me. The game has an abundance of RNG to the point of limiting the impact of said RNG. The game then revolves around limiting the impact of luck even further in a way similar to Poker. The polish here is clearly visible from the expansive amount of deckbuilding features to the text hints and information bits listed in the description of every card. The descriptions and explanations, as well as history features and deck tracking, are just as abundant as they would be in Dota or any hyper complex MOBA. The gameplay takes some negatives from it's MOBA roots though namely the amount of complex information present. The descriptions I mentioned earlier help somewhat in mitigating this but I think it is very important to know that there is definitely a learning curve to the game.

The market place is one of the most controversial portions of Artifact. In the steam market you can sell and buy cards at varying costs. At the moment the market is somewhat thin and so cards are most likely more expensive than they will be in the future (This is my assumption given how the market has dropped in other Valve titles- The first days of a new item makes it exceptionally expensive). One thing the market has over many other digital cards games such as Hearthstone is that it allows you to buy exactly what you want. This lets you avoid recycling cards in the game for little reward and enables you to completely avoid packs if you would prefer. Valve intends to make card power and price as little connected as possible, from their posts about "500$ decks". It is yet to be seen how Valve will attempt to balance this but it is extremely important as it could make or break the flow of the economy and gameplay for anyone not interested in paying much money past their initial purchase.

Overall I would recommend Artifact if you are interested in a vastly new card game with combat systems that reward skill. If you do not have the time to invest into playing and practicing to win in Arena the game may not be for you in its current state. It is certainly a blast even without buying newer cards and only playing the free modes (I have not bought a card alone yet myself, waiting on the market to set a little) but it can leave something to be desired if you need that satisfaction of building up in a progression system towards new cards. I would suggest waiting on the apparent upcoming progression system. If you're interested in markets, trading, selling, or just feel satisfied with the cards given to you by the base 20$ price though you should absolutely check it out.

I will hopefully update this review as new features roll out, such as progression.
I'm going to be frank. Like most card games artifact was made with the intention of making back its costs and then some. It is, however, a stellar example of the virtual card game genre. Perhaps being the most pleasing card game it also boasts a great number of mechanics. If you're like myself the is quite desirable. Phantom draft is essentially artifact's arena mode except unlike all those other free to play card games there is a casual mode that allows for infinite play at no additional cost. 

The most common complaint for this game is the monetization system valve implimented. This game costs money (I know outrageous right?) but compared to the cost of being up to date for a hearthstone expansion it's cheap. You can also buy the cards that you need directly. Taking all this into consideration i think people are upset due to the death of half life three and as sheeple tend to do when they're upset they bandwagon. 

Overall, stricktly speaking, the game design itself is excellent, you can play casual phantom draft for no added cost, find a deck for constructed and purchase the cards necessary fro a fraction of the cost of other card games, challeng friends and play competively. 

Lets not kid ourselves no one is actually going to grind for all the cards in those other free  card games anyway. Give it a go you'll be suprised.
This game is well worth the 20$ (sold cards got 10 back), i'm cheap and just going to phantom draft untill events. This is actually really good for casual fans of rogue-likes. Casual phantam draft is where you draft a deck from 5 packs (you don't keep cards) and you see if you can win up to 5 game before losing 2. - no reward outside of learning and playing a.k.a. standard rogue-like

What i really like about this is how it doesn't feel like a card game to me as much as a borad game. Most card games i've seen are a card does a thing and lives and dies on its stats. This is more like setting heros on battle fields and using spells and items to kill, heal and cause fucking chaos.
Coming from like 2K+ hours in Dota since 2014, this seems to be the game I actually have been looking for. No crappy teammates to blame, and more feelings of reward. Great integration with Dota heroes, items, and concepts too. Dota feels like a stressful chore compared to this.
I dont play card games much but I am now very fascisnated by artifact. Been playing the draft mode that requires a ticket.

There are many times that I won because I made better decisions and sometimes i was mind blown by my opponents' use of cards which destroyed me in just one crucial turn when i expected least
First pack I opened turned out to be the currently most expensive card...so I guess the game paid for itself

Gameplay wise, its a pretty unique experience of how you can make item purchases for your heroes and have 3 lanes of combat. What you see in gameplays are literally what you should expect. It's much different from the usual online card games out there currently, so if you're looking for a different game other than like heartstone and shadowverse, this is a good switch up. So far though, its looking like you have to invest more money than the original 20 bucks for the game to create a decent deck, but coming from someone who used to play yugioh, I think it's ultimately up to the person playing if they choose to invest in the game or not. IMO I don't think its worth it at the moment, even though it is different and the fact that I literally got an RNG opening that paid the game for me. For some people, 20 bucks isn't much to experience the game, but I highly recommend you keep watching gameplay videos and learn about the game before deciding to make your purchase. Take my thumbs up as a middle ground, as I really like to see this game develop and see its potential, but in its current state it just seems too money hungry.

IMPORTANT: From what I have heard, you can't actually refund the game if you open your 10 free packs, so...just a word of advice if you want to take the gamble and pull a card that pays for the game.
tutorial finished. and i lost horribly. which in a way is amazing to feel and see. this game not only forces you to think about every single move you make. but there are 3 diff. lanes to think about current and future plays. being a looong time dota player. this is exactly what i expected from valve with artifact. super indepth/ critical thinking card game. worth it.
Incredibly deep, way cheaper than any other card game.  Earning "free" packs in other games via relentless grinding etc just makes the cards outrageously expensive for anything competitive.  In artifact it's not unreasonable that you could make a competitive deck for under $2.  Compare that to other games with "free" ways to get cards and tell me how many people actually win games without shelling out money for a single card in MTG or HS that costs as much as a complete set of every card in Artifact.  Games cost money, just be honest with yourself what the real cost of a game is, "free to play" or otherwise; you might be surprised.  

Also food for thought: time is the one resource you can't get more of; you can always make more money.
With all these negative comments I can't help to want to write a review, so here we go

[h1] What is Artifact ? [/h1]

Artifact to me is a refreshing tcg, easy to play, hard to master.
I'll be keeping the 'is it p2w or not' reasoning for last.

For the € 17.95 you get 10 boosters and 5 tickets.
Those 10 boosters is what you'll have to struggle with to make your decks to play constructed.
The boosters are very generous though, 1 guaranteed rare, 3 uncommons, and 6 commons.
In total you receive 96 cards. Of those, to make a playable deck, you need 5 heroes, wich automatically bring 3 signature cards each.
so besides those 5 heroes you get from boosters, you only need 25 more cards to make a deck, plus 9 more to make an item deck.
Considering all this, the free packs they give you is quite generous.

I would suggest testing out different kinds of decks, either by making decks with the cards you own, or playing the [u][b] Free[/b][/u] Phantom draft.
Once you get the hang of things, you can sell the cards you wont use, to try to make the best deck you possibly can.

You get 5 tickets to play 'expert constructed' , wich pits you against other players with their constructed deck.
Once you lose twice, you're out of the running. If you win 3 times however, you get your ticket back. Win a 4th time and you get a booster, win a 5th time and you get another booster ! 

Rinse and repeat, sell the cards you dont need, improve your deck, if you're good enough you can just sell the cards to buy other games ! 

Now I can see where people are complaining about the "hurr durr p2w game" part.
Axe is one of the strongest heroes atm, and also the most expensive card ( around €19 atm). Now if you just play a deck with phantom assassin (wich costs like €0.50 ?), you get the signature card wich just literally destroys a hero.

[b][u] TL;DR [/u][/b]

People who complain about the game being p2w, havent spent enough time exploring the game and just expect free stuff from launching the game daily. 

[b][u]For the casual player:[/u][/b] this game is great fun to play against friends, alot of fun mechanics you can build decks around. you wont get too many cards though if you're not committed to spend hours on crafting your deck, finetuning it and winning boosters with your tickets.

[u][b]For the more dedicated player:[/b][/u] This is a great TCG, you will spend HOURS upon HOURS trying out new decks with all the fun mechanics they offer you to build around. highly recommend it for any fan of the TCG's out there.
Great gameplay and polishing.
Great if you like to play draft.
Good free tounement system.
The only problem is that the only reasonable way to aquire new cards is by buying packs,cards or tickets and they are expensive.
If you are only interested in playing draft then it's a good buy.
If you want to play constructed then you need to be prepared to spend a huge amount of money for the "meta decks".

I need to write a review because I think people lose their heads over the monetization. Yes, you have to pay. No, you don't get free stuff. I bought the game and ten boosters, which is 35€, so less than other games. I sold a few duplicates (none worth more than 0.5€) and bought a couple of cards I needed for my deck with that money. I won the first expert constructed I ever played, without any of the really expensive cards.
Now you are all gonig to say: But Hearthstone, Magic, etc. are free! Yes, they are free, but none of the people who play in the top ranks are F2P. They all buy a lot of cards to be competitive. The only thing Artifact does not do is bait you with the "Free Booster" carrot. Valve is only honest regarding the monetization, other publishers are not (or are publishing mobile games of well-known franchises to make a quick buck).
Even without that carrot I think Artifact is the best card game available (besides Eternal Card Game). It offers a fresh new take on this category of games.
I've been enjoying it, the drafts have been a lot of fun and it's remarkably sustainable once Gud has been Git. Haven't played much constructed yet, but I'm looking forward to doing so, should be fun. The thing that really sets Artifact apart the most I feel is it's less "Two powerful wizards throwing spells at each other" and more "Two shadowy figures watch a battle and ocasionally nudge things" which I enjoy. At first I was worried about some of the RNG elements that they decided to include like creep placement and attack targets, but I've grown to enjoy them. The key difference between its RNG and the bad Hearthstone RNG is the bad RNG is around affecting the actions you take, whereas Artifact's RNG usually doesn't hit your cards (adding stability to your game lines) and is more things to be reacted to. Game plans for both players can drasticaly change multiple times over the course of two turns, which is a lot of fun.
Fun game, easy to understand, but still has a high skill ceiling. 20-30 min matches that could go either way till the very end. Wouldn't recommend it to someone new to the genre, though. Try one of the free games first.

Cost-wise, it's cheap in comparison to most other games in the genre. Sure, you can't grind for free cards, but if you don't care for playing competitively then you can make whatever type of constructed deck you want for 5-10€. If you have any luck with the free packs you get then you can sell the rares, build the deck you want and still have some money left as well. There's a handful of strong cards that you won't be able to get for cheap but you can definitely make do without them. A proper competitive deck would cost you anywhere between 20 and 80€, which is a still fraction of the cost of MTG decks. Alternatively, you could just play the draft mode for free. It's also fun and the matches will often be even more tense.

The balance is in a pretty decent place right now and pretty much every match will be really close, assuming both players have some idea of what they're doing. The bar between a budget deck and a wallet warrior's deck isn't very big, so you can definitely win even with weaker cards. Random effects are pretty rare and there's only one card (cheating death) that's pure RNG you can't really play around.
Ive been waiting for this game ever since it got announced.
Ive played dota for 9 years and magic the gathering for about 22, so knowing Garfield was making a dota card game was a dream come true.

I was not in the beta (EU dancing monkey).

Im around 118h now. 95% of that is draft/limited play.

I STILL LOVE THIS GAME. 
Ive lost games i thought were over; ive won games where I stood almost no chance. I have never felt like I never had any possibility or alternative game line to follow. Due to the nature of the game, you have to make dozens of decisions per game and the overall weight of each decision becomes lessened.

On the other hand, games do require your complete focus, so its definitely not for hearthstone casuals. 

Ive no issues with the game at the moment, I am genuinely happy with my experience, and will likely play this game for a very long time.

The economy is fine if you value your time and want to focus on improving rather than performing pointless quests.

Valve has in the past 3 weeks since launch already impremented vast chat options and progression systems. They are not perfect but are a strong signal to the community that valve is commited to listen to the players and improve this game.

If you like a challenge and like card games, you will want to try this game.
This is really a good game and completely different to prior reviews. But, yes this game enjoyable watching only if u understand this game. And this is really hartd to learn this game without playing persionaly, Whereas, it is easiest card game ever when u plays it. Everything is excellent. Just waiting for some open tournament for artifact as a DOTA player.
This review is about the game mechanics, not the price point. If you don't approve of the buisness model, TCGs are not for you.

Artifact is a strange creature. Valve managed to make a card game that succesfully avoids the norms set by other card games such as MTG and Hearthstone, for better or worse. I'm going to keep it simple and list the things the game does well along with the things that drive me nuts about the game.

Pros:
The game is very, very well balanced. There are currently no oppressive strategies or archetypes, regardless of what Axe's price tells you
Each hero having it's own Signature Card makes each deck feel unique, without shoehorning the player into a specific playstyle
It is rare to have a game snowball into hopelessness, meaning decisions that would normally be trivial in other card games have tangible effects
Having a free draft allows the player to experience most, if not all cards before they buy into a deck or strategy
Creeps being less relevant allows more niche or unusual spells to flourish, even in limited

Cons:
Even though there is a much smaller amount of RNG when compared to Hearthstone, the RNG in Artifact is still present and very frustrating at times. Heroes and Creeps being deployed into random spots on the lane can result in an unwinnable situation, regardless of decisions made by the player. 
Although it's accurate to my teammates in Dota 2, combat targets being semi-randomly chosen when there is no target directly in front of the unit feels unneccessary
Artifact doesn't explain some things to you. Bounty, units only being able to attack other units that are either in front, to the left or to the right of them, and how consumables appear in the shop are just a few examples.
Each color has some heroes that are noticably better than others in the same color
Due to the player naturally getting Heroes and Creeps on the board without any investment, creeps tend to be much less useful than other card games unless they have an important ability tied to them

With all this being said, I would still absolutely reccomend the game to any long-time TCG or CCG player. If you're coming from a CCG background (Hearthstone, Shadowverse, Eternal) be sure to realize there is a reason this game is price-gated. If people got even 1 or 2 pack for free, the economy of card prices would be eternally messed up. Artifact gives the same feeling of outplaying your opponent that MTG gives while having the vibrancy and personality that Hearthstone brings to the table. While there still are several steps that Valve could take as to make Artifact more accessible and enjoyable, the game is currently in a great space. 4/5

PS: This game didn't take the place of Half-Life 3
I've played card games professionally for a decade. Artifact is one of the best I've ever played. The game is incredibly complex and deeply fulfilling, and will challenge you even when you have played it for hundreds of hours. The marketplace for the game makes it easy to sell any of your cards or buy the deck you want in Constructed, and the prices are incredibly reasonable (as of this post no single card is over $20,  and only 2 are above $10). Previous reviews talking about how Valve is greedy with the economic model of the game are frankly laughable, and were done by people who simply wanted to rage about a model not aimed at f2p players. 

If you enjoy card games, or DOTA, or simply are looking for a fun new experience, buy Artifact. You won't regret it.
This game is a total blast.
I only played for 5 hours, but it's already worth it's price, totally would've payed 20$ once again to experience this.
In my life I only played Hearthstone (speaking of CG), and wasn't sure this format would satisfy me. Well, it did. 
Thanks, Valve, you did a great job here (and also thanks for the dota+ token, saved me my precious dollars).
Okay. So this game doesn't deserve the bad reviews people are leaving. Here's why.

1. Pay2play?? Artifact tries to follow a similar economy that of real card games. If you are coming from any card games that has any real value, then Artifact is perfectly fine in this regard. When you want to get started MTG, you buy a starter deck which can cost from $12~20. Here, you get 20 packs (5 from the start, 15 from playing. It used to be just 10) and 2 starter decks. Each pack costs about $2 so it goes well above $20 in value. If Artifact was free, then the cards would have to be untradeable/unmarketable so you would either have to grind endlessly for packs or spend lots of money and hope that you get lucky in getting rare cards that has no value whatsoever. Artifact is upfront about its value and yet people are so blinded by free2play, it is a sad sight.

2. Pay2pay2play?? You have the option to play both constructed and draft for FREE!!!! The expert mode is where you pay with tickets for the chance to win packs. If you are coming from MTG where you could play competitively in some comicbook store for the chance to win some packs, 99 cent is dirt cheap. And you can recycle 20 of your worthless commons and uncommons to make another event ticket, which can easily cost less than 99 cents to do. Remember, you get 12 cards per pack so you are already half way there to recycling another event ticket when you win a pack. Playing for free packs is also the test of skills. It is absurd that some people are expecting to earn more than they enter on average, or that Valve should take close to 0% cut.

3. Pay2win is inevitable for any card game but unlike a lot of online card games (especially the ones that are free), you can buy and sell the cards directly. You can build your competitive deck, really quickly and they are much cheaper than your standard competitive MTG decks. The price of top tier cards are lower due to the fact that 1: Each pack is $2 and contains 12, one of them being guaranteed rare. Yes, you have the chance of opening multiple rares in a single pack. 2: You only need one hero card or 3 non-hero cards to complete the collection.

Overall, most of the complaint here is straight up bad or outdated. If you are coming from Hearthstone or other similar CCG, hoping to grind hours for rewards, then this is probably not for you. But if you are a card game enthusiast from MTG or other similar TCG, this game might be for you. The gameplay and strategy is very in depth. There may be a lot of RNGs which can be annoying, but there is also a wide branch of decision making that I rarely felt like I lost due to unfavorable RNG. This game is very well designed and polished, it is sad that people don't give it a chance.
Wanted to address everyones concern about price. I purchased the game for $20 and some additional packs and sold all the excess duplicates on the steam market. You can only use one of each hero and a max of three of any other card. I ended up with around $4.50 and was able to purchase 27 of the 48 heros currently in the game for that price. Majority of the cards in the store were less then 40 cents, and to make a deck you really need about 40+ cards. The few cards that were more expensive around $1-2 were situational. If you want to play constructed there are free tournaments with the option to use personal decks or only premade decks so everyone is on equal footing. There is phantom draft where you make a deck with cards you dont own and compete in free tournaments.  If you want to buy packs its like any tcg where you get certain types of cards guarenteed in each pack. Rarity from my experience doesnt equal power. Obviously if you want to play competatively then there is an entry fee since rewards include packs of cards. It’s hard to tell right now the cost to play but if you spend a couple of bucks a month on subscription services or moble in app purchases, I don’t think it would cost more then that. Plus Artifact shares your steam currency so if you make money from other steam games, that can cover any tournament entry fees. Given that the prices of cards are already pretty low the more people that add their cards to the market should drive the price of most cards to 20 cents or lower. If your concious on price, you can make and playtest decks against bots to see how well the deck holds up. The bots own all the cards in the game and can play with any of them. Unfortunately if you make a deck with cards you don't own, you can't personally play it, just the bot. So a little backwards on testing draft decks.
TLDR: MTGO + Dota 2, Well designed, Premium, online cardgame. No nonsense, if you want a deck buy it, no RNG or grind. If you want progression or a reason to play every day, look elsewhere. 

You have to treat the game as an alternative to physical card games, its a TCG not a CCG. If you think dailies and earning free cards is needed, do you also think Hearthstone needs trading? 

If you're familiar with both TCGs (MTG, Pokemon, Yugioh) and CCGs (Hearthstone, Arena, Shadowverse) this is a decent hybrid of the two. Similar to MTGO in a lot of ways, including event tickets. The mechanics take advantage of digital card games ability to keep track of stats and abilities for you without needing a million tokens, and allowing things to happen like modifying a card for the rest of the game, even if it dies.

Pros:
 [list]
[*]No grind, you won't miss out because you didn't do your dailies. 
[*]Compared to physical games, you get about twice as many cards for your money. 
[*]Casual draft is totally free
[*]Buy the cards you want, no RNG or wasting resources through inefficient crafting.
[*Reselling cards, and extra duplicates, is extremely easy. 
[*]Doesn't take up storage space (Looks over at multiple shelves of cardboard)
[*]Online matchmaking, don't have to physically go somewhere to play with friends. 
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]Cards are not free (Uncommon for digital games, but every physical game costs money) 
[*]Secondary market is locked to steam (So you can get money back for more games, but not cash) 
[*]Digital collections aren't as tangible or fun to look at/show off as physical. (Hey look at my binder of rare stuff VS Hey look it says Axe x10)
[*]Limited mobility, a computer is harder to travel with than a deck.
[*]No "bling", nothing really special to collect or customize
[*]No form of progression to work towards, just buy cards and play. 
[/list]

I plan on playing some more, and I'll update my review when I do. But so far I've gone through the tutorial, built a deck, played it against a bot, And done a round of casual draft +1 game. 

The tutorial does a fairly good job of teaching you the game. There are a few things I don't recall seeing which become more important when building a deck, but they were easy enough to figure out. (Hero slots, exclusive cards, etc.) The UI is intuitive enough, and everything looks very polished. I wasn't a big Dota 2 player so I can't comment on the flavor, how well the cards capture items/characters, but they're pretty, and even come with voiced flavor text. 

There is a combination of passive resource generation (Lane mana) and active (gold) that I find very interesting, it emphasizes the importance of good trading. With limited abiltity to move cards you need to think carefully where you assign heroes and resources. You're essentially playing three different games with their own mana pools, but from one hand. You can win by defeating 2/3 lanes, or once a tower is destroyed, you can defeat their ancient.

Playing Vs AI was very smooth, but the player match was a little slow. Hopefully it will improve as people learn the game and take less time reading cards and deciding plays. 

It felt very balanced, no game was even close to a sweep. And it felt like the winner was decided by multiple smart and efficient plays, and not just flashy combos. There are interesting interactions, and devastating bomb cards, but the way the lanes work really help to minimilize the impact of any single action, and really make the game about your overall performance. 

I'll need more hands on time to evaluate the games balance in terms of color vs color, and the overall meta. Some cards appear very powerful at first glance, but it will take more testing to determine if they are problematic. 

I did encounter some bugs with elements sticking on screen. Sometimes when mousing over a keyword it would stick there. Mousing over it again will fix the problem. Once had it happen with a card in the deck builder of the draft, stopped me from being able to read any of my red heroes.

Some interesting value comparisons:

Artifact: Base game ([b]$19.99[/b]) comes with 2 54-card decks and 10 12 card packs. [b]228 cards.[/b]

Yugioh: 2 starter decks ([b]$9.99 x2[/b]) comes with 72 card deck and 75 card deck, no packs. [b]147 cards.[/b]

MTG: Spellslinger starter kit ([b]$19.99[/b]) comes with 2 60 card decks, no packs. [b]120 cards[/b].

Pokemon: Battle box ([b]$19.99[/b]) comes with 23 card evolution pack, and 4 10 card packs. Enough to make 1 40 card deck. with a total of [b]63 cards[/b]. Or Starter Deck x2 ([b]$12.99 x2[/b]) with 2 60 card decks, or [b]120 cards.[/b]
From a fan of both Magic, Hearthstone, and Dota, this was right up my alley when it was announced. This game has been recieving some backlash as some players see it as pay to win as the card packs need purchasing. While this is true, there are multiple game modes or drafts, where anyone can use the pre built decks during the event to counteract this fault. I'm having a blast, and can't wait to get more into the meta.
If you don't like an open card market, this game is not for you. Other F2P card games only present the illusion of free. I value my time, and grinding for 50+ hours to make a single meta deck is not appealing to me. If you like an excellently designed, strategic card game, this is definitely the game for you. The game mechanics are strong and reward smart decision making. The first set is a little bland, but that's true of any new card game. The design space is wide open, and expansions should only make this game better.
7 hours in, played some constructed with friends and some gauntlet with preconstructed launch decks. I played a lot of Magic The Gathering as a kid (before tenth edition), casually and competitively.

The game feels much harder in practice than it seemed in streams/gameplay videos: and it did seem pretty complex in there too. It's not an "easy to learn, hard to master", more of a "hard to learn, harder to master". The rules themselves are pretty straightforward (though there's quite a lot of mechanics to learn), but the tactics/strategy is pretty deep, and planning ahead is quite a challenge, even if you know what cards the opponent might have.

Pretty much every game feels tense and close, I don't think I've had a single steamroll: regardless of whether I was playing against someone obviously worse than me, or someone obviously better – there were always tense moments where I wasn't sure which way the game will go, or am I really as safe (or as screwed) as I seem to be. Each match is fun and satisfying: and a bit tiresome too!

About the money model: it seems like the game is going to be pretty expensive if you want to stay competitive in the constructed (build a deck from a cards you own) format. With that being said, the constructed matchmaking and the draft is free for everyone. The launch event with premade, strong and expensive decks is free for everyone. Tournaments and games with friends are free, and that includes draft tournaments. I have zero interest in dropping any more money on this game before I'm sure I like it and I won't more, and I'm content with the amount of value and gameplay opportunities I get from this.

There are in-game rewards, but only for the paid game modes: you can grind event tickets and card packs from winning games, but at a cost of investing an event ticket worth $1. It's then exactly the same as the regular matchmaking, but you have a chance of winning something. You get 5 tickets from buying the game, after that you can just play the exact same thing but in the free matchmaking, so with no rewards. All in all, I'm quite content with the money model of the game myself – I don't intend to buy cards/packs for it and I don't feel like I'm missing out on the content because of it.

In summary, I can totally recommend it if you like card games or just strategy games in general. It's not a game you instantly fall in love with – I had a lot more fun in my first few hours of playing hearthstone than I had so far with artifact; I didn't really like hearthstone, but it was easy to get into and enjoy casually. This is a game where you'll probably struggle to not be awful at it. You may get your ass whooped by a bot. You may suddenly lose when the board makes it seem like you have it all. It takes time to learn the ropes, and will probably take much more to be able to say that you know your way around in every situation. However, it's not *that* overwhelming, and I feel like it'll be worth. I hesitate to get into Dota because I'm facing literally hundreds of hours to even try every hero in the game, not to mention getting good at any of them. 

I feel like Artifact will be one of these games that will keep on being challenging for a long time after paying the initial confusion/frustration cost. Give it a shot, it's pretty sweet. And if you hate it, you can just sell all the ~180 cards you got with your purchase on the market and make some of the money back.
Artifact has no problems when it comes to its gameplay. The game was tested for more than half a year by pro hearthstone, MTG players and other collectible-card-game influenceres and it shows - while for a newcomer it is rather complicated and takes some time to get to know all the mechanics and concepts of the game that affect randomizer and balance, when you get ahold to all of that, Artifact hits healthy balance between simpliness of an Hearthstone and complexity of MTG.
Every game takes 3 lanes of one standart Hearthstone game, and it also impacts the length of the game and the influence of randomness to the outcome. Contrary the popular opinion, Artifact isnt less random than Hearthstone, the difference is in the control of that random -  lets say you've got RNG'd creeps to the lane that you don't want to push anymore, you can adjust to that during deployment phase, you can deploy a hero to that lane just to play cards that move units to other lanes, or you can change your strategy and decide to focuse to that lane back, if you have cards that strengthen creeps. In other words because each random element impacts the game less and you have more decisions to make during the game, overall impact of random elements is less, even though randomness of the game is not less than in Hearthstone.
And another way to negate the RNG is the deck composition. Have the plan for the game, have the set of cards to help to bring the plan to fruition - you may not feel the game cheat you as much as you expect it from the other games of this genre.
Ant cards, decks and overall price of the game is its greatest enemy. The years of freemium collectible-card-games thaught us that the core experience should be free, and if you want, you can pay on top of that to get better cards, and subsequently better chances to get better results. "The most powerful card in the deck is a credit card" - the meme that is as strong as ever, and unfortunately it is true to this game, the metagame dictates the prices for the gards on steam market and you can't really play free deck competitively. The wierd way VALVE decided to cut this corner is to make this game alike MTG in the sence that is Pay-to-play - if everyone has 10 packs for 20$ purchase, then everyone has either non-free set of cards to play, or everyone has some set of cards to sell on a market and then buy a set of cards to play. On top of that you can't earn new cards/packs/tickets, unless you spent an entry ticket (that costs 4.95$ each, or 20 recycled cards that will get you an entry ticket significantly cheaper, since cheapest cards on the market are roughly 0.05$, 5 are included with your initial purchase), to get into non-free competitive game modes, and still, non-free modes do not even guarantee you that you get even your money back. Luckaly, if you don't seek to play non-free competitive experience, you get free analogue (without rewards at stake) of those gamemodes.

And that's where controversy and negativity of people have to pay for what they [b]expect[/b] to get for free meets the game that has good card design, aesthetically pleasing graphics, good soundtrack and crutially, fun gameplay. 
What I [b]think[/b] will happen is that in 5-6 months steam stats for players active in the game will plummit to a couple of thousands concurrent users and VALVE will have to make some sort of free-to-play client to play the game with free decks and in free game modes.

I liked it, I would recommend this game, but if you are not sold on the idea of pay-to-play, or you aren't convinced that you will have a great time in this, I'd adviced to wait until it's free.
Lots and lots of fun. Very clean gameplay, visuals, and score. It gets a bad rap for its monetization model which is a bit misdirected. Compared to other popular digital card games Artifact is unique in the way that you can purchase the cards you like outright as opposed to grinding away pack after pack. You will also see people saying that this is a Hearthstone clone... which honestly doesn't make much sense if you've actually played Artifact. The two games are insanely different, the only aspect they share is the fact they are digital card games.

 I highly reccomend this game to anyone looking for something very strategic and competitive (even relaxing) to sink some hours into.
I've been playing CCGs formore than 20 years, some of them on a very competitive basis, so I'm usually highly critical of card games. With digital card games, there are many possibilities than cannot be explored on physical card games, but most games have done this mostly by adding more RNG factors to the game, usually way too many. Artifact does this in a good way (except for maybe arrows.. they could use some tweaks). The game is still in it's early stages so diversity is not much, but it's easy to see that the mechanics can create lot's of depth and complex decision making, which I personally believe that are the best features a digital CCG can have.
Once you become decent playing, it's also easy to go "unlimited" with tickets, and you end up even getting some steam account balance (don't except to get rich or anything) just by playing. Also, when you want a specific deck for constructed, you can use that same balance to buy the specific cards you want instead of opening endless boosters of crappy cards which ends up being way more expensive.

At the end of the day, Artifact is the best Digital CCG I've played and I really believe in it's future.
If you ever played a physical card game like Magic, Yugioh, or Pokemon. You'll understand that buying this game is like buying 2 starter decks and 5 booster packs. You can even sell your cards from the packs. Its not that different from playing a physical card game. It is not free to play because you can easily make the money back and sell your cards like a physical card game. 

Artifact is a very in-depth and extremely decision intensive card game. It's far more strategic than other card games because of that. It's complexity might scare off new people but give it a little bit of time and you might fall in love with it. 

Games are rarely stomps (a very common thing in cardgames), every match feels butt-clenching and is tense. Games do take long however, they can really take up to 30-40 minutes sometimes which is a lot. This is not really a casual cardgame, but it's not meant to be, if you want to do a full phantom draft, expect to be playing for a few hours.

The monetization is fine, I've been playing gauntlet draft (where you use one ticket and if you get 3 wins you get it back, win more and you get packs). So far I've totally been able to go endless since if you get a 5 win you get 2 packs + your ticket back. 2 packs equals one ticket for sure, especially if you get a good rare. If you get common sh*tty cards you'll have 1.2 ticket through recycling, if you get a rare that you can sell for a dollar or more, you got your ticket already. So endless shouldn't be a problem at all, I'm slowly building my collection and it's a blast. And let's be honest, if you drop 10 or 20 bucks on the game for tickets (which is a very fair price to drop on any game) you'll be playing for a long time.

If you want to play constructed from the start it will cost a little bit to pay for it, but to get one competitive deck it will be significantly cheaper than hearthstone, thanks to the market and buying specific cards. 

The skill ceiling is incredibly high so it's easy to spot players who are much better at the game, in draft you get rewarded even more. I personally never liked the net decking and copy pasting of decks. Draft here rewards good deckbuilding, a skill that for the most part is completely ignored in constructed (since you copy the best decks). Draft not only rewards your skill and knowledge about building a good deck, but it also rewards a good player in the normal game during the actual matches. For me this is the ultimate skill test and with a very decision intensive game it works incredibly well. There is some rng however that I sometimes dislike, but the vast decisions you have to make kinda outweigh that (screw cheating death though, that card is stupid).
Disclaimer : [b] I am an infinite draft player. Therefore this review will only cover draft aspect of the game. You should look elsewhere if you're not a draft player. [/b]

[h1] Gameplay	[/h1]
The thing that sets this game apart from its competition is its 3 lane setup. A lot of strategic depth in this game comes from the tradeoff between a lane's tempo and carrying initiative (it's like priority in magic) to another lane. The 3 lanes also makes 3 colour drafts more viable. You can splash a colour by drafting cards from said colour which has effects outside of the current lane. This allows you to leave that splash hero stuck in a dead lane while still getting benefits from that hero's colour. Overall, this increases the skill cap thus minimizing the impact of RNG. In my experience, only around 5-10 percent of games were lost to RNG. The rest of my losses can usually be attributed to misplays or getting outplayed by my opponents.

[h1] Meta stuffs	[/h1]
At the time of writing I have clocked 25 hours in game, I owned 7 event tickets, 3 card packs & a couple decent pauper decks, and I have completely recouped what I've spent on this game. Of course my experience is not exactly the same as the average player's, I have around 75% winrate in draft and I have been quite lucky with my pulls in Keeper Draft. But if you are good at drafting, you can definitely make a profit by mugging noobs in expert phantom draft. As for the duration of a draft session, I find it to be around 2-3 hours. Bear in mind that I'm a pretty fast player who rarely hears the timeout warning. A session can definitely get to 4 hours if you're the type that ropes a lot.

[b] Overall, Artifact is one of the best games if you're looking for a draft card game. There's some problematic cards, but they're all rares so that's for constructed players to deal with. And the RNGs can definitely be played around most of the time. So it's a definite recommend from me.	[/b]
Amazing game all the negative reviews are just ignorant reviews as usual. They're mostly complaining because they're too stupid to understand that a market place exists. 20$ is already a low price and you get 2 starter decks and 10 packs containing 120 cards. Three of the cards I opened from that pack already covered the 20$ I payed (I opened two horn of the alphas worth 7$ each and time of triumph worth 8$ and no its not luck you get a guaranteed rare for each pack which is the highest rarity and at one point i opened 3 rares in one pack its crazy) You can own 90% of the cards in the game for less than 30$ if you buy it in the market place and its only gonna get cheaper most cards are less than 10 cents and theres only two cards above 10$. And the best part is you can choose what cards you wanna buy no RNG bullshit wasting money on packs and you can honestly build a decent deck for 5-10$ if youre on a budget since you dont need all the cards to play.
I don't know what gives me more joy; using my cost-efficient decks to beat people with $200 decks or giggling at the people who whine and complain that you can’t be good at this game without spending a lot of money.

Artifact with its market economy is what online TCGs have needed for a long time.  Richard Garfield and Valve have knocked it out of the park with this one.  I haven’t had this much fun with a card game since the Star Wars TCG, and it’s no surprise that three lane system works just as well in Artifact as it did in that game.
Great game, Magic The Gathering Online done right! It's no differnet then paper magic really, you buy packs of cards to add to your collection, you can "trade" them by buying or selling them to make the decks you want. The UI/Presentation is much better then Magic Arena or Hearthstone and you can draft for free to your hearts content in casual draft mode, you just dont get to keep the cards.  Great for learning the cards you want to aquire for your decks. If you were brought up on paper magic, and dont have a problem buying new cards (that you will own and can sell EASILY on the steam market if you want out), then you will love this game.
Haven't had this much fun playing a TCG in a long while.
Not even that pay2win as people think as most games you can win with those out of meta cards if you are aware of how to use them.
Pretty good. Very fun, lots of options for deck builds. Pretty addictive, games can go fast or slow depending on your deck.
Has a lot of development left to do, however. Needs more features and content. Lack of spectating, match making has no visible MMR, after about 15 hours you realize there aren't enough cards to really flex the game system. Animations are okay, numerous graphical glitches with UI, broken chat and pause functions.
People crying about the money and cost are semi justified. The game is a CCG, of course some cards are going to be worth a lot more than others. However, making ranked play locked behind payed tickets seems off. People pay for the cards already, why make them pay to play with the cards they payed for?
Playing against your buds is great though. Lots of counter play and strategy for a CCG, with a healthy amount of RNG.
I'm very excited to see what Valve does with this game in the future. New cards, quality-of-life improvements, new mechanics will breath a constant stream of life into this game.
Will probably be free to play before the end of 2019.
I can’t help but think that people complaining about the monetization model are complete ignorant concerning TCG games. Especially digital ones.

Every single other game forces you to grind for packs to build decks. They have a complete RNG loot box system that you have to throw your money at to be able to be competitive.

Artifact is not like this at all. You get to choose which card you want and buy it.

Axe is 14 bucks right now at launch. Most of the other cards are below 50 cents.

How in the world of TCG could you possibly be upset about how the game is monetized?

Unless you expect all of the cards to be given to you with your 20 dollar purchase? In this case rip for the longevity of the game and future expansions.

I honestly think this is a case of the Reddit/internet hive mind. Same thing happens with every game. As soon as the bozo with the loudest voice complains about something everyone jumps on board to rally with this idiot. I’m not saying these things are never justified because there are plenty of reasons to “rally” but there are just as many misplaced ones as there are justified ones.

The monetization is something that the TCG community has been waiting for for a long time.

On top of all this the most balanced way to play (drafting) is fucking free. Casual phantom draft allows you to use all of the cards in the set for free.

This coupled with tournaments with friends is revolutionary in the realm of online TCG games so before you start rallying along with the crowd that’s against the monetization please get informed because the way valve has chosen to launch this game is a giant step in the right direction for the TCG genre as a whole.

Edit: when you guys have played the game enough to feel good about a review please do so. Negative or positive. Based on a lot of these comments people who are complaining aren’t familiar with the TCG market and don’t see this as a huge step in the right direction as it should be seen.

That being said I do agree that the ticket system for expert play feels bad for a lot of players as you aren’t sure if you’re going to be able to win back your tickets and will thus have to buy more but these modes rotate out on 12/14/2018 and so I am left to believe that the “progression” that they are planning to add will be some sort of ranked ladder that will not rotate and will not cost tickets.

This is my assumption but I would be willing to bet that I am correct about this. If the ranked MMR system doesn’t happen then by all means point and laugh and say I told you so.

Perhaps the progression system will award tickets and packs and give incentive to play more casual modes to participate in these tournament like events.

I do hope that a ranked ladder happens and that it doesn’t cost tickets. I can’t see them adding MMR system to the current expert pool. I think that would be a huge mistake on valves part but I guess we will see.
First thing I gotta say is - base gameplay is amazing.
But immediately after that - there's more RNG than there needs to be in a card game (talking about output RNG now, with cards like Cheating Death in particular).

And when one combines greedy monetization scheme with current lack of social features (and features in general), and especially with the "no balancing will be done"... it's hard to recommend the game to anyone :(

I hope it changes in the future

EDIT: Dec 21st
Patches so far have fixed most of my complaints (it is now possible to get packs without spending any money, even if at a slow rate), so I am changing my review to Recommended.
Edit: I'm leaving my old review up, but it seems that they did address pretty much all of my points, almost the day after I posted. The thing that makes me hopeful for the future is that they are willing to balance their cards in a bad/unfun/unbalanced meta going forward. Blizzard does it as well, and it works. Changing my review to a positive. There is a creative and deep game to be had here and the cards are pretty inexpensive.

---- original review ---

I've played artifact a fair amount and I think I can have enough to make a preliminary assessment on this game. It's a good game, plagued with fairly deep problems. The biggest problem in my opinion is the game balancing. There are cards that are strictly better than other cards. There are a handful of cards (the expensive ones) that will decide games entirely on their own. Games often come down to who has those cards in their decks, and who can get them out the fastest. The only way that I can think to fix this is by an overhaul in balancing of the hero cards. *All* of the hero cards need to be balanced to offer creative strategies. Right now the power is concentrated in only a handful of cards.

This isn't a P2W complaint. Even if you own every card in the game, only a minority of the cards are playable, and since decks don't actually run that many cards, you wind up playing against the same set of decks over and over again, and seeing the same cards again and again. Did you enjoy losing to Gust+combo, where you sit there powerless, unable to even take your turn? Plenty more where that came from.

That is not to say that there is not a good strategy TCG underneath the mess, because there is. There is a lot of creativity here and there is a lot to like, but I don't see valve coming down next month with sweeping changes to fix this. The other problems are the lack of progression, lack of rewards, no daily quests, nothing to grind for. Most games might be a fun time waster but you never feel like you're working towards something or accomplishing anything. Some people like the fact that there's no direct incentive to log in each day, but imo, it gives you something to look forward to. This game does not offer the player something to look forward to and I think that sums up my experience with this game.
As far as mechanics, gameplay and polish goes it towers above the competition. However the economic model has some blemishes to it.

If you're primarily interested in playing draft modes, then for 20 bucks you can draft to your heart's content for free and without limitations.

Constructed however has a payment model which is a carbon copy of physical Magic: The Gathering. With all the advantages & disadvantages that brings.
Costs less than Hearthstone if you want to be ultra competitive but seems unsuited for casual play, unless you only draft, in which case it's unparalleled.
I have been playing other card games in the past, including Hearthstone, Elder Scrolls Legends and Magic the Gathering (both Paper and MTGA). Especially the latter has been great fun for me, and I thought I will not need to switch to a different card game anymore.

Then came Artifact and with it the promise of having a game that lets me draft regularly without spending a ton of money! I don't dislike constructed game modes, but my true love was always for the "limited" formats in card games. The problem is that if you want to play limited in for example MTGA, you likely will have to invest real money or grind through some constructed every while again first to get to play it regularly. 

In Artifact you can draft completely for free though, and this is the reason why I bought Artifact. There is a free Draft mode, there are free community tournaments and there are also Prize Draft modes which cost an entry ticket, but also have potential rewards if you do well. And for me, unlike in other card games, it has been very easy so far to actually go positive in Artifact drafts, so this is a great added bonus for myself, though the payout system is made so that this will not be the case for every player. Still, you can still enjoy the game for free if you are less fortunate and leave prize drafts out of the equation (or try it again once you feel you improved your skill).

If you love drafting, I think you will enjoy this game as well. If you are interested in the game for Constructed modes, I cannot give you any opinion because I simply have not even touched them.
It's a good game, definitely doesn't deserve all the negative reviews purely on the aspect that "it's pay to play". Hearthstone, if you want to get anything done, requires nearly $100 dollars to get a significant amount of cards to be meta, where in this game you can just buy cards off the market for 20 dollars. 

The gameplay itself actively tests your mind, definitely more reliant on your skill rather than RNG. It feels really good to outskill an opponent.
This is a really really good game. Every complaint I have about Hearthstone, Shadowverse, MTGA is resolved in Artifact. It's plays very well, strategy is challenging, games are reactive and interactive, you always anticipating, adapting, trying to sneak one past your opponent, sometimes muscling them. You never know how the game is going to go until you play it. I love this game! Animations are gorgeous as a bonus (hearthstone is very low res and dull after playing Artifact - yes I even check my graphics settings were maxed out).

Let me address the criticism: 
- Game is pay to win
There is only ONE out of SIX game modes where this matters. But say you exclusively want to play expert constructed or just for pride you want a full collection, it's currently about $US180. Based on some quick research hearthstone is about $US1280 for a full set and MTGA is $750 for enough cards to play completively - not even close to the complete set. I don't have a full set and playing constructed is not my preferred playstyle in any case.
- There are no rewards and incentives
Are we so whipped by the games companies that we now only play for digital rewards? We play sub par games, grind for 100's of hours for a handful of dollars worth of digital cards? I know I have been guilty of this. Artifact has shown me the light. Buy Artifact for US$19, never buy any cards, play the free games modes (including common card tournaments, phantom draft, constructed and leaderboard win streak event playing with 8 premade decks) and you get a much better quality game, more satisfying and the only way you aren't happy is if you NEED someone to give you a token reward that is ultimately worth next to nothing.
-Lack of social features
All this has been resovled in 1.1 and they're far better than MTGA and Hearthstone.

I decided to write this because I genuinely have not enjoyed a game this much in years. You can buy into the complaints that this game deviates from the TCG standard model or you can ignore the anti-hype and enjoy a really top notch game. I choose the latter, hope you do too. 

See you on the battlefield!
I don't understand the whiners: 10 packs of cards for 20$ [u](containing 12 cards each)[/u] are included with the first purchase along with 2 base decks. 
You are not paying the game, but the price of the bundled 10 packs of cards wich you would eventually buy anyway; the 2 starter additional decks are provided for free.
Great trading cards game, AND I MEAN GREAT ! But it seems that people (including dumb webzine reviewers) nowdays love to complain when something is not free, just for the sake of it. 
Do you like working for free ?
This is NOT Hearthstone, where a pack costs double for less than half the cards; BUT SURE, there you can grind a week for two "free" packs of cards [u]containing 5 cards each[/u] ! 
You are welcome !
(first card game ever where you cant collect cards for your deck until you pay real money for them.
also the "best" and rare cards are the same, so you have to pay good money to have a decent deck.

some months ago i wouldnt have thought that valve could fuck up as bad as EA, bethesda and also blizz, shame on all of them.. and welcome to the future, where every developer and publisher thinks about money and not a tiny bit about the playerbase nor the healthiness of their brand/game.)

they fixed it. gj <3
I was wrong.

At first, i share my doubt of this game being a complete pay to win.
but after a few of my friends convince me to buy the game (in the end they say that they will pay half of the game price and they did a pretty good job convincing me) i did and play it with them at first to learn the basics.

After a few hours i spent on this game now i could say that the game is actually very good.

It's not a complete pay to win kinda game. Even with cheap deck you could still win against a pretty exxpensive one by luck and skill (from constructing the deck to the actual gameplay)

Yes i think there should be a way for the player to get free card by maybe winning a couple casual match or something, and maybe make the ticket for expert play a bit cheaper but the game it self is good enough for me to cover those flaw.

Note: i am not a competitive player. If some people say "whats the point playing casual here if you don't get any reward or stuff" i'd say the game is fairly new. There might be some changes, there might be not. And for me personally playing the actual game it self is fun and worth while. It's not pointless, it's fun to play, well made and thats how a game is at it's core. again yes you dont get any 'reward' or achievment or something but the game is good that it make up for it.

For the actual game it self, in my experience it last averagely 15-25 min / match, could be more if it's a hard fought, could end within 10 min if easy.

So i'd say give it a try. Ignore the hate. Beside, once you buy the game, you get 10 packs right? There's a pretty good chance you get expensive cards from there. if you don't like the game, just sell those cards and you got your money back. easy.
[h1]Artifact is like a singleplayer Dota (except there are no raging [strike]russians[/strike] teammates.)[/h1]

Most fun I had in a while. This game looks like Dota, it sounds like Dota and it definitely feels like Dota. 
You will find everything in this game from the creep and item managment to the hero deployment.
You constantly have to question yourself and your decisions. Is it wise to push down the lane? Or should you TP back and try to defend your ancient? If you love Dota because of the complexity and you like card games you won`t be dissapointed.

[spoiler](and Dota finally gets the lore it deserved all the time) <3[/spoiler]
E: Issues addressed. Good stuff.

The economic model is fine. I'd rather be told how much everything costs straight up rather than grinding for content with in-game currencies and daily quests. Sure, games with such models (Hearthstone, League) can be played for free, even at the highest level, but the system is constructed to make that grind gruelling and tortorous so you spend money to skip ahead anyway. Granted there is a huge audience that can control themselves and not spend that money, but if Valve wants a market-driven card economy, they cannot introduce such a system to Artifact without tanking the value of ... well, everything. It's different, it's a little bit annoying, but it's honestly a breath of fresh air, too.

However, you can't take away those addicting features of a game and replace them with nothing. I get that the developers are trying to create a more traditional card game environment, but being digital gives you so many ways to keep me playing that don't have to be those toxic models that you're avoiding. Give me some form of visible MMR, a ladder system, unlockable skins for my cards or board, anything ... Don't just award my perfect phantom draft run that I spent hours on with a +1 to my run counter. It doesn't have to be these features if they're something to be avoided, but the developers need to give us [i]something[/i]. What am I playing for, exactly? What do I have to show for being better at the game? The only rewards require payment for entry, but the matchmaking is skill-based (ie you have a 50% winrate over time) so you'll quickly reach a point where you're not gaining anything.

I really want the game to be successful because it goes against the established dogma I explained in my first paragraph (and because it's fun as hell), but I literally have no incentive to spend my time playing if at the end of the day I have nothing to show for it.
Artifact is a solid CCG. Even if you enver buy another card beyond the starter packs, I'd argue the free casual Phantom Draft is worth 20$ and you'll get more than your money's worth in fun. There's only a few areas where coinflip RNG are a problem, and certainly not enough to ruin the overall fun of the game. Managing multiple lanes, heroes dying and returning a round later, and the win conditions create complex scenarios where decisions matter and strategy is rewarded. If you dig card games, give this one a whirl.
Pros: 

+ The game is unlike any other card game out there. Very in-depth gameplay.
+ Great visuals.
+ Best CCG / TCG monetization on the market. £16 to get in and then you can play draft forever for free, and can individually buy cards on the market for pennies.
+ The best private tournament system I have ever seen in a game. Great for playing with friends.
+ No ladder! No grind! Just play for fun.

- Some super powerful cards are hovering at the £10-£15 range, but only 2 of them currently.

= Game length is super long for a card game, sitting at around 30 mins to an hour. I like this but some people may not.
[h1] Intro [/h1]
Artifact is easily one of the most complex card games ever created, and its also probably the highest quality. But ill be talking about how most people complain about the monetization model, with claims that its overpriced or "pay to pay". These people don't understand how powerful the ability to buy single cards are, why the game costs 20$, or what casual phantom draft is. 
[h1] Secondary Market [/h1]
The ability to buy single cards or trade makes this game unique, as no other games that I know of have this ability, this lets you buy competitive decks from anywhere around 30-70 dollars (estimate). I can guarantee you, as an experienced hearthstone player, that if you were to spend 70-100 dollars on hearthstone card packs, you would not get EVEN CLOSE to completing a top tier competitve deck, decks such as cube hunter and malygos druid have an upwards of FIVE legendaries (8000 dust) , and with how atrocious and unforgiven the dust system is in hearthstone, you would have to open an upwards of 100 packs AND scrap the epics and legendaries you dont need to get this number. 
[h1] Game Price [/h1]
The game price is 20$ for two primary reasons: its to jumpstart the artifact secondary market, and the other is to encourage deckbuilding and intrigue. Jumpstarting the economy by giving TWENTY DOLLARS worth of packs (10 packs) heavily lowers the economy price of cards because of the added supply. 
[h1] Casual Phantom Draft [/h1]
The last part is the casual phantom drafts. Using the classic physical card game drafting style (https://magic.wizards.com/en/game-info/gameplay/formats/booster-draft), you LITERALLY GET ACCESS TO EVERY CARD IN THE GAME, every card is in the draft pool to pick! (pack rng is a factor). For 20 dollars you get access to play and use every card in the game theoretical, and its not even that unrealistic for that to happen. This is actually insanely great comparing it to other drafts such as hearthstone arena (which requires in game currency to enter! Casual phantom draft is free). 
[h1] Final notes [/h1]
I havent even mentioned the actual gameplay or the amazing QoL things valve does to make this experience so satisfying and accessable. If you like card games, if you like DOTA, if this is interesting to you, you should probably get it. Most people who downvote this game for monetization has definetly not done their homework and are not making proper statements, and even if you're still unsure, check out some gameplay videos or livestreams and do some research! 

My team keeps feeding.  CM is running down mid.  Only hope is late game.

It's fun.  

Once you buy it you can play casual draft. Don't worry about constructed unless you are commited to buying cards.  They are cheap at the moment however.
Great card game. I don't plan on spending money beyond the initial purchase, there is more than enough in the casual modes to occupy me.

Some way to grind cards or packs for free and a ranking system would be great, I hope they add that in the future.
A lot of the reviews are dissing the monetization model. I wanted to perhaps clear up some misconceptions. I've p[ayed about 40 hours through the beta and mostly draft at that (market didnt exist).

Expert Draft mode is similar to arena in Gwent/Hearthstone  with 5 wins, 2 losses whichever one comes first. Instead of ore/gold it costs a ticket. At 3 wins you recieve your ticket back and at 5 wins you get 2 free packs + ticket back. Cards from these packs can be milled for tickets (20 cards for a ticket) each pack contains 12 cards. So in short you get to choose the best 4 cards and you get 2 tickets back for each fully successful run - or you can just keep the cards to grow your collection.

Normal draft is completely free with no upside to winning or losing.

Constructed is gonna cost money if you want to build your own deck or you grind draft like a madman. With one (potentially massive upside) its way cheaper than MTG and Hearthstone. How many DLCs and packs would you have to buy in order to fill your HS collection. Same can be said for MTG. 

So I think the price point is fine though it is weird on Valves part. In Gwent and in HS you had starter packs you could buy, and here, it feels like Valve is forcing you to buy it upfront. Be aware that once you spend a ticket/open packs you can no longer refund. So yeah thats all a bit weird and less than ideal but I wouldn't go as far as to call it a "shady microtransaction" practice. And again, if you dont like it after trying the completely free draft mode you can refund your upfront payment. 

Yeah its a shame that theres another TCG where you are pretty incentivised to buy packs if you want to play constructed. I would argue the same is true for other existing TCGs (maybe excluding gwent) so it shouldn't be that surprising. If you really wanted to you could argue that by putting a price on the base game, Valve are being upfront about it not being free as opposed to other games that claim to be f2p and actually aren't. 

From a gameplay perspecitve I'm completely loving it. The gameplay is very cleverly designed and I don't see myself getting bored anytime soon. It's not perfect but it is very good.

Another small note of commendation is that even in the really short closed beta there were significant changes, to benefit the player, which makes me happy because to me that's a massive indication that this isnt't a cash grab. If you can afford it I'd go for it and if you really hate it just refund it. If you enjoy it as much as I do it definetely is money well spent.

EDIT: I thought I'd dislike arena and play more constructed (like I do in other TCGs) however draft feels so good in Artifact, I think that also leads to a lot of frustration because generally people prefer constructed in TCGs.

After seeing market prices a few tips: some cards are 1 cent, so for 20 cents you can buy a ticket (as opposed to the 2$ in game price). Buy 20 cards and mill for a ticket. If you still really want to play constructed - decks are so much cheaper than I thought they would be. It's also less gambly in the sense that you just buy the cards outright. As opposed to opening packs and hoping for the best. I think packs have become completely redundant. Another thought that occurred is that if you do build a collection and decide to quit, at least you can recoup some money back to your steam wallet by selling on the market - which is so much better than in other TCGs where if you get bored the collection you spent countless hours building is literally useless.
I'm not usually a fan of card games, but so far I've really enjoyed this one. The gameplay is simple enough to be picked up easily (I was initially intimidated by watching streams), but deep enough to enable lots of different strategy crafting and combinations. I can't speak to the competitive / monetization model yet, but from what I've heard you are able to purchase specific cards / decks instead of relying on loot boxes to gain cards. 

Worth the initial investment of $20 for the starter pack, in my opinion. I even snagged an Axe card that's currently marketable for $15 right now! :D

Enjoy!
PROS: Has Winter Wyvern as a playable Hero Card. The Devs made a very integral decision to add such a lovely character into this game. The mechanics she provides allows players to not only have fun by playing with her, but also against. Using the interesting features of the Hero Card encourages trickery and prediction which heavily emphasizes the hero color she hails from- black. To top it off, the Hero is a giant f*cking ice dragon that reads/writes books which in my opinion is such a “cool” character design. The voice lines she exhibits as well also create a wonderful immersion experience that makes the game that much more enjoyable.

CONS: Doesn't currently have Phoenix as a playable Hero Card. I really don't know why the Devs decided to do this. I mean, the game is based off of DotA 2- a game with the literal best character in any series ever and they didn't even think to put Phoenix into Artifact? The detrimental effects of doing such are quite obvious. First off, Phoenix is a bird that murders, that's it; how can you just shrug off the possibility of having a murder-bird as a possible core element in a deck? -and don't you say "Oh, but there's Skywrath Mage that you can play!" HA! That inbred inferior chickenman doesn't even compare to the glorious radiant being that is THE Phoenix? Besides, the gameplay mechanics Phoenix could add are limitless. Imagine a situation where your tower is about to fall and you need saving. It looks as if all hope is lost and then “BAM!” swooping down from above is that marvelous godamned star bird that lands right in the middle of his foes only to then literally incinerate all of them! F*cking magnificent. This was clearly an overlook by the Devs and until they fix this problem I can't give this game a perfect review.
After the last update I can finally give recomend the game. The core mecanics of the game are great and there is room for even more complex and interesting cards. The thing about Artifact is that it always feels that you can play better and it's not your card draw that won or lost you a game - it is your decisionmaking. Nevertheless there are still things missing. The implemented rankingsystem needs probably refinement and more cards will make the constructed side of the game more interesting.
So most of the negative reviews are about this game being pay-to-play, like you can't get cards without sinking a ton of money and so on.

[h1]This. Is. False.[/h1]
It is nonsense, written by people who went ranting around without documenting themselves properly.

I am a free player, and I actually do get new cards quite frequently, and make some Steam money on the side. To do so, all you need is to get good at drafting, and learn how the community market works. Furthermore, there's a huge lot of stuff to do there for free, in any sense of the term. Not gonna expand on this any further.

Regarding the actual game, the fact you have to manage three distinct boards and see how you're gonna divide your resources between those is really clever. It basically enables an additional layer of strategy, compared to other card games, and it works wonders. Cool to see Richard Garfield and the guys at Valve were able to be creative enough to make something different from the usual Hearthstone ripoff.
There's a massive learning curve, though, and I think the game would need some in-depth tutorials to help people who are not very familiar with complex card games get started, especially in draft mode, which is typically not something you'll fully understand in a few minutes.
Overall, it has great mechanics, a very respectable variety of different playstyles for a base set, and very polished graphics. Gotta love the soundtrack too.
I also noticed there is a mode where you can pick a deck from a pool of about ten, and go playing some games against people who were given the same choice as you. I think it's really cool. Whether you're new to this and want to get familiar with different archetypes, or you don't want to jump in the constructed queue, just to see the same handful of over-optimized decklists over and over (just like in pretty much any card game, once you get past a certain level), that's gonna be tons of fun.

In a nutshell, it's a pretty solid game that requires a lot of thinking, and is not yet as beginner-friendly as it could be. I'd definitely recommend it to long-time MtG or Netrunner players.
After playing the game with the updates I can safely change my review to recommending it. The changes made are completely in the right direction. Even if you get all the packs from the leveling up you will most likely need to get a few extra ones from the market if you are not lucky but still it gives you many tickets to get some more cards. Definitely doesnt need the amount of money it used to. Seems like Valve is doing something good here.

=============
Update: The packs was successfully delivered after hours.
[spoiler]真香！[/spoiler]
Don't listen to the people complaining about the cost. The pricing is reasonable and there are many gamemodes you can play absolutely free. The gameplay is strategic and fun. This is the new gold standard of card games.
In just one month, Valve has responded to all of the criticism of their game in a positive manner, and have made the necessary changes. The game is now more affordable, more balanced, and has better progression than when it was launched.

From a gameplay perspective, this is the best digital TCG available. Valve proves that they're willing to make fundamental changes to their entire design philosophy in order to make it successful.

---

If you get the game now, you get 5 packs to start with, but can earn up to 15 free packs per season (we don't know how long seasons will last as of yet). Packs are earned by leveling up (which also gives cosmetics and event tickets), so there's no need to win, just to play. A new player without a collection can earn levels (as well as MMR ranks) by playing phantom draft, which is completely free and the most popular competitive mode. 

In addition, you can buy singles via the community market. As of the present review, the cost of a full collection, including 1x every hero and 3x every other card, is 130 dollars. 

Between the free packs and the community market, a savvy player who is not content with draft wants to break into constructed can probably earn a functionally complete collection, consisting of every meta deck, for less than 100 dollars. This price is more likely to drop in the future than to rise. So, for slightly more than the cost of a AAA game, you get a complete TCG with every single card.

Highly recommended.
An excellent card game that has meaningful decisions and requires actual thought to do well at. No offense to Hearthstone, sometimes vegging out to a game is exactly what you need, but you can't veg out to this one. The rng can get frustrating time to time, particularly on the flop, but the three lane design can create surprising opportunities for comebacks that simply aren't in other card games. Valve has recently improved the rather despised eco system through a pretty basic progression system (though I think the people crying pay to win were being ridiculous, every card game is pay to win, its just in other online card games you can choose to pay an enourmous of time by grinding for cards). More importantly, their change of heart to balance cards is a huge step in the right direction. If you're a fan of the genre and you find Hearthstone or Gwent a bit too repetitive and simplistic, ignore the mindless hate around this game, this is great stuff.
Everybody agrees the gameplay is great, and it truly is miles ahead of hearthstone, but people are negatively reviewing for the monitization. Let me address these complaints.
1) People complain about spending 15 dollars for a single card
A) there is literally only one card in the entire game at that price range, and its basically only because of the hype these attitudes put on it. 
2) people complain that you have to pay to play competitive modes
A) this is just downright not true, you only have to pay to play modes where you have the opportunity to win packs, not to mention the fact that you can recycle cards into tickets, and the game gives you 5 tickets just for getting it. 
3) people complain about the cost to buy cards (besides axe)
A) ~80% of cards are <10 cents, which means a full deck can cost a few dollars and nothing more, maybe 5-10 if youre getting rare heroes. In hearthstone you have to grind and buy packs for dust, just to turn 4 legendaries which come every 40 packs, into one of the several legendaries you need for a decent deck. 

TL;DR : every negative review ive seen is absolute misinformation and garbage written by someone who was determined to hate the game from the start
Reviewing to counteract the haters. This game is great, an incredibly engaging, complex system with a high skill ceiling. I'm having a lot of fun with it and look forward to its continued growth and development. If there's a negative its how complex it is. Almost all negative reviews are about the monetization - and that is what it is. It doesn't make it a bad game. If you don't like it, then you don't have to play. It's also for a reason - the lack of a grind currency allows the cards to be marketable and retain value. I got more then $20 worth of cards out of the packs that came with my $20 purchase of the game.
So I was quite hesitant about writing a review. I liked the game how it was before the progression patch - it was basically cheaper MTG with deeper gameplay, which was exactly what I wanted. But right now...
Damn, Valve did a great job with this game. 

Pros:
- The game is VERY deep. Even the best pro's still agree that they learn something new every day.
- Its skill based in the purest form. RNG is done "right" - it makes the game interesting, but it doesn't decide games by itself. Trust me, it doesn't. If you lose to a coin flip, you should have done something to not get to this situation in the first place.
- Three-lane gameplay means that combo decks are in check and with good deployment you can overcome even stronger decks.
- Controversely, by not being free2play, its very cheap! Marketplace means you can always get what you want without having to rely on RNG, and you can actually get some sweet value for your money.

Cons:
- The game is hard. You'll learn the basics in a few games, but getting deployment right, playing for initiative and other subtle mechanics will take you hundreds of games to fully understand. Be warned, you won't get any wins for free here. Great players casually mantain 80%+ winrate. (In the end, is this even a Con? Depends on what you want.)
- Games usually take a little bit longer than in MTG, Heartstone or others. Don't expect to jam that many games to your standart evening.

My thoughts about the progression patch:
The progression system might be a bit over-generous, but the game needed it to recover its playerbase. And damn, you can't really complain about free stuff, right?
From a balance standpoint, I see a very bright future for Artifact. Nerfing opressive cards and buffing those which underperform is a beautiful thing which will keep the game interesting and the format might never be really "solved". Screw market value, this will make the GAME better and thats what counts.
This game is the next big card game. Monetization is actually great despite all of the negative reviews. It makes sense, it is fair and there is a possibility to not spend a penny after the purchase. You are getting rewarded for being good, same as in any other card game, but here you have a perfectly free platform to practice. With your friends in custom tournaments or solo on Casual Phantom Draft. Enjoy the gameplay, enjoy the great lore and simply stay to see where this game goes with time as it has a lot to offer. Seriously. Valve fixed the drama, fixed the flaws. Now we can enjoy it.
Pretty fun game. Super depth. Have enjoyed it so far. Don't care about the monetization. I feel like I still only understand ten percent of the total game but still I'm having a ball with it.

Just sometimes because if the RNG, I wonder if I'm playing the game or the game is playing me.
Imagine if having every hat in Team Fortress 2 influenced every game you played.

That's Artifact, a great idea, well excecuted but horribly monetised.


This is a fantastic card game for veteran players and deckbuilders. I've put about 50 hours into the game at the time of writing, and am still having just as much fun as when I first started. This really rewards players who are willing to invest the time and energy into taking a deep dive into deckbuilding and gameplay strategy, as I've seen my winrrate steadily climbing in both Expert Constructed and Keeper Draft despite reaching higher MMRs.

Pros: 
+ Gameplay Depth
+ Fast Matchmaking
+ Draft Mode
+ Very Diverse Meta 
+ Really Rewards Skilled Players (consistent 5-0's is very doable)
+ Great Discord Community

Cons:
- True Cost of the Game is closer to $60-70 (to build a competitive deck for Expert Constructed)
- Not Enough Cards have Flashy Animations
- $20 Paywall will turn off a lot of traditionally F2P players
- Current in-game progression is really just building Steam Wallet, card collection, and racking up Perfect Runs
- No save replay feature




In Hearthstone, I can grind thirty 5-minute matches over the course of two and a half hours in order to afford one card pack daily, provided I win every single game. 

In Artifact, I can pay $0.50 or less and get five cards from the Market, the exact cards I want/need, and actually play the deck I want.

This game is being review bombed because people would rather play a deck they don't enjoy for hours on end in order to be able to "afford" the deck that they want for free, as opposed to what Artifact actually does, which is allow you to get the pieces you need when you need them. *You do not have to grind some dust equivalent or even hope for RNG packs if you just buy off of the market at $0.10 a card*.

If you value your money over your time, this is not a game for you. Sorry, it's not. You need to accept that. When cards have $$$ attached to them, they cannot be given out for free.

If you value your time over your money, and want to play what you want, when you want, without having to worry about effeciency, "I'll play Warlock because that'll give me 60g, even though I have no Warlock cards/don't like playing warlock" or anything similar to that, Artifact is an amazing game with a great amount of strategy involved. Games come down to the last play more often than not, and you can always point to a specific moment that won or lost you the game.
Great gameplay with enough 'free' modes that you never have to pay anything more than the $20. If you do want to buy more cards, it is quite fair compared to other digital card games.
As a dedicated Dota 2 player with over 4000 hours into that game, a dota-styled card game is perfect for me. However the launch was rough and the game was lacking many core-features. Valve listened to the community and quickly released a patch adding many important features and great changes. Artifact is similar to dota in so many ways; complex gameplay with strategic elements, different lanes, abilities, items and heroes. Gameplay is great - the effects, the music, the characters interactions with each other and the lore and voices behind the cards. 

I would say that the business model is fair, I like that you can buy the cards you want without opening a lot of packs, but also the free gamemodes that don't require you to spend any money at all. I've been playing the "call to arms" event-decks and won a lot, resulting in higher level, earning more cards and tickets. RNG is a factor, yes, but it also keeps the game interesting for replayability. Just like with Dota 2 the developers keep updating the game and adding awesome features and improvements. Dota 2 is one of the most balanced and fair games on the market and Artifact is moving in the same direction. 
I would highly recommend Artifact even to players that don't like MOBAS or Dota 2. Artifact is the best card game I have ever played and I'm excited to see all the upcoming patches, new cards and further improvements! As it stands Artifact is a great game, but could be further improved by adding more cards, more hero colours and some stats to the player profile. I am sure that Valve will pull this off as they have already made many positive changes in only a few weeks time.
Awesome game. When rankings get added it will be complete. 

Complaints about monetization are ridiculous. Unlike Hearthstone, you have control over what you buy and [u]you can resell it[/u].
Good game. Most of the cards in the game range anywhere from 1 cent to a few dollars for certain specific cards. By buying the game you also have access to draft mode for free forever. You also have access to premade event decks which can be a nice change of pace. You can make good decks with very few rares for under 10 dollars. Maybe even under 5 in alot of cases. 

People are looking at the game from hearth stones perspective which is incorrect for a comparison. People also mention that you can't progress without spending money but it really depends on what you consider progressing. People aren't looking at it from the perspective of having fun from a few matches of artifact but looking at it from a perspective of just playing the matches to try and grow their collection. The fun is from the matches.
I'm about to lay down a few secrets for you and then you can make a legitimate decison about buying this game. This is a real card game. Deep. Complex. Fun. A little bit of RNG that makes me want to pull my hair out sometimes, but also leaves an uncertainty that makes every match exciting. Here's why this is the best card game I have played in the 6 years of card game experience I have.

-You may think that $20 plus buying cards to be super meta(super meta decks are between 20-60 bucks)makes this not worth your while. But I assure you that isnt the case.

-In other card games, the meta cost varies usually between 100-3000 dollars. Usually the higher end is what wins and it's nuts. In this game, relatively cheap and easy.

-Phantom draft is for those who dont want to spend much money. You get to open 5 packs on the spot to make a deck and use. It only costs a ticket to enter(you start with 5) and you reearn the ticket as well if you get 3 wins with only 1 loss. you get 1 to 2 packs as well if you get 4/5 wins. This is crazy, allow me to explain why.

-When you go to your local game/cards store it costs 15 dollars usually to participate in a tournament of maybe 30 people and have a chance to win some packs(or in store credit) usually the packs vary between 16 for the winner and 4 for the bottom of the top 8. In Artifact you only need to beat 5 people and are allowed 1 loss to get all your money back and 2 pack.

In short, this game is a godsend to the card game genre with excellent gameplay and a good pricetag. Most people in the reviews screaming about microtransactions have no idea what they are talking about. Buy if you like deep strategyu card games.
Complex strategy game with depth and subtlety. Worth a try for $20 since phantom drefting is free. Card market looks cheap already if you are looking at constructed, seems better to me than buying endless packs or dusting
After the 1.2 Patch, I felt like giving it a thumbs up now, because Valve actually listened, changed their approach for the players (yes, they only do it for the $$ but let's see below what changed)

-There's progression system now, u can earn card packs, ticket and portrait when you level up your account, hurray for free digital stuff
- Quite a few controversial cards balanced, i bet you didn't know that cards can be balanced, welcome to the digital card game.
- Weely bonus XP ideally for people with not much free time can still enjoy leveling up their account gradually.
-There's a rating system now, separated for both draft and constructed
-Game actually feel great now, most match will be extremely close, you will get frustated, content, excited and down to devastated mood swing all in a single game

Although i'm changing this review into a thumbs up, but the game still has many frustating things :
-Still RNG heavy, i had a game where my row has 15 units on it and got fucked in the butt by a single Tidehunter Ravage, from outright winning to losing the next turn by only a button click, what are the odds right?
-You still have to put some money in... eventually in order to progress more since they stopped rewarding tickets and packs at level 16, but getting there takes quite some time so let's wait some more and see if the next patch add some more to it

That's about it, the game has skyrocketed in playtime/value so get playing while it's still hot
Really fun. Games feel pretty dynamic and I've never felt like I lost a game and there wasn't things I could have done differently. Game is way better than Hearthstone and Shadowverse.
When the game first came out I could not recommend it. However the patches have been great.

- Card prices have come down.
- They've added several modes I enjoy like the Bot Guantlet vs random AI decks.
- The progression system now gives free decks and tickets. (15 free packs by lvl 16)
- They've balanced all the OP cards.

For $20 I think I can solidly recommend this to others now.

The king is dead, long live the king! (c)

I was lucky and had a chance to play this game in closed beta and I spent plenty of time fighting and figuring out how to beat the shit out of my enemies.

Benefits:
-Valve and their first game in 10 years
-Makes you think and think a lot
-Different strategies to defend and attack
-Great graphics, animations, music
-Design, they made it great, especially for those who've played 1000 hours in Dota 2
-This game will have support from Valve for the next decade for sure

Cons:
-That's really hard

This game isn't a pay to play(win). Even if you got lucky and get the full card set, you won't win the game. There are enough free matches to play with real rivals. Don't listen to those who says that, simply open youtube or twitch and have a look. 

PS Volvo give diretide now in Artifact

PSS See you guys on the virtual table

I love this game. I've played a lot of TCGs and there's good and bad to all of them. You don't need to grind with 'bad decks'to unlock good deck content is my biggest sell on this game. 

However, it has it's downsides. Right now there's a lot of complaining about a stale constructed meta. This will be solved with the release of future sets just like every other card game out there. Grinding games with lower tiers of cards breeds strategy and understanding of the impact of many cards. Because high attack, low hp heroes and heroes with armor are common now and easy to win with barreling down lanes, it's copied as the easiest win condition.  There is a lot of depth to this game. These cards won't hold value for long. Not grinding leads to 'simple' builds and not being able to learn the counters. 

Play the game long enough and you'll see what I mean.

I love constructed, I love draft, and almost have a complete set for free just by winning. 10/10.
Best card game I've ever played.

Despite people complaining about it being expensive to play, it's actually the cheapest card game out if you plan on making purchases.
I grew up playing card games such as pokemon and yu-gi-oh and then transintioned into magic the gathering in my teens and early 20's. I have dabled with all the online options Hearthstone being my fav until today. This is is by far my favourite card game of all time and I believe it rightfully deseveres that title. There is seemingly limitless depth and potential to this game. Everyone saying the card econmy is terrible for the player i don;t belive they have actuall played the game. Going infinte on your rewards is very reasonable, 12 cards a pack, only 3 rarties with all of them in every pack, extra cards can being discechnated for tickets with just 1 you can a ton of rewards..... 

I'm rambling a little bit here it's the morning...  but what i'm trying to say is GET THIS GAME! try it yourself for a couple hours check out the card econcmy yourself I truly believe the hive mind of the internet got it very wrong this time ... I really hope it doesn't effect the growth and development of the best card game ever !
I have had way more fun with this game than I expected. I have 14 hours of play in 5 days since release.
Note: The only mode I play is casual Phantom Draft, so I will be reviewing it accordingly.

Pros:
- deepest strategic gameplay of any card game of its type (not just tactical, but strategic)
- free to play after $20 purchase price
- quite varied decks, both yours and your opponents'
- no downside to experimenting, learning on the go, etc
- gameplay itself is very fun, just the right pace to be able to think, not very RNG dependent at all
- it's fun just to play one or two games (not so much compulsion to play "just one more" -- as an adult with a job I value this)

Cons:
- wish I could communicate with opponents, especially to say "wow, you boomed me" after a good play
- sometimes you get matched against a noob and it doesn't feel satisfying to win
- currently there is no "ranking" system, so no artificial progression to keep you playing after you're bored. (maybe this should be a pro? I don't find it a problem)
No ladder , no progression , no quests, no way to get cards without spending real money . Expert constructed full of Axe and Phantom Assasins just so people can show off their mighty credit cards . The core gameplay is fun but it's overshadowed by greedy monetization . Pls donate $ so I can learn game.
EDIT: I'll leave the review up just so you know the horrid state this game was at launch. Thankfully Valve has listened to player feedback and at this point all my issues with the game have been solved. This game is now fun .
The game is pretty bare-bones currently; it is missing a progression system (rewards included), casual ranking system, stats page/profile, a spectating feature, and a few other minor things. That being said, the core gameplay is fun and decently complex and a lot of my time has been spent just thinking up and creating fun deck ideas. The matches are fair (in my experience at least) and the ability to buy any card I need whenever I want is nice. Overall, I would recommend this game if you are already a fan of other tcg's (ex: Magic) and don't mind waiting for the game to recieve needed improvments
As a player of many tcg  games (hearthstone, magic, yu-gi-oh, legends) I feel confident in saying this is the funnest of them all. At 20 dollars entry fee I was skeptical but you only need to own cards for constructed. I spent about 15 dollars on cards I didnt get from my 10 packs. (I bought one of every card I was missing plus some rares I liked.) So throught the first expansion I have spent 35 dollars. That is way less then any other tcg I play. The market takes the rng out of getting the cards you want. Plus phantom draft (my favorite mode) doesnt use your card pool it uses all the cards.

Great gameplay
Great value
Great strategy

I recommend to anyone who enjoys competitve tcg's.
Great game.  Have been playing HearthStone since release (have over 1000 arena wins) and can defintely say this game will be easier on my wallet than HS ever was :)
Yay Valve release a new game! It's pretty fun from what I've played so far, quick games and easy to understand rules. People complaining about purchasing card must have never played a trading card game before. $20 gets you 10 packs, which basiaclly gets you started. The deck builder is flexiable and easy to use. Hope it comes to mobile, seems like something that would be fun to play on the go.
Absolutely amazing game from a game design perspective. The depth and complexity of this game may seem intimidating at first for new players but if you manage to get past the 10 hr mark it gets better. This game has a high skill ceiling, every action you take can win or lose you the game, the order you play your cards also have a very huge impact on the round. 
Many people are saying this game is P2W or P2P. It's cheaper to build a tier 1 deck in this game than in any other CCG just because of the trading system. Steam market enables you to directly buy any cards you want (90% cards are sold for less than 10 cents). In other CCG's you have to spend 100's of $$$ opening packs or spend 100's of hrs grinding for packs and even then you are not guaranteed to get the card you were chasing. This is the best monetization system for obtaining cards out of any other similar games. 

I'll try to list things I like and dislike:
++ Combat design.
++ 3 Lanes concept.
++ You can buy any card you want directly. No grinding 100 packs to get that 1 rare.
++ Free Phantom Draft. Draft is my favorite mode as I feel the constructed meta gets a bit stale because of the limited amount of cards.
++ Amazing in-game tournament system for hosting and participating in community tournaments.
++ Also as someone who has played most other CCG/TCG out there, Artifact feels fresh and more calculated than others.

-- There is a fair amount of RNG. RNG is in itself not the worst thing, there is good RNG and bad RNG. You as a player can play around good RNG by taking it into your play considerations. But bad RNG is unavoidable. There are some cards in Artifact that represent bad RNG and I think they should be changed or modified to a good RNG version.
-- Card art. After playing Gwent TWCG for a long time I was spoiled by its card art and premium/foil card animations. Card art in Artifact feels a bit duller. 
-- Lack of progression. Currently, at the time of writing this review, there is no progression system implemented in the game. Players don't get "the sense of accomplishment" and there is no ladder to gauge the skill of a player or to prove your worth as a skilled player outside of playing local tournaments.
-- Cant play 1v1 draft with your friends. Need a minimum of 4 players to play local draft. Not a deal breaker but it would be great if Valve adds 1v1 draft games.
-- Limited card pool. But it is expected since this is the first set and hopefully more will follow soon. But currently, the constructed meta is a bit stale because half the heroes are absolute trash and a handful are absolute beasts. Again an issue which will be resolved with the expansion of card sets.
For the given price of about 18€, I can recommend this game. You get 10 card packs which can be worth enough on the market to make some money back. (if you are lucky) Or you can use them to improve on the basic decks, that you are given. 
However if you only want to play constructed, you might be disappointed. There is no way to get new cards, except for buying them on the marketplace or buying card packs with real money. 
This basically means, that you can't ever be competitive without spending money. 

However, the casual draft mode is available for everyone that owns the game. This is where you can put in the hours to make this game  more than worth the pricetag. 

Also, you can use the 5 event tickets that come with the purchase to play the competitive draft mode, where you have the chance to earn a few extra card packs and actually get some thrilling games.

The "free" part of the game is definitely worth it. You might be tempted to spend more money on this game though. So be wary of that :)
Infinite drafts for free.  That alone makes this worth the initial buy in.

Valve also completely changed their mind about not making balance changes.  

A++ now.

It takes quite a bit of time to get into the game and the rythm and many people might complain about  that and the mechanics and over card design, I am not one of them. This is a good game, most RNG is controllable in some aspect, with a few notable exception (cheating death) and them having 3 "At Any Cost" turns in a row with a salve on the same blue hero or 
having consecutive "Annihillatie"  turns. Those card have their draw backs so it's not too bad. The arrow mechanics are an elegant solution to big potential boards and not having red/black heros auto win Vs Blue and weaker green heroes. Before i get too far ahead of myself i'll summarize the heroes by color.

-Red Heroes: Over statted units that allow you early board presence and general buffs to heroes(typically other reds) they have access to such notable cards as : Time of Triumph , Clear the deck , and cheap shot.

-Green Heroes: moderatley statted units typically with some kind of win more passive/effect that either protect/heal themself or other units, they have access to such cards as : Rumusque blessing, Mist of avernuss, Thunderhide pack Alpha

-Black Heros: stats weighted heavily for offense with a lot of single target removal , bonuses when fighting other heroes , general lane mobility and gold generation. With such notable cards as : Pick off , Gank, Payday, steam cannon.

-Blue Heros : under statted units with high value passives, big board clears, card draw, mana refresh for combos, they have the best spells in the game, such as : Annihilate, At any cost , thunderstorm, Divination , Conflaguration. and many, many more

TL:DR  Good game, good mechanics, Good balance, good engine. Low card diversity, but they've only released one set. Not a great monotization strategy but it's surprisingly easy to loop in phantom draft, though that may change once people improve at the game. Note i'm not playing constructed I play phantom draft and just dust all the commons sell all the rares.
Great game with tons of lore and card interactions. IMO you get way more than enough content and playtime for the initial price of 17,95€. If you are content with playing Phantom Draft (where you draft a completely new Deck from random Cards) and sniping the oocasional card from the market, then I'd recommend giving this game a try. It's funny, it's exciting, it's gripping what more can you really wish for.

(First digital TCG I've played, so forgive me if I am not the most knowledgeable in this subject.)
Worth the sticker price just for the phantom draft mode that you can play endlessly without additional cost. Not sure if I'll be onboard for constructed or not. It's a bit stressful and demoralizing at the start, but when a game goes well it's quite the rush.
This is one of the most innovative CCGs games I have seen, been having a lot of fun with it. Coming from a heavy player of MTGO, the monitization model does not bother me in the slightest, this is WAY better. Yes, it costs money to play and is not some F2P bullshit, it is worth the money.

*edit* Fixed a typo
I'm not a typical TCG or deck building card game type of person but I greatly enjoy playing Artifact! It hits all the sweet spots that I enjoyed in the following ways:

1. Plays more like a strategic board game where you should be planning your moves in advance along with some backup exit/retaliation strategies.
2. Positional play, such as in poker, is very valuable.
3. Comeback potential huge. I know everyone says the red deck is OP but the game is not as straightforward as that. The right combination of cards can neuter a red deck by the second round.
4. I love dota lore, voice actors and interactions between cards are high quality.
5. Pretty good emphasis on social play / playing among friends. We're really into discussing what cards we have / strats related to it right now.
6. Lastly, teaches you accountability because now you have no one but yourself to blame for your shitty decision making, a self-reflective skill sorely missing in most people.

To address the monetization:
-Packs cost 2.50 CAD, game costs 26.99 CAD and you receive 10 packs with that initial cost. You are effectively paying 1.99 CAD for access to the game.
-Have you ever played a TCG with that one friend who decides to unload thousands of dollars on ultra rare cards and sets that you have no hope of playing against with your $50 deck? Yeah well let's see them try to unload thousands of dollars now, when you can build effective decks for pennies. Literally, pennies. Like, walk around and pick up a few coins off the sidewalk amount of pennies.
-Are you worried that not having access to every single card puts you at an unfair disadvantage to your opponent? Trust me, having all the cards is not going to make you a better player.
I haven't put enough time in yet for a full review, but so far it's great. People are review bombing it because of the paid cards, but overall it's a lot more fair than something like Hearthstone - you can play Phantom Draft and other decks for free, you just have to pay for decks that you want to keep or to play in for-prize tournaments. 

Game itself is super fun, will flush this review out after more time in it.
Don't believe the hate. The game is original and very well done, some gamers are just getting more and more entitled every year. You already get a great experience out of the box without spending a dollar more.
I've spent a few hours with this one.  

The skill ceiling is intensely high, the free drafting/tournaments are worth the $20 alone, and now that the marketplace is settling, constructed is affordable to get into.

I spent $200 on packs, and once market was live I sold all my dupes, bought the cards I was missing, and STILL ended up with $146 in steam wallet funds.  Game is plenty generous if you're willing to watch some streams on how to draft, and most importantly, when you lose, you actually feel like you could learn from what you did wrong.  

Coming over from Gwent and Hearthstone, while I miss Gwent's extreme generosity and free-to-play air, this game blows both out of the water in terms of raw fun and intellect.  Can't wait to see what the future holds.
When the majority of the game's reviews are negative because this game isn't free like Hearthstone.

The game is great, don't be a cheap a$$ and just pay the $20.
After playing in the beta, I must say that I'm positively surprised about the game.

What the initial 20$ purchase nets you is 2 preset decks, 10 booster packs (containing 12 cards each, that will contain at least 1 hero, 2 items, 1 rare and 3 uncommons with each common and uncommon having a 5% chance of upgrading their rarity) and 5 event tickets (that allow you to play in different pay2play game modes).

The good thing is that the game has a free casual draft mode and you can play draft tournaments with four friends. Even if you don't want to spend more money on the game, the free draft alone is worth the initial price tag. The game is extremely fun and strategic, doesn't play like any other card game. Every match feels extremely close and when you lose you just know you could have done something different to entirely change the outcome of the match.

If what you are interested in is the constructed game mode, you will have to buy cards either by gambling on booster packs on buying directly from the steam market. While rare cards will be expensive (most expensive ones will be Heroes, which make the core of any deck), you can get common and uncommon cards for dirt cheap on the steam market and making a pauper deck will cost 3$ TOP. I've tried tinkering around with pauper decks and you can get one for as low as 0.50$.

You can also allow friends to play with your decks, even if they don't own the cards.

Valve may add a 1v1 free draft mode in the future, right now the tournament supports a minimum of four players.
Well, -I- like it.

I like that the monetization is closer to real life CCGs, and that it represents a barrier of entry for the less ambitious profiteers and other bloodsuckers who prey on FTP games.

I like that the hottest card in the set is only $25.00 and that I only need a single copy of it, instead of having to pay $300.00+ on a playset which may become obsolete two months into the season.

I like that the game is proposing new ideas and concepts instead of simply rehashing known ones from 1993.

I like that I don’t have to socialize with my opponents if I don't want to, since players will always find ways to be assholes, even when they only have emotes or quotes to work with.

I like the multiple lanes, the towers, the heroes, the shopping phase, the carry-over damage and the unlimited number of units on the field or of cards in hand, as they all create new design space for the developers.

I like the RNG and the symmetricity of it, and how it makes the game more organic and less like a math puzzle.

I like the length of the matches as it provides time for players to manage randomness, correct mistakes and build strategies.

I like the number of ways I can play the game, from solid bot matches, to free drafts, to creating my own tournaments.

I like that the game makes me feel like a battlefield commander instead of like a lone wizard slinging spells at some random opponent.

So yeah, I like it.
If you are to read other review, you would notice that main complaint is Valve's monetization format. What you will NOT find in those reviews, however, is the comparison to similar games in the genre. In Artifact, you can build pretty much any deck with cards you want for a fairly low cost (I managed to create myself a fun one for about $1.20) WITHOUT having to open packs and hope. Compare it to something like heartstone where you either buy pack or spend a fairly considerable amount of time farming dust to craft cards.

Game's economy is also community managed so once post-launch craze goes off, prices should become more than reasonable. Valve eliminates the extremes of catering to totally free players and complete whales and narrows the field to spending between 20 dollars to a few hundred.

Oh, and its also fun and complex game with some really interesting mechanics (tho you better pray to RNGesus)

TL,DR: Fun game, monetization is not as bad as people make it to be, recommend 

p.s And if you get lucky, some of the cards from your 10 starting packs could be sold for $5-$15 (tho again will probably change after game launch fluctuations stop)
Artifact is an amazing strategy game from a design standpoint. Don't listen to the people who are downvoting due to the monetization model. You can play infinite free drafts for the starting price of $20, and if you get good, you can play the Expert Gauntlets without losing money by selling the cards that you earn from the packs.
The real representation of a physical card game. Nothing to grind, no in-game currency. There won't be a much different between a long runner and new comer in the upcoming year. Everything can be bought on market. Except some celebrity cards, everything is effortable. Not identical but cheaper alternatives are available. Best enjoyed with a community for with your friends in weekend tournament of your own
Artifact is great. Don't listen to the review bombing. 

$20 gets you as much free phantom draft as you want which is way better then hearthstone 's arena (which you can only really play once a day) etc. both in price and fun.

You can also sell all you cards day one and recoop part of the $20 dollar cost.

Constructed does cost money, but I would rather that then the grind/f2p system where it is a chore to play and it is much more expensive then you think to be competitive. For now I am not buying constructed cards I will wait for the market to calm down and I suggest you do the same.

Playing draft tournaments with you friends is the most fun experience you can get and you don't get that same experience any where else. Drafting costs money if ever other game people compare this too.

Buy artifact the gameplay is deep and rewards great play. It isn't about playing on curve it is about playing the field, initiative, deployment etc.
This really is dota in card game format. The game is simple at its core but in combination all of the mechanics create a truly complex strategic gameplay.
The game felt pointless before the most recent update, at which they added level milestones so you could get free packs and tickets which is nice, but the reason I'm actually recommend the game now (if you wanted to try it atleast), is that Valve actually made a huge step to both improve the game and also give hope for the future of Artifact.

They show that they're willing to support the game and make changes, which is huge because they could've just keep milking the competitive players. They actually listened to community and made some nerfs/buffs to cards and even offered to buy back the cards that was sold before the patch so it wouldn't be unfair to people that bought them from the Market. Now I don't plan to pay for cards since I enjoy Draft much more so I didn't plan to buy cards/packs to make some consturcted decks, but I'm really happy for them to atleast introduce a reward system for levels so you can atleast play some constructed after a while even if you don't spend any money after buying the game. I'm really glad that Valve is atleast showing that they're willing to take risks to make the game better.
Only writing a review to do my part to mitigate the idiots who expected a hearthstone clone review bombing the economy model.

Also it costs like $1000 to build a competitive deck in MTG.
You need to spend like $250 in hearthstone to get enough dust to build a competitive deck (or spend like 400+ hours grinding).
In Artificat the game is so well balanced you can build a competitive deck with pretty much the base cards. And thats just for 2 of the 6 game modes, the other 4 you dont need any deck.

I have 20+ hours allready and I havn't even used a ticket or opened a pack yet, as im waiting till i become better at casual phantom draft then use my packs and tickets for keepers draft. Gauntlet is incredibly fun and something you never get to do in other card games. You basicly choose one of 6 balanced decks and compete with others who have access to the exact same 6 decks, its actually amazing. People review bombing this game are just idiots and you can tell by everyone with over 10 hours in the game saying how amazing. 
Rant over.
Best balanced TCG with by far the most variety throughout the decks. It's not recommended to casuals. But if you're constantly trying to improve and you love the competetive challenge, this is your game.
This game is insanely refreshing!

Pros
+ Bought 95% of a playset (3) of all cards for $55 dollars on the open market!
+ No nagging daily quests trying to lure you back
+ No disporprtionate use of aggessive strategies
+ Really fun and different game play
+ Free draft mode
+ Super polished with good details, story, and voiceover
+ Valve not censoring reviews of their own product.

Cons
- Games can take a while
- Gameplay might not appeal to everyone
BEFORE YOU READ, I'VE PLAYED TCGS FOR THE PAST DECADE+ AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY LOVE THIS GAME, I THINK IT HAS THE BEST MONETIZATION MODEL IN THE ONLINE TCG INDUSTRY AND IS ARGUABLY AS GOOD AS ANY PAPER CARD GAME.

It's been about 4-5 days after release thus far. I got into the game day 3, and I dumped 10 hours into it yesterday. It is the single most enjoyable online TCG I've ever got the pleasure to play. The monetization set up is perfect as far as I've seen so far. The prices are regulated by the market, things have stabilized pretty well so far, and it makes sense why certain things cost as much as they do, just like any other TCG secondary market. 

I think that, of note, there is little in the way of retaining casual players. Anyone who wants to be competitive in Artifact will be happy to see how many options there are, from going infinite in drafts, playing competitive constructed to test out your decks worth, all the way to playing in the numerous online tournaments. I think that there's still a lot to be found in the meta as well.

That leads me to the gameplay itself, it's such a breath of fresh air into the genre. It reminds me in many ways of Android: Netrunner, by way of the lanes, but that's where the similarities end. Every game feels different and every game usually has a TON of back and forth. It definitely feels like a very balanced game, at the time of posting it. No one has found anything specifically game-breaking as of yet, but up until then, I cannot wait to see how the meta refines.

I hope to see you unfolding the boards with me, everyone. My love for this game cannot be summarized by words. I hope this convinced someone to look past the 'mixed' rating and dive into this game.
I really do like this game. It is super fun, and gets addicting, the tutorial is really good at explaining the game, and the Dota theme/lore just fits in this card game genre. They NEED to make this available on mobile devices such as IOS/Android. It's the perfect game to pull up on your phone, while waiting at the DMV or some shit. While all this is good, it really confuses me why they decided to not make this a Free to Play. I mean I know Valve is of course greedy, and wants plenty of money, but come on... making it Free To Play would have justified the "sort of" pay to win system. It's just odd that Dota 2 is free to play..... oh the card game about Dota 2? yeah that costs $20. Still I can't not recommend this game, because it is extremely promising.
The thing I've noticed about reviews being written about the game is that there are 2 types of reviews: Either the person is complaining about the monetization model or they are loving it. 
This is because group A comes from the gaming world where f2p is a thing and people are dissapointed they think they won't be able to play Artifact. However, this is simply not true, you can play any mode in the game for free without paying an extra buck. There's a preconstructed event and there is free drafting. The thing f2p players won't be able to do is build a collection.
Group B comes from the cardgaming world of things like MTG, HS, Yugioh etc etc and they all think: OMG this game is so cheap yet so competitivly viable. (which they are, imo, right about (the competitive viability that is). This is an entirely different mindset.

Consensus: Both groups WANT to play Artifact, but some have a budget available which makes them able to play every aspect of the game and others don't have that budget. Expensive is different for each person and each person individually has to make up their mind whether they want to invest into the game or not. 
Personal opinion: We, as gamers, are not entitled to be able to play anything we want for no cost just the same as you don't feel entitled to having a Lamborghini because you bought a Renault Clio. But you can still get your mileage out of your Clio, which brings me to the part that I don't see referenced in enough reviews:

This game is simply amazing. Very complex, multiple layers of strategy, very smooth gameplay (as opposed to getting landscrewed in MTG...). There's also a huge amount of game modes and possibilities and a very active community (allthough the community currently seems a bit split up between different hubs all over the internet)
I have honestly never played a CCG before (and I've played quite a few over the years, MTG, HS, Eternal, Gwent) that gave me the same amount of hype when I win a game. Every game seems close and you can't just randomly sling cards at the board, you actually need to think your moves through preferably one or multiple turns ahead.
The satisfaction that comes from seeing that outplay you just figured out come into fruition is simply extatic.

To anyone doubting to try it out due to the reviews about the monetization model: just give it a go, the initial box cost isn't expensive and will get you many hours of fun and maybe after those you'll feel like you want to invest into a card collection, or maybe not, but you'll still have had many hours of fun for very few $.
The best way to learn the game anyway is through either the f2p Preconstructed mode or through free phantom draft mode so if you are like me and you expect a 1$/1hr played ratio from games, Artifact will very easily deliver that for it's original box cost and beyond that, everything is up to you!

A deep and tactical TCG.
If you're looking for something quick and easy to pick-up, this isn't it. 
You'd be better with Hearthstone, Gwent or Shadowverse.
I fucking love it.

Also, it IS cheaper than Hearthstone.
Change my mind.
Having a lot of fun with the game. Mostly playing phantom drafts. 

To address the "pay to win" issue. As in most card games you need the strongest cards to be competitive in constructed but instead of making you grind for days to get competitive cards the game gives you the option of buying the cards while allowing you to still sell them later to recoup some of your investement. This sounds more resonable to me that having to spend hundreds in random packs to eventually get what you need or spend hundreds of hours grinding with suboptimal cards.
There's a place called "The Game Cave" where I live. People gather and play D&D / Magic and other card games. This game is a virtual edition of real life card gaming. The costs - compared to driving to a location, buying packs, ect - is much cheaper. People are salty because they expected free this and free that. . .

I think free is good and there should be some in game currency NO DOUBT - but GEEZ PEOPLE - understand that this is a product that is paralleled with card games played in real life. With all that being said, if you understand these concepts going into it, then you'll love Artifact - and I don't even play DOTA. Cheers!
Unlike most reviews, I'm not actually bothered about the monetization scheme. They'll need some sort of income if they want to continue this for a long time and cosmetic purchases is probably not going to work. If the current way is properly balanced, time will tell. However, so far I have not had a single need to buy something else. The game simply offers too many options to play with cards that you don't own so that the desire is not really there.

As for the game itself, it's good fun to play. The only falls short on career options and statistics, but I don't really miss it that much myself. I just play it for a little fun, not to dive into expert mode games.

One thing I did notice is that games are sometimes decided by RNG. This can be partly blamed on the card selection in your deck, but also because you generally only get to see about half the cards. A simple unlucky sorting of your deck can leave you without a chance.

Bottom line, the starting pack offers plenty to warrant the purchase price. And getting into it was not too hard. And since my last card game experience was some MTG back in the 90s, I'm pretty much a noob. So if you'd like to try one , go for it and just ignore the fact that you *can* buy more stuff.
Artifact is a game that perfectly exemplifies Steam's need for a neutral review option. I'm giving this a thumbs up*. Interpret freely.
*As a game, not as a purchase.

The issue with trying to review a card game like this is whether the review is of the actual game or the value of the required entry fee. So in the spirit of being fair, let's review both.

[b]THE GAME[/b]

The game itself is great. It marries the gameplay of Magic with the structure of Dota... And it just works. The 3 lane board sounds complicated, but ends up adding a lot of strategy without slowing down the game. The core design works because every aspect of the game is simple to understand, but all the mechanics together make the decision making fairly complicated.

Artifact's presentation is also just nuts. Excellent animation, good art, and fully voiced lore for every card. Again, fully voiced lore on each card. Much of which is delivered from the perspective of individual heroes. The amount of flavor this adds is just fantastic. It's a joy to listen to all the cards. It's great to see a low-cost Windranger attack spell have lore read by Drow (her rival). Lore indicating that she's not good at shooting (according to Drow).

It's a great game that offers a good alternative to Hearthstone. Hearthstone's hook is that games are simple to understand and fast. That ends up being both its biggest strength and weakness, because the simplicity limits design space. Artifact probably won't replace Hearthstone, but offers a lot more decision making and counter-play over longer games.

What is left to be seen is the effect that RNG will have in Artifact's competitive scene. To be specific, RNG referring to random effects other than the inherent luck of card draw. Random effect BS nearly killed Hearthstone at a competitive level. It probably still hurts it. Artifact brings in a lot of it too, let's just hope Valve's design team knows to pull back if it becomes too much.

[b]The Entry Purchase[/b]

And here is the other aspect of reviewing Artifact. The one that is probably a thumbs down for a lot of players. The game costs 20 dollars to start. It's still essentially a F2P game, but your forced to pay out for 2 starter decks, 10 packs, and 5 tickets.

The other important thing you get access to is phantom draft. A free drafting mode where you draft from cards outside of your collection. You can play this forever and its practice mode for the real draft (where you pay in and keeps the cards, you don't keep cards in phantom draft). This was added due to outcry during the beta, since all of the competitive modes cost entry fees. And for 20 bucks, being able to play phantom draft infinitely is arguably a good value for your money.

From a card collection standpoint though, the value is barely over just buying 10 packs. Barely. It will probably leave most players unsatisfied for a couple reasons.

First, those 2 starter decks are hot garbage. If you ever played a card game back in the 90s, you'll remember starting off with starter decks and feeling like you got a jumpstart into the fun. Not here. Your starter decks consist mostly of terrible commons that you'll dupe in 10 packs. Really none of the cards here have any value because everyone has to buy the same 2 decks and that makes every card here completely worthless and pennies on the market.

The 10 packs are obviously RNG. I got Axe. Axe is Axe. He's also the most desired card of the expansion. I could cash out of Artifact and make money. Most players won't be this lucky.

So what does 10 packs and 2 starter decks get you? The inability to craft any sort of meaningful deck. The game has 4 color archetypes all heroes/spells/creeps are tied to those colors. You'll probably end up with a large spread that can't effectively do anything without buying cards to fill in gaps. Realistically, you'll need to pay in again another 10-15 bucks at minimum to get a useful deck. More if you want certain key cards with much higher power levels.

This leads to the biggest strength and weakness of the current monitization. Ranked is the only way to earn free packs. Ranked costs an entry fee ticket (these cost real money, you get 5 free). This is a gauntlet of 5 matches with the same deck that is double elimination. Winning 3-5 matches refunds your ticket and gets you a pack depending on how many wins.

The ticket cost is actually good because card games work best when something of value is on the line. Of course, you won't be winning with your starter decks. So the only way to earn free packs in-game is to spend more money on packs before wasting your tickets. 

[b]Is it worth it?[/b]

If you like CCGs, then yes. This is a good one. If you're planning on spending money on buying cards, this is a good game for it. Otherwise you have to just ask yourself if 20 dollars is worth unlimited phantom draft and the starter decks only mode. Because 20 dollars does not get you enough to play constructed in either casual or competitive. I'm loving the game so far, but the mixed reviews seems completely understandable.
Great card game. Valve mentioned on twitter that they are working on progression which is one thing the game is lacking. So far the only way to gain cards is to pay money or a win streak in competitive which requires you to recycle cards. You can spend 300$ to buy all the cards currently. But I don't see the point you can buy decks for 20-40$ or just do draft and make your own decks cost free to try out different builds. Also with cards to arms you can play pre built decks and its fun and only the initial price tag. I really enjoy the game so far will play for awhile.
Best CCG/TCG I've played, and a far less insidious pricing model than Hearthstone.  Great depth and complexity. Would recommend to anyone who's interested in a fun, serious, intricate game.
I do not have an opinion about the monetization of the game... yet. I do not mind having to pay for more cards to bring more options to your gameplay as long as it's balanced and not P2W. I do not have evidences that the game is actually P2W. I don't have enough PvP experience to be able to tell either. But the way a TCG works, and the way the business model is, I'm a tiny bit worried about what the game may become and I may change my review in the future if Valve proves themselves incapable of keeping the "balance vs monetization" in check.

But otherwise, great gameplay, great mechanics, great interface, great soundtracks. Overall very pleasant to play, doesn't feel too RNG heavy and offers good complexity without feeling convoluted. If you're into card games, no reason to pass on this one.
Anyone rating this game negatively is just upset that the game is not free to play.  If you played MTG or any other card game how did you start out?  You probably bought a starter deck then started buying booster packs for extra cards to flush out your deck.  Don't let having to spend some money on cards deter you from picking up this game.  It has provided way more enjoyment and excitment then I have ever got out of hearthstone.  The fact you can flesh out your deck on the steam market is well thought out as well.  You can create a deck then click a button to purchase any cards your missing.  You can also simply sell all of your duplicates on the market.  A+ card game coming out of valve, don't let the monetization scheme stop you!
95% of reviews are about monetization, so this is too. Compared to all competition it is actually in a really good place at the moment. Significantly cheaper to play competitively than MTGO or Hearthstone once you stop believing in grinding for a year every 6 months. And casual play starts at only ~2$ up-front (value of packs may vary) since you can sell whatever you get from your starting packs and stick to free drafts.
The game is fantastic and has loads of depth and decisions to make, despite being an experienced card game player I have found myself making unforced errors fairly often. Currently I'm only playing draft, but I have had a fantastic time doing so, and being able to casual draft for no cost forever is great. Most card games have rng, but I can only think of two occasions so far where I got a little frustrated with it (cheating death being one of those occasions). For the most part I barely even notice the rng in some actions because I'm making so many decisions afterwards, and generally you can do quite a lot to control and combat it.

Constructed has some level of buy in, but the market lets you know how much things will cost beforehand as a buy in. This is a pretty similar amount to most other digital card games (cheaper than some) for a top end deck based on analytics done by players, with the added bonus that you can always sell the cards if you are done with them.

While there is no visual progression to grind for, I'm just enjoying playing and getting better at the game.
TL;DR: The game is great and the paymodel is fair.

Okay, so while most of us agree that the gameplay itself is great and kind of unique, I see a lot of people having problems with the paymodel Valve uses in their newest game Artifact. Now my question to them is; ever played MTG? Ever played Yu-gi-oh? Or duel masters? The list goes on and on. Do you know what those card games have in common? You don't get stuff for free. You see, the fact that Hearthstone introduced "gold" as a means to expand your collection by playing doesn't make it the standard practice in these games... but you know what? I'd get all of the backlash and even support it if the pricing was unfair. Packs cost 1.75€ at the moment. You know what I can get for 1.75€? A pack of chips. I could also buy a pack every week and it would still cost less than paying for WoW, in comparison - yet that game has tons of players still to this day. The next thing I'd like to talk about is the price of the game itself. I've seen complaints about how you have to buy the game and then still pay for packs. Now, if you use your mathematical knowledge you could easily calculate out that the 17.95€ price of the game is roughly equal to the price of 10 packs which you, surprise, get with the purchase, along with 2 whole decks. Think about it; what you buy isn't really the "game itself", but the cards so you can start playing. Again if you think back to MTG or Yu-gi-oh, you never had to buy the game, that's true, but unless you bought a bunch packs you couldn't play and so technically it's the same thing here. It was just easier to implement it this way rather than making a free-to-play game that you could start up but couldn't actually play unless you bought cards for it.
Oh well, just my two cents.
The gameplay is great and people are massively exaggerating the cost of the game. I've been playing a lot of causal draft (which is totally free) and I've been loving it.
Legit my favorite card game since Magic the Gathering. Tons of depth to the strategies and cards themselves. You can buy tons of cards for cheap. Most common cards only cost $0.05, so getting all the commons in the game is very cheap. Even a bunch of uncommons and rares can be bought for cheap, then traded among friends. Or you could try and get an expensive card for a low price, then sell high to buy a bunch of other cards. This market system makes cards actually feel like they have value, unlike other digital card games. It also allows you to just buy the cards you want without having to grind for packs, or buy hundreds of packs untill you're lucky enough to get the specific card you want to make a deck. Overall, it has blown me away with its complexity and addictive gameplay. I'd recommend it to any card game fan.
GREAT game, its TECHNICALLY pay to win, yet any TCG (trading card game) including in real life, is pay to win, you can just be gifted the best cards ahah, you recieve 10 packs to start and you can use pre built decks. you can also share decks with your friends.
there is a drafting option in the game too which is really fun, i just wish people would stop complaining and just give the game a chance !
It's a game based off older TCG without a skinner's box tricking you into thinking all the time you're wasting not being competitive by grinding freee packs is worth it. The amount of people that tell me that f2p games are better, and that they spent 200 hours or so in Hearthstone, but then admit they spent money anyway to actually be competitive blows my mind.

Progression is coming soon and there's plenty of free modes for fun, you just don't earn packs for them. You know, like actual board games/card games where you play for fun.

The game itself is what's most important though, and it's easily the most fun card game I've ever played. It'll only get better once more cards get added and a few RNG cards like Cheating Death and heavy schlong cards like Axe are tweaked or countered by new cards.
This game is well worth the $20. I started off by opening my packs, selling anything that had some value, and I got back half of the price of the game straightaway. For now I'm enjoying the free phantom draft mode, and once I feel a little more confident I'll go ahead and try the competitive version.
Okay I just played for a few hours I know, but I spent more time on the game rather than those 0.5 hours and leave a bad review. 

Artifact is basically:
- Not a free game
- No grind, no in-game currencies, no dailies
- You bought cards from either packs or individual cards from Steam Market (way cheaper and no gambling!)

The game modes:
- Solo Play: You play with bots, in other words practice mode
- Social Play: You play with friends (openly or challenge) and make your own tournament!
- Expert Play: You need entry ticket (not free!) and you can win prizes but there are 3 modes in this:
Expert Constructed: Play using your own deck and challenge other people's deck
Phantom Draft: Play using given 60 cards and challenge other people's
Keeper Draft: Play using given 60 cards and if you win you can keep the cards!

What people get wrong: 
"You need to pay to win". Not entirely true. The only mode that might have this advantage is Expert Constructed, which has very niche people playing. Phantom Draft and Keeper Draft are better modes with the same (even better) rewards.
"Need to pay to enter ranked mode". Again, not entirely true. You can recycle duplicate cards for even tickets.
"Gambling and lootboxes". Not entirely true. You can buy each cards individually. Nobody sane will buy packs.

TL:DR: This game has controlled and secured market price for the cards (supply & demand) and only fools get trapped with gambling or buying useless things. The cards are way cheaper compared to other card games. You don't even need to have all cards, that Expert Constructed is not even challenging and worth your ticket. Artifact is an enjoyable and very in-depth game that can sucks you hours of playing even by paying once.
What you get for 20 dollars:

1) Starter Packs
2) Some *Expert Mode* tickets
3) The ability to play Casual Constructed however many times you want
4) The ability to play Casual Phantom Draft however many times you want

Pros:
1) It's really complex and fun. Takes a while to wrap your head around but one decision can cost you the entire game, and vice versa. The gameplay is deep and rewarding.
2) Someone did the maths and it's 200 USD to buy the entire set of cards right now; certainly better than Hearthstone or any other CCG on offer.
3) If you're missing a card, you can just buy it instead of opening 500 card packs and hoping you get it, or get enough trash to scrap and then craft what you want.

Cons:
1) Casual doesn't give rewards (in terms of expanding card collections),
2) If you want to go "infinite", you need 3 wins. Therefore, you can technically get a full collection by only buying the 20 dollar base game, but you'd have to go 3+ wins every time you spend a ticket. If you go 4 wins, you can get a pack + your ticket back. Then, with 5 of those under your belt, you can then go into Keeper Draft, where you keep every single card you draft, and then whatever you win. So technically, you can go "infinite" but you'd have to be very good. 
3) Some of the games mechanics like creep spawns and attack arrows feel very RNG.
4) People can buy cards, meaning people who spend more money will have better cards (but when is this not true for card games? Before you say "I got a full collection without spending any money in Hearthstone", time is money.)

NOTE: You can spend ZERO dollars beyond your intial on this game and still have fun. This isn't some system where you literally have to pay to play. You can still play casual constructed and draft, and that's what I plan to do.

Personally, I'd wait for a sale.
Artifact is the best CCG ever made. What I mean by that, is the gameplay is the best ever.

Now, like most people, would prefer that every set was a set amount to spend to get every card and I wish that keeper draft wasn't so expensive. I don't think packs should be $2 each and I will never be buying them at that price.

I don't care about ladders and progression, because that's not why I play a game for. I'm more interested in tournaments and playing socially, then getting a shiny achievement for making to the top of the ladder. I know there's people out there that wants that and I can understand why, because it's been in almost every online game lately. It's nice to see something different.

I will say that this game already has more options in it than almost any online CCG that I've seen before. User tournaments are awesome and may be the greatest thing in the game. If they can add in drafts for 2 people, that would make it even better.

It's still very new and features are missing in the game, like chatting and social groups. But this is Valve, they are known for their social options and I know they will be coming.

This is a game that I plan on playing for a long time. I played Magic for over 25 years and I've already dropped that game for this. I can't wait to see what they do with more advanced mechanics in future expansions.
I bought the game for 18 euros, opened 10 packs that were given for free got 12 euros back, so basically got the get for barely 6 euros. 
[list]
[*]The draft mode has a free version, paid version and a paid keeper version(you can find out more about them if you just look it up, don't wanna explain it all). Draft is what's fun for me and is more skill related than constructed, IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT CONSTRUCTED LIKE ME, THIS GAME IS GONNA BE VERY FUN. I got 9 tickets from the common cards that i got from the 10 starter packs, leaving me with 14 tickets after i play a ton of casual and feel good enough to join in the competetive setting.

[*]If you wanna play constructed, you might want to open up your wallet JUST like any other card game, but there you would have to battle rng and spend a lot more money than just buying the decks you want from the market. In Artifact you can go to a market and fully build a deck of your liking(could be 5-20$ decks which you couldnt do in other card games, cause there you have to battle RNG and open a sh*t ton of packs) and then when you're done with it you can just sell it back for like 70% of money you spent and try building a new deck.

The worst thing about this game are the consumers that are raging all over the internet about "P2W" and saying how bad this game is and turning people off from even trying it.

- The game definetly isn't bad, it's quite fun and kinda cheap if you don't care about constructed.

- P2W? Yes, IN CONSTRUCTED, just like every other card game you have to open your wallet up and spend money to be competetive in constructed(like said in this game it is probably cheaper to get a deck going than other games where you have to spam open packs, also you can just sell your cards after you're doen and build a new deck like i mentioned aswell), but this game focuses on draft mode quite a bit and might be the main "mode" to play, so if you are not a fan of preconstructed decks and money spending, this game is not p2w at all.

- These consumers want everything free and everything put in their mouths without having to do anything, it's a mob mentality, they refuse to find anything good about the game and just scream "P2W" "volvo sucks" "dead game" etc. it's a clown fiesta without any real feedback about the game itself. What a surprise people are angry about not getting the game for free and every single card given to them on install.

TLDR; baby ragers will cry about P2W aspect for a while till they turn off everyone from the game, if you don't wanna listen to them just buy the game, open packs, sell the cards while the prices are fluctuating and high and you get a game for a very low price and then you can play draft and have fun till they introduce more cards and ways to get free packs.
[b]DRAFT MODES > CONSTRUCTED[/b]
[h1]Pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Three Boardstates - This is what sets the game apart from MTG and Hearthstone. Managing your boards and knowing when and where to throw your resourses is key.
[*]Mechanics - Similar enough to Magic that any player of MTG will feel at home, but just different enough to feel new and fresh.
[*]Free Play - I enjoy that I can fire up a standard draft and practice as much as I want before throwing myself into prize play. Same thing for constructed, I played probably 10-15 matches in casual honing my deck before bringing it into prize play.
[*]User Interface - From the matches to the menus to the deck building it's all layed out beautiflly. Everthing is very intuitive and user friendly.
[*]Graphics & card art - Card illistrations are fantastic. The board and little helper imps are very well done. I like all the subtle animations like the little river running through dividing the play space and the helper dragons reacting to the action on the board.
[*]Ranks and Progression - A much needed update. They give you nice incentives to play every week. You gain experience from matches played and modifiers you've earned throughout a match. As you level up you unlock event tickets and packs, up to a max of 10 packs and event tickets per season. It sounds like seasons will last about a month each.
[/list]

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
[list]
[*]$20 price tag - Do I feel like it's worth it? Yes and No. They give you 2 starter decks, 10 packs (Each containing atleast 1 rare, and normally cost $2 each), and 5 event tickets. I feel like without any further investment you could have 20 hours of fun playing casual without any further investment. If you pull an Axe or Drow in your 10 packs you could probably try your hand at expert (Or sell them to bolster your deck.)
[*]Prize play - it's set up well enough. You wager a ticket ($1) to play, if you win 3 matches before you lose 2 you get your ticket back. If you win 4 matches you get a booster, win 5 get two boosters. My only problem with the system currently is that you need to invest like $10-40 to be competitive (based on the card economy as of December 1st, 2018) or be really good at drafts.
[/list]

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Cannot trade with friends - I understand the reasoning behind it. They don't want to repeat the problems they've had with csgo (gambling and scamming), but the fact that I cannot give my spare cards to a friend just sucks. Seriously, just making cards only tradable to people you've had on your friends list for 30 days and put a cap on the max number of cards you can trade per day/week. I'd be happy.
[*]Steam market & card economy - I view this from 2 different perspectives, and neither is great. From a PC gamer perspective it's a joke, $20 for a game should allow me to be competive as I put more time into the game, not more money. From a Magic players perspective it doesn't feel like a bad deal, that probably says more about Magic than it does about Artifact though. When I started the game I put about $30 into buying cards and felt like I had a pretty solid deck (total $50 investment.) Let's compare that to magic: If I bought them discounted online, $50 might get me a preconstructed deck (60 card deck with some rares) and a "fat pack" (10 fifteen card booster packs, some lands, a d20, and a sturdy card container.). With only those two products, even if you were a great deckbuilder, you'd likely get stomped at a Friday Night Magic. The other consideration to that comparison is that you are atleast getting physical cards that you can sell without Valve taking a 15% cut.
[*]In conclusion, the monetization isn't good, but I don't think it's a dealbreaker. You don't need to buy 3 of every card in the game. Play the free preconstructed decks to figure out the colors you like. Focus on one or two colors and only buys cards for those colors. Once you get a competetive deck you can earn the rest of your cards in expert constructed (or expert drafts.) The core gameplay is fun enough that I'm willing to put up with Steam's marketplace.
[/list]
A unique take on card games and the Dota2 universe. This game offers plenty of play options for the $20 price point and is extrememly accessible compared to other card games. Individual cards for the most part are cheap and it's easy to pick up individual cards to complete a deck that is somewhat competitive, instead of grinding for hours or buying $1 or $2 a pack to gamble for a card that is on the market for $0.03. The game also has free to play practice games for constructed and draft decks before going into expert where you use entry tickets to win packs. It may not be a system that appeals to everybody, but it's an enjoyable experience with a realtively low cost to stay comeptitive in compared to other card games.
If you like TCGs, this is the best one on the market.  I’ve been playing this genre of game for twenty years and nothing is close.  I can’t even imagine what it will become.
Really good game, high replayability and depth at low cost thankst to free phantom draft. You have to pay up to play constructed, but 20 bucks for phantom draft is a good deal.
Always dreamed of a DotA that I could play solo without having insane mechanics of microing 5 heroes at once. I also enjoy card games so Artifact completely delivers for me.

Also personally I made my money back and more from steam market after opening the free packs and running some Gauntlet with the free tickets. So I'm effectively F2P now if I don't spend any money, likely I will spend money though since the game is a ton of fun.
Constructed is pretty bland for the most part, but draft is really fun, which is great because it means you would never have to spend more than the initial $20 as there is a free phantom draft mode
This game is tons of fun and totally worth playing. The 20 bucks gets you two decks, 10 packs, and 5 event tickets. Then you can buy the singles to finish your deck for maybe 10 bucks if you want? Easy card game to get into and I highly suggest it to MTG or HS vets!
I can’t help but think that people complaining about the monetization model are complete ignorant concerning TCG games. Especially digital ones.

Every single other game forces you to grind for packs to build decks. They have a complete RNG loot box system that you have to throw your money at to be able to be competitive.

Artifact is not like this at all. You get to choose which card you want and buy it.

Axe is 14 bucks right now at launch. Most of the other cards are below 50 cents.

How in the world of TCG could you possibly be upset about how the game is monetized?

Unless you expect all of the cards to be given to you with your 20 dollar purchase? In this case rip for the longevity of the game and future expansions.

I honestly think this is a case of the Reddit/internet hive mind. Same thing happens with every game. As soon as the bozo with the loudest voice complains about something everyone jumps on board to rally with this idiot. I’m not saying these things are never justified because there are plenty of reasons to “rally” but there are just as many misplaced ones as there are justified ones.

The monetization is something that the TCG community has been waiting for for a long time.

On top of all this the most balanced way to play (drafting) is fucking free. Casual phantom draft allows you to use all of the cards in the set for free.

This coupled with tournaments with friends is revolutionary in the realm of online TCG games so before you start rallying along with the crowd that’s against the monetization please get informed because the way valve has chosen to launch this game is a giant step in the right direction for the TCG genre as a whole.
So far so good..I did some reading and watching on game before I picked it up and I'm pretty happy I did..been looking for a real TCG not some f2p grind for gold/cards TCG..this is it..
Artifact is one of the most consumer-friendly card games on the market; provided you haven't succcumbed to Stockholm syndrome from free-to-play Skinner-boxes.  A lot of people are calling this a "pay-to-pay" or "fee-to-pay" game, which is excessive. There is a lot of stuff to do in this game with your $20 purchase. Here is a list of everything you have access to from buying the game that doesn't require any additional money:
[list]
    [*]2 starter decks (Blue-Black Control and Red-Green Brawler)
    [*]10 12-card booster packs (1 rare, 3 uncommons, 8 commons*) *5% upgrade chance
    [*]5 event tickets for Expert Constructed and Expert Draft (yield tickets and booster packs)
    [*]6 event decks for use in featured set matchmaking event and Social format with friends
    [*]Global Matchmaking, Casual Constructed, and Casual Phantom Draft 
    [*]Play with your friends' decks in Social format via loaning feature [b] -YOINK- [/b]
    [*]Solo play bot matches against 18 decks (6 event decks + 12 bot-specific decks) 
[/list]
Artifact's monetization is for people that prefer to pay for the cards they want instead of grinding [i] for a chance [/i] to get those cards.  I would rather buy 5-cent commons, 10-cent uncommons, and  30-cent rares (average prices of cards as of Dec. 10th) for the cards I need to complete my deck than spending loads of time to [i] maybe [/i] get them.  I know Magic Arena lets you use wildcards to craft the cards you want; but those are drip-fed to you at a rate I find really slow. Also, if you don't want to pay $5 for a pack of 5 event tickets in Artifact, you can trash 20 cards to make a ticket.
 
As for the actual gameplay, it's probably the most complex card game I've every played (maybe up there with Android Netrunner).  I love games that present you with several possible decisions at every step.  Magic the Gathering is great because you have to choose when to play each card in your hand.  But in Artifact, you have to choose not only when, but where.  You also need to think about when to let your heroes to die, because #1: It's beneficial to let them die so you can relocate them two turns from now. And #2: When they die, your oppenent gets gold and you can't cast cards in that lane without a hero of the same color. There's so much going on at any time (eg. cards are activating effects when they hit the board, heroes are using abilities, lane improvents are being used before or during the action phase, effects are activating when neighbor cards are destroyed, and players are using purchased items on heroes from the shopping phase).  

You also have to play around the randomness in the game, in terms of the boardstate.  Each round starts with two melee creeps being randomly spawned in random locations on the three lanes.  And three types of arrow cards (curve left, straight, curve right) are randomly placed in unblocked spaces (25% left, 50% straight, 25% right), redirecting your unblocked cards' focus of attack. 

This complexity could be paralyzing for some, but I find it very gripping.  So many of my matches come down to the wire; and it's so satisfying to win because I know so many decisions were made along the way.  If you appreciate highly strategic games, you'll love Artifact.
I wasn't sold on the game but after the update that added progression, I really liked it. I hope it is fleshed out further. Lots more potential in the game.

(I received the game for "free" by being a TI8 attendee though so I'm a bit biased.)
valve has fixed literally every single thing reddit complained about, gr8 game with ladder, bunch of free stuff and finally some balancing. 10/10 best digital card game i've played.
Since the progression update of 1.2 most of my gripes with artifact have been adressed. The game sports a fantastic set of core mechanics and the potential for very interesting interaction in future sets. Knowing the stance that valve is taking with the game currently, I have high hopes for this games future and believe that it is now worth it.
Best TCG out there. Anyone crying about payment models is, quite frankly, an idiot. How DARE they make it so you can purchase cards individually, and not force you to earn them through loot boxes or inflated virtual currencies.

$1000 for a full set of cards for hearthstone, HIDDEN behind gambling mechanics... Thats fine, but Artifact's model is bad? Get a grip kids.
There is fun to be had here without even spending money. After getting over the initial hurdle of understanding how to play (me being a complete TCG newbie), the game becomes quite fun. Playing with pre-made decks in a gauntlet mode against other pre-made decks is balanced and fun. Some decks are definitely better than others, but you can try all of them for free.

After a recent update, Valve enabled you to earn decks through levelling up (the one major criticism I had of the game before), as well as a few good balancing changes that removed some pretty rubbish RNG that existed before.

You don't have to spend money on this game. You can treat it like any other game you pay money for, and just play it for free thereafter. I've managed to make back over half the purchasing price of the game by selling off my rarest cards I got from the free/earned/starter packs. After playing long enough, it may be possible that this game effectively becomes free through selling cards. Based on that, it's hard not to recommend this game.
(Udapted 21/12/18)

The Bad (I removed every negative points except one):

- The business model is overall pretty backward and P2W. They could have sold cosmetics and/or full expansion packs instead.

The Good:

- The game is fookin good. This is best card game I played in my life. I would say it's more a turn-based strategy game than a simple card game.
- It's very, very deep. There's a ton of variety and complexity. You can play the same set of cards for hundreds of hours without figuring all the possible strategies and situations. Many things can happen, and despite the random factors, there's enough agency and a lot of mindgame potential. (Note: don't play that if you want and expect a fast mobile card game à la hearthstone. This is really something that drains all the energy of your brain.)
- Free Draft! This is basically all I play. The replayability is endless and that's the only way to play with all the cards without paying.
- The multiple premade decks("Call to Arms" atm) that can be played within a separated matchmaking queue. If you have no money and/or no time for deckbuilding, this is the easiest way to learn the game and get fair (and fun) matches.
- Creating a deck by buying cards is cheaper than you might think. If you exclude the handful of overpriced cards on the market, you can build a decent deck for 10-15euros, which is not necessary a meta deck but can be exactly the deck you want. Most cards, even some heroes cost around 0.04$.
- Valve will never give up on this game. If people keep complaining, if the game loses too much popularity, they will prefer to change their business model than letting it die. (already confirmed by the last update)
- (new) They want to continuously balance their cards instead of keeping some of them broken for the market.

Conclusion (udpated):

I really love it and I slowly considering putting money in the game because the price are just  getting lower and lower. The complaints are still fair, but If you're like me you can still have a lot of fun without buying stuff. Despite its flaws it's an amazing and unique game, and it's just the beginning.

Artifact is Valve's take in the card game industry; a card game inspired by Dota 2. Similar to its inspiration, Artifact is more complex compared to its competitions; the game features three lanes, items, and heroes from Dota 2's universe. While the game has a steep learning curve, the turorial barely explains the in-depth flow of the game but when you get the gist, it is easy to learn but hard to master. Artifact may be the Dota 2 card game but players do not need to have prior knowledge nor experience about Dota 2. Artifact is an innovation of its genre that features a vast variety of strategy and gameplay.
I have been playing the hell out of this game for the last 2 days. Let me start by saying the base game is $20 but you can buy 95% of all the other cards with an additional $8 through the marketplace. Don't waste your time on packs, by making full use of the steam marketplace you will virtually buy every card you need to make many fun and interactive decks for around 1/10th of the price of staying competitve in Hearthstone after an expansion. Only the most powerful cards are over $2 and even then you have a chance to find them in the gamemode Keepers Draft where you draft a deck of random cards and keep all the ones you draft, however this costs around $8 but is still better than just opening packs.

Now let me say this game is very deep, and bit complex and therefore is NOT for everyone. If you are looking for a casual cardgame to play while watching a movie and doing laundry, this is not for you. If you are expecting to understand all the decks and how they behave in the first 3 hours of gameplay, this game is not for you. If you are looking for a fair game that challenges and rewards players for understanding their opponent and playing their decks efficiently and intelligently then this game is for you. Randomness does play a role in the game, but times when you feel that RNG compeletely decided the outcome of your game are few and far between and in my experience feel much less worse than many of my games in Hearthstone.

Lastly, the game is beautiful, the imps can get annoying but their animations, the board, many of the card effects are absolutely top notch and are a lot of fun. The cards also have voice acted lore tidbits, and the game itself will seem to advance DOTA's lore in expansions through new cards and some really good comics.

 I would strongly recommend this game to experienced ranked Hearthstone and Gwent players or people looking for a good challenging cardgame.
My big review on the pros and cons of this game, with some thoughts and opinions.

[b]Gameplay: [/b]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[u]Pros[/u] - Very fun and tweaks your brain. If you're coming from more traditional games like   backgammon, poker; or other cards games, you might find this an awesome change of pace.

Matchmaking in standard constructed also seems OK. The people saying this game is -EV are talking about tournaments (edit: prize play). If you're a shark in this game playing tournaments for packs with an EV of under a dollar please reevaluate your life.

[u]Cons[/u] - Got a migrane binge playing this.

[b]Cost[/b]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[u] Pros [/u] - I just started playing recently and it looks like cards were way expensive when the game released but a majority have decreased to less than 0.06 cents at the time of writing. If you really want to spend the least amount of money on this game either: 

* Don't buy Axe
* Don't play standard constructed and play one of the f2p modes
* Wait for the game to go hopefully free to play
* "If you want to build a deck": 
      * Buy game. 
      * Play free modes and figure out what kind of deck you want to build. 
      * Lose a lot. 
      * Buy cards off marketplace you want. 
      * You can flesh out a desk for $10-$20 depending on your starting packs.

The reason I never started playing Hearthstone or other deck builders was because you literally have to buy pack after pack for you're 3%  chance drop. The marketplace is god comparitively. 

[u] Cons [/u] -  Its a card game; you have to pay for cards. It seems like everytime a new pack comes out you either have to wait for price to go down or gamble on packs to stay competitive. Valve please don't take advantage of this. 

[b] Final Thoughts [/b]
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This game is awesome and while it may be pay to play, it does it way better than any other card game with the same quality of gameplay. If you like strategical games, or want to give card games a try I would recommmend it; in my opinion its the best card game of its type out there. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]F2P Note to Valve[/b] - Also I hope they are planning to make the game free to play. The whole I have to pay money for this game thing seems unneccesary especially since you can just get packs from playing, people like to gamble, and to be competitive you'll still need to buy cards on the marketplace or trade the ones you get from packs. Without doing any math, the cost of cards is dependent on its supply, so steam sharks will always buy/farm packs to keep the market in equilibrium, and free to play will boost demand if more people start playing.
As a pretty experienced card player myself, i can say, that the core gameplay is exciting and fun. Because everyone is talking about the monetization, i will add my thoughts to it. In my opinion, you can have a great time with the community and playing pauper and spend around 15$ on the game (complete). I'll tell you how. You spend 18$ on the base game. You open your packs (mine were pretty bad). You sell all the cards except commons and basics => get around 7$ (or more) steam credit => buy the whole pauper (only commons) collection (around 4$) and voi lá! You got all pauper decks you will ever play until the next expansion (which you will buy from your 3$ (or more) left). And in my opinion, pauper is even more fun than normal play. You can participate in free Community-driven pauper tournaments, free draft tournaments and much more and have a great time IMO, while if doing good even winning prizes and you can either sell them again (to, idk earn some steam games) or buy some rare cards to get into "normal" Artifact.
When I was young, my brother would bully me everyday after school. I never had anything cool because whenever I got something, my brother stole it or broke it. I always hated my brother since I was young, and I will never forgive him for making me hurt.

and now I can join my own world.
I've been playing since beta, It's a very fun card game that is simple to understand and get better at. I have not been interested or was able to get attached to any card game before Artifact, and its god damn nice to see a Valve game release.
Waited till midnight to play the game for the first time.Only watched a couple of videos to keep the experience of learning the game for myself and it was worth it.Artifact is the type of game that will take hundreds of hours to master and thats really what you are looking for in a card game.While the monitazation is something sketchy its something that all card games have but because of the price tag of the game most people seem to make a huge deal about it.Its someting new and rerfreshing and defenitely not a hurtstone clone.The wait for a valve game has been huge and this release is something i have been waiting on since the day it was announced.So in conclusion artifact is an amazing game that is worth your money and time.
Very fun game and deep gameplay. Every win is enjoyable and every loss leaves you questioning all your decisions and which one you could have done better. Free unlimited draft to learn the game is just the icing on top. Looking forward to seeing this game grow.
Artifact is a very complex game that gives you the excitement as every move counts. And losing only means there is still room for improvement. The latest update proves that valve is really dedicated in making this game succeed
The game is great, and to all the people who are complaining about the monetization module you dont have to pay anything just enjoy the phantom draft it is free and this is all what i want tbh some casual mode that I can play for free. so aslong as this mode exists I will be willing to pay for future expansions.
Very nice Game.

Pros:
- Nice features to play with friends. Private Tournaments, sharing your Deck, ...
- The Ability to inspect the Deck of the opponent after a match.
- You can play Draft for free (you don't keep the Cards)
- There is a draft mode where you keep cards if you wish
- Good Bot-Mode
- No p2w (Don't know where people think that / look at Hearthstone and others -> Here you can directly buy cards)

Cons:
- Bad reviews
Difficult and complex compared to other major card games, but rewarding if you put a little time in. Issues with the economy are overblown, and you can play indefinitely for no extra investment if you wish.
Awesome game. No complaints regarding the pay to play nature of it either. As an MTG player that spends hundreds of bucks on cards everytime a new set come out I don't see the problem in spending some dough on it. If you don't want to spend the money, don't play the game. Simple as.
A very solid TCG game that brings new stuffs to the genre. 5 hours into it and still haven't fully understood the core mechanic, but it's definitely addictive and tempts players into learning and being creative. Strongly recommend to any card game lovers. In terms of micro-transaction, you can purchase packs or specific cards from the community market, just like in CSGO, so it is good enough for me. After all, i never expect to play a TCG without spending a single penny.

One concern I do have with the game is that people haven't figured out the optimal winning strategies yet, which means I have no idea how the ecosystem of the game will look like once a tier list is out.
The opponent has 35 cards.
It's fine, he only has mana to play a few of them.
10 minutes later he finished playing the 34th card.
It's fine, I have 17 creeps on the next lane and I only need 2 to win.
He uses his last card, Condemn all units, so all of my creeps die.
Next round he does 206 damage to my 80hp ancient.
RIP.

10/10 would get rekt again.
So theres 2 aspects, gameplay and monetization. 

Gameplay wise i'd have to give it 9/10 "nothing else comes close". Very deep, butt clenching games all the time. The games are longer than most card games, so feeling you get when winning is the same as dota2, complete ecstasy. Losing is incredibly frustrating as well, the highs comes with the lows, just as in dota2. Don't believe the naysayers that the game is decided on rng, there is alot of rng present, but in the end the better player almost always wins. There's streamers that have 10 perfect runs in a row (50wins). You don't get manascrewed like in magic and just lose, nor do you rely on draws like in HS. You need to focus while playing, making it a pretty bad game for streaming, but amazing to play. So go play instead of watching.

Monetization wise, $20 is the buy-in, but it also gets you 10 packs and 5 tickets worth $25, so the buy-in pays itself. First is draft, personally after playing 2 keeper drafts and 1 phantom draft, i made back 6 packs, 5 tickets, and $40 in steam funds from selling the cards. All you gotta do is get good, and be a little smart with the market. Even if you can't always break even, its gonna take months for the average player to play before needed to buy more tickets. 
Second is constructed, what if you want a good competitive deck? Almost every common and uncommon is listed on the market now for like 0.03-0.10 each. Its incredibly cheap to buy 90% of the cards. Then you complete your deck with the few remaining cards you need. A full deck at this time is something like $30-$40, which you can sell if you want to change decks. I'd say the monetization is not exactly cheap, but its many times cheaper than other AAA popular card games (HS and Magic). Do not compare this with dota2, or tf2, or CSGO in terms on monetization, its a card game and should be compared as such, apples to apples. My score is a 6/10 "not cheap but better than the rest". 
Once again, get good, play it smart, and you'll have a full collection in no time. 

I know people meme alot, but Valve listens. There were already many things changed from beta, like free drafts, market, recycling that the community asked for. Theres already a spectator mode and ingame tournaments, which doesn't exist in other games at launch. They obviously put alot of effort into the client. Features like social aspects, chatting, 1v1 drafts, progression, trading/gifting will without a doubt be implemented in the near future. I mean, it took Hs YEARS to increase deck slots and have a spectator mode, we can't do worst than that. 

Definitely recommend, with an overall 8/10 score, even more when more features come. Bonus points for the polish, theres a TON of voice lines in here, and voiced lore on every card. Great attention to detail.
Heavily recommended!

Great cardgame with a load of fun cards, making room for many different strategies.

Also good to see Valve listening to the community and making frequent update to please the players.

Don't let the "I hate this bcus it's not Hearthstone." sway your decision. 

Definitely worth a try.
Best online card game on the market in my opinion, has so much depth against something akin to hearthstone and makes every win feel rewarding instead of losing a match to diceroll (does happen extremely rarely but is so much more bearable).
Haven't touched constructed at all but the price alone is worth it for the draft which feels like it has so much longevity.
I must say, i am normally not a card game lover, but this one blew my mind. The amount of details is amazing and you can spend up to hours playing this. The only negatives are that its not that new player friendly, when u want to play online you will probably have to battle against someone way better than you, that's a bit frustating because you will probably lose. But after all the game is awesome, definitely worth a buy!
Recommended!
Played Faeria, Yugi-Oh and other card games, this one's pretty fun and if you're a Dota 2 player it's a plus because it's Dota themed, so I'm sure you'll like it,

The negative reviews was because cards cost money in game, but everything is getting cheaper, game is getting updated and a lot of new features are being implemented.. and it's perfectly playable by leveling up and earning cards rather than rushing to buy them..

Chill game you can play it whenever, i usually put music or some podcast on other monitor n play this :P XD

Buy it! also it's a valve game so ez updates and you'll keep playing it forever.
I came to the game with low expectations. I didn't like anything about it, before i played. I thought it was ugly (this red\green board team), imps were annoying. Most of all i disliked the fact, that the game was going to copy MTG card development system, limiting disign space for creating new cards and adjusting the old ones. But i knew i have to try it, and the game turned out to be quite fun to play. I've decided to stick around for some time, and to my surprise, devs made turn to the directon that every digital card game shold follow in my opinion. So, i am gonna keep playing and now i am looking forward for the upcoming changes.
Artifact's combination of Dota lore and unique turn based gameplay makes it an enjoyable experience for those looking for deep tactical turn based strategy.

The financial model has not detracted from the experience as phantom drafts can be executed for free.  The draft mode is truly outstanding as there's so much to consider, and it brings out a very unique, fresh match every time.  

In this game, there's a lot of different decisions to make to affect the hand we're given.  Compared to MTGA or Hearthstone, it has a lot more flexibility with how to interact with the match.  As many have written before, it truly does feel like a turn based version of Dota, which is awesome!  :) 

I highly recommend! :)
Do yourself a favour and buy the game, play it and make an informed decision. I absolutely love this game, I have no doubt that valve will continue to deliver (as they have already in the latest patch) and support this game and the player base. Besides the competitive potential this game is the most fun I have had in years, period.
TL;DR -- I like the game. It's fun. Maybe wait until Valve makes it better with future sets/updates. The recent updates made the game significantly better. I love card games--I have high hopes for the future.

I have been playing TCG and CCG games for quite a while, whether it was Yugioh or Magic (and many others). Or even digital, like HearthStone, Magic Arena, Eternal, etc.
I am not saying that I am the best person at these games--I just genuinely enjoy them.
That being said, Aritfact definitely had a rocky start. However, Valve has shown that they do care about the game and have even changed their stance about balancing cards. Recently, a couple of cards experienced a balance change (some nerfs, some buffs). This is EXCELLENT news because, as any person can imagine, balance is crucial for a game's success.

The gameplay is more complex, but with a little bit of focus, it is easy to understand. There is a high skill ceiling, which is great for any card game (I am not one of those people). The RNG in the game, which may seem bad, does end up being fun to play around. More importantly, the RNG is not 100% factored into your win rate, unlike, for example, some of HearthStone's cards. That is not to say that RNG does not exist--it most certainly does. And, at times, it can even annoy/irritate you. But, usually, it can be played around since you *see* the RNG unfold before the combat actually begins (in other words, you can react to it better).

For those familiar with Hearthstone and Eternal (etc.), Artifact does not let you "dust" (break down / disenchant) excess cards. Getting extra cards requires you to either break them down in-game for tickets, or sell them to other players that want the card. Unless the card is higher rarity, not many may want the card. This market has its ups and downs. The upside is that you can, instead, purchase the card(s) you want DIRECTLY from another player. You wouldn't need to purchase countless packs to "dust" the extras, to then craft the card(s) you want (this could save you lots of money). However, that also comes at a downside, too. There are no daily quests or anything that can help you work towards a full collection for free (if that is something you want). You MUST buy packs from Valve or buy cards from other players if you want to do get better cards (or, in other words: you may have to invest money).
That being said.... recently, Valve added account level to the game. This lets players unlock *free* packs and tickets, per season. So, while it may not be a "daily", there is some progression now. *thumbs up*

Also, it is important to mention that standard play is 100% free. Whether you choose to do competitive or draft, you can no problem. If you want to, you could choose to spend some tickets on the prize mode. If you achieve higher than a 50% winrate, you can walk away with your ticket(s) back, in addition to some free packs. Be careful though!

While I do enjoy the game and, yes, I do recommend it... I have to say that it may be best to wait until Valve continues to add more features to the game, to continue improving it. They are, as of the date of this review, most definitely making the game better. The recent patch proves it. But, I also do believe they have a ways to go, if they want this to be one of the best card games on the market.
I played MTG, Hearthstone and Gwent and I have to say Artifact is by far the most fun card game to play. It's really exciting and every time I lose I feel like there was something I could have done to win.

Definitely recommended
I sincerely recommend this game, especialy if you prefer deep and complex gameplay. Is it pay2win? kinda, but I´d also say that it is highly challenging, if you want to build decks without paying money, you must´nt lose your event tickets.
It costs sum money but its worth it, playerbase is decreasing (no surprise, hyped HS players are going back).

Exciting, stresful, great and sometimes exhausting -> you dont need to do sports      [spoiler] ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) [/spoiler]
Why dont I play more? Because it is so much fun to watch it on twitch (with some knowledge ofc)
This game needs a carrot on a stick and people will love it. It's comparably cheap for a digital card game, when you use the market place. The game doesn't mask RNG  as well as some card games, but that won't bother people who see it in all card games. Targeting a F2P audience with the DotA theme was just dumb. I recomend waiting till one set release, the game really needs more cards.
[h1]Designed by Richard Garfield, creator of [i]Magic the Gathering[/i] — the world's most played trading card game — in collaboration with Valve, [i]Artifact[/i] is a card game unlike any other.[/h1]

The game is a mix of [i]Magic the Gathering[/i] with [i]Dota[/i], but without the most complicated mechanics of them. The basic concept is, you have 3 boards to play your cards on and the objective is to do 40 damage on two of those boards or 120 on one of them. You got creatures and spells to cast — just like [i]MtG[/i] — and also creeps that spawn automatically, gold to buy items and hero characters — just like [i]Dota[/i]. It looks complicated to play something like this on three boards at the same time but it's surprisingly easy to keep track of what's going on. The first tutorial is excellent and will give you the rules intuitively.

Gameplay apart, [i]Artifact[/i] is a really good game for its $20 price tag. You get 2 complete starter decks, 10 booster packs, 5 event tickets (more on that later) and also a month subscription of Dota Plus if you are a Dota 2 player. From the start, [b]you can play an unlimited amount of any of the casual modes without spending any extra money[/b] because you can play decks with cards you don't own. To play competitive modes, on the other side, you need to use event tickets that you acquire by buying directly from the store or by winning competitive matches. And the Constructed mode (where you play with your own cards) you need to get some good cards first, like any other TCG. But the "problem" starts here...

There's no way to obtain cards by grinding (you can obtain by winning competitive mode but, remember, this mode require event tickets...) so if you want to play competitively you need to buy/trade cards almost exclusively. That of course means the system privileges those who got bigger wallets, but that's not different from other card games. The thing is, by not being physical, you are obligated to use a mediator that takes a cut for every transaction (Steam Market), and you are locked to Steam Wallet funds, so you can only spend the money inside the Steam environment.

Because of this, [i]Artifact[/i] is being heavily criticized and that's reasonable. But that's it. The game is extremely fun and, again, you can play casual modes without spending a single extra dime. Also if you don't have any intent to play competitively, you can even sell your cards to get some money back and still continue playing (in casual mode you don't need to use any of your cards).

So, concluding, it's really hard to be Valve right now. Their great games of the past still haunts them and the recent cash-grabbing trends of the industry makes the gaming community harsher than it ever was. But the fact is: even though it's not for everyone, [i]Artifact[/i] is the most recent clear example that Valve still knows how to make good and interesting games.
Awesome game. Gameplay is addicting/fun. They do need to add some features to the game, as well as expansions to add more diversity, but the base of this game is extremely promising. I see alot of reviews saying the best card is a credit card yada yada yada, well you get 5 tickets with the game plus 10 card pack, and i was able to make a profit just from those ten packs. Intergration of the steam market is awesome, you can buy the cards you want for a small price..minus a few top tier cards. This game is less of a grind then HS, and you know what you are getting with buying cards off the market, compare that to HS where you gotta grind and hope for good cards. I will take the artifact system all day long
There seems to be a lot of confusions about the payment model of Artifact, so I'd like the cover that.

Many of the negative reviews here seem come from people who only ever play F2P games and have also never played any sort of CCG.  All major CCGs require you to buy cards in order to create any sort of competitive deck.  I know that other games have ways of grinding for cards without paying anything, but the time required to actually have a full collection of cards, or even a top tier competitive deck is absolutely insane.  With the existence of the marketplace, I'm fairly confident that Artifact is actually the cheapest popular CCG you can invest in.  Also, many people (including myself) actually made MORE than $20 back from the market place after opening my initial 10 packs.  I literally made a profit from buying Artifact...

That being said, if you're trying to play constructed when you first start playing artifact, you're making a mistake imo.  Practice playing draft in casual mode.  Once you have a decent understanding of how the game works and start going 3/5 wins consistently, start spending your tickets to play competitive draft.  This is how you should be grinding for cardpacks to eventually play constructed with.

As a side note, constructed is probably the least interesting mode to play currently.  As with most new CCGs, the card pool isn't super huge at the moment so decks in constructed don't seem that interesting to me (and many of the pro players in the scene share the same thought).  Draft mode is incredibly fun to play and I suggest you cut your teeth in the game starting there.
This is my new favourite TCG. The number of meaningful decisions made per match is incredible, the gameplay is quick, fun, and complex, and the artwork and overall aesthetics are beautiful.

Draft and constructed are both great, though I find myself playing almost exclusively draft. I think the principle reason for this is the small card set that exists right now. There is not much variety for deckbuilding right now and the constructed meta involves very few matchups. However, variation within matchups is huge compared to other TCGs, mitigating this noticeably. Playing with Core Set 2019 only in MTG would be nowhere near as much fun. The future of constructed is bright, and draft itself is enough of a blast to justify playing anyway.

I am finding success in expert mode, but if I weren't and couldn't justify risking the tickets, I'd still be happy with casual play. The no-risk phantom drafts are endless fun, and people don't seem to be abandoning and re-drafting for perfect decks as some suggested they would. For the price tag, the amount of high-quality gameplay without spending another penny is already way more than enough, and the cost to keep playing in expert is pretty low if you're close to 50% winrate.

As for the overall economy, I really disagree with the popular view that it's a big problem. People have said over and over that it's far better than other TCGs, but I don't think that's constructive at this point. To convince you that the economy is nice here compared to a free-to-play game, I'll point out how cheap it is to "rent" decks. If you don't mind the money staying within your steam account, you can buy all the components of a deck, play around with it for a few days, and just sell the components again for relatively little cost. In Hearthstone or especially MTGA, once you get a deck you're stuck with it, and lose either 75% or 100% of the value if you don't like it. I always hear people asking on HS "is this a smart craft?" etc, but in Artifact that's just not an important question. You get to play however you want, whichever decks you want, and the investments are minimal.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend buying the game and trying a few phantom drafts without claiming your packs. Valve will give you a refund if you don't like it, and if you do, then the $20 pricetag is probably worth just that aspect, and you can decide what to do with the packs/tickets in the future, if anything.
Bought this for a joke and to get dem free cards so i can get some money, but gaben weave another fate for me.

[h1] BOY ISN'T THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE. [/h1]
Said a guy with zero experience in card game, not even knowing what the F is card game in the first place. The gameplay is fun and your brain need to work hard to win. RNG is crazy, but tactics still extremely required.

[h1] Microtransaction [/h1]
Whining people talking about how microtransaction ruined this game. There's this mode called draft where you draft your deck (which open up like 5 pack and construct it before a match), you'll play this deck until either you lose twice, or get 5 consecutive win. no need to spend any money. The microtransaction made for people who love to collect card or wanted to feel the satisfaction of winning with your own well-constructed deck.

[strike]Although the gameplay is fun, and is playable by just paying the base price (competitively), I can't recommend if you want multiplayer game. There's nothing in this game that make the community alive or even to make you feel like playing a multiplayer game. No chat between the player (nor emote), no statistic, no profile. It's just felt dead.[/strike] (Already implemented) 

Stunning graphic, beautiful and passionate soundtrack, nice effect, and decent voice acting. Don't doubt this game in this part. It's a masterpiece.

12/30/2018 edit

The multiplayer aspect were added and they decided to do a constant nerf/buff once in a while. With this, if the community stay alive, I do recommend this game
People are too harsh on this game. You have ulimited fun and free activities and you get your money back in packs and special event tickets. Well worth picking up if you like digital trading card games.

One complaint. The game does not have direct trade or even gifting at the time of this post. If it gets this, it is without question worth it.
I've been having a blast playing Artifact. The thing is you have to get better in the game ASAP otherwise you won't complete the cards, unless you can pay for them. Anyway I'm having fun in casual draft until i feel i'm good enough to adventure myself into expert draft. I reccomend buying this game to people that are willing to commit time to it and improve at the game or spend money in the case scenario they are not good enough.
Seeing as there don't seem to be many reviews from people who have actually played a decent amount of the game I'll paste my comment I wrote for somewhere else:


I think the gameplay is phenomenal and is the most enjoyable and in depth in any digital card game I've played (I've played 1,000 hours of Hearthstone and nearly 500 hours of Gwent).

80% of the matches are incredibly close, often coming down to the final round having potential lethal for both players. This makes the games very exciting, I've never had a card game cause my heart rate to increase before. RNG is the main gameplay related issue that I see people complain about due to many things from deployment, attack directions and shopping being dictated by dice rolls. However I think the main reason people have an issue with this is that RNG has a much more visible impact on the game than most other decisions. You can clearly see if you lost lethal due to an attack arrow going in the wrong direction, but all of the decisions that led up to that point are invisible due to there being so many possible plays to make each round. You may have 'lost' the game due to that coinflip, but if you ended up in a position where that lost you the game, you probably made a misplay in an earlier round. It is also much harder than most card games to tell if you made the right play. If you invest more into one lane and kill an enemy hero, it generates you gold advantage and board control, but then a few rounds down the line that hero re-deploys into a different lane and you lose because he was able to change lanes and snowball from there. Was killing that hero the right decision? Maybe, but you can't necessarily tell, whereas you can instantly tell if RNG was bad or good. 

Overall I think the RNG in Artifact is generally fine, aside from cards like Cheating Death and Bounty Hunter which I hope are reworked. 

The main talking point of the game seems to be the monetisation, which is understandable. I personally disagree with Valves decision to use the TCG model for Artifact and despite highly enjoying the game I will not defend the cost of top tier constructed decks. However I think draft is by far the best gamemode at the moment so the monetisation choices don't effect me. You can play draft entirely for free for no rewards (but Valve have stated progression is their priority right now) and I'm also fine with spending $5 a month (or probably less) on tickets for expert draft as most of my runs give me my ticket back and you can sell the packs you win for multiple tickets on the market. Another note is that I've found no difference between the quality of opponents or deck strength in the free vs paid draft mode so you won't be missing out by not buying tickets. 

One final thing is that the built in tournament feature is very enjoyable and I've played in a few tournaments from Artifinder.com or the Artifact discord channel. 

While I disagree with the monetisation for constructed but would highly recommend the game for anyone interested. You will get your moneys worth just playing draft and I'm excited for future features and updates, as a former Dota 2 player I know Valve will support this game well and it has such an excellent base to build upon.
It's a little tiresome reading reviews that are ultra-focused on how the game isn't free to play as a negative, while completely overlooking the ways in which it is actually a positive. The saddest thing about these reviews is they completely ignore game mechanics in favor of whinging about monetization, because Artifact is certainly the most interesting digital CCG I've encountered from a gameplay perspective. 

First, let's get it out of the way: the price. As a longtime player of Magic: the Gathering and its venerable online version, the concept of digital objects that cost real money and can be sold to other players is not a foreign one to me. I look at the pricing of Artifact as a totally reasonable take on the digital CCG in light of the fact that you are *easily* able to sell cards you don't need or want on the Steam marketplace with almost zero effort on your part. Will you make a profit cracking packs? No, you won't - but you absolutely can research, build, and play a competitive deck for very little cash up front by buying what you need from others. For many working adults, near-infinite entertainment value out of $30 or $40 is a bargain, and that's especially true here since the actual game is pretty excellent.

Event tickets, again, are not a strange concept to veterans of MTGO - or even paper Magic (or whatever other CCG/LCG/TCG) tournaments at a friendly local game store. Almost any tournament that offers prizes has an entry fee. And with Artifact, since the game pieces can be bought and sold, it's important that Valve doesn't pump the economy full of freely-obtained cards. Implementing the standard f2p daily/weekly quest mechanics for "free" cards would undermine what appears to be a design goal for the game: the creation of a secondary market. 

Of course, it's also worth pointing out that there absolutely ARE free-to-play modes in Artifact; those modes do not provide you with card or ticket rewards, though. Think of them as opportunities to play with cards you don't yet own - kind of a "try before you buy".

I agree that all of the aforementioned details should be made more clear to people considering purchasing Artifact - you're really not buying a full game, you're buying a starter deck bundled with some event tickets. 

So with all of that out of the way, let's look at the actual game!

Artifact is a strange brew. Honestly, I struggle to come up with a metaphor that easily captures its essence. Like Magic, you cast spells and summon creatures to defeat your opponent. There's a resource system like Hearthstone or Duelyst, where the number of resources you have to play cards increases each turn automatically. Units attack and block, much like other CCGs. 

But there's also a secondary resource system to contend with - you earn gold for destroying your opponent's units. Gold can buy you cards selected at random each turn from a secondary deck (like DOTA's shops), or consumable items, or a randomly chosen item that's not even in your deck (which can lead to some strange outcomes, for sure). There's also a less-random version of Magic's colors here, in that you can only play cards of a given color if you have a hero in play that matches them. Oh, and, you're managing all of these systems across three distinct (but connected) boards.

Each game of Artifact has a staggering number of choices to make. Do you go for early kills and farm up gold to buy powerful items? Do you focus all your resources in overloading one lane and try to stalemate the other two? Not only do you need to make these choices as games play out, but your deck has to be constructed with these issues among others in mind if you hope to win. If you're playing the game's (excellent) draft mode, you also need to select cards from random packs to assemble something like a playable deck, which is a challenge unto itself before the game itself even starts.

To sum up, I've been playing competitive card games for over 20 years now. At the moment, Artifact is in my mind the third best of all time, behind only Magic: the Gathering, and the now-defunct VS System. Valve has an opportunity here to reinvent the digital CCG, and I am excited to see where they take it.
From what ive played so far, a very well designed game, i wouldn't listen to all these reviews saying its pay to win.
My deck cost $10
I've beaten every expensive meta deck I've versed execpt one.
I even beat a deck worth $100+ in one of my games, most people compaining about pay to win just suck at the game and expected to be good right off the start. 
Well done valve on making an interesting alternative to other card games and for all the time spent on this game, its not pay to win, but its also not unreasonable for valve to expect money from you after all the effort and time that went into the making of this game.
Artifact is the kind of card game I’ve been waiting for a long time. It features both a solid amount of strategic game play as well as being an overall good visual product. To me this sets it much above most of the competition. I’ve already had so many close games where myself and my opponent are trying to outfox each other to gain that critical upper hand to win the match. I can’t say I’ve felt that way with any other card game. 

Not only is the typical constructed deck game play, but there’s also draft mode, which you don’t see in all card games. This is probably the golden gem right now as you can play draft for free. If you ask me that’s worth the $20 price of admission straight up. Games are much more fun and interesting when you aren’t playing the same meta decks repeatedly. It also adds even more skill to drafting and constructing decks on the fly which I find really rewarding.

There’re a few cards with a bit too much RNG (like cheating death) but overall RNG feels rather limited in the overall design which is a good thing. I won’t say you won’t ever get screwed by it, it does happen, but it tends to be the exception rather than the rule.

Most of the time I feel like when I lose a match I could’ve played differently or made better strategic decisions that could have led to a victory. I think that is really in contrast to Hearthstone or MTG where if you don’t draw on curve and your opponent does it feels like you stand a very small chance of winning. 

This game has a lot of controversy around it, part of it is probably deserved, but I think in the big picture most of it is unwarted. 

The game is not very budget player friendly. You can’t pick it up for free and grind out free cards like Hearthstone, MTG or Gwent. To be fair even though other card games allow you to grind cards, Gwent is the only one that’s even remotely generous in terms of what you get. I don’t think it’s fun to grind months on end to build a higher tier deck. If you want to play competitive constructed in any of those games, you’ll likely end up buying cards to move along much faster. Artifact is no different, and you could argue it’s better in some ways as there’s a marketplace where you can just buy the cards you need to craft a competitive deck rather than opening packs. Over time as the market becomes saturated, I would think it will cost less than the alternatives. I’d personally rather have this system.

The game does have a few other warts. No replays are a bit of a bummer considering other Valve games have them. There’s a tournament mode, but you have the part of groups or have friends to run them, you can’t just host open lobbies like some games. There is no real “ranked” or ladder mode like you would be used to in DOTA or similar. I personally don’t think these are as much of an issue as it seems. I look at something like DOTA and have watched it grow over the years. I think in due time these things will be added and its early days so far. Valve has really supported and help their games grow, and they seem poised to do it here as well. It has more features than some of the competition whom have been out much longer.

If you compare the cost of Artifact to what it would cost to play Hearthstone or MTG competitively Artifact seems to win handily, but it’s early. I think overall Artifact is the best competitive game. If you compare which game is better for the budget player Gwent is the clear winner. If you want the most casual game, I would say Hearthstone is your best bet.

Overall, I think the game is great for a first version and it’s a lot of fun. There’s room for improvement, and it doesn’t tick all the boxes for everyone which is causing very mixed reviews. In the grand scheme of things, I think it’s a pretty competitive product that will only get better with time. If you enjoy a more complex card game, then I think it’s the best one on the market. $20 is worth it for the free draft mode alone, but if that doesn’t interest you and you’re a budget player you should look elsewhere.

This is my second card game after Yu Gi Oh. Its an amazing card game, the cards are OP but just like Dota 2, there's always counters for ANYTHING. I don't have any idea about card game but this game describe everything well. Every info is easily seen on screen, The card description very easy to understand for someone who new to card game like me. Well polished a lot attention of details especially for some crucial info part. Drafting mode worked very very well if you don't want pay to win game, and there's a play to win mode 'Keeper Draft' which is very fine to me.
BUT, still lack of some crucial feature like Chat/emote, Match recap, Rank/level system, etc... I know they will add it soon but that feature must be in the game at release.

Overall this is a good game, I played a lot at the first day of buying this game and no waiting time between matchmaking is insanely tiring.
- Bought the game for 17,95€
- Installed game
- Steamrolled the tutorial, opened all the packs
- Playing online vs rich kids with 40€+ decks makes me feel seriously bullied
- Sold some good cards for 18.20€, making 0.25$ profit
- Uninstalled game
Coming from playing cardgames like MtG, I can appreciate the direction that this new cardgame is taking. You can definitely feel the inspiration of MtG in this game, but it has an interesting twist on the mana system: Heroes determine what sort of attribute cards can be played per lane while your towers increase your maximum mana by 1 per turn (There are cards that can modify this aspect). I didn't think the three lane system would be simple/easy to understand at first, but once you play through the tutorial levels (or watch a few rounds online), you'll quickly begin to appreciate how this system allows for more widespread gameplay and tactics based on personal preference. 

Pros:
- Intuitive laning system allows for more strategy/deck possibilities
- Market place allows for individual card trading/purchasing
- Integrated marketplace system for selling/buying cards Also allows for people to purchase individuals instead of chancing it on $2 boosters
- Card art/voice acting is top notch
- 10 packs/starter deck given to you on purchase.

Cons:
- No profile system in game yet.
- No replays in game yet.
- Selling cards should have their own Artifact currency, as exchange rates tend to chunk off profits for those selling rare cards. (debatable) 
- Tutorial levels leave more to be desired. 
- No in game chat system/communication during matches with opponent. (Might be a blessing in disguise)


I'm hoping for some of the cons I listed to be addressed in the future, but overall, Artifact is a very solid game for what was brought to the table. I can only see this game getting better as time progresses.
This may be my favorite card game I've ever played. I have a heavy background in both physical (YuGiOh, Magic, Game of Thrones LCG, Keyforge) and digital (Hearthstone, Duelyst, Slay the Spire) card games, and while it may not be the strictly most mechanically complex card game I've played, it is certainly the most mentally complex and strategic. Every game, it feels like a win was earned by good play, or a loss was due to poor play. There is minimal randomness to the game compared to other digital card games like Hearthstone. Besides a few random damage and discard effects (mostly in Blue and Black), almost everything is non-random.

I can see how there may be some concerns that the game is P2W, but the initial $20 purchase is a great jumpstart to the game. I'd recommend playing with the preconstructed Call to Arms decks for a bit before moving onto casual phantom drafts. These let you learn the cards and also the drafting mode, which is my favorite. Once you get the hang of it, you can start doing expert drafts to try to get packs, or doing keeper drafts with the 10 packs you received, or others bought (I would be careful not to jump into keeper drafts right away, though - wait until you've won a couple 5-win gauntlets or phantom drafts).

I do wish the game had ways to talk to or interact with your opponent in chat, and the tournament and find-a-friend features don't seem to be fully functional (unless they're only meant for LAN situations), but overall it's an amazing game.

Performance: 10/10 - runs like a charm
Audio/Visual: 8/10 - the game's audio and visuals are above average
Artstyle: 6/10 - this is one spot where the game could be better - it doesn't have the charm of a game like Hearthstone or Slay the Spire, but it is not a detriment to the game - just not something that draws you in as easily
Design: 10/10 - this is where the game really shines. The overall design and balance seems excellent

Overall: 9/10 - it's pretty much exactly what I've been looking for. A mentally stimulating, well-balanced, popular card digital card game.
Artifact is a really fun and challenging game.  The people that are upset about the economy seem to be new to CCGs.  The PCGamer article about the economy really is correct.  The normal PC people are upset, veterans CCG players are used to it.  With the market, you can actually buy the deck you want for a good price, especially comparible to other CCGs.
So this game is really really fun if your into deeper thinking strategy. Even though it isn't free it really isn't that expensive to play and getting individual packs is pretty cheap on top of that most cards are cheap to buy as singles with only a select ammount of cards being moderately expensive at the time of writing. (Axe is like 20 bucks, who happens to be the most expensive card). I've had other friends try the game out too and they all agree that the game play is excellent. However it does have it's drawbacks at the moment. 

Obviusly the competitive modes require tickets to play however there is casual versions of those same modes so it really doesn't hurt that badly. There is no ranked ladder yet and no way to tell ur mmr, match history etc etc. however its been said that around december 14 some new content will come out. 

Another annoying thing is that while the custom tournament mode is very VERY FLEXIBLE in doing things how you like it, it requires a mininum or 4 players instead of a mininum of 3 players to do a round robin. There seems to be some optimization issues for slower PC's which knowing valve will get fixed at some point. 

The market it self is not bad though, as previously mentioned most stuff are cheap and it does have the option to only search for stuff that is unowned so you can buy the whole collection if your someone who likes to collect, it also lets you search for cards you have in excess and you can just sell it in bulk. One of my friends who only had the base game with the 10 packs made like 15 bucks or something off sell option and got stuff for other games using that money. 

As for the meta state, there is a few problem cards that are locked behind the rarity, as mentioned before AXE is the most expensive due to how strong his stats are and his card, and drow ranger are two that come to mind, she has too strong of an effect with too strong of a spell card. Also since release day it seems that allot of people have been spamming red black decks due to how aggressive that colour combo is in the early turns which nets a gold lead. Thus it seems that if you wana try hard you got to run red green or red black. At least for now of course you don't have to meta slave but these are things to be aware of.

Despite this most matches I've played have felt close, occasionally some games are too stompy but u can tell early on to be honest. The big thing to really understanding this game is that its basically a TCG you play online it isn't a CCG view it as playing magic or yugioh or final fantasy not as another hearthstone. Its far cheaper to get a full collection if thats what you want compared to the ccgs.
Update: with the latest patch , Valve has added progression. balancing also is done, valve acted fast to the criticism and now the game is nearly perfect with tons of possibilities. high recommanded.


Those who commented this game is p2w/p2p, you expect the whole collection to be free with just 20 USD?
I came from Hearthstone and Hearthstone require more money to have the full collection and you cant even sell your cards if you want to quit.
If you compare with all the TCG/CCG, Artifact is indeed the cheapest with the most interesing mechanics and gameplay.
I see great potential in this game, there will be denitely more updates/feature in the future.
The pay to play system is defintely obsurd, but if you look past that the game is extremely good and it's easily worth the money. This is the most polished release of a game I have seen in years. That being said, I really hope they release some free way for you to get cards, even if you have to play 100 games for one card, or a tournament where you can win some of your opponent's cards(like at real tournaments). A proper in game trading system should also be implemented.
I really don't understand the complaints about monitization in this game. Yes it is very difficult to add cards to your collection without spending money (you must win 3 games in arena to gain a new ticket I beleive). But this is nothing new to games of this genre. Yes, a game like Hearthstone allows you to easily gain gold for new packs, but you have no choice over what card you want. In Artifact if you want a specific card you can get it on the steam market for usually under $0.5. And, these cards have real value, so if you're done with a deck, you can sell it back on the market to finance a new one. Also, there is a free gauntlet mode (arena for Heathstone players). The game is fun and the cost to build a constructed deck is not unreasonable.
Very well designed and made. I don't really like card games and this is the first card game I tried, but it looks so good. Details and features are also very deep. Only bad thing about the game is that there is no Pudge.
This game is simply great. Probably the best and most fun TCG I have ever played.

I played 25hours now and every match is so exciting and close in the end, it's awesome!

Worth every cent! And by the way, it is the cheapest TCG I have ever played. In YuGiOh for example, a good competitive deck is 100€+, here you can get very good decks for about 10€
1. "Okay I think my set is pretty well built. I'm ready!" 
2. Start a game
3. Defeated
4. "Oh no, is my set actually not well built enough?!?!?!?!"
5. Looking up other cards and sets
6. Add funds to steam wallet
7. "Okay I think my set is pretty well built. I'm ready!" 
......
*LOOP*

Oh it's still quite fun to play tho.
Too all the people complaining about not being able to unlock more cards without spending additional money: If you open your starter packs, sell some or all of the cards you get (thats 228 in total - 2x pre-constructed decks and 10x boosters), just buy the cheapest ones (0,04,-) on the community market and then convert them to tickets (10->1), you'll have enough of them to build a collection. 

Just 5 bucks worth of cards you sell nets you 12 tickets if you convert the cheapest cards right now. how many boosters you make out of that depends on how well you do in draft, but you can practice draft for free.

If the initial 17 bucks are too much for you, go play one of the f2p alternatives. god forbid a developer charges money for a well made game.
Quality & Polish: Definitely Valve
Cards: Fun, and with the latest update you can just get the packs for free. Though some of them are still nerve-ANNIHILATING.
Design: Seems confusing but very fun, difficulty somewhere in the middle of Heartstone and Gwent
Conclusion: Good game from Valve after a 5 year long hiatus, albeit the entrance price is kinda high.
Gameplay is great, card prices are down and Valve has changed it's previous decision to not buff/nerf cards. It's still lacking a chat/lobby, replay, proper ranking and rewards systems, but right now it's already worth buying. If you like card/puzzle games, this is one of the best, and I hope it becomes great (sooner than later), because it sure does have potential.
First of all, you can play this game even without spending more than the cost for the base game.
And even if you want every card, it is by far cheaper, than for example hearthstone, to collect all of them. 

Its hard game with a high skill cap. But makes a lot of fun. 

And knowing how fast Valve fixes stuff, I´m really looking forward. It IS the BEST virtual card game on the market right now. By far.
This game is not free to play, but there in lays a possitive difference to all other TCG out there. Here, when you score a card worth major bucks, you can actually use it to purchase other steam games, which wouldn't work if you could grind to find a free expensive card.

Money aside, this game's tactical and skill level is something to praise, as you've to put thought into your moves, that benefit the war and not just the battle that is but one of three lanes. The lore is something worth investing into and if you're already a Dota fan (unlike me) you're going to find more meat to the meal you've already been feasting on for years.

If I could make a few suggestions to see the game improved:

1. I introduc intro and starter and standard editions to the game. Where starter is only the tutorials of the game, plus 1 bot match with a temp deck. Starter edition would be the game, with fewer booster packs and standard would be the game version that's currently on the market.

2. Add some shiny or animated versions of the cards with a slight value increase.

3. Adding a replay saving feature, where you can look back on what tactics were used for your defeat or victory.


Other than that, I think this is a great addition to the TCG genre.

PS
The free draft modes are a blessing to any person who played with physical cards with their friends.

Divisive, and not for everyone! Watch some videos on it, and see the gameplay to determine if it is for you! :)

TL;DR;
Personally, the monetization doesn't hinder the game experience for me, and the card game itself has a really nice board game feel to it, and I can't wait to see them build around this system. 

For more Info:
Monetization: 5/10 - Better than other models of it's type; however, it is debatable whether this type of monetization is inherently good or bad. The pros are that it allows for some type of valued market, and this is enforced by how easy it is to turn cards into another game if you so choose.

Gameplay: 10/10 - This game has a great deal of promise. It has the complexity of more complicated board games, while allowing for easy interaction with the game state. Information about the current state is easy to digest, and intuitively accessible. The cards are fairly simple with their interactions in the first set; however, the systems are new, shiny, and complex so I believe this was intential. In future sets I hope they go ham with the possible interactions that are available to them. One of the greatest aspects of this card game ( and why I akin it more to a board game above ), is that there is a large feeling of agency in this card game compared to others. Many times, in a card game it feels like there are 2-3 choices, with mostly 1 correct answer, sometimes 2. In Artifact I feel like at any given time there are a dozen or so choices, with many of them having their own pros and cons. While at a really high level, there may be a "more" correct choice, it definitely gives a great deal of satisfaction in wins. It feels like you caused the win, and win you lose, it feels like you had so many other choices that were good to you that you want to try out next time. 

Audio/UX/Quality/etc: 9/10 - Wow! The sound design, voice work, and art assets are amazing.... But screw talking about all of that, have you looked at the imps... I would almost buy this game specifically to examine their animations and reactions. I absolutely love that they are in this game, and they very subtely add some meaning to each individual match with their animations. They really add character to this game. Bring forth the Plushies valve...

Card Design: 7/10 - Garfield knows his stuff, this is a SUPER solid set 1; however, the systems make me want more. As of writing this in set 1, I think they played it a little too safe; however, this is understandable. In the future, if they really expand their interactions I believe this will be a higher rating.

UX: 6/10 - Certain aspects are really nice; however, I feel some easy improvements are needed to really bring the UX where it needs to be.
1. Colorblind mode
2. Scrollable cards with more font/fontsize choices
3. Prediction - If I go to cast a card like Time of Triumph or nevermore, I want to see what the new damage values would be  etc

( This one is a little more debatable, but the guard on the towers I feel should be oriented to the North position instead of the South position )

Hands down the best Card Game i have played so far. Not for Casuals.
Versatile and complex ! 

This is a TCG and the buisness Model is absolutly fine.
You buy the Game for 18.75 € and you get about 25 € Value out of it. 5 Tickets, 10 Card Packs and 2 Basic Decks. If you are a little lucky Kobold, you can even get way more out of it. But yes, questionable Argument because it's luck dependant. Anyway, you get more than you pay for.

After purchasing the Game you can start to play and learn Draft Mode to get a good feel playing the Game, understand its Mechanics and learn the Cards. 
Constructed i wouldn't advise to play until you have a good Deck to play with, which you need Cards for.
How to get Cards w/o paying a lot Money ? Draft ! Draft ! Draft ! 3 Wins in Phantom Draft and you get your Ticket back, 4 Wins and you have a Ticket and a Pack, 5 Wins 1 Ticket and 2 Packs. And you do not pay a single Dolla Dolla, because you have 5 Tickets to start with.
''All you need'' is PRACTISE !

It is a hard Game, it will require a lot of practise and Training, but you don't necessarily have to spend a lot of Money.
Stop hating because you don't get everything for FREE little Kids. . .
Don't play with ticket mode first. 
Use casual or bot games until you will understand how the game works.
I lose my first 5 games in a row before I win.
So far I enjoyed playing the game. 
I only bought none rare ones but still I love the RNG and rekt my opponent.

Gameplay is varied and fun. There aren't "non-games" like in MTG where sometimes one player is starved or flooded with land. The matches usually are quite close. RNG is there but not as game deciding as we're used to in card games.
I'm missing stats about my matches, a profile of some sorts, to keep track of my games and performance over time. Social features are also incomplete. I am confident features like these will be added over time, but maybe the release was a bit too soon :D.
I like the monetization model, it's the right balance between enabling varied gaming for free while also keeping the collecting appeal. You'll get more out of your money than say Eternal, Hearthstone, which lack free drafting and have the more expensive constructed format if you wanna be competitive.

All in all a good game that's a lot of fun to play but still lacks some sort of personal stats and social online interactions.
This is what Magic Online should have been.

A good card game that builds upon the great infrastructure of Steam Marketplace, and didn't compromise integrity for accesibility. It won't please everybody, you either love it or hate it.

Regarding the initial purchase, you get a lot from it in terms of in game content, and the main reason it is there is to prevent people making multiple accounts that could lead to market manipulation or botting. It is not that unlikely that we will see a free demo in the future that has certain limits set.

Right now you can feel the lack of cards with only a set being released, but the game is deep enough that every decision you take has an impact, and games that are out of your control are rare.
Fun and deep game. A lot of the criticism about 'pay to win' is not really appropriate, you can play forever for free in phantom draft and casual modes.
For someone who does not have a lot of time on hand to earn the so called 'free packs' in other games, artifact has a very fair monetization system. I can buy individual cards and trade with friends, even borrow their deck. There are only three rarities, and a card of the highest rarity is guaranteed to be in every pack, which avoides making single cards to be super hard to get (or super expensive in the marketplace).
Last but not least, it is just a super fun and challenging game.
Nest monetization system in the market. You can literally get a t1 deck for like 30$. There are only a few expensive cards, and they aren't even very expensive; axe may cost 30$ which isn't cheap, but you only ever need one copy of it. The same goes for drow ranger. Compare that to any other card game where you may need 3 copies of several cards that cost that amount and you will soon see that Artifact is insanely cheap.

There shound (and will) be some kind of ladder you can climb in 'ranked', but as far as I have heard they are working on implementing that.

Personally, I have almost no complaints with this game. I think it is a fantastic card game, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes deep strategic thinking.
So this card game has been refreshing for me. There is a lot of talk about how much it costs to play - Personally I am of the mind set that i'd rather just buy the cards I want instead of grinding out packs of cards for random drops/buying packs. Think I spent 15 euroes to buy all the cheap cards/heroes, and dont feel the need to buy axe/drow - since the game is based on three lanes, you just need to concentrate on winning two of them and hindering the third if possible. 

I'm finding very little randomness in this game which is great for me, I always hated that in hearthstone. 
(Honestly I wish I could just sell all my HS cards off or something, spent way to much on that game with the expansions.)

The possiblilty to play draft mode is there for free, which means getting to use any card possible without owning it - I would like them to add a ticket/pack at 4/5 consecutive wins in the free mode, I think that would help the playerbase a lot.

Overall a great TCG imo. I think people will learn to play around the meta heroes somewhat, I mean if one hero is OP they can't be in all three lanes at the same time :) Time will tell .. and for now im having fun with it :)
First card game i feel is based mostly on skill and relies very little on rng. Regarding the economy if you dont want to put money into it you will have access to infinite free drafts and to win prizes you can go infinite quite easily. The imps are also very fun :D
For the price of admission:

A really really interesting take on the genre, with the 3 lanes and the Hero items providing loads of variety and strategy.

Unlimited free draft in casual play mode, every card available.

Your collection or pre-made deck vs others or bots in casual.

Your collection in ranked (requires tickets you can get from winning).

Now if I completely ignore the last bit, the rest of it is still a massive massive load of stuff if you arent a competitive player. Will be effortless to get 50 hours from this without buying a single extra card.
So far i am very pleased with how Artifact has played out. Both Fun and Money wise.
Tbh, i am a total noob at trading card games. So i wont write anything about how well balanced the game might be, you need to read that information in a different Review.
But for now i am having great fun playing the Pre-Constructed Event Decks. And seeing that a new Event is already coming mid next month it looks like they regularly switch things up. If this means i always have new Pre-Constructed Decks to play with i am happy with spending no money (except for the initial 20) at all on the game.
I also had some really fun matches against friends, borrowing some of their self made Decks. I can imagine if i join some Artifact Discord/Steamgroup/Community i would always have someone to play against. This really reminds me of the social feel of a REAL TCG. 

As for the monetization, i don´t really get what the fuss is all about. For me, there is enough fun in this game (With Pre-Constructed, Social Deck borrowing, Phanton Drafts, Changing Events) even without owning a collection. And eventually i will get good, learn about all possible/viable combinations and maybe spend another 20 bucks to buy me my own Deck, Assuming that until then, market prices will have stabilized this Deck will have only cost me ~1€ (5% Steam Transaction fee) if i ever decide to drop artifact and sell my deck. (And someone on Steam releases a new game i can spend those 19€ Steam Wallet on... I know very unlikely on this Platform....)

And for the 20 you need to pay in the beginning. I can only talk for myself, but i could sell all of my cards and would get (at the time of writing) ~16 back. Of course this very much depends on how much luck you have opening the packs (i´ve opened them all).

Btw. building Decks with a limitied collection is fun as well.
Being able to pay straight up for a competitve constructed deck, without endless grinding, is amazing. In this regard Artifact is way ahead of the game when compared to MTG:A. Being able to sell cards also gives you a lot more flexibility. Money dumped into MTG:A is a complete loss, especially once rotation hits. With Artifact you can at least sell cards you don't need for Steam bucks (not as great as cash but way better than the complete loss you get in other games). 

Artifact definitely needs rewards for casual modes, and some kind of progression system, but the core of the game is solid.
Brilliantly designed TCG, so engaging and extremely fun. Not being able to grind for cards for me personally is liberating. I don't have to do daily quotas in order to keep up with other people or pay a crap ton of money to hopefully get the card I want. Here I bought Luna a hero card for 90 cents. And i was able to play with her right away. The monetization in this game is perfect for me.

HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend
really good and strategic card game. finally some game which does not end with teh card draw. It comes with cool modes where you can play decks with cards you do not own. 

The goal of this game is clearly to have fun and experience the game instead of pushing you through a very long grind for a few cards. Yes you have to pay for every card/packs/tickets BUT in other card games you have to normally as well if you want to enjoy these games (like magic, hearthstone etc.)
Their free to play model seems free and to a certain amount it is but unless you spent years of grinding you wont have the good cards to play in ladder.

I only played a few days and watched streamers...so my opinion might change but at the moment this game is something i was looking for. I am a huge fan of card games and played mostly every game: gwent, faeria, magic, HEX, hearthstone since launch....

Good job Valve wiht this game so far. For a long time success it depends on the market/economy and how this game will evolve. For starters they did a good job. I recommend everyone to try it. Don't hesitate beacuse you have to spend a few bucks, because what you can do without paying anything more is much more than in the other games.....e.g. private tournaments...finally!

PRO:
+ many modes (private tournaments, free draft, normal draft, phantom draft, bot matches, special modes like call to arms where you can play with pre selected decks and battle others playing with one of these decks....totally awesome...because its fair from a card persepctive and only skill matters....ANd you can play with decks /cards you dont own)
+ interesting mechanics (not every card battle loss is bad)
+ no direct game ending due to bad card draw
+ no grind necessary like in other games (when you play you play ;-)
+ seems good balanced (but hard to say so early)
+ close and really exciting matches possible (so far no total hard counters)

CON:
- for beginners a little bit hard at the beginning
- no way to earn cards (except from draft with real money)
- RNG is hear sometimes annoying
- no ladder system
- long term motivation? esport relevance?

Looking forward to the evolution. So far valve directly responded to community feedback...hopefully this continues.

TOP...and stop crying about other things here please. By the wy this game is not pay to win because if youo suck you suck and no money will let you win.
Artifact has the best monetization system of all online trading card games: You may purchase single cards in the market place. Other card games require you to purchase or grind multiple hours for booster packs. As a result a lot of luck and huge investments are needed to receive your desired cards. A competitive deck costs around 20-60€ whereas you need to invest about 200-300€ in Hearthstone to end with a competitive deck.
The three-lane system is fresh and fun. Draft mode is really cool. Casual draft does not require you to have any cards: You may purchase Artifact, sell all your cards and play draft for quality time.
It's a fun game, the monetization is that similar to an IRL card game. That leaves me with mixed feelings as I sorta like that model more than hearthstone, a lot more. But again, everything is virtual so it's not like I can ever hold or really "collect" them. 
Leaving the money out of it, it's a great card game, far more interesting that hearthstone or Magic in my opinion
So to put my feelings into this, Ive played games like this for quite a while now and after playing hearthstone for a while I have to say some people need to chill, yes AXE is expensive but Im certain there will be a huge price drop just like any other item on the market, or it will be nerfed. this game has a refreshing take on the CCG genre with 3 lanes which makes me think alot more and with card by card turns I think this game is more intense and complex to its counterparts in the genre, it makes deifinate sense. yes the game isnt perfect right now but I think it definatley needs more time, like a good bottle of wine.
A lot of people are upset about this games monetization, I can see where they are coming from but if you're serious about card games, this system is much less frustrating that the other onlince tcgs.  Being able to pay for whatever card you want is so refreshing, especially because you can sell them later.  

The gameplay itself is fantastic.  Easily my favorite online card game.  Very deep mechanics that at a baseline are easy to learn but hard to master.
Had to write this review due to the overwhelming ammount of negative reviews from kids who have hit their monthly allowance for games.
It is a TCGame and a goddamn good one at that, there is no need to review the mechanics as they are top notch so lets just get to the other things.
So you start up the game, do the tutorials and get your 10 packs- after opening them, chacnes are you got ~10 eur worth of cards back, if not more. If you do not suck at games, you will get infinite amount of card packs and tickets from Phantom Draft. You have to recycle 20 cards to get new even ticket (its like 0.6 eur) so its fine.

Don't forget that this is Valve and they will add the rankings and progression within a month just to control this PR shitstorm.
Just buy the game, it's thinking mans' chess.
What's here is amazing.  It will hurt your brain in a good way to play this game.

I'm sure there will be improvements, and a ranked ladder over time, but the core game play is fantastic.  

There are a multitude of cards on the community market that are 4 cents, and the game has only been out a few days.  

You can craft a decent constructed deck on the cheap, and individual skill goes a LONG way to assuring a victory.

There's drafting as well, MTGA is $5 for a draft, it's cheaper here.  I really think there are a bunch of kids that want to "earn" 10 cents an hour doing shitty, unfun, card quests.

I don't get all the hate this game is getting, if you want to grind hours a day to get that 1 card pack in that other popular card game, and not even get the cards you want, have fun with that.  Less people like you populating this game anyway, which is better quality people and games for me!


Great CCG with incredibly deep and fun gameplay, great visuals and will have great continued support such as the progression system that valve is planning as their top priority.

If you're worried about the economy, in two days (only playing 1 expert draft), I have made £12.35 after buying this game by selling cards on the market, basically refunding the original price of the game, I also still have the same amount of event tickets (needed for the draft runs with rewards) that I started the game with. I cannot understate enough how much the market makes the economy in Artifact far better then any other CCG out there.

Most of these reviews are knee-jerk reactions to the fact that it doesnt have grinding for a chance to get a card like every other game, without actually thinking about the system in this game, where you can easily trade cards to get others using the market. This was never stated to be in the game. It's like buying a tomato sandwich and then being annoyed there's no meat in it. Or because they angry that valve is releasing a game that isn't HL3 which is never gonna happen.


I haven't played a ton of Artifact yet, however, I've been thrououghly enjoying myself. There is a bit of a steep learning curve that takes a few hours to adjest to (especially if you come from Hearthstone like myself). Once I understood the game, I got back-to-back 5 win runs in the draft mode. I'm looking forward to playing this game more this weekend to see what type of depth exists in the strategy behind this game.
Having played many card games, the monetization of this game is the most reasonable I've ever seen.  You can build a competitive constructed deck for much much less than many similar "F2P" games. 

I do think that there needs to be some more progression and rewards for both casual and expert modes.

The gameplay itself is excellent.  Deep systems that allow for lots of variety even within the same deck archetypes. 

I'm having lots of fun and hope people give this game a shot.
Short version: Is it good/worth playing? Yes. Does the economy feel bad compared to Hearthstone or MTG:A? Yes, especially if you aren't used to spending money a la physical TCG's.

With the purchase price of the game, you get 10 packs and 5 event tickets (used to enter competitive modes, which can earn you more packs). Casual/Social draft and constructed modes are 100% free, but currently offer no rewards, which is perhaps my only gripe with Artifact.

My suggestion to Valve would be to add event tickets as a reward for Perfect Runs in the casual modes, or maybe make free Draft Tournaments that reward packs to the top percentage of players. Just anything at all so that people who don't want to drop money or can't afford to spend more feel like they're getting something out of playing.
It's an awesome game with a very interesting economic model. 

Really new game into the card-game genre with some interesting mechanics that brings games to a hole new level of thinking.
Hello , guys !
This is my first review in English . Sorry for this :D 
I started play artifact in 11/19/2018 (OBT time ).
In my opinion Artifact have been taking all people who playing in MTG, Gwent and a bit audience of Hearthstone , because HS it's different CCG (collection card game) . Ok , let's go .

Positive sign about Artifact :
+ Middle game meta  . All matches passing on twenty - thirty minutes , and this is cool .
+ Which card are you want ? Community market can help you ,  Axe ? Draw Ranger ? Don't buy many packs , just buy hero .
+ For Artifact you must have a brain , whout intellect you can't pick good cards and create normal decks . ( - hearthstone players 4Head )

Negative sides Artifact :
- No end of pouring money . I think it's main and single trouble .

Thanks you for reading , my friend <3 If you can , write feedback please :)

All these people complaining would rather spend $50 in Hearthstone to try and get one specific legendary than spend $50 on the Steam Marketplace to get majority of a full collection, or gamble through multiple pack openings to try and get a particular card rather than spend a few cents to buy it specifically.
Best price system for a card game. Buy decks you wanna play staight up for likw 20 pound and infinite arena mode. Honestly reviews are just from hurt hearstone fanboys
Coming from Magic the Gathering, as a huge limited player.  The $20 for infinite phantom drafts is well worth the price of admission.  As for whether or not it is worth getting into constructed, I'm still waiting to see.  The gameplay in general is incredibly fun, with tons of decisions to make and layers of strategy.  It has been some time since I've been this excited about a card game, and once I finally got my hands on the game I can say it is well worth it.
Great game for people who are looking for an actual TCG experience, while being A LOT cheaper than an actual TCG. Many of the negative reviews are merely people whining because they would rather play a F2P skinner trap where you have to grind for $0.10 an hour to earn packs with the hopes of opening the cards you want.

No need for that here. You can buy any card you want directly from other users on the market. And if you ever want to quit, you can sell your deck to recoup some of your money. Unlike every other online card game like HS or MTG, where your investment is gone forever.
My experience with the game so far:

- Played a few games of casual draft (that one that requires no entry fee, so you can play it infinitely for practice or, you know, JUST FOR FUN)
- Realized draft decks are actually way easier to build than in MTGA or Hearthstone, and matchmaking by victories actually makes it not that hard to go to 3+ wins
- Decided to give keeper draft a go
- Got 17 euros worth of rares, sold them right away to get more packs (I expect the prices to drop soon)
- Went 4-2, got back my entrance fee + 2 extra packs
- Recycled extra commons, got two more tickets

So far I had tons of fun for 7 hours, got to open 15 packs, and I have 7 more waiting, as well as 9 event tickets. What the fuck, Volvo, I thought this was supposed to be a scam?!

So yeah, while the game is obviously way less f2p-friendly than for instance Gwent (although if you're mostly interested in draft it almost kinda is), if you came here to say that it's greedier than Hearthstone, please PLAY THE FUCKING GAME FIRST.


On an unrelated note, the game is pretty damn fun too.
Having spent a good number of hours playing Dota I decided I wanted to check out Artifact. I really enjoy the uniqueness of playing a card game with 3 effective boards.  This game doesn't reward you with packs of cards but I'm fine with that as I consider Artifact to be a card game first, video game second.  You can't play a new physical card game without first going to the store and buying cards.  The Steam marketplace has all the cards available (most, it seems, under 1$) and while I don't own an Axe (currently priced at 27$) I don't need him.  Phantom draft is plenty of fun - you don't need a collection to play with all the cards in the game.  In phantom draft everyone starts from the same place - with nothing.
if you like magic and drafting cards this is really good! lost 4 hours straight right after installing trying out all the free things you can do. if you dont care to keep cards then casual play is awesome. draft a deck and see how far it goes or redraft. sell your booster pack cards if you want your money back and just play for free!
I spent the $20 on artifact and sold cards i opened to lower that cost to $12. By owning the base game you can indefinitely play draft for free and also build pauper (low rarity) decks for around $1-2. Theres plenty of fun to be had without buying a top tier deck.

Having an open market like paper magic has great advantages like building fun decks on the cheap that arent using the broken cards, hence the birth of Commander in mtg, a mash of weird cards making the best format in the game. MTG Arena sorely lacks this thus requiring infinite grinding. 

However Artifact has poor archetyping, it'll probably take an expansion or two for the designers to make the fringe decks more viable, right now you essentially play goodstuff the deck.

If you don't heavily grind the other card games then a t1 deck in artifact will be a bit cheaper to build, moderate grinding gets you almost nowhere in those games anyway. I personally don't think this games a cash grab, but i would prefer slightly lower market fees. 

Also good luck finding a card game that lets you build t1 decks on the cheap but is still actually a good game.
Great game, great mechanics, great graphics. You can play casual draft for free, no need to buy cards. I'm very exited for the competetive future of this game because i want to be part of it!
Artifact so far has been a dreadful pleasure to play. The game is simply amazing and has a lot of awesome features, but all suffers from under thought features that… is clearly deterring people away from the game and besmirching an otherwise amazing product.

**The review is very long, so to sum it up… I do recommend the game to people who enjoy playing card games and want to have a new and refreshing experience, but to those who are wary on spending money in anyway, than I say hold up on purchasing artifact till it becomes more fledged out and becomes worthy of its current price tag.**
_______________
Pros-
Mechanics: Artifact is filled with many similar and yet new mechanics to the card game genre. It blends a lot of notions of new and old together that provides a rather refreshing take on what digital card games are missing currently. I myself is a MTG fan and the one big thing MTG has done well is introduce mechanics and constantly make the game feel deep and allow for stronger diversity in play and experience. Artifact has MTG levels of depth while also having easy to read features like Hearthstone… frankly it is a simple love child between the two which is done right on its game-play aspect!

Steam Market: The Steam market is… a bit of a double edge sword, but that being said, it is also what truly sets it apart from almost every Digital Card game on the market. Having the Steam Market Place in the game helps put a lot in perspective on how affordable the game actually is when you’re trying to make a deck! Many cards costing cents on the dollar while only a few are costing close to $20ish. Something that players do not understand when they play games like Hearthstone or many other F2P CCGs is the fact that they have 0 experience or very little with how an actual CCG/TCG is meant to work IRL… aka you trade/ purchase a lot of induvial cards from people in order to make what you want. MTG itself has some crazy priced cards on all spectrums, this goes to same with Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh. You will find expensive and cheap cards and frankly some of them will be unexpected in how low their price tag is. Point is, the SMP opens up a lot of freedom and understanding for how a player may go about expanding on the game without feeling like they need to spend an arm and a leg to get there. Remember, you only need 1 Axe in your deck, not 3… unless you want to build a deck that way!

Card Packs: So card packs are kind of crazy awesome, like in MTG your card pack will consist of consistent and random elements, but for $1.99 you receive a rather high and generous amount of cards unlike other CCG/TCG out there. You get 12 cards, out of the 12 you will always receive 1 hero card of varying rarity and at least 1 rare card and a few uncommon cards. The card rarities can also be randomly promoted, so you could get more uncommon and rare cards in your card packs.

Casual Play: Casual play is the real bread and butter of the game. Casual play mimics a large extent of Expert Play without hit you with a money wall… in a way. Casual Constructed does require you to have cards which is… not a highlight of the game currently, but Casual Phantom Draft is hands down the best way to play when you want to have fun, learn the game, and get to just experience the game as intended IMO. You do not receive rewards for casual play… which I think we all hope will be changed when they release progress in the game. But as it is now, you do get to have fun without worrying about spending loads of money to just embrace and enjoy the game.
_______________
Cons- 

Monetization: Currently… the games monetization method at first glance comes off as greedy, but as I play I realize it is not so much as greedy as much as it is just too bold and feels forceful on players who actually want to collect and experience a large part of the game. Buy packs is not a problem, it is the ticket system that is very frustrating and sets a tone for how greedy the game truly comes off. Having to spend 5 dollars to get 5 tickets to play 2 of the expert mode venues and requiring 5 unopened packs and 2 of the tickets instead of 1 like the others makes the game feel like it is milking you for money. If you win 3 or more matches than you lose nothing, in fact you gain!  But if you lose 2 before you can win at least three… well you are at that point throwing your money away and that is just messed up.

No Progression: The game has 0 sense of progress. I understand that Valve is looking to fix this in the future, but until it is fixed… the game will constantly turn people off and will keep getting a bad reviewers. The fact is you are still paying to get into the game, there is a price tag and many players (including myself) expect to have a game in full without catches to it. That being said, when the game has progression and hopefully ways to generate cards/tickets without purchasing, the game will be very complete and feeling and all will get to truly experience it in its full glory as a great card game.

Price: The game cost $20, it is not a big price and frankly it costing money is not a problem… but the fact is we are paying for a card game that is swimming in a sea of many F2P card games. I understand the price is there to stop bots and such from being in the game, but it also stops people from wanting purchase the game when they have other alternatives to it… it is worse when these alternative simply do provide some kind of reward to just playing the game and help you generate and allow for good longevity while having Artifact not provide this at all. It is just bad business at that point.

Expert Play: The Expert Playlist is a toss-up of good and bad… but as of now it really just does not deliver well on a healthy game experience for the majority of players that get into the game. Currently Expert Play is very feast or famine and will leave many players with the feeling of wasting money if they do not get lucky. Expert Constructed and Phantom Draft both cost 1 ticket to enter while Keepers Draft cost 2 tickets and… 5 card packs. This mode rewards a combo of luck and skill in order to reap decent rewards that allow a player to expand their collection while being able to continue to take part in the Expert Mode, but at the same time these modes can easily cause you to lose at the most “$1” per failure to achieve 3 wins before 2 losses. Tickets at minimum cost $5 to replenish 5 tickets with their being no way to generate tickets besides paying for them or winning 3-5 matches in expert mode.
_______________
Over all, the game is in a tough spot. I hope Valve is listening to the correct side of their player base and introduces health features soon in order to revert the problems that are riddled throughout the game. I know some features that I hope to see would be; some cleaner telegraphing of turns and plays on the board, Casual Phantom providing maybe 1 card pack at 4 wins and 1 card pack and ticket at 5 wins, and weekly progression/ events which gives players cards/packs and a ticket for completing casual or expert game modes. Slow progression and card collecting is better than no progression at all!

In the end, Artifact is a game that people are purchasing and is competing against other F2P titles that are similar to it. Valve is far from a greedy company when compared to EA, Ubisoft, and Activision... They have the ability to fix the game and make it a true contender with out taking a knee and putting it in the same league of other F2P games which ARE greedy and want you to spend money as much as possible. Gotta trust the lord and master GABEN!
Artifact is a complex, high-skill ceiling card game that targets a very specific group of players. The visuals are stunning and the game itself is rewarding if a bit intimidating.

I'm not overly concerned with the business model - it is possible to play and draft (without keeping the cards) without spending any more money than the $20 entry fee. If you want to go further than that, it can get expensive - but this is a TCG and IMO that comes with the territory.
I am a long time TCG, CCG, LCG, digital card game player. Valve has put out an amazing game in Artifact. The three lane system is an absolute blast and the colors and heroes feel unique and fun to build around. I have little knowledge on DOTA 2 but that has not hindered my experience with this game. The matches last longer than your current industy leading digital games but they are in line with tabletop physical games. This feels like an adults game. The game is very strategy heavy and the elements of RNG are both tolerable and add to the fun.
 
Most negative reviews are from people who are used to the Freemium monetization model. They expect to be rewarded for playing the game. There are no rewards for simply playing but they do have tourneys that you can purchase tickets for to play for prizes. Because Valve chose this model, we have the ability to purchase individual cards on the market. Missing a card? Grab it for market value. There are no expectations that you have to log in daily to claim some sort of reward just to keep up with the top decks. There are no fake currencies. Valve treats us like adults and understands that time is money.

If you are interested in card games, tabletop games, strategy games, etc. do youself a favor and try Artifact!

if you are worried about cost relax. while you do need about $25 to get past precons and phantom drafts, if you are careful and patient you will enjoy this game. there is a thriving pauper community and it costs <$10 to get every common. uncommons are good with some clear exeptions. and rares are expected to fall in price once everything is stable as with every overhyped game.
Artifacts monetization model is more akin to a real life Trading Card Game than a digital card game, whether it is good or bad does not reflect on the actual gameplay or the review here. 

What Artifact does right. 

-The deckbuilder is easy and intuitive to use
-Game modes are fun and for the most part free with tournament support built in to the game itself. 
-Oozes with theme, from the imps, to the music, and the way cards interact. There is so much here that makes Artifact a joy to play, similar to Hearthstone
-Being able to purchase the cards you want for deck you want, no janky disenchanting or wildcard system.
-Cards that feel fair without harmful RNG (minus one glaring exception)

What it does wrong

- Paid game modes attached to a paid game. While players start with 5 tickets and can get a 6th fairly easily, there is  no free way to continue to play the expert game modes. With the "expert constructed" and prize supported phantom drafts behind  one ticket  and the Keeper draft behind 2 tickets AND a $10 USD fee, it leaves a lot to be desired. However, you can play constructed and phantom draft for free without prize support. 

-No progression. The only progression here is your own skill. No free "gold" or packs to be found. While this may be the most true conversion of paper TCG in a digital format, it is still a video game played on PC and certain expectations have been made by already established digital competitors. 

If these last two are deal breakers, then do not buy it. If you are interested in new card game that shakes up the traditional digital TCG format of "buy until you got it/can disenchant for it" and would prefer to just buy the cards, look no further.
It's fun! 

Assuming you are a normal adult, whos time is worth alot, so you hate f2p grinding games like hearthstone and just want to have some fun.


The strategic elements of the game are fascinating. The concepts of heroes and three lanes really seperate artifact from other card games. In terms of monetization, if you ever spend money on packs in other card games, then this game really shouldn't worry you that much. There are 12 cards each pack, and only three rarity (rare, uncommon, common). You are guranteed a rare each pack. You can also buy cards you need in the marketplace. It actually costs you less money to keep up your collection compare to other card games if you also spend money on packs in those game. For those who doesn't want to spend money on ticket, there is always the choice of casual phantom draft.
Card Market > Microtransactions

     So many complaints about the cost of the game... Have these people never played a card game? The "cost" to play will be less than others in the long run due to the market. 
     Don't want to spend a penny over $19.99? Then the generous casual game modes are just for you. The market is what will make this game great, not what is wrong with it.
Great TCG. Lots to learn, intense games. I started playing then 6 and a half hours went by without me noticing. I guess people are crapping on this, but it's not bad at all. You can buy all the cards for contructed you want from the market if that pleases you and they're cheap af save a few high value cards. 

You can play free versions of most of the modes. The outlier is Keeper Draft I believe because well, you keep the cards you draft.

I for one was very turned off of the game pre launch by all the negativity. I was not going to purchase it. But now I'm happy I did. I'm 1000% sure I'll get my 26 CAD worth.
The game is a ton of fun, it's like playing three hearthstone matches at once. One of the best things about the game is that you don't have to grind unnecessarily for card packs in the hopes you get the one card you needed. You can just purchase the specific cards you need from the marketplace and build the deck you want right from the start.
If you are a card game enthusiast then this game is for you plain and simple... There are many people on here who would give this a negative review before seeing a minute of game play just because they here this is not free to play. THIS GAME is not a pay to win, players got a full tier 1 deck spending under 35 dollars. To do that week one of a format or new expansion of any digital card game is near unheard of. So please dont let the many negative reviews of sour Sally's who did not get there way ruin your choice to play this game, the concept is clean and well done. The gameplay is solid and entertaining the whole way. Games are very swingy and you have to adapt to those swings to keep up or you lose. This will be a card game that requires multiple levels of understanding and has more depth then any card game I know. 
I started the game with 45 dollars post 20 dollar buy in I currently hold 145 tickets and got well over 100 dollars selling commons uncommons and rates. I play mostly keeper draft and the occasional phantom draft. One time just to see last night I strictly rare drafted just to see outcome with no real bomb rare I made 8 dollar and 3 tickets that's 11 dollars I was at a 1 dollar loss but I also added 3 rates to my collection. Dont let people tell you a card game is pay to win. The most you pay is a ticket and everyone is on an equal playing field.
Seriously, if you have ever played an actual TCG IRL, this is the digital game for you. Don't read into the negative reviews, most are f2p players from other games who are too used to grinding for packs. Valve has created an amazing ecosystem for their game and it actually is a fun game.
Love it, played 2500h of Druidstone, but this seems even more time absorbing. So many cool gamemodes, cool animations, card designs... everything was well thought through. Solid product, so far my new favourite TCG.

People who cry about it being too expensive should not even buy it in the first place, so don´t listen to them. A TCG requires you to BUY cards in order to have some. If you are not willing to spend a little bit of money, don´t buy it.
Out of even the 2.9 hours I've played of the game, I genuinely enjoy it! I love the artstyle, especially the astral loading/endgame screens, and I think the gameplay is truly exciting. Even though I've never played Dota 2 before, this game has been a pleasure to own, and I wholly suggest that anyone who doesn't already own it get it.
While not perfect in its current state, Artifact still offers a refreshing change of pace. Its long and methodical games, multiple game types and (most importantly) its method of monetezation will keep me coming back for at least the next couple weeks. Sure there are issues with a few auto include staples (Blink Dagger more than anything) and overtuned cards ruining the fun occassionally. The learning curve is steep as a motherfucker, too. 

But I want this model to work, I want *every* card game to be a TCG as opposed to a CCG. In the long run this game is so, so much more consumer friendly than Hearthstone and some other competitors. Comparing this to Magic or Yugioh, this game is signifcantly cheaper to play and compete in. If this does well it may force the hand of other card games to adapt a similar model of allowing us to sell our cards.

Cautiously optimistic about where this game is going, and it won't break the bank to try. Hell, if you pull Axe or a couple other cards you can sell it and bail out at a profit. Please don't fuck this up too badly, Valve!
[h1]On monetization:[/h1]
Most of the negative reviews about the monetization on this game are dumb. They are basically complaining about why is Artifact's genre its genre. This is a digital Trading Card Game (TCG). The business model is similar to non-digital TCGs such as "Magic: The Gathering" and "Yu-Gi-Oh!" wherein you have to buy cards to play with said cards. When you buy the game, what you really are paying for are the 10 packs and 5 tickets. 

The game is essentially free. You just have to have at least bought into it. Constructed is the only game mode that can cost a lot of money to play competitively because all game modes that can cost tickets directly reward packs. The three main game modes are also available for free, you just don't get anything for your wins. Draft and the events give every player the chance to play every card available. If you prefer the unpredicatability of the draft mode rather than the netdeck meta that plagues every TCG, Artifact will give you so much value cause you can just play draft without limit.
Great ingame mechanics, the game is complex and does not resemble other card games like Hearthstone where basically one plays on auto-pilot 90% of the rounds. There is a lot of room for improvement, like for exampe adding ranks or some way to earn free card packs through grinding, but I see a lot of potential in this game.
Break down of all the negative reivews:
- I didnt get every card in the game so this is a bad TCG. 
Because we all know how in every other TCG you get every card once you start playing for free.

Also all of them are ignoring the free phantom draft aka casual phantom draft (that in  away gives you all the cards). So yea, people can just play casual phantom draft if they dont want to invest in alot of money to play constructed.
Best card game I have ever played, by far. Highest skill-ceiling, versatility, comeback potential, depth and the amount of game modes make this game an epic piece.

Now there have been a lot of negative arguments about this game's payment model. The biggest drawback is the lack of free-to-play opportunities since there are no daily quests or in-game currency that could be grinded to play the game without spending money on it. For casual players, this may be problematic. However, for anyone else willing to spend at least something on this game, the product offers the lowest rates for digital cards compared to any popular card games out there. This is been confirmed by many Hearthstone/Gwent/Magic players. At first, I was preparing to sink hundreds of euros in to this game, but now I have invested nothing as I feel like there is no need to. I can play infinite games in draft and perhaps later, when the market prices crash, I could try constructed by buying the best cards cheap. 

All in all, I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a complex card game where the lines that lead to victory are under your control, rather than in the hands of RNG. I look forward to the upcoming content and expansions in this game, and valve already confirmed that they are working on a progression system as a first-line priority after launch.
Fun, challenging game. Tons of depth and the interactions between the various mechanics are wonderful to unwrap.

The pricing model honestly isn't bad compared to pretty much ever other CCG on the market.

If you don't want to pay beyond the buy in, you have free, infinite draft.
You get so much for $20. Free draft mode is awesome and the fact you can buy whatever cards you want on the market is great for constructed. If you like card and/or strategy games I recommend checking it out for sure.
oh no, I have to spend money in a CARD GAME!? >:((( Wheres my free to play model!?!? Let me grind 3hrs a day for a booster pack so I can save enough recycled currency to buy the next meta deck in 2 expansion! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.Pure money grab pyrimaid cash scheme MUMMY THEY WANT ME TO SPEND MORE OF MY GOOD BOY ALLOWANCE!!! OK Siri, Cheap Hearthstone Budge Decks for Beginners Easy To Pick Up. MUM I NEED THE 3 WACKY NUMBERS ON THE BACK OF YOUR CARD SO I CAN BUY BOOSTIE BOYS BECAUSE THEY WONT LET ME TRADE OR BUY MY CARDS DIRECT,,,,, I NEED TO LOOT BOX MY SHINIES!! WHENS DAD COMING BACK MUM!? ITS BEEN 3 YEARS I MISS HIM
I, for one, like Artifact. A lot. 

I understand the issue with the monetization stuff, however I find it quite honest and old school: if you want cards, you pay for them, just like playing mtg or similar. 

This game is not like Hearthstone, Gwent or Magic Arena. This game is more like Magic Online. It is a TCG, not CCG. People need to understand they are different genres, and TCGs are simply not cheap. You will not be able to build a tier 1 legacy deck in Magic Online "just by playing". 

So yeah, enjoy the game if you like it, go play something else if you don't, but please stop trying to turn Artifact into a CCG. There are many, many other CCGs out there where you can (technically) get everything for free, over time. I would much rather spend some initial money to make a deck I like in Artifact, then play 1 or 2 keeper drafts a week. Paying for it.
OMG bought this game cus it is awesome game and its really fun
but... its a total paid to win bull crap T_T at this stage at least 

spend so much money on cards ... and still dont have enough fking cards xD still need 375 dollars roughly to get close to enough .......
but then again you can totally still play this game without spending 5 dollars more than the base game if you just want to play casually 
5 dollars can get you a shit ton of cards on steam market for at least a decent starting deck 
mainly cus its like 0.05 cents for the cheapest cards 

if i dont have to spend this much money on the cards i would say 10/10 great card game should buy loads of fun
Great game. Plenty of complexity to keep you busy. Tons of stuff to do if you don't want to spend mondy (pre-constructed gauntlet, phantom draft, etc).
This game is AMAZING! I have lost so much but the complexity and all the shite surrounding it has kept me going! Its just so much fun to load up a match, every match is like a mini brain puzzle and I love it! Highly reccommend.
First, let's get the biggest thing out of the way: the monetization. 

1. Valve explained all of this beforehand so I do not understand the complaining for getting exactly what you were told you were going to get. 

2. I grew up with ACTUAL CCG's, playing Magic: The Gathering.  That's how they were built. You pay for cards or trade for them. I spent $3 every weekend for a new booster. This game is much cheaper and the people complaining need to grow up.  How do you expect to get games for free all the time? And pay to win? Some of my best moments were beating my friends with expensive decks with my pauper deck.  GIT GUD.   Expecting to be able to get full playability out of a game when you pay nothing, compared to people who pay for it, is stupid. Some games have this model, but this isn't one of them and more importantly, Valve never said it would be. 

3. There are not any free to play card games that are not pay to win to some extent.  The beauty of this is it allows you to buy the cards you want for the decks you want. You can sell off things you aren't using to create what you want.  This is how CCG's were made.  All these downvotes are people with temper tantrums because they can't suck off of someone else's teet for free.  Please go to a car dealership and tell them how you want a car for free, and people with money should only be able to get aesthetic options like decals or leather seats. 

Now, the game:

Damn, it is challenging.  There are so many facets to the game it will not be for everyone. Nor does it try to be.  It is easy to get blinders on, focusing on each lane as an independent unit.  And then suddenly, "shots fired!" from another lane and you realize that you should zoom out the board and look at everything. 

One of the best feelings is that it does seem to have the same build up as Dota.  For anyone who has played Dota, the build up gets to the point, where end game, a small mistake can end the game.  The power curves in Artifact feel the same way.  You can make mistakes early, but the combos that can pop off end game force you to play perfectly. 

One of the downsides, is that matches in other card games can be done somewhat fast.  Because of the 3 lane system, I was surprised at how long an individual game could take.  It is a little long for my liking, but I don't see how you can do it without getting rid of lanes. 

I think drafting will be my favorite part as making decks on the fly is a way to balance the difference in people's collections.  Draft was my favorite mode in Magic as well. 

I doubt this will be as popular for player base or esports as Hearthstone is.  It is not as easy to pick up, which will put some people off. Also, for esports, I am curious as to how they will keep an eye on the whole board. It seems like a lot of information to process while watching considering the fast turn times. 

tl;dr : It's a fun game not for everyone. People who still expect free things after being told they aren't going to get free things need to stop throwing tantrums.
I really like it. For me, the monetization model is much better than HS, particularly without having to resort to dusting to get the cards I want. I like that the cards hold value. The game itself is spectacular, and I really love it. It's very well balanced.
Artifact is the best digital card game I've played. I was not at all hyped or excited to play it, but after trying it myself, I can safely say that it's a game that you need to sit down and experience for yourself. I think that everyone can agree that the gameplay is great, so let's move on to what I feel is holding some people up.
As for the monetisation, anyone who plays MTG will be very familiar with what Valve is doing. I was hesitant before understanding how they've set up the game. Your 20 dollars covers the two full starter decks, ten packs, and five tickets. There are no "free cards" like in Hearthstone,  just like a physical card game you have to buy the product to play it. You can then use your new cards to play "casual" formats as much as you want, set up tournaments with your friends or start matchmaking online. Tickets, however, are used as a premium to enter what is essentially a Friday Night Magic tournament, win enough rounds and you'll get free packs, but unlike Magic, you will also win tickets for another free entry. In the perfect world, you could win every game you play and never spend another penny and still earn the packs and cards. Tickets are the equivalent of a buy-in to an event. You can also recycle 20 cards for a ticket, or sell your cards to essentially trade for other cards off the Steam market. Implementing all these features has basically converted your local gaming store into the game client.
With that all in mind, I am sure Valve is listening to everyone's complaints and I have little doubt that they will be changing things for the better, like with adding casual phantom draft.
This is a fun game with a lot of complexity and choices built into the 3 lane turn structure. Very refreshing and outside of the box design. If you are a fan of TCG's and are looking for something deep, fun, and unique I highly recommend giving it a shot.
[b]The Golden Standard of Polish, Production Value and Game Design[/b]

Artifact is a well-engineered title that anyone should try. The base game for 20 dollars alone can offer hundreds of hours of high-quality entertainment. The game's video and audio design are both appealing, it's a candy for eyes, ears and the mind. The gameplay is refined - very deep, yet accessible. Artifact can be a fulfilling hobby for master strategists and the casual weekend players for a long, long time.

[i]more to be written...[/i]
Game is really fun especially with a friend, ignore the posts crying about monetization and that its P2W anyone thats played steam games and bought skins off the market knows that most cards here are only a few cents too a dollar. Compared to hearthstone where you have to spend dozens if not hundreds of dollars just to keep up in the meta of the game as well as relying on RNG to get the OP cards. In Artifact everything can be OP and if you win 1 lane theres still 2 other lanes you have to deal with. Game is great and well designed! Deff buy it and im recommending it to all my friend
Beautiful, fun, and sufficiently complex without feeling overwhelming. Incredibly intelligent economy design that doesn't feel predatory. $1 drafts are all anyone can ever ask for, and free phantom drafts bring me happy tears.  I look forward to how Artifact will develop as a TCG.
This game is insanely good. The games feel very close and every decision matters. Lots of room for mind games and many lines of play every turn. Fairly monetized for a CCG. Free draft mode is enough for weeks of fun. Highly recommend for any serious CCG player.
I'm not much of a card game guy but this game is pretty darn fun.

I'm really surprised though by all of the uneducated/kneejerk negative review from people demanding free stuff.

It's a freaking trading card game, this stuff isn't supposed to be free, and the entry fee of $20 is just masking the cost of 10 packs.

This is the among the cheapest TCGs out there and blows everything else out of the water value wise, having infinite phantom draft is a great value.  Every other game will have you grinding 400+ hours or dumping $500+ to even get a decent deck.  Artifact's complete deck I think clocks in at under $200, but you don't HAVE to have every card.

The game still needs to add a lot of things like rankings and such, but it's already on their roadmap and will arrive in time.

You don't have to play this game, you don't have to like TCGs, yes it costs some money to get a decent constructed deck, but it's many many many times cheaper almost every card game out there.
So far clocked in around 10 hours and I gotta say I really enjoy it! Draft is amazing, the game is really tense and hard but definitely enjoyable. I understand the complaint people have about its monetization but I feel like at the end of the day its cheaper than other current card games on the market like hearthstone or MTGA. I would definitely recommend checking it out even if its just for the phantom draft modes.
Incredibly deep and strategic TCG. This is likened to 4D MTG, and it does engender a more hardcore strategy based gameplay, as there are many more options within each Game themselves, rather than each decision made during Deckbuilding. If you have played Hearthstone, Magic, Eternal, Gwent, or other card games and felt them lacking in deep gameplay and strategy, then this is the game for you. If you are a more casual player who wants to get a game or two in before work or school, this is NOT the game for you. For that, there's honestly not much better than Hearthstone.
I have not been playing long but I've been really enjoying the free draft experience. The game is beautiful and the tutorial made me feel very prepared to jump in and have fun.
The most fun I've had with a card game in a long time. Don't be fooled by the monteization whiners, purchase price gets you infinite access to the most competitive mode (Phantom Draft).
Still learning but so far, great game! 

You have access to all cards in Draft Mode, which is honestly much more fun than playing against 200€ constructed decks - and saves you from spending money. 
Once you're confident in your drafting skills you can head over to expert mode and start winning card packs. This costs tickets (you start with 5), but if you practiced enough in casual mode beforehand you should easily come out on top. 

From what I've seen, private tournaments with friends are a blast. Great way to try out some new decks or strategies as well.

Overall, stunning gameplay with superb voice-acting. Learning curve seems quite steep, but definitely rewarding with deep, variable, and complex strategies and deck combinations.
Great game, with loads of new innovative ideas and features for an online card game. I really like how it is based on dota and how it is the method for valve to announce new content in Dota 2. I love it, but I hope that Valve somehow revises the subtle pay to win structure, even though it isn't really that bad at alll, like in MTG games you have to pay for packs as well, maybe they sholud work in a gmae currency you earn from playing and you cna buy packs with that.
Incredibly skill testing and addicting game. Excellent  visuals and soundtrack. Pretty much everything I've wanted from a card game. Valve have really outdone themself here.

Economy isn't half as bad as it seems at first glance. If you just want to play draft it's completely free after the initial 20$ purchase. If you get good at draft you can even earn steam money by playing expert gauntlet.
wow, just wow.
i always wanted a game like this which you don't need to pay around $200 per month to be able to win (you know what game i mean)
i didn't expect this game to be this fun and challenging, you can always come back, once i had 2 towers on 1 hp and i still won.
you suprised me valve, gg wp.
btw i really recommend this game to everyone.
Very fun and refreshing game. Be aware of the monetization model before you buy! Some might hate the model but imo it is much preffered to something like hearthstones.
Fantastic game with the best payment system for digital card games. A full set of the cards is significantly cheaper than any other digital card game's single set (significantly!) options to resell cards for other cards and Valve actually respects the players time. 

It is unfortunate that this game has low reviews due to a bunch of people who don't understand how beneficial and superior an actual TCG is to grindstone trash games. Play any deck you want right from the start and no shitty feeling of skinnerbox games like hearthstone.
The best card game I've ever played. The skill ceiling is incredibly high and strategic play will take you much further than draw rng or deck construction. In the time I've played, I've never had a single non game due to rng or felt like a match was decided by anything other than player decisions. Every single game feels unique and different, particularly in draft mode. For 20 dollars, you're getting thousands of hours of entertainment and if you want to be competetive or play meme decks then you can cheaply do that via the market. If you've ever spent money on another "f2p" card game you know how expensive it is to actually get what you want, but here you just buy those cards and be done with it. Most of them are selling for pennies at the time this was written with a hanful of Rares and uncommons selling for more than a couple of dollars. The value you get for your money is just much higher than in similar games. Of cource, the initial 20 dollars gives you a great standalone experience too. You get unlimited free drafting, access to bots capable of playing any deck you want them to, access to community/friend tournaments, and preconstructed matchmaking. It's well worth it if a highly strategic card game with impactful decision making sounds like fun to you.
Best card game out and not close.  Actually cheaper than any others but I do not expect casuals to understand.  Game is truly better off without them anyway.
Between this,  MTG Arena, and Hearthstone (and the countless others that haven't made too much of a splash) the online TCG space is getting a bit crowded; that's not a bad thing though as I feel these 3 games are each different enough to satisfy anyone interested.  Is Artifact the best of the 3? I'm not sure yet but I'm definitely intrigued.
As for the monetization; I feel like it's fine as long as you know what you're getting.  You just have to treat this game more like a physical game;  unless you invest the money, you will not be able to own every deck in the game.  That's okay though.  The stakes incentivize players to actually play the game.
A lot of people are salty because this game isn't free. In reality, no TCG is really free. True you can play MTGA or HS and eventually earn packs, but the time commitment is ridiculous and sets rotate out. People have become stingy and spoiled with those business models despite them being extremely inefficient and toting the "FREE" sign to try and yank people in. Play HS or MTGA for 3 hours, how many packs do you get? Now go flip burgers for 3 hours, how many packs do you get?

On to the relevant stuff. The game is fun, the strategy is pretty deep, and I can't wait to see future sets and how they will shape and change the game over time.
Great game. Always feels like you have a chance to win despite bad starts in games.

You can buy the cards you want and sell them if you every want to stop playing.

Valve is one of the only companies able to offer a TCG with cards that have value outside the game itself.
Take a good hard look at the monetization model. It's upfront and honest, and if you think you're okay with supporting an upfront and honest game that costs money, then you can buy it. Gameplay wise, I think it's wonderful, it's just people have been buying it without doing any research into how the game is played, then becoming upset when they realize they need to spend money.
The gameplay is very rewardiing, it feels like every choice you make is a small difference that adds up over time into the culmunation of a victory. Almsot every game has been extremely close which make the losses almost as fun as the wins, almost. There are small RNG elements like where the creeps spawn and the arrow direction for their attacks, but these don't feell quite as swingy as RNG in certain other online card games. Overall I have really enjoyed the gameplay and the only question mark I have can only be decided once the market settles and the price of decks and playing really becomes apparent.
People complainging about monotization and P2W, read below:

This game is trying to replicate Magic the Gathering, which is a very expensive physical card game. Single cards can cost hundreds of dollars, most pros have decks they spent a lot of money on. MTG is very P2W if you want to be competetve, but it also offers a lot of budget ways to stay competetive.

This game allows you to buy single cards off the steam marketplace, players see that and get upset that people with money can just buy good decks. The reality is this game is pretty affordable. Buying the game for $20 gets you a solid starter collection and enough event tickets to get your feet wet.

After that, buying a vaible deck costs around $10-$15 dollars. That's insnae value compared to other TCGs, online and physical. You wont find that kind of value in Hearthstone. 

For a total of $45, including the game purchase, I was able to craft 2 very good decks to use in constructed. 

There is also free game modes that can be played that are tons of fun. Don't let the "P2W" mechanics turn you away, the game is very cheap to get into.
This game is really fun. I made a constructed deck with my initial packa and beat players with all of the expensive hwroes/cards. Was also able to sell a lot of the cards I didn't want and buy a lot of the ones I wanted.
Great game, really having a good time with it. Limitless free constructed and phandom draft for fun, and the decks are getting cheaper and cheaper for top tier (20-50 bucks). Selling some csgo skins I'm able to get 2 really nice decks plus tons of extra cards to mess around with. The full set price is dropping under $200, which is insane if you have played card games before. 

The game itself is extrememly fun, actually more than I thought it would be. The games are very close and it feels like a comeback is always possible with the lane mechanics. Basically, I wanted a new, fresh game that I could hop aboard while everyone was in the same boat as me, and I've found it. The UI is really good, especially the ways you can shop for cards. In the deck builder you can build your dream deck and for any cards you don't already own, they are added to a nice interface at the bottom where you could instantly buy them from the steam market place. Selling cards is just as easy, where navigating to the "Sell Cards" tab you can see your collection plus each cards price. 

If you are interested in the game, do yourself a favor and try it before dismissing it due to the reviews. It is something to experience.
The draft mode alone is worth way more than the purchase price. Last night we had a small tourney with some friends, and that was the most fun I had in a card game since forever.
I would sell this game to you by pointing out that If you have experience with limited formats in card games, know that artifact has one of the best and deepest draft modes out there. Also unlike most every other free to play game on the market this one costs 20$ but allows you to play prizeless drafts completly free forever.

Constructed is less well recived but passable for being the first set, and more importantly diferent from your typical tcg. Lots of depth with a high skll ceiling. Economy is not f2p though so be warned if your looking for a monetization model like HS, this game wont appeal to you. To me this game epitomizes the idea that not all games will apeal to all people, but if the idea of a more board and position oriented tcg sounds like your jam, and you dont mind a traditional tcg style economy I highly recommend you try it out.
Really good game.. Mechanics are on point.. if you dont want to play competitive, then you dont have to pay money for the cards because the draft mode is better than constructed in my opinion.
And even if you want to play competitive with constructed decks, you can easily buy the cards on the market..
In a world saturated by F2P model card games, this goes back to a more traditional card game economy. That part isn't for everyone, but the game itself is incredible. 

Being able to do free player vs player phantom drafts as much as you want is a feature that will easily net you your $20 worth if that's what you're into. If you're looking to play constructed, expect to spend significantly more than the initial $20.
First of all, one of the best TCG's I've played - finally got that addicted feeling for a game again.

It's also way cheaper than other CCG/TCG's. I've invested like 200+ bucks on HS, in Artifact you could build the most expansive decks for like 25$. A budget Deck for under 5$.

One Event Ticket costs 20-30 cents, when you buy out 20 cheap cards from Marketplace.

For experienced players it's somewhat possible to go infinite in draft mode. For inexperienced players there is a casual draft mode completely for free.

I don't understand how everyone is so negative.
Very unique card game experience, I like the idea of having three sperate lanes to deal with. This idea keeps the game fast paced, and my favorite part: if you are getting utterly destroyed in a lane, the game isn't over. There are still two other lanes to deal with. 

This mechanic alone makes managament of the board very engaging, and its a great referesher coming from someone who has played just about every online card game out there.

My only gripe is that there is no rank that you can see in constructed, but from what I can tell it's being worked. Give it a shot, my attitude was "if I dont like it, refund it." 

As for the cards actually costing money, I've always been a fan of trading cards and them having real value, but wasn't a fan of meet ups at card shops or other venues to trade cards. Now I have the ability to have that authentic TGC experience without having to travel.
Artifact is one of the deepest most rewarding card games i've played.

I have played TCG's since magic the gathering, pokemon, and starwars the TCG. Like way back in the day. And of all that i've ever played or been interested in, none of those games gives the player as many opportunities to make mistakes or intelligent plays quite like Artifact.

This can be a double edged sword. On the one hand it will never be as accessible as something like hearthstone. For me personally that's a good thing, as the way a deck plays out in hearthstone is often times pretty linear. In Artifact it is anything but. For example, there are over 40 different heroes for you to make decks with in any 5 hero combination. So for anyone running something like a mono blue control deck, there are multiple flavors partially driven by hero choices within that deck to fit lots of different play styles.

The market is also a very interesting aspect of this game. Most digital card games (hearthstone mtg:a etc) are free to play, and also allow you to play the game and unlock cards for free (over a long period of time). The catch is that you can't trade those cards or do anything with them, really you are just unlocking content via playtime(most choose to pay and open at least some packs anyway in those games). In Artifact by contrast, you can trade or sell any cards you buy or earn. (earning through playing gauntlet/draft/keeper draft) So in essence while no, you can't get cards for free, and likely will never be able to (due to cards having value as a tradeable commodity) they will retain some value, and you can always sell them and buy other things with the money you have spent on the game. This to me is vastly more fair than the money black hole that many of these digital card games have become.

I could go on and on, but really people just need to try it themselves. For 20 dollars you can't really go wrong, especially with the free draft mode where you can experiment and learn the ins and outs of cards for free(imagine arena in hearthstone, only its free for practice).


The short answer to the monetization question is that if you are planning to pay on a card game, this is the most affordable one.

There are no predatory schemes to milk money out of you. You can buy every single card you like without grinding or opening a blind box (although you can open a card pack if you wish). You get infinite access to Draft, which by itself is better than all other games which gate you behind fake currency.

What you see is what you get. Don't like what you see? This is fine, not all games appeal to all gamers. You do like what you see? Then come on in and enjoy a rich and enjoyable game.
Fantastic game, lots of critical moments to make big decisions. Deck building seems interesting although I haven't launched into that yet.

Monetization is generous as long as you don't have a "must be F2P" mind set. Don't look at this as a hearthstone competitor, look at this game as a TCG that you can play online for way cheaper than your average physical card game.

Lots of people bombing the game unjustly.
Fantastic mechanics for a card game. Will cater to any hardcore player. 

The people who are slating it because of it's monetization scheme clearly do not have very much experience with card games, Artifact is looking to have one of the best economies out of any online card game, don't let the other reviews fool you into thinking otherwise. If you plan to play any card game seriously then you're going to have to bite the bullet and spend some money, plain and simple. 


This is a TCG (Trading Card Game) not a CCG (Collectible Card Game). Buying and Selling cards are core parts of the game. The game starts you off with significant amount of cards which you can trade on the community marketplace. 

The majority of negative reviews complaining about microtransactions are ignoring the fact that you can purchase every single card for dirt cheap on the Steam Community Marketplace. Other games like Hearthstone require throwing hundreds of dollars at RNG for certain cards whereas in Artifact you can simply acquire them from other players.

Q: What about all the reviews about having to pay?
A: The base game comes with 10 free packs (1 pack = 2$) that get you 120+ cards . These are enough to build multiple decks for various playstyles. Once you get the hang of the game, you can sell the cards you dont use in order to buy the ones you need. Cycle your cards, dont just sit on all of them.

Q: What if I want access to all the cards, even the ones I dont own?
A: There are game modes (Casual Phantom draft)  that let you use cards from the entire existing pool (Yes, even cards that you dont own). This lets you try out various decks/cards as many times as you'd like.

Q: Can I earn more packs/decks/cards simply by playing?
A: If you are good at the game, yes. The game has a system where you pay in 'tickets' to play in a risk vs reward match against another player. Winning lets you earn the 'tickets' back and earn packs/decks. Base game comes with 5 free tickets. If you run out, you have to purchase more for a dollar each.

Q: Do I have to pay to be competitive?
A: Yes. About 2$-8$ to build a competitive deck from the marketplace. Give it a week for the prices to drop and it'll be even cheaper.

+CONS
- No personal stat tracking (Win/Loss etc. Will probably be added in the future updates)
This game is awesome! Anyone coming from Magic The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh or any other TCG will appreciate this game. People saying this game is Pay2Play and expensive and other negative things don't actually know how TCG-s work. The game is out for 12 hours, prices of some cards are still going up and down and nothing is set in stone yet. There are only 2 cards above 10€ right now and they are NOT needed to play or have fun in this game. Of course, the game itself is going to be a money sink for some players eventually, like any other TCG including Magic iitself, but as I said, you will still be able to enjoy it without spending much.

The game has excellent mechanics, beautiful aesthetics, polished animations, amazing lore and great deckbuilding.

The game needs more things like ranking and other progress tracking, but as it is mentioned, it wil be added. 

I can recommend this game for many things. 
Any TCG, CCG, LCG player will like it! 
Thanks Valve!
I love the game. It's a ton of fun and very complex, and there are a lot of modes and preconstructed decks to play with. I've played a lot of card games before, and in this one you feel the most that the game result rewards good play and you had a ton of different lines that you could've taken.
It's weird to read all the comments that talk about how it's too expensive. Lol I've bought the game and I now have access to 3 base decks, 6 event decks, and unlimited Phantom drafts. I have played 9 hours learning the basics and I honestly don't see myself sinking any money into this. 

There is no real benefit, at least for me, to play expert draft vs casual draft. As I'm still learning the game my winrate isn't the best so there's little chance I'd win any of the prizes. I still haven't even opened any of the packs or used any tickets that come with the game, saving those until I'm better.

All I'm saying is this game is easily the best card out right now. There's an infinite amount of really amazing and intense casual play to be had for free. You can hate that you can't play the whole game for 100% free, but there is no other card game that offers unlimited drafting for a one time price.
Deep and complex gameplay. Payment model minimizes the advantage of "whales", makes it much easier to  get the cards you want, and allows infinite drafting (included with purchase of game, no need to grind dailies just to get to draft). It's not on the hearthstone model, and that's a good thing.
Love this game. People/Games media were very worried about the economics of another card game, especially one by Valve using the steam market, but so far I've found it much cheaper than hearthstone or magic. To have a game without F2P crap like quests, the fear of falling behind economically and needing to "save gold for the next set"...  It's pretty great. If you need specific cards, just go get them. Open packs, sell off the rewards, play free draft mode forever if you want.

The game seems to have a lot of strategic depth so far, and my need to learn more is quite evident - lost a game by one HP last night, that stung. I look forward to where it can grow and I'm already imagining what the heroes not included from DotA yet are going to be.
Free rotating constructed mode, free community tournaments, free Gauntlet runs. Filling out the collection via pack opening is going to be expensive but Expert Constructed using your collection really isn't the focus of this title as of yet. Try the pre-constructed decks or try your hand at drafting. The polish and complexity of game mechanics make for a really rewarding experience.

Too much randomness and "Control deck" can't control anything.

First Impression is not good for a long time Magic and Dota player

11/29/2018

FIRST FOR FORMOST:

ECO IN ARTIFACT AND MTG WILL AND ALWASY WILL BE BETTER THAN HEARTHSTONE. Generally you would pay way less to build an idea deck than what you paid in Hearthstone.

Apparently I don't know that you could have more than one same hero in a deck, this certainly opened up to a lot of possibility. I'd say I am partically to be blamed by treat colors in this game similar to MTG, there are similarities between these two games, for example Blue in Artifact is the only color the has the ability of board wipe as well as card drawing, while Red has aggresive creatures and mediocre buffs and etc. Yet what makes Artifact unique is the position of your cards and handeling of your resources (which there are multiple types of resources, gold is especiallly an interesting one; you could gain gold by kill enemy creeps or heroes, and purchase randomized items, by which I mean general items like gain attack and speical items that you put into your deck during deck building, at the beginning of your turn.), in addition of making decisions on which ways or creatures to save or keep. It is certainly a unique, different card game compare to Hearthstone, MTG and Gwent, and to me thats not a bad thing.

I've seing a fair amount of complains on the eco model of this game. I feel that the price of the pack is okish, as I spent roughtly over 20$ ever week on MTG anyway, but thats just me. I haven't really read into news in regard of this game so I don't know if they are going to intruoduce rotations, or even different mods of playing (i.e. Mordern, Commander in MTG) thereofre things might be difefent in the future. If you don't like TCG in the first place, then you might have a hard time to get into this game, hopefully the unique machiques could drag your interests. 

I feel the game has potentials, just that their tutorial need some more works, and the premade decks, especially black and blue decks are not good at all (below 50% win rates when play against mono Red premade deck, I built my own black-blue deck and actually have a higher win rate). Based on my experiences from MTG: Arena, a solid premade deck would help many who doesn't want to pay for the game to grind through the early stages.
For the most part, I think the game is quite good. Has flavours of Netrunner, and I like the player interactions. At least on the surface, the game feels deep. Most games I've lost were because I made bad decisions, which feels pretty nice. The game gives you a lot of opportunity to outplay your opponent, which is neat.

For gameplay, one thing that it sorely needs is a mulligan option, so that I'm not saddled with a bunch of cards I can't play from the very beginning of the game. Auto pass and an option to up the pace of the game would be welcome too, because when I don't have anything to play/do, I'd like to not have to baby a button in the bottom right of the screen.

People are voicing their concerns about the monetization model, but I don't think it's all that bad. By my math it's one of the cheapest games to get into if you plan on acquiring a full collection, particularly because you can buy the cards directly, which at the moment is really cheap for most of them. Be aware that buying packs is essentially gambling, and decades of real life TCG has gotten this down to a science; when given the option, it's almost always cheaper to buy cards directly in the long run.

Importantly, FREE DRAFT is so gosh dang huge I can't emphasize it enough. FREE DRAFT is definitely worth $20, because limited environments in games tend to be quite exciting in their own way. For emphasis, being able to DRAFT FOR FREE adds a lot of play for people not willing to go beyond the sticker price. DRAFTING FOR FREE gives you the opportunity to mess with goofy combinations without having to pay money. DRAFTING FOR FREE lets you make card valuations so that you don't have to waste money on cards that are actually bad. If there was only one thing I could say about this game, the fact that you can FREELY DRAFT is why I'd tell you that this game is worth buying.

The game is real good, and I find it easy to recommend, but be sure to research this game before you buy! I would definitely say it's not for everyone, and that if you plan on playing constructed in any competitive manner, be prepared to spend a moderate amount of money getting one deck up and running, and more if you want multiple decks. If you didn't hear it above, you can DRAFT, and it's FOR FREE.

For what it's worth, I've played all manner of card games, TCG and LCG alike. Take that for what you will.
I did not have the time to play as much as I wanted yet, but so far the game is great. 
The graphics are nice, the Soundtrack is great, the Gameplay is fun, the Game is affordable. Seriously, it was clear from the Beginning that this would be a TCG, so it was clear from the beginning that there would be a marketplace option. To build a current Tier 1 deck you need to invest probably 20€ more if you have NO luck opening your packs. 

Also there is a casual play option for players who are so incredibly bad that they already wasted all their tickets because they thought they could go competitive without learning anything about this game in the first place. So it's not NEEDED to pay more money.

Btw the game warns you in the beginning that you wont be able to refund if you open your starter packs. Some people complaining actually cannot even read it seems like...


I wrote this review on the train, so yeah it's quite half hearted, I just wanted to do something against the unecessary bad Reviews...


Honestly hearthstone was no where near as good on release, it had vanilla cards and very conservative cards. At least players are able to buy individual cards from other PLAYERS. Too many reviews talking about how shady artifact is when in fact the REAL shady system of buying packs and unable to sell the random cards as well as an ILLUSION that if a player plays hearthstone long enough, eventually they will generate the gold to buy cards. Now thats shady. Artifact is not shady with its business whether it is right or wrong. Too many sheeps need to be informed.
OK I've initially did not recommend this game.

but now they've made some steps in the good direction with it which I appreciate. the rewards are still quite underwhelming and the pricing is still kindof horrible, but the game is good enough to spend some extra cash on specific cards - I would recommend this over packs.

so what the hell, take my trust and Recommendation, Valve.
Fantastic game.  Already have 90 hours into it.  Best card game on market.  I'd say 95% of people complaining are children.  Not a game to jump in and be good at after 1 hour of play.  Very high skill cieling.
Positives:
-- Game is very complex with a high skill cap, which also makes it fun to watch top players and to theorize about the game
-- Deckbuilding is rich with lots of options and variations
-- For the first time, draft is a serious mode that's well supported, and it's a lot of fun with a high amount of skill cap
-- First time in-game tournament are a feature in a card game, which makes it great to play with friends and for the competitive scene
-- Lots of ways to play the game to your own liking
-- Game is packed with more features than Gwent and HS combined 
-- UI is well crafted
-- Game has no repetitiveness at all. Can play for hours and hours on end
-- Has a lot of design space which makes for exciting prospects of future additions

Neutrals:
-- The game's economy is great if you come from an MtG background. When games like Hearthstone or Gwent have your money locked in, you lose everything when you decide to quit. The fact that you can cash out in Artifact is a great thing if I ever feel like the game is not for me anymore. This gives me confidence to spend all I want on the game.
The progression system is alright, but it could be better. At the moment, you have to play free gauntlets until you feel comfortable and then do competitive gauntlets and do well in them in order to go infinite. The system in place makes it not so hard to go infinite if you're a serious player, but the issue is that jumping from free gauntlet to paid gauntlet is such a big jump and one that requires investment that it's hard to justify doing that as a regular player and to know when to do it. At the same time, if you're a good player you can just go infinite and make money on the game at the same time. The benefit to this system is that cards wont tank in value with time as much, but at the same time, it makes it really unfriendly to the casual player which may hurt the numbers in the long run. For players like myself, it's a non issue, but I would like to see the game grow as much as possible as well. 
-- The RNG by default is not an issue. The game has such a high skill cap and the complexity is to the point where it's easy to blame RNG for your losses, but it rarely simply came down to getting bad RNG. Card effects like Cheating Death feel really bad when you lose to them, but at the same time they're necessary for certain situations. All of the RNG in the game feels alright since there's a lot of ways you can play around it, and it's all there to cause variance so that each game is very unique.
-- Some card art is great, but some card art is not so exceptional

Negatives:
-- As of right now, the game doesn't have a chat feature which it used to have, making interaction with other players a little hard, unless you use 3rd party stuff like Discord. There are times where I want to say gg, nice play, or something but I can't. I think if people don't want chat, they should just disable it in the game menus instead of taking it altogether, and I hope they reconsider adding chat back. It feels like I'm playing highly advanced bots instead of real players after queing for a game.
-- As of right now, there's no trading feature which I think really hampers the benefits of the economy system 
-- As of right now, there's no way to browse a list of tournaments in order to find them easily, you kind of have to find them word to mouth which makes it hard
So far, so good.  If you enjoy card games that make you think and use strategy, this one is for you.  If you love the Dota 2 world and lore, this one is for you.  I have only spent a total of about 2 hours which is nothing to get a firm grasp of all the concepts and meta, however, from what I have played, I have really enjoyed it.  In fact, its actually made me want to play Dota 2 more.  Not sure if that was the intent though.
From a MtG background this game is great. There are UI issues that, knowing Valve, will be addressed ad-hoc as the game evolves (e.g. the tutorial doesn't really say where debuffs on heroes/creeps are, and the UI doesn't really do a good job of showing positive/negative debuffs).  
Lore is heavy from DOTA, and it feels it. Not just blocks of text, but amazingly well acted voice lines in what feels like everything.
Deck designing is fun and evolves the more you see of the game and realize there isn't one 'right way' to play.  
Worth the price alone even if you don't plan on buying any more cards and want to stick to free/bot modes.  That said, the fact it's market enabled is going to make this game last.
So uh eventually everyone HAS to buy packs to stay on top for they have a gatcha component (computational randomizer), which is different from mechanical drop rates (i.e traditional physical card packs). For all we know rares, mythicals, artifact, arcanas, etc(possible new tier of rarity based on dota 2 rarity system) will have a 0.00010% drop rate.

People will say the market will be there where it's cheap and abundant. For now that is true. However, prices and quantity won't be there all the time for the recycle mechanic encourages players to basically gamble a deck they make and fight with 5 times. If they passed the trial, then they can gamble again for a super rare cards or meta cards, which is what all card 
players aim for. It's what keeps us going and get invested in the game which is good thing. 

The bad thing is and the main argument that everyone seems to be trying to make is the drop rate system. If you fail the trial you have go back to the card pack slot machine and lose the ticket and packs. If you past the trial you still go back to the slot machine and you get more tries at it. And remember these trials you are always facing a real person, so someone is always losing somewhere that's the other thing. On average you are going to lose in expert mode => buy more tickets and packs to play. As you can see, the cycle just continues. Why would any card collector, any pro, any casual wants to stay in the meta,  ANY PERSON would sell on a market where you make a little gain when you can recycle for a chance to get a rare sk-I mean card? Edit:(12/20/2018) Value now can change the values of these cards and there is a less incentive to sell them from now on.

Based on the principle of supply and demand the market won't have enough cards and they won't be affordable eventually. That's why it's a bad system if this is the only system to rely on. I don't see any store IRL that recycles my cards for new fresh packs. Based on that fact you can tell you're going to play the long con.

Basically TLDR; it's lot of money down the road because it's gambling still. Keep in mind you don't own any of this, none of this was really yours. 

Other than that this game is pretty cool to play.

Edited(12/3/2018) : google "The Untold History of EA's Long (and Rich) Pay-2-Win Love Affair" for more infomation why this is a dangerous road for Artifact.

Edited(12/20/2018): As of today, they can balance change cards. Meaning they can buff underrated cards and nerf meta cards. Value controls the market. Meaning that you have no control over the value of the cards. Again nothing like MTG for it's gaming as a service. Remember you don't own any of this, none of this was really yours.
This is the best card game I've ever played. Having a great time, THERE IS VOICE ACTED LORE! Card effects are more varied and interesting than hearthstone, but you do not have to navigate through the maze of phases and stacks that is Magic. Card prices seems to have dropped enormously, and with a free draft mode you don't really need to buy cards to try out different decks! I bought a copy for my best friend as well (I forgot his birthday I suck a lot...) and both of us have enjoyed our purchases. Big Dota fan so excited to dip my feet into the free Dota plus as well. Cheers yal <3
For what it is on launch it has high potential. As a casual fun game, I'd probably wouldn't recommend it, but as a competitive tournament game, sure 100%

Don't expect crazy goofy missions and expirience points. Expect close games and insanely great card mechanics!

Also: Loving the animations, voice lines & overall polish. Don't see too many downsides for business model, I believe it'll work in the longrun for dedicated players.

Not planning to spend anything else than base game purchase, I'll come back in a month to rereview the game!
The Market is Cheap/The Game is Fun/Can Play All Game modes Free/Can Spend a Buck to Try for Prizes if You Play well/Only 3 levels of rarity ensuring plenty of every card on the market for a reasonable price.

 I am personally glad valve didn't go for the FtP carrot on the stick model and instead created the open market and I hope for years of enjoyment to come. They went for much more of a sandbox feel. Play the game how you want with whom you want.
An excellent card game designed by valve. Most negative reviews about this game complain about monetization, but this game is vastly cheaper than most card games. There are modes that you can play without needing any cards such as phantom draft and call to arms. The only reason you would need to spend any money on this game beyond the initial 20 bucks is if you want to play constructed and build your own decks which is pretty fun but I enjoy phantom draft more. Even if you do want to play constructed there are plenty of decks that are really cheap to create that are good. The game only starts costing a lot of money if you want to play the top tier constructed decks with the powerful costly rare cards and even then the cost is way better than other games it competes with such as hearthstone because of the market system. I actually made a little money playing phantom draft and selling some of my cards enough where I completely got all my money back from purchasing artifact and a little extra. Don't buy it thinking you will probably get all your money back though because the cards were worth a lot more at launch then they are now but I am just saying that if you sell your cards the cost is less than $20.

Gameplay ways Artifact is pretty fun and strategic. Every game you play whether you win or lose there's always something you could have done better. Sometimes the game needs you to think several moves ahead in order to outplay your opponent. Even though I love the game and enjoy playing it unlike after an intense game lots of times you won't feel like queing up another game because you just need to give your brain a rest. It's not a game to really binge play constantly but play a few matches when you feel like it. Valve intentionally tried to make the game non-addictive to try to counteract the videogame culture we live in nowadays where all games whether PC, console, or especially mobile try to make their games extremely addictive by doing things like rewarding you every time you log in and making playing a long time give you fake prizes. Too many games these days make playing feel like a chore sometimes to give fake prizes. The only reason to play Artifact is to enjoy it not to have to farm cards which I really love.

The amount of work they put into the game is obvious especially when it comes to voicelines is obvious. Every one of the 200+ cards has long voicelines which is abosolutely insane. It must have taken them forever to give every single card custom audio. It makes me kind of sad to see how hard they worked on the game and to try to improve the problems most card games have these days just for it to be so negatively recieved. 

While I have many good things to say about the game it is not perfect, there is frequently a lot of RNG involved with a lot of games and if you do want to play the highest level of constructed it is expensive as I stated earlier. 

Overall, I highly recommend the game especially to those who enjoy strategic card games.
Let me just address the elephant in the room. It's a Card Game: What that means are some very important things.
     1: This game will require some monetary investment to construct decks. This is not unusual in any sense for card games, as a veteran Magic: The Gathering player, let me state that this is perfectly enjoyable casually without more than the initial investment. You can sell your cards and time will tell if the monetary value holds. Don't be discouraged by spending money on cards. It's definitely Pay to Compete. But not pay to win. This game is fully enjoyable with minimal investment.
    2: Mechanics and UI and the game client are superb. Very complex gameplay with a relatively low skill floor. Very enjoyable and definitely fun to play.
    3: Keep an open mind and remember, it is a card game (with all that being so entails).

In conclusion, the game is worth a shot and I have found my time so far enjoyable. I forsee plenty of hours to come playing it. Well done Valve
A company gets to pick ONE of these options per game they develop:

1. An online market for cards
2. A way to get cards for free

If you have both, then cards BECOME essentially devoid of value. For all of you guys complaining about the price of this game...Artifact is a generous online TCG that chose the first option as their monetization policy. This means that you CANNOT get cards for free, BUT you can buy pretty much any common card for pennies on the market. You do have to pay to play ranked, but only if you lose more than 50% of your games. This cost is offset by the rewards for winning more than 50% of you games, which comes out to more than the price of the tickets. Basically, if you win more than 50% of your games, you end up with a net positive value in the end. You might not like the monitization policy of this game, but I it isn't really that bad when you do the math.
The game is great :) People disappointed with the payment model are free to their opinion. My thoughts are that such folk have forgotten what a 'Trading Card Game' actually is. It's understandable that people will compare this game to Hearthstone. I love both games. However I'm getting the immediate sense that to compare HS and Artifact is to compare pillow fighting with professional boxing.

If you're looking for an all-consuming card game that brings back childhood memories of saving your pocket money to buy the latest pack of Pokemon cards, this game hits the spot so far imo. My only words of warning would be that the average game length is easily 40min+.
If you're after a lightweight, fluffy, casual experience with 5-10minute games, stick to Hearthstone 100%!
I understand everyones strife with how to obtain new cards, but think of it like this. Take Magic the Gathering, I'm sure most of you will agree that new players will MOST LIKELY buy a pre-built deck from the store. That goes for $15-20, what is the price of this game? $20, moving on. If you want to be a "good" MTG player, you're gonna need to invest A LOT of big bucks into it, a competitive deck has costed me around $150 to even up to $300 (Would have been more expensive if i didn't pull a $50 card that I needed). You have to individually buy each card or get lucky in packs that you buy. That's EXACTLY what this game is doing, and no surprise either, since Valve is behind the project and the creator of MTG made the game. So am I upset that Valve decided to do this? Absolutely not, I'd be a hypocrite if I did since I'm also a MTG player. Plus if you're good at this game, you can technically get free packs by doing the Phantom Draft (which I have done one, and went 4-2). Overall, I think this game could be one of the BEST card games to date, mechanically and visually.
I have to admit I was skeptical at first and did not like the economic model, but by introducing the free draft and constructed Valve already made a huge step in the right direction. Yes, despite what you hear and read everywhere it is possible to play Artifact without paying a single Dollar, by making free drafts that are the best mode to learn the mechanics and understand if ever you will want to invest more money to go for constructed. You buy the game for 20 $ and you receive 10 packs + 5 tickets which combined are worth more than the initial investment, so technically speaking the game is "free".

Talking about the game, what to say, it is simply amazing. Deep, complex, strategic, rewarding, it is a masterpiece of strategy and thinking and whenever you emerge victorious from a game you feel really you bested your opponent. There are RNG elements but the more you play the more you will realize they are secondary and if you are a good player you can always play around them. Some effect like Cheating Death may still be problematic but I am sure they will addressed soon, and anyway they are limited to very few cases.

TL:DR -> Game is amazing, if you love cardgames that reward skill, planning and strategy you must absolutely try it out. You will love it!
went into it pessimistic and a little peaved that the game didnt look esports-friendly.

extremely surprised that i enjoy it! its not over complicated and is intensely enjoyable. not sure how it will go as an esport, but i see this as a polished card game that attracted me, a non card game player.
Mechanically interesting and, fun game. I do agree with the critiques on game length however, but I suppose that's down to play style. 

You don't need to spend a fortune to get a decent deck in this game, despite what people who clearly don't know anything about the game have said. The game gives you 10 card packs and a couple starter decks. Each card pack contains at least one rare, and typically you can sell all your cards from these packs (mainly the rares) for like $10-$20 USD total on the Steam Market. Effectively allowing you to buy cards that you want for a deck of your style. Even then you can get a decent deck for less than $5USD, probably less. 

Comparing to Hearthstone where it takes ages of playing to get enough dust or RNG froms packs to get a decent deck to actually play the game properly, Artifact effectively gives you (in Hearthstone Terms) almost all greys and blues and then like 6500 dust on average to build your first decks. Considering time cost and monetary cost, Artifact is far cheaper in terms of actually being able to get a decent deck to play against other people. 

For those who have bought the game but not received the entry packs/tickets, just wait. Took a few hours before my items came through, but you DO get them.
Amogst all the negative reviews about motization I woud like to point out that there are two main game modes in Artifact:
a) Draft, which you can play for free, forever. Thats pretty amazing you can play a completely fair mode THAT IS THE INTENDED COMPETIVE MODE THAT THE GAME IS BALANCED AROUND that requires no collection or progresion outside of the mode right off the bat forever. No packs no tickets no nothing.
b) Constructed, I don't understand how people expected a deck building card game mode without a pay to win component, card games are inheritnly pay to win what were you expecting for them to give you all the cards on download?

Bonus: All the negative reviews seem to be from people who have under 5hours in the game :thinking:

P.S It's also just a great game regardless of what you think of monitization.
Starter items still missing 90 mins after launch, server just crushed with only 50k players, srsly?

Maybe next time you release a online game, run a actul "open" beta
A suprisingly deep and fun card game. Some sort of daily login bonus or small free gifts or cards would offset the large outcry over the big selection of microtransactions for packs and cards though. Honestly, compared to real life tcg, the prices are not that bad, but still...
It's a well designed game with amazing depth and polish. I think Reynad said it best when Artifact was designed in mind for card game enthusiasts. People who love this game will really love it. People who aren't attracted by Artifact will most likely feel a strong dislike for it.
Staying in the tutorial match for 20 mins, have some knowledge of the game, que for my first match. took like a min to find a match, then win, best game 9/10. good job valve.
Got 0 packs when i started. supposedly you're meant to get 10 or something :thinkingface:. gameplay is pretty cool tho.

Volvo pls fix

VOLVO FIXED IT!! WHAT MADLADS! :melon:
Artifact is the best game in the genre. Unironically. Valve have created a gripping, addictive game that, unlike anything else in the genre, can truly, truly leave you on the edge of your seat. Ignore the memes - this actually is something special.

And by the way, I would rather have a game that's actually ♥♥♥♥ing honest with me about what it will take to a build a deck, with generally really cheap cards on the market (look at everything that isn't the top three Rare heroes) then something like Hearthstone that explicitly lies to me about what it thinks I'll be "capable of doing" for free.
Great game!

P.S. Community please open your eyes!

I highly recommend reading official information about the game, not the negative hype reviews.

A lot in this game is free and you will mostly play free game mods.

The gamodes that are pay-to-play are Expert game mods and they are for pro-gamers, who seek challenge and reward and thus it's totally fine.

Also if you are looking to earn some easy money (like from PUBG), this game isn't for you unless you are a very good player
Artifact is the most fun I've ever had playing a card game. Is beautifully complicated and interesting. Despite all the community complaints it's actually one of the cheapest cards games out there. And the draft mode is free to play for those that don't want to spend 100 dollars making a competive constructed deck.
Unlike other Valve games (or games in general), the Artifact devs actually listened to the community feedback.

We wanted balance? We got it.
We wanted a progression system? We got it.
We wanted free card packs? We got 'em (sort of).

Valve did a great job on addressing the stuff Artifact was lacking (especially because when it was released it felt like still in Early Access) and that within just a few weeks.
If you were on the fence before, the last two updates solved the game's biggest problems, the updates gave us opportunity to grind card packs without completely destroying the market system (the cards still have their value), they gave us rankeds (progression) and maybe the most important one is that they changed their minds about balancing cards, they were doing it on a physical tcg approach (that you balance it out with expansions) and now they adopted the digital approach (just patch it). 
its a pretty good game, with a fresh three lane concept, and a "one play at a time" round system that is very interesting, the RNG is there, sometimes you may lose because of it, sometimes you win, the important thing is that it keeps every match unique.

TD;DR 
It was ok before, its pretty good now.
One of the best card games I've played the way the market is set up is to mimic real life card sales. I really enjoy it. Its a game I will definetly invest a lot of my time into.
Game is pretty much a card turn base game. To be honest, I enjoy the game mechanics as it's rather unique and deep. I think most of us will agree on this.

If you do enjoy card games like Magic and Hearthstone, this game probably will be to your liking since it requires an even higher level of thinking and strategy. It's pretty much a mixture of both.

However as seen from reviews after reviews, the microtransaction is a huge issue. Players can buy the game, open the packs and sell them immediately to gain profit. The shady business model is just unacceptable and ridiculous. This makes me "turn-off" in a way.

Not only that, the game lacks ranking system. I don't see any leaderboard, rank or game statistics such as number of wins and losses. No levels or replay system. No interaction with any other players at all.


But I will still recommend this game because I enjoyed it.
This is a very fun game—without the need to spend additional money. I’ve never played a card game like this before, and am honestly surprised by how much I enjoy the gameplay. Very fun and exciting. 

People who are complaining about cost aren’t exactly right. While there is an opportunity for P2W through constructed decks, there are game modes within Artifact that allow for competitive and level gameplay regardless of how much money you’ve spent. I love playing Phantom Draft which is always free and extremely exciting. 
Looking forward to seeing more. 

Incredibly fun and deep card game with fair pricing model. This is a TCG, not a CCG. I know the masses are spoiled on free models with currency grinds but your cards are trade-able in this game. Not only that, it costs literal pennies to acquire 95% of the collection. Are we that cheap? I remember re-buying $60 games over and over just because I lost the CD in the past.

Then there is all the free modes...infinite casual phantom drafts is unreal. You can also get some friends together and do an in-house draft with tournament mode FOR FREE. No other card game offers that. Try to look past the band-wagon negative reviews and look at this for what it is, a great game.
In it's current state (1 set released, high monetization model) I would probably recommend just playing around in draft mode unless you are going to want to compete, then obviously getting the cards for a "tier 1" constructed deck is going to be necessary.

Looking at other reviews, there's a lot of idiots getting artifact who don't understand what a CTCG is. Let me break it down, it's a collectible TRADING card game,  so when you open a pack, you're getting something worth something. So when you see steam reviews of people complaining that they can't refund because they already opened a pack of cards, it should be a big "well no sheet sherlock" moment because you're essentially opening a booster pack like in yugioh/pokemon/MTG. Imagine bringing an opened booster pack back to the store you bought it at and asked for a refund, you would get declined. Also people would abuse the living hell out of the refund policy if you could return your opened packs in order to try to fish for the most expensive cards, which would kill the player-market-economy nature of the game. 

Now as for the game itself, I like it, it's a longer card game with a good amount of depth that feels rather fair outside of the obvious: there's going to be "best" cards in a set. So if you don't get lucky opening packs to get the strong cards, or if you don't buy them from another player, you're generally going to be behind in the constructed scene. However this is nothing new to any CTCG player, as when some cards are just better than others, the price will show. 

My biggest concern however is how Valve is going to handle balancing cards due to the fact that these cards have monetary value. Most CTCGs just limit/ban the usage of overpowered cards, which although affect the price, won't necessarily kill the card value because it's no longer useful. Time will tell how Valve addresses this.
Personally, I love the game. Everyone is going on complaining about how the cards cost money, and its such a huge money... but the best way to play the game is phantom draft mode, which gives access to all the cards for free. Sure if you wanna have a chance to earn rewards you have to put in money, but that's only logical, as these are cards that have actual value. Granted, the majority of the cards are worth between 1-25 cents, so you're not getting a ton of value out of the cards, but that makes it even more confusing why people are complaining. Besides the top like 5 cards rn, you can porbably buy every card in the game with an investment of around $20-30. Like I said before though, that's completely unnecessary since you can just do draft mode and have no entry cost whatsoever. Honestly, people just need something to complain about everytime something new comes out.
It's hard to newman, i love this game and play it with friends. It costs long time to play. But you can be happy when you win. You can try to play artifact. I hope artifact will be better. Join us!
As someone that hates grinding for cards in "Free to Play" games. I'm a huge fan of the monetization system in the game. Being able to purchase whatever card you want without having to open packs until you get it really intrigued me to start playing. No more having to spend hundreds of dollars on the newest Duel Links set and still not get what you want.
The core gameplay is fantastic. I have never seen a card game with this much outplay potential. 

RNG:
Normally I really really really hate RNG. Apart from that Cheating Death card (has been reworked now) every single RNG aspect of this game is justified and managable. It is what studies call "good RNG". In fact this is the most skillful card game I have ever played.

Economy:
As a hearthstone arena veteran (I could go 7+ almost every time) I freaking love the no-grind aspect of Artifact. Your time is more valuable than the initial cents you pay (if you are good enough, you can gain it & more back). If you only care about gauntlet (arena) you can just sell / recycle the cards you earn to make going infinite, easier.

edit: there are free packs & tickets to get as you level up your in-game account now.
edit2: there are skill rankings now
edit3: there is a chat function now

editfinal: game just keeps getting better and better
Artifact is no more pay to win than any physical trading card game has ever been. In fact, you get far more value than playing any physical TCG's. Beyond the initial purchase price, there is no need to spend money ever again and play competitively in much of the games varied modes.

Constructed decks, what pay to win is referring to, are a very minor part of the game and in any TCG where cards can be traded between players will remain “pay to win” as long as individuals are willing to shell out hundreds, and in some TCGs thousands of dollars to build gimmick decks design to be nearly undefeatable.

Casual Drafts and Preconstructed Gauntlet (themed events) offer unlimited replay and are where true “skill” and knowledge of the overall card system come into play. In order to do well in drafts, you must do more than just swiping a credit card to build a gimmick deck.

Like what I see so far... the most strategic card game I've ever played. 

Just need to find more time to really dive into it.

Oh, day 1 Linux support. Good work as always valve

Edit: Ok, I have spent a bit of time in the game now and want to offer some more thoughts

- I haven't spent any further money than my initial $19.99 outlay
- I am getting flogged in the gauntlet at the moment, but I am still interested in playing to see if I get better or if I am just plain bad
- I haven't started playing draft yet, so I have no idea if my deck-building skills will be put to good use
- the music in this game is catchy as hell
- the voice work in this game is insanely comprehensive and high quality
- the graphics and the UI are great (Vulkan powered!)
- I am not sure if I would like an unlock or progression system, but the prevailing wisdom seems to suggest that will disrupt the economy, so... maybe not?

Anyway, I paid for a game, I can play this game single player or find a game against a person easily enough, and I am still having fun. Make of that what you will.
As of the point in time I am writing this (November 29, 00:27), the game just got released and I just got to play it for two hours. But it is a great game. I followed the games development for a long time before it was realesed and I am very happy how it turned out.

Don't let others destroy the expierence for you by mocking the game because of it's "bad monetazation scheme". The market is very new, so the prices still have to adjust themselves. And even now, Artifact is still the cheapest DCG. And even if you don't want to spend any money, there is still the phatom draft mode, which is a lot of fun.

Another thing that I want to mention about this game is the soundtrack. Surprisingly, it is amazing. And not only that, the whole style of the game is really nice. I had really liked the style of Blizzard's Hearthstone and had the fear that Artifact can't keep up with it's great style. But turns out, they really nailed it with their stylistic choices!

The only "problem" with the game right now, is that there is no progression and no real competetive ladder. But Valve already announced that this is the first thing they are going to work on after the release.

By the way, the problem that people are not receiving their 10 free card packs and 5 event tickets is probably just a temporary server issue/bug. I myself didn't have any problems with the starting stuff.

If there is anything else about the game comes to my mind, I might update the review at some point
The game is super fun and 1/4 the price to play competively compared to any other online card game.

It of course irks me that there isn't a way to earn cards (entirely) from nothing, but such an ability would depreciate the value of cards.

This issue is discounted by the fact that you require around 30 dollars total to be competitive in this game, and you have the option of selling out. That, plus the game being good is more than enough for me. The more present issue will be whether this setup is enough for people to keep coming back to the game despite it offering no constant incentives aside from good gameplay. Which if it doesn't, will force valve to pivot anyways.
This game is very good. People who complain are salty that the business model isn't as terrible as blizzards. Opening packs in Hearthstone is a scam, and you can't craft the cards you want without destroying cards that you already have for half value. If you have extra cards in Artifact, you can sell them for face value and buy the cards you actually want without losing money.
Deep, interesting, beautiful game. A lot more to play, but so far really impressed by it. Lacking a grind is a welcome change as well. Unlimited free draft is an incredible value.

love the game, very deep, so much decisions to do every turn.. takes time to understand, keep track of various aspects, and advance the game. I come from MTG and right now this is soo much better. still wont give up on modern in MTG, but this is now my primary game by far
I like it. Very in depth card game. Phantom Draft is a super fun mode and executed well here. I can see it getting expensive over time, but the market should allow you to get what you want for a decent price after its clams down a bit.
You get good value for money when you first buy the game with more than enough content to last you a good 10 hours of gameplay.

Draft mode is free in this game so if you enjoy drafting then you will enjoy this game.

Cards are a lot cheaper and being able to pick and choose what cards you want to buy helps out a lot.
Positives:

This game is very complex, and I'm speaking as a person who's played two hour, five person games of EDH in Magic regularly. It's not that the individual cards are terribly difficult to understand, but that there are so many little decisions to make at every point during a single round that can swing the game in your favor. If you've played many card games, Artifact will feel familiar but also novel enough to be worth playing compared to other games.

Unlimited, free phantom drafts are amazing. There's no other card game I know of that does this, and it makes the game so much more replayable after constructed inevitably loses its luster before each next set.

Compared to other CCGs/TCGs, the monetization model is far more consumer friendly. The $20 buy-in can be mitigated by just selling whatever cards you pull from your included 10 packs, and you're left with unlimited drafts (which I've found are the best part of most card games) and preconstructed gauntlets. 
Even then, if you want to build a good constructed deck, you're not limited to cracking packs to get the cards you need, which is already an edge up on Hearthstone and MTGA and friends. Singles prices are currently, even just one day after launch, already way more reasonable than any other card game with a secondary market that I've played. Packs are better value as well.

Oh yeah the game itself is pretty fun all around I guess. Overall really engaging. There's pretty much no downtime in a match and that's a positive IMO.


Negatives:

A distinct lack of trading for no apparent reason on launch. My guess is it would lead to 3rd party trading sites which would have some complex impact on the community market's economy, but really, I'd hoped this would've been solved by launch.

A lack of a progression system of any kind. I mean, right now I like the game enough for what it is just to play it for fun, but building towards *something* would be appreciated. Just slap random cosmetic rewards into the game already and be done with it. It won't impact the actual card economy that y'all seem really intent on controlling.

A little buggy. Sometimes cards in the collection will overlap each other making everything unreadable. Sometimes the imps' transitions between animations are jumpy. Not too much of a big deal, but this was in closed beta for a while.

Obviously this will be resolved as more sets come out, but the card pool is pretty limited right now. Speaking of limited, Sealed would be nice to see in the future.

I'm personally not a fan of the improvement that gives units a 50% chance to survive lethal damage with 1 health left. I'm okay with RNG in moderation, but that's just way too swingy to be fun.

You can't pat the imps on the head.

Not a criticism of the game itself, but holy hell the advertising for Artifact has been abysmal. The first public tournament stream was a disaster, there's been pretty much no traditional advertisements anywhere online, and I don't know of any streamers that have been sponsored. Valve, I know you have the capital to do these things right. You got away with CS:GO being blegh for its first year and then built it up into what it is now with word of mouth ferrying it along to eventual success, but c'mon. The game itself is good, it's fun, and I think it's worth playing, so maybe do it some justice?


I still think Artifact is worth playing. But, like many multiplayer Valve games at launch, it's had a rocky start and needs a lot of work. I would still recommend it, but I certainly understand a lot of the ire it's drawn.
I've been enjoying the game so far. I've played enough TCG such as Pokemon, Hearthstone, Yu-gi-oh and the very recent GWENT (Witcher card game). My first impressions is that Artifact is very polished, high quality and refreshing. I know people are bashing its monetizing model, lets put that aside for now. 

Now the game itself feels like Hearthstone in many ways as are most generic TCG available these days. Obviously Hearthstone being a massive success, many other card games would borrow its concept. But Artifact adds its own twist, it has 3 lanes/ boards. A very unique winning condition, either by taking out 2 towers or focus down the ancient. Those who played Dota 2 might be able to relate! I played thousands of hours of Dota 2 back in the days. Valve converted the MOBA into a card game which is pretty sick. The fact that they kept the Heroes skills and personalities from Dota 2 and made it into Artifact gives me nostalgia, I love it!

One of the interesting mechanics that I like the most is the priority. where you get to initiate first or second. To me this is very fun and strategic, where you could bait your opponent and then counter them once they have expanded their mana. Or to strike first before they could play any cards thus render thier turn useless. While the cards itself feels very Hearthstone like, mechanics such as priority and phases resemblance Yu-gi-oh much. It has been a while since I played a TCG with such complexity. Now when I say Artifact is a complex TCG, please do not be discouraged. Yes, it is more complex than Hearthstone but less complex than Yu-gi-oh IMO. And the tutorial did a decent job of explaining ALMOST everything you need to know. 

Now the monetizing model.... it is not F2P, it has no grind, it can be placed on the market place. I reckoned is okay.... at least these cards have some value?? Unlike Hearthstone which I spent like over $800 but now it is just sitting there since I'm no longer playing. And trust me, Artifact is easier to get the cards you want compare to other TCG. I like the Keeper draft where I could pick the cards I want (sniping for rares). You can straight up buy the cards that you want in the market place, you'd be surprise the cards are relatively cheap compare to other TCGs. 

But if you don't want to spend much, there is always Phantom Draft which is the mode I like the most. You get to play cards that you do not own, so I'd say you don't even need to have a full collection. I would just do Phatom draft all day, I just want to have fun. 

I think most veteran TCG players would like this game. 

I’ve played the game for a little over a week now and I’m really enjoying the experience.  Free phantom drafts taught me the game, and I’m starting to win packs with the expert phantom draft.
I enjoy this game, drafting is fun and free. Their is room for it to grow as more sets are released. Some features and a progress would be nice to have. Overall really like it.
Have played card games for 20 years and Artifact is the best by a massive margin. The game is deep and balanced, rewards skill, and is a ton of fun. The graphics being great enhance the fun factor even further and the cost for cards is the best in the entire industry. I am excited to see Artifact thrive.
I was intending to play this game as I am a fan of dota, CCG's and poker and this is a wonderful mix of all three. 

I was surprised to learn I got this game for free for preordering steam controller, which I am glad for as I was apprehensive to buy after learning that this game has no free 2 play mode like heartstone.

I have only played 6 hours, losing many games but still really enjoying myself. Everytime I play I learn some new awesome mechanic and am continually impressed with this as a whole. Valve are a top developer and it really shows in their games.

Overall I recommend this if you like strategy games, ccgs and dota. My only hang up is the lack of free card packs, maybe they will give us events or something to earn. 


A cautious recommendation. Mechanically, Artifact is fantastic, and in many ways a breath of fresh air. However, if you want to play without spending more than the entry fee, you better enjoy phantom draft mode or the occassional preconstructed event (assuming they follow up Call to Arms with other events in the future.)
Game is great value, buying cards off of the marketplace will be much more efficient regarding time and money spent. People saying the game is pay to play obviously don't understand the economics of the game. 

-Draft is free and you can play that as much as you want FOR FREE and it REQUIRES NO CARDS. 

-Some people claim not getting anything on launch which is due to lag, resulting in a small delay in receiving your packs.

-Also the 10 pack you receive on launch plus the 5 tickets is already worth more than the price you paid for the game. So basically the game is actully free. What you pay for is the packs and the tickets. So you could even sell all the cards you got, if you're lucky get your 18€ (or whatever) back and pay draft basically as a F2P game

-Also also you get a month free of dota+ if that's something that interests you.

As a fan of card games, I have to say that Artifact is by far the most unique of card games I've played. It's like having three matches at once (Idk if I'm the only one feeling it at first). And for the record, it's not entirely 'pay to win' like what some people would say.

I mean, you could beat an Axe + Drow deck with a Phantom Assassin or Bristleback. Bottom line is, like any other strategy card games:

Think.

Bottom line, I'm hooked.
Most negative reviews are due to this game's monetization model, so some items of defense for you:

-Has a free, no-rewards, draft mode you can play infinitely. This gives you a draft mode where money can't help you win and you don't have to spend money to play.

-Has a free gaunlet mode where you pick one of several preconstructed decks and play against others running the same pool of decks. You can play this infinitely and the decks ocassionally rotate. Like draft, this gives you a constructed mode where money can't win and you don't have to spend money to play.

-Despite having no F2P model, costs less currently to be competitive than other card games, aided tremendously by the fact that you can buy individual cards, the vast majority of which cost literal pennies. No gambling on packs or lootboxes. Oftentimes, you can build the deck you want for a few dollars.

-The presence of the market sadly removed the capability to even reasonably add an F2P, but playing the market is a game in and of itself to some.

___

So yes, there are positives about this game's price model. There's game modes for virtually every format that are infinitely repeatable, free, and not aided by money... and even if you DO want to spend money, it's fairly priced. No, there is not a F2P and in order to keep the market in-tact, I don't think there ever will be.

The game itself is one of the most in-depth and fun card games I've ever played and matches the DotA flavor. I have a few gripes with how random the early turns can feel (losing a hero uncontrollably on turn 1 is not an uncommon occurence, especially in draft modes, I find), but the balance is still there overall.
Well so far...
Game runs beautifully especially with some higher off resolutions: No really bad glitches 
Beautiful design and transitions between phases
Free to play drafts 
All the decks so far that I've tried are fun to use 
Some heroes can be better balanced.
Would like to have some sort of communication while playing like chat or somethin

This game does have a high learning curve, but since I've been playing TCG's forever. This wasn't tooo hard to pick up after a couple of runs. Reminds me of Hearthstone and Magic The Gathering in one. The decks are really fun and can't wait for the next ones. Each game to their own. If you don't want to spend you can just play draft. If you are lucky to get some good card sell it and probably make a few decks from it lol.
This game is not without it's flaws. But before you are turned off by the "pay2win omg" squad. Find someone who has spent time with the game and can discuss that. I will also dissect why comparing this to a current "free to play" economic model is wrong.

The game is unlike anything else out there.

The depth and possibilities within each match are genuinely staggering, the gameplay is rewarding and the production value is so far above any current online card game (hearthstone, elder scrolls legends, magic the gathering etc)

Mechanically, this game is just incredible. The pedigree of the game designers is put on display immediately, and you realise you are constantly making strategical decisions. This is in contrast to simpler ccg games like hearthstone where you are often waiting to implement one of two "win conditions" that a meta deck will have. i.e. (warrior rage combo etc).

Addressing the economic model of the game:

It works differently to hearthstone, Magic and Elder scrolls. These games seem generous, but if you actually desire to play at a competetive level, the investment is in the hundreds (i have played 2 of these for hundreds of hours at a cost of hundreds of pounds). They just disguise it very well with micro-transactions.

This game has an actual card marketplace! The main difference between spending money on packs in artifact, is they retain value! I am not stuck trading my cards for a secondary resource that i can then turn into the card i actually want but at return of 10% or less, I can trade with a real person for nearly the full original value.

My only current criticism of the game is it lacks some of the reward mechanisms that I have become accustomed to. I am so used to unlocking small tokens and having a bit of a grind, that I miss it and hope that when ranks and cosmetics are added it will provide me with that
I have to be honest, I bought the game and got my money back thanks to the rare hero cards in my pack. The base game is kinda expensive? Yeah, I could agree especially if you're casual player like me. 
However, due to the rare hero drops I managed to earn more than what I bought. Which brings me to play without these 'imba' hero cards on the market. Who cares about those cards, I'm playing casually, trying to build a strong deck with cheap cards combo wombo my pals. I think, that's where the fun comes. Being creative and build something out of nothing.

And basically Im saying is, this base game is 'considered' free to me after deducting the cost and everything. Not to mention, you gain more than you spent. Back to Dota 2 with an extension of 1 month Dota . Grab the profit bois
Gameplay is super fun. Even without owning the cards, just having the base game will give you access to a lot of features in the game. You can play every mode offered in the game, the only thing you would be missing are the rewards we get under "expert play". The preconstructed gaunlets are fun, i find myself easily losing hours at a time on this game. It's got a learning curve but nothing overly complicated to spoil the fun. There's a couple of rng elements but the presence of three lanes on the board sometimes negates those rng effects. Ultimately the game is definetly worth the money.
(12/21/2018) Valve just proved, once again, that they have some intelligent people shot calling back there. Instead of pretending like this was purely a physical card game they saw the light and realized they should leverage one of the major benefits of having a digital card game, the ability to balance cards post-release. 

They've just added in progression and in literally 3 games (wins) over the last 60 minutes, I've gotten 2 packs and 2 tickets, for free. That's $6 for free. 

My only complaints now have to do with some Quality of Life improvements and I have renewed faith in Valve that they'll identify and fix those issues in short order. (timeout/roping-out needs to be revisited)
I think the monetization model is good... Sure paying almost 20 euros for a card game sounds offputting because you can play so many others for free, but after you bought the game you can play it for free. And I believe some of those who are complaining didn't actually read how this works before buying the game. silly people...

All of the game modes have "free to play" versions aswell (as long as you bought the game)... If you want to play this competitively, you may need to pay some money or so atleast if you cant win 3 or more battles out of 5 to get the reward tickets. Other games you can play for "free", but you enter rng hell where you might have to spend a lot of money after you get the right cards you need for your deck. Here you can buy those cards required for real competitive play relatively cheap compared other games. This game might not be for everyone, but it is a good game.
I have been playing card games for near 25 years, starting the early days of magic. This game has a level of depth to it that I have not experienced really since Jyhad/Vampire:TES. The gameplay is more like a strategic board game with cards in it. Totally loving it and hooked. With the recent updates, it shows a level of commitment by Valve to make this an excellent game and I feel there is a bright future ahead for it.
My first ever card game. Pretty impressive mechanics I would say. I was really hyped for this game before it's realease. Spent a decent amount of time understanding the game and when the game was released, I didn't hesitate to buy it.

However, I think more effort should be spent on the monetization of the game. Constructed mode is no doubt pay to win. You already paid 20 dollars and yet you also have to pay another 1 dollar for prize plays. This method of monetization is dated and it is the main reason why players are discouraged to play the game. Ya sure, community wants some skill progression and thank goodness it was introduced recently. But thats not enough. I restrict myself only to casual phantom draft since imo is the most fair and I don't have to burn my wallet. 

Based on the player activity, this game is dying and I'm disappointed. I remember from the beginning, the day the game was released, I couldn't even cancel searching a gauntlet match. Now it takes at least 15-30 seconds to find a match. As for Call to Arms event, I can't even search an opponent within 1 minute. 

I wouldn't recommend this game for those who hasn't earn money yet. The game itself is complex and buying this game without knowing how it works really sucks. Therefore, I strongly discourage students to play this game.

Despite giving paragraphs of negative comments, I love this game very much as it encourages me to think ahead everytime I make a move. I highly recommend this game to scholars and geniuses as well as those who like logical/math games. My advice is research and understand this game before buying it.

Thanks for reading.
As a veteran TCG player, who has played many TCGs over the past ~20 years, this is one of the best TCG's I have ever played. The design and mechanics of the game make one of the most skill rewarding TCG's on the market. It's crazy how often a match will become a nailbiting scenario where one mistake made by either player can lead to a loss. Also, though the game has a lot of RNG built in, I believe very little games are ever decided purely by RNG alone. I have played some 40 matches so far, and of these, only 1 match did I feel was determine primarily by RNG alone.

As a Dota lore fan, the game is fiiled with fully voiced lore entries that add a ton to the little details of Dota lore. I look forward to continuing to learn about the world as future sets come out.

As for the monetization, this is where it becomes iffy. Straight up, this game is expensive to play if you want to play the constructed format, it's basically the same model as a physical TCG, though a bit cheaper since boosters are about half the price. If drafting is your thing, then the $20 cost of entry is extremely worth it, and drafting is super fun.

Overall, I am thouroughly enjoying the game and I look forward to seeing how the game evolves as new card sets and new features are added.
First of all, Valve's reputation of innovating doesn't disappoint with Artifact gameplay. Second, the lore and strong ties to Dota offer a whole new spin on the game that I love. But Valve can't count to three. The monetization system isn't something I'm used to, and it feels very present in the game if building decks is your style. Would have like a revolutionary card value cut too.

Regardless, Artifact deserves to be played.
Im a former Magic the Gathering Player.

I highly recommend Artifact heres my points:

1.) This game have unbelievable depth of plays / tactics already at launch / yes its not easy but you improve fast in the game.
2.) It never gets boring because of the different game types. You can construct your own Deck or play with a random 5 Pack, both is fun and completely different. 
3.) The Community is great, yes its still small but im a Gamer for 15 Years and 100% sure that the Community will be bigger than Hearthstone. Trust me.
4.) Valve is a great Company and they listen to the Community. They will make this Game successful no matter what. You should not miss out the early phase. 
5.) Dont believe the negativity.  Valve already pushed out 2 Updates to Improve the Game and will Continue in January. All the TCG Competitors will suffer once People try Artifact.
With the addition of a progression system alongside a change in monetization and card balance philosophy, Valve has completely shifted their position on how to handle the game.

What's now left is a complex but thoughtfully created card game. Albeit flawed with RNG elements (mostly in the form of attack arrows), gameplay continues to be extremely satisfying and punishing when you make mistakes (and there are many that you'll make during the course of the game).

Artifact is a joy to play given the price tag and it will only continue to grow from here based on how Valve is willing to pivot and reconsider their game.
For just the cost of the base game, you can play draft at no additional cost, forever. That alone makes it completely worth it. It's a deep, complex card game that rewards skill, I could play it all day (and I have been lol). Highly recommended
do you want a free game? play hearthstone

thats the only point id give hearthstone over artifact, yes it costs money, but hey id rather spend $5 and buy the card i want on the market palce than spend hundred and maybe never get it on hearthstone. there also seems to be some misconception about the entry price point, you arent paying $20 for the game you are paying $20 for 10 packs, the price it costs, in otherwords you are paying for the cards you need to play the game, even if it was a free download youd need the cards to make decks so it wouldnt get you anywhere. 

dropping the business model for a while and talking about the actual game, this is the first time ive played a TCG since i picked up magic all those years ago that actually feels unique and like its doing new things, for those unfammiliar this is effectively a best of three except you play all three rounds simultaneously across three lanes, building a deck also has an interesting twist with hero cards, for those that have played commander in MTG you already know how these work, you choose 5 heroes for deck, which determine your color identity, you can only play spells in a lane if you have a hero that matches the color of that spell, mana also ticks up once per turn like hearthstone, however there is no forced cap of 10 mana. you also have a seperate deck for items, (think equipment if you are coming from MTG) instead of drawing cards from this deck you "buy" them with gold which you earn by either killing your opnents creeps and heroes or from certain cards. 

The game itself is fast paced and displays calculated combat damage for you at all times so that you always know exactly what will happen in the combat phase with the current board state and allows for plenty of strategy when considering weather to go all out to tkae control of a lane or if you would be better off conserving resources for another lane, there are also specific strong cards that can target any lane which allow you to get the best use of your mana in an uncontested lane.

Overall Id say artifact is a fun and unique card game with a fair business model, yes it costs money, everything worth having does. atleast if you decide to walk away froma rtifact in a few years you can sell your cards to recoup cost. goodluck getting any sort of refund partial or otherwise out of blizzard for your hearthstone account.

The game is great, but the main gamemode where you play to earn packs costs one event ticket (about 0.36€) to enter each time. I'd like the game more if you could earn event tickets in a fun and free way.
Artifact is a carefully-designed, visually striking masterpiece of a digital TCG. If you enjoy complex strategy and deck building with a ton of depth, you'll dig this game. If you have a lot of friends who play card games, and you can get them onboard, you'll dig this game a lot. There are tons of playstyles to experiment with, rules to bend and the game itself is just plain fun.

Every game I've played, from constructed matches where my deck is outclassed by my opponent (I've spent $0 at market or on packs) to drafts where the tables turn the other way, have come down to the wire in the final turns. Victory is never assured when any deck may include a high-cost game changer you didn't anticipate. I'm always on my toes, and always itching to play again whether I'm tasting defeat or victory.

And that's because the mechanics are so well-concieved. Think Magic the Gathering if you had respawning Planeswalkers and you had to manage mobility, multiple types of resources and multiple health pools across three different boards. It's a lot to consider. It's a lot to learn.

Concerning the monetization scheme: go into this knowing that Constructed can be very pay-to-win. You can definitely score victories against better decks if you observe the win conditions it's going to try and create and you counter them, but you probably can't get enough wins to earn prizes in competitive with an inferior deck. So you'll run out of event tickets and have to spend money to get back in the game.

There's no surefire way to grind your way to a full collection. If you practice in casual (free) and only play competitive drafts (which are way more fun anyway), you'll give yourself a fighting chance and you can probably build a pretty solid collection from your winnings on just the included bundle of tickets.

Otherwise, expect to put some money into the game. There are people that want every card in the first set right off the bat (about 350 cards total) that will have to spend hundreds to get there. If you want just enough cards to build a viable constructed deck, expect to pay around $25-50 between the market and packs.
Very fun game, mechanics are fresh and enjoyable, gameplay is fluid, I love the timer they added, it's very fair, you get a slight vibe of magic from playing this but it's is own original game. I do hope they add more features in the future and I can't wait to see more cards be revealed and released, for the price this is a good package. You buy buy most of the cards on the market for cheap, you can build a tier one deck for very cheap.
TL;DR: Unique digital card game that's highly interactive and puts it's best foot forward to bridge the gap for physical CCG players. Cards cost money. The community decides how much they cost. If you want to play the community's decided "top tier" constructed cards, be prepared to get lucky, get rich, or find a way to beat them with cards that cost literal pennies. If you can play smart and are willing to learn, you'll beat a lot of people who bought into top tier decks.

Artifact is a unique card game in that it tries to replicate a lot of the structure and environments around a tabletop card game, and in almost every aspect, it succeeds. It's a dense experience, and ultimately doesn't offer much support to help players new to card games to understand it, although it offers plenty of FREE modes to learn the game in and ready access to pre-constructed decks so you can try out different strategies. Players can practice casual matches freely, playing and learning any format that they want (including Drafting, one of the harder card game formats to learn) for FREE. I can't emphasize this enough, the core game modes cost only the games entry price to participate in, regardless of your skill level. Constructed still requires that you own the cards, but many budget deck choices are available.

This game has 4 colours of cards (as opposed to 5 from Magic: The Gathering), and item cards, which are neutral but cost gold (generated by destroying your enemies cards). Red focuses almost exclusively on buffing Red heroes themselves, but has decent creeps to match. Blue heroes are the underdogs, and must use ingenuity to create an advantage and succeed, but usually have incredibly strong spells or abilities to destroy your opponent, including direct damage spells. Green, while mainly supportive, has access to sturdy heroes and ways to delay (or accelerate) the game and push for game-winning turns just by their presence alone. Finally, Black has strong, underhanded spells and tricks that can generate massive advantages by having ways to manipulate the board state in just the right way to win, but can falter if their best laid plans don't line up with your opponents actions. Almost all of the games heroes have found a place in constructed decks, and the initial card set, "Call to Arms", provides a varied set of strategies for the player to indulge in. The subtle ways the player is allowed to determine the outcome of a turn is breathtaking and the tension in trying to figure out if your opponent has access to their strongest cards is always a thrill.

Balance wise, many of the games current "power cards" are carrying a fairly hefty price, as the community is scrambling to figure out the best deck at any given time. Thankfully, many decks can be made from cheaper cards, including Uncommons and staple Common cards for relatively cheap. Notable cards include Drow Ranger and Axe, however many players are simply too inexperienced to capitalize on their usefulness as of the writing of this review: A budget deck costing less than $10 is capable of winning matches against these decks (giving me notable results versus these problem cards), with smart play and good knowledge of the card pool.

A main criticism leveraged against the game currently is the requirement to purchase cards using the Steam Marketplace, using money. Sadly, Valve chose not to sell the game with regional pricing, as to prevent the card market from collapsing. What this means is, if your countries currency isn't either EU or US based, this game is prohibitively expensive to start playing. Since this title also requires that you spend money to purchase card packs, and since many of the community top cards are expensive, this can motivate people with gambling tendencies to purchase numerous packs to open, chasing that value card. To veterans, this is simply a reality of the genre: "Buy packs to draft them" is a common mantra in MtG circles, and one I recommend here. Keeper Drafting lets you pick what cards you want, or value, out of the pack. Packs are rarely loaded with such value that you'll have too much choice given the games mechanics, and as such is very forgiving. I encourage users to know which rare cards are currently selling for high prices before playing Keeper Draft, simply to know in case such a scenario arises. The games integrated "buy cards" menu gives an overview of average market value of a card, and is a useful tool as such.

Artifact is designed for competitive play in mind, and as such the premiere format to test your deck building skill and card knowledge is Draft. Sadly, Artifact does not award a single participation award in it's current design: You cannot earn Event Tickets (for entry to competitive events with prize support) for free. Competitive events are a paid experience, and only players who can produce results will create value in this system. This is a similar reality, once again, to the real world experience of a card game. Many MtG players will spend €5 to play at weekly events with a constructed deck, or €15 to draft at their local game store (with many of the opened cards being unplayable "draft chaff" with zero use or value, other than to give away to new players for free). Valve charges $1 for both of these experiences, with moderate prize support for both, and $12 for Keeper Draft (letting you filter the cards you don't want out of your boosters), meaning that players can pay a very reasonable amount for an evenings worth of entertainment.

Overall, Artifact's depth and extensible framework allows for an incredibly rich and diverse (and difficult) card game with plenty of viable strategies. While I believe the rather deliberate mimicking of a real world environment will price players out of the game compared to other digital card games (by virtue of having a price point at all, really), there's a logic to it that gives long time card game players some comfort knowing that the price of their investment is up front, and that competitive players have something to play for outside of grinding a ladder.
Every card game uses monetization and this is actually on the cheaper side of spending money in comparison to the other big ones.

Just go back to HS oder MTGA and spend much more..
Game is awesome. And coming from Magic the gathering this game is really cheap. I got my first constructed deck with 15€ something you can only dream of when playing Magic. Every game i win feels like really winning. The draft is awesome too and free!
This is easily one of the best games I have ever played, period. The quality of the game is insane for $20. The animations are beautiful and every card feels unique. In my opinion, the complaints about the monetisation of the game are absolutely ridiculous. The $20 entry fee gives you 10 packs and 5 event tickets, which is $25 worth of value. Each pack is $2 dollars and you are guaranteed a rare card. Most of the cards on the market are in the cent ranges, so building a full collection will be $200+ MAX. The event tickets allow you to grind out a draft mode or a constructed mode, both of which you can earn packs and event tickets from. If the game had a Free2Play grind model, the economy would not work the way it does now. Compare this to Hearthstone, a Free2Play game that has a new expansion every few months. I would be SHOCKED if it did not cost me over $300+ to get every card in the expansion. By the way, there is no way to get your money out of that game, so the cards you have are the cards you keep. Artifact is a great game and everyone who complains about the monetisation model wants everything for free anyways, so it would not be the game for them. I love this game to bits and it is just getting started.
It's a great game, one of the best TCG i've played. The monetization model is good IMO, I hate the grinding model of other games, and here I can play free phantom draft or pauper constructed with my friends if I don't feel the need of pay to play.


Noobs need to relise that this is one of the most cheapest card games despite paying for the game.. to get a teir 1 deck in hs cost about 60$ and thats just one deck and only if your lucky enough to un pack the cards, you can legit buy the card/cards you want with this game.
The business model isn't ideal, but this is by far the cheapest and most generous card game that has actual strategic depth. Free casual drafts are almost unheardof in the rest of the industry, and who cares about constructed when you can just draft forever?
After only 2 hours of play I can say that I am enjoying the game so far. 
Hopefully we will get some sort of chat / emotes soon, something similar to the way chat and emotes function in Dota would be great.

People are review bombing the game because of the way that you acquire new cards (either by buying them directly off of the market or buying packs and hoping you get lucky). 

An excellent game where every piece of the monetization model has been known for a long time. Plenty of free modes to enjoy if you don't want to spend more money, including infinite free drafting, borrowing decks from friends, and a rotation of free play modes (including the Call to Arms releasemode which doesn't require you to have your own decks).
I don't play many card games for that single lane feeling and the quick feeling of repetitiveness after playing multiple matches with the same deck.

This game takes a mirror matchup and makes it entertaining like a late game terran verses terran seige in Starcraft 2. At every point in the game, I am feeling both victory and defeat. Each move I make does nothing more than ruin my faith in both directions. Somehow, at the end of the game, even after a loss, it still feels like victory.

That my friends, is a fun, successful game.
So here are some points abut the game

Pros:
+ A really complex yet entretaining Gameplay
+ Diferent modes to chose from 
+ Free modes plus rotating custom modes if you dont feel like paying
+ Can create tournaments with friends or join custom tournaments
+ you may go infinite on paid modes easily thanks to the scrap system
+ you may buy different cards on the market, some really cheap, other more expensive

Cons:
- you could lose all your tickets and get locked from paid modes until you buy more or scrap cards (20 cards = 1 ticket)
- no way to get card packs without spending tickets
- high learning curve
- no trading cards with friends implemented yet (coming in the future)
- no progresion system implemented yet (coming in the future)
TLDR: Game is fun. Mechanics are great, and there seems to be lots of depth. I will be playing quite a bit of this game in the future. There are some negatives, but I consider them rather minor when compared to the positives.

++Free draft modes. You can practice drafting or just screw around with meme decks with no risk.
++Call to Arms seems to be a rotating set of preconstructed decks for you to try.
++The market is great, no buying unlimited numbers of packs hoping for just the right card to complete the perfect deck. A global market will help discover the true value of cards.
++If your unwanted cards are commons selling for $0.02, you can recycle them towards another pack.
++You can just set up tournaments with you friends.
++If you are good (above a 50% winrate), you can "go infinite" in ticketed events. Meaning that you will win your entry fee ticket back and possible card packs.

--The market IS great. However, the fact that Valve takes a 15% cut from all purchases (even on the secondary market) seems steep. But, that the way they've always done things. I've come to terms with that selling cosmetics in Dota 2...but it's still a negative.
--Social aspect of the game seems lacking. I really wish there was a post game chat. After a close game, it'd be nice to exchange GGs and talk about decisions made or really good plays.
--While constructed is not 100% pay to win, there does seem to be that aspect (as expected). This is not something I've experienced, but saw during streams of beta players. Often they would see a couple of the cards, and then comment how they seem to be running a budget version of a deck. Then proceed to crush them, all the while talking about how Axe would be better than Legion Commander in this deck.
--A ladder or MMR system would be nice. I need to be able to talk down to my Herald scrub friends in Artifact.

Overall, the positives far outweigh the negatives. Drafting a new deck for a gauntlet run will keep the game fresh for me. I'll likely stay out of constructed, meaning that lack of key cards will bother me less. I'll play some ticketed events here and there, and on occasion buy more tickets if I want to try and get that reward at the end. But overall, I see myself enjoying the free aspects of the game.
Its a fantastic card game. 2 free decks at beginning plus 10 cardpacks is a good starter, card effects, voice acting, and lore is on point, is a slam dunk card game IMO. One thing its missing tho... there is no communication, you feel very alone in this game.
Unique Mechanics, lots to think about, good theming.

Disagree with most comments on price, it's much cheaper than it's competitors from what I can tell.
SUGGESTION
i love the game and i think daily mission will help alot
3 daily mission a day and the reward is 1 random common-uncommon card that you can't trade or sell but you can recycle it
basically you have a chance to challenge the expert play once every week without ever spending extra money
I play this game because of phantom draft. Playing constructive requires you to get good cards, which costs some money, and I don't know how "fun" it is to play constructive. On the other hand, phantom draft is amazing.

It requires some skill to draft and create "good" deck ( not pay to win ). Then you start playing the game. Gameplay to me is insane. There is some RNG in Artifact, but if you know what you are doing, you can usually beat your opponent, if you are better player. So it is mostly skill based, which is amazing. 

So if you like games, that require you to have some skill, not just luck, then I would recommend this game for you, because gameplay is really good.

On the other hand there are a lot of reason as to why people don't like Artifact, and I hope that some of those reason will get fixed in the future, because gameplay is really really good.
Just played my first few games. All I can say is that Artifact truly is the DOTA 2 card game, but not only because of its matching lore or ported abilities. Artifact, like its MOBA counterpart, poses the same steep incline to new players but also satisfaction and rewards to those who master its strategic depth. I'm going to be very bad for a very long time and that is exhilirating!
- The game is really good, and the overall vibe of the game is spot on. I absolutely love it. The little imps that are on the board are so cute and add so much to the feel of the game. The marketplace is a godsent for a digital card game. It just enables you to get the cards you want or to sell the ones you don't. It's perfect. The market is still fluctuating, so some cards are quite expensive, but they will fall eventually. Phantom draft is really fun. I love the fact you can edit your deck after a game, which is a bigger deal than it sounds. I have nothing bad to say about the gameplay at the moment.

- That being said, there are some bad things aswell. If you like collecting cards and constructing decks with those cards, I would hold off on jumping into the game for now. When you log onto the game for the first time you only get 10 packs and 2 starter decks, along with 5 event tickets you can use to play in the gauntlet. While this sounds good, the problem is that you can't really earn any packs from actually playing anything besides the gauntlet. And even the gauntlet doesn't give you packs unless you win at least 4 games.

- All in all, it's a great game. I would recommend it if you don't mind the crazy marketplace right now, but I reckon it will stabilize in a few weeks.
Absolutely fantastic game.  Deep strategy. Doesn't even feel like a card game at times, more like a strategy game. Pricing model seems to get a bad rap but being an oldschool TCG player myself, this is definitely the most affordable compared to physical card games.  I used to play a lot of Hearthstone but I was always bothered that when sets rotated out I only got 25% of their value back (not a wild player, and find the dust system extremely greedy). Every set of HS I often had to buy 100 packs to get all the cards I wanted from a set, I still wouldn't have a full set, and after 50 packs the last ones felt redundant, like I bought 50 more packs to only get 2 or 3 more legendaries and a pile of dust.  This game is for sure the most fair of all the card games pricing models, but I guess if you have absolutely zero money you might not like it.
I would definately recommend this game.

However, constructed sucks due to the fact that everyone just plays some expensive meta decks, but this is the problem of each card game.
This game shines in the draft modes and tournaments. They are a lot of fun and you can win card packs if you are good. If not, just dont play expert mode.

To the monetary system everyone complains about:
A ticket for expert draft "costs" a dollar. If you have 20 spare cards, you get it for free. I mostly play expert draft and already got some perfect runs. True, sometimes you lose your ticket, but if you win a pack you most likely already compensated. With a bit of luck, like I had, you can even make money by opening expencive cards.
Without the monetary system currently implemented in this game, it would be impossible to have digital cards with mentionable value.
All card games are about collecting card. So I am fine when I need to buy cards for money, but actually you don´t need to buy cards. You can play Casual Phantom draft for 20 dollars (+8 packs) or when you are good enough, you can make money.

Long story short: I love this game and system of playing this is just wonderful.
Constructed is full on Pay2Win

Now that is out of the way let's get to, what I consider, the meat of the game... draft mode. Draft is great because it takes out the Pay2Win aspect and focuses on the gameplay, which is quite good.

Yes there is a lot of RNG, but the amount of "feels bad" games are few and far between

In the end, I recomend playing this game for it's draft mode
Feeling like want to try Artifact out and not commit too much? Play draft! Its free, its enjoyable. Also, there are 3rd party tournaments going on, that don't ask any participation fees.

Besides that, i feel its a enjoyable and nice polished game with platform to grow a great one.
Still have a lot of problems to be solved, card is the most important resource in the game,but new players have no way except buying to get new cards, this cause for new players the only way to get in the game is buying cards in the market. HOWEVER Im SURE most people like me just wanna have fun as dota give us but not have fun with losing money for just a winning screen.
I'm going to have to recommend this game because A, it's actually kinda improving now that Valve is actually trying to balance cards (disregarding the monetization, that's an old-hat discussion by now) and B, the forums are a hilarious shitshow now that Valve has shot-but-not-really the dreams of every single stock-market obsessed manbaby on the Steam forums with the latest patch.

The salt is actually genuine on the forums right now. People are LITERALLY AT EACHOTHER'S THROATS over a change to a fucking card game because they're scared shitless their "investments" were all for nothing.
I guess it would be hard to write a review on this game without talking about the payment model so, I’ll do this briefly.  I’m totally fine with it, I value time spent playing against cost and, to be frank, I can afford it anyway.   I’ve played other digital card games and, as someone who works full time, I’m not a fan of grinding anyway.
On to the game then.  Honestly, I’m enjoying it a lot and I think it’s the best card game I’ve played.  I think the flow of play is much more involving (no ropes here) and, the three lane play makes it very strategic.   I also love the art and think it performs well.

Phantom draft is a great mode and definitely levels the playing field a bit if you don’t want to drop money on building a collection.  

Haven’t seen anything to OP yet either but, I’m sure some things will come out of the meta.  Axe is strong but, not found him too bad.  

Game is great, simply put.  Not sure why everyones freaking out about the cost, honestly, it ends up being cheaper than the other card games like HS or MTG.  You can literally buy the cards for cents on the market, as opposed to just guessing and buyign random packs, like in HS.

Maybe a good game. its too hard to tell to be honest. maybe it is a shitty game. either way, the game gives me no option to turn off the gay boy imps that fly around the board. i dont like them they were a waste of time to design. please give me the option to take them out of my game it must be a simple fix please this makes the game nearly unplayable for me. Also remove any form of RNG out of this game other than the inherent randomness that comes with drawing cards. this is a damn card game why is there a 50/50 if something dies or not that is literally the dumbest idea i have ever seen in a card game. fire whoever designed that card and also the guy who let it into the actual game. or at least give them a swift kick to the dick. but for real the imps are the worst just take them out. i know you are going to make them a bunch of hats and stuff like dota but at least let me take them off the game. thank you
Got a profit of 100$ at launch because I sold 3 Axe cards. 

Out of all the card games that I've played, this one is probably my favorite. I've played both Pokemon TCG, Gwent, Hearthstone and MtG. 

Once you buy this game - every mode that you'd like to play is unlocked, including draft mode, which - theoretically means that you have every card when you'd like to draft. 

The paid-to-play gamemodes are a little expensive and not enough rewards for doing well. You can't go "infinite". For those that struggle with these gamemodes, they have the free alternatives which are also really popular. There is a gamemode for everyone.

The mechanics and gameplay are really fun, and offers some really great mind-boggling thinking from time to time. Now that the public has recieved the game, we all will look forward to what kind of crazy combos will happen and which synergies to adept towards.
Overlooking the poor setup and use of microtransactions, this is a very fun game. The mechanics are fun and very unique, and I enjoy this far better than Hearthstone. The price of card packs doesn't bother me, since in Hearthstone they expect you to cough up £2.99 for 5 cards, yet Artifact is only £1.59 for 12, and you can sell any dupes unlike Hearthstone - so why is it Artifact gets all the flak for microtransactions but nobody bats an eyelid at Hearthstone? It's favouritism and everyone wants to suck Blizzards dick because they can do no wrong, obviously.

So, microtransactions aside, I think this is a very unique and fun card game and I hope to pour a lot of time into this. You're not really paying for the game exactly since they give you a bunch of free card packs to get you started, which maybe wasn't the best approach, but I can overlook it because I'm very satisfied with the game.

If you aren't happy with this games microtransactions system, that's fine, just don't give Hearthstone a free pass when they're even worse.
The best Digital card game available. I dont fully understand why the monetisation model is getting so much hate. It is so much better than the likes of Hearthstone or Gwent. You dont have to grind for what you want or sink huge amounts of money into packs. You can buy the cards that you want and sell the ones you don't.
I never liked digital card games (Hearthstone+Gwent) all that much but this is actually fun and intuitive. 
With free draft, prebuilt decks and casual play, I don't even see a big incentive to spend a lot of money - business model seems okay for me.
I haven't had too much time in-game to fully understand the intricacies of the game, however the core mechanics keep me locked in and ready to queue into the next match even after a crushing defeat and that's why I can see myself sinking many hours into this game. Artifact offers a fresh new experience into the online TCG market that is currently flooded with knock-offs and clones.
Good game, very original mecanics, it's true that monetisation is a problem. But not the most important one right now the game is clearly lacking of different game mode. No ladder, nothing. It's weird. They should do free season ladder where you could win paquets and this kind of things. 

The game itself is very good, if they put effort on it, it could be very interested but for now, not so much. Add a chat to the game too, it's insane to not have one.

I recommend it anyway, for people that are looing for something new. Expect to spend 100$ to have fun IMO.
Its a card game with really deep gameplay, we need have a great decision skill, we missplay once and we will lost!
For people that not have enough budget to buy, actually just relax because we can sell our card to steam, it means when we purchase something from artifact, its not burn at all but we can get it back when we want to sell our card to steam market, and actually we can get more of it!
Simply a great card game!
A must try for all who love the genre.

For me it is also much better that it isn't a grind to get new and good cards.
I can understand it might suck for some but for me it would be a reason not to buy or play a card game if it needs grinding hours on it.

I wanted to be able to just play and learn the game and see other players cards unfold with new abilities and so on.
When I see something interesting I just right it down and I can just say ok I am buying this card 3x and that's it.

It's much more oriented at spending time valuable then other card games, imo.

And cards cost almost nothing, expect a few exeptions ofc. Still with low money you can already build a decent deck and from that point you can just say, I try to play this deck as good as possible and build on with 1euro per week or month for upgrades or changes and you own a great deck in no time.

All the critic about pay to win is bullshit to me.
You could like get all the cards in the game in triple for like 100€ or something... I would like to see any other cardgame where you can buy all cards in triple for this amount, and yes I know it's only the first set of cards available but atleast you have a great steam market to support the purchase and selling of all cards... Valve makes lots of money with it but you can also manage your money and try not invest to much to be able to sell it when a card isn't relevant anymore for your game.

All in all 9/10 -> I would like to see the option for friend matchup with drafting please! And since it is against a friend, it might as well be live drafting as well!

Wp valve, now go upgrade csgo to source engine 2 and give me a videogame with a great hl2 episode 3 ending! 
Thanks in advance :)
Very polished product and impressive presentation. Introduction games teach all the basic rules need to play. Gives me a great feeling of playing as a shotcaller in a DotA match or any moba. Even card specific rules are easy to understand. I see a lot of other reviews commenting of the payment model of this, I must disagree to their issues of expense and pay to win. This game is designed to be a TCG without having to drive to your local shop. As of writing this review a full common rarity playset cost me five bucks, and it gives you a lot of options right there. Most expensive card is 15 if you are chasing the meta game. If you want a strategic card game experience and loads of game modes I greatly recommend this title.
I like the game a lot. It's not that expensive and with just the base game you can play endlessly using all the cards without owning them. I know people with bitch and complain but if you really are strapped for cash my suggestion would be to recycle the cards you get from your 10 free packa and then get tickets. Then use those to draft in tiers that give card packs as rewards and tickets back. Then you wont need to spend money besides the investment. You just have to be good but that isnt hard once you have a handle on the game. If you are worried about price then just take it seriously.
Cool game to expend some time playing with your friends or, if you are eager to compete, to get deeper into the different play modes it has to offer. The gameplay feels interesting, innovative and has a lot of deph and variance (matches rarely feel the same even after playing a ton with the same decklist).
The game looks really clean, it's not hard to follow after a few games. I don't like the art personally and some animations could use some "woah" effects. In this aspect there is a lot of room for improvements in the future.
Is this game expensive? Depends, it doesn't have any grinding (thank god). And if you want an entire collection right now (launch day) it cost about $300 to build it from the market. Compering that to the $500+ I burnt during the HS beta seems cheaper.
All in all it's a good game with a lot of room for improvement. I hope you are not afraid about all this p2w comments, it's nonsense. For $20 you get a lot of hours of enjoyment and there are a lot of free play modes to try.
Gameplay wise the game is excellent and there is a free draft mode. A lot of reviews here complain alot about monitization. Anyone thats played a game with an economy knows that you can't just introduce free cards into the economy without crashing the value of cards. TBH Artifact is far cheaper compared to Hearthstone for a midrange to hardcore player (as you can buy singles avoiding loot box packs) while very unnatractive to someone expecting progression and free cards you can earn.
*Pros and Cons at the at the end of the review * I'll keep the review updated*

[strike]Despite only playing for 5 hours, I've got a pretty good image about this game (I was following it for a good while).[/strike] Now that I got to peak in myself, I can comfortably say that Artifact is one of the best online card games out there. While people will be turned off by the price model (understandable), it's still not as expensive to play Artifact as it might seem from the backlash it's recieving. 

Here's what you can do for free after buying Artifact:
[list]
    [*]--Play the featured event; the current event is "Call to Arms"where there are 6 pre made decks you can play with against an opponent. You opponent picks form the same 6 decks. This one will last until the 14th of December of 2018, then the event rotates.
    [*]--Play contructed against friends, opponents (casually there are 2 variants), or practice agaisnt a bot.
    [*]--Play draft. There's a free version of draft.
[/list]

[h1]So the long talk about the pricing, value, and such... [/h1]

Well, this is the hot topic and this is what most people want to talk about really, so let me share my honest views. While you don't recieve any rewards for playing the non-ticket modes, it's still fun to play even without spending more. Unless you like building from your own pool of cards, drafters however can still have fun for free and then take on expert phantom or keeper draft when they're ready. 

Building decks isn't too expensive, apart from few cards, like Axe, most other cards are dirt cheap already. Where you can generate a lot of value is keeper draft, if you're good at the game you don't have to spend a lot to keep playing this mode, you get to keep all the cards you draft (so you can even snipe what you need) and potentionally get rewarded with more than you've entered with. And this really goes for the other expert modes, ones that require an event ticket but reward you for doing well.

Every duplicate that is not worth much selling can be recycled, after recycling 20 cards you get a free event ticket for exper constructed or draft (phantom and keeper draft). For example, after I've opened the first 10 packs I was given with the purchase, I recycled 15 duplicates from it that I didn't feel like selling for cents. I also unboxed a hero that was fluctuaiting between 6 - 8$ in value at the time.

Obviously, if you don't have any income, then Artifact might be a tough one to get into if you like to stay up to date in cunstructed meta, or if you like to play competetivel. You can play free draft and the other free modes, which is fun as I prefer drafting, but some are into consutrcted, and so if you are a fan of cunstructed and you are a student withou any disposable income, then big oof dude. 

However, when it comes to paying for the cards to build the decks you need, it's more fair than any other digital card game I've played so far. While in other games you can grind for free (remeber your time is NOT a free resource), it takes a hellishly long time to get meta decks. In Artifact, everyone has equal oportinuty in the marketplace. The value of pack is very good since there are only 4 rarities and you get 12 cards per pack and you're always guaranteed to get 1 rare (highest rarity), a hero and 2 items. And to repeat this point, you can completely bypass buying packs and just getting exacly what you need. And if you get good rarity duplicates from your expert play, you can sell them to fuel your Artifact addiction.

[h1] Ok, what do I think about the other aspects of the game? [/h1]

First of all, it's fun. It's got depth to it, it's got some complexity, but the complexity adds up together and makes sense. But that's not a big surpirse, gameplay-wise, Richard Garfield is simply the guy you can rely on to deliver the quality. There's no point in talking about the gameplay though, it would be a lot more simple to just look at a video that explains how Artifact is played, because typing it out... well, that would just take too long and no one would want to read it either way.

Now the UI, visuals, music, performance, network - really great, really comfy, it's nice to look at, it runs well, so far haven't encountered any issues.

*Edit- I have had the game crash once, during a match. Luckily, I was able to reconnect so quicly that I didn't lose out on anything.

[b]PROS[/b]
[list]
    [*]+ Unique and fun gameplay
    [*]+ Many modes to choose from
    [*]+ Building decks is more accessible, you can get the specific card you want
    [*]+/- High skill cieling, a lot of depth and strategizing involved [i](COULD BE A NEGATIVE - it depends on what you're looking for)[/i]
    [*]+ Art, visuals, UI
    [*]+ Music (I am a doggie! FrankerZ)
    [*]+ Good performance, network/servers are stable in my experience
    [*]+ It is in possible, in theory, to go infinite. Of course you need to be very good to begin with. (Get return in tickets and even bonus packs)
[/list]

[b]CONS[/b]
[list]
    [*]-  While the pricing is fair imo, it still is something other might not like, fans of CCGs and LCGs will be turned off. This might change in the future.
    [*]- No direct player to player trading (yet)
    [*]- Even if you generate a lot of value, money is still trapped inside your steam wallet. Gaben's perfect trap.
    [*]- Games can be long
    [*]-/+ Casual players might find learning slope to be too steep, or perhaps just convoluted [i](THIS REALLY IS EITHER A PRO OR A CON, again, depends on who you ask)[/i]
    [*]- RNG can sometimes be unfair
[/list]

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

If you like card games with depth (the likes of MTG), prefer the model of paying to get what you want as oppsoed to grinding or relying on the dice rolls to maybe get something worth, if you want to spend time with a card game and grasp it's dpeth and take your time to get good at it, Artifact is something I absolutely reccomend to you. I really need to emphasise that the gameplay is amazing for anyone who likes strategy, complexity and card games.

[b]HOWEVER[/b] - if you expect to be able to recieve free rewards and you want to play competively without any additional investments besides the purchase, or you prefer more simple card games (for example if MTG turns you off and you just like to chill with HS), Artifact will probably not be a game I could reccommend for you!
The game is incredibly complex and despite the randomness, obviously requires skill. While others will say that it's pay2win, that isn't really the case. I received the game for free but assume $20 for that. With the exception of a couple of cards, you can get everything else for under $10, completely reasonable. If you know what you want, (like me) you can spend as little a few dollars. The market at release is a little volatile with some cards overpriced, expect that to change.

Overall, the game is a TRADING card game and a damn good one at that. The game actually rewards good players who know what they're doing. Pick up this game, it's worth it even if you're not a Dota fan.
I was hyped for this game, and it exceeded even my rather high expectations. Ive been a casual MTG player for most of my life, and played dota for a while, so i was on board once this was announced. And after waiting till now at release, its even better than i was expecting. Despite a lot of small RNG interactions, the overall game feels completly skill-based, and going back through the game I can see when and where the game was won or lost, and which decisions did what. Even with only one set out so far, the game feels very deep, and will only get better as new sets and interactions are added. The monetization is similar to that of paper MTG or MTGO, but a lot cheaper for most cards. Being able to buy the exact cards you need from the market and not grinding away for weeks for small amounts of dust is a huge win in my opinion, though I know a lot of people in this era are all about FTP drip feeds of content and miniscule value for their time.
[u]Cheaper than blizzard's casino "hearthstone"[/u] bcs of its monetization model. it really saves your money.
also has better interesting gameplay which actually feels like a skill-based game and not casino (comparing to hearthstone).
A rich and detailed card game which mimics a traditional card game. One of the few - if not the only - games in which there is a *free draft mode*. I love drafting - it's always behind a microtransaction price.

Buyer does need to beware - as of yet - there isn't any progression in the game. You play for your own enjoyment - which is a good thing that the game is fun as hell and only likely to get better.
People seem to be confused. DRAFT. FREE. FOREVER. This right here is worth the price of admission even if you got no packs no tickets and no decks. I dont know how many of these negative reviewers have actually played a card game before but this game is absolutely dirt cheap while being fantastically fun/well done on top of that.
I heard all the whining about the game before it went public. Most current CCG players seem to be spoiled on the F2P model. I personally was happy to get the cards I got for the 20 bucks I paid for the game. I don't mind buying cards or packs to build my decks. It's how it was done years ago. Not every game can be F2P. Honestly, being able to buy individual cards on the store is awesome. A lot of ccgs you can't do that. I can put a deck together pretty easily like this plus sell cards off I don't want or have extra of. 

Give the game a chance. It's a lot of fun. Your not getting everything handed too you and that's just fine.
One of the best tcg's I've ever played.  There are some issues but am excited and looking forward to where valve takes this game in the near and far future!!
Probably the best digital card game available and most indepth. The monetisation isn't that bad, its just for the first week the card prices are going to be insane (as with any new game). Should hopefully get better in a week or two, prices have already been plummeting hard.

Really enjoying the game though, I've tried Hearthstone, Gwent, etc. I love the idea of online card games but could never get into them until Artifact.
It's a collectable card game, with a number of modes that let you play the game without buying cards.

That is to say, it's a game for CCG players, as well as casuals like me who enjoy playing with pre-made decks. I really have nothing bad to say about the game, it's complex enough that it keeps me thinking throughout the game and I never feel like I'm losing to the game, rather than my opponent.


With the latest update I feel like this game is in a very good spot. With the ability to get free cards and tickets through play now and being able to buy certain cards directly to finish up your deck you never feel locked out of anything. Very difficult and fun game.
Awesome card game. People are saying the monitization is bad but I disagree. This game is much cheaper than hearthstone, it just doesn't allow you to grind for 8 hours a day trying to get one free pack. Instead you can simply buy any card, most of which are less than 7 cents. Not to mention you can SELL your cards if you ever get done playing it and get most your money back.

The games are intense fun that do average about 15-30 minutes.

I would recommend this to any card game player.
Really enjoy this game.  The more I play the more I enjoy it.  The strategy is so variable based on your deck vs your opponents deck.  I have already purchased packs and will do so in the future.  I don't see this as a downfall as much as a standard part of any CCG be it digital or cardboard.  Will be recommending to my friends for sure.
Yes, you buy packs with money just like if you want to play MTG. The RNG is either great or terrible, but it adds chaos to a game of strategy. I'm a pretty casual CCG/TCG player, but I love this game. It feels fresh, new, and exciting. It is a little disheartening that you don't earn anything from your play time (no packs, cards, achievements, etc.), but I currently have enough fun with this game where I'm not too worried. I'm sure they will implement something later on for ranked/reward system. It's valve, not EA.
Pretty fun TCG with some interesting mechanics that take advantage of the digital format to do things that paper cards couldn't. A bit confusing to learn but something I plan to stick with for a while.

Notes on microtransactions, compared to Hearthstone:
- Initial costs lets you play constructed or draft for free, forever. It's only when you go into the "expert" mode where possible free packs are on the line that you have to pay out. If you win three matches then you get your ticket back, four gets you a free pack. Identical to the Hearthstone Arena, just half the cost and it tells you what you are getting upfront.
- There is no currency in-game to buy new packs from just playing. Will not be an issue if you play drafts, as you pick from all availible cards. This is offset by purchased packs being more economical, with the $2 packs getting you 12 cards (one guaranteed hero) versus $1.50 hearthstone packs getting you five.
- You can easily buy the cards you need off the marketplace within the game if that's your bag.
- Again, free casual draft play is free forever, and should let you play with the entire array of cards, even through expansions, without paying a cent more than the initial $20.

The fears about microtransactions are largely unfounded by the low standards of TCGs.
Erase other negative recomended belowe or above. In other TCG, we must spent our money to some points, and spent that point to buy a card or pack.  And usually, its more expensive. In artifact u just need to pay for cards, or for pack , instantly with ur money
The gameplay is great so far. I'm having some issues evaluating cards, which is good; if I had figured it out by now I'd be pretty disappointed. The lines of play I've encountered so far are complex, even without instant-speed spells. The 3 boards make spending resources well a challenge. I don't know how to feel about some of the RNG yet, but it's tamer than some other digital card games. The presentation is incredible; even to the point where every card has voiced flavor text.

Despite the clammoring, the monitization model is fine. If you never aim to play constructed, you can literally just do phantom drafts over and over again for free. If you do want to play constructed, it's a cheaper barrier to entry than just about any other card game, digital or otherwise, presuming you value your time at all. (e.g. Yes, you can build meta decks in Hearthstone "just by playing", but it will take you an extremely long time to grind.) [Also, I'm speaking as somebody from the U.S.; I understand the monitization/market may not work as well in other countries.]

Your $20 gets you a full game. To play with friends or strangers. To experiment with other formats (Commons Only, etc.). To run custom tournaments. To play an endless amount of drafts. I really can't see what the complaining is all about.
So, I want to address the criticism over Artifact's monetization. There are so many negative reviews saying that it's a "credit card game" and that it's just there to soak up your wallet's cash. This really isn't true, or at least it isn't more true for this game than other card games. See, Valve does ask for a $20 entrance fee, and the only way to get cards (at least on launch) was by straight buying them from the market. But you want to know what other game uses this exact same model but is way worse yet well beloved? Magic: The Gathering. Yes, I know technically magic is free to play and you can borrow decks from friends and whatnot, but regardless you still need to pay for every single card in magic, the same you do in Artifact. But the card prices in Artifact are about 10 times cheaper than those in Magic, and that's intentional.

Firstly, there's no "Legendary" or "Mythic Rare" equivalent in Artifact. There's only 3 rarities, so there's not going to be any of those insane $80 cards like there are in Magic. In fact, the most expensive card right now is like $8.00. And a huge number of cards, even good ones, are below 15 cents. This means you can make basically any budget deck you want for the price of a coffee, and a full collection costs way less than Magic or Hearthstone's classic collection. AND you get to play what you want. The grind just isn't there. Unless you really want to play top tier competitive decks, this is a much better deal than those games, and even if you are the person who wants to play those decks, they're going to cost a fraction of what that would take in Magic, or goodness forbid trying to buy enough packs in HS just hoping to get what you want.

Secondly, even if this doesn't interest you, Artifact has a free competitive draft mode. If you only know about HS, basically think of this like a free Arena but with no rewards. You just get to play with fun. So for a flat $20 you can still play the game  in a competitive format. Almost all of my playtime has been in draft, and it's great. 

Lastly, Valve just updated the game, and not only did they inroduce a mechanism to earn packs for free just by playing, they also said they're going to do card balance, and have already begun buffing and nerfing particular cards. This is actually amazing, because it seemed for a long time they were only going to change cards as a last resort to keep the market value of cards stable, but the balance means they are now going to be actively involved in keeping a competitive and fun meta game, and I am thrilled about Artifact's future. 

Overall, really good. There are still some gameplay concerns, but this has to be one of the deepest and best value for money CCG's on the market now.
Super complex and very fun.  It does begin to feel stale pretty quickly though.  They will need to introduce new modes/ways to play for this game to succeed.  Overall it's a good game but I'm not sure how highly I would recommend it right now
Pay 2 Pay? That's rubbish and here's why

1. EVERY card you get from packs/draft can be bought/sold on steam marketplace, this effectively makes the game just like a physical card game as cards maintain their value.
2. Because you can buy cards you want this also makes the card game [b]cheaper[/b]. yes cheaper. This is because unlike other cardgames (Gwent, Hearthstone etc) You are forced to open up RNG packs which will most likely not contain the cards you want.
3. The long term balancing of cards etc will be very easily accessible and managable as they can look at the card economy and balance off of it. For example 'war axe' is currently very powerful and expensive, Valve can see this and hopefully they can adjust the card accordingly to make it of less power.
This game is great, but when it makes you play against similar skill players (hidden mmr) and it expects you to go at least 3-1 (75% winrate) to get any rewards, this makes it a bit ridiculous... 

After the patch though with some progression and rewards added + nerfs/buffs the state of the game is so much better then it was.

There are still a LOT of things that need to be done but the game itself is absolutely amazing so Im changing my review to a thumbs up.
An excellent card game with a controversial monetization model.

Just to preface this, once you buy the game you do have access to both free constructed play and free draft so a draft player theoretically could just sell their starter packs and never pay again.

The Pay2Win aspect has been largely overstated, and many people are upset about the upfront cost in a genre that's generally free to start. For $20 USD you get two starter decks, 10 card packs, and 5 event tickets. Since card packs are $2 each, the game's base price is essentially a 10 pack buy in. Artifact could definitely have been free to play and just given you the starter decks like many other card games, but that wouldn't allow it to have a functioning card economy. The 10 pack buy in is a deterrent to people who might make duplicate accounts and try to profit off of selling or recycling the starter deck cards. I think in the long run having a card market will end up making the game much cheaper than free to play titles if you want to be competitive, but it probably won't be ideal for very casual players.
A fresh wind in the card game market. I really like the draft mode, it's like what Eternal did which is better than Arena in Hearthstone. As for constructed, people are so bad right now, they just netdeck and don't know how to play it. I managed to beat them with a cheap blue-black aggro deck. Because they only know red and green cards lol

The things that I don't like is Silence also Mute your items. Coming from DotA, this is not intuitive at all! But yea it doesn't have to be like DotA.
given the nature of this being a tcg paying for packs seems only natural, not that i wouldnt like to play for free but it was forseable and  it's also reasonble. I'll just stick to playing draft till' i can muster up money to play contructed.

the game itself is wonderfully designed with great music and just being very visually appealing to look at. I hope for future expansion of this game we can see more interesting card design that being said i can only see the game getting better as time goes on.


Artifact is a TCG for people who want something deeper than Hearthstone and without the mana flood/screw of MTG/Eternal.  Every game I have played so far has been very back and forth and player determined, as opposed to Hearthstone which became very rote over the 4 years I have played it.  Some people don't like the monetization model, but I have no problem with being able to only buy the cards I want, YMMV.  Thumbs up
Game is insanely good. Matches are super intense. Feels very different from other card games like mtg and hearthstone, so if you are looking for those games, this isn't going to feel the same.

People complaining about monetization were either people who got the game for free before the game started, or are just completely ignorant of the actual monetization scheme.  

I spent 15 dollars and bought pretty much 3 copies of every normal card and 1 of each of the heroes on the market (all you could ever need in constructed). Sure if you never win you can't play the competative modes without spending some money. Its like, dare I say it, real life tournaments and competative modes! you can't enter a poker tournament without putting some money down yourself unless you are playing in some sort of mega huge event maybe.

If you do win and consistantly get 3 or more wins you can play infinitely, Especially considering you can transmute extra cards into event tickets.

But they would rather grind for 6000 hours in hearthstone playing against people who put hundreds of dollars in it to instantly have all the overpowered cards because it gives the appearence of doing something for free.

People complaining about a progression system need to calm down. Just get some friends and play with them, if they are too easy then you are getting better, then go search out some competative groups on reddit and play against people in those groups, once you start beating them consistently maybe become a pro player. Playing against friends, or anyone you have some sort of common connection with will be 1000% times more rewarding than just grinding against randos to make a number next to your name get higher.

That said, the game does have some problems right now tbh; no chat system. Whats the point of marketing all this social focused stuff if you don't have a chat feature, or even an emote feature of some kind. I want to be able to complement my opponent on a good play when they pull something out of nowhere, or do something I'd never thought of, or be salty when they outplay me. Just mute if you can't handle human interaction or someone is BMing you. 

I would say no trading is a problem, but the prices are so insanely cheap that it doesn't even matter.
Initially I thought the idea behind being able to buy and sell cards but not being able to earn them in the standard grinding fashion was a risky move. Indeed it proved to be risky for valve since it got so much flak. But as I played this game, tried out pauper decks (cheap decks with only commons), and realized only a few cards are worth more than 10 cents. This game ends up being one of *the cheapest* TCG games to play in a serious manner. And currently the sales model as it stands encourages price *deflation* of all the cards as time goes on and more people open packs. 

In hearthstone or other online free to play TCG games, you cant just *make* the deck you want easily, without relying on some really bad RNG, even if you want to pay. Here you can make a coherent and solid deck for under 3 dollars. And if you invest in a couple key cards (also not prohibitively expensive) you can make a serious competitive deck. 

Overall, ignore the crazy criticism online, This game is a real solid TCG which ends up being less expensive than any other, even with the 20 dollar buy in fee.
While I disagree with their monetization model, I think that unlimited drafts and social/friend matches with very interesting and intriguing gameplay mechanics is worth the base price of Artifact. I am not interested in paying for packs or competitive modes; so I'll be playing vs bots (opponent not thinking = quicker matches), draft modes (to get to know cards and diferent play styles) and against friends. I think Richard Garfield and Valve have come up with quite an engaging core loop and rewarding dynamics.
Also, the lore and the theme from Dota 2 makes everything a bit easier to understand and fun to interact with if you're coming from Dota (as I do). This game (and Dota's Turbo) is my go-to for when I have ~20 minutes to spare.
[b]Recommended to Trading Card Game and Strategy/Tactics fans, while anybody else should try. Avoid if you expect f2p progression systems/grinding for cards, as the only way to get cards is paying for them after the base price.[/b]
Even though it is heavily criticize for the card packs but the core of the game is really unique unlike any digital card game out there. I highly recommend this game if you really have a strategic mindset in playing and it is so fun to play. Even though it is hard to understand but then you get the core ideas on how to play the game it can really be enjoyable to play.
This game is cheaper than any other TCG out there in terms of getting a full collection. 

This doesn't mean it's perfect, some form of reward should be implemented, and the social features should be improved as well. 

I can see this game be very entertaining in the long run and for people willing to pay it's probably the best option thanks to the steam market. 

For "F2P" players on the other hand the game will get stale pretty quickly, especially with the missing reward system. 

It's a double edged sword really. I do like it and IMO the monetization is fine if you know what you are getting but the critisism is valid. 

80 hours in, still terrible. What a complex game.

Pros: 
[list]
[*]Incredible, complex and promising
[*]So many possibilities, draft mode makes every hero/card viable/usable/useful somehow
[*]Dota 2 lore is a plus for me, personally
[*]Different from any card game out there
[*]Extremely rewarding and every win/loss makes you think about what you could've done differently
[*]Valve listens to the community most of the times
[*]Runs on almost every computer
[*]Comes with 10 packs and 5 tickets (and 2 complete basic decks) so you get more than the money's worth of material in-game, although it could be 5 packs, 2 tickets and the game would be half the value. I'd certainly prefer it that way.
[*]You can buy and sell the cards in the market.
[*]You can transform your duplicate cards into tickets for the competitive modes.
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]Kind of expensive, especially for those outside NA/EU. 
[*]Extremely complex, not that newbie-friendly for new players that have never played card games before
[*]Doesn't have a "free-mode" for testing all the cards with bots, for example. Although in draft mode you can, more or less, use any card (it's random, but hey, every card is available to appear).
[/list]
The game is fun, I am convinced that the people who are giving this game negative reviews over the monetization are too young to have played physical card games and started with Hearthstone.
I think its an enjoyable game. I don't think it's a game for everybody. The people that like this game will REALLY like it but the average person will turn it off. It's most similar to Gwent as far as the other online tcgs.
ok, I must say the dev team is really work on making this game, for the latest update, I really feels the game is getting better. I am gonna change back my review to positive and I believes other players can feels the same thing I just felt, good luck in the battle field!
The fact that people bought this game knowing exactly what the monetization model was then complained about the model in reviews is honestly pretty amazing to me. It's a good game, on the surface the monetization seems pretty horrible but it's a hell of a lot better compared to games like hearthstone.

+Mechanics are really solid, simple to understand, hard to master. For the most part.
+Great art, great music.

-Most voice acting is fairly lame.
-Many card visual effects are pretty meh, and the game could use more obvious indicators for cards effected by buffs and the like.
-There's a small handful of cards that are very obviously more powerful than others in their catagory, and obviously they're on the market for a high price. It can be a bit oppressive at times, as expected.

The game is in a weird spot, for a card game as young as this to start off with only a few hundred cards and some of those cards consist of clearing every single hero/creep in a lane to there being a 50/50 chance of creeps/heroes on one side not dying is... odd. Usually games eventually power creep to effects like that but Arifact starts out with them right away, so it makes me wonder exactly how they're going to be releasing new cards, if they're going to be doing that at all. Not to mention how they're going to handle how you aquire the new cards.


TL;DR: 

If you like card games and the game seems like something you'd want to be playing, you'll probably be happy with the $20 pickup. The game has ups and downs but comparing it to games that have had a long time to develop expansion after expanion isn't exactly fair, but that doesn't mean people shouldn't be worried about the future of the game.
This is a good game, its much cheaper than you'd think because of the steam market.

There's a lot of misinformation out there being spread, and it's unfortunate that so many people are gullible.
In my opinion, this is the best card game out there. There's a lot of strategy when building a deck and the 3 board concept is really fun and interesting. Highly recommended!
Give it a chance.
After the new update and the introduction of grinding for packs A LOT of past complaints have been fixed. 
The game /is/ a time sink, matches take about 30+ minutes, so if you're not looking for a big time investment maybe its not your cup of tea. But let me put it this way 26 dollars CAD gets you 20 packs and a lot of tickets, something that would cost you maybe 30+ CAD to buy separately.
Draft modes are awesome and require no money spent to play with all the cards from the set :))
Try it ! you can get through the tutorial and refund as long as you don't accept the opening packs an the tutorial lets you play two matches. 
Its genuinely a very fun game.

Fun game with interesting mechanics. But as others have said, the biggest mistake is that you need to pay for the game and then you need to buy packs to get more cards. However, you get some packs for buying the game as well. I do not recommend buying packs in this game tho, find what you want and buy singles.

Usually the games are fun and each hero has some use, but some heroes are clearly better than others. It remains to be seen how the balancing will be in the future.

IRL I play a lot of Magic The Gathering but I think the MTG arena BETA "has not played after the BETA" was not what I wanted from the game and Hearthstone is nice on the bus but I never play it on my computer. But I appreciate Artifact's game format and I think it suits computer play.

I give it a 7/10
[h1]Great design, Good value[/h1]
So this game has maybe the most interesting and in depth design and mechanics since MTG. Matches can easily take half an hour and the game really requires you to pay attention, think hard and think ahead.
Regarding the value proposition, for me it's awesome. I can play phantom draft forever whithout sinking a penny, as well as the featured modes which are going to rotate regularly. I'm honestly not even going to open the starting packs.

Been playing Hearthstone since beta and I gotta say, Artifact is far more complex and fun. It really is the Dota of card games. I recomend it to everyone, especially to Dota players and Hearthstone players that seek a bigger challenge. You won't go wrong with Artifact
we need rank/turbo mode and in game chat!!! 

good game but still in beta ..
just let me know i pay for what
and play for what too

i love that manga btw
this game is the best card game i use my moms powerfull card, credit card and my mom also use the powerfull weapon even created not infinity gauntlet it is the infinity broom stick and infinity hanger. my mom and my family is poor now but my artifact is richer than my whole family. i love gaben. gaben is our lord. i love gaben stomach he is like pregnant but a poop baby. big fat nigga
Very deep, yet quite interesting card game interpretation of DOTA.  

Cons:
Games are a bit longer and more intense, require planning and thinking.  
There is a cost to play.  Unlike others in the genre.  You can probably have everything you need for the 20 bucks to buy the game plus another 10-20 to buy all the non-chase rare heroes.  Which, btw, you don't need and should settle down int eh marketplace.  Note that cards can be converted to tickets at a rate of about a nickel per card, so it's pretty easy to be able to continually play just by doing keeper drafting after that intitial outlay of funds.
Does not seem to be a mulligan option for opening hand, so in addition to the way lane movement is done, RNG can impact games now and again.

Pros:
Very polished game
Plenty of DOTA references if you care for that sort of thing
Strategy is deep
Cards seem balanced but also splashy - the whole 3 lane thing is a novel take on what elder scrolls card game did.

Despite all the talk on microtransactions, with less than U$10,00 I could buy enough cards for a decent starter deck.
I definitely like the non existence of daily rewards and I enjoy the game for letting me play just for the fun of playing it.
It's been a long time since I've played online games where, even loosing, I could have fun without frustration. By having no rewards, Artifact let me focus on the fun part of playing a CCG.
It seems to me that this is a card game where skill counts more than an overpowered deck. And this is just awesome for a CCG (especially when compared with games such as Hearthstone).
Yes there are some missing features: profile, matchmaking history, chat, replay, etc... But I do believe everything will come soon enough.
Anyone bitching about this being not F2P is both an idiot, and doesn't understand the game economy. 

For other games like MTGA and Hearthstone, you have to spend thousands to get the cards you need. Currently, you need to spend a bit over $200 to get every single copy of every single card you need for artifact. I have two decks built, both very competitive, and each was about $15 -- and I STILL have two expensive cards I'm not using and can sell at any moment. The best part? I can go ahead and sell all my cards back, and essentially get all the money I spent so far back with no loss.

That dumb complaint aside, Artifact is an incredibly deep game with easy to learn mechanics. As a veteran MTG player, I was zooming through this game after two matches. Strategy is crazy, though - I'm just now beginning to understand what effects are most valuable in the game, but its really exciting to play and see a game be explored in real-time, kind of like magic back in the late 90's.

Play it. New sets are only going to make the game even more awesome.
As someone who has played many different online CCGs and TCGs (Hearthstone, Gwent, Eternal, Pokemon), Artifact scratches an itch that none of the others did - it's deeply strategic and phantom draft is the epitome of competitive card gaming.
I bought the gamee.
I played some time.
I understood that there is no sense for playing construct games (with my own deck).
I sell all my card = almost return the game cost.
Valve updated Artifact, now I can get free packs when I level up.
I sell every card from the packs = return the Artifact's cost, even a little more.
So I get a free Artifact and there are many levels with free packs I will get. Thanks Gabe.

About game:
Gameplay is very good = 8/10
Visual and UI are very good = 8/10
Monetization is strange and not ordinary = 6/10
Game and economy are more or less exactly as Valve announced all along - with the exception of card recycling being added due to popular demand.

Not a cheap game, but no TCGs are, sadly. If you're committed to spending money it's cheaper than HS but the lack of a free grind will turn lots of people away. For me the 'free grind' of HS is exactly what turned me away from that game so I'm very happy with Artifact in that regard.

The actual card game is very sleek and fun - imo deeper than MTG and HS overall. Draft modes especially are a lot of fun and the free tournaments you can set up are awesome.
Not really interested in card games, but this one was given to me, so I gave it a try.

Looks interesting and seems well balanced. Wish there was a single player aspect and story, but then again it is a TCG.

Graphics and sound are good and the game runs smoothly for me.

If you enjoy TCGs, this one may be worth trying.
It's good but its not the best.

I would recommend this game if you like card games and wanna spice things up.
HOWEVER
I would not say its worth the £15 pricetag... more like £5
The fact you can buy individual cards is ehhh

Don't get me wrong its a good game. Not as good as Hearthstone but has qualities that are better then Elder Scrolls Legends in some aspect.

Not even worth comparing this to Magic the gathering.

If you like Valve and Dota I say go for it.
If not wait for a sale, wait for the price to drop and THEN buy it.

I think its made itself a little overcomplicated with the whole 3 boarrds thing its got going. One board would of been enough but hey im not Gabe. Lets get ready for Artifact 2 and then wait an extortionate amount of time for the third game... hell maybe Half Life 3 will be out by then.
I've been playing CCG's since the mid 90's, and as a CCG, Artifact ticks all the boxes for me.  The depth, and complexity of interactions is really refreshing.  Infinite Phantom draft is a great experience for those who want to spend the initial $20 and not drop any more money on the game.
Having a blast so far. The game has an overwhelming amount of content. Monetization so far seems fair for a CCG. 
Will update the review after I have played more.
While building a deck does cost money, like almost any other card game, you can also play drafts for free forever, and you can also win packs by being good at expert drafts.
If you like TCGs, this is one of the better ones out there currently. You have to be used to the TCG model though, as you have to pay to obtain the cards and pay to play competitive (which is like playing in a local tournament). There's a few balance issues, but I trust Valve will fix them in the coming month or so.
The game is very fun, interesting, and rewarding to play. For $20 you can do infinite drafts, so it's not bad on the wallet to play with every card. The most expensive constructed decks are around $50, and you can build a tier 1 competitive deck for ~$10. Be aware that Artifact requires some investment of time to learn the game, and like all good games you will notice your skill level consistently improves and leads to more wins. Definite buy if you're on the fence!
Its mostly good game, usually im playing it with friend using call of arms decks, so u dont need to donate. Very funny when u win and ur friend becomes flaming, calling this game very random and u saying "nah its very balanced game, u lost cuz u r noob". 
For sure random factor makes really affect, if you have all 7 mana cards from the beginning, cannot make kills => no money, but its still funny!

Playing free mode with random guys makes so mixed effect: its hard to play against guy who collected own well-balanced deck, at the other hand, when u win against strong enemy,  u got very positive emotions.

I [b]recommend[/b] try this game, default decks well-balanced, but sometimes it doesn't seem so due to random.

Have Fun!
The game is fantastic and an absolute blast to play. 

The monetization model is great, with the ability to buy singles directly from the market, most for 5 cents and under. If you perfer Skinner-box models, there are plenty of other games out there to grind on. I welcome this change wholeheartedly.
Overall I'm enjoying the game, thus a thumbs up.  I'm mostly playing constructed for now so that's what I'll focus on.
I opened my original 10 packs and did not buy any more packs.  I sold a few cards I opened and sold some other game items to gather about $5 of steam dollars.  I proceeded to buy almost any common and uncommon I wanted.  I stayed away from the more expensive rares because I don't want to invest that much into a digital card yet.

By not buying the more expensive rare cards, this pushes me out of meta decks.  More importantly I will have a much harder time making a strong control and/or competative deck (no blue boardwipes, no red finisher spell, no blue finisher spell, no high cost item for a black econ ramp, no blue green combo, less competative heroes).  I focus on making agro, mid range, hero killer, and green late game decks.

This does lead to some fustrating games as you will face people with more competative cards and it can feel bad.  However this is the choice I made and I can still win (odds not in my favor).  I can't tell you how satisfying it is to win with a low budget deck against the more meta and expensive decks.
Artifact is a great new take on a TCG with Dota characters. Knowing the heroes is a nice little touch for those who play Dota 2, but anyone who doesn't know the heroes can still easily grasp what is going on and really enjoy this game. This game has a unique and challenging formatting for a card game.

First major point to discuss is the talking about how it is pay to play or pay to win. My only response to that is: Yea, of course it is? It's a TRADING CARD GAME. I don't think anyone complaining about this game understands how these games work, so let me talk about the "pay to play" and "pay to win" elements people talk about.

[h1] Pay to Play	[/h1]

This game (other than it's $20 up front price) is not pay to play at all. The tickets that you can use to play are not for competetive mode or anything else you may read in the reviews. It is mainly used for what can be called "wager matches". It is pretty much what Arena is in hearthstone. You draft or make your own deck, and you use it until you win 5 times or lose 2 times. If you can win up to 3 times, then you get your ticket refunded. Getting 4 or 5 wins will get your ticket refunded as well as give you one or two decks respectively. 

You also get tickets (and packs) to play wager mode as you level up for free. So overall, there is no pay to play aspect of this game, other than of course buying the game itself.


[h1] Pay to Win	[/h1]

So people who complain about this game playing pay to win: Every single TCG in the world is pay to win. That should have been known since it was announced. It is a pay to win game but there are some great ways that Artifact mitigates the pay to win aspect. 

[list]
    [*]All of the cards on the marketplace are EXTREMELY cheap for a TCG. The most expensive is less than $10 right now and well over half the cards in the game are only $0.05.
    [*]The complexity and rng of the game make it so even some of the best decks can lose to good decks and good decks can lose to just ok decks. This makes it feel like you always have the ability to win, even if your deck may be heavily outdrafted.
    [*]Being able to buy single cards seperate from packs is honestly the one thing every TCG needs. It makes it so if you want to design a deck, you don't need to spend $60-$100 on card packs and hope you get the cards you want like in Hearthstone.
    [*]The best decks in the game can be bought off the marketplace for only $50 or less. For these kinds of games, that is really cheap.

[/list]

Although this game is really good in my opinion there are still some issues the game has.

[h1] Pros	[/h1]

[list]
    [*]Artifact introduces players to a very unique take on card games which is challenging, yet fun to play.
    [*]Cards are insanely cheap and you can buy them individually off the market place.
    [*]The best decks can be made for a fraction of the price that you would need to pay to get the best decks in other TCG.
    [*]Tournaments are insanely fun to play with friends and there are many other modes that you can play to show off your deck building skills.
    [*]Cards actually get tweaked in order to keep the game balanced.
[/list]


[h1] Cons	[/h1]

[list]
    [*]While I have no problem with the game being $20, the game doesn't allow refunds if you complete the tutorial and accept the packs, which can be very problematic for many players.
    [*]The gameplay is very different from any other game, and some players may not like the way Artifact plays out. 
    [*]A lot of the game seems to rely on RNG even when it comes to things like what will your unit attack, or will your hero be placed where it will instantly die. 
[/list]

All in all, Valve and Richard Garfield did an amazing job in designing this game. I was really skeptical at first, especially after seeing all of the mixed reviews surrounding Artifact. I can say for certain that a lot of the negative reviews I have seen don't really give a legitimate explanation on why Artifact is bad. I can only assume a ton of Dota players thought it would be fun, without every actually playing a TCG before. If you are a fan of games like Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone, and don't mind a more challenging take on the game, then Artifact is definitely the game for you.
this is kind of a fun previoulsy i had given it a bad review given that it had no in game way to progress with cards and no in game way to communicate with your opponite. both those features have been added so im pretty hppy =]
There is no way to put a mixed review on steam so I'll give the game a positive rating for its gameplay, it really is a fantastic card game with a lot of depth and some great new mechanics, only downsides so far I've found in gameplay is the initiative system can seem unfair at times and there is no starting hand mulligan. But when it comes to how valve monetized the game it doesn't make sense for an online card game. You have to buy the game straight up, then you get 10 card packs, that is all the card packs you'll be getting for "free", the rest you have to get by using tickets, a limited resource that can be crafted by recycling 20 cards to make 1 ticket. You can use these tickets to play competitve matches, if you win 3 games, you get 1 card pack, going to a max of 5 games won with 3 card packs as your prize. Lose two times, and your run is over and you have to use a new ticket and start over again. That is the only way to earn boosters in game without paying. There is no other reward system, or dailies or anything that allows players to earn card packs over time. If Valve doesn't change this its going to die. There are some fun practice modes that allows you to use all the cards, the bots are competent for the most part, but that won't be enough to satisfy players in the long run. 

TLDR: great gameplay, bad monetization. Volvo pls fix.
Fanstastic card game!
People write negative reviews for 2 reasons: the card marketplace or the fact that this is not Half Life 3.
Card games have always been pay 2 win, just deal with it exdee.
Even tho this isn't a sequel to HL/L4D/Portal/CS or TF, it's something and i like it.

But hey kiddos look on the positive side, maybe there is a new game coming after this release (in 3 years.)
Update: So two weeks later and we now have a form of progression and social functions. Account leveling that hands out free packs and tickets up to level 16 only and there's 200 levels. I don't know if this resets weekly or not because if this is a standard one-time system then why even bother, we need weekly free tickets even if it's only one ticket. In-game chat wheel is great but I don't like the fact anyone in the world that I vs can message me on Steam Chat. Please use seperate systems like your other games use, I don't want to be spammed on Steam Chat. Overall good update with more tweaks needed.

I'm giving this game a thumbs up just because it deserves it for being the most in-depth card game on the market at the moment and it's really fun. However with that said I generally have mixed feelings about the game itself, I was skeptical about stepping into this game and with good reason too, I watched this game unfold for a week before I made my purchase. I do think the model this game uses is fine, it's a Trading Card Game in the end of the day and it does that successfully but I still have my gripes about the game and i'll speak about them as I go along.

The problem I have is that Valve didn't pick 2 things to monetize they chose 3. Base Game Price > Steam Market Card Trading > Event Tickets. If they made it so there was a way to earn free event tickets, I think the community has a whole would appreciate it. It would make the TCG crowd happy and in return the free to play CCG crowd happy too. I actually don't have a problem with buying cards off the market, I do however have a problem with purchasing event tickets.

To put things into perspective on how well a TCG system can be. I opened my 10 packs and in one of those I got Axe valued for $20 AUD. I have no reason to keep the card or need it, so I sold it for $19.10 and after tax I got back $16.61. I made back almost the full price of the game itself $27.95 AUD. Now that is something I couldn't do with a CCG even though I love them myself.

Now with all that said and done it's time for the real review. I'm a CCG player, my main two games are Yu-Gi-Oh Duel Links and Gwent. I was looking for a third card game to fill the gap because I want variety in things. None of the other CCG's caught my attention and then came along Artifact which honestly has filled that void for me.

The good and my god is there a lot of nice things to say about the game. The visuals are so pleasing to the eye, honestly such a great art direction not one thing in here looks bad and along side that is the audio jeez the music, sound effects, board everything sounds damn great and it's honestly a tie between the two. The graphics settings are pretty standard nothing amazing but nothing incredibly bad either, all I can say is it does the damn job and it's good enough. The main and honestly aside from art and audio is the gameplay it's the best feature there is, I'm in love with it so damn much! I never thought in my life playing 3 boards in one match would be so entertaining. The Dota gimmick honestly fits so well with the game and for good reason. The 3 board (lane) system probably wouldn't work so well without it, considering this is actually a moba in TCG format! 6 towers, 3 lanes, heroes, creeps, gold, shop and much more! The modes for the game so far are: Solo Play, Social Play, Casual Play and Expert Play (excluding events). Casually the game is free forever after the base price of the game which I applaud cause there's a lot to do here, vs bots, vs friends, casual constructed or phantom draft. Building decks is quite fun in the game and it's actually pretty straight forward but nothing to write home about it's like any other card game but it works and that's good.

The bad and fuck my life this is were all the gripes start to flow in. There is so much lack of features right now, no stats, no profile, no progression, no ranked, no leaderboards, no replays and event tickets are too expensive considering the win rate you need to be at for proper rewards. The game as it stands now is only to jump in and play and expect nothing else which isn't terrible but it's not gonna hold anyone for years. Aside from being able to sell your cards on the marketplace there is actually no way to trade a card with a person on Steam even though Valve has this system in place for other games. A Trading Card Game without Trading.

In the end of the day this game is fun and if you are a card game fan you'll love this whether you are a CCG or TCG player. I expect to play casual for a long time unless I see a real progression system and changes to the way event tickets are handled. I'm 100% okay with buying cards but I cannot accept a 3 way pay wall pick 2.
Actually gained money by playing this game
Kept winning in the expert play then selling cards i got from the packs
Bought 3 other games because of artifact
Money making game
Definitely paid for itself
Love it!
I have played physical TCGs in the past and this has the exact same business model, that being said, the game is actually very fun and I enjoy it quite a bit!
I've played many card games in time.  I have MTG cards from when I was 12.  I've played Hearthstone since open beta.  I design games as a hobby.

I could write all my detailed thoughts on this game but I'll try to keep it to some limited points:

1) The graphics and sound are amazing.  While it is becoming more common for card games to have an audio cue when a card is played, Artifact goes above and beyond this.  From opening cards in packs to random dialogue from heroes, this element is amazing.

2) The draft mode is amazing.  You can play a free mode or a prize mode for tickets.  Drafting is far superior to Hearthstone, both based on the format and the prizes.  I won't describe everything that makes the format awesome, but after drafting your cards you then get to craft your deck.  Thus, if you are forced to pick some really bad cards at times, you don't then have to include them in your deck later.  From the prize perspective, if you go at least 3-2 you get your ticket back.  In Hearthstone, a portion of your prize is always sunk into a pack, thus making your prize very often a discounted pack.  Here, you get nothing for really bad runs, but you always get a ticket refund on above average runs.

3) Draft games tend to be very close.  Often in other card games you tend to see a lot of polarity these days, but Artifact feels like one or two decisions can often swing the game.

4) Valve is on top of its shit.  It quickly dropped two patches within the first three weeks that greatly improved the game.  Other games would probably tend to release an announcement of the changes, but wouldn't be able to patch for another few weeks.  Valve got that s**t done quick.  They've earned a fair amount of trust from me to improve this game even further.
I normally don't write reviews as I'm usually recording content, but I felt compelled to leave my opinion (for what it's worth).

Pay to Win:
There are going to be two sides to this.  You're going to have one group of people who claim that the game is pay to win and that they won't support a game that supports a pay to win model.  On the other, you're going to have people who grew up playing Magic the Gathering and other like games and are used to dropping $3-$50 bucks a week at their local store on card packs.  My vice (when I was a kid) was Star Trek The Next Generation: The Customizable Card Game.  Starbase One, my local gaming store at the time, got hundreds of dollars from me and I never played professionally.

$20 gets you 10 packs and 5 event tickets for expert play.  You can buy additional packs for $1.99 or individual cards ranging from $.01-$21.  Personally, I found the buying and selling of individual cards to be smooth and fluid.   One specific card costs $21 at the time of writing, more than the game itself.  Does that make the game pay to win?  Probably.  I'm assuming the card isn't priced that way for aesthetics.  It CAN get expensive, but most card games of this type already are.  You're either going to hate that sort of business model or shrug it off as the norm.  There's no right or wrong viewpoint...it's just up to personal preference.  Luckily, you can play against friends and also participate in drafts, avoiding the card purchasing altogether.  My sole complaint is that there's no current way to trade cards with friends.

Yes, I'm a newbie, but I'm liking the game so far.  I learned it fairly quickly and like that it's not just a copy/paste of Hearthstone.  Sure, there are similarities, but the heroes, fountains, three lanes, and etc. makes it stand out as its own product.  I plan to keep playing and possibly purchase more cards in the future.

For game features and gameplay, check out my first game against the AI below.

I bought the game about a week after release. There was no reward system and no ranking system. In my opinion there was no goal and no joy to play it, so i stopped playing until this weeks patch.
Right now i can easygoing recommend this game to everyone! Its a lot of fun.
Sure there are better games with prettier reward system, but the fact valve react so fast to the community makes me feel good.
New update fixed these issues. It is great now.

---------------------------------
Am a casual gamer and usually don't find any need to review games.  But after playing Artifact for sometime, I needed to get this off my chest.

Pros
Yes, it is a fun game, in-depth, engaging and the mechanics make sense.

Cons
No, you don't get to win packs to add to your collection without paying real money for tickets or packs. 
It doesn't make any sense after paying 20 odd dollars for the game. 
So you're basically stucked in casual/solo mode until decide to pay for a ticket. 
We can all agree that much of the fun in any card game has to be the thrill of obtaining and getting packs(without involving real money), but it seems like the developers don't get it even after countless feedbacks. 
It is much like buying a cake with half the buttercream and toppings, and to get a complete cake you have pay for the missing buttercream and toppings. 

Balance needs work. Cards like Cheating Death make the game unplayable. 
Hourglass card blocking item needs to have its cost way up. Red cards in general needs balancing.

No profile, no ranking. You only get to chat with your opponent after the game on a separate pop up window.



It can be a really enjoyable game to play and I think the developers can still turn this around. Especially when the player count has dropped by more than half in a month. Alarming, no? 

As of now, I do not recommend this game.
I wonder if we could add ban/pick  in constructive mode ,now  constructive mode is just one deck againanother deck that you couldn't know before meeting opponent .More pertinence makse more fun . The mode used now can be reserved in the same time.
And as a  mac user, I always disconnect from the  server as my Internet connection idefinitely good .I have lost some ticket for this problem,that really disappointed  me .
The price is right. With further 20 bucks I have enough decks to have a lot of fun. I like it and look forward to more cards and a reward system. There is a lot of love and work involved here and I am sure that valve will deliver. Not to recommended for uncreative people and for those who want a second hs. 
Conclusion: Awesome game with a promising future!
I'm really enjoying Artifact so far. It feels like a genuinely new twist on the digital TCG genre. It's incredibly intense but also a lot of fun; I've been experiencing a lot of exhilarating highs when clinching a tight game and crashing lows when things don't go my way. The animation and soundtrack are both a joy to experience.

It's a very tactical game and I'd say probably more aimed at experienced TCG fans than casual players.

While I've managed to have hours of fun without paying any additional money, I do have one qualm with the Expert mode (that requires tickets to enter). I've yet to play it and the reason for that is I don't think I'd be able to get to 3 wins before 2 losses, which is the minimum you have to do to win your entry ticket back. This for me, sets the bar too high. When you consider random elements of the game, such as creep and hero placement it's quite an ask unless you have a really solid deck. For me, I think it would make more sense to award a ticket after 2 wins, even if there's no additional reward at three wins.
Now, perhaps Expert truly is only aimed at experts, who are really experienced at drafting or are willing to spend a bit of extra money to put together a perfect constructed deck. I would be perfectly happy with that, but if this is the case, then I feel they shouldn't have included tickets with a purchase of the game and lowered the cost appropriately. That would have lowered the entry barrier and made it clear that Expert is for people who want to dedicate a bit more cash to the game.
So far i love the game and i don't mind to pay for stuffs that are good quality since u can see how much details and effort this game has, there is way more expensive cards game like MTG ppls pay over 100$ at least in that game without complain, here in artifact booster cost 2 dollars which u already pay 20 to get 10 of them at start.
Last time I played a card game was over 10 years ago. As I'm typing this, the value of all my Artifact cards sits at over $100. Yes, it's an expensive game to play, but it's very fun and rewarding as well. I don't even care to buy tickets or packs. I could play global matchmaking(free) all day and have a blast.
Im honestly shit at this game but its complexity leads me to try and learn from all my mistakes.
Losing does not feel like rng bullshit like some other cardgames; simply from my errors whilst playing and I feel there is a lot higher skill ceiling in this game.
Looking forward for next expansions!

Game is quite enjoyable. If you are looking for a complex card game and willing to spend money then i think it is well worth your time. There is a marketplace where you can buy the excat cards you need and if you are on a budget there are community pauper tournies which play with the cheapest cards in the game that usually will cost you 5 cents or so. If you are looking for a free to play game with  ways to  earn free cards though this game is not for you. They offer no free cards every card you acquire costs money. So, it all just depends on your financial standing and if you think a card game is worth spending money on.
The actual game is nice.  The few problems that exist with "RNG" are fixable.  And it's not nearly as hard to learn as every other 'Fortnite' kid here says it is.

As for the economy, if I ever get so bored or 'over' the game, I can sell all my cards and buy something else on Steam.  Can't do that in Hearthstone, MTGO, or even Gwent.
People complaining about monetization, pay to win and other stuff don't know what they are talking about and are missing one of the best card game experiences ever because they wanted this to be something else that already exists.
An amazingly fun, deep card game with lots of promise for the future.

People complaining about the monetization in the game are ridiculous - being able to buy and sell single cards makes building competitive decks way cheaper than any other CCG out there. Plus if you don't care about constructed play you can play draft for free, and just selling the cards from your 10 starter packs will more than likely make you your $20 back.

Complains about the absence of visible MMR progress tracking are valid, but those are coming, and your MMR is being tracked behind the scenes, so just stay put and soon enough you'll see Number Go Higher.

Highly recommended to any CCG fan.
Highly recommended. Very interesting game mechanics and stunning astetics.
Most negative reviews here critisised the prizing model: Valve just released a new update garanteeing free packs very combined with a new leveling system and achievements.
They are also balancing cards both buffs and nerfs.

The inital prize is definitely worth it and the steam market provides very cheap measures to an entire collection.
For 10$ i bought basically half a collection and most heroes. Combine that ith free tickets and packs from the game and you will have a complete collection in no time.

This review is in no means trying to delegitimize peoples concerns and criticisms about the game,as I believe ALL criticisms are valid if they are not trying to mislead or misinform the readers.This review is NOT going to cover game play in-depth, but more about the business model, as this is the main key problem negative reviewers have.

This game, so far, seems to split the online card game community in two:

- People who prefer free card games, at which you grind for cards with no monetary pricing
  (games such as Hearthstone)

- People who prefer paid card games, at which you do not grind for cards but, instead, 
   recieve cards with a monetary pricing and a dynamic economy. 
   (games such as Artifact and  Magic: The Gathering (both online and IRL))

This, inturn, seems to put community in a stale position, as alot of what people see as a negative are seen as a positive for the other side of the community. This is seen within the pricing for the game and its dynamic economy as, for example, people who play hearthstone and enjoy the business model will see this a negative, whilst people who play Magic: The Gathering or other real-life and online titles will this a selling point for the game, people such as myself.

This is where I believe the [b] buy the genre instead the game [/b] factor comes in. As alot of these negetive reviews, which only focus on the business model,  are from people who bought this game expecting it be the EXACT same business model as hearthstone. Steam did an amazing job at insuring and informing these people that it will NOT be this way. However, these people bought the game anyway and still post negetive reviews ONLY talking about business model.
This was due to these people not researching about the games business model, nor taking the time to read about the game itself. As alot of these people bought the game because of the genre, not because of the game itself.

This game, in my opinion, has amazing gameplay and has released with next to no bugs. But for the the majority of the negetive reviews to only focus on the business model seems disingenuous to me. As these people KNEW that the game had this business model and KNEW they wouldnt like it. Yet they still post negative reviews about the featue they KNEW they wouldnt like. However, I accept and understand peoples gameplay critisms about the game, such as game play length and, to some extent, the randomness.

I still believe, however, that if people took more time into researching more about the game rather than the genre, this game would have a much larger audience and a much higher reviewer rating. Therefore, if you are a person who loves real life card games and this type of business model, I believe you will love this game.
Pros:

+Great Card Game
+Atmosphere
+Very tense and competitive game
+Very fun strategy game where decisions matter!
+Fun gamemodes!

Cons:

-If you wish to have a collection... will be somewhat expensive.
 However, prices on cards continue to lower so just hold your horses.
-Paying for draft can feel somewhat sad, like REALLY sad when you don't get anything in 
 return.
-No real way to progress in game YET.

I WANT THIS GAME TO SUCCEED! PLEASE DON"T FAIL ME VALVE!
You think you've lost. 14/5/23 enemy Sven in the first lane. You respawn Treant there to protect your ancient, fiddle phase boots and decoy to turn the -34 into a -9, enemy finally gives you initiative even if Treant dies. Clutch gust in lane 2 to salvage the situation.


You think you've won. Blink treant mid with 5 allies, empty enemy side. Opponent respawns 4 heroes mid, roars 2 of your heroes to 3rd lane, and back to the drawing board.


You think you've lost. But equip Abaddon Lycan in 3rd lane. Respawn Drow in first lane. Play a dork to block Sven's fatal damage. You have a killer play in 3rd lane.


You think you've won. But enemy plays siege, Sven has fatal again. You're forced to play your 25/25 to block which would otherwise have won on 3rd lane. Mid is losing hard but you're biding time with a second Cheating Death.


You're not exactly sure what's going on anymore. Then your opponent surrenders.
The only time i've ever played a card game that made my heart pound as it was drawing to a conclusion. This is the best card game I have ever played. 

Monetization model concerns are coming from people who accidentally waste their first few tickets on Keeper Draft, as I did. Playing Phantom Draft is the way to go. At least as long as there is no ranked ladder. I will be playing this game for the next ten years, I am sure of it.
Good game, cheaper then magic bot can not be grinded like HearthStone. If you are willing to put a good 60-70 dollars in the game(witch is cheaper then some big games), you will have the best time of your life and the skill cap is insane.
Defenetly recommend for serious players.
Uniquely deep and satisfying gameplay. Slick, intuitive interface. The best variety of play modes of any digital TCG: AI, social, casual, and expert constructed and drafts; tournaments as well.

No, this game is not pay to win. Like with any paper trading card game, you get started by purchasing a starter pack (the $20 game in this case). What you get is pretty generous: $20 worth of boosters, 2 free decks, and 5 event tickets good for 5 phantom drafts where you can win more packs and tickets. And like any other TCG, you expand your collection by purchasing boosters.

Rarity is not correlated with power, so you don't need to buy tons of packs to be competitive.

And like all good TCGs, your cards actually have significant real world value, and can be traded on a market. This is super refreshing compared to grindy games like Hearthstone where you cards are only worth 1/4 of their value as dust, so when a new set comes out you have to spend a lot of money to keep up (or grind hundreds of hours).
To start, Artifact is an incredible game.  There seems to be a large basis of people complaining that this game costs too much.  In reality it is probably one of the cheapest card games i have ever played when it comes to building and owning a competitive deck. I have been playing MTG for well over 5 years and typically a high end competitive deck will range easily into the $250+ range.  Currently the most expensive card in the game is Axe and its valued around $16.  Keep in mind you can only have one of that card in your deck.  A fully competitive deck will cost you around $30, or, you can build whatever you please and just have fun.  On top of this there are a vast amount of 100% free gamemodes where having a irl investment means nothing (ex. draft and call to arms).  

Another large majority of people are complaining about the initial $20 cost to even play the game.  If you break down that cost and what you get out of it you will see that you instantly get your money back with in game cards.  To start with your $20 purchase you automatically get;

-5 entry tickets valued at $4.95
-10 booster packs (containing 12 cards in each pack) each valued at $2 a pack
-two whole starter decks filled with cards and heros

Right there you got atleast $25 of value from your initial purchase.  Keep in mind you can sell any cards you do not like, or, if you are lucky and pull an Axe or two out of your initial packs you almost payed back the entire cost of the game.

Another huge aspect about this game and any other card game is the trading and card marketplace.  Valve's in game system to purchase individual cards in one fell swoop is so well made.  Currently the market value for cards rise and fall so frequently that if you try and purchase a large set of cards you may not be able to acquire them all at once, just try again with the new updated price (typically the card value goes up and down by meer pennies).

If you want a "free" game that only revolves around rng pack opening and no ability to purchase and build decks instantly that you see twitch streamers using then go back to hearthstone.  If you have a large budget and not care about spending a large sum of money to have a competitive deck, then go to MTG.
It's not a F2P DTCG. It's like paper Magic without the benefit of physically owning and holding the cards. Also like Magic, it's essentially a "pay to play well" experience. And all of the tournament trappings are great on paper, but require you to have friends or active groups to take advantage of. 

That said, it's damn fun, deep, and feels remarkably like a match of Dota in card form. The wide open community market for cards works out the same as using *insert card website here* to order up the cards you need for a deck you're building, but then you don't have to wait for shipping to jump in and play with them. 

Equipping your heroes, carefully positioning them and planning ahead to open up opportunities for playing like-colored cards, and even knowing when it might be best to teleport them back to the Fountain for redeployment creates lots of depth and variety in matches. There's a lot here, and fans of TCGs digital or otherwise will feel right at home. 


alot potential, 

draft game shall be promoted more and constructed mode shall not be the prioritized mode

Gameplay wise:
- Early deployment need rework, not neccesary to remove RNG factor but need more consistent variables
- Item shop mechanic need rework, please add more consistent variable like 5 items to be chosen from instead of 3
- Same hero during draft shall be banned as well, apparently imbalanced draft like 3 bristleback and 3 drow ranger have very little counter to deal with

Overall Score: 3/5
Draft mode is great. If Valve keep improving the constructed mode and implement ranked soon I'm sure the game will be a lot of fun for a very long time to come. 

Crashes.  Still I love playing it for short bursts and it wont crash if you play just one game.  Probably a memory leak.  Yet it's still enjoyable.  You will come back to it again and again.  I know I have
First off, I feel I should mention the fact that I feel like most people are currently looking at artifact the wrong way. The game is in a sense free, the cards are not. When you buy the game you get 10 packs (real packs too, not some kind of starter crap bullshit, the cards you open equate to real money) which equates to 20 dollars, the exact price of the game, not only that, but you also get 5 tickets to try out some of the risk-reward paid game modes. All paid game modes also have a free version with the only difference being that there are no rewards or incentives to play other than having fun. 

As for the gameplay. Currently, the core constructed mode is extremely well thought out and balanced. While some cards to exist which I personally feel to be a tad overpowered, the overall mechanics and gameplay Artifact offers is so deep, complex, rich, and every other good adjective I can think of. Never before have I played a card game with so many separate mechanics that flow together so nicely. I'm not gonna go into detail but I promise, this is one hell of a well thought out and fun game. Also, it feels like a mob, so there's that lol.

I would also like to mention that the draft mode is actually phenomenal, not only are you free to play as much of it as you want, but it's so exceptionally well made and entertaining I found myself playing it straight for multiple hours, despite this game having no actual incentive or progression as of yet.

Lastly, onto the economy. I personally prefer it over the economy of any other online card game. While cards for an artifact can range currently to over 15 dollars (looking at you Axe), most care cost mere pennies and you can get around 90 percent of the current set for just around 20 dollars, which is absolutely insane. The rest of the cards you could want you can simply purchase for a few bucks more and boom you're basically done, you can jump into competitive without a second thought. Unlike other online card games where you pay for the chance to get what you want, here you have the option to do so, however, if you don't like paying for chances, you can just fork over the money for the specific cards you want.

Overall, how do I feel about this game? Personally, I consider it to be the best all-around online card game I've played thus far, and this is coming from a man who has put in over 7 thousand hours in Hearthstone and two thousand hours in Gwent. My only main complaint is that I'm playing a game with legitimately no progression at all. What game forgets to put some form of incentive to play it? I can recommend it based on the gameplay and how fun the matches are, however some serious changes need to be made if the valve wants this game to last and appeal to players. I understand that free cards can be given as rewards for playing the game, as it would completely destroy the economy, however, I do believe some form of progression or tasks can be added. Things like untradable alternate card art unlock, new boards, card backs, a ladder system, a profile system in which you can show off your decks or favorite cards and such. Just look at what Gwent did for rewards and ignore how they give out backs but look at everything else, its very well done and I think those simple changes would make the biggest difference in the current feel of the game, as at the moment I'm only playing it based off of how much I like it.
This game has a JC Penny problem, where they created a pricing model that is actually beneficial to consumers, but the consumers are so addicted to exploitative models that they actually believe they are being ripped off.

There are several misconceptions about the pricing that I'll cover here.

#1: No rewards: It's true that there's nothing to earn in this game, and that's arguably one of its best aspects. This game decided not to put players in a skinner box and be more upfront with the cost of cards. If there were free rewards being handed out, people could create extra accounts to milk them and scum the market, destroying the value of all collections. The point of having a collection of value, allows you to trade the cards you don't play for cards of similar values. This allows you to piece together meta decks on a budget, and ultimately is a far cheaper system then Hearthstone/Shadowverse. Instead of grinding in-game currency for months on end just to get one rare card, this game instead asks you to play for the fun of it and hands you draft mode right off the bat. If you play games for their progression systems rather than the content, you might have to ask yourself why you play at all.

#2: You have to pay to play after buying the game: This is blatantly false. Arguably the most engaging feature of card games is draft, and you can play that infinitely for free here. This is easily worth the price of admission alone in my opinion. For constructed, there is a menu for free play that matches you up with random players of a hidden elo/mmr. You can also play directly with your friends easily, and even use their decks! It's as if your friend handed you their deck from across the table like any other CCG. This is a first for an online card game and really allows you to get more out of your collection. The only thing you would have to pay for is $1.25 for a ticket that allows you to attempt to win 5 games without losing two, and gives you prizes for winning 3+. It's pretty easy to win at least three, and that refunds you the ticket! Anything more wins you packs in addition to a ticket, so it's really simple to stretch value out of that ticket if you do decide to pay. You could additionally buy 20 cards that cost five cents, and turn them into a ticket, costing you only a dollar. This price is really reasonable, and maintains the value of everyone's collection as it gives the cards you could win a price.

#3: This game is expensive: Reporters have mathed out that you could buy every copy of every card in the game for $300. This is an amazing deal for a CCG but it is also a ridiculous hypothetical. No player needs every card to be competitive, and you start with a serious chunk at the outset.
There is a serious force that keep prices in check as well; every pack of cards contains at least one card of the highest rarity. So the supply of rare cards is large enough that they have a hard limit on how high their price can climb. For the history of this game this feature is intended to keep meta deck prices (from scratch) within $30 - $50. Compare this to Magic where meta decks can cost hundreds.
But the most important thing to note about this is you can straight up trade cards you already have FOR 85% OF THEIR MARKET VALUE. Compare that to dusting systems in other card games that likely give you 1/8th to 1/10th of the currency (that you can only spend within that game). New card set coming out? Sell them for money, and snipe the meta cards with it. Your collection will depreciate orders of magnitude less than say Hearthstone or Shadowverse where a new set drops the value of your collection by nearly exactly the ratio of new cards introduced. This is because you can't trade or sell those cards, period.

If you haven't gathered by now, I see this monitization as a fair and positive development in the loot-box skinner-box paradigm we're normally subjected to. And if you think of the pros it offers, and why they made the decision to try it as opposed to proven methods, I hope you'll see it that way too.

Finally I have to mention what's bringing people to this game in the first place. The gameplay is not a 'dumbed down for mobile' spin on CCGs. It takes advantage of mechanics that could only work in digital to add interesting decisions - instead of adding excessive randomness to generate hype youtube compilations. What you are left with is something that could potentially rival Magic in a few sets, finally bringing the best aspects of card games into the modern era.

I'm obviously really excited about this game, and I hope people give it a fair chance to succeed.
Amazing mechanics, incredibly deep game. Easily the best TCG out thereand with a lot of room to grow. The economy may be a limiting factor for some, but you can easily build a 9/10 deck for like $20. There are really only a handful of cards driving the market up, and those will go down with time as supply increases.
It's good game. There is some rng, like in every card gane and one rly broken card (yes Im looking at you fake death). But the base game and rules are pretty good.

 Does the game needs more cards?
Yes, absolutely. Its not such fun play against 4 archetype decks in constructed. But thats something what can be changed with new expansion.

Price of the game...20 bucks WTF?
Game costs 20 dollars thats true, but you get 10 packs worth 20 dollars and 5 event tickets worth 5 dollars...together 25 dollars goods.
Plus some basic cards which are actualy worth nothing, cause everybody has them, but hey you can still play them.

Do you need to pay to grow your collection?
That depends on your skill and luck. You can play constructed and phantom drafts (1 ticket) to win boosters and ticket back. When you have 5 boosters go to keeper draft. After that you can recycle your cards into event tickets (20 cards = 1 ticket). Anything worth more than 5 cents is better to sell on marketplace. So if you are good enaugh you can go infinetely like that, growing your collection and not spending money.

Valve is silent do they still care about the game?
That is valid point. Lets just hope for the best.

Is there are randomness in Artifact?
Yes, there is, but it can be manipulated. Just that fake death again:-((

And what about playerbase?
Playerbase dropped drasticaly since launch. But I dont have problems to find opponents within seconds, even when I have 4-0.



Overall Artifact is a great game with some problems, but those can be fixed. To be good in this game you need skill, know how and of course little luck...but mostly skill.

P.s.: Hey Valve. I think, that creeps and heroes should attack just straight if not manipulated by card or abbility. And do something with stupid fake death🤨. Thank you


Game mechanics are fine, I have no problem with monetization model (it's TCG, not CCG), but I hope Valve will deliver soon missing features like statistics, ladders, game replays, chat etc. And we don't know anything about rotation and what to expect next, Valve should really end their silence.
THERE IS NO MONETIZATION PROBLEM

Ppl dont seem to realize all the fun that can be done for free (after paying the initial 20 dollars). Unlimited free gauntlet drafting. Unlimited draft tournaments. In game build tournament setups where you set the rules. I have been playing so many custom made tournaments that didnt require a single card with people i do not know. I feel like people ar severly misinformed. 

So what do you have to pay for? Gauntlets with prizes and card packs if you want to go constructed. I spent 150 dollars and now i have all the meta decks. A lot of money but also a lot of meta decks i cant make. And i mean a lot. But guess what? I still mostly play the free draft tournaments. I dont see a reason to enter a tournament for money. I played 50h and perhaps 4-5 of them has been constructed play (in which you need own cards aka have bought packs/cards on the market). I am no way near done with this game. 20 dollars has given me 40 "free" hours and i have only started with this game. Compare that to God of War, which is great, and i paid 3x the amounth and pretty much cant play more than 40h.

The game, yeah its great :) Easilly the best card game i have ever played. 

(beta access received for free from a friend)
Free draft and affordable commons to have fun with building decks. Don't bother if you want to play the strongest decks in competition. Best game to draft and play with friends.

€: I'd propably still buy the game but apart from the player numbers there are a number of issues with the game. 

while you can still have fun with free Draft and common/uncommons decks you WILL get stomped by expensive cards. Axe, Time of Triumph, Annihilation and more are just insanely strong and will win the majority of games simply by being played.

I got my moneys worth but sadly it's not the card game I had imagined it to be.
Tons of fun. Don't believe the trolls screaming about monetization. This is one of the best economies I've seen in a TCG and the market is already starting to drop with all the cards out there. Played for 6 hours today without spending a dime and can continue to do that until I want to play constructed. 

As far as TCGs go this is a great model.
An amazing and deep card game that has the typical Valve polish you can expect. The game isn't perfect but so far is having an amazing start. A breath of fresh air from other card games out there.

Longer Video Review►►https://youtu.be/tYLycwQ0lEU
Incredibly in-depth with groundbreaking mechanics. I personally consider Artifact a masterpiece and to me it's a spiritual successor of Mojang's Scrolls. Some important features are missing on launch - some unexpected are there now (tournament system), but what matters is the gameplay and that's a masterpiece
I'd spend 27 bucks on the soundtrack alone. It must've taken hours upon hours to craft the music for this game, it's brilliant.

As for the game, I love it so much. The animations, the playstyle, the way initiative works, the items, heroes... This can easily be the greatest TCG the world will ever see as long as Valve doesn't get too greedy with it. Speaking of which, do you guys really need the money?

Anyway, love the game and happy with my purchase. Wish the matchmaking was a little more even, but even in defeat I love the battle to the bitter end!

I only wish the community market wasn't in the game. It makes constructed worse since trash players can just buy the best cards and net deck super easily.
A throwback to the traditional TCG era. The complexity of Artifact in a very competitive card game market is extremely refreshing. There are still various improvements that Valve can do to make the game better and I do hope that Valve will make it accessible to everyone so that they can experience how good this game actually is.
Some of the most interesting card dynamics and combination pathways I have ever seen or contemplated in a collectible AND tradeable card game.   I might be suffering from confirmation bias due to my fondness of Dota.
Revised.  I previously rated this poorly but they have implemented what I'm looking for.  The business model is not for everyone and despite changing this review to a recommend, it's fair to say the model is bad.  The game itself is fun and the recent changes gave it some longer term enjoyment that it sorely needed.
OK guys, now to all those that hate this game and make others hate it, shoo your ruining this game for others.

Now for my review, in my own opinion I love artifact as well as hearthstone  which artifact will hopefully be a TCG and hearthstone is a CCG
I can definitely say that this game is worth it and if you think it isn't then don't come here to argue that its bad, sure make a review like me if you want but stop going onto the discussions and telling everyone not to buy it.

Personally I love the theme music at the start of each game and the sounds of cards being put down and the strategy used each turn makes this game fun


In the the end I've come to love artifact and those who like it as well comment down what you like about it
That's like chess and dice and card games had a baby and Artifact was born.

There is stupid amount of randomness but when you play it consistently, results always show up.

Also because of the skill rating system it guarantees that you will find players of your level of skill or luck every time and butthurt insures even on the won matches.
Very compelling gameplay. The game forces you to think ahead in terms of turn order, hero positioning (between the 3 "boards"), and resource management if you want to edge out your opponents. Very few games are blowouts, a testament to the overall balance of the game. However, don't expect a very good f2p experience if you want to get into constructed play. Considering it is the first day the game came out, the market can be somewhat volatile. Expect the card prices to stabilize once the market gets saturated enough.
I really like the game, it plays kinda like chess where you have to think ahead your plays, and also, each card played opens up new posibilities every time, also the rng makes each game different and after each match, if you lose, you realize that you could have played it differently to win, it is highly skill based due to this fact. Also, to those complaining that this game is pay to win, i bet that in all other card games if you want the best deck every time, you have to have all the cards, and artifact is the cheapest of them. Also, if you are a really skilled player, after you pay the initial fee, you can get packs and cash prizes through tournaments and won't need to pay for packs after that. PS: Draft mode is very fun and challenging.
Extremely well made card game, tons of strategic depth and fun. Cheaper to be competitive in than almost all other card games. Playing casually is more difficult since there isn't any free progression, but if you are good at draft then you should be able to stretch out your investment.
Highly recommended since patch 1.2 which added rewards, progression, and social features on top of the existing solid gameplay.

Definitely worth playing, especially if you enjoy drafting.
I'm not surprised by all the hate this game is receiving considering how people can't think for themselves once the herd has come to a conclusion haha... 

Artifact was intimidating at first. There are plenty of variables to contend with at any given time. Although, it's skill intensive, a noob can still get into it no problem. I've already spent 8 hours playing since launch and half of those games were with my friend. I even lost a good amount of them and still had boatloads of fun. 

If you're concerned about the monitization aspect of this game, have no fear. The majority of the cards are selling for pennies. Don't forget the basic rule in life: Time = Money. Would you rather grind for 20 hours to unlock a card or spend $0.10 for the EXACT card you wanted?! Allowing such flexibility has allowed me to craft a bunch of meme decks that I previously couldn't have considered.

If that's not enough, you get the option of using premade decks (that likely include cards you don't have), which are just as fun. 

If you are a casual gamer that wants to get into a card game without spending a ton of money, I'd highly recommend this game.
Typical Artifact Conversation.  A short performance.

NormalPerson: This new TCG looks pretty cool.
KneeJerkReactioneer: Yea, it looks alright but I hate the monetization.
NormalPerson: It is $20 to play.  What's wrong with that?
KneeJerkReactioneer: But you have to pay for cards.
NormalPerson: You don't have to pay for cards though.  There's tons of ways to play without buying cards.
KneeJerkReactioneer: But you have to pay for cards.
NormalPerson: If you really want to get cards, you can get them without paying if you are good enough at the fundamental game.
KneeJerkReactioneer: But you have to pay for cards.
NormalPerson: Again you don't [i]have[/i] to pay for cards, but the option is there.
KneeJerkReactioneer: LOL SEE IT'S PAY 2 WIN

The End


Seriously though, its a good game.
Pros:
-Surprisingly complex gameplay arises from a few simple mechanics
-Interesting new take on the TCG system
-The game overall is fun

Cons:
-The random system determining creep lanes, sometimes attacking corners, and creep/hero placement makes strategizing properly impossible
-Pay to play

The monetization works. Ive spent about 50 bucks on cards so far and have several powerful decks to choose from, all direct buys from steam market, and the 10 free packs you get with the game purchase. If you have ever been into a CCG at a serious level, this really should'nt bother you. The interface and deck builder are very slick and well designed. Creating decks, or ripping off an opponents deck that scraped you is easy. 

The layers of strategy and combinations of heros will keep you busy and thinking for hours and hours. You can play the same deck vs the same deck all day and have 100 different outcomes. Visit the deck builder and make your own tweaks that fit your playstyle or harness the strength of your deck, or make up for short comings through the seperate item deck. The level of depth here really is robust. The 3 lane design is amazing, albeit a bit overwhelming at first. Nevertheless, keep playing games and it will have a familiar feel, and lends a wonderful flow to the game.

The games visuals are phenomenal for this type of game. Valve did an amazing job with creating a unique feeling setting that fits the atmosphere perfectly. The little deck imps that deal your cards are animated and cute, and all the cards have original artwork and are fully VOICE ACTED! I can't wait for expansion decks.

Que times are under 10 seconds for casual play, and bot matches are no joke. There are tournaments for entry fee, 5 are included in the purchase price. This game is perfect for the casual and the hardcore alike. You want to have a chill game? Load up a bot match, they are as good or better than real opponents. Build the ultimate unstoppable force with an answer for everything? Try your luck in a tourney. There is even "Keeper Draft" where you choose the cards you want to play with, even ones you don't own and KEEP the cards! AMAZING!

The way I see it, 20 bucks gets you this amazing game, and they include 10 packs of cards to get you started. Packs are 2 dollars a piece, so youre basicly paying to kick-start your deck. People want everything for free these days, whining about purchasing cards in a collectible card game is like whining that after you buy a vehicle you have to keep putting gas in it. As well you can direct purchase the cards you want, and if you decide you dont like the deck, you can then sell the same cards back on the market place and retrieve some of your investment. Thats just what this game is, an investment. Same as any other card game. At the end of the day it's a COLLECTION, once you own the big ticket cards, you never have to buy them again.

If you like MTG, Pokemon, Yu GI OH, or anything of the like, this game is DEFINATELY for you. No more card sleeves, and losing cards between the couch cushions. No more rows and rows of binders full of cards. Everything is at your fingertips with filters, a market, a deck builder and even code to copy and paste a deck directly, even an opponents deck after the match ends.
Buy cards, build decks, win games.

I've been playing tangible CCG's for almost 20 years and in my humble opinion, this game is even greater than MTG.

Artifact 10/10 would HIGHLY reccomend
Artifact is a very intelligently designed card game and feels great to play; more like a turn-based strategy game than a TCG. It's mechanics feel very unique and different to Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone or Elder Scrolls: Legends. The art, animations and sound design are all tight and crisp (although a "quick animations" mode would be appreciated).

For the price (which is around a similar cost to a real world MTG core set) you get a bunch of trial decks to use for free, 10 boosters to start your own collection and 5 event tickets. You also get access to solo play (using owned cards only), a constructed mode (using owned cards) and a free draft mode (which allows the use of every card, but you don't get to keep any). The game desperately needs a way to earn anything (cards/levels/cosmetics) in-game to give that progression feeling that other digital TCGs have, but I don't feel the current model is in any way unfair.

They should probably add a list of card probabilities for the booster packs so people know exactly what they're buying into. That being said, most of the cards (even the heroes) don't cost much on the market - I fleshed my collection out with the loose change I got from selling my duplicates on the market.

I would like to see a solo phantom draft mode implemented. Further down the line I would support the addition of more solo content, perhaps even a story/challenge mode, because I feel the game lends itself more to that than to competitive play.
The learning curve is substantial, but the mechanics are incredibly engaging and fun; especially since the dev team has reversed their position on card balancing (good call my dudes). 

Each game requires your full attention and feels far more skill based than contemporaries such as hearthstone. Even a relatively weak deck can prevail with proper planning and deployment of your heroes. A pay to win aspect is present, as with any TCG, but it’s effects feel muted because of how impactful some of the staple heroes are and how much thought goes into something as simple as passing for initiative.

Most of my frustration early on came from a lack of understanding regarding the numerous keywords and how certain mechanics interact (looking at you regeneration when calculating combat damage) but that’s just part of the curve.  If you can get past some confusion early on, you’re in for one of the most satisfying card game experiences on the market.
Really enjoying the game, draft mode is free and that was the part I wanted most to play most.  I like dota characters and the card game really offers something different in that hero units are needed to cast spells.  This means rather than a fixed mana curve like hs or a random system like MTG, you can deny the enemy or secure your own ability to play cards by tailoring your deck to kill their heroes or keep yours alive.

The whole lanes thing really doesn't take that long to get used to and choosing which to deploy in really opens up a lot of options for come backs and to fake people out.

Anyone, as someone that likes dota and card games, maybe I was doomed/destined to like this game.  Still, it makes me happy -- I had sold my initial rare cards for 5$, since I just wanted to play draft and I really didn't think I'd bother with constructed.  It's a really nice game if you have a discord group or others that are playing with it, due to their easy self run tourney system... but if you don't you might get bored, since things like chat or emotes to the enemy aren't there yet and the skill tracking is all behind the scenes.
I can trully recommend this game for mature audience mostly.
It is deep, complex and makes your brain sweat most of the time.
Its great if you are looking for something no straight forward.

Much less RNGbased game than HS, but mistakes much more punishing.
7-8/10 in my opinion.
amazing game and probably the best card game out there.
 people bitching about the business model are forgetting, that the publisher always has a way ingame to earn money and valve's cut is small compared to other games. also you have the steram market to buy cards
The last update corrected every major flaw the game had, even though there is still room for improvement.

I understand why people gave this game negative reviews. In a sense I am glad for it because it made Valve rethink their approach to business model and balancing. But I dont think today's 53% positive reviews is a good indicator to inform people whether they should buy the game or not.

As said previously, the two major flaws the game had have been corrected.
Now, cards can be modified by the developpers to nerf overpowered ones or improve bad ones. As a result, the viable decks are more numerous and diverse.
15 cards packs and tickets can be won without any additional cost, for each set (the first set currently available, and the future sets). The 15 packs/tickets to win require you to play regularly, but not to grind the game for ages. I think this system is good because it does not destroy the value of cards, and it did not transform the game into a grindfest.

Besides balancing and business model, the game itself is really good. It is really fun and interesting to play. The overall graphical and sound quality is good.
Friendly Reminder: You must have steam guard active on your mobile phone for 7 days for you to be able to buy/sell cards in marketplace. Do NOT claim free packs and tickets if you want to refund the game. If you can't refund nonetheless, submit a ticket to steam support.

Review:
Interesting game. Only way to get free packs is to play experts mode which costs 1 ticket to play. Players also have to win at least 3 times to get a ticket back, 4 times to get 1 ticket and 1 pack, 5 times to get 1 ticket and 2 pack. Social play is so much fun especially when you have banters with your friends while playing. Casual play gives no rewards but it's free, making it a great practice ground before playing experts mode. RNG in the game are okay, simply because most RNGs can be played around with spells or abilities. Economy is much like other valve games, people who have played a valve game and used the marketplace will be more familiar with the economy. 



In short, this is a game for real-life trading card games (keep in mind trading is unavailable for now, possibly enabled in the future). Do NOT buy this game if you are looking for easy card game. This is probably one of the most deeply strategical card game ever. With that said, give this game a try and see if you like it or not. just remember about the friendly reminder above.

Edited: VALVE ADDED FREE WAYS TO GET CARD PACKS AND COSMETICS. NEW RANKED SYSTEM THAT RESETS EVERY SEASON. ACTUALLY NERFED BROKEN CARDS AND BUFFS CARDS IN THE NEW UPDATE. GAME IS NOW VERY RECOMMENDED TO PLAY TO EVERY POTENTIAL PLAYERS.
Intially, I was disliking this game.  I got 10 card packs, and based off of the value that cards are on the market, I got some garbage cards (total value of my 200 cards was around $4.50 where expected value is $15 or so).  So that randomness screwed me over.

The gameplay was pretty frustrating at first, and I was considering refunding.  I feel like I am starting to get some strategy though.  This seems like the sort of game that will have an extremely long learning curve.

The monetization is a turn off, but there are multiple game modes where you don't need purchased cards.  You don't really have to have a deck of your own unless you want to do the "Expert Play" game mode.  $20 seems like a fair price for the free modes because you should easily get 10-100 hours of gameplay out of it.
Just here to offset the negatives. YES, you don't get in game currency to get free packs. But after opening up my packs, guess how much it cost me to finish my first deck. $2.75. That's even with current launch inflation prices. The only two cards that are obscene are Axe and the ranger wannabe Sylvanis. Those will likely drop in value as time goes on, have fun messing with the heroes you get. 

Are you interested in how the game plays?
Here's the tutorial video that breaks it down pretty well.
https://youtu.be/zmUFMN5DQh8
Best Card Game I played. Draft Mode is free to play forever. Constructed is where Pay to Play/Win cenario occurs. But Commons and uncommons collection is reasonably priced in steam market. Playing Pauper and Peasant with friends is very fun. When it come to game play this game is 10 times better than Hearthstone. Requires Brain to play. Every decision matters. 

But game is missing a lot of features like Spectator Mode, In game chat, Open tournament, Replay system like Dota 2. Lack of  1 v 1 Draft mode increased my steam friend list though ;P

I hope Volvo impliments these features asap. Must Play with Friends.
Played Mojang's Scrolls, Scrolls died.
Played Duelyst, Duelyst pretty much died.
Played Artifact..

👍:
- Complex gameplay that's satisfying when you manage to pull off a win from behind or even when you lose by a hair
- Unlimited casual draft and rotating preconstructed deck events
- Mistakes can be punishing but also oddly entertaining and educational
- Bots aren't too bad, maybe they can have a bot vs bot mode as a deck construction aide
- Fully voiced lore lines and the occasional quips are charming

👎:
- While you can find people to play pauper decks with it's not quite the same as other digital TCG/CCg entries, accessibility is purely pay-gated past the starter booster packs that come with the base game
- Balance seems to be foregone for the preservation of market value/rarity right out of the gate
- At this point no casual draft with friends
- Complete absence of social features currently implemented at launch makes it seem like Early Access-itis designed to give developers more breathing room, one could argue a delay might have served better just to iron out all the issues with missing features
- Could be priced lower
This game is amazing. It reminds me of old school M:TG. So many close games where you have to make just the right move at the right time to win. Endless possibilities for bulding decks. Most importantly, it is FUN.

For everyone complaining about the price. For the 20 dollars you get 10 packs of cards and 5 tickets (as well as some free cards that everyone gets). You can make an okay deck from these starting cards. I tried and won some games in casual matchmaking with it. 

You can also play "Phantom Draft" for free, which is where you draft a deck from packs of cards (not the cards you own), and you play between 2 and 6 games with this deck. You do not get to keep these cards after that. This was my favorite way to play M:TG and it is amazing that they offer it for free here. 

You can also play "Expert Phantom Draft" with your tickets, and if you get more than 3 wins you win packs as a reward and get your ticket back. I am still on my starting 5 tickets and already won 4 packs of cards. I have not spent any money on this game yet except the buy-in price.

You can sell your cards on the market, or recycle your extras for more tickets. You can buy any card you need on the market directly instead of them forcing you to buy packs. Over 90% of the cards cost less than a dollar on the market (and many cost only a few cents). This game has one of the best monetization systems i have ever seen in a card game.

Here are the cons, there are a few.

- Missing any kind of in game chat or community, although this may be a feature to keep it less toxic than dota...

- No progression system. You don't gain levels, there are no quests. Just the game played for the fun of it (and it is fun)

- No profile. No badges, no shiny anything.

- No tracking of wins/losses or any stats at all. This one really sucks, i am used to all the stats we can get from dota.

As this game is brand new, I fully expect that Valve will add all of these features in the future. Dota 2 changed a lot since it first came out, and this will grow too. Even as this game is right now i would highly reccomend it if you enjoy M:TG or any similar games.
A great card game with some cool new ideas. I do not like the fact that I can't trade cards with a friends or that I have to buy a ticket just to have the chance to maybe win some good cards. Fun, but most definitely P2W.
If you are into complex, grand strategy games, this is the card game for you.

To address the p2w controversy surrounding the game, it takes the idea from physical card games. I original grew up with physical card games, so it's pretty cool I could focus on getting specific cards from the market for only a few cents, as oppose to buy hundreds of card packs to get a specific card. Trade between players would be a great addition for this mentality, that I'm sure will be implemented soon. 

The gripes I have with the game is that it is hard to pick up if you are new, and the tutorial needs more work to explain the game for new players. Focussing on a single lane could be a great start to know the basics, but it takes away what makes this game artifact. Either way, there is a lot happening at once.
I'm not entirely sure why people are complaining about the economic model... the first set is already cheaper than Hearthstone's and will only fall in value (so it is cheaper to buy a  full set) as time goes on and people sell more and more cards on the open market.

Other than that, game is great IMO.
Needs a lot of extra features like progression system, social interaction with opponents, ways to grind cards, etc etc... Yet the game itself is actually really fun and has complex strategies, you can play draft mode if you don't want to spend for more cards. Personally, I feel that purchasing cards isn't so bad since it's like any normal TCG albeit with virtual cards, which in the end, hold the kinda the same value as physical cardboard cutouts ;b (still would be excellent to have a way to grind for cards). Either way, game is really fun and I'm sure that it'll get better with time, as long as more features keep getting implemented!
Artifact is an incredibly well made card game that has earned a poor reputation because of a misinformed public reception of the pricing model. I will do my best to convey how well designed the gameplay and its surrounding elements are while attempting to explain what makes the pricing model reasonable.

Artifact is a collaboration between Valve and Richard Garfield; the creator of Magic: The Gathering which is almost certaintly the best trading card game ever made. Artifact comes from Garfield's desire to make a game that could truly only be played in a digital format, where mechanics that would be too cumbersome in paper based games can be done to their full potential. Artifact represents a game of Dota 2, in that each game is fought over three boards (lanes) which is populated by creeps and each deck contains five hero cards which are the primary elements that determine how your deck will function, from the colours it uses from the archetype it fulfills, to what supporting cards you can play. The main goal is two either deal 40 damage to the opponent's tower in two lanes, or a total of 120 damage in one before your opponent.

The game has launched with the 'Call to Arms' set, which chronicles the leadup to the conflct of three factions of the Dota world. Every card in the game has 1-3 paragraphs of fully voice acted lore. This demonstrates an incredible attention to detail from the team and it's ineresting to see them prioritise worldbuilding in a card game, which I suppose is well facilitated by the Dota 2 flavour, giving it purpose besides the immediate three boards parallel. Many cards also feature voice acting upon being played similarly to Hearthstone and other digital card games, but Artifact's cards also feature voice lines unique to certain circumstances. For instance if two cards representing characters from warring factions are played, one may comment on what strange times they are living in. Each card, particularly the hero cards feature stunningly beautiful artwork from well known artists, some even with experience making art for Magic: The Gathering.

Artifact's pricing model is more fair than its Steam reviews would lead you to believe. For $20USD you get 10 packs of cards and 5 event tickets (valued at a total of $25USD, although the estimated price of a pack is currently closer to $2.80USD due to demand for cards in the Steam Marketplace). Event tickets can be used to enter gauntlets, which facilitate constructed and draft formats and offer the prospect of earning your ticket back if you come out with a 60% or better winrate. Tickets can also be gained by recycling 20 cards from your collection, giving use to what might be considered 'draft chaff' or just cards you don't want. Cards can also be purchased on the Steam Market in order to avoid the need to grind packs in order to find the card you want, although I would recommend waiting for a week or so after launch to see if prices go down on some cards. If players do not wish to spend money on tickets there are free alternatives to the constructed and draft gauntlets, though they do not offer rewards for any kind of high winrate. This means that players can play draft, for free, forever after their initial purchase. There is also currently the Call to Arms preconstructed gauntlet challange. In which players can choose a preconstruced deck featuring archetypes of the Call to Arms set and be matched against other players using other preconstructed decks. This gauntlet challenge is currently free and provides a great gameplay alternative to the typical draft and constructed formats. Hopefully Valve can maintain this level of interest and quality with the future challenges that they are planning to introduce.

Artifact is an excellently designed digital card game that features incredible levels of detail and worldbuilding that some may not expect from a card game. All this being said, some suggestions I have include:

Introduce player profiles, similar to Dota 2. Allow me to feature cards or decks that I really like  and allow me to display the amount of perfect runs I have. This ties into my next suggestion that is:

Introduce more social elements. Have some kind of in-game chat. While in-game text chat )with a mute button) would be nice, I would settle for pre-written messages akin to Hearthstone. Also allow players to offer each other rematches and send each other friend requests through Steam.
Fix a hand scrolling on mac trackpad. It is impossible to play.
Edit: you can scroll by scrolling up and down, not right and left. Hope that will help somebody. BTW: I actually like this game :)
Great game.  Lots of outplay potential and a deep game in comparison to the competition in the market.  Sad that reddit shills tore this game apart, but you will not be disappointed.   Aside from the nerfs to hero cards that hampered the market, the update was great for the game.
Game is deeply technical with a lot of build variety included in the base set. I have read a few complaints about monitization and for the most part the comparisons are apple to oranges. You would hae to compare to a physical card game (Protecting your cardboard, storage) or other TCG's that allow trading (Hex, MTGO). As a dedicated TCG/CCG player since '94 This game packs ;) the value.
To start off this review there needs to be some disclaimers.
 Only one set of cards is out so there is a very well outlined meta and there are some cards that might be "broken". 
 There is an in game system to purchase packs and then individual cards via the marketplace.
 If you're looking for the perfect CCG I don't think Artifact is it, but it is without a doubt the most innovative CCG I have played in a very long time.

Pros:
 The overall design and interface is awesome and simple to use.
 The design of the actual cards is awesome with voiced characters and some "lore".
 The game animations give the CCG genre some serious life.
 There is a way to earn packs and tickets through a drafting system for achieving at least 3 to 5 wins with only losing 1 game.   (3 wins 1 ticket, 4 wins 1 ticket 1 pack, 5 wins 1 ticket, 2 packs)
 The design of the rounds, turns and, phases is unique and creative.
 The management of three lanes is the right amount of strategy, difficulty, and excitiment at the same time. 
 The ability to blend and have success with any color combination in draft.
 The network has been immaculate not a single hiccup or disconnect. 
 
Cons:
 There is a difficulty curve and skill gap that can be quite large.
   ( I spent about 13 hours playing before I actually played using tickets.)
 Constructed is not remotely as accesible as draft. 
 To be competitive at all in constructed you need to follow the "meta".
 To be competitive at all in constructed you will need to spend around $20ish
 
Final Thoughts:
 Artifact is awesome. If you enjoy CCGs you should definitely get this one maybe you don't need to buy in right away, at least follow it and watch how the development process unfolds. Wishlist it if you're hesitant maybe it'll go on sale. ;) I'm glad to get in on the opening set and can't wait to see what comes next. I have about 19.5 hours logged as of writing this maybe I'll come update it after another 20 hours. Until next time I'll be stealing your creeps and frustrating you endlessly. :) 

While at first there were some concerns about the economy seeming too greedy. Right now, with the change of offering a free Phantom Draft, you have the possibility of playing with all of the cards for the initial $20. You won't own them, but you will be able to play with them.

So to go in a bit more detail about it, but you need to take into consideration that I'm playing in 18th of November (2018) beta. So this might change in the future.

First of all and most importantly, there is no in-game currency, you won't get cards for free. It is not that big of a problem, since as I mentioned there are some modes that let you play with unowned cards.

And there are a few ways of obtaining cards:

- The simplest is buying a booster:

For 2$ (localized, so if you are from EU it will cost 1.75$ because of the currency exchange rates)
You get 12 cards: 2 items, 1 hero and 9 other regular cards. The drop rates are usually at least 1 rare, 3 uncommon, and all the other - commons, but sometimes you can get more than 1 rare and more than 3 uncommon.

- Winning on the "Expert" gauntlets.

There is an Expert gauntlet were you can pay a Ticket, to play, if you win more than 3 games, before you lose 2, you will get your ticket back and an additional booster to get more cards. Tickets are sold in packs of 5 for 5$.

- Playing "Expert" Keeper Draft.

Same as buying boosters, but you go through the process of drafting the cards and after the games you can keep them. It requires 2 tickets and 5 boosters, so it's pretty expensive (About $12) good thing about this, is that the rewards are better on this mode for winning, and also you can pick from every booster pack 2 cards, so if you search for a specific card from a booster this might have better chances of getting it.

- Steam market.

As at the time of writing, it is still not available. But, the tabs are made. This will allow you to buy, and sell cards on the Steam market place, which is useful, if you want a specific card, you don't have to gamble, or if you wanna sell your cards to recover some Steam $ and buy other cards, or another game if you are bored of Artifact. Pretty handy, only problem is that Valve hasn't made a statement as for now is the % fee it takes. It usually is 15% for a transaction, but it is still not known if it going to happen in Artifact.

So this is the really important things, if you wanna get into Artifact are that it might not be a game for everyone, but even if you only pay the initial $20 you get a really good deal. Also, the $20 entrance is not only for playing the game, but they give you 2 newbie decks (they are garbage...), 10 boosters and 5 tickets to play Expert Draft. So it is not like you get nothing. Also duplicates if you don't wanna sell it on the market place you can "break"/dust to get tickets, which sets a minimum price on cards.

------

Now let's talk about gameplay.

Oh boy this game is cool. It's complex, and hard, you might need to go through the tutorial, and there always new stuff you can learn. In that regard is similar to dota. BUT, there is RNG, there is some RNG on stuff, you can almost get always an answer to it, or plan ahead, but damn in 4 hours I got fucked a few times by RNG. I still think it is fun and worth to play. 

For the other stuff, like music, lore of dota, and more the game is 10/10 if you are into that stuff. It just plays well.

I might update this if things change, but for now, it looks really good, and as I’ve been telling you with free draft it means you can play all the cards at the base price of the game, so this instantly beats almost all the other card games in the market. Also some features are planned that are still not implemented.

Hope the long read helped on your decision. And if you are still unsure, just wait and see how things turn. But I'm expecting is going to be good, after the quick response and change to the economy made in less than 24 hours after the NDA lift.
Best damn card game I have played so far. I will be playing this for many years I expect. 

Free draft. Constructed prices are high at the moment but I expect them to go down over time as the game gives packs as prizes. No f2p but I see that as a boon after games like hearthstone and their endless grinding
Really fun, but with how young the game is a lot of the really good cards are a bit expensive. For $20 you can do infinite free draft and the preconstructed events. If you're looking for a card game you can grind out, this isn't it. This game is more about having fun instead of mindless grinding. Free yourself from the mobile gaming aspect of most card games.
While not without its problems, my enjoyment of Artifact ranks up there with the likes of Magic the Gathering and Android: Netrunner. It's as deep as it is unique. Valve have done a wonderful job transferring the varied characters of Dota to a card game format, with each hero representing their skillset in fun ways. Mechanically, it's brilliant. 

However, Valve has attempted to create a user-run economy with Artifact cards. You can buy/sell any single you wish on the Steam Marketplace. While this improves access to "key" cards, it means you may have to keep spending past the initial investment. It also means you could sell all of your cards for Steam wallet funds and stick to free-play. This has had a carry-on effect whereby Valve have been hesitant to reward players with booster packs (as doing so would drive down card prices as supply would exceed demand). Only recently have they reapproached their philosophy on player progression, which is why I'm writing this positive review. Valve have indicated that they are listening to feedback and making improvements. While we are still waiting for proper skill-ratings and better matchmaking, the base game is complete and shows a lot of promise. 

Regardless, while the price may be a sore-point for some, Artifact includes unlimited access to phantom draft and use of "free" decks. I particularly enjoy this, as I'm not required to "grind out" packs or digital currency. In short, Artifact is a digital TCG without the tedium of a F2P model. 

You may not enjoy Artifact if you ou love the thrill of opening boosters for rare cards and ranking up on leaderboards. But you will enjoy it if you have an interest in mechanically rich card games (especially if you love draft, like me!).
A fun new twist on CCG. 3 lanes instead of just 1 is a positive iteration. I wish the RNG was less impactful, but some of it is already being toned down, which is great. Valve is showing just a month after release that they're willing to listen to their players, so I'm giving this the thumbs up.
Pros and cons of Artifact:
+ Exposes poor people
+ Exposes Blizzdrones and Hearthcucks
+ Exposes people that unironically hyped HL3 despite never playing HL or HL2
+ Fun card game
+ No bots flooding every mode
- ???
True TCG at its core. People raging about monetization does not even try to understand this cheaper model than other most f2p CCGs that don't have an ability to sell all your cards if you want to quit the game. Plus grinding takes lots of time if you want to go competitive, furthermore i don't know any PRO player in most popular CCG that didn't sank thousands of dollars into cards. All raging people won't even go competitive, therefore they can play free casual drafts, casual matchmaking, rotating events that have preconstructed decks for free, YOU DO NOT NEED TO COLLECT CARDS TO PLAY FULL GAME.

Still this game is in early stages, many things can and will change. Overall very good game that has wider scope and way more depth than most other card games. Learning curve is pretty steep though.
I truly love the gameplay, and with yesterday's big patch it looks like they already fixed the two biggest problems! Now there's a progression system that gives you something to do other than grinding queues, plus they re-balanced several of the best and worst cards.
Wonderful game!

Great graphics, beautiful music and interesting mechanics. It's really unique in comparison with the other card games around. My favorite part that is also something that DotA 2 has, there are character interactions which give the player a better insight about the game's lore, really cool!

Even though there aren't many ways to get card packs by playing, there are still several modes that you can play for free without the need of cards or money. Also, I find it more efficient time and money wise that you can simply buy any card you need from the Steam marketplace instead of grinding for hundreds of hours or investing a lot of money and not even knowing if you'll get the card you want.

I'm really satisfied with the game and I recommend you all to try it out!
Harder and a lot less casual than most card games, but still very fun and has great gameplay. I wouldn't knock too much on the economic strategy game of this game, it's supposed to be a lot more like traditional TCGs where you can trade all the cards. It could be better, but it's not bad imo.
Brilliant card game which has interesting features. I was hyped to buy this game. But I didn't buy it when it first released because everyone said it requires your wallet to win games. So I decided to wait until I am convinced for the game that is not pay to win. So here is the basics about the game that you are wondering about:

First of all, I want you to think Elder Scrolls Legends and Magic the Gathering(MTG) had a baby and named it Artifact. 3 lane system with 4 different colors but the colors are simply like MTG colors w/out white cards. Instead you have some other kind of cards called items. 

There are 2 different game types called Draft and Constructed. And 4 Play modes called Solo, Social, Casual and Expert.

[b] Draft Mode [/b]
There are 12 cards in a pack. In the draft mode you open 5 packs which makes 60 cards and build your own deck from those 60 cards. You need 5 Heroes, 40 playing cards and 9 item cards. But you can increase the number of playing card and item cards in your deck. So like you have to have 5 heroes but you can have 50 playing cards and 10 item cards. Becase even if you don't choose any heroes game gives you 3 same heroes from each color. And you can play gauntlet which is basically 5 wins and 2 loses allowed game mode. 

[b] Constructed [/b]
Constructed game mode is the mode that you play with your own deck and you need to have all the cards (no sh*t Sherlock) to play with your deck. So to answer some questions [b] YES [/b] there are some decks cost you 25 bucks which is so expensive. But you dont need those. Because there are some budget decks cost you only 1 or 2 bucks but can help you to win 5 games in a gauntlet. So You don't need a blue-black control deck for the start (The most expensive decks) but still can win a ton of games. Just don't forget every deck has a counter. And also you can save a deck that you dont own its cards to see in your collection to finish it later.

[b] Play Modes [/b]
Solo: 
In the solo mode you can play a game or a gauntlet against the bots. Which is great because hard bots are not that dumb. But the best thing to play against bots is you can give the bots a deck that you dont own its all cards to see if that deck is good or not. So you may not to buy it after your games.

Social:
In the Social mode you can construct some tournaments or you can play with your friends.

Casual:
Ok in the casual mode you can play constructed or draft. You dont have to give anything to play. If you have a deck play constructed if not play draft. My suggestion is to play draft and get better and better till you can enter the expert draft gauntlets to earn packs to finish your collection. 

Expert:
Expert mode is the ranked mode for the casual. In the expert mode you have to give a ticket to play. If you can win 3 games in a gauntlet you get your ticket back. If you win 4 you get a pack in addition and if you win 5 you get 1 ticket and 2 packs. Which is ok. Its not that much of a problem to win 3 games in a gauntlet so just try some casual drafts and begin playing the expert mode. Yes its not that fair to give something to the game after you bought the game but, you don't have to. You can always play casual to get better. There is no rank system so you only get packs which you dont have to get for the first round. But there is another game mode called KEEPER DRAFT. 
KEEPER DRAFT:
In this mode you give 2 tickets and 5 packs to play. Do you remember what i said about draft mode? You open 5 packs and create a deck with them. In this mode you keep the cards that you draft. So you dont lose any cards. But If you win 3 games in this mode you get 2 tickets and 1 pack. If you win 4 you get 2 tickets and 2 packs and yet if you win 5 you get 2 tickets and 3 packs. So after you get better in the game Do a phantom draft which is a 1 ticket exchange draft mode and earn some packs then use the packs in this mode. 

To conclude I must add that you start with 5 tickets and 10 packs. So I dont recommend you to open those packs. You can save them for Keeper Draft. But I highly recommend the game. Search the internet for decks and copy their decks codes then paste with ctrl-v in the game's build section. See the prices, see the cards and dont buy them. Untill you opened some packs and earned some money from the game. Because remember if you buy the cards, you can sell them too. So you may not lose any money if you open every single pack and sell the extra cards. In my first deck I opened Axe which is 10 dollars. And I not even using it because I like to play full black aggro decks cost me only 2 dollars. And I can always sell them to 2 dollars if I get bored...

Thank you for reading. Hope to see you in the game.
I like it, i played Magic from the Age of 10-20 and after that Heartstone, Heartstone kinda gets boring and i wanted some fresh wind for my Brain to strategize about, Bosters cost 1.75€/12Cards wich is quite cheap compared to others, i would call it fair pricing for what you get, you also can sell and buy cards individually wich is way more acceptable than lets say Heartstone where people are forced to get their cards by farming/buying rediciulous amounts of packs... 

All in all youll get 10 Bosters for the pay of 17.50 wich is a 1 to 1 ratio so you dont kinda invest into nothing.

Yes Enemies are unbalanced players, many down here in the comments say its pay to win, but what do they think how cardgames work where the goul is making good strategies and "gonna catch em all" its what it is and nothing else, its fair, its fresh, its what people who play these type of games want and get, try it out ... i mean its just 17.50, you can come back on later editions and look into it again like i do in heartstone where i dont play every season since some are complete trash if it comes to combos etc :P
Love the game, alot of people forget this game is only 3 months old. There is huge potential and im sure it will get better and better. I do admit that constracted is a bit limited. so i mainly play draft and i love it. you could probably buy all cards for £100 which is alot cheaper than HS. I hope valve dont give up and its only a matter of time till it picks up...
Artifact has the most unique and engaging gameplay of any card game i've played and i've played many of them for years. There's finally a card game that lets you draft for free, forever. Every game feels incredibly close and I always see something I could have done better or a decision I should have/shouldnt have made. The polish on display here is incredible as well. Every hero has voice acted lore and interactions with other specific cards in the game. The imps fly around the board taunting you and carrying your deck from board to board with style. With this update (12/20/2018) Valve has responded to basically every complaint the community has had (besides 1v1 draft with friends). You can now earn packs and tickets through playing the game and they've fixed cards deemed unfun by the community (cheating death). There's a ranking system across game modes and challenges that require you to do certain things in a match to earn extra XP. There are automated open tournaments you can join with interesting formats (currently pauper constructed). If you love deep strategic card games, but the business model had you on the fence, now's the time to jump in and climb the ladders.
Highly fun and deeply strategic game.  After every match, it seems like there are always one or two key decision points that massively impacted who won or lost. While it's not for everybody, the game offers deep, competitive gameplay for those looking for the challenge.
The game is really fun, but not without its flaws. It's insanely deep and VERY addicting, and most games would leave you on the edge of the seat - that's how intense can it be. Also, soundtrack. And besides, you can play the draft, constructed events or other non-expert modes without any additional payments. I do hope Valve expands with some social stuff in future, as right now even the chat is not in the game yet. Quite excited to see the game evolve, it's pretty damn solid and fun!
If you like (esp if you prefer) limited game modes $20 is totally worth in my opinion. Unlimted phantom drafting with no rewards. I really don't think i'd have gotten the game if this wasn't included.

People really just dont seem to like thre being a price tag on everything to gain more cards...even tho most of those price tags are literally pennies.

Get decent enough at the game it looks like you'll just be able to get more cards that way. 3 wins in expert phantom draft breaks even (4 = 1 pack 5 = 2 packs).  You can convert 20 cards into a ticket for entry as well. I can definitely envision it being fairly inexpensive to maintain being able to participate.

I would have obviously preferred the game being free (duh) but the 20 dollars is kinda just a mandatory starter bundle.
This game is fantastic. 

Only complaint is Town Portal is too OP in draft format.


Richard Garfield has outdone himself

Might want to wait for a few patches. I believe they are adding a progression system next week.
Great Game for anyone enjoying challenging Card Games. I have played Hearthstone for some years and Gwent/Magic after that. Artifact brings a highly polished Product, with tons of features other Card Games had been lacking for Years.

Just to name a few:

- integrated user tournaments, highly customizable
- full steam integration, which brings friendslist, groups, steamchat, market and in house streaming - you can even play it on tablet and mobile
- best deckbuilder in the industry, easy to use and the ability to share decklists via 'copy n paste'
- build in decktracker, the ability to sort your cards, clear but in depth UI
- fully voiced lore for every card

The monetization has been critizised a lot, even though it is one of the best you can get. Buying your cards on the market is really affordable, a complete collection goes below 200€ and a complete common/uncommon with some additional rares below 100€. For Draft, which is supposed to be the primary mode in artifact, you dont need any cards at all.
All Gamemodes can be played for free! Only if you want to play for rewards you will have to get a ticket, which is 90ct and gives at least 1hr of playtime.

Overall this is a masterpiece which avoids to be a f2p grind mill. Cudos to valve for this great decision!
The hate on Artifact is absurd.

Of course, the game is "pay to win." It is a digital trading card game. You construct a deck through buying booster packs or purchasing individual cards. It is not hard to understand.

My only gripe is the lack of daily or weekly events. This would enable players a limited way to earn cards without actually paying for them. There are free modes that do not require you to purchase cards though.

If you have the money to spend, I would grab it. It's a fun TCG.
I love the presentation, I love the gameplay, and I don't like the monetization. I think like a lot of Valve stuff in the past, Artifact's monetization is a test. In theory if you are good enough you can continually win packs and event tickets through Gauntlet (their main competitive mode) But Gauntlet costs event tickets at $1 per ticket; you are given 5 free event tickets in the beginning. I am someone who wants to work up to Gauntlet, and there are others who can already play guantlet indefintely bc they constitenly win enough to receive tickets. This is where I don't think its fair to others who don't want to be as competitive, and instead want to play more casual modes. For these people there is no way to earn cards except through the $1.99 packs. So if you are thinking about getting this game, really ask yourself how much you want to try at it. Like Dota 2, Artifact is not for the faint of heart and can take a lot of work but it has ways of rewarding that work.
LOVE THIS GAME. I wouldnt say its pay to win but i would say pay to play. The reason i say it isnt pay to win is because you CAN beat kids that steal their moms credit card and buy all the op cards. You just have to use your brain.
After the recent update, almost all complaints from the community have been addressed. The core gameplay of Artifact is incredible, and is one of the only card game experiences I have ever had where I honestly feel like I had a chance to win every game I lost.
Don’t listen to the haters on this game.  Sure it’s not free but even $40 bucks is enough to build some viable decks and have fun.  It takes about 25 hours to really learn most of the mechanics and I must say this game is deep and a true extension of Dota, and I love Dota.

This game is also cheaper that Hearthstone and much more complex.  

The soft and weak will complain about spending money but guess what, I’m sucked in and will see hundreds of hours of entertainment playing this.  Eat my ass broke plebs and get a job.
This game is by far the best TCG iv'e played. It's Unique with a very infinate skill ceiling. It plays out like a moba style card game with lanes/creeps/towers/items and heros. 

Unfortunatly it is true; you need to dish out cash for cards and are looking to honestly pay $20-70 for a strong competetive deck. You can buy singles rather then packs to ensure you know how much it will take to create the deck you're building. You can win packs and tickets from draft once the game is purchased but will need to buy singles/packs to play constructed once you've built a full deck.

Overall i think this game is well worth it if you're aware what you'll need to dish out to get started. It's a shame a lot of people wont experience this game because of the monetization.
I waited ages for this game, and can happily admit it was worth the wait. I was hesitant about the model of the game, but after having some time with it, I greatly enjoy it. I will admit that the lack of rewards in terms of daily quests and such is somewhat annoying, but at worst that's what it is. Just annoying. 

As someone who prefers limited formats (Draft, sealed, etc), being able to draft to my hearts content makes this game worth every penny spent on it.
Artifact (2018) online - 2300 
Age of Empires 3 (2005) online - 2200
That's all you need to know.

UPD

Artifact (2018) online - 500
Age of Empires 3 (2005) online - 2200
I've spend the past 4 days refining a deck, and it's starting to show some real promise. I'm spending hours playing casual just to find out which single card should be swapped out. I imagine I'll continue to do this until it crushes, which it's starting to do. I got a turn 3 win with it today, and it feels really good. The best part is that I'm not following some meta, or buying expensive cards. I just found some synergies that no one was using, and built upon it with more synergies.

I especially like the fact that I don't have to grind for cards (though grinding is an option). I have an idea of what I want to do, and I buy the cards I want to achieve that goal. Currently  (Dec 22, 2018) 252 of the current 310 cards are under 10 cents. Only 9 of the cards are over $2, the the most expensive being Axe at $10.00 (at the time of this writing) So yeah I built a super cheap deck and it's the most fun I've had playing wizard poker since MTG.
I'm ultimately happy playing this game. Even losing dont bring me down the same way Dota2 does, coz here i have no one to blame but myself (and RNG), and if i dont learn from my past mistakes -- its on me.
Game is fantastic quality, for 20$ you can play all 300+ cards in different modes, no need to buy anything extra. Unless you go competitive.
The only downside is it takes 15~25 minutes pet match, and there is usually only 4 hours of free time in the day, limiting how much i physically able play.
Its easily the most complex and deep card game on the market. Ive played magic for a lot of years and play solely Vintage and Legacy in that game due to their complex nature. Im happy to say this game lives up to those standards in my opinion. Most certainly my new favorite game.
Very well designed digital CCG introducing several unique mechanics which add additional layers of strategic depth well beyond existing games in the genre. Matches are a lot of fun and highly tense. The overall experience is superbly polished with graphics, music, and voice acting that one might expect from a Valve title.

Most negative reviews simply come from a huge misunderstanding of how the card market for this game works. Yes to construct custom decks and compete for prizes at the highest levels, additional investment beyond the base purchase is required. You may also continuously play Phantom Draft (IMO the most fun mode) for no additional money and with full access to the complete card set. If you do wish to build specific decks, obtaining cards from the market is much more reasonable than in similar games.

In launch state the biggest issues with the game are the inability to play a Phantom Draft format selectively with friends (or allow 2-player "Tournaments"), and lack of social/comms features - there is currently no way to express your "GG" after a hard-fought battle which leaves the experience feeling rather solitary.
I dont like the monetization aspect of the game. I really tried to like it and i can afford pay to play but it just feels really bad and i dont want to play a game that makes me feel bad.

Edit: After two patches i really like the deriction this game is heading. Would buy again.
Artifact is a good game with some incredibly annoying issues. If the game was just Constructed Format for those new to card games this means you go in with a pre-constructed deck) I'd be inclined to say it's not worth it. So I'm going to seperate this review into three sections: the really good, the really bad, and the eh.

Really good:
As someone who's played card games for most of their life, topping tornaments in various games, most notably Yugioh in 2014, this game is good. The game design is deep and mulitfacited, there's a level of simplicity to the general mechanics and interactions, and valve have done a good job explaining their jargon/lingo. You can watch a game on youtube and generally know how to play it just after, that for a card game is amazing and should be a reason for people to play it. On top of this though, is the depth. There is a good amount of complexity in the game due to inititative mechanics, some RNG mechanics, and Hero Selection (I don't think Hero Selections work as well as something like Archetype mechanics in other games but it's still good). The depth is there, there's definately a skill curve that makes the game fun to play around with.

Visually this game is gorgeous, I'd say it's prettier than Heartstone but that's subjective. What's objective is that the game runs well and has had a lot of money pumped into it to make it look pretty. I don't play Dota 2, but the card art, world, and comic has made me want to get into it, so that's a plus. 

Tournaments are fun, this game is good for those who play TCGs, it takes elements such as local tournaments and different formats (such as draft) that make it work. The game is very obviously adapting itself from a TCG model instead of the online model, which I love. The issue I've had with Heartstone is that it costs so much to get upto date with it, having a direct market so you can just buy the cards makes things a lot easier and makes remaining competative fun. Where this becomes an issue is the price of the game. It's £15. I had this game bought for me, I wouldn't drop £15 on a card game because I'm cheep and have, literally since I started in 2002, never played a deck worth more than £30. So this is where I'm going to talk about the really bad.

The really bad: 
Having a community run Market place is all good and well until cards are broken. Now, as said before, I've played TCG competetively, I know when cards are broken, I know how meta works, and I know how TCG companies can gain from it. Cards such as Drow Ranger and more so, Axe, are just incredibly broken, they have better stats, effects, and give the opponent distinct advantages. To me, this issue isn't due to the card itself being broken, it's to do with the game itself being broken fundementally. 

I'm going to just quickly tangent but I have a point for it. In games such as Yugioh, you have something called Staple cards. Staple cards are cards that fundementally are very good, they're all round good cards that can be put into many decks, usually it's to make the deck more efficient, such a draw cards. These cards are ALWAYS expensive, always. Some players justify this because they're unneccessary and can be worked around. A good example is Pot of Greed, yes a banned card, but if this card came to Yugioh's TCG format today and was a rare, it would be priced rediculously. I would be fine with staple cards in this game being pricey, that's normal. However, HERO cards are fundemental cards that make up the playstyle, theme, and feeling of a deck. They control the balance, and Valve have allowed these cards, which fundementally should be for everyone, to reach such a high price point. Yes, this price has gone down, but it's still not good game design. These Hero cards should either be free, or all commons, as so many decks need them to be competetive. You cannot play Constructed without cards such as Axe, DR, Sniper, Kanna, they are just the best cards within their colours, they control the form of style you can play. Playing swarm without Kanna is just harder, and you're at a distinct disadvantage. As a budget player I feel this, there's no real work around. I've played budget my entire life and have beaten tournaments with cheep ass decks, and yet in this game it's nearly impossible to play Constructed without it. I will win 3, lose 2, and repeat. Meta always wins. This sounds like me ranting that I dont have enough money to play the game, and sure, I probably dont. But this game is marketed as a competetive game. Valve, you can't have a competetive game whilst putting all players at a distinct disadvantage if they don't spend £15 on Axe to play your damn red deck. It's dumb. I'm glad the prices are going down, but it's still dumb and we're going to keep having this issue every set if you don't fix your damn game.

The Eh:
There's a good amount of playstyles that are viable, but none are really strictly enourmously engaging, this is in the Eh section because in card games this isn't new. 
Every game is different, I love that but I dont think it belonged in the Great section. This is mainly due to the varying quality of games, you either stomp, top-deck, or get stomped. You can usually tell from about turn 3 who's gonna win. In casuals it's usually just "I have a disadvantage, surrender", which sucks, but makes sense as the mental energy you have to spend to turn a game is sometimes just not even worth it.
The amount of cards in the game is a bit low. I know Valve are going to release more, but it feels a bit weird to release a game with this little content, it's not entirely negative or postitive as Valve had done a good job with what they released. It's mostly good content taken down by some bad monotization and gameplay features.

Overall, I've had an amazing time playing the game and watching it. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys TCG's, but get it when it's on sale, if it ever is. 

No one is really playing the constructed deck option so i'm just selling all the cards that i win in the tournaments (got like 20 tickets now)

Gameplay is solid and, if you want, gathering all the cards from the set is cheaper than in the titles like hearthstone or magic the gathering online.

Buy only if you want to play really cool card game :)
Best card game I've ever played. Not a f2p scam like other games, enjoyable, deep, easy to learn and hard to master. And for sure, a great lore for us Dota 2 fans.
So far i'm enjoying the game, even doh there are flaws and what not. There plently room for improvment to come. also i have no problem in paying for card or pack cause i'm use to buying single card for yugioh ect.
Just bought it at 2pm... played nonstop till 7pm lol.

Gonna have a quick dinner, then it's back to the board!

All I can say is I haven't bought a single card, and yet I'm having a lot of fun. Maybe it's because I was a MTG fan, so this game feels right at home. But this is a tad more complex compared to MTG, definitely more complex than HS.

If Valve continues to improve the progression, add expansions, and so on, this is gonna be one heck of a game for diehard and hardcore fans.

For the general gaming audience, I don't see it being extremely appealing mainly because it requires "too much" of thinking, reading, calculation, strategy... over mindless gung ho' running and gunning.

So I just don't see artifact becoming HUGE, and we shouldn't expect it to be so.

But who knows!

Anyway , it is what it is.

Not sure why people spend so much time complaining about the cash economy and all that when the free modes are already a ton of fun.

Good day!

P.S Adding controller support would be perfect.
The game itself is good, I love it personally. Definitely a weird monetization model for the current era, there's ways to f2p(kinda, post initial cost) but not to earn cards. You can do that or you can buy a collection that you're able to sell back for 85% of its value(in steam dollars). Its not crazy it is pay to play and to compete with a top tier deck is probably gonna cost you 50 bucks but you can always just play tournaments with custom rulesets which ban the most expensive cards, or draft which is free. The game functionally is 10,000 times better running and smoother than hearthstone, with better voicework(in my opinion) and better animations which are not re-used over and over again. Plus there is already built in tournament support.
Well, I feel compelled to fight people who give this game tumbs down just because it is not "free to play". First of all, those "free to play" card games are anithing but, if you're not paying straight up from your wallet you're paying with your time. And thats ALOT of time. And time is money, yes. Saw that mono green deck is very good, looked on market how much would it cost to buy whole deck, and guess what, to bay every green card to max number you can take to constructed costs 50 euros. That's peanuts considering other tcg. So, on average, to buy WHOLE collection of cards you'll need something about $350, which isnt at all that bad. Beside this, game is very good, nice graphic, everything runs fine, and games are very different one from another. All in all, good job valve
For 20$ you can play infinite hours in Casual Phantom Draft.

This is easily the best way to play if you're not looking to spend money on decks. Even deck i sold a rare acquired in my starting deck for $2 and was able to buy cards missing for a deck i created w/ that. 


Best card game I have ever played so far. 

I really really enjoy drafting in the game and I recommend it to everyone who love playing card games. pretty much the most unique card game right now.
I just made 2 custom decks without any prior knowledge of deck building or the game itself but I am winning a lot of matches. The game is very refreshing for new players. I started playing two other card games the H one and the S one ;) but I always got matched up against stupidly crazy card holder players with no scope for me to win whatsoever. This game seems to have much better balanced matches. If you can spend a few bucks, this game is definitely going to be a great time pass for you. And if you like building complicated strategies of course.
wouldnt it be funny if fucking stupid pieces of shit on this forum came in, bought the game and seriously discussed the gameplay mechanics of this soulless piece of shit aaa pile riding on the coattails of investor trends rofl. like wouldn't it be hilarious if this happened every single time a horrid pile came out and a million little bape onions crawled out of a festering aaa corpse like a john carpenter movie hahahahaha. looking forward to seeing this happen again and again until i finally pull the trigger and kill ymself
easily best card game to play on PC. Drafting is completely free, so that's how I usually choose to play.

But if you want to buy the cards, you can make a fairly competitive deck quite cheap since you can buy individual cards that you need for a couple cents. There's only a handful of cards that are worth more than two dollars at the moment.
It's too early to say if Artifact is the new best digital TCG, however, I absolutely love it. The game is beautiful, polished, and fun. 

Here are my thoughts from playing it so far:

Pros:

- Incredibly polished game. The animations are great, the art is fantastic, the sound effects and voicelines are excellent.
- Very fun gameplay. ...not much to say here. I played a lot of Hearthstone and it was a different kind of fun to Artifact, but Artifact is still fun - but more in a competitive way. It's fun to make good plays and win, specifically. The cards aren't quite as fun to play individually, on average.
- Multiple gamemodes. Draft and constructed, specifically. Draft is very fun, extremely high skill cap. Can play all game modes for free casually & with friends, can create tournaments in-game.

Cons:

- Could be cheaper. There are only 4 colours, and due to the way the game works, each colour has one-three 'really good' heroes. So if you want to play a (constructed) deck with that colour, you won't really be competitive without having that 'really good' hero. (i.e. Drow Ranger, Axe, maybe Kanna) Note: This should change as time goes on and people discover better deck archetypes than "let's put the strongest hero in the game into our deck", also as more cards are released.
- Game isn't 'always' fun. It's fun to win, it's fun to make good plays. But I'd sooner call this game 'satisfying' than 'fun'. Maybe not a con, but for some people it might be.
Great game overall.  Visually the most beautiful digital card game to date.  Easy to learn with a ton of depth and complexity to your decisions.  I dropped 50 bucks on cards in addition to the 20 at launch, and am nearing a full collection just playing a ton of expert phantom draft.  I am experienced with many card games, but so far I'm breaking about even on the event tickets just from winning the ticket back with a 3+ win, and earning extra tickets from card recycles on the packs I win to offset the losses if I get a particularly poor draft.

I feel like there is a ton of value here for the 20 dollar entry just in the free private tournaments if you have any friends who also buy in.  Overall I'd recommend if you enjoy card games.  If you have tried and didn't enjoy several other card games, I doubt this would change your mind on the genre.
It's really good, Valve is obviously in it for the long haul. The last update really fixed almost everything. I'm surprised people have so little faith in Valve.
Honestly some of the most fun I've had in a card game just creating decks and trialling them out against friends. In other games like Hearthstone, I feel compelled to use netdecks otherwise what comes out of my brainhole feels like an absolute monstrosity. Here, every composition feels viable and competitive along with being extremely fun to experiment with.

Kids complaining about the monetization model don't understand how great it is to be able to pick up cards for a few cents instead of grinding them out over hours and hours of gameplay to possibly never get what you're looking for. And that's just for the "Expert" mode, you can use all of the cards in casual mode and it's an absolute blast.
Don't understand  the hate for this game. You can play every card in the game through the free phantom draft. You don't get this in other card games. You don't ever need to touch the "competetive" part of the game if you don't feel like it. I've played hearthstone and MTG - Arena, and while this payment model is different, I don't find it predatory. I would argue it's the opposite, since you can access the entire card pool for the initial purchase. The pricing for cardpacks also seem better than MTG - arena, since you get more cards in a pack, for a lower cost, with less card being locked behind different rarities.

EDIT: I've now played the game four about ~40 hours. Funny thing is, I can actually sell the cards I've earned and get back all of the 17 or so dollars I spent buying the game. If the market for rare cards stays alive I can def see draft players going infinte if they keep selling the rare cards they get on the market. I can even imagine good draft players "earning" a couple of bucks if they can keep a high win ratio. Obviously this only applies for players who care more about drafting then getting a "complete" card collection for construced play.

Edit2: Sold back some of the more expensive cards I got in packs. I earned around 24 euro in total. I spent around 24 euro on the game in total. I've played around 85~ hours. Never touched constructed. 

Only part of this game that could EVER be considered "pay 2 win" would be the constructed part. There's really little incentive to ever touch that, unless you really enjoy that aspect of the game, and even then, the money you have to shell out to get a competetive deck pales in comparison to games like heartstone and mtg arena.
Pros:
Incredibly polished game engine
Beautiful aethetics & animations
High skill ceiling with a low skill curve for learning
Free to play drafts 
incredibly well designed cards and balanced as a whole

Cons:
Lazy RNG designed cards - Cheating Death and Bounty Hunter's passive as examples
Opening packs of cards and getting cards from the starter decks
Some heroes feel unplayable compared to their more powerful alternatives.
No features to interact with the other player yet. Ie chat/emotes ect.

Overall:
It's not going to be a game for everyone, but if you enjoy high ceiling strategy games and trading card game mechanics such as drafting and deckbuilding this is undoubtedly the BEST digital TCG.

Tl;dr This is the best designed card game to come out in a very long time and all of the complaints are unfounded. 

Please PLEASE do not listen to all the negativity here. Most of the negative reviews I’ve seen are people not really knowing what they’re talking about. Such as:

1) The game is NOT pay to win. Pay to win means the person who has spent the most money will always beat someone who has spent less. This is simply not true. There are parts of the game that have an entry fee, but these modes offer prizes for doing well so there must be a risk/reward for that to make sense. There are plenty of ways to fully enjoy the game, even take it seriously on a professional level FOR FREE once you buy the game. (Also just on that note, for your $20 you’re getting $25 worth of in game stuff) 

For example, casual phantom drafts. Completely free, forever. You can draft online competitively and with your friends in private games for free. No other game offers this. And draft in this game is much more of a serious format than Hearthstone’s Arena. There will be entire groups of pro players that only care about draft, much like there are in magic. 

2) That leaves constructed. I’m upset at how little thought has gone into most of these reviews because they don’t understand how this would actually work but not allowing packs or cards to be grindable actually MAKES THE GAME CHEAPER. Quick example is again Hearthstone, because of how much free to play stuff there is in the game if you want to just buy a pack it’s $2 and that’s 5 cards with only a guaranteed 3rd tier rarity in it. Two whole rarity tiers above what you’re guaranteed are possible but very rare. Packs in Artifact are also $2, but you get 12 cards and a guaranteed highest rarity in every pack! PLUS, you don’t just have to buy packs and hope you get what you want like in hearthstone. You want a certain card?! Just go buy it on the marketplace! I bet it’s like $0.14 anyways! There are very few cards that cost anything significant and they’re still dropping. 

When cards are earnable, they naturally will have to be much more expensive to sustain an income. Again see Hearthstone, you want a top tier deck immediately when you start playing? (You shouldn’t, but just for the sake of argument) You’re gonna have to buy a good $200 worth of packs in hopes of opening what you need, and if you don’t you’ll likely have to destroy most of your cards to get this one deck. You want a top top tier deck in Artifact? $45. And that’s one of the more expensive ones, blue/green combo. 

I’m upset at how few people stop to consider why a decision isn’t what they wanted, and instead jut jump straight to complaining. Game is freaking awesome. You should gather that by the fact that not one negative review actually talks about the game itself, only it’s economy. The negativity will slowly fade away and what will be left will be a passionate group of players in love with the best card game available today.

Artifact is a must buy for anyone that enjoys card games.
Simple the fact that you can play a mode called casual phantom draft where you have access to all the cards should provide you hours of gameplay.This is the practice mode where you can learn all the cards before actually owning them.

1 game easily lasts for 15 minutes minimum so when you pay a 1$ ticket for an expert phantom draft you know you will play anywhere from 2-6 games hence 30 minutes- 90 minutes playtime with the chance to win your ticket back if you do 3 wins or even get 2 packs if you manage 5 wins. It is worth it.

There are only 3 top rated decks at the moment with only few days into the game and just the basic set out BUT there currently is no ladder therefore noone plays constructed.People will grind constructed once valve adds a number to it which i am sure they will then as expansions cards hit the meta will get more complicated.

There is a mode called keeper draft where you pay the 1 ticket entrance plus the price of 2 packs but you get to keep the cards you draft.Now here's the catch.If you pick cards that are not in your collection chances are you will not have a strong deck so you will not make it to the prizes.So with the marketplace in place keeper draft is not really +expected value at the moment.I expect valve to up the prizes a bit maybe to getting your initial 2 packs back after the 5 wins.Also once you are close to having the full collection of cards there is no point in playing keeper's draft.This should change.

There are no foil cards/heroes at the moment.Valve should consider adding them.It would give a carrot to a stick for people to play the paying modes (phantom/keeper) draft in hopes of getting them and sell them to the markeplace.

Finally to all the people saying this game is pay to win.You can spend money to buy all the cards but that wont change your decision making that wont give you the time needed to grind to a top spot in the ladder that will not make you a pro.

If like me you only have couple of hours each day to grind the 1$ entrance to phantom draft doesnt sound so bad specially when you get the chance to win packs and build your collection.

Tldr : Graphics : 9/10
         Gameplay: 8/10
         Pay to win: 2/10

It's a great game that requires a ton of concentration and thinking. It's super fun if you ignore all the negative press and comments on it. It's still playable even if you don't want to spend money since draft is free and it's arugably the best mode anyways.
absolutely comical that people are saying its pay2win! 

its a TCG. just like IRL, you need to buy cards...to have cards...

and unlike hearthstone, you can actually trade cards, and redeem cards for value.


Honestly this is hands down one of the best TCGs i have ever played. People complaining want to play for free while reaping all the rewards. If you are a lover of drafting and TCGs in general this will not dissapoint. The haters just live in 3rd world countries. Get it.
IGNORE THOSE COMPLAINING ABOUT MONETIZATION!!

The game is great! been playing for a while in the free draft mode (yes you pay 20 bucks but dont need to pay more)

Unless you want to go for a collection you dont need to pay more... Plus if you want too most cards are a few cents on the community market.

HIGHLY RECCOMENDED
This was my first ever online card game, I like turn based games to i thought i'd give this a try, I had no idea how to play going in. My first impressions were good. It was difficult enough without being too easy (vs bots), the animations were nice and cleaving 3 creeps with Sven was rewarding.

I should've stuck to bot games. As soon as i joined a public match with my bog standard deck at level 1 i was up against a level  9, not knowing what this meant i continued. I was trampled. Not because of bad strategy, although it left something to be desired, my deck was just obliterated. 

The next game was just the same. I have played 24 hours of this, changing up my strategy, my deck etc. to no avail. I won some games but my win rate is pretty abysmal. I bought this after reading some new reviews and a game update about how you can earn cards rather than buy them and also how they balanced some other components. This is not the case. 

If you want to win, buy the cards. you will hardly win and will not gain enough XP without no-lifeing this game. Don't misunderstand me, if i wasn't this frustrated by constant ass rape i might buy a couple of new decks, but not anymore. IF you buy the cards buy them and you will trample people like me, also if you're a veteran card game extraordinaire, i would rather pay money to watch you beat these pay-to-win guys with a basic deck!
This game is AMAZING. Every match has me on the edge of my seat - the strategic gameplay is incredibly satisfying and deep.  Artifact produces some of the most amazing comeback moments I've ever seen in a competitive game. I've lost count of the number of times I've been able to swing a losing match for the win - even sometimes on the last turn.  Every game feels incredibly balanced and you never encounter a match that feel impossible because you have the wrong cards (unless you’re playing constructed without a meta deck, but that goes for any card game) The point is – in modes like draft, or pauper tournaments, or the event – your success or failure comes down to how well you play, not how lucky you are.  

The key to Artifact is thinking about why you lost - there is almost always a play you could have managed better - or a lane deployment that could have made the difference.  I'd recommend starting with bots until you get your head around the game - then move into the casual competitive modes.  Draft is the best place to start because you don't have to own all the best cards.  The event mode is great too since you're given a pre-constructed deck and get to face off with other pre-constructed decks.  It makes for a pretty level playing field that focuses on skill.  Learning how to deck build in draft is a fantastic way to move into constructed - but if you're like me, you'll probably fall in love with draft and move into expert mode.  having to use a ticket to play really turns the heat up and makes people play very competitively.  You get some great games out of the buy in and winning back your event ticket on turn three feels fantastic not to mention the free packs if you make it to round 4 and 5!

Beyond the gameplay itself, I've really enjoyed the lore and all the voice acted card text.  There's actually a narrative  - don't miss out on the comics! I've also really enjoyed selling my valuable cards on the market and using the money to buy and sell other cards for a profit.  The Steam marketplace app becomes a little card stock market in your pocket - spotting good deals and flipping cards for cash is a blast, and can help you fill out your collection or buy event tickets without spending anything more than the initial buy-in.  

In summary - this game is fun.  SERIOUSLY fun.  I doubt I'll be playing anything else for a very, very long time.  See you in game!
When it comes to card games, Artifact is a breath of fresh air. It is, in my opinion, one of the most complex and fun to play digital TCG.
Sure, there have been some hiccups with the launch and the game is not perfect but, with enough dedication from the development team, it will get there. 
The biggest selling point for me is the integrated tournament mode which is a blast to experience.
Everyone is hating on this game for the business model but the game is actually fantastic. I've always wanted to get into a card game but the sheer amount of cards in games like MTG was intimidating, especially considering the fact that everyone has been playing it forever and has incredible cards already. I felt like playing this would at least put me on the same knowledge base level with the other players. It turns out I love deckbuilding. I suck at it, but it is incredibly satisfying. Even if you never buy a card, the featured event Call to Arms gives players free decks to play with (against opponents that use the same precreated decks so it's fair). I will definitely be playing this game more.
Visual/Audio : 5/5 Best digital card game presentation
Gameplay : 4/5 The rules are simple, but you can come up with diverse strategies out of it. The downside is RNG.
Economy model : 4/5 The game itself costs 22500 won, cannot get card packs through grinding. However, can buy each card you want for about 2000 won at most. Also, draft mode(equivalent of Hearthstone arena) is free.
I was looking forward to this game and when it came out I looked for reviews. Everyone was raging about it being a cash grab and so on and it nearly made me not buy it. When I heard about endless free casual draft mode I just said "eh F it, I'll buy anyways". 

And oh boy that was the right decision. I am a long term MTG fan, I like deeper and more complex games and Artifact just tickles me at the right places. I'm having a blast playing this game. It has requires quite a bit of thinking and planning ahead and the mechanics are just really fun once you understand them.

For a Trading Card Game this is not a cashgrab imo. You can buy like 90% of the cards for REAL CHEAP directly through the steam community market. You can spent like 20€ and have 80-90% of the cards. Which is totally acceptable.
Very fun, and thoughtful game. Initially I was worried about how the game launched with no in-game communication, and no account progression... But Valve has made 2 updates since release, and has actually started working on these areas bigtime. This really sends good signals. Good guy Valve. I am hopeful that this very fun and strategic card game will have a bright future.
Perfect butt-clenching gameplay due to its sheer complexity and vast amount of interactions. Every game is different... like Dota but this time its a card game.

Great, deep card game with tons of stategy and variety. Has takes on elements from many card games that will feel familiar no matter what other card game you come from but will spin those elements to feel fresh and new. Yes you have to pay for packs and for event tickets but the cost vs. value is better than pretty much every card game (packs sitting around a similar, if not cheaper, price to other games but offering more cards with chances are multiple rares in them). Integrated market that can be used from inside the game client means that you can also buy specific cards without gambling on packs and you can sell whatever excess cards you have quickly and easily.
I'm not able to comprehend the negitivity in the reviews...

The game has one of the most enjoyable experiences in CCG gameplay.
Even when making a bad move that causes you to lose there is a moment of "Ah!~" that leaves you wanting to play again. 

I have thrown together a deck in phantom draft without any thought in the cards, (clicking at random). Won 4 Lost 2. 
Decks are only worth the effort you put into their use.  

Pros:
-Unique mechanics.
-Phantom Draft
-The rules of the game. 
-Turning points in the game always make you aware of mistakes you have made.
-Using the items you can purchase at the end of each turn to just teleport your heros back to well after baiting out your opponents cards then place them all on another lane in at the start of the next turn causing your opponent to have a bunch of cards stuck on one lane and you wipe out his guardian in 2 turns. :)


Cons: 
-Games can take a while 20-30+ depending on how the game is progressing.
-I cannot listen to an audiobook while playing if I want to win.
-"Good" decks dont make good players. 


The core gameplay is really good, I'm having a lot of fun with it. There are some things lacking like ranked matches, stats, chat (or even just emote), and draft games against friends, but I know they are working on most of it.
The main problem people have with the game is that it's not free, but the game is well worth the money in my oppinion. And although you can't refund it you can sell your cards and sometimes get even more than you paid for the game.
The game is dead, please try to recover the game instead of thinking how to earn more money from the ticket. The leveling system for me is a bit too much for Phantom draft. Win a few games then level up already and havent even get some perfect run thou. Havent even really earn some packs and it makes ppl harder to earn pack from phantom draft :). I would not say is a bad things but it makes ppl hard to earn packs and it may cause ppl to lost the fun of it. Whats the point? The game is dead anyways. 

Recommendation.
1. Organise more Artifact tournament from valve. Make it like The International and eventually attracted more people to play. Or else people play with no goals. If dota 2 is without The International, then i guess i wont be try hard playing. At least every dota players have a dream.
2. Going FTP is not a bad move imo but bear in mind that people who bought this game might get triggered. (maybe compensate with some packs or certain things that equivalent to the game cost might help as we are the player that actually supported this game from the very beginning) (to be honest, many people regret buying it)
3. Everyone makes mistake, but i think valve is smart enough to figure how to recover this game.
4. Dont let the community down.

I will still support people to buy this game. The game value is there. 


Previous Review. 
Although this game was pretty bad when it launched but the game is consistently improving. Give the developer a thumb and i will recommend this game for it. You can start grind now!
Great game! Most skill-based card game on the market, progress and skill improvement are extra rewarding and the existence of a market place to finish decks without grinding for a very low price make this game very accessible for newer players. One of the best card games on the market!
Deep and immersive game, the production quality is great for a relatively accessible game. The initial cost is low, the maintenance cost is high but you can still sell the cards bought for a fraction of the cost. Overall an enjoyable game

Update: With a renewed support from Valve and commitment to make this game alive in the longer-term, I believe the game has reached a status where I will play it on and off, so therefore definitely worth the price !
It isn't a CCG, but a TCG which should help frame your expectations of price. The game should flush out the trading part wtih friends but that is not a huge issue for now. 

The plus side of the market is that all the stuff from other games I stopped playing can feed into the cheap cards. If you want to go as F2P as possible, sell old comestics from other games that are collecting dust. As a former MTG guy, 19 bucks for a card you only need one of is great.
Don't listen to the 14 year old memers on the internet parroting what morons on Reddit regurgitate over and over to justify the existence of some other card game that isn't this one.  This game is excellent.  This is easily the deepest and most strategic card game on the market and it's pathetic that people try to ruin it because of either ignorance or loyalty to another game.  

This game costs $20.  Wow, can you believe it!  A game that costs money!  After you pay your $20 you never have to spend another dime if you just want to play featured events or casual draft modes.  Literally no other card game has a free draft mode.  Not to mention you don't have to gamble to hopefully get the cards you want by buying card packs, instead this game has a demand-based marketplace where you can buy single cards and 97% of the cards cost pennies.  This is literally the cheapest card game to play if you want to play constructed.

The idea of having heroes and items is revolutionary in this genre.  Simply by changing your item deck or your hero line up or the order they deploy in can have a dramatic effect on the nature of the deck you're playing.  Having a Sorla Khan vs a Bounty Hunter in a black/red deck completely changes the decks win condition and identity.

This is a game that absolutely rewards skill and foresight.  It's easy to blame luck or match ups for your losses but it's always possible to play around bad match ups, bad early games, or 50/50s not going your way.  I don't feel this way about most other card games but this is absolutely the case with Artifact.

This game is fantastic and it's only going to get better and better as more sets are released, more mechanics are revealed, and the already deep nuances deepen further.  Don't be fooled by the ignorant, the hateful, and the stupid.  This is the best CCG on the market.
Artifact is a great game! I only play the draft mode, but I love the complexity and the fact that all matches feel close. Even after a really rough start you can come back through good strategic decisions. I know some people don't like the RNG, but once you learn to think in terms of EV it is just another layer of strategy. I highly recommend Artifact to players of other CCGs like Magic or Hearthstone.
By far the best card game in the market.
The game has a lot of decision making that makes matches really intense and favour the player with an higher skill level.

Don't listen to people that says games are decided by RNG, they simply don't understand the complexity of the game.
Cheating death it's the only card with RNG that may need a rework, but still I don't feel any of my wins/losses has been decided by this card.

If you are a competitive person you will love this game and if you are more on the casual side you will have infinite free hours of draft games and in game events to enjoy.

Artifact will be even better with the upcoming features and expansions, I can easily see myself playing this game for a long time.
So I want to give you a clear reason why I'm giving Artifact a thumbs up.

PLEASE LISTEN TO ITS POSITIVE ASPECTS.

I am used to f2p CCG's, all of them, HS, Gwent, TES Legends, Shadowverse etc and each has its own rank ladder, cosmetics and a bunch of Grinding to be number one on the leader board. While I play them I sometimes forget why I play card games in the first place.

Artifact has a real comic book store, table top TCG feel to it. You can sit down and talk with your opponent while you play and discuss the meta, the state of the game you both love and some weird combo's you are trying while having a friendly laugh while you at it. I remember why I love card games everytime I jump into a game of Artifact! Whether you win or lose it doesn't matter, you and the person you played with get some XP that contribute to a few packs every other week. There is no stigma about being number one or not losing. And no struting around showing off your huge ego with borders and titles.

While other card games try to make your experience rewarding by giving you tons of packs worth not a cent or meaningless cosmetics to show off, Artifact brings you back to the very reason we all enjoy TCG's.

The playtime in Artifact and the experience of it is the reward!
Fantastic game. Complex and engaging turns. Close games with lots of ways to come back. You'd have to be a complete idiot to complain about the monetization and I see that there are plenty.
I absolutly adore this game.
Every match seems to be different and exciting - the three lane system is a blast and you have to think again..
You can play pretty much forever if you just buy the game, don't let the poor reviews from the launch of the game fool you.
This game is marketed towards an older Generation -> ENJOY!
complex and fun game, lots of descion making, and influnce.
the oppsite of hearthstone current meta (boomsday) in my opinion. 

also if u dont buy packs and just buy the cards u want, its not that expensive...
For me it is hard to decide if this is strategy or card game. Its a card game in which you play one game for one hour. And its a card game but it isnt. It is weird but maybe it is better to think about this as strategy rather than card game. from  the 9 times i played my friend with preconstucted decks starter + call of arms, i havent had feeling that i am playing a CCG/tcg weird. It has paid model but you musnt pay a penny after that because you can play draft or any preconstructed/constructed deck for free. Even if this cost 18 e you get your value straight back. I dont know so far i like this game, but i want progression system. Doesnt need to be cards. I would love to grind for skins for example
Its a good card game. If your ok with not being ranked and drafting then you can spend the $20 and get a ton of value from the game. If not well the aftermarket prices are dirt cheap compared to many other CCGs. 

 Ignore 90% of the negative reviews.. most of them are from people who purchased the game without looking up anything about the game modes and expected to get cards for free from playing because yea thats how all card games have to work. Watch a one of the hundred youtube videos about the game modes and whats avaialble to you before purchasing..
So, this is my first time writing a review for any game ever. I felt compelled to write it because this game gave me some mixed feelings. First off, I am a long time MTG player (12 years) and can say this: this card game is AMAZING. Strategy is well rewarded and planning is essential to victory. Let me just emphasize that the game is GREAT. The thing that I see most people complaining about is the monetization shceme that Valve seems to be employing. Honestly, coming from MTG where competitive decks are 200-2000 dollars, spending 40$ max for a tier 1 deck does not seem that bad, especially since in Hearthstone (if you didn't want to grind for literall 100's of hours) getting a T1 deck would cost around 200-500$ dependant on luck. Compare this card game to MTGO (Magic the Gathering Online) and you'll see that the layouts are similar. The community determines the price of a card based upon demand. Axe is currently in the most demand at a whopping 14$ (nothing... compare that to a 70$ Tarmogoyf in MTG). Overall, this game is exactly what I was looking for and will be attempting to become competitive in it. Valve gimme sponsor for my good review plz.
I am enjoying this so much its so good to have a nice and complex TCG and with the Dota lore makes it perfect. I have played around 20 hrs on the beta on another account and was enjoying the free modes without spending a cent but now i have my own account im interested in building some decks in constructed.
This game is incredibly fun! The gameplay is succinct and tight, packed with the strategic decision-making of chess, the card-game boardstates similar to Magic the Gathering, and all wrapped up in the lore and theme of Dota 2. This game is made for the niche market of people who like to buy cards for a quality card game experience, and I cannot recommend this enough as someone who came from MTG.
First review I am writing for a game, but decided to do so because the economy related reviews.
 
This game is cheaper than any of the competitors especially if you account that you can sell your cards to make your next deck. It is completely feasible to have an initial investment and then just sell and buy whatever you want forever which is impossible in other digital TCGs and nobody makes reference to it. Then there's the free drafts that are just insane value for the people that can't spend more money.

I have been playing TCGs for years (15+) and feel like this one will be my main one for the forseeable future. Before this game came out, I was spending 2 hours at night playing MTGA because of the rewards even though I wasn't enjoying myself. To get a competitive deck without this mindless playing for rewards I would have to spend so much more money than what I have to in this game it's not even close. 

The game is deep and fun and brilliant but not for everyone, it is complex, decisions take time to reveal its true consequences and separating losses from RNG from missplays is harder. You can play without paying more than the initial buy and if you end up paying you will be paying less than any other TCG. Yes it does not give free cards and that is something that will make other games more accessible to some people but if you compare what you get from spending money in this game versus the others this economy is just so much better. If you like card games and want to dedicate time to get good (and don't want to spend a fortune to be competitive!) this game is for you.
Amazing game, very deep and engaging gameplay where instead of turns players pass initiative (more akin to the stack in MTG than turnbased ccgs such as HS, TESL, or Shadowverse.) While the base set is somewhat limited it is just a base set and a very fun one to boot. People are upset about the monetisation but I much prefer it as I enjoy the fact I can purchase the card I need in order to finish my deck rather than having to grind for hours and get lucky with a pack pull or having to dust/disenchant my other cards at a 4-1 deficit. If I ever decide to quit the game I can always just cash out and get steam wallet funds. I have sadly stopped playing HS, TESL, and Shadowverse and those are all games where I will never get my money back.
A very polished experience. Gameplay is great, and feels fun early but you know you can improve if you try hard. Better with friends than solo. You can play infinite free phantom draft, 6 free prebuilt decks in an event mode and you get 2 base decks with purchase on top of your 10 packs. Worth it for the $20 and done or worth it to spend money and enjoy the other aspects the game has to offer like competetive constructed or draft.
This review will get expanded when I'm deeper in, but for the moment I just want to say, that casual draft is fantastic. The drafting itself is complex and fun and even allows tweaking between matches - and man, the matches themselves are fun. In 4 hours (that did include the tutorial aswell so maybe 3) I haven't had a single match that didn't have me on the edge of my seat, doing mental gymnastics trying to out play my opponent. Only complaint right now is that there's no damn "GG" I can give my opponent after a great match.

One warning, that's probably unneccesary since half the reviews are about that topic: Read up about the economy before buying or you might not understand are/or like what you see in game.
I think this game is getting too much flack for its payment model. All they've done is get rid of the illusion of free progression that other online TCGs have. The marketplace and unique nature of almost every card makes you want to collect more, and gives a sense of community and collectability that physical cardgames give. This is, in essence, a Magic style TCG reinvented to take advantage of the virtual platform. I do have some gripes about some annoying mechanics that, while fun to use, can be very annoying to play against and other overpowered cards/mechanics. This seems to just be growing pains that will hopefully be ironed out as the game evolves with new expansions and balancing patches. Overall, I think it's a good game that has a chance to build a great community. It has a bit of a harsh learning curve, but I would recommend any TCG fan to give the game a shot, and you can always refund after playing the tutorial matches.
Mostly players gave this game a "Not reccomended" rating did not understand a card game's business model. I played card games from Pokemon to Hearthstone and other card games, and yes it does cost TONS of dollars to play with full satisfaction (full collections of cards). TBH, Artifact is expensive to be played with full experiences, it dug a hole in my wallet, and i'm happy with it. And so does other card games i played like Hearthstone, dugged holes in my wallet since beta, now still playing with almost full collection (I'm broke now :( ). 

Oh yeah, phantom draft, for free, is the best place for me to play on. Learn to draft a deck and play for free. To those who love this game, but doesnt wanna spend money on constructed, this is the place for you. No one in that mode has the best drafted deck and its all based on luck again lul. Its fun! 

Gameplay: I love the mechanics and tactics of this game, it causes brainstorming just like other card games too. playing 3 boards is what makes this card game different from others. But the RNG in this game is strong especially deployment section where you pray hard that your creeps blocking the enemies from hitting your tower and your hero blocking your opponent's hero and minions from attacking. Additionally, 40 cards per deck, causes you to pray even more harder for your next draw cuz most games i played ends early (Thanks aggro). Again, I hope this game in the future does not promote mostly on Aggro decks, but more on controls. Aggro is antifun:(

Summary: It is expensive to those who have never experienced card games. Most negative reviews are those Dota players who never spent money on it (cosmetics for example) or single player fanbois. But once you understand how card game business model works, you'll feel appreciated about how Valve handle their tactics of selling and letting community to sell their cards. Artifact is fun and RNG based game, just like Hearthstone and other card games, RNG is king.
Will i spend more money on it, absolutely. Do i support this game to be free to play, not yet, but paying 20USD for this game is too much for launch of it, but do note u get packs and tickets for you to start on. If they didnt include those freebies in it, It would be a let down for all of us. 7.5/10

Also the music, 10/10. I'm a doggie, I'm a little doggie...


The best card game i ever played. It started with mayor problems and set backs, but Valve is showing the confidence many of us gave them was warranted, as they already change their philosophy after being shown they were mistaken. 

Give the game a chance, the first few hrs might be weird, specially if you come from other card games, but after that the game clicks with you and everything makes sense, even things you might at first think were horrendous (like arrows, creep spawn, etc)
I honestly don't see what the bad Rep is about, great for players who are new to card games.
And ya don't have to play Dota 2 to enjoy it.

10/10 IGN XD
Artifact is a fantastic card game with lots of depth and interesting mechanics. The game originally launched pretty barebones, but with the most recent update it shows Valve is moving in the right direction. We have somewhat of a skill ranking system, and a way of progressing towards packs/tickets. I also like being able to buy a specific card that I want through the market, rather than hoping to get it from a pack/disenchanting cards to craft one. This game will only get better with time, and I highly recommend it!
You constantly get to make interesting decisions, and every game feels in your control. I havent had to pay any money after I initialy bought the game, the monitization will wind up costing you LESS than hearthstone or MTG would. Really fun and feels like a whole new tcg experience.
I really want to play this game more and more... But I think I will get bored while playing only few heroes I got, and I just cant spend any more money on this... I would grind it whole day if it would allow me to get more cards... But with this system, there is literally no way for me to get more cards... Soo thats the only reason I dont recomend it, if they change that, game would be great!

I reccomend it now... This was my old opinion... They changed it... Thanks Valve!
Game is awesome, fair monetization model. Why are you not playing already? The latest card game from Richard Garfield, the creator of Magic the Gathering, in collaboration with Valve, is a masterpiece from day one. Plus, it really does feel like you are controlling a whole team in a turn based game of Dota 2 if you are already a fan.

Compared to playing Magic online or Hearthstone, the Steam market makes this feel very fair. You can spend as little as you want buying cheap cards to round out your collection without even making your way to the local card shop. You aren't locked in to random pack opening. If you are a Steam gamer you can even get real value back by selling your cards and buying a Steam game you would have bought anyway. Or if you are like me you can sell Dota 2 items in the past to buy a Steam Link on sale, then sell the Steam Link at a profit to buy Artifact.

Overall it just feels way more fair than Blizzard or EA simply by having an open market. Add on to that the paid game modes, where all your opponents will definitely care about every match, because they paid to enter that competition. The action, stress, risk and rewards are all balanced in a way that feels great. You get real rewards for playing well, that have real value thanks to the Steam market. It feels like the best of both worlds, digital card games and physical card games.
After 25h gameplay:

With the new Patch 1.2 the Artifact team addressed some of the major problems.
The game is a lot better now, but I'm still missing a ranked / ladder system...

[h1]Positive[/h1]
[list]
    [*] You can buy and sell cards on the market
    [*] Unique DOTA inspired gameplay
    [*] Free Tournament Mode
    [*] Free Draft Mode
    [*] Avatars added (Patch 1.2)
    [*] Axe, Drow and Cheat death have been nerfed, the meta is now much more balanced. (Patch 1.2)
    [*] You get 15 free card packs and 15 free tickets just by playing the game. (Patch 1.2)
[/list]
[h1]Negative[/h1]
[list]
    [*] In order to play expert mode you need to buy tickets for 0.90€ or craft a ticket by recycling 20 common cards (~0.80€) and unless you win 3 out of 5 maches you get no rewards in other words lose the money you paid for the ticket
    [*] No ranked system
    [*] Hero and creeps placement is random and often game deciding
    [*] No card backs
   [*] Artifact only buys the nerfed cards back for the best price of the 24h period berfore the change, this way you can lose a lot of money if you buy the good cards to early...
   [*] The Artifact team also said that they will NOT offer a buyback for future nerfed cards, which means that you can lose a ton of money if you buy for example a good card of the next expantion for high amounts of money and then 3 weeks later they decide to nerf it.... 
[/list]
Very complex but well crafted product. Sure, it might scare newcomers with it's monetization system...but I believe in time they will adress all the issues... in order to make it a win-win situation for everyone.
Good Card game
Don't listen those poor people.
You not have to buy a packs to be good. What also you can do play a casual drafts train your skill.
Then move to expert draft where you those tickets if you win 3 games you get packet it is queit fair because if you learn the game that will be easy for you
pros:
-complex mechanics allowing players to get more skilled and to outsmart opponents in several different ways
-most beautiful card game to date 
-cheaper than hearthstone
-free draft mode
-events with premade decks
-tournaments

cons:
-no ladder (yet?)
-pricetag (altho you get its price worth on packs + 2 decks)
-steam tax feels unfair as it takes value from your collection if you decide to use the market for trading
-my friends wont pay cause its paid


People act like every game should be free. Pay the $20 to play a great game. If you don't want to spend any more money then don't. You probably spent more money on some garbage tier game that you played for a few hours and never picked up again. Watch some videos to see if you like the game before you buy. It's $20...if you think the price is too steep then play 1 of the other free TCG.
A fun take on the TCG. The lane and hero mechanics make lead to some interesting matches. 

The pay model may seem steep, but as a magic the gathering player packs and singles are just the way things are, and its a system that allows you to sell cards to build new decks. 

If you are looking for an interesting card game to play, this is worth a shot.
This game is really good if you like card games with a bit of strategical depth.

The drafts are really fun and the games feel different every time. Playing 3 lanes is surprisingly interesting and the game is pretty easy to jump into if you are familiar with trading card games.

For those who are bandwagoning with the "monetization is unacceptable", what kind of monetization model you would actually play with? I know everything would be awesome to have free but these games cost money to make so you need to pay for them. This game is very cheap unless you want to play constructed with the most expensive deck available. If you want to just draft (phantom drafts) you get hundreds of hours of gameplay before you reach 60$ spent that you could spend on unfinished AAA title. The game is also alot cheaper than some of its competitors.

I hope this game will do well and that we will see big tournaments for it in the future.
Review bombers claim to be professors in economics. Game hasn't even gone a week yet and prices are already dropping on some of the best cards. Take the downvotes with a grain of salt.
Without spending money, or using Tickets (which cost money) it is impossible to acquire new cards. So you start out, open your ten card packs, and those are the only cards you'll ever have for the rest of the game. Because there's no progression system of any kind, there's no real reason to play the game. It's like a real world TCG, but without any of the social aspects, nor the actual ownership of physical cards. 

I wouldn't recommend this game to literally anyone.

12/22 UPDATE: So it looks like the backlash resonated with Valve. There's now a leveling system with rewards, and some of the worst RNG cards have been rebalanced to avoid ridiculous coinflip strategies. While there's still some work to be done, this is a good start, Recommendation changed.
This is why valve is one of the best devs out there. Pretty much every criticism of the game on release (lack of balancing, no progression/ranking system, no way to get packs without paying) has been dealt with.
I don't mind the inital cost for the game, it seems fair
but event tickets should be cheaper, like half the cost

At least there is a free draft mode so I dont have to waste event tickets practising.

All the bad reviews are from people who have no intrest in the draft mode, which is actually pretty dope. Would not recomend this game if you are only interested in constructed play.
Like any tcg that I am aware of, cost for constructed play is obscene and proably only worth if you are making money from playing (ie streaming/entering tournaments). (although after wiriting this I see that the card market is stabalising and it shouldn't cost that much to get the cards you need for a constructed deck.)

They never will (and never should) give away tickets/cardpacks because it would destroy the market value of the cards.
If ya dont want to put more money in than the inital game cost play casual draft, simple as that.


I've only played a few games but it has been fun so far, more engaging than HS but not crazy inacsessible like dota.
The aesthetic is really nice and no compromises have been made to allow for some kind of shitty mobile port

While there is a huge amount of stuff you can try and keep track of to make better plays, I don't think its overwhelming though. The basics are prety straight forward and you pick thinks up steadily as you play games.
Probably worth watching some streamers play both draft and constructed to to accelarate the learning.
At it's core an excellent game. Pays for itself.

Hindered slightly by the balance/design of some cards and the absence of a ranking system.

Edit: This dev team shows great promise, now it's just an excellent game.
I think I will just stick with monitization for this review as that is what most people care about.
1st - When you buy the game you get over 25 dollars worth of value so it isn't completly wastful but makes the curve to play harder
2nd - $20 is the only amount that you need to spend on this game to enjoy the vast majority of the content. With the addition of a casual phantom draft you don't need to own any cards.
3rd - Decks cost way less. In Hearthstone you need to spend a ton of money on packs just to get cards and then disenchant half of your collection. While in artifact you can just buy a deck for like $5 using the community market. Also I understand you can get free packs in HS but that takes a ton of grind which a lot of people including me don't have time for. As a f2p player I think artifact overall has a cheaper and more enjoyable model.
4th - Packs give you 12 cards and a guarenteed rare (the highest rarity card) so you can build your collection up much more.
5th - This game is really fucking fun that even if you pay more you get what you paied for.

Good game. Had a lot of fun playing Call To Arms and later Constructed. I haven't gotten into draft because it seems complicated. My only gripe was playing against the same cards over and over -> Axe and Drow especially. 

With the Build Your Legend update, that's no longer the case. Valve is willing to balance the game, nerfing powerful heroes and importantly, buffing the ones that aren't being played at all. Before this I didn't even know Outworld Devourer was in the game because I had never seen it play or heard anyone talk about using it. I'm sure with today's buff (and possibly ones in future), I'll actually see that card in action.
i kennot believe my self to enjoy this game, im really not into card games pretty much because im just bad understanding how ever cards work, now i played DOTA 1 in my younger days and im pretty much know a bit and im just really a casual gamer.fun fact this is my first time playing card games, never in mylife to think i will be addicted so much with this game, even my friend is weirded out me playing CARD GAME?! but yeah in summary love this game. i just keep saying everyone saying i play DOTA so yeah XD
I am skeptical at Artifact at first. Initially I found it unnecessary at the start. 

But now that I've tried it. It's amazing. The gameplay is nothing that I have played before and every match is as nailbiting as the previous one. 

THey initially had problems with progession and card balancing. But since then they have updated the game and have thought of a different philisophy in balancing the game. 

BOTTOMLINE: 

If you play Hearthstone or MTGA but feel that its lackign complexity play Artifact. 


Fun game that has a high level of complexity. The pay to win aspect is being overblown by many people, the cards that you intially get when you buy the game can be sold and from that money you will most likely have enough to buy the deck you want. There are a few cards that are outside of this range but they are not required to be good. Just know that card games are not for everyone.
I Love this game, very well balanced and has alot of depth that rewards the sharp minded player. Ignore the negative reviews from kids that can't comprehend that the game isn't free to play.
Funny how the only bad thing people can say about it is "You have to pay money! what?! money?! for a video gmae?!?!"

Really great game if you love card games. If you don't love card games it might be a bit complex for most players.
Even more RNG than Hearthstone. You can instantly lose turn 1 just based on where heroes are placed automatically. There's too many variables that can instantly make you lose, and it will lead to you getting salty.

However, if you don't get screwed over by RNG, and both sides are as lucky or unlucky, then it's a fair game. 

7/10 would get salty again
Already the friendliest card game monetiziation before the progression patch, it's even better now. 

I find the gameplay second to none in the carg game genre. A very deep and complicated game, most of my games are down to the wire and exciting. I feel like every game I lose I could have won with the right choices, and games I win feel like I outmaneuvered my opponent. I think this'll get even better with more cards and balance patches.

The ability to spend pennies instead of my time to aquire cards is so refreshing. I might be an outlier in that I usually get at least my money back from prize play, but I find reasons to play every mode, from free draft, constructed, prize gauntlets, tournaments, precon and more.

Would definitely recommend grabbing a couple friends too (or join a discord) so you can goof around in chat or voice during games, super fun.
This game is dense, rewarding, and fun. The best online card game I've played, and I started playing them before magic even had their own online program. It has so much potential, as well.

Speaking of which, here's an idea -> what if there were items that were always available for purchase by either player? You could set a minimum price. Say three Town Portal Scroll, three Demagicking Maul, three Jasper Daggers. I picked these because they counter various strategies. Say $5 is the minimum price. Here's the twist -> you can outbid your opponent. So, if you're deck is based on silencing heroes you may want to buy out all three Jasper Daggers, or if you rely on improvements you would want to try to buy out Demagicking Maul. This would lead to some interesting strategic decisions. It would also create a design space for counters and balancing that does not completely kill specific strategies.
The core gameplay is excellent, with RNG handled as well as I've seen a CCG do. Sure, I lose most of my matches, but I can almost always point to mistakes I made either in my deck construction/drafting or in my decisions during the game that led to my defeat.

I already thoroughly enjoyed it before the latest update, but the balance changes and implementation of ranking and progression are just icing on the cake.

Free draft mode is by far my favorite way to play. Well worth picking up!
Hey, I played yugioh competitively back in the day,  and toyed with MtG aswell over the years but couldnt commit due to the costs. 

If you compare this game to yugioh, mtg, any other physical card game, this game is actually very VERY affordable! You don't enter paid local tourneys 20 times a day, and that's the difference, if you treat this like a physical card game where you just play friendlies and deck test and stuff, and then compete 2-3 times a week the whole system actually makes boat loads of sense!

GAMEPLAY: This is by far the most rewarding experience i've had playing any card game EVER.  You have so many opportunities to make decisions throughout a match, that the victory (or defeat) feels very personal, and unfortunately that isn't  always the case in other games. And this is from someone who topped plenty of events so I'm wasnt just a sore loser haha. Ive actually lost most of my games of artifact but again, it's so rewarding it feels good either way!
I enjoy trying out new card games i do, so i thought id give the game a shot  and here are my thoughts.
First of all i like the gameplay its unique to have three boards instead of the usual one board that we all know.
Theres alot of new stuff to learn: Cards, improvements, spells and heroes its all looking good
so far.
I just need to see some way for them to change the fact that players that don't have enough money to buy packs need in game currency to make the games more replayable, cause doing a match to earn nothing, no new cards or anything it feels a bit underwhelming but atleast i got the packs as promised, but i do hope for the sake of the future of this game getting big not to make trading your collection and throwing in money the only way for different gameplay.
Fun and innovative gameplay, some people dosen't like the game's monetization, but i quite like it. If I want to play a deck, then I just buy the cards, instead of buying alot of packs and crossing my fingers.
Artifact is hands down the best card game on steam and the fact that you can trade cards and purchase packs is fantastic. A lot of people are complaining about that but in any card game you need to buy cards and trade to build the deck you want. You can also use pre made decks if you do not  want to spend any money or deal with trading. The new ranking system is great and you can ear card packs for free by ranking up or winning event matches. This new major update that just came out fixed almost all of the negative complaints people were making. Valve is starting to listen to their customers and this is a grea example of that. A lot of people are also mad that Valve made a card game and not a game like LFD or Half Life 3 etc. But Valve is working on it, they are getting things ready so the day those games do come out, they are ready to blow peoples mind. Anyway if your looking for  a card game to play, this is it. Dont let the negative feedback change your mind.
Regarding the price: you can play phantom draft as many times as you want without ever paying for packs or more cards, you can now play tournaments with commons, and they provide like 10 prebuilt decks which are all pretty cool to play with as well. That's a lot of content for the price, AND they're adding more features

Regarding RNG: if you actually get upset from the creep spawns and aggro, then you're probably playing this game wrong to begin with. You can't possibly plan to win only if everything goes in your favor. The creep spawns and aggro make games varied, and make you plan ahead. It's not a bad mechanic, but I can see how it frustrates people who expect the RNG to go in their favor every time like children.

Gameplay: It has a lot of depth. Every game feels like different decisions could have led to different outcomes. The three lanes add amazing layers to the game, like playing heroes in your first lane with global spells or mobility spells. Which lane you decide to win could be game winning or losing based on which lane your opponent is going for. Base racing for ancient is super exciting and satisfying. I really like this game
After the initial cost of 20 bucks for 2 starter packs, 10 expac and 5event tickets, the Game provides pre made decks for to check out for free,  casual play is entirely free, and the hard bots are harder and better than human opponents without the AI using hacks.

I spent less than 40 bucks now and I'm already am having fun playing with bots and trying out weird combos. 

Did I mention the graphics and sound design is absolutely gorgeous?

Most f2p games are only free to enter, but pay to stay due to how time consuming the grind is for people who actually have a daily routine. I used to be able to clear shadowverse and duelyst dailies only to realize they take up way too much time and to win you actually need good decks ( or good skill, but most people don't have good skill so the devs are banking on that )

This game is absolutely worth the money.
Much better than Hearthstone, nice feel to this game, I can sit and play this without getting bored or annoyed compared to Hearthstone. People complaining about buying packs and because "microtransactions", but you can buy the packs, or buy the cards over steam market, or trade them. Sell the ones you have, trade to friends. All those Hearthstone peeps be mad they have spent 100s on the game and can't sell/trade cards.   This game 9/10 for me.
I think it's a really good game. It's a shame that people have trashed it over the monetisation model; there may be no way to earn cards reliably through play (paid gauntlets don't count!) but then again the typical starter set is going to contain some valuable cards anyway; the vast majority of cards you need are three cents, the minimum on the Steam marketplace.

What it currently lacks is positive feedback mechanisms for when you win. None of the casual modes do anything to reward the player when she wins. You need to feel like you won =something= when you spend 30 mins of your time. Like, ascending the ladder in Hearthstone. A nice positive feedback loop that makes you care about playing again. Right now that just isn't there, but the core game is awesome.
worth the 20 bucks. Everyone that is complaining are just a bunch of dumbasses expecting a profit from winning, even if u didnt want to spend 2 bucks for a pack you could just buy the cards you want or just play phantom draft. You only need to spend more than 20 bucks only IF you want to.
Fun game, so much to think about when playing which gives a great challenge to every move you make. Cards are not that expensive and you do not need to buy any to have fun with this game. Not sure what all the whining is all about.

If you are a fan of dota this is worth a purchase.
As a life-long TCG fanatic, I can safely say this is one of the best digital TCGs I've ever played.
Unlike other digital TCG/CCGs (Heartstone, MTGA, etc) this one has actual options for casual play, including a phantom draft.
The community market makes it genuinely feel like a real-life TCG in a way that only MTGO has ever matched, without having to deal with the horribly clunky MTGO UI.
As for the actual card game itself? It's surprisingly complex for how new it is, there's even actual benefit to playing a defensive strategy, unlike almost every other TCG, digital or otherwise.
I'm going to change this review to a cautious recommendation in light of the recent patches. Particularly Valve's decision to take a more active approach to card balancing is going to make a massive positive difference for Artifact in the future. Blue is still a very unbalanced color, having both the most overpowered swarming spells as well the only board wipes needed to clear them, but as balance changes are likely made based on tournament results, I'm confident this too will be addressed over the coming weeks.

The game still does have a lot of, in my opinion unnecessary, RNG elements. I would personally prefer non-random hero deployment and arrows to be straight by default, allowing them to be directed sideways through card effects, but at least Valve seems to have realized the swingy RNG from card effects needs to be mitigated because Cheating Death has already been fixed. Furthermore, the amount of new features that have been added in the last three weeks alone are quite impressive.

Overall, still a decent amount of issues to sort out but the game is already much more enjoyable than it was on release and Valve's efforts deserve some positive feedback.
I’ve had a lot of fun playin over the last two days. Winning has been really rewarding and I have seen a lot of variety in the decks I am playing against.
Overcame the seeming overcomplexity after about 10 games. There is some depth here, but too early to tell how much.  Seems a solid foundation assuming future sets.

For me the economy is a benefit. Recouped half the game cost on mediocre opens, looking like I can draft near infinitely at like 65% win rate.
I like being able to get the deck I want easily and not crazy expensive. Obviously Axe, Drow, etc. are good and expensive, there are other ways to enjoy the game. If you're good it's quite easy to go infinite on expert modes too.
It's a fun, tough game that isn't like any other card game I've tried before. The games can be longer than other digital card games (15-45 minutes) but I find the moment to moment decision making enjoyable. The gameplay is complex and a little more dense than other card games with 3 boards to manage and what not, but I don't feel overwhelmed. 

It does feel like I'm playing an abstracted version of Dota2, which is great for a guy like me who grew up playing those games but doesn't have the time or inclination (or let's be real, the reactions and skill) to play that kind of game anymore. 

I'm not a hardcore card game player, but I do like to get together with friends and run a Magic draft every month or so. Being able to pick up a game and run unlimited draft tournaments with my friends is amazing, and probably why this game works for me! 

If you are a fan of strategy games and card games I'd highly recommend this.  Thanks for reading!
UPDATE!: The game has introduced a way for players to get free cards through weekly bonus XP, but once you get your account to level 18 (i think) you don't get any more cards. Also, the prices of the cards have dropped but a fuck load which is great. Also there was a massive wave of card balances which made the game a lot more fun and fair.

The game is still fun and i'm sad to see it still dying. I've been thinking about what Valve has done wrong and one thing that really comes to mind now is their bad distribution of the Beta keys. Think about other games coming out Developers, Indie or AAA, send their beta keys or test keys out to influencers and big gaming youtubers to kick start their games success. What did Valve do? They sent their Beta keys mainly to Dota 2 personalities, which did nothing because Dota 2 is a free to play game with a large player base which might not be able to spend a lot of money on a game plus P2W items.

Valve still has time to advertise, but they probably won't.


(OLD REVIEW)
Artifact is extreamly broken, i'll start with the pros first because there are too many cons. Im still very hopfull for a super good update but Valve has been very silent so far.

Pros:
-Looks really nice
-If your opponent also does not have a lot of money to spend on cards and shit, the game can be pretty fun
-If you've played dota 2 before, you'll find the way Artifact uses abilities and ultimates pretty fun (Zeus ult and Lich ult 15/10)
-New heros (?)
-New lore

Now the cons:

-Unless you have a shit ton of cash to spend on cards (which you need to have right now), the game is not fun
-WAY too many unbalanced cards, if you don't have Axe/Legion commander, Emissary of the Quorum and Kanna, you will not win. If your opponent has them, you will lose 100%
-No way to get cards for free, there is not progression system or daily quests like Hearthstone has for you to get cards. The only way you can get cards is through Expert play (which you need a £3 ticket for) or you actually buy cards through the market
-REMOVE THE FUCKING IMPHS
-Horrible voice acting for CM
-No way to check your play history
-No way to progress, you do the same thing all the time. Theres no ranked option, expert play is just you pay for a ticket, enter a game, if you win 3 times you get something small, win 5 get some packs, or lose 2 matches and lose a £3 ticket.
-Its very obvious that Valve wants this game to be a money makign esport instead of a fun game.
 
At points, i would be playing and wishing i were actually playing hearthstone.
I will be making edits over the course of the game stating what I think has gotten better, what I like of the changes to the game, and of my outlook on artifact..

BIG THUMBS DOWN. No way to earn more cards without paying money. You get no rewards for winning a match. There's no way to communicate with your enemy, so you might as well just be fighting against a bot.


edit: I will say that this game does have good gameplay and there's a lot of creativity to be had when creating a deck because of the 4 different card colors, but Im still giving the game a negative review. The matches can be a little too long and I think there's a lot of cards that are just stupidly op and it just causes decks to be built around them. On the plus side they recently added a way to communicate with your oppnent, but only after the match is over and I should mention ive also been getting an error everytime I try to communicate will an opponent after a match that it will just not let me communicate with them at all so its really just a pointless added feature for me since it doesnt work.

for instance if you're going against a blue deck you basically HAVE to win before 10 mana or else the blue deck will get an infinite turn and infinite mana because of a few certain cards and its just stupid.

                                                       CURRENT REVIEW

edit: I will be changing my review to a Thumbs Up although I would do a Thumbs Sidesways if I could. The game now has a progession system that will allow players to earn card packs and event tickets for free which is great, but after level 16 you wont be able to unlock any more card packs or event tickets which is not so great and you'll only be able to unlock new potraits. 

They also announced that they will start making direct changes to the stats and abilities of cards which is something that I actually favor and I think it will help the game in the longterm especially, but I can see some people getting upset about it if they bought a card for an expesnive price but then the card got nerfed and they wasted money on said card.

Lastly the best Change they made to the game is they added a way to directly communicate with your oppenent during a match. You can now right click and hold on your tower to open up a dialog whell with also the option to type a message
Artifact is a unique and amazing game, with tons of interesting decisions and exciting games and super rich in flavor, but it asks a lot of its players. The experience is not for everyone. You need to know what experience you are aiming for.
I'm very casual when it comes to competitive card games like this. I'm actually really enjoying it generally especially the complexity and the hero and item mechanics. I did play a bit of hearthstone and I got bored of that and how agressive they are when it comes to spending a lot of money on new expansion packs (I didn't play enough to have a chance of earning anything for free. I just ended up losing cards overall by recycling them to get better cards). I came into this game knowing full well that if I want the best cards i'll need to pay for it. Over time the prices for the cards with decrease anyway as the supply increases. I'm just here for a bit of fun and trying out premade decks for free. You can guarntee that this game will get better with updates so judging its lack of features at this stage is a bit premature. I don't mind spending the £15.99 on it knowing it will improve in the near future.

Pros
Interesting mechanics (3 lanes, items, heroes).
Free access to decks in non-competitive modes.
Probably going to recieve a lot of updates and balancing in the future.
Aesthetics.
Looking at the market place currently there aren't many cards that are super expensive.

Cons
I'm a bit confused on why you can't place your heroes at the start of the game. Would add another layer of strategy. Same with the minions.
There is quite a big element of RNG. Changing the above would lessen that for me. 
The fact you have to press that coin a lot just to end the turn can get frustrating for me sometimes. I know it gives the ability to be reactive on the lane but can be frustrating when trying to set up strategies.

I'm loving the game so far.  There's a lot of complexity in the gameplay, and hopefully that translates into depth in the coming weeks as we explore it more (I have high expectations).

Personally, I like the pricing model of the game, but I think Valve has dropped the ball in communicating how it works.  People are saying it as "pay to win" but it's actually more inexpensive than any other card game I have played.  I am a long time Magic player and have also dabbled in Hearthstone and several other games.  I don't know why people are getting bent out of shape over buying a few event tickets when the real cost of these games is in collecting the cards, and Artifact is not expensive in that regard.

Overall, it's a very exciting game and I think it has a bright future.
This is one of the best card games I have ever played. No loss feels like its due to elements outside of my control. I understand peopels complaints about the pay elements in the game, however, coming from a background in Magic I 1. Do not think that the game is expensive and 2. would much rather not have to grind. 

Other elements not being considered are the fact that all cards you get are sellable and you are always able to play draft more, even for free. You do not have to spend money on this game. 

I think over time the market will calm down and hopefully people will give this game a chance.
Good game, they fixed the pay model and I can buy it for $20 and play draft forever.  Enjoying it quite a bit and it doesn't seem like it will go stale.  There does seem to be too much RNG that can swing the game a ton, which seems to reduce the value of skillful play in limited at least.

Hope they reduce the RNJesus a touch and this will be about perfect.
Each match of artifact is a delightful experience and very thrilling as you feel you are always 1 turn away from winning or losing. The game has a very nice presentation which is further enhanced by the sound design and musical score. However, the game launched with some rather questionable design choices regarding game balance and monetization and thankfully Valve has been quick to fix them.
actually a fun card game.

like dota it can be frustrating at the start, but its not as hard to learn.
i recommend playing the pre-constructed decks before starting to mess with your own decks.

once you got a knowledge of all cards you can still play draft for free.

however constructed is pay2win and there is no way to grind cards for free unless you gamble and go infinite with your tickets/packs in the prize modes.

other than that there is enough room to play and enjoy the game without buying more cards than the starter decks you get (you can still play with cards you dont own in draft mode and with the pre-constructed decks that come with each card release).
This is honestly a really good card game. the negative reviews are only because you have to pay for the game, when in reality you're mostly buying the 10 packs which is 120 cards total and 5 event tickets which is $5. When i purchased the game i also got a month of Dota Plus so all together I got essentially $30 worth of content for $20.

Heres the thing, nothing is truely free. If the game was free to play, but you got nothing to start with then people would complain more than paying just paying the $20 for what essentially is a beginner's pack, which is something that other online card games like Hearthstone offer .Now yes, there is a portion of the game that is "pay to win" but it's a card game... literally every single card game is pay to win. where Artifact stands out is it gives you free decks to play with, a free draft mode, along with tolerable bots to train with. So, a smart player would look at these options and use the tools given by the game to get better and understand the game and how to build a good deck, and then use the event tickets given to you to go play a draft where you could earn more tickets and packs. Alternatively, if you save two packs and a ticket and you feel confident in your knowledge of the game, you can try the Draft that allows you to keep all the cards you drafted in addition to packs and tickets.

is the game perfect? absolutely not. Is it fun? absolutely. I have yet to regret this purchase. so far i've been understanding how to draft better, and understanding the fundamentals of the game and how cards can work together to make combos. The only thing i would want in the future is some form of a weekly challenge or login bonus that allows players to get a pack or two from a week of playing.

I will say this in addition. I don't feel that this is a game for just anyone. a lot of my enjoyment from this game comes from the lore from the cards and getting to peice together parts of the Dota 2 universe that we are starting to learn. So i feel that if you like Dota 2 and you like card games, then definately try this game out.
Solid, fun, not too expensive. The free modes/decks give you enough to determine which styles you'd like best and then buying cards for those decks are incredibly cheap most of the time, with just a few that are above $1-2 dollars, and again just a few more than $10. Compared to Hearthstone this game is dirt cheap.

Definitely a refreshing and unique approach to an online TCG, enjoy!
On first glance Artifact can look intimidating and complicated but after playing a few games it's pretty easy to understand. It looks good, runs well and Valve have quickly made changes to address peoples issues with the game and I think it will only get better. 

I think as long as you don't open the packs you get when buying you can refund the game if you don't like it but I'm especially enjoying the free phantom draft mode despite not liking drafting in mtga or arena in hearthstone. It nearly always feels like if you'd have just done something differently you could've got the win but figuring out the optimal play is hard!

Card prices are low at least in my opinion so if you want to play constructed it's pretty easy to put together a deck you like the look of or buy the cards you want to make your own deck. I understand why some are against having to buy cards but for me I like the option of buying the cards I want rather than just opening packs and hoping to get some of the cards I need. After the latest update you can earn packs and tickets just by levelling up and what you can earn I think refreshes after a season but it's not known how long a season is yet.

You can get screwed by arrows and/or creep deployments but on the other hand sometimes it can work your way. It forces you to have to change your strategy and adapt so no game ever plays out the same way. RNG yes but every card game has it in some form. 

If Artifact interests you I recommend ignoring the negativity and seeing what you think after having played it.
Its a very fun game to play definitely. You can keep playing casual draft or call to arms indefnitely without spending money. Most reviews here are butthurt with less than 2 hours played, so I think people should watch some streams before making their decision.
This is the first time I review a game because it just feels so important to me. There is no other way for me to say this but I LOVE this game. I've played almost every online card game out there and Artifact is easily the best one among them. Playing this gem has been an absolute BLAST! The intensity of the matches and the decisions you make are just unreal. But what else to expect from designer legend Richard Garfield, the creator of Magic. The artworks are extremely beautiful and so much fun to look at. It has been ages since a strategy game had such a positive impact on me, so thank you Valve! It is also the first time I actually made profit with a game (currently +17€), so basically artifact (for me) is better than free to play (so far). It's a really rewarding feeling to farm those perfect runs and see how much money you saved compared to buying packs. If you are somewhat good, you can endlessly play with your event tickets and grind those packs!!! I mean, which game actually rewards skill with money without being a pro? I understand the mixed feelings about this game, but this, this is really a milestone, an absolute innovation and I am sure this game will dominate the card game pro scene sooner or later.

That being said, the game definitely lacks some core features that should be a must have in this age. Artifact has no progression system whatsoever (except for perfect run counters) and no achievements. It would feel so much better if there also were some kind of cosmetic modifications for the board or foil cards. I would love to sell my rare cards to buy a foil hero card. Also there is no 1 Vs 1 phantom draft, which immediately turned off a friend of mine who had genuine interest in the game. So there is definitely a lot that Valve could have done to make the release better and more accessible to all sorts of players.

So all in all, I can recommend this game to players who have decent skill, enjoy super complex card games and are willing to invest money (to hopefully make more/get cards at discount value). You CAN play this game for free, but the best experience is (for me) in expert play. So for casual f2p card gamers, I would recommend Hearthstone, Gwent or Elder Scrolls Legend over Artifact, simply because of their economic structure and easier gameplay. However, if you want the most challenging online card game experience ever made, buy this game. Enjoy and see you on the battlefield!
A ton of fun to play. The monitization is present, but far less preditory than the likes of something like Hearthstone, and frankly preferable since it lets you get exactly the cards you need through the marketplace instead of praying for good RNG with loot boxes.
Game is a blast, I cannot stop playing it, 10/10

I don't even know where to begin with how much I enjoy this game. Every win/loss feels well within my control. I play primarily Phantom Draft and I already have 61 hours into this game. I have barely even scratched the surface with the amount of game modes there are.

Personally, I would disregard the negative reviews. You'll notice a lot of them have >10 hours played and most are things that are easily fixed later on (season ladder, rewards, card design, etc).

As for people complaining about price: you buy a 'starter pack' in Magic The Gathering/Pokemon/Yugioh, you buy additional packs, you pay for entry to events at your local card store. How is this any different, other than it being digital?
The $20 you pay for the initial hump to get into the game gives 10 packs, 5 tickets, and 2 starter decks. Within the game, that would cost $25, so Valve is trying to give you a start to try out all modes. 

For the initial cost, it does give you a great deal because it allows you to: 
-play the "call to arms" preconstructed mode
-free constructed 
-free phantom draft 
-bots matches
-play against friends 
-enter into any public tournament

If you're trying to build specific decks without trying to gamble by opening packs to find the card you need, or scrapping/dusting the cards to make what you want, then the Steam Market works really well to lower costs to create decks you want. Being able to sell extra cards for steam balance helps to lower some of the costs for the game as well. The only option in a f2p game is to dust/scrap them. Thanks to the market, buying semi-compeitive decks will cost $5-10 to make that are able to win plenty of games against even the most expensive decks if played out well.

I have mixed feelings on their "expert" modes because it seems to just be gambling to try to win more than what you put it. They are the same exact format to the constructed and phantom draft but with a chance to win packs plus your ticket back. It's like playing high stakes poker versus playing poker with your friends with play money. It depends on what people are looking to get invovled with.

In addition, they could have added a few ways to gain packs or tickets for free through ways like a ladder, progression system, or even by winning 5 games in the free modes. It would give people something to set a goal for. Valve currently has the option to recycle 20 cards for one ticket, which is great, but it still costs some sort of money to get the cards. 

The gameplay is very fun though. It is a very unique game that themes well with how Dota plays out. Having to manage three lanes at once adds another layer of depth that gives people more thought. I think there is a lot to learn with this game. However, it's a fairly simple game to start picking up because the interface is very descriptive of everything you're doing, it calculates damage being done, and allows to see where damage is coming from. etc. 

Overall, even with my mixed feelings on Valve's approach to monetizing the game, the gameplay is very fun with a low cost if you don't mind trying to be highly competitive or gamble at any of the "expert" modes. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay out of the intitial cost and a few common/uncommon decks. For anyone deeply into draft modes, the free draft mode alone could have endless hours of gameplay. No one is saying that you have to go and buy all of the cards because there is a lot of fun within the game at a much lower cost than it may seem.
Great card game with a lot of mechanics. It doesn't have the immediate pop of games like Hearthstone, but you'll find yourself addicted very quickly. If you're a fan of advanced card games like MTG, you'll love Artifact.

Regarding the economy, this game is targeting a certain type of player. 

There is no F2P model so people in poor countries or people who can't afford the $20 buy in are going to be mad. People were raging about the lack of F2P option well before the game was even released. 

But if you value your time, it's easy to see that spending $10 for exactly the cards you want on the Steam marketplace is far better than grinding 200 hours in other games for packs that are pure RNG. 

This is not a predatory model. It is a gatekeeping model. You cannot spend $0 on this game and play it forever for free. But you can spend $20 and play draft for free. You can spend ~$10 (at this moment) and get almost all commons/uncommons you want. I value my time a lot and I don't want to have "daily login" quests anymore. I don't have time for that. This game is not for those type of people. This game is for competitive card players who want the ability to buy exactly what they want without RNG.
It's one of the best card games i've played. The monitization system has it's flaws and benefits. You can build competitive abled decks with less than a dollar but you can't earn packs.
Although I just got a CTD on my second ever online match - near the end too, so I lost a lot of game time there .........

I do recommend the game. It's probably the only card game that I've actually wanted to keep playing.

I hear the comments regarding the cost of cards - however, as more of a certain card hit the market then the price comes right down to pennies. No biggie. Seeing as Valve will keep supporting the game with new packs etc - they have to earn money somehow.
I'll keep it simple. 

This game is absolutely worth the 20$ I spent on it. It's cheaper to play than any other TCG and I'm not even a big TCG guy.

You can play unlimited draft modes in queue or with friends in tourneys. 

You get free packs/tickets with the game. You can play ranked with those tickets and constantly earn more packs/tickets if you're good enough (and even make money by selling rare cards you earn from this on the steam market)

I recommend practicing in the free unranked draft before using tickets in ranked though

And most important of all - it's genuinely a fun game. Easily worth 20$
Bought the game on release day, had a blast. It got kinda stale with no progression or ranking systems (rip my dopamine needs). Patch 1.1, good changes, kept me playing. Patch 1.2? That's what I'm talkin about. They listened to the community and changed things for us, yeeeee
i've wasted 40 euros in the game.

17 to get it.

played 20h in the call of arms event, tried all the decks and most of the cards.

loved mono blue

wasted 23 euros to make a deck i love, not by getting packs but cards directly.

And now i am having great fun, and regret nothing.

i HATE the visuals, but the depth in strategy is great. RNG is a factor, beware. As in ALL card games, either poker, MTG or even war ;)

The game needs a lot of development yet....
Very addicting if you like challenging games! I personally don't care about building a card collection and just want to play draft all day. Artifact offers exactly that so it's perfect for me. Highly recommend if you want to do the same. If you're trying to play constructed then expect to pay extra or you will probably have a bad time.
Really like the game, I basically only play free draft, some prize draft and really enjoy it. 
I don't care much about constructed, so i can't speak to that.

Haven't felt the need to pay for anything yet, so i don't mind the monetization mofel.

Really love picking a deck together and trying to optimize it with what's available in draft and can't wait for more cards to drop,
A very fun, complex card game. I was put off buying the game because of the bulk of negative reviews, but they were before the update a few days ago which now lets us earn 15 packs from leveling up, rank up our mmr, but the amount of free packs from purchasing the game reduced from 10 to 5.

You can play with preconstructed / draft decks for free (not needing to own those cards). The event Call to Arms is currently active until 11th January 2019 which consists of 8 preconstructed decks and the option to randomly pick one, each with its own score board of win streaks. (Currently on a 3 win streak with Random)

After reading some recent negative views i will expand a little: There isn't extreme RNG, even if the enemy got the best RNG and you the worst, it won't make you lose. Cards aren't overpowered, they're special ones linked to their hero. You can buy/sell the cards on the market so creating a deck is pretty cheap, but the free ways to play are more fun imho.
Game is really really good, well made and a lot more interactive than other alternatives of card games. With recent patches, it became more enjoyable and every game feels really good. You can win unwinnable games with cheap decks if you play it right and think about every turn.
Great game and Valve have adjusted the most things in patch 1.2 that made people not recommend the game. Still hope Valve will develop the rankingsystem more like CSGO.
Artifact is the best card game I've ever played, MTG and Hearthstone didn't quite reel me in.
It's game mechanics is very fun to me, it takes a lot of learning to get good at Artifact
There has been a lot of negative reviews saying that:

-Artifact is pay to win
-There's no level progression
-You can't earn cardpacks for free

The developers realize this and added:

-A level progression where you earn card packs and tickets when you reach a certain milestone of levels.
-Cards are fixed, nerfed and buffed with each update, making those cards fair and not overpowered.
-You can also earn both cardpacks and tickets from the Prize Play, with the entry fee of one ticket, but you can earn up to 3  tickets, and 3 card packs.
-There's a mode called Phantom Draft, where you draft all your cards, so does your enemy, so all is fair in this mode, I find it quite fun.
-You might have to spend some amount of money for constructed, but you can get the cardpacks for your decks in the Phantom Draft Prize Play.

In conclusion Artifact is one of the best TCG out there, and I highly recommend to look past the negative reviews and get the game.
Fantastic card game that is sadly notably hurt by its business model, but may still be worth it depending on what you want or are willing to pay.

Compared to many well known card games you consistently get to make lots of decisions every match that feel impactful, and this naturally leads to the game having a great amount of depth. Close games feel extremely tense and the only time I've had comparable fun with a card game was the days when Hearthstone was new and interesting. Dota 2 lore fans will also find some very interesting content and pretty cool voicelines and interactions between heroes. There's an in-game tournament system which is very nice for easily playing tournaments with friends or other groups. The ranking system however is in its infancy at the time of this review.
Valve has also shown themselves to be ready to make active balance changes, which is a great thing to finally see utilised in a digital card game. The competing games usually do a very poor job of making use of this big advantage to a digital game.
In my opinion, this is the best digital card game available right now in terms of gameplay.

The primary problem with the game is the business model, which results in the game currently costing about twice as much as I would expect from a game for the full set of cards even if you buy from the steam market(~$120 as of this review). You are given access to some set decks that contain cards outside of your collection that you can trial but this is unconnected to normal constructed mode and you will only play against the other pre-constructed decks.
If you are a draft player then the model isn't so much of an issue, as you can play the casual draft freely, and if you're a good draft player you can steadily build up a collection through the prize draft mode. 
However, the reality is that you are restricted in your play unless you do pay additional money, and if you want everything open to you this will cost more than conventional games.

Comparisons to the prices of other card games are relevant and the basic summary I will give is that this game is cheaper than Hearthstone or MTGA if you want to get all the cards, especially if you want them all immediately without any grinding. If you are good at the game it's probably easier to grind out a full set of cards here than in either of those games too, however getting lots of rewards is tied to playing well so unless you're a high level player don't expect to avoid paying if you want more cards. 
If you are interested in playing a select deck or possibly a few decks then you will still be required to play well or pay in Artifact, whereas the other 2 games mentioned allow you to acquire enough cards easily to play a few decks. A player who is happy to spend a lot of time grinding for cards without needing to play at top levels will find the other games grant you a lot more for free. A player who wants to spend money rather than time will find Artifact the cheaper choice currently.

In conclusion, if you are interested in a high depth card game this will probably be the best choice, barring monetary concerns.
If you are a player who only wants to play draft, or a high level drafter who is ok with building up a collection through grinding draft I would instantly recommend this game. 
If you are fine with paying for the entire collection, using the steam marketplace will make this game cheaper than most high profile card games currently.
If you wish to build up a collection by playing and do not feel confident in your ability to play well or don't wish to have to play well consistently, this game will not be the best choice for you.
Overall this is going to cost you much less then hearthstone. Many people are upset because you have to pay for the game. But it gives cards and tickets to start competitive play with. Not to mention these cards actually hold value on the steam store. I know lots of people want the no ticket modes to give rewards. Tickets are cheap and if your a decent player you never have to put another time into it.
Great game. It has deep mechanics and it can often be difficult to suss out the right line of play. There is very little playing on "autopilot" in this game compared to other card games.
I originally gave this a negative review, though in it I stated there were many positives and things to like about the game, but that the downsides outweighed the positives.


With the last patches and the direction the game is headed in now I can say that I feel much better about recommending it.  It is a deep TCG, with a lot of moving pieces and things going on, but very rich and rewarding gameplay.  There are still some downsides (the market) and some things to be aware of though they are really "negatives" (game length and depth), but it really is a game I've enjoyed sinking a lot of time into.
Artifact has kept me stuck to the the screen, shaking and incredibly satisfied. The gameplay is the best I've experienced in a cardgame, people complaining about the monetization model are sort of clueless and if that's what's keeping you from spending 20$ on a game that you can easiliy put hundreds of hours into with no additional costs, I'd say buy this game!
Good card game with a decent business model which may or may not be for you.

If you're on the fence about the price of constructed, then wait a bit to see how the market looks after it settles down.  For me, I'd rather spend a small amount of money for the cards I want than spend a large amount of time for a loot box.

And if you want to draft, you can already do that at no additional cost with casual draft and community tournaments.
the game itself is very good and fun, but i cant recommend it due to the valve "giff me [strike] mana [/strike] money" attitude.
Its similar to the Dota2 "no we wont improve matchmaking in order to make the game better - instead we add new features like dotaplus requiring you to continously and infinitely  "giff me [strike] mana [/strike] money"

Edit: Iknow its only becouse the huge player drop, but since valve started to listen to the community, i feel like i need to change my recommendation to +
Very fun game!
Coming from hearthstone and Magic, I really like that :
- we get the mana consistency of hearthstone.
- more decisions every turn, you have to think ahead all the time and plan.
- the battle for initiative and the fact you play one card and then pass initiative.
-Very good draft mode. I just wish their were more playable cards in the set.
-A lot of completly free modes (draft, tournaments...)
-constructed is the only mode that costs money and still haven't played it yet because I'm grinding my collection. Draft seems much better anyway (because of balancing issues)

On the negative side :
-game is not that expensive for me because I have a high winrate. I still don't have used all my initial tickets... But other players paid for me to go infinite and that is not a sustainable System.
-lack of balance close to what hearthstone knew at the beginning. Valve needs to nerf axe, drow... I never used half of the cards in the set that are really too bad on the other side.

I love this game that will improve with time.
Very good mechanics. Monetization is a problem for people that play constructed, if you go draft you can easily play only for the 20$ entry fee. Since Draft is very competitive and dynamic you will barely miss anything.
Worth the $20 just to play the free draft mode( Best Game Mode). The market also makes buying a deck less RNG than buying packs. Those complaining about the monetization have clearly never played an online card game before.
Great card game, so much depth. The monetisation suits me down to the ground actually spending far less money than hearthstone or magic to get competitive decks. It won’t suit you if your f2p tho simple
Unique and complex game where most of the strategy is about mindgames and outplaying your opponent, and less about creating the best card combos. Games last about 20-30 minutes- I end almost every game at the edge of my seat, there are a lot of close games that come down to 1 wrong decision.

$20 game price gets you unlimited free draft, which is a really interesting mode because of the hero and color system.

To play constructed you will have to buy cards, which you can buy individually through the marketplace instead of wasting money on packs. There is no way to grind free packs (unless you count maintaining a positive winrate in the paid-entry game modes)
As a 4 years Hearthstone player, I would say the negative complains on the monetization modal of this game are poorly argued. 

To play competitively in Hearthstone I have spent more than 100$ in the game and my card collection is far from being complete. But in this game, at least at currant stage, most of the cards can be purchased with less than 1 buck and can be sold later on when they are not needed. To get a rare card in Hearthstone instead, I have to grind for f***ing hours to complete my quests or pay high prices to open card packs and collect small amount of dusts.  

If you are a causal player who want to drop in and drop out whenever you want without costing money, then this game is probably not for you. But if you want a fresh and serious TCG experience, then disregard the unreasonable complains and just buy it.
Love this game, played at launch.  While it is challenging at first, it is very rewarding once you learn the ends and outs of it.  To those who say it's expensive.  I've spent about $60 in total on the game (same price you'd spend on any game these days).  With that $60 I got what comes with the game 10 packs + 2 starter decks + 5 event tickets.  I was able to build two budget friendly competitive decks from buying singles in the market place.  With those decks I've gone 4-2 both times in competitive constructed league netting me my event tickets back + 2 more packs.  I also bought a full playset of every common/uncommon card in the game.  So now all I have to do to fill the collection is get the rares.  No CCG can you get so much for that price.  Please look past all the 'free' hand outs that F2P games get and really do the math.  In the long run this game will be far cheaper than a traditiona F2P CCG based game.
I love this game. Ignore all of the salty manchildren who blindly defend inferior games through uninformed reasoning, misleading information, and blatant lies. This game has great visuals, has great gameplay where the better player wins, and actually costs less to play then other trading card games thanks to the steam market. This game is absolutely worth any amount of money you chose to spend on it, and appeals to an audience that wants to be challenged and taken seriously.
Original Comment: Meh.

Update: 

I'm enjoying the game more now, granted there's serious card balancing issues which I won't get into, that being said the new tourny system is great and the last update has been an improvement.
Initially I was against the absence of in-game card drops (aside from wins in expert play), but after a few hours, I'm not as worried with how Artifacts card economy. After a few matches, the complexity of Artifact dispells concerns that having the best cards will win you games. Sure, you could drop money on getting Axe and other high priced cards, or try your luck by opening card packs, but they aren't going to get you wins.  Matches are complex with every decision feeling important, which leaves you feeling satisfied even if you lose. This satisfaction stems from the lack of "cheese" cards (except Cheating Death) and that losses are the fault of your own, not your lack of high cost cards. Good decks at a casual level can be made from a few bucks, and if you want to commit more, sure it'll cost you, but the game is far from P2W.

TL;DR: Game is fun, fresh, and challenging. It will cost you more than the initial price to make a decent deck, but we are talking pennies to a few bucks. If you enjoy complex card games, Artifact is worth a try.
This game is a refreshing take on online card games and the gameplay is entirely unique, but people seem to be dissapointed. Most of the people that are complaining are talking about how the game has a $20 price tag and still includes $2 packs that are entirely optional to purchase if you want to play competitively. Those people should realize the game comes with 10 packs valued at $20 total and it comes with 5 event tickets. There is even a mode called phantom draft that lets you use any cards in the game to play with casually against another player.
Made my first deck with the ten starter packs and spent 50 cents to buy ten more cards. Proceeded to win 4-1 in my first gauntlet. Why is everyone angry :(
Good game, fun with friends, fun alone. You can decide to play it casually or seriously, you have the freedom to choose and that's why i think this game is great.
So far in 9 hours, I have had the most fun out of any card game launch I have ever had. Monetization is a big issue for a lot of people. Let me tell you for the $20 you pay just for the base game is easily 100s of hours of fun, from the casual play available in the game. I am about $70 in and built the most expensive "meta" deck currently and let me tell you, you can still lose if you don't play right, and the right play isn't always 100% clear due to the nature of the 3 lanes and counter play some less thought of cards have in situations. This game is amazing and can't wait to tell all my MTG buddies back home about it over XMAS holiday. 

The happens to be the cheapest card game I've played too, right now the full set is roughly $200-230 to complete out after playing your drafts. Hearthstone cost way more to play competitive constructed and magic is well even more so in physical form.
Definitely better than Heartstone. No grind, and you don't even need to collect cards because of the phantom draft mode.
Event tickets suck though but I don't play those modes.
A refreshing blend of CCGs and MOBAs. It looks gorgeous and it's a ton of fun to play. Valve has also shown they are listening to player feedback. Within only a few weeks of being released, they've already added an in-game progression system with ways to earn packs and event tickets for free in-game simply by leveling up. You can also buy cards that you want directly from the marketplace and prices are generally pretty low. In reality, this is probably one of the cheapest CCGs to play and it doesn't require you to grind hundreds of hours to get the cards you want.
This is the first card game that I feel is fair and enjoyable.
I like how there's 3 decks and how the card system works.

Would be nice if there was a chat option, the people that dont want it could then chose to just disable that feature.



Many will overlook this game due to there being no way to earn new cards without paying for them. The truth however is, as the games stands today actually has the best monetization model of digital card games today. 

Even if you dont want to spend any money on packs there are plenty of ways to play the cards for free. There are pre-constructed packs that include cards you dont own. Additonally, the free draft mode allows you to draft from all cards in the set. 

If you want to build your own deck you can purchase new card packs with real money. However after playing the game a bit and getting familiar with the cards via the other modes you might know which cards you need for the deck you have in mind. Rare heroes like Axe and Drow are about 15 bucks a piece but most other cards are all under 50 cents. This is a much better model and cost way cheaper than others such as hearthstone or MTG arena. In order to get the card you want with those games you still need to burn duplicate cards from your collection. In order to get more cards to burn or packs you need to spend time grinding to get enough duplicates or wild cards to get what you want. Artifact doesn't require you to grind anything. Grinding out cards like this is not fun. 

In addtion, this model has an economy in which even if you decide to spend money, there are ways to make some of that money back. Other games don't have that option. If you factor in that only the rarest of cards are costly (no more that 20 bucks) you can get what you want for less that what you would need to spend in packs. In the long run this works out to be the cheapest digital TCG out there. 

And aside from the economy of Artifact the game is actually very well done. From the graphics, sounds, lore, voice acting, everything is certainly top tier. Once you get into it and strategies start forming in you mind it becomes very fun. The concepts are new and is the first TCG that i played that didnt make me just want to play MTG. 

Its a great game and if you like the TCG genre or Dota, you should check it out.
Really angry !!!
I'm a PES fan from 2008 and i play PES about 10 years until now, quite a big fan right ? 
But from now i really dissapointed about how Konami plan/delvelop the game, specially about the offline part - master league. 
I play all Fifa and PES too, in the pass, i prefer PES but from this year, i really think that, the staffs of konami is just all the programers never play football in really life. I never write a review before event some games are really bad. But this kind of PES is unceptable, i never play it any more and will play fifa 19 instead, and in the next few years too, especially with the money you spend to buy the game, this game is really unacceptable. I play on PC and on PS4. If you buy this game to play with your friends, everything ís just fine, but if you want to play online, or play the offline mode ( master league or BAL), its really suck. The way Konami planed the game, they decided the script of the league.
Can you believe that ? i played 10 times against 1 small club from the Greek. But they acted like they all over 90. they faster than Rashford and Martial, stronger than event Pogba and Matic, event Varane, ... all of them, run like jet and bodyblock, interception all the game like buffaloes. 
when the ball comes up, pops out, i mean the orbit of ball is not idea. I - as a human, always need some seconds to guest or react, but they do not. They react with a bad, complex orbit ball event not slow the speed down. Can you imagine that ? just run straight ahead, and shoot, and goal, all the shoot is uncatchable - event with De Gea. And what about me ? Yeah, im a pes-er for 10 years, of course, i made some chance to shoot, but Lukaku, and sanchez, and dybala, ... all of them shoot straight to the keeper, you think that i dont know to to turn the ball to the corner of the goal ? 
and this is the best part, i play 10 times, and all of them, the opponent - small club from Greek, always win with 2 goals separate. If i made it 1-0, they will win 3-1, if i can have 2 goals, the score sheet is 4-2 
can you believe that ? 
I just want to play some normal game and have some fun after work. But i dont want a predefined script like this, with all of my effort is useless. 
If you are someone just like me, want to play offline mode, want to be a manager. i suggest you try FIFA19 and forget PES. 
Thank the konami for all the memories that i played with my friends, some 2 vs 2 games - really fun. But for now, cant be your fan anymore. I play you too long and understand that, that is your style. You want player go through the game as what you want. But i want a game that i can play freely and the result is just something that i can decide, or atleast, it's reasonable with the real life and the rule of phisic too.
Dont buy it or you will get really angry like me now !!!
Great game if you think of it as a board game and not a collectable card game.  The amount of content you get for only $20 is a steal compared to your standard board game.  If you're more interested in collecting cards and netdecking you might wanna stick with the classic options like MTG, Hearthstone etc
If you are into card games at all I recommend buying it. It is one of the best designed digital strategy games currently on the market. There looks like there is a lot of RNG but it is easy to overcome it and it adds a lot of depth to the game. I've had maybe 1-3 matches where RNG decided the outcome and there was nothing else I could have done.

The $20 dollar price tag gets you unlimited phantom drafts and entry into the constructed event where you get to choose one of six decks to play. You also get the 10 packs and 5 tickets. The market makes card prices somewhat reasonable, but getting any card requires money. If you are looking to play cheap stick with phantom draft or find a pauper(play with only commons/uncommons) community on Reddit/Discord.

My one critique is that the game lacks social elements and some sort of competitive ladder/ranking system. The devs have stated that ranks are their highest priority and should hopefully be patched soon.

Overall, if you want a more strategic TCG pick this game up. The $20 entry fee for unlimited phantom drafts is good enough alone. Just know that you might need a bit of patience for some of the other features to get added. If you are still cautious, I recommend following the game and keeping up with it for the next few months to see how things develop.
This is a great game and not nearly as p2p as some people make it out to be. Valve has been very responsive to community demands so far to make the game more accesible to f2p players.
One day this will be the best card game for sure! Only con is you need to spend money in here to collect cards. But when this compared to other card games Artifact is far more better!
Most of the complainers came into the game with an electronic F2P model idea and don't understand physical card games at all it seems. I really enjoy the game, it has enough randomness that its not just a faceroll for people that master the game, but still somewhat steady where you aren't relying on RNG and more on realistic odds and probability.
If you have more money at your disposal than a 15 year old child. Say, the $60 most people pay for a AAA game these days, then I would highly recommend artifact. The monetization method is fair, and the gameplay is absolutely outstanding. As a years-long CCG player, I would say that this is the best, most complex, game out there right now. If you feel like you are losing games due to luck, then you are doing something wrong.
The Hearthstone Killer. Everything you like about HS, but for adults instead of baby's first CCG. Open market, dirt cheap to get a complete set of cards, plenty of free play modes once you get in the gate. And fun as hell. Challenging. Can't wait for more cards in future expansions. RNG in some cases is heartbreaking, would really pray that they do less of the 50% chance bullshit, but that's my biggest complaint. The RNG that's embedded in the card attack direction choices isn't as game-breaking or frustrating as I expected (I say this as a fan of Euro board games which have NO RNG). It has fucked me over only rarely and can mostly be played around, with plenty of options to mitigate the RNG.
The monetization model is not an issue, everyone who thinks they should be able to "grind" the whole content for free forgot where online TCGs originate from... 

The game mechanics are thought out very well and, while being easy to understand, have a lot of depth to them. The tutorial covers most of the points, iirc it is only missing a proper explanation of initiative. 

I personally don't mind that the game has no visible progression, but that is one of the few deficits this game has. 

If you enjoy cardgames and don't mind the progression thingy, you might like Artifact as well.
This game is a Masterclass in TCG's! It accomplishes all the development goals and the game flow is simple yet intuitive. This is also the best monetization system of any TCG. If you want a card game with a skill-emphasis that you can play on a budget (I believe a whole collection costs less than a MTG or Yugioh deck) this is for what you've been waiting for. If you want a ftp CCG experience this may not be your game as you cannot reliably earn cards without some investment first.
New child from Valve and Magic creator Richard Garfield is not easy to review. Its core is one of the most innovative card games I've played in years and definitely the best purely digital one. It is focused on hardcore audience and demands an investment from its players - be it time to properly learn the game or just simply money. I will not describe how the game works, there are plenty of better people for that. 

[h1]GAME[/h1]
Upon release the game lacked several "core" features, such as profiles, some progression system (even though I personally do not really need it) and even the balance of the cards was off.  Valve just released a new patch with card balance (biggest change in my book) and some progression system. Should that be there upon release? Yes, definitely but Valve reacts quickly and is making the game better really fast.

And boy, does the game feel right! Matches are longer than the competititors but every single match is just so tense, you are on the edge of your seat and hope you just outsmarted your opponent and will be able to destroy his tower. 
It just feels so different to finally play a card game when deck building is not 80% of the skill and you actually need to make so many decisions to come up victorious. 

[i]Should I just kill this hero now? Or wait one more turn, so he doesn't have him during his most crucial turn.

Where should I deploy my heroes? What color of spells will I need in what lane? 

Should I actually kill my hero now so I can get him back just in time for hist big combo? 
[/i]

There is so much going on! You need to actually think! It's great! The RNG plays its role a lot in matches, but you generally can plan around it and work with it. But sometimes, it just screws you, like in any card game. 

[h1]ECONOMY[/h1]
The game is not F2P. You pay for card packs (well, you get some more with the new progression system), you pay for an opportunity to get more card pack and you can buy the single cards for real money.

And I'm one of the weird people who actually likes it more this way. I seriously hate F2P card games - they always put so many hooks and "incentives" to get you to play the game even when you don't want to. I don't want to play today? OOPS you just lost your opportunity to finish you dailies, you're getting behind! You want this card? Better disenchant 4 other cards or just, you know, BUY milion other packs and hope! I hate grind, I don't want to play a game to finish some quest, so I can get coins to buy pack to MAYBE get the card I want. I am a grown up, I'd rather pay some money for it thank you. Needless to say that the normal cards in Artifact are so cheap that I don't even care.

I'm not saying this TCG system is the best I could imagine but hell, I'll always take it over F2P grindfest, which actuallly ends up even more expensive than Artifact.

[h1]CONCLUSION[/h1]
If you like hardcore card games then Artifact is a must to at least try. It plays differently, it's tense, smart and you would seriously feel good about beating your opponents. It has many flaws but I have a firm believe that Valve will make the game better over time. 

Highly recommended.
Say what you will about the microtransactions. Say what you will about the price point to entry.

Artifact is a very interesting and enjoyable card game. There's a lot of deep thinking involved in the very simple act of balancing your heroes across lanes; in choosing when to play certain cards; in trying to overcome the odds of someone just playing with better heroes.

And with the latest 1.2 patch? Valve is clearly listening to the complaints of the unbalanced RNG and the concept of progression. There's a lot of fun to be had if you're not looking to spend your hard earned money beyond the initial price of the game.
Was a fan of the game before the recent patch, but with the last two patches the game has vastly improved in responce to critisms, I look forward to seeing how the game continues to evolve.
Very fun mechanics and recent updates have made the game much better than at launch. With ways to get free packs and tickets now you aren't required to spend money on the game besides the initial investment to have a great time.
There are so many close games and decisions which makes the games too intense to play. The balance changes of the cards  is keeping the game fresh and interesting to watch. There are lots of community tournament in there which is awesome. Highly recommend it.
The core gameplay is very good and it definitely has more potential than hearthstone's or magic's core gameplay when those games were initially launched with their base set. The draft mode is incredibly fun and very skill testing. I have high hopes for the game when the next couple expansion sets hit and how the gameplay improves. Some of the key issues involving progression, ranking, and game balancing were addressed very nicely in the most recent update. 

While you can now earn a limited amount of cards for free each season from the recent update, I must fully warn you that you will most likely need to spend some amount of money on this game in the long run. Unlike the other f2p card games out there, Artifact does not hide the fact that you need to spend money to play this game and I think a lot of people were put off by that. What I think people fail to metion is that with the other f2p games you will likely spend money as well, because I know I have. You just might not feel too bad about it when you do spend the money. It really is a matter of perception and psychology. I do however think that Artifact will be the "cheapest" game out of those if you DO SPEND MONEY to get cards. 

Overall, the core gameplay is very good and well worth your time if you like card games and strategy games. The gameplay is incredibly deep and every game plays differently. Draft mode is very fun and constructed will get more variety with new sets. The two patches in the past two weeks have alleviated a lot of concerns that the community had with the game and has shown that Valve really wants to improve the game for the long run.
Recent updates are slowly turning this ship around! Don't let the up-front cost put you off; if you are into strategic card games, Artifact can easily go tow-to-toe with other classics like MTG and Netrunner.
Great game, if you ever played MtG you will most likely like this and feel at home quickly.
It isn't yet as deep as MtG but due to the 3 lane format and only the first edition having been released, this might change in future. Since so many bad reviews exclusively dislike the paymet model, but even professional reviews don't explain it properly, let me put some things straight: You don't need to buy any more than the initial 10 boosters that come with the game or buy individual cards to play 80% of the modes. You can play even the most expensive and rare cards for free either as part of a preconstructed deck, or by playing a phantom draft in which you get 5 temporary boosters from which you can pick cards to construct a deck (you don't keep these cards though, you can play up to 5 times with them or untill you lose 2 matches-you cn do a new draft every 30 minutes). After lerning the game in free draft mode, you can start using the 5 tickets that also come with the game to win more boosters. 
You only need to buy cards if you want to play with individually constructed permanent decks.
And if you just play casual constructed, you can often construct a powerfull deck for less than 1€.
In competitive constructed you will need the best cards though and in some cases even multiple copies of them, so this can get expensive. Actually my initial 10 boosters contained cards worth more than the game costed, but it was luck; i decided to sell 3 cards to buy another 10 boosters which didn't really contain any high value cards at all xD
Watch some youtube gameplays to make sure you wanna give it a try, you won't regret it. Great game and way better than all the other card games out there, which are either very bad (Hearthstone, Yugi-oh...) or very expensive (MTG).

IF YOU NEVER PLAYED A CARD GAME BEFORE, READ THIS:
PROS
- You get your money's worth in packs, so it's "FREE".
- This is the only card game I've known where you can play infinite draft for FREE.
- Forget about playing any card game without spending money (or a LOT of time to get free stuff instead). Even Hearthstone you can't get all the cards easily.
- Most of the cards are VERY CHEAP, check out other card games and you'll be surprised on how cheap Artifact is.
- You can play several modes without having ANY cards.
- You can play with pre-built decks for free with expensive cards on them and get to know different ideas IF you want to build something for yourself.
- Valve is trying really hard to make it work, making a lot of good changes. You can even sell back cards that got nerfed so you don't lose money.

CONS
- Not many cards yet, but the game is still young so...
- Part of the community is new to card games, so they give up and tend to give bad reviews without even giving a try to it, but eventually the game will form a strong community (I think/hope).

I have played Magic: The Gathering (MTG) for over a decade and tried some other card games. Because of the MTG's complexity I never thought I'd find another card game I could enjoy, but as it turns out Artifact is really nice and I'm excited to see where it'll get. I stopped playing MTG because it became unaffordable, 3K dollars to compete with ONE deck is a lot of money, although I still love the game.
People can buy this game, not put anymore money into it and still have a lot of fun with it even if they didnt unpack Axe.
You can set up draft tournaments with your friends and have access (potentially) to all the rare cards
You can also set custom rules so the tourney is commons only, sort of a pauper league
Issues with unbalanced decks will disappear as more sets come out (sooner than we all think)
Despite the bad rep at launch, Valve is actively fixing the issues; for example progression with reward tickets/packs and nerf/buffing cards were implemented within 2 weeks! This is very refreshing compared to what at least one popular competitor does where the game has broken cards at least until next expansion comes ~6 months later. 

Pay2play aspect of this game is greatly exaggerated. Pay2play only applies to prize modes where you can win packs. These modes are rouhgly 1/3rd of the available modes. Even in prize modes If you  manage to get a positive win rate, you can win your tickets back, win packs and recycle or sell extra cards from won packs to get more tickets => your collection will grow and you dont have to put any money in. It's important to note that you can actually achieve a high win rate in Artifact due to a high skill ceiling and limited rng!

The games themselves are very intense! 3 lane mechanic gives the players so many options; where to deploy your 5 heroes of different colors (hero of a certain color allows you to play the cards of that color in that lane). Crosslane play, building up your heroes with modifiers and items, overwhelming your opponent with minions or lane improvements... there are so many strategies you can come up during a game on how to win, and the strategy can change during the game. This is especially highlighted in the draft modes (where the decks are build from a selection of random cards). Winning or losing can often be tracked to some key decisions made during a match which is very rewarding for the player.

Recommended!
great game 
alot of people saying pay to win, but there are game modes that dont require you to have cards and still have as good as chance as other player to win im personally enjoying draft mode the most as every deck is diffrent instead of the same kinda constructed decks

free draft modes - gauntlet mode pre built deck mode

only thing i would like to see in the game is a way to communicated with the other players as ive had a few good games and just wanted to say good game to them or add them as a friend to future games if thats via a chat box or even emotes/chat phrases
After unpacking 10 packs, You can sell all cards to get money.
If you are lucky you can get free Artifact base game.
You can get 10$ at worst. Why not?
UI and design are very good.  There is a lot of depth to the game, but I'd like there to be more cards and for all the heroes to be strong instead of a few.
It's a good time. It's really tough to get started, and there's no progression at all in the game. You have to spend money for cards, no way around it.

The gameplay itself is amazing. Even if you're playing a mirror match, there's enough thought that goes into all the things you have to do. It's not like Magic or Hearthstone, you've got real choices to make, and the randomness that is present throughout is very manageable. 

Would love a way to get new cards without spending money, and would definitely need some sort of progression for long-term play, but I strongly recommend it if you're into cerebral games, especially if you like your own actions having a larger impact that the cards themselves.

Looking forward to the game growing in features overtime.
A great game that I've super been enjoying and I expect I will continue to do so, some great design and fun gameplay, wonderful free drafts and cheap buy in to prize structure, as a long time card game player the pricing is very reasonable.
Complex card game really well designed. Games are longer then other card games but that means more decisisons and more meaningful wins. I plan on playing this for years to come. 


If you play other real world trading card games then this game is great (apart from the fact you cant trade cards with friends).
If you don't play real world card games and want to see what its like then this game could be for you since its monetization is the same (but you cant trade cards)
If you dont play real world card games and dont want to see what its like then i doubt this game will appeal to you.

But for real tho, this game should have been free to play against bots with test decks and then to play your frineds you buy packs/cards.
Highly recommended. This is a really addicting game. Has a bit of a learning curve but Its not as complicated as people say once you play a few games. As of patch 1.2 the design team has adopted a new balance philosophy so cards are now getting nerfed and buffed. Buying a whole collection or a netdeck is massively cheaper than other digital card games. Phantom drafts are completely free to play if you arent intereted in dropping cash past the initial buy price.
Recent updated fixed the majority of the problems with the game, namely the design philosophy. Valve stated that they were wrong and changed it. Valve is a good developer and I have high hopes for the future of Artifact.

Draft is a premier mode in other card games and in Artifact it's completely free. While the base set has gotten a little stale to me already, card games usually improve as new expansions are released (until they start releasing too many...)

It's a good game.
While the economy is certainly an issue, I can honestly say that the gameplay itself is fun and rewarding. It feels a lot more tactical than many other card games, where a stale meta and "optimal decks" are par for the course. The games are fairly quick, fun, and there's a lot of counter play and strategy involved.

Make no mistake, the economy is currently a bad thing, but most people are hyper-focusing on that and not really interested in reviewing the game for anything else.

Edit: 22nd December - The economy has now been fixed, and some cards were balanced - a vast improvement.
I come from a table top, game background, and I think this game is great, and a great value. Playing Artifact not badly can take a dozen games or so, but once you get the hang of it, it's a really fun experience.  Your $20 entry price gets you 100 cards, which with the basic decks, will get you started with some base line decks.

The game then offers bot matches, a few pre constructed decks to learn the game, challenge mode / decks, casual constructed, and casual phantom draft. For me I've already spent many hours playing, and I guess I don't know what more one would want from a $20 spend. I will personally be playing at least a few more months as there's a lot to explore. This game has managed to hook me in a way the Hearthstone just didn't do for me. 

I'm guessing if you come from a Hearthstone or MTG: Arena background, the monitization expectations are different, but for me this was a lot of value and game for the money. Not to mention valve seems to be pretty responsive, and they've already been updating the client (which is a great sign). In all honesty, I will be surprised if this game lasts longer than a year or so before getting the Paragon treatment (RIP) but for the time being it's a reasonably priced fun experience that, depending on how you approach it, cand give you many hours of play for you $20.
This game gets a lot of hate from some people but I do not understand why. 20 hours in and I am still in love this game is amazing. The pricing is a very debated topic but if you don't want to spend more money on the game you don't have to as you can play draft for free as much as you want as well as the other free game modes. And I think the pricing is great as I can buy the exact deck I want for like $10 rather than being forced to buy a ton of packs and hope I pull the cards I want. Great game, great pricing model. Try it out.
It's a fun game with engaging depth and challenging gameplay that feels very rewarding. The current preconstructed deck gauntlet mode gives engaging and skillfull decks to play with for free, and drafting is interesting and done right, allowing for getting a better understanding of what does and doesn't work. It's very satisfying to draft a deck that leads you to a perfect run in the gauntlet, and even with standard and cheap cards, doing the same in the constructed gauntlet.

Expert gauntlet modes increase the stakes and give pack rewards for close to perfect runs, letting you add to your collection from how good of a player you've become. The fact that expert gauntlet draft is an option means you can have fun and expand your deck options just from playing the game competetively. 

Community market prices for building engaging or powerful decks aren't too costly, and will only get cheaper over time. I've dealt with games against opponents with beefy rare and powerful decks that have wiped my board turn 1, and nothing has been more satisfying than clawing my way back to a victory with the handful of commons and uncommons I have. 

The game might not be for you though, which is okay. Some people may feel like the game is P2W, but having fun in draft modes completely avoids that complaint, which personally, hasn't been felt at all, given that bread and butter cards are worth pennies on the marketplace and that player skill can pull through if you strategize right. Other complaints might relate to the game being RNG heavy, but all the RNG can be played around and accounted for in your strategy, something that I feel adds to the depth of the gameplay and gives the player more opportunities to plan, execute, and be rewarded by.

As of buying and playing the game from launch, it has been a phenomenal time, an experience that I value more than the $20 asking price. I am excited to keep playing the game, experience the growing community, and see what direction the future holds content-wise for Artifact.
I love this game so much! The amount of depth and strategy the game has to offer is incredible. There are so many decisions to make and i feel like im always learning what i could do better. I will say this is not a casual game. This is for people who are competitive in nature and love to learn. As of right now I have no complaints about the game.
Amazing card game, the best I have played and I have played tons of them.

The matches are always so close and tense. Complexity of Artifact is quite high, it's not a casual game, that's what makes the game great.

Pricing might be steep for those unfamiliar with card games. Compared to other card games, the pricing is very generous.

You can buy booster packs or buy/sell single cards in the steam market. It's quite convenient, you can select the cards from the in-game collection view.

After paying the initial game cost, you don't need to pay any more if you don't want to. Theres enough free content to be interesting. There's event mode, where you play with preconstructed decks. And there is casual phantom draft, where you draft your deck for free and play until 5 wins or 2 losses. 

Among the game modes where you have to pay is keeper draft. You have to pay 2 tickets and 5 packs, but you keep the cards you draft. It's a great pack-opening minigame of sorts. If you want, you can pick only rare cards that appear. Your deck quality might suffer, but you keep the cards later. There are extra rewards if you win 3 or more times.
I just got this game on 11/30/18 and I love it!
there is a ptw part of the game and I must say I caved in and spent 10 or so dollars but the game is still fun and worth the money.
(a few more things)
this game is just like MTG (I love MTG) and its kinda better because you don't have to find someone who also plays it irl and you dont spend $4 on a pack. you only have to spend around $2 on a pack which is great.
If you wan't to get this game or are thinking about it I would deffinetly recommend this game. especially to all the MTG, hearthstone, and other card game players.
some people hate it just because they wanted hl3 which I can't complain the hl seires is my favorite but I still enjoy this game.

thanks

8/10
At first I was very sceptical with all that P2W drama and that I would feel pressure to play just to not loose money, but after playing game for some time I figured out that it is pretty easy to have ticket back after draft game.

Draft games are very fun. Action goes back and forth and I always finding myself barely catching victories with great room for outplay.
 This is the best card game by far. Things that I expect from the game:
1) Quick expansion releases. Because starting pool of cards is pretty small
2) Rank system, so it would be even more competetive. Especially would be fun to have ranked draft.

Best online card game in the market right now and it helps that Valve has been super responsive to feedback, going so far as to change entire game philosophies in order to appease its fanbasse. In a way that doesn't feel like they're rolling over but actually listening.

The game itself is more of a board game you bring your decks to than it is a card game, which is why it's easy to stay engaged each game no matter how many times you've grinded it. 

Highly recommend for any card game fans. And if you just like the idea of operating a moba from a birds eye view, this is a pretty sick representation.
Excellent, deep and complex gameplay but was initially plagued with greedy monetization system. The lastest patch however fixes most of the monetization problems and promises to keep the cards balanced through buffs and nerfs. You can play the draft mode for free after buying the game its fair for all. If you are looking for a dota alternative becasue of time constrains then this might be a good choice.While it doesn't give me the amount of satisfaction that winning a close game of dota does, it is much less emotionally demanding.
As long a long time Hearthstone player, I feel like Artifact is what was missing from my experience with HS. Where I felt compelled to understand the meta, the intricate odds of every play in HS, Artifact feels like a REAL strategy game. Almost every game, I can honestly reflect on why I won or lost based on the decisions I made, not weird RNG moments that were out of my control. My only wish is that this game was also on mobile devices.
I couldn't give Artifact a good review despite liking the game due to some philosophy decisions by Valve. These changes (card balancing mostly) have all been addressed by Valve and now I can say Artifact is worth the investment.
Good job Valve! :) Just keep listening to your players and this can become a great game! :) 

There is progression in the game now!

You nerf op cards and buff weak!

I'm in for the long run :)
Valve has listened to almost every single complaint put forth by the community, surprisingly in a timely manner. The game is well rounded after the recent progression update, definitely recommended.
Awesome game... it's $19.99 but you get well over $20 in value in "free" loot when you open the game for the first time. They just released a new patch and things are looking really promising as of 12/20/18.
most fun card game i have ever played if you get past the pay model witch i don't think is that bad but i understand why people are mad also voice acting is top tier great art to
The gameplay mechanics is very fun once you get the hang of it. Many people complain about the cost for each card but the prices are relatively low and range from a few cents to a few dollars. Sure they add up but I am looking at this game as a full fledged $60 game. That’s what it’s worth to me; although I spent $20 to buy the base game, I feel the worth is about $60 so I will spend about $40 on cards. No complaints about the cost here. I’ll update my review once I play this further.
When the game first came out I was worried it would struggle to keep players playing. Those worries have thankfully been put to rest after the recent progression update, I am now confident in recommending this game to anybody who's a fan of card or strategy games.
My comprehensive artifact review, as someone who has lived and breathed this game everyday for the weeks since release:

1) GAMEPLAY: Now, the gameplay is absolutely phenomenal, like the most complex board game ever created. It features intricacy and great depth, allowing it to be quite a skill test when determining the winner of any match. RNG exists, but your capability to adapt on the fly is the real skill in the game. Also, there are ways to play around the RNG if you so desire, eg, playing cards like Ventriloquy or Pick a Fight if arrow RNG is bogging you down. Sometimes RNG does decide the winner of a game, but more often than not, one can always trace back the decisions that allowed the game to be decided on coinflip and consider the other outs one would have had. 
I'll admit that the card set at launch could be a little less like other card games and more to capitalise on the fresh mechanics that Artifact brings to the table, but it is only the base set of cards and I'm certain as we move on to new expansions, this issue will remedy itself.
Balance is great, heroes have their own niches and are tech choices in themselves - eg if we want to capitalise on a certain niche in our red black deck, we could run Sorla for running at towers, Tinker for Midrange aoe or Lich for a more control oriented deck. Some heroes feel a bit weak and unplayable due to their poor stats or sigs, but it's really only very few and most heroes are constructed playable. maybe with the new patch, blue seems a bit strong? but let's see when the meta settles. 

2) BALANCING: Valve has done something historic with their last update, freely buffing and nerfing cards despite their original "market-driven economy and thus no balancing" policy. This sets an incredible precedent for balancing to come, and they did address all of the problem areas in balancing. Hats off to Valve. 
Some rares do feel like they're in the card pool just to make other rares feel rarer - I know Garfield said that rarity =/= power but honestly finding rares in packs is so polarising. It's either OH WOW KANNA or goddamn im getting 3 cents off the market for this Watchtower. I do have some suggestions to even the playing field a little, but this isn't the forum for that.
Sometimes constructed does feel a bit p2w if you're severely lacking in collection, but homebrew groups like the Artifact pauper or peasant communities hold regular scrims and tournaments and it truly does emulate the cardshop experience. I was lucky to unbundle a Kanna and some annihilations and AACs, so I had a viable mono blue deck from the get go - beating decks that cost several times more quite frequently.

3) FLAVOUR: If you're a lorehead like me, this game will absolutely blow you away. All the cards interact with one another in a dynamic way, really lending to the immersive feel that every game is it's own little universe. A fun one I love hearing is the Red Mist guys played on Legion Commander's side of the board say, "These are truly strange times, commander.". The heroes react to occurences on the game board just like in dota, talking about their allies, enemies, items equipped, cards played and so on. 
The game board feels rich and colourful, the imps add a lot to the ambience as well. They have the cutest reactions and I love how they're trying to talk to the player - hey the opponents board is empty hit the ancient, or, oh no we're being lethaled this turn. It certainly makes the game feel a lot less dry and math-y much like a lot of people have complained about. 
Every single card has it's own little blurb of story, reminds me a lot of the flavour text on old magic and DM cards that helped me immerse myself in their universe. The voice acting is phenomenal and it adds a layer of EU to the (not-so-great) dota lore that I've followed for a decade. 

4) PROGRESSION: Well they just done added it. Seems like all I've been asking for since the beginning - a couple of tickets and packs every once in a while to keep me, a pretty much f2p player, hooked. I feel like the system that they have implemented is great, it reminds me of the progression in old gwent (a game i loved muchly, not so much new gwent). They have all these achievements that give u a liiittle bit more xp at the end of the game that are actually quite validating, like winning with 1 tower hp or buffing a hero to 30hp, gives u a bit of additional workaround if you're into that kind of thing. 
Going 2-2 in any expert format still feels terrible, maybe implementing one casual consolation prize would go a long way with the casual playerbase.

5) UI AND WHATNOT: Everything in the game feels fluid and organic, be it the collection manager, recycling cards, drafting for gauntlet, the emoting, the keybinds. It feels like a perfectly polished client that seems smooth and cosy to navigate. (I know there's a lot of hullabaloo about missing features and we still beta, but this is a personal opinion). Shoutout to the new emotes system, I've never had more fun BMing in any game before, they are absolutely great. The ability to react to things that you or your opponent does adds the social facet that the game was always missing.



This game is a full 5/5 stars. It is a game that I didn't know I wanted until I saw the first preview tournament - which led to a six month long hunger of trying to catch every little bit of content that came out. I don't think any game I've ever played meets my niche dream game requisities like Artifact does - If you like CCGs as well as dota, I wouldn't even hesitate to pick this game up. Don't let the low playerbase / reddit hate train discourage you, this game is a must-recommend for me and I've been singing its praises all year. 

pepeJAM I AM A DOGGIE pepeJAM
As a disclaimer, I haven't played much constructed, so this is more pertinent to draft than constructed. 

This is by far the best draft digital card game i've played. Sure there are some heroes that are better than others, but in draft, the odds of getting those heroes are very unlikely. In general you will have to work with the mediocre heroes and a lot of the times, the default heroes for each color. The game itself in draft mode goes fairly long (often mana turn 10-13), and usually games are very close. Often times games you lose is because of a mistake you've made, and this game has a very high skill ceiling (unlike hearthstone, where the optimal play is fairly easy to read). The frequency of nail-biter game in draft mode is so high that winning a game in phantom draft (casual and free) are often by itself gives you such a triumph feeling that cannot be obtained anywhere else. 

Monetization wise, I found that the game is pretty fair. If you've played magic or yugioh in real life, this is what it entails to. If you want to get into the game, you have to pay to play. Realistically, this game (even for constructed) is far cheaper than hearthstone unless you are willing to committ hundreds of hours each month.  Given that there is a trade market (which I really appreciate), you cannot get free packs, or the packs won't retain any value. This is as realistic as an actual TCG in terms of existence of a market. 

In terms of progression and reward, why do we need reward to play? If you don't derive enjoyment in playing the game itself, you shouldn't be playing this game. Playing for reward is how freemium games these days try to get you hooked, but it doesn't mean you actually have fun playing the game. 

On top of all, you have free draft mode to play. Hearthstone doesn't have that, what more can you ask for? People complaining about the lopsided constructed mode should really give draft mode a shot. 

Excellent rule set and mechanics.  The game definitely needs the introduction of more cards and a ranked ladder system, but the overall "bones" are fantastic.  If you are put off by the up front retail price you can always sell the majority of the base cards and what you get from packs to recoup your purchase.  Draft mode is the best mode and requires no owned cards and you can also experiment with ~8 preconstructed decks for free without owning any cards.
I bought this game on release, and enjoyed it even though it had some major flaws.  This most recent update along with the attitude of Valve has completely washed away any possible regret I might have had. They are taking the game in the right direction, and even though I enjoyed Artifact before, I'm enjoying it much more now.
So. Hey! I'm the first to review this game! (Probably, Who knows.)
Lets get some things out of the way.
The time zone where I live in which is GMT so this game came at like 9:30 PM and I don't want to do a all nighter on this.

The tutorial is pretty good! Having spent about £16 on this game I went having douts about the tutorial after playing TF2  tutorial which is dogshit, But Valve have nailed it on the head with this! Good Job!

Visuals are pretty good. My graphics expectancy is quite high and they are not hard on the eyes!

#Gunna edit this later
Random mechanics are always mostly bad, this game tries to keep things interesting by adding a lot of randomness. If you dont like random card effects and random chances and randomness in general, then this game is probably not for you. minion and heroe placement is random, who or what minions and heroes attack is random, and some cards have random effects. A LOT of randomness. this game has much potential but the randomness ruins it. the randomness takes a lot of strategy out of the game and forces you to play as you go. changes i think need to be made are: they have to allow you to choose minion/hero placement, and all minions/heroes should always attack foward except for when card effects are added or applied.
You can draft as much as you want for free. I don't mean going infinite, i mean there's a casual draft that lets you play as much as you want.

Then there's an expert draft that needs an entry ticket. I honestly, legitimately don't get the hate anymore. Not being able to free play in a paid game was stupid, it's no longer like that. 

Oh, the game itself ? Probably the most skill-intensive one i've ever played. it feels great, it's very rewarding. I've been through MTG, HS, Duelyst, and others, this one holds my interest very much.


If you like strategy games or card games you'll find something there.
To play constructed you need to invest more money into the game but if you want to play other free gamemodes you don't need more than the initial cost. Artifact is a really fun and different card game. There is still a lot of ways they can improve the game and I hope to see some updates from Valve in the near future.
This game is absolutely fantastic if you are willing to drop an extra $20+ you will enhance your experience , still doesnt take away phantom draft and the 10 packs that  u might get lucky with
Let me get one thing out of the way - don't buy the game if you are looking to build the best deck ever without spending any money. You get packs and tickets when you play the game, and as you level up. I'd say you get enough. If you feel the need to buy more cardpacks - you are free to do so. I spent around 40€ on steam to build my deck. Im freaking 19 years old, I have a normal job. 40€ is not much when you are planning on actually playing the game and doing fun combos etc. If you don't really have the money, then just don't buy the game. It's pretty obvious. Of course, the system should allow you to earn drops without spending any more of your precious money, but it doesn't. It gives you a good amout of cards to start with and when you rellay want to be competitive... you can go ahead and buy more cards. Your Cards will always have value. Let's say that you spend 100€ on cards (let's assume that you bought them from the marketplace). You can get your  money back if you sell your cards at the marketplace (at least 80-90% of it). You can then use that money to buy other games. But what about the children who want to get into Artifact? Well the game really isn't marketed towards younger audiences. As a kid, I was playing Dota 2 and CSGO. I earned money and used it to buy skins etc. if you are passionate about something, then it's not a waste of money. I made a real life best friend thanks to Dota 2. Monetization in Artifact is overblown. Statements as ''you need to spend around 400€ to get all of the cards'' might be true, but do you really need all of the cards? No! I feel like you get enough cards for free to compete. But if you want to be the best, you might have to spend a little money. Just like any other card collecting game. Unlike games like hearthstone you can sell your cards.
I like Dota's setting and lore but my reflexes aren't good enough to play it well. This game lets me enjoy the wonderful setting Valve created in a more accommodating genre.
This game got so many critism and argue about p2w but in this game most valuable card 8 $ btw game balanced as hell even if you play shitty, game was not crawl in ownage situation.
People just dont want to play complex and brain needed games anymore. Even a casual HS players think that game so hard to understand, but it is not and it is much more high pitch than other card games.
Maybe the problem is entry fee. Steam maybe reorganise the f2p and like HS you cannot do any shit without buying cards or playing hundred of hours.
Nice game.  Just hold your tickets with packs and learn some basics in free mode, when you will feel confident in free draft try yourself in keeper draft or phantom draft. This will help you to win lots of cards with starting tickets and packs.
[i]Please note that this review was last updated December, 6th, 2018[/i]

I hope to deliver a nuanced review for a good game with notable flaws on release. For refrence some of the games I'll be comparing Artifact to are Hearthstone, MTG, and Gwent. I'm mostly a constructed player; however, I have also played a lot of draft. I've put 55 hours into this game over the past few days, so I certainly enjoy it. I think compared to some of the aforementioned TCGs Artifact has a lot more potential and will probably keep me interested for far longer than any other online TCG. Though the core gameplay to me is more interesting than any other TCG the game has glaring flaws in both gameplay and basic feature.


[h1]Gameplay:[/h1]

Let's start with the flaws in the gameplay. Though I'm surprised at the ballance of the game in general that isn't to say it's perfect. Many heros and cards, while I wouldn't venture to say are op or p2w, are certainly so good I'd imagine you could take them in almost any situation. On the other hands there are many cards that are so niche even for a creative player(atleast I like to think so) like me that I'd say they might just be underpowered, this might change as more cards are released and we see new card synergies. For example, in 99% of scenarios the hero Keefe is just goign to simply be a worse Axe..... Then their are some heros like Venomancer  that though somewhat unique seems overall lackluster in impact. However, these complaints aren't to disparrage the game, in fact I can think of fun uses for almost every card, just wanted to point out that the game isn't perfect certainly. As far as constructed being pay to win, I do regularly beat what seem to be the "meta top decks" with more memey strats, nothing is so powerful that it is an auto win or even an advantage if the player is still bad, so there are no braindead instawin decks.


[h1]Pricing:[/h1]

This seems to be a highly contentious talking point of the game. First off I'd like to point out that if you only intend to play draft card prices don't affect you in the slightest, you can play casual drafts for free as much as you'd like. I'd like to say Artifact's payment system has the potential to be highly volatile, but I commend Steam for tryng something new. As of the current date of this review Artifact's payment system is probably hands down my favorite compared to ANY other card game. I personally always like playing and building a lot of fun memey decks in card games and the starting price of a meme deck depending on what you get out of packs is 5$ to 20$ dollars I'd say, each deck after that will probably cost significantly less as you acquire more of the expensive cards. That price is mostly affected by a few cards you'll almost certainly want to have but I could build a playable and fun deck for something ridiculous like a dollar. Now I'd say, at absolute worst, if you got incredibly unlucky with your starting packs and you wanted the "best" deck in the game I think your deck might go for around 50$ to 60$ dollars. To me this pricing seems reasonable for a card game, compared to Gwent and Hearthstone I feel every additional dollar I put in goes a lot further. Now of course it's hard to continue getting new cards in this game, though technically possible with the 5 starting tickets they give you in the expert game modes, as opposed to the aforementioned games which allow for complete f2p card acquisition. In Hearthstone atleast I often find myself simply frustrated playing against better decks that someone clearly just spent 100$ in packs on expansion release day to beat me with, so even though it's free to play, I personally find the f2p grueling an if you're a competitive player you'll probably end up putting hundreds of dollars in the game anyway, compared to artifact playing with my initial pack decks felt perfectly fun and pretty fair. I'd like to hear other people's input in the comments, let me know what you think of the pricing compared to cardgames you've played.


[h1]Final thoughts[/h1]

Lastly I do have one big gripe left for the game. I don't see a reason to not have a ranked system.... I really do hope they add a ranked constructed and draft. Yes their is expert play, but expert play serves an entirely different purpose from a ranked ladder. I think if they add a ranked ladder you'd see much higher player retention, but as far as I'm aware there are currently no intentions of adding a ranked system. One good thing they do intend to add is a mobile release, once this comes out on mobile I'll probably be completely done with Hearthstone thankfully.

tl;dr:
As of release this is an excellent card game. imo the pricing system and the gameplay are good, but there are some things that need some work.
I think its a great cardgame, with much potential.
For a TCG its not that expensive, and its without paying additional money a lot of fun! If you want to invest for a cool deck, then the Market is a great option.
The Game has some flaws, but its the first set of Cards, so there will be a lot more Tactics and Strategy in the future.
Mostly writing this to fight all the unfair negative reviews out there right now. It's a great game, and everyone compaining about not realizing they couldn't grind for cards when they got it should really read the description before buying a game. The monetization model has its pros and cons. I think it's groundbreaking, but there are a lot of articles out there that you can read on it without me restating everything here. And the gameplay is deeper than any other computer-based card game out there right now. Definitely worth the money if strategic card games are your thing, and it can be played pretty inexpensively if done right. It's still definitely nothing like the cost of playing pretty much any paper game.
Most of the complaints are on how you cant get free card packs. For most online card games, that is a very reasonable complaint. Though this one, is a very special case. You'll most likely have to acquire cards by buying them on the market unless you want to go the typical route of buying packs. The good thing about this system is that most of the commons are only about $0.05 (U.S). This meant, even though didnt get any expensive cards in my packs, I was still able to make 4 decks in under 10 dollars. I was able to buy the specific cards I needed to make the decks I wanted. I wasn't recquired to throw 50$ into packs and MAYBE getting the cards I needed to make 1 deck, maybe 2 if I was lucky.  Their deck building and card acquirement systems are a step or two above other card games. Even if you dont want to spend money on cards or packs, you can stick with the free gamemodes, like their amazing card draft. The game certainly isnt perfect and needs improvement to it, but with the way the game is built it doesn't really need a way to get free packs.
Pretty solid 8/10

While the rewards for actually playing the game are lacking, as there is no in game currency to grind for packs, the gameplay has been fun enough to keep me coming back for 20+ hours.  The game felt like it was built with draft in mind and constructed has even benefitted from that.  Excited for new cards to come and the release of some type of progression system.
The game is amazing and the negative reviews are just people complaining about the economic model. Personally I get more joy on spending 50€ on a new xpac on card game than most AAA games (of course some exeptions like RDR 2) so if you're willing to spend money on the game then buy it if you want the best digital card game on the market (my opinion) if you're not, then dont buy it.

10/10 I love it
Honnestly do not know why everyone is dissing this as pay to play. Or pay to win. Seriously, I paid for the game. Never more, I currently have 55 Event tickets and my cards are worth around what I paid for the game. If anyone feels that Artifact is pay to play, They are just not good enough. Maybe it is just some beginer's luck on my part. But if your good enough. You can play for free. And this is coming from someone who did not have beta access.
You know that nailbiting, base-race, holy shit we won experience you sometimes get in DotA?  
Artifact does that constantly, just that now you are in control of all five heroes. No more REPORT MID fOR FEED nonsense.

The game is extremely fun and well balanced. Due to the three lanes, you get cards that look stupidly broken in any other card game;

[u]Cheating Death:[/u] 
Permenant, allies have a 50% chance to not die on death when a green hero is in lane
[u]Time of Triumph: [/u] 
Allied heroes get 4 Attack, Armour, Health, Cleave, Retaliate and Seige Attack
[u]Incarnation of Selemene: [/u] 
Permenant, after you play a card, fully restore this tower's mana. (my fave, you may be able to play your entire hand in a turn, it even restores it's own mana cost!)

All these cards are fine. If you see that your opponent is going in on one lane, thats ok, now you can pressure their other lanes without resistance. If you want a card game with big balls here it is. No tiny +1 buffs only if you're a robot and wear a hat cards.

I have been playing the draft mode mainly and all games have been extremely close. I have won 'lost' games by sneaking creeps onto their ancient, healing salves at the last moment, juking damage to squeeze that tiny bit of damage needed. There is a lot of depth and potential for outplaying your opponent here. 

Like any card game, the RNG gives and takes, what makes a better player is playing around this uncertainty.

About the pricing, It's difficult to compare to other card games, the monetisation here and the method of obtaining cards are just so different. 
[b] In other games[/b], if I want a specific card there is no way for me to get it besides opening packs until I do, or dusting enough cards until I can afford it.[b] In Artifact[/b], if I want a card, I can buy it off another player directly. 

You get the specific card you wanted
The seller gets money into their steam wallet.
and steam gets a small cut...

[url=artifactgoldfish.com/prices/online/standard] Here is a link to see how much cards cost. [/url]
You should purchase the game depending on how you feel about that.

Alternatively, you could look at this game as a one off purchase and play the non ranked modes where you have access to all the cards for free.

For me, I'm really enjoying it, and will continue playing as long as I can
How to make a profit 
-Buy artifact 
-Don't open the packs
-Play keeper draft and draft expensive stuff
-Repeat stage 3
All and all this game is super fun and I fully recomande it (and I got 16 euros from 1 keeper draft feels good man) :)
The game has nice graphics and also gameplay is pretty good. It´s fun to play. I really like this game.... But just a little problem with getting cards... I would like to get added more ways to get cards without paying much money (I know, the price isn´t that big, I can play with more cards on phantom draft or win card packs) something like in-game coins to buy cards.
I love it. A lot of gamers are not too smart. Fortunately, they also don't have money, therefore, the games is not marketed towards them and those of us with money can enjoy this game with like company. This game is for smart people who also are good at holding down jobs so they have money to give to make this game flourish. People complaining about the market don't understand that the game has a multitude of tactics you can employ with whatever cards you have on hand. It's about making lemonade with the lemons you are handed. if everyone had all the cards their wouldn't be much variety in card tactics as everyone would just copy whatever cards whichever streamer they saw last night using.
The game itself is a lot of fun. 
The mechanics and visuals of the game are above ony other card game I have played.
I do however believe it needs some sort of way to earn tickets.
The core game mode is a draft mode where you draft a deck form 5 card packs. 
This means there is no real pay to win in this mode, but if you are really into drafting decks you will need to open packs or buy cards to draft a good deck. 
My only other complaint is that there isnt a custom 1v1 draft mode. 
Currently you need 4 friends to play draft.
I like the game, not as expensive as others would have you believe. Not to mention the developers are actually listening to the community and updating the game accordingly.
Very similar to paper tcgs and mtgo, with the added benefit of a completely free draft mode so even if you arent willing to spend anymore after you get  past the entry free there's still plenty of content.
 The best card game I have ever played. And you never have to spend a dime after the initial $20 buy in. A single turn of Artifact has more complexity and meaningful decisions than an entire game of Hearthstone.
The reaction from players was pretty predictable and also completely justified considering the fact that they don't completely understand the business model. It isn't perfect but i'll tell you this, it is comparatively MUCH better than other digital CCG's. If you're okay with other card games, you know which ones I'm talking about, then you will be satisfied with this. Here's why:

I spent $20 on the game itself for 2 starter decks, 10 packs, and 5 tickets. The only reason people don't like the box price is because it's required but all in all, it is a good value as a "starter" kit. 10 packs alone is $20, which is comporable to other card games price:value of cards. 

Then here's the important bit -- I spent another $20 buying cards from other players and got just about every card in the game, including legendaries, except a handful of the "coveted OP" cards, like Axe, which I find boring anyway. And if I want any of those heroes down the line, I'm okay spending the $5-$15 that they cost each, assuming I don't find them in a pack.

TLDR the business model of pay for everything is a HUGE turn off to players but when you look at it realistically, it is acceptable. My only desire is a competitive ladder, which is on it's way. 
GET THIS GAME. The animations, graphics, sounds, voice acting, music, detail etc are just out of this world.
This is my favorite video game of all time.  It has been getting a lot of hate because it costs more than a lot of video games, but compared to other card games it is very cheap.  The gameplay is unmatched by any other card game and it feels like any game can be won by any competitive deck if you make the right decisions.
No idea why this game is getting so much hate. They are quickly implenting improvements while listening to feedback and nothing is a deal breaker at the moment. TCG's are a legit genre and this one fixes a lot of issues you might find in other games. You can get the whole collection of cards for waaaaaaay less compared to other TCG/CCG's. The game is nice balance of mentally stimulating, fun, and addicting. If you don't like paying for games than I guess this isn't for you. Please let me know if there is a TCG with a decent following where you can get the whole collection for free. I love how you can sell your cards back into the market or recycle crappy commons. If you're low on shekels just play free draft until you feel ready to use your 5 tickets for expert phantom draft or constructed. The only complaint was how they gave certain people a head start during the closed beta. Not fair at all but whatever.
This game has great animations and all of the core values of any TCG. A variety of categories of cards, the rock-paper-scissor balance, and the thrill of collecting rare cards. Not to mention, you can find a match at any point in the day! I have greatly enjoyed it so far.
Good game, the most people who give negative reviews because of the price have never actually played a real tcg and think a ccg like hearthstone is actually cheaper.
It's a good game, a bit overated in my opinion. But defenitely okay to be a top esport! To say that it is one of the best childrens card games etc is really exageration, just play like 10 games in a high level LAN. Artifact needs way more to compare it to hearthstone, gwent or solitaire
Generally, it is an excellent game.
However, I think there are some slight disadvantage personally.
1.Players need to pay the extra charge for the card they want. (Some powerful and efficient cards is pretty difficult to gain unless u pay extra money for that)
2.A little bit long time will be taken in each game.
3.There is NO ranking system which I think it is really necessary for motivating players.
Anyway, I enjoy this game till now and specially recommend it to Dota2 players.
Coming from both Dota and Hearthstone, I had high hopes and have not been let down. Already incredibly deep and complex, I can't wait to see what the future holds for Artifact!
Most of the negative reviews are from people who wanted this to be and endless grind f2p game when considering in other games (perhaps excluding gwent which is VERY generous with cards) you will not get the same amount of value if you spend $20.
The game itself is very fun and you can see how it intertwines with its source material. The spirit of it seems to be play for fun and not play to grind. You can easily get the deck that you want and they give plenty of samples for you to try out.
Good game, bad marketing.
I have to be honest, this is a very good and innovative card game from Dota2 lore but I can't recommend it because of its horrible economic system.
It is simply impossible to get new cards without throwing in money meaning that unless you want to spend a decent amount of cash you can't really play the constructed mode (where you build your deck from A to Z with your own cards) in a competitive mode. There are still some modes available as free to play but you will not be able to enjoy the full experience if you're not willing to invest money in the game.
Hopefully Valve will get a bit more reasonable in a near future and I'll have to update my review.

Edit after latest update: Valve obviously got the message and balanced its game and added a progression system giving access to free boosters and tickets. This and an extremely fun and totally free draft mode now makes this game a solid one. Yeah!
Clearly most Steam users are too low IQ to appreciate just how mentally advanced Artifact is: just as Valve planned. This is a game for a well endowed player base that can afford digital card games which is the video game analogue to dressage. I thank Valve for having the courage to make this elite game in the age of casual trash like Gwent, Warframe, and Dota2. I know Valve will continue to curate Artifact for the few thousand chosen intelligent enough to patron this transcendent masterpiece.
From playing other CCG's, I understand the frustration from a lack of progression.  However, I like the attempt at different structures for games, and whether or not that is successful will be sorted out in time.  I can say that this is a finely crafted strategy games with lots of decisions and interesting plays.
Excellent skill-testing card game that respects your time enough to be affordable to own a full set (with Steam marketplace for buying/selling the cards!) and not trying to waste your time with awful f2p-style grinding.  A card game for actual card game players, not casino fanatics or jobless teens.
I love all kinds of card games including physical ones. This one of the best I have ever played , looking forward to playing more and getting better at it. Also very fair way to buy and sell cards to build better decks etc. And to all  the entitled crowd crying about have to pay for cards ....  you can't go to your local gaming store and play Magic etc for free , so stop complaining about this game. Its no different.
This is one of the best card games I have ever played. It feels like it takes some of the best qualities in all the popular card games, then adds a lot of strategic depth. I have won games I thought I was going to lose and lost games I thought I was going to win -> not because of RNG, but because the game allows you to outplay your opponent.

I find it interesting that some of the complainers are so addicted to skinner boxes that they are dissapointed this game does not have that. I play this game because it is fun, not because playing 40 hours will earn me a card.

I like how you can buy the deck you want immediately, lots of cards are super cheap. Buying packs not required.
If you want to play draft all time this is perfect, but for constructed you can buy cards for cheap on marketplace instead of opening a bunch of packs. 
The game itself is very balanced IMO, lots of games are very close to a single digit hp. If you lose you can almost always track back on where you played incorrectly.
[h1] As to card game genre, it is definitely a good and creative card game. [/h1] It is full of strategies with 3 lanes taken into consideration. Besides, the card selection and variety are abundant. There are so many decks and strategies to explore.

[h1] However, as for the business model it uses, pay to play ( expert mode which is the only way to grind for extra card packs ) is definitely not promising for this game's future. [/h1] Many new players would want to get new packs ASAP without spending extra money in the game since it already costs 20$ to buy 10 packs and 5 tickets. 

With 5 tickets, if new players begin to play self-construct mode, they are likely to meet with those rivalries who have the strongest cards in the game which also cost a lot of money. If they begin to play phantom draft mode, seldom will they get the card combination they want because of the rule of 4 different card attributes ----- black, red, green, blue. For those who do not want to spend extra money in game, surely will they not consider the third mode in expert match which costs 2 tickets and 5 packs to enter. 

[h1] Last but not least, RNG factor in game is quite annoying. [/h1] The fact that you cannot control friendly units to attack whichever enemy units or tower sometimes just drives me crazy, because at some critical moments, the attack direction for my units is actually helping the enemy. I do not know why they did not apply the game mechanism used in MTGA to every lane in the Artifact. 

Overall, I have used all my 5 tickets to play expert matches, among which I got only 1 perfect run in the phantom draft mode while the rest lost with no tickets back. Right now, I do not see any reason for me to stay playing the game. [h1] Fun though it is, there is also no progression system that awards players. The dev will add progression in the future update. [/h1] Maybe I will change the review then.

Edit: 
[h1]Dev added the progression system and promised to balance cards in the long term. [/h1]Although they did not change RNG mechanism, balancing cards is a good alternate choice essencially. Besides, dev should show ways to get reward in a more user-friendly UI. [h1]After the second update of the game, Artifact became a overall great TCG game for players.[/h1]
A lot of people make the mistake of treating this as a normal digital CCG. It's not. It's meant to be a digital version of how physical CCGs work. You pay $20 for 2 decks and 10 packs like a physical TCG then if you want more cards you either buy packs, like a physical TCG, or buy cards individually from other players on the Steam Marketplace, like the secondary markets in many TCGs.

It's a fun and engaging game. RNG is good RNG (RNG that you can overcome with skill) as opposed to Hearthstone's bad RNG (where entire games are decided solely by RNG).
Every time I lose a game it is to a card that is rare, and a card I do not own (or have seen).

Oh look a 20 tower damage card. Oh look a card that give all heroes +4 to every stat. Uh, OK. I guess I am not hardcore enough anymore (was I ever?) to play something where I have to spend an unknown amount of money to even PLAY the game. All the trappings of competition go out the window when the game simply is not available to me.

GG, Valve.

I suspect the monetization model will change. GabeN was ranting how if anything has 0 value gamers will exploit that zero to drive the economy into a depression. Let's just see what he does now that the reviews (ouch 55%) are coming in.

I am giving a positive review because Richard Garfield is a god amongst men. The actual game he designed (which I cannot play, even after spending money) seems really nice.
[h1]It's a fun card game[/h1]

Feels much better then other online card games with much more in depth machanics.
People may say that this game is super pay to play, however the purchace comes with a free draft mode that can be used an ulimited amount of times.
also if you are decently lucky you can get some rare cards with your starter packs and sell them on the online market place for more then the games cost, I got a drow who alone is worth more then 10 dollars
I felt the need to write a review about this game because of all the negative reviews. This card game is extremely fun, unique and complex. I haven't been as excited about a card game in awhile. I've played everything from MTG, Yugioh, Pokemon, HS, ESL, Gwent and even Infinity wars. 

I understand the frustration in not being able to do daily quests to earn packs. But their are plenty of options to enjoy with this game and there are plenty of cards you can pull with your $20 to put back on the market and make your money back. If your into drafting you can do infinite draft games which is my personal fave. And if your a competitive drafter you can earn plenty of free packs that way. The only way your going to pay to play is if you really want to create a competitive constructed deck and compete for packs/tickets. And with the option to essentially trade cards via buying/selling on the marketplace its a lot easier to get the cards you want. Instead of grinding days and days in HS.  Plus you can even recycle cards you don't need for extra tickets to enjoy the competitive modes. 

I would certaintly recommend this to any competitive card players especially anyone who loves to draft and play those modes in other card games. You'll definitely love this and if you play well the game pays for itself and more.
An actual TCG which is fully digital. Lots of ways to play even without more than the initial purchase. Great mechanics, great atmosphere, and has a lot of potential. 10/10 TCG
The linux support is a bit iffy, but I think this is due to the poor vulkan support on linux. Otherwise, the GL version still has issues with my dedicated card in my laptop. Other than the issues with linux, which let's face it, doesn't matter to most users, I would reccomend the game. It has an interesting take on the core mechanics of a card game, and a killer TCG system to back it up. Regardless of the current market instability, the cards are all cheap and always availible to the user.
 High in orbit, the Gitraktmaet motherships descend upon the Earth. They prepare to enslave the world and mine it for all its salt, but the scanners detect an abnormally high concentration inside a tiny shack in Greece. The invasion won't be necessary. "Lock onto him with the RNG disruptor," says the captain, greedily. "Soon we shall have all the salt we need."
Overall this game has a lot of potential. It reminds me in many ways of GWENT, but a bit more strategic and a bit less read based. 

RNG is rougher than this game than I first thought, but I feel it's a bit fixable. Biggest issue is turn 1 flop can make or break your game and if this was read based even or we had more counterplay options rather than just lmao you lost it would be better. Toning down some cards like bounty hunter would help too(I get it's not the best flopper, but RNG damage spike, and his 10 gold 3 mana spell is super strong if you get a kill turn 1.)

Only other thing is flops in general I wish there was a way to control where in lane your hero went rather than just randomly, like there are too many times where I get absolutely killed because it chose the absolute worst spot to go out of 7 possible spots.

Despite these complaints I feel like they will do something about turn 1 flop at the very least, and even despite that it's about tied with GWENT for me in terms of quality. Which is to say super good.

Draw RNG is lower in this game than basically any other card game I have played even better than GWENT I feel.

Monitization model: It's great, just buy the deck you need, treat this not like hearthstone or some gatcha game that path leads to suffering just play casual draft a bunch, then when you want a constructed deck just buy your cards just like you would in MTG. I bought some annoying control deck for $30, got mad last game when someone was running the top of the netdeck list swim's beatdown and thrashed the guy cause he made a few misplays.
Fun card game with interesting mechanics. I hear too much people are crying about the game economics, but the trust is nothing to farm or grid in this game at the current stage. This is to me a positive aspect of the game. Once you buy the game, you can play for free casual construct, draft and the deck events. It has no rewards unless you play with tickets (cost money) and later you got tickets and packs prizes, like if you was playing a normal TCG tournament in a shop. I also like that you can sell unwanted or duplicate cards or recycle them for tickets (20-1). The high cost of some cards is also going down as they become more available and fewer people try to speculate with them. So looking fowards the further development of this game.
Sadly, many negative reviews about the pay to win system are true. I will concentrate here mostly on the negative sides because they may be most important for some of you.

There are around 300 cards in the game now and for 17.95€ you will get 2 starter decks with 54 cards and 120 random cards. This sounds good but is by no means enough to be competitive. More interesting to understand the game are time limited event decks with strong cards that introduce into different play styles. However, as the name says they may only be available from time to time.

To build you first competitive deck you will need to invest at least 5-10€. The auction house is very well implemented into the game (lock here for Diablo 4 Blizzard^^). It is a joy to use as long as you don’t think about the money. Most cards are very cheap for 4-15 cent now and prices will most likely fall. A good deck needs a minimum of 49 cards. The most expensive card “Axe – a rare red hero” was sold for 16-20€ last weekend, the second most expensive card was for 12€. That means you decks may realistically cost everything between 5-100€. Indeed, the most expensive rush deck that hit me completely unprepared was close to 90€. The game gives you a one click option to buy your opponent’s deck or to safe all the information for later analysis.

The card prices are by far not the most negative aspect of the game. Most hardcore card game players will not mind about the prices. The main problem are the entry tickets (0.95€) for competitive expert play or arena. After 3 wins you get a new entry ticket and card packs when you win more. However, it is the best way to play for experienced players because you will learn here the most and the matches are very enjoyable. The people mostly know what they are doing, and they will fight until victory or death. The free competitive play is more for tinkering around and learning the decks, but perfect runs are not difficult to accomplish for more experienced players here.

In conclusion, Artifact is a freshly new card game in a unique mooba style. The game mechanics are pay to win, but they are very good and it takes long to understand the underling mechanics. It is something for people that like to customize their decks for a unique plays style. After 30 h of play I did only encounter two decks that were similar but not identical to my cheaper dark assassination siege deck. On the other hand I did encounter quite often variations of 2 very powerful decks that were most likely copied from some website, this does not mean that they always win (after a while you know exactly what to expect and how to counter; luck plays also an important role), more dangerous are unique custom decks that can surprise.
In the end the question is what you would like to enjoy most with you money. A visit to the cinema, unhealthy food at a fast food restaurant, or better a good book. Artifact is somewhere in between as long as you can keep it under control.
This game is excellent, and is in my opinion the best example of what a strictly digital card game should be (which is to say not an example of a real life card game, but an experience that can only work in a purely digital format).

The $20 price point seems steep, especially considering that cards need to be purchased, and cannot be received for free.  However, I'm excited to see what eventual ways Valve will come up with to receive any sort of free card pack (which I'm sure will happen due to consumer pressure), and in the meantime welcome the addition of the Steam Marketplace as a way to purchase and obtain individual cards.

Consider the initial price as not specifically PURCHASING the game, but getting you an initial buy in. Starting out gets you 10 card packs, 2 full decks, and 5 competitive tickets. It's an odd way to think about it, and admittedly gives Valve a bit too much credit over just saying "you're buying a game", but it's the angle they're trying to play, and I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Overall I'm going to be spending a LOT of time playing this game, and look forward to obtaining cards, building decks, learning strategies, and playing this on stream.
Everybody complaining about the price, monetization. Like shit this isn't your next Hearthstone, this game probably never gonna be as big as hearthstone but the eSports scene is going to be a LOT bigger than in Hearthstone. The game costs 19,99$ for a reason. Not everyone can just download the game and plague it with toxicity, abusing the 10Card packs, like I bet if the game was free and the 10 packs you get at the start of the game for free, if the game was free and it had that system, people would be creating dozens of steam account and abusing the system, selling those cards for money. 

The game is also taking a very balanced way on the RNG system, it's probably the most balanced card game at the moment.

And also, in 2019 Valve is already hosting a giant tournament for 1,000,000$.

And btw for about 5 bucks you can buy so many cards of the market, for 5 bucks you can boy tons of cards that are worth 30cents, the only cards which go higher than 5 bucks are normally hero cards.
This game is absolutely fantastic. Worth the cost for the free phantom draft alone. For those of you who don't know what that means, that is you can play as many times as you want with drafted decks for FREE!  

There are a few things I believe could be improved. It would be nice to have a way of acknowledging a good game. I've had many really close and tense games. In my last draft run I drew twice!

If you like strategy then this is an easy decision to pick this up.
Artifact in its current state is not for everyone. You have to play for several hours to start to understand its intricacies and several days to appreciate the genius of its design. Before you decide to buy it, ask yourself if you're willing to endure those first five hours of not quite knowing to do or what the correct play is. If you aren't, I'd suggest giving this game a pass, but if you are, a truly amazing TCG experience awaits you on the other side.

As for the monetization model, it's cheaper for hardcore players than something like Magic or Hearthstone, but more expensive for everyone else due to the up-front cost and lack of progression system.
A card game, for card players - perhaps not for gamers and certainly not for ALL gamers.

Go into it with an open mind (and some funds) and it will be a very enjoyable ride.
Large improvements over initial release - fantastic gameplay, higher skill level compared to many CCG/TCGs. Constructed & draft both extremely enjoyable, a pleasure to play. Given Valve's history and commiment to their IPs I have no doubt the game will only improve over time.

Well worth the initial purchase cost for free drafts alone. Marketplace is cheap* so further explorations into constructed will not be too costly if you love the game .

*releative to other CCG/TCGs
why the hell can i not change the language in ARTEFACT - it is stuck in german despite my client being english and clicking on change language doesnt work... would be nice if the drop down menue to change the language would be fixed soon...
I'm new to card games and this one got me hooked up for a while , after learning the basics you'll need a good 15 hrs to enjoy your first victory, then it's all about building a better deck, an ddictive one for sure. definitely a great game.
Despite people's gripes about the monetezation, Artifact is actually a really great game at launch.  There are some killer decks you can make with the cards you get for buying the game and then I'd say about a $5 investment buying some other cheap cards from the marketplace.  

I've got two pretty good decks with only spending that much and that is all you need to start enjoying the game.  The prebuilt free to use "Call to Arms" decks are also fun to mess around with if you want to try out some of the more expensive cards.  

The game itself is such a fresh take on the CCG card battle genre.  Having three lanes to worry about is really the coolest change.  There are tons of little things on top of that to worry about and optimize as well.  Having three lanes and choosing where to deploy heroes coming back, what items to buy and equip between rounds --- it all just boils down to having a bunch of complicated options that can feel a little overwhelming, but don't worry, one wrong choice doesn't neccesarily lose you the game.

That's brings me to the other really awesome thing I've noticed.  Almost every game I've played has felt close and kept me on the edge of my seat.  The way the game works is each lane has a tower with 40 hp that when it gets destroyed spans an ancient with 80 hp.  You win by either destroying two towers or destroying one of the ancients.  Sometimes you'll realize you're going to lose a lane and divert resources to another, but maybe your opponent starts to double down on the lane they're winning and it ends up being a race to see if you can get the two towers in the other lanes before they break your ancient in the lane they're pressuring.  Or maybe you have a hero coming back after dying with a cheeky spell to slow their push so you spawn them in there to disrupt even if they'll probably die.

Each match is full of difficult choices and a much closer ending compared to other CCG's out there.  I think that's ultimately what's going to help Artifact stick around.  That said, Valve still has a lot of work to do when it comes to activities/systems in the game that give the player a sense of progression, because there's pretty much none of that and getting packs is a rare occasion compared to CCG's with a little more genorous progression and card acquisition mechanics like Shadowverse.  It's not the biggest issue though.  75% of the cards in the game are less than 25 cents on the marketplace and about half of them are less than 10 cents.


Really, really good game. Incredibly deep and nuanced gameplay makes up for the lack of a rank system, which I'm sure is on the horizon.

If you want a challenging, fulfiling TCG, hop on Artifact.
As both a video gamer and a card gamer who has played many TCG's from Magic to Vanguard, I feel that Artifact is such a great mix of both. It has extremely complex games and yet it is so simple to just pick up and play. The visuals are extremely stunning as well. It also has so many game modes available to you for free; I especially found the tournament feature does very well to simulate playing the game IRL with a bunch of friends

The thing that holds this game back in my opinion is the lack of a ladder. But I think valve is already working on that. I can also feel that some people will complain about the added price of the game like for draft or expert constructed, or even just buying the cards. But I can say from my card game experience that Artifact is the cheapest card game out there. I understand that this game is not for everybody, but if you love video games and card games, Artifact is the game for you
This was the first card game ive played.  Tried to refund after 7 hours but was denied.  I was well over the 2 hour limit.  I would say it is difficult to perceive the value of the cards without playing, which is probably what the 'complexity' is all about.  This game seemspretty straightforward -- what you bring to the table and what your opponent leaves out.  The excitement ended over the next 10 hours as I tried to outwit the bots.  I played about 10 bot games and lost almost every one.  Somehow I did get matched against a real person who seemed to be in pretty much the same situation as me.  I think the deckbuilding accounts for about 70% of the total time played here.  I guess I wasnt expecting to spend down my Steam Wallet for this but it was very late when I found the "Whispers of Madness" card for $0.09 cents.  I went to the market and bought as many as I could afford which was over 70.  The card itself turned out to be nearly useless and priced accordingly.  I think I just wanted to commemorate day 1.  Then I opened my 10 packs and got a few $1 cards and a $2 hero.  Not knowing where to turn I went back to bot matches and spent the next 10 hours trying to build something to wit.  It didnt really work out.  I had a good laugh about it all
This game is more like chess than it is like a traditional card game. The gameplay is fun, the strategy is deep. There are some RNG factors, but not as much as other card games I've played. I see many bad reviews because people have to spend money to buy cards...welcome to card games noobs (HS fanbois). Instead of spending hundreds of dollars and opening packs like in MTG or HS just to obtain the cards to buy a strong deck. You can instead go on the Steam Marketplace and buy cards specifically that you need to build a specific deck. This is a much cheaper way to build a good deck. Card prices haven't stabilized yet (game just came out this week), but when they do, expect to be able to build decks for a fraction of the cost of other card games.

Also, if you don't want to buy cards after the initial purchase of the game you don't have to. You can play in user created draft tournaments with you friends, or casual draft against randoms. Either way, its completely free and you have access to all the cards in the game in draft mode.

The game is no where near perfect, there are some bugs and some badly needed features like progression or visible MMR, but knowing Valve they are working on it. 


So, you're thinking about buying Artifact? Have you:

-Wondered if you would enjoy the mechanics?
-Read some other reviews about in-game pricing and are concerned?
-Thought about whether this game is "for you"?

Well, this review should answer all three of those questions for you. It will appear lengthy (and will likely be a little lengthy) but I assure you that you this review will tell you all you need to know. I will section it off so that it is easier to scroll through.

Mechanics
~~~~~~~~~~

I won't go too deep into the mechanics as there are plenty of videos and reviews online that go into extreme depth, but I will go into the smaller details that I happen to find quite enjoyable.

--------------------------------------
-This is a MOBA in Card Game Form
--------------------------------------

For those who are strictly CCG/TCG players and are not familiar with a MOBA, look up some gameplay of DOTA 2 as that is the game this is based off of. 

For the rest of those reading this, I'll assume you have knowledge of both genres. The three different playing fields share the same hand resources but have separate Mana pools. This often leads to each player getting an advantage in one of the lanes, and they end up fighting over the last one. This unique design alone creates the tension of a "Snowball". We've all been in those games where one lane is super strong, but the other two are not. How you use that advantage is up to you, because...

----------------------------------
-There are TWO Win Conditions
----------------------------------

In order to win, you must destroy the "First Tower" in two of the three lanes, or you must destroy the "Ancient" that spawns after you take down the first tower. The Towers have 40 health each, and the Ancient has 80 health. While two separate towers might seem faster, there may be a time where your only advantage is in one lane, so you might want to try and hold off the other two losing lanes long enough to win in the other one. Needless to say, it gets complicated.

--------------------------------------
-Initiative is Amazing
--------------------------------------

I've read in one of the reviews that this system resembles "Gwent". (I've never played that one) Essentially, a player starts the turn with initiative and they are allowed to perform an action before the initiative is shifted over to their opponent. Obviously there can be a lot of psychology with this. There are cards that allow you to "steal" your opponents initiative as well; you can play two cards in a row or immediately pass the turn and maintain initiative going into the next lane. Sounds broken? Don't worry, it isn't as game breaking as you might think, but it is definitely a solid strategical mechanic.

~~~~~~~~~~
Pay To Win?
~~~~~~~~~~

Now, this is the part of the review that everyone is probably here to read: What are my thoughts on the in-game pricing model? Before I answer, I need to ensure that you understand the reality of a person who plays Competitive Card Games. "Pay to Win" is used slightly different in this genre, as it generally means that this is a person willing to spend money (regardless of the amount) to purchase the top tier, meta-relevant cards. 

--------------------------------------
-Have you played Hearthstone?
--------------------------------------

It's easy to look at the Hearthstone Model and say "I can technically get everything free, this sucks!" However, is it really free? How many max rarities have you received from the free-to-play quests in a month? How many times do you just grind the cards into dust because you have maxed out the limit? How much money have you spent on expansions for 3-4 decent cards? Can you remember how frustrating it was to never have received Dr. Boom out of a card pack, only to spend money on card packs to get the extra dust for one copy? Remember when they locked it out of competitive play? Truly, Hearthstone is ultimately a pay-to-win game as there is simply not enough time given to players to farm for the cards they want before they are locked behind a legacy-gate.

--------------------------------------
-Yu-Gi-Oh/MTG
--------------------------------------

To put this in perspective, you can head over to tcgplayer.com and do some searching for MTG/Yu-Gi-Oh cards. Avoiding the ones that are strictly collectible and have no relevance to the meta, you will find that cards can be as expensive as $80-$200 a piece. Keep in mind, in order to be truly competitive, a lot of these decks needed multiple copies of those cards. When I played Yu-Gi-Oh, it wasn't uncommon to drop $500 on a competitive deck, and MTG has decks that consistently reach $1500-$2000 easy. These games, while immensely popular, feature a pay-to-win structure. Booster packs are not truly as random but are intentionally prearranged to guarantee a certain number of each rarity per Box. (The container that the booster packs are shipped in) The cost for such a gamble is usually at about the same price as that card is going for as a single, and there is still no guarantee that you will get it.

--------------------------------------
-How Does Artifact Stack?
--------------------------------------

So now that we have perspective; the most expensive card in Artifact at the time of this writing is Axe; who is fluctuating between $17-$18 USD. A solid 98% of the market contains cards that you can get three copies of for less than 15 cents total. With that being said, it is worth mentioning that this is like every other steam game that allows users to sell and trade on the market. These prices are apt to change based on balances and what the community considers to be strong/rare. In a worst case scenario, you will spend more money on a single meta-relevant core card for a competitive Yu-Gi-Oh or MTG deck than you will with the initial $20 and then proceeding to purchase max copies of every card in the marketplace. Keep in mind, if you have a little patience then you will most likely get a return on the money down the line. In the meantime, practice the game! You are given 5 keys to enter the Arena. If you win 3 games before losing 2, you get your key back and can try again. If you win 4 or 5 games, you get free booster packs (they contain 12 cards each) on top of that. This is the equivalent of running down to the local card store and playing a quick tournament on a weeknight. Taking all of this into consideration, the game has some Pay-To-Win Elements, but ultimately the best cards are well within reasonable reach and are not locked behind a $200 paywall per card.

~~~~~~~~~~
Is This For Me?
~~~~~~~~~~

This is ultimately going to depend on the kind of experience that you are looking for. Are you a filthy casual, or do you plan to climb the ladder?

There are elements for casual players. You can play against a (surprisingly) strong Bot, even giving it a deck that you created yourself and having it act out as a sparring partner when your friends are away. There is an unlimited mode where you can play against other humans in the Preconstructed mode, or in the Shadow Draft Mode. This means you are not locked out from enjoying the full experience just because you don't want to drop some money on the Keys needed to enter an arena with prizes. 

With that said, this game was designed to be played as a Competitor. The complexity of the game as a whole offers a satisfaction that you simply cannot find from other CCGs at the moment. It is extremely satisfying to comeback from behind, or to completely dominate while ahead. There are some RNG elements, but even the "Cheating Death" card isn't as influential as you'd think it would be in the game. If you are looking for a way to challenge yourself to think critically and outside of the box, then you should pick up Artifact.
Overall the game is super unique and has a great deal of depth, if you enjoy deeper TCGs you will very likely enjoy this. Currently there is not progression like traditional online tcg's instead cards are either obtained from packs or the marketplace for real currency. Trust me this at the end of the day is better and you rather then dumping money on unending packs to maybe build your deck at most the meta decks seem to be going for ~50 ish  which coming from MTG is super refreshing.

If you dont want to ever spend money past the initial 20, currently you have unlimited phantom drafts and at least at time of writing can play in a gauntlet using some rather strong preconstructed decks against other precon decks.
Very interesting mechanics, I really enjoy the 3 lane system. The card art is beautiful and the attention to detial on the voiced cards is really impressive. Also your cards will hold value so you can sell them at a later time, unlike in most online card games.
Its a good game, just a bit long with regard to individual match lengths (although they do have a timer so there high end is capped, which is nice). I'd say the learning curve is a steeper than other card games as well.

There will never really be fast duels as you are basically playing 3 games at once with quite a bit of overlap to usually lengthen each. There is a ton of room for growth here and I see a lot of unique potential in this game. I admittedly haven't played a vast amount of card games, but it feels like this is something new for the genre and has some DoTA2 flavor influence and items/characters that add to the enjoyment for me.
I really enjoy this game. It is visually appealing and the mechanics are challenging with a high skill ceiling.

For those of you who play Hearthstone: If you like playing HS mainly because you can build a collection of cards just by playing, then Artifact might not be for you. There are no daily quests and getting free packs and cards is not as easy as in HS (there are free packs in Artifact when leveling up, until level 16). Artifact is for those who enjoy playing it with no further reward.

You dont need to build a big collection of cards to play Artifact. There is a phantom draft mode where you don't keep the cards you pick, and at this moment we also have the Call to Arms event where you can play with preconstructed decks. If you plan to play Artifact as a casual game then these modes may be enough for you.
I love the gameplay, games are about 20 to 30 minutes. They're complex and there are many options in each game. Even if you lose it's like a strategy game and you can analyze where you went wrong.

I quit hearthstone because after putting hundreds into it every expac and not having the ability to build the decks I want, I realized my stupidity. It took me awhile though.

Artifact's casual draft mode lets me play all I want and have a chance at all the cards. If you want to play the constructed mode competitvely you will need to spend some more money on cards.
Disclaimer: I recieved the game for free because I attended TI8.

Game is great, anyone complaining that the game isn't free to play needs to learn to read.  Right from the start they have always said that it was going to be a TCG model not a CCG.  If you don't like that it's fine, but don't give the game a bad review because you are too lazy to do the research before the game came out. 

The gameplay is deep and rewarding, and the fact that you can do free phantom drafts and make user created tournies with multiple formats is just icing on the cake.
It's a good game, I'd say pretty significantly better than hearthstone. It prices itself like a physical TCG, which I don't think is a particularly terrible thing. It'd be nice to earn more cards by playing but currently it's really just like opening Magic packs.

Overall, if you're looking for a very solid card game, and have $20 to drop on the game and $10 to $30 to drop on a deck (much cheaper than almost any competitive physical TCG decks by the way), then I'd say go for it.
I tried to put a lot of time into Hearthstone and just hated the fact that it was all about the luck of cracking a pack and getting what you wanted. 
I've put more then 6 hours into the game and loved every minute of it. I built 2 decks for less then 8 dollars, and had a blast playing some Casual Constructed. 

Pros - 
Requires strategy and critical thinking
Easy to pick up and learn after the intro
Cheap to build good decks
Love the design of the cards and abilities.

Cons - 
No ability to say good game or anything with opponent
*Personal Pet Peve* I don't have my collection memorized, so when I am looking at cards to buy and they are cards I already own, just put a darkened text in the list telling me I already own 3 so I don't have to jump back and forth between the collection and the buy screen
Want all the heroes 

Overall:
I love it, and will probably dump a lot of time into it. This will likely become my main streamed game and can't wait to get into more brewing. 

Note: 
I got the game by getting a Artifact swag bag at PAX Prime.
$20 gets you 10 packs, 2 starter decks, and 5 event tickets. Additionally, you have access to several free modes including free draft. There are no rewards for the free modes. Spending a ticket and getting 3+ wins means you lose nothing, 4-5 wins are profit. If you want to be competitive, you will likely need to spend another $20-50 on top of the starting price. This means artifact is closer to a normal AAA game price tag. And I think this is fair, as the game does represent a AAA digital TCG.  I built myself a very competitive deck day 1, complete with some of the most expensive cards (not axe, but the other ones) and have put up pretty crazy winstreaks. Right now I'm at 2 perfect runs in a row in expert constructed and 2-0 on another. What does all this mean? It means that no, you don't need to keep spending money to get cards. Because I have already gotten 4 more packs just from playing, and haven't made a dent in my starting tickets. Treat the game as costing $60 and you won't be disappointed. Or, maybe you are more of a deluxe edition player. $80 and you'll have the best deck in the game, axe, legion commander you name it. Game is pretty good so far, I would recommend to magic vets looking to try new games.
Hands down the best monetization model out there. You can draft for free and the cards are much cheaper than they would if you had to get them randomly as with all the other digital card games. Gameplay is definitely interesting but draft can feel predetermined if the enemy gets a couple really good heroes and you dont.
This game is missing a league and ranking system with match history and much more ... 
The game mechanics are very funny and allow a broad range of tactics - assuming you have the cards required (which can only be obtained by booster packs)
Totally worth buying. I've bought a game for 20$, sold 10 cards for 20$, bought 10 more packs of cards. Can do it again. And the game is pretty interesting.
I dont usually review games, but i feel i need to with this one

not only is this the most visually appealling card game i have ever played, but despite what many will say, crafting a playable deck is cheaper than most other games, like hearthstone, and it requires so much more thought and planning ahead than it. sure, this game is not friendly for f2p players, if you are f2p i would reccommend mtg arena, but if your willing to spend minimal amounts of money i could not recomend this game more
Okay okay okay, HEAR ME OUT

Yes, you can't grind cards out for free, game mechanics wise this game is rather fun, so let me focus on the business model since that's what puts people off.  I'll compare it to hearth stone.

                                                                                         Artifact         Hearthstone
-Buy/sell individual cards                                                ✔                   X
-Grind cards for free                                                       X                    ✔
-Mobile support                                                              X                    ✔
-Trade cards                                                                    ✔                    X
-Consumers decide card value                                       ✔                    X
-Use cards to get into pay to enter events free             ✔                    X


It's also worth noting that yes, Artifact does charge you more for packs than hearstone, but I'd say you get much higher value.  First of all, you're 100% going to get a card in the highest rarity bracket, and 3 uncommons, plus you always get a hero and 2 equipment cards needed for deck construction and you get 12 cards per pack.  Plus you can make budget decks that are affordable buy cherry picking them for literal pennies on the steam marketplace.   

Now yes, you can grind out packs free in hearthstone, but you can't sell them, trade them, and they throttle how fast you can grind.  You get one new daily quest per day which averages to me 50-60 gold over time, and need 3 wins online to get 10 gold so once per day with average grinding you can MAYBE get 1 pack per day for free.  Most people spend hundreds of dollars making competitive decks on hearthstone, in artifact, it's a lot cheaper overall, you're not going to build a competitive deck in a timly manner on hearthstone with how slow the grind in, you just aren't.

The starter set for artifact gives you 2 full starter decks which you can dismantle and use how you see fit, plus it gives you 10 packs for free.  

In the long run, this game is way cheaper than MTG or hearthstone if you do the math, you guys are crying because you can't spend 30-45 minutes grinding 1.5 dollars or so worth in gold for buying packs.  You can make more money flipping burgers in an hour and buy 7 packs worth of hearthstone packs from a fast food job and just save yourself time and get a competitive deck faster.  Not to mention all the money people spend on adventure packs that swiftly pull cards out of rotation for standard.


This is a great game with a ton of depth.  It is harder to play at a higher level with little experience compared to something like Hearthstone.  I would also argue, with some math to back it up, that it is much more expensive to build a deck using a ftp method, like Hearthstone, than a market driven system like Artifact.  You can build a very competetive deck for $15 or less and win some constructed gauntlets.  You don't NEED to use the couple of expensive cards.
Sorry it's not just Hearthstone Steam edition, but it is much cheaper than most card games (look at MTG where lands can cost more than the rest of your deck). Honestly I have no idea if constructed is any good or not, haven't played it yet. Draft is fun and you can do infinite free drafts (unlike Hearthstone). Honestly I have sold all of my pricey cards after doing keeper draft and picking based on price and literally made more money than the $20 i put into the game (and I only sold cards worth >$1.00).

Card games do not have to be free to play, if you want a FTP card game there are many other options, go play one of those.

As a side note card the rarity is much more reasonable in this game than most other card games. There are only commons, uncommons and rares. The game tells you what the odds are if you hover over the purchase pack button. 12 cards in each pack, guaranteed rare in each pack and packs contain 12 cards.
I think it's a good game, if you don't want to spend money on it (expect the base price of course) just play casual drafts, it's fun as well, although it could have a use of a free ranked version a lot.
I've played MTG for twenty years.  This game, from what I have experienced and read so far, is extremely deep and satisfying.  It costs 20 dollars and with that you get unlimited drafts and free events to play forever.  It has some continuing issues as of this writing with needing visible tracking of MMR; and obviously it will benefit, like any card game, from a deepening card pool as future expansions come out.  Overall I would give this game a 9/10 with what was delivered for 20 dollars so far.

The pricing compared to paper magic for building competitive decks, as of this writing, is night and day.  Artifact cards are cheap and mostly <$0.50 for cards that are staples.  (This could change due to market fluctuations.  I am not an economist.) And, if you only want to play keeper draft and you have a >55% winrate you will earn money for other games on the steam marketplace.  I really don't see any issue with the pricing model.  It does, however, require that you have some amount of money to play keeper draft and to have a competitive constructed deck.  This could be an issue for some.

I don't really know what everyone is complaining about however because there are fun free modes after the initial buy-in that they can occupy themselves with if they so choose, with more free modes possible going forward.  Who knows where this extremely polished experience will go if the community will let it.

TLDR: Well built game. Cheap overall pricetag for constructed formats so far compared to other games if you actually used cash to advance in them.
A good card game with a Traditional CCG business model. needs polish, but what doesn't at launch?

your $20 buy gets 2 starter decks, 10 packs and 5 event tickets. additonal packs are $2 and tickets are $1. I wish tabletop MTG was that generous.
First impression review - 

TL:DR -  Managing 3 lanes makes it more strategic , you probably should buy packs, but still Fun! No disconnects. Progression coming. 

My first review compared to similar games - (subjective of course)
Pros - Variety in Strategy, Sell cards, Great UI
Unique - 3 lanes, 5 heroes, Sell cards
Cons - Buying packs (optional), longer games (con for some), no ability to earn cards for free unless u win 4+ games via a ticket

I have played a few games since release and learning to develop a deck. I'm in no way good yet, but it's fun learning so far. There are counterplays and deciding how to maneuver the lanes based on the opponent's deck and yours. The biggest challenge for some will be getting the cards they want. You can RNG it with packs or just buy them. That option is great to me. I just bought the additional cards that I wanted on the marketplace. Trying to figure out how those cards play out in a real game is the fun for me as I see a variety of decks opposite me.

If you like a more strategic approach to fighting your opponent in a card game, this may be a good fit for you. If you hate the idea of buying packs or additional cards you may not like it at first. 

Graphics - I think the art style is great. I'm not looking for too much flash, but I wish the cards a little more "umph" to them (ala Hearthstone animated gold cards) Just for some extra flair. We like animations *shrug*

Difference in Artifact  vs Hearthstone - Obviously 3 lanes vs. 1 ... More variety in deck builds (5 heroes with their own abilities). More thought into plays (aka. Harder), You have to decide how to spread out your defense/offense based on the current field across 3 lanes. 

Length of game - The games tend to be longer, (approx 30 mins) I attribute part of that to strategy and people being new to the game. Once people figure things out, it will move quicker... I wonder how this will translate to mobile as playing mobile we want quicker games most times. 

Progression - Word is a progression system will be implemented. In the meantime, I'm learning the game. 

Bottom Line - It's not for everyone, but I'm enjoying it so far.
I already loved the game on lunch, followed all the updates since the first reveal during TI, and I can assure you that with the new patches the game got even better. Deep gamplay, games are always close, it's really rare that it occurs I stomp the opponent (or get stomped :P). Overall a great entertainment.
Extremely solid CCG, probably Garfield's best game since Netrunner. 

The monetization is less severe than physical Magic: The Gathering, and the market is not super inflated right now, which is cool.
 
I'm of two minds about the monetization. Other CCGs, like Magic, are much more expensive to play regularly. But a business model from 1994, which was predatory in the first place, seems not great. 

Still, it's a really well designed game.
The gameplay speaks for itself, although its harder to see that in just watching the game, it really needs to be played (which makes the 20$ upfront cost seem like a bit of a shame).  The RNG keeps games fresh while still being tertiary in factors of game win/loss, while strategic choice and deck construction are the primary make or break elements in the vast majority of games. (with the exception of two cards, Cheating Death and Ogre Magi that arguably present bad RNG).  Deck building is fun, although somewhat limited with only one set for the time being.  The drafting of this set however is incredibly fun and presents a ton of great variety.

The economic model works despite feeling greedy.  The Marketplace values of cards are incredibly cheap, and a top tier deck will cost significantly less than most other TCGs (paper or digital).  And we can expect values to continue going down as supply increases.

That said: Don't buy packs, just buy individual cards.  You'll ultimately spend far less.

Despite the game being fairly complex, the current set of cards are mostly straightforward and simple mechanically (some might read this as plain or boring).   This works pretty well for learning the game for now, but the future of the game is pretty exciting if they manage to capitilize on the potential of this design space.  Outside of managing resources and initiative (who goes first in a lane), the main interactions in this game are through numbers and colors.  You can do damage to your opponents' resources and you can cut them off from accessing spells.  There's a lot of intricate play around these mechanics, but I'm hoping future expansions add more avenues of interaction with the opponent.   And, of course, future sets means more synergies and playstyles to brew decks with.

And knowing Valve, we can expect the customization content to come inevitably.  We already have some nice tools for customizing tournaments and games with friends.

Really strong gameplay at release.
Market is intimidating but significantly cheaper than other card games (speaking as a Magic/Hearthstone player)
Potential is high for future sets / content.
Really enjoy the game and the depth of gameplay.  This is well beyond a "card game"; this is much more a tactical board game played with cards.  While the cards define what you can do and where things are on the board there is a lot more going on than just the cards which is where the depth of play comes from.  It was refreshing in the first several games I played with my own crafted deck (from just the cards I got from the 10 starter packs) that I immediately could see where I could have played differently or made better decisions.  I never once felt like I was at the mercy of the next card I was drawing or that the random placement of creeps/random effect of a card were what caused me to lose.  

A couple of cons.  

The iconography and display of key information in the game is a mismatch of ideas.  The status of heroes and when they are re-entering the game is on the top left and is very vanilla UI.  Improvements in the lane (resulting from a card played) are floating 3D water drops and can be easy to miss as many blend in with the 3D board in the background.  Rarity symbols on cards have a hover over text so you can see RARE vs COMMON but I swear some common cards look like they have a RARE colored symbol.  Also the card-type icons can easily blend into the backgrounds of cards.  

Matchmaking in the casual play modes doesn't seem to exist so its one game against a random junk deck and the next against a top tier synergistic deck.  Feels like the system, at a minimum, could try to match the power level of decks so that players can try out less ideal deck builds without getting completely random results.  The free casual modes are key to building confidence for players to take the jump into the pay-to-play modes.

In regards to the market.

Personally I like the fact I can buy the cards I want to play with.  I didn't think I would buy any cards outright on day one, but when I saw that many cards I was interested in were a reasonable price I pulled the trigger.  I spent $10 on day one to build out an entire Red/Black deck I wanted to try (note; I did get an Axe in my initial 10 packs which was one of the stronger Red heroes I wanted to play in the deck).  It was a great experience with the market and exactly what I wanted out of having a market.  I am not opposed to paying to have some fun.

As far as selling; I am staying away for the time being outside a few Uncommons I sold off to see how it works.  My cards were bought almost instantly above the rate at which it would have been better to just convert to Event Tickets.  Checking back a day later and price was about the same.
Artifact is fun, engaging, and a blast to play.  

I never thought I would say that about any card game.  Much more fun than any AAA game/console port that I've played in a long time!  This is a game worth paying for.  Its not a f2p grind-game imo.  

Valve makes quality products(imo), this is a quality game.
I think this is a good game and it's interesting. But after public test(one week), there is no balance or any updates. I think your attitude is not good enough.
Most of the negative reviews I see for this game are around the monetization system. This is NOT a F2P game. Let me repeat, this game does not let you grind for hours and hours in exchange for some free items. 

Instead, it's structured like many physical trading card games. Frankly, I think they have implemented an extremely fair system that completely eliminates the grind you see in most other digital card games, but I can understand people who don't know the model going into the game being surprised by it. In fact, they even have an open marketplace to buy and sell cards, so once the dust settles, picking up the cards you need for your decks is likely going to be much cheaper than in a game like MTG.

Artifact is by far the BEST implementation of a digital card game that I have ever played. The game offers a depth that you simply don't find in any of its competitors and the matches are exhilarating. As long as you understand the payment model in advance, this is an incredibly easy game to recommend.

Edit: Per the request of the community, they've now implemented progression (skill rating and account levels with rewards) as well as card nerfs and a card refund policy on those nerfs. This is a serious reversal of their previous stance and shows Valve is willing to listen to their players. Other devs take note!
This game is fantastic. I'm terrible at it, and have put no extra money in (nor will I until I can win casual phantom drafts reliably). But I'm still playing it, because it's fantastic.
A blast to play. I think all the pay2win concerns are unwarannted, because it's completely optional. What you get for 20$ is already a great game. Playing Gauntlet and phantom draft is fair and a lot of fun. 
I do think some minor progression system would improve the game, but it's not a severe flaw.
Credit card is not required if you are creative enough to create a deck with powerful substitute instead of rare cards.
Yes, rare cards are powerful. And Yes, they are somewhat valueable.
This is a model familiar to anyone who’s played MTG or whatever TCGs, buy boxes or boosters when new expac hits or wait for resellers. And you don't need 4 dupes of rares or mythic rares like in MTG. Prices are going to drop soon.
$20 tag for 10 boosters and starters is reasonable to me though.
Plus side
- Complexity and depth
- Free phantom draft match <- use this to improve your skill
- Pleasing visuals
- Music is amazingly epic
Cons
- No in-game progression for players who don't have $ to throw away
- cards linked to the STEAM MARKET and there're people who don't have game flipping the price

Solid 9 out of 10 for me
[b] Even casual and gauntlet plays worth money if you into card games. [/b]

+Artifact has more randomness than other card games, however players have much more things in their control. At the end winning or loosing mostly not decided by luck.(Except cheating death LOL)

+This game is pay to win ONLY in constructed mode as other card games. 

+This game has no in game curreny, IMO this is better than make you grind for few free packs for weeks, which will won't any help against paid players. (like some other card games)

+Matches are long: (20-40)min. Which make victories more satisfying.

-20$ is high price. However selling all the cards that given with game get your money back.(in steam ofcourse) 

-Buying tickets for expert play? Meh.
really enjoying the game the amount of content you get for 20$ is an avalanche i dont see any need to spend money on cards when you have premade decks in gauntlent and free drafts my only regret is i did not buy the game sooner
I think this is an enjoyable game which does many things right, but still has glaring flaws that need to be addressed.

Pros:
[list]
[*][b]core gameplay is great[/b] - lanes are an interesting and engaging mechanic, initiative system solves the "who goes first" dilemma and playing the game is enjoyable
[*][b]extremely high production value[/b] - amazing music, exceptional design and animations, tons of voice lines for cards, voiced lore for each card
[*][b]game modes are bountiful[/b] - there's a ton of game modes for both constructed (where you bring your own cards) and draft (where you create a deck by picking from new packs) casual and ranked alike and even a prize mode with money on the line
[*][b]tournament support is unparalleled[/b] - you can create tournaments with lots of parameters like deck restrictions, format, player count and more, join with your friends, or join an open tournament
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*][b]constructed is severely limited by the monetization[/b] - you get a lot of cards with your purchase, and you can earn some more by playing, but that's not nearly the whole collection, so if you want to experiment within constructed you'll have to buy packs with real money
[*][b]RNG feels unfair[/b] - while RNG is omnipresent in the genre and even games in general, it feels really bad in Artifact because it is very visible and notable: where creeps deploy, whether abilites trigger, and which arrows roll can sometimes decide a close game
[*][b]the core card set is dull[/b] - the current cards are mostly quite boring with lots of plain stat bonuses
[/list]
UPDATE 21/12/2018: Artifact now has a level-based progression system offering up to 15 free card packs as you level up, a skill-based ranking system and cards are now balanced iteratively in content updates.

Artifact is actually incredibly fun, incredibly deep and interesting and offers great, engaging gameplay with loads of unique game mode options and things to do, from social play with friends to casual gauntlets or expert gauntlets where you get to play for a chance to win packs and expert event tickets.

The preconstructed event mode going on right now is a lot of fun and the fact that you can do free phantom drafts in casual forever once you’ve bought the game is excellent.

The only bad side is that for constructed deck modes, this game isn't very generous in terms of how it's priced. $20 gets you a solid 200+ cards and 5 event tickets, yes, but from there on out, you'll be buying the rest. The good part is you don't have to just buy packs - you can go on the Steam Community Market and browse for single cards, find the ones you need/want and buy those instead. The market will fluctuate over time, so you need to have a keen eye and/or use third-party platforms. You can recycle cards into event tickets, which is something, at least.

That said, Artifact is a really great game and really unique in a lot of cool ways. It might be a card game, but it's a damn fun one, and it is amazing to see Valve collaborating with Richard Garfield on a project that does both parties justice. I would definitely recommend this; but if the monetization scheme has you on the fence, just wait for a sale because this game will almost surely go down in price over time.
actually this game not pay to win,  more like Gambling game XD
but the fact we need more money if u want to play competitively. 

if u leak of money i suggest to find some pack by playing Phantom draft instead of Constructed

If u have money u can play Const instead.

but i think this game still need progression or achivement for player, srsly.
it's kinda bored to just play Expert or casual.
if u already had all the card what u wanna do?

no goals?

that's all 
But still well done , 2 weeks since first release it's not a big deal
Review based on ~20 Hrs of Play.

Short Answer: I hightly recommend this game for 3 reasons:
- Very enjoyable game full of complex decisions on every turn
- The free casual phantom draft is awesome and makes every game unique
- The free preconstructed gauntlet is a great way to learn different cards and play a quick game when you don't have time to draft

Pros:
- I have tried numerous CCG's (Hearthstone, Gwent, Duelyst, Faeria, Eternal, etc.).  Artifact is the one I have found most enjoyable thus far.  Every turn is full of complex decisions: which heroes to place in which lanes, which cards to play where, do I let someone die so I can reposition in 2 turns of use my one item to keep it alive possibly sacrificing a later hero, etc.  
I believe this level of decision making coupled with the free draft system will keep me coming back to this game for countless hours of enjoyment even if I never spend anything beyond the initial purchase.
- The free draft system is wonderful.  This system allows me to experiment with drafting many different decks and seeing how they hold up without any financial costs.  I am thus encouraged to try strategies I normally wouldn't pursue which has led to some very enjoyable wins (and humiluating defeats).
- The preconstructed Call to Arms decks are a great way to learn about the cards and strengths/weaknesses of different colors to prepare for drafting.

Cons:
- The game takes longer to play than many other card games.  This is partially caused by the benefit above of many complex decisions for both players which take time to digest.  However, it also means I can't play a quick game in 5-10 minutes.
- It is not always clear what is happening with some of the cards/effects which can make it more difficult to learn.
- There is no way to earn free cards/packs.  However, while this is a con, I enjoy the fact that I don't feel any pressure to play every day or go after a daily objective.  I just play for fun whenever I feel like it in the format of my choice.

Overall, I think that Valve has created a great foundation for a game I will enjoy for countless hours to come and am excited to see where it goes in the future.
I LOVE the game. I have spent last 15 or so years playing TCGs, online and paper ( OK, when I started, there werent any digital games) 
First, the game si not sticking to the popluar grind/daily quest model, that either locks you to your PC/phone or makes you spend stupid amount of money at the end. 
Second, thw game is not rebranded, dumbed down Magic the Gathering - what most of the TCGs are.
Third, it is good, - deep, and with more cards, it will be only better. 
I think I will be playing it for years to come!!!
+ strategic, tactical
+ DOTA lore, superb voice acting & art
+ diverse range of cards
+ smooth gameplay
+ free casual draft for ever

+- Like every other CCG, this is also P2W, but it is one of the cheaper ones on the market.

- pay 2 play the game, maybe it could have been better to release for free or at least a better price
- games can take too long sometimes
- no incentive to play ranked --> no ladder, rewards
- no real distinction of the rarity of the cards when opening packs
Well, to summarize Artifact is a fun card game, especially if you like draft or arena mode in Hearthstone. I don't particularly like constructed in this game, because its pricey. But, I don't really care about constructed so its okay.... for me? objectively.

What I trully have gripe about is that there's no sense of progression. What the hell Valve, at least give us something to work for. Be it achievement, tittle, or in-game effect, anything for progression. 


Oh man, if Its just the core mechanic, this game got solid reccomendation for me. But the lack of feature in this game is painful, there's not even stats and MMR here!!
Garfield's still got it.

This game feels like the evolution of card games after a very long run of variants based off the MTG format/design.

I've noticed that much of the negativity around monetization is because of the lack of familiarity with DOTA 2. If this game replaced everything DOTA 2 related with DC, Marvel or other popular IP's like Star Wars or maybe even Lord of the Rings then people would probably be more accepting of the pricing and may even be willing to throw MORE money at this game. Paying $20 for Axe makes people rage cause they've never played DOTA 2 and don't know who he is but if that $20 was for Superman, Doomsday or Hulk it would probably not even be an issue.
One of the better TCG's I've played. Most games come down to the wire and end in a way in which you know what your mistakes were. The economy may turn some people off but the best constructed decks at the moment range between $20-50 and coming from the Magic the Gathering scene where that's usually the price of a budget deck and Hearthstone where you are grinding for packs or buying them in ridiculous bulk it's not too bad. The recent update to choose to buff and nerf cards is a very welcome change as well given Team 5's reluctance and "sit and see" mentalitiy when it comes to nerfing cards.
It's a decent game. I think with the Valve name behind it, it is a good investment because we can expect long term support and also a lot of interest and name recognition, which is important in online pvp games. Of course, the game does come with some downsides:

1- A lot of players had issues with the pay model: when it came out, you couldnt have any progress (free cards) without betting card packs or continuing to pay. They've recently changed that model where you can level up and earn free card packs/tickets.
But I didn't really have any issues with the no-progress-model- if you think about it, earning cards is basically earning money, and there have been a lot of players that have already broken even on their initial $30 on the game. With that said, gamers like pay models that are familiar and never like feeling scammed, so I can understand the backlash.

2- There was some OP P2W cards at launch. I think Ax reached $19 and Drow Ranger was $15. That was way too much for one single card, and it made the game P2W. They've recently nerfed the cards, but that also pissed off the people who initially bought it at high price and didn't expect nerfs. I'm happy they are finetuning cards, and I would expect nothing less from an online pvp game. Balancing must exist.

3- There's a lot of randomness in it. Creeps go in random lanes. Which unit your cards attacks is largely random. Some random spell affects as well, but they've already nerfed 1 major offender.

Positives:

1- Rush decks aren't as prevalent as other card games. The game seems to gear more towards control and small combo decks. Ofc, what that means is meta currently has a lot of slower decks, which is why im currently playing rush in constructed LUL

2- Valve brand and support

3- Tournament system seems to be very well developed, I think they are trying to push for heavy esports support if it picks up.

4- Very good polish, I think.

5- Game has some depth to it. I like the 3 lanes, although I wish there was more autonomy in terms of choosing direction of attack and creep spawns.
I really like the game. Its complex, fun and can fully understund the monetisation system. Then, why i'm voting no ? no progression system, no leaderoard, no sens of progression...i'll change my review when at least one of this is implanted.*


Edit : they did
Best Card Game Ever.

Hands down, it's the best card game I've ever played.

-- The games are really difficult, 
Which I think it's good. It rewards (most of the time) the better strategist between both players.

-- The games are really complex.
You need to keep in mind several things at once, not just the attack and health of the minions in play.

-- The games are really close.
Even against the AI, you never feel like losing by a downslide. You are going to mess up your opponent and he is going to mess you up. 

-- The game is really fun.
All the possibilities, champion formation and synergy, quotes between characters, different playstyles and the whole randomness of the 'arena' mode makes it really, REALLY entretaining. 

I was specting this game for a pretty long time, and I must say that I'm not disappointed.
The Reviews on this game are very mixed. And that is understandable.
I will try to write a good overview: I will write it as a personal story. If your not interested, just skip it.

Here I go:
Its true that this Game is ''pay to win'', whether this is good or bad, is up to the people themselves
I've spend 75euro on this game, (bought pack after pack), and at the moment, my Decks are decent.

- For some top Tier decks I still need a few extra cards: - Which (if they are available): you can buy at the Steam Community Market. 
This can be a downside of the game, you can shop for specific Cards, and most of them dont cost much. 
(making the ''pay to win the game'' option, valid)

- I am sure many people buy these Cards, I am running into Top Tier Decks 90% of the time, when I queue for Payed Competitive. (you can buy-in with Tickets and/or Card packs)
- I refused to buy specific Cards for the first week I played, since I find it somewhat lame to buy specific cards. 
- Then I found out, it costs me to many money to collect the Cards I want, if I dont do it.
(Cards costs 8.75 for 5 Packs, and I kept looking for Luna as a Hero. I could buy her for 0.08cents on the Community Market. Go figure out the cheapest method??)

The + point of this Game is, its extremely addictive. And fun.
It contains really deep gameplay, with this 3-Lane System. Every choice you make, matters, a lot. Also the minor choices.
You also get a lot of Freedom; you can also not heavily buy cards, and just play Casual Mode. I run into quite medium skilled decks 60-70% of the time there.
But do expect that the game costs 20-40 euro on top of the Steam price, if you want to play well in competitive mode. (These contain fierce matches where you buy-in, to compete for prices, in the form of card packs and/or tickets).

Another + Point; you can get really creative with this game. You can, for example,  play Keeper Draft for that, which is basicly a payed mode on the game, where chances are quite even and fair; cause the Decks are not pre-constructed: You build a Deck from the 6 Card packs you get, and the Enemy does the same.
+ All cards you select, you keep. Its a good way to farm cards. 

Once you have a good Deck, like I have now, after I spend 75euros, you can also start winning some Expert Constructed games; Here you play with a Pre-Constructed Deck, constructed out of the cards you own. Opposition is fierce.
Probably you can start winning here with less money spend then me, while, as I said, I started out buying expensive Packs instead of single cards, because I found it a bit lame to ''only'' buy my way into victory; I wanted to learn the game the hard way.
Also, you can play a bit better as me. I am not a pro, I'm a medium experienced card game player.

+ The Deck Builder is what makes this game shine. There are endless options and combinations, and it is just so much fun to get creative with decks. You are fully free to develop your Decks the way you want, for the good or for the bad, if you fuck up.
I dont want to spoil the fun, so you have to find out for yourself which colour combinations you like.

I always look for good reviews on a game, and I hope I gave you some information now, which helps you to make up your mind whether you should buy this game or not.

From me, it gets a: Yes. Its great fun!
(When you dont get mad when you have to spend a little more money then you had in mind ;))

GG have fun
A new experience in card games that offers a great experience if you are a fan of the limited part of TCGs.

The game offers very little in the way of ladder-grinding and ranking up. Instead it offers the players gauntlets where you play until you reach five wins or two losses. You can choose to pay a small fee to have the possibility of getting rewards on a win streak of 3 or more, but you can play without paying anything and just explore the games creative side if you dont want to fight for rewards. 

I have yet to touch the constructed part of this game so I cant say much about that part. I have however spent alot of time with the draft modes and am loving the experience. So far I've managed to draft for rewards with the starter set you get with your initial purchase and the thrill when you are fighting for that extra win to get some reward is very enjoyable to me. 

I am also very pleased with the ability to play FREE draft gauntlets when my luck runs out and I no longer am able to play for rewards. This is a luxury which I dont think any other card game has provided. You don't get to keep the cards in this mode and you don't get any rewards, but the game itself is so much fun that I don't see this as a problem. 

If you enjoy drafting and a card game with alot of interesting decisions with new puzzles to solve almost every game I highly recommend this game. As for the constructed part of the game I can only say that card prices seem to be on a decline so it will probably be more and more accessible as the game ages. Or not. Also noteworthy that you can sell cards you get in this game so your investment is not money down the drain as in HS/Duelyst/Eternal should you grow tired of the game.
If you want to play top constructed decks then the game will cost a lot of money, but likely less than a top tier Hearthstone deck. 

The important thing to realize is that there is a completely free version of phantom draft mode, and you can also create custom draft tournaments with friends for no charge.
Draft mode by itself is worth the $20. one of the deepest card games ive ever played. blends the best aspects of HS, MTG, Gwent and Dota 2 together. For people scared of paying money you can still get your moneys worth, just not the whole thing, but MTG and Hearthstone are hardly free to be super competitive anyway. Have gotten 50 hours of enjoyment out of this without spending any extra money and ill definitely get much more. 10/10
Feels like chess. People saying it's p2w go back to ur hearthstone wasting money, first time in a card game ever where ive unboxed 35 packs and made profit without even getting axe (the most expensive card) honestly you can tell this business model is just so accurate to what tcg should be. You can buy/trade/sell cards just like in real life. The card packs are cheaper, contains more cards, everything is tradeable/sellable or even salvageable for tickets. You cant ask for anything else.
My main game is Hearthstone. I have been legend more than a dozen times and it is one of my favorite games ever. 

Artifact simultaneously has more RNG and more decision making. 

Creep and inital hero deployment is random and all the targeting in lanes is random. There are various cards and items that allow you to manipulate this though. It is fun, but like in Hearthstone there are some games decided by RNG. The better player still does win the majority of the time. 

The community around artifact is toxic and elitist. Stay away from the subreddit, especially if you are new to card games. People attack you for valid criticisms, especially when it comes to the amount of randomness and the pricing model.

As for the pricing model, you have to buy cards if you want anything after the inital purchase. This does mean that your cards retain value. I personally would prefer a way to progress your collection without having to pay since I don't want to deal with the market, but that's just not gunna happen. If you enjoy the market side of card games, that's there for you. 

Richard Garfield's reasoning, as stated in his manifesto, was that free progression is predatory. Kind of ironic coming from the king of loot boxes himself. 

In summary: Artifact is a unique take on the card game genre, but does retain the mechanics card games are known for, for better or worse. Although you have to pay to progress your collection, there is still plenty you can do for free whether it's draft, constructed or tournaments. You can stick to the free modes as long as you like and the competitive (paid) modes are there for something more serious after you've gotten the practice in. All in all, it is worth the initial purchase.
Im going to tell you this upfront yes this game has micro transactions, but not to the extent people have you belive. You get 5 tickets to play expert draft and 10 card packs. Out of these card packs you can sell the cards you dont want for cards you do want on the steam market place.  The gameplay is best out of every card game i have played. The monetization is questionable, but still better than any card game i have played. You can get the cards you want directly via the steam market place. I recommend this game because it is fun and alows me to draft for free unlike most card games. The buy in is steep and that is understandable if you do not have the income do not buy the game. If you do have the income give it a shot.
Ok, so there's been a lot of mixed feelings towards Artifact (primarily its monetization). It's gameplay and balance is great and lots of fun. I'll try to keep it short. 

[u] Gameplay and Balance:[/u] 
The 3 lane system and 5 heroes creates a diverse setting. There are different combinations of decks you can create with different purposes. In addition to that, I felt that most games have come down to one last turn. Whether it be you defending a lane or you pushing for lethal on that last turret. There is some RNG from the placement of creeps and where they attack, but that doesn't determine the outcome of a game most of the time. Remember, your enemy is just as likely to have bad minion placement, bad draw, or whatever RNG decision in the game. 

[u] Monetization: [/u] 
So for $20, you get 2 basic decks, 10 packs (with 12 cards and guaranteed one rare, the higest rarity), and 5 tickets. The game offers two game modes: Expert and Casual. Each has phantom draft and constructed. Casual [b]does not[/b] have an entry fee while [b]expert does[/b]. You can play the game without spending more money in Casual mode. In expert, you pay one ticket for phantom draft or for constructed. You pay 2 tickets and 5 packs to enter keeper draft but you get to keep the cards you draft. The main game mode, at least in my eyes, would be phantom draft. In order to at least go even you need 3 wins before you lose twice, which is very doable. 4 and 5 wins give you 1 and 2 packs, respectively. So if you win at least 4, you are at a profit. 

Now for some advice, don't dive straight into Expert. Practice in casual and learn how to play the game before risking your tickets and packs. 

That being said, the game is fun. There are other game modes you can play that are fun, especially tournaments.
Still trying to get the ropes of the game but I really like it. Have come from a long time playing Hearthstone and other card games. 

For the people crying pay to win, have you ever played a card game? If anything this seems far less pay 2 win than something like Hearthstone which doesn't allow card trading or purchasing. While you can make a reasoanable constructed viable deck relatively cheaply (I did one season with an all commons and basic cards warrior), if you want to be remotely competitive in hearthstone there are very specific high cost legendary and epic cards that you have to have. Even down to rank 20 people are playing these high cost decks (which is why they had to introduce lower ranks because the new player experience was becoming utter trash). While you can craft cards from dust, the amount of card packs you need to open to get a decent amount is abysmal. Serious players are spending hundreds of dollars each expansion. In this, it doesn't seem like any individual card is really that deck defining, so while it might cost you a lot of buy Axe off the open market, you could replace him with a 1c card instead and still be competitive play viable.  

I'll be interested to see over time if I find I spend less or more on this than hearthstone. I can't imagine jumping into HS right now with au$28 and making a constructed viable deck.
Pretty good game. As a DotA fan, this game is perfect: it delivers more to the DotA universe, the game is extremely polished in that fact with new lore and heroes, and the voice acting is perfect. With the new update 1.1, where you can select the game feels so more immersive, and it's good that the devs already announced a new update next week. Valve is listening to the community feedback.
As a card game, it's a game that just started now and has a lot of potential. But I see a promising future for Artifact, with new updates and possibly new cards with new possibilities in the future.
Best digital card game I've ever played. Would recommend it for drafts alone regardless of whether you buy any decks or boosters, particularly after the 1.2 update.
Hey its Great and fun game. The current Event is also nice for people who dont want pour extra cash into the game.

Valve needs to tinker a bit and give us a way to farm cards for free. Thats all needed!
Artifact is simply amazing, and I honestly think that I've already had my best duel that I have ever experienced in any card game whilst playing a Gauntlet match.

This game has a learning curve, and it's steep. There's a lot of things going on all at once, and you have to balance the dynamic of playing three separate minigames all at once (while using cards to influence the other fields with specific abilities/effects that stay on the field.) The game has multiple phases, as any card game does. When first starting, you have your drawing, then action (any pre-action phase effect will occur before the first action can be taken.), Initiative on the action is determined by the player who passed on the last move, or for the first turn of the duel completely random. 

The action phase will pass back and forth between players, as you play cards, or pass, and as soon as both players commit a passing action, then the combat phase will begin, during which, all units will attack the card or tower they are pointed towards, and play will move to the next lane, and start again, until the third lane's actions are finished, then you will enter the shopping phase where you can spend the gold you earned from defeating enemy units during the combat phase, or using specific cards such as Payback, which will double your current gold. 

I find this system really unique and refreshing, as it keeps you on your toes, and allows for a true  back and forth experience that card games with turns just can't really supply, not even Yu-Gi-Oh! has this level of back and forth, since it's usually just one or two hand traps to stop your opponent, but here, your whole hand is your arsenal and you have many outcomes of what you can do, and react when your opponent takes an action or save your actions for a different lane if you feel that you've completely lost one.

During the Shopping Phase, three cards will be presented to you, one from the secret shop(a random item,), a random item from your deck, or a consumable for 3 gold which can range from healing your units to returning them to the fountain for a quick deployment on the next round... You can buy multiple items from the selection in the middle, which is the cards you put into your own deck, but the other options are single purchase and then the shopping phase ends when you're satisfied.


Following which, the Deployment Phase will begin, under which two creeps will be randomly placed onto the field in any of the three lanes for both sides by default, and then any hero that was in your fountain and ready to deploy can be placed into any lane of your choosing, but it's important to note that you can't control the slot if you place multiple units in the same lane or a unit in the same lane as a creep... It will be randomized.

This is one of your grand strategy moments where you decide where to place a hero where a crucial ability might decide the outcome of the duel, or perhaps block another enemy, or take out their tower; your hero deployment may make or  break the game, combined with your items, and action cards, your hero units are the most important part of the core experience and their placements can decide your fate of whether you win or lose.

Then, the Draw, and action all repeats again. When it comes to playing the actual cards themselves, you can only play cards with the same color as a hero you have in a specific lane, with the exception of item cards & consumables, items can be equipped onto any hero into one of their three slots (Weapon, Armor, Accessory), and consumables can be used on any applicable unit at any time, or to fulfill their effect. Any time you play a card which modifies a hero, that hero will be modified PERMANENTLY, even if it returns to fountain and is deployed again. But, knowing that, there's still times you should use your modifiers on creeps, it all depends on the situation. This game will throw a ton of scenarios at you, and you'll wind up in a ton of tooth and nail close battles which just feel great.

Getting to the Pay Model, I don't understand all the hate that valve is getting. The free modes offered are casual constructed, where you build your own deck, Free for all tournaments, A rotating game mode which is currently Call to Arms Gauntlet matches, which have you facing off with 8 different pre-constructed decks against other users using a gauntlet deck as well, (and these decks are very closely matched, the duels are almost always very close if both players are playing optimally.), Phantom Draft where you do a full draft, make a deck, and play with those cards (but you don't keep them, under any circumstance), and duel against other players who are using drafted decks. [important to note that draft decks have different rules from regular decks, and you can use multiples of the same hero, over 4 of the same card, etc, the game has no deck limit as well so if you wanted to do a challenge and use every single card you drafted, you can.] 

Plus, when dueling friends, you also have a slew of options, being able to do any of the previously mentioned above, as well as setting other restrictions and twists on the rules of the decks being chosen and such, such as only common cards. This is a TRADING CARD GAME, Not a Collectible Card Game, Each card has value, and that's why for the constructed modes you DO need to pay for the cards, and it is borderline impossible to play CONSTRUCTED without putting tons of money in, but that's any card game, and the free modes on offer besides constructed are plenty, varied, and a great fun to play.

Following the latest update, we now have a full-featured chatting system, which in these modern card games is actually pretty massive. Playing with your opponent's head and taunting is just part of the experience of physical trading card games, and now you can experience it here, and it's done in a way I absolutely love where your chat is done through the characters you control and therefore if you wanted to (as I do,) you could enter roleplay scenarios during the game. The lore of DotA is rich, and it's an absolute blast to try and speak through the characters as they would in their world, though the character limit is slightly restricting often having you to do 2-3 messages to fully get a small monologue out.

After playing this for quite a while, I think I can finally say that Artifact is the best card game I've ever played, and I can definitely see the Richard Garfield influence alongside with the collaboration with Valve, and they've gone and made the best card game out there; it's just a shame the concurrent player count is so low at this time. But that doesn't mean you can't find a match, it doesn't matter what type of match I pick, I have never waited longer than 20 seconds for a match, and it's often so fast I can't even cancel if I wanted to. 

I can't wait to see the future of this game, and I really hope more people give this a try, and don't buy into the whole pay 2 win schtick since there are so many generous offerings for the f2p players that I have literally sold all my cards and just play the phantom drafts and gauntlets and have an absolute blast.

P.S. When building a team, the first 3 heroes you pick will be the ones deployed at the start (in random lanes alongside the initial random creep spawns.), then the next two will come in the following rounds to deploy wherever you need.
Great game, very tense gameplay. I like the market, being able to buy whatever card I want is nice, rather than opening 100 loot boxes. My only regret is that I didn't open an Axe.
Great game, I see everyone here crying about not being able to get cards otherway than paying for them, well you're all idiots! It is an honor to give money to our dear Lord Gaben, so stop bitching and drain those cards !
I had a really good time with this card game so far.  The 3 lanes really mixes things up and makes this TCG feel fresh.  I dislike card games that are free because it takes the vaule of collecting the cards away. I think the prices are more than fair with lots of free ways to play. Having a cost to cards will prevent everyone from using just the top meta decks. Do rich people have an advantage, yes, but thats life.

This game is actually fun and entertaining. No one said it was gonna be free. And it doesn't have to be. You buy packs you play... like an actual trading card game.
I don't like how the only way to get cards in this game is to buy them either directly from the steam market, buy packs for €1.75 or with some luck and skill win them in a gauntlet which has an entry fee of €1. However you can just play draft, which is like arena in hearthstone and in my opinion more fun to play than constructed anyways. However if you want to play constructed and are not willing to pay any money in addition to the base cost of the game, which is absolutely understandable, I would recommend you stay away from Artifact.
I really like the game and understand the concept of it being a trading card game. I'm fine with that.

I do not like the fact that there is a card called "Cheating Death". I just want to surrender every time someone plays it, especially after I've condemned one....... or two............

Pls Remove Ty<3
Really good game. But, before you buy it, take a look on the business model. It's TCG based and may not be what you are looking for. You have to pay for packs and/or buy cards from the marketplace and there is no way to grind cards and packs just by playing. It's not a scam, this was announced far before the release. If you are not interested on paying for cards but still enjoy the gameplay, there is a free draft mode, but that is up to you
Loving it.  Players of classic CCGs will love that it captures the feel better than any digital card game to date.  Draft is amazing.  There are enough events and play modes within the game that there's something for everyone.  With the market, one can easily put together a decent deck for very little investment, which is inexpensive but enough of a barrier to filter those who aren't going to be committed to the long-term success of the game.
I would state that this card game mecanical wise beats heartstone in a heartbeat.
That is IF you like strategy.
In heartstone you have 1 lane , taunt and what not , beat life points win game.

Artifact has 3 lanes to play cards , 2 towers to kill or 1 tower and ancient ( 120 life points) vs 2 towers of 40 hit points.

The mechanic of creating a deck with 5 heroes with their own abilties makes it different then heartstone as wel.
The strategy behind artifact is all about outplaying your opponent on the right turns, (this is simmilar to all card games ,) future turns give more mana etc etc.

And to counter the p2w part i personally find heartstone ATM more pay to win then artifact. This is because heartstone cycles cards out and when you finally have some deck for classes all of a sudden you find yourself not playing standard mode and have to buy packs or dump cards to create 1 deck or buy tons of packs.

At this point sure, the players that stayed evenually have better cards then you do because of the lvl system you get more packs untill lvl 16 , total of 15 packs plus the 10 you get when buying it .

Now knowing that your heroes all have 3 cards , your deck which usely has 40 cards , you allread set for 15 cards for free basicly. only thing  you need to do is find the missing pieces.

Because the game has a low playerbase the market you can buy cards for 1 cent. 1 fucking cent. 1 pack in heartstone is 1,50 , so do the math, you can complete alot of cards for a little bit of cash(sure) or just lvl up to lvl 16 and you most likely will have your deck finished.

I would recommend this game because the mechaniics , strategy per turn , and the grafics. Forget about heartstone.

cons are low playerbase and we need new patch and new cards, but its in its first phase so im happy to grind :)
Gameplay is great, the monetization that everyone is complaining about is better than MTG:A and Hearthstone. You can play casual Phantom Draft forever for free, or you can get cards to play constructed by paying for them on the market instead of grinding forever or opening randomized packs. We'll have to wait and see if the first few expansions are good to know if the game is going to be succesful, but overall thouroghly recomended if you're a fan of TCGs.
Great card game. Price model is similar to other card games so i'm not sure why so much dislike. But, I will agree that there needs to be a way to earn tickets other than buying them. Everything else is fair IMO.
Although i believe there is some necessary adjustments needed for content such as a ranking system. The gameplay is exquisite. After the initial $20 spent on the game, I have yet to spend another dollar after 40 hours of gameplay.
Coming from Dota 2 I find this game quite enjoyable. I also got lucky with my card drops from the packs getting fairly strong cards. I think that if you don't play dota you're going to have a much harder time playing this game. There is also a bit of a pay wall, but there are also others ways to play that aren't based on how much extra you spent on cards. Overall, I really enjoyed this game in the short period I have played so far, and really enjoyed playing against a lot of my friends. This game is obviously not for everyone, but I think that you could also scrap a decent deck from buying some cheap cards off the market if you don't get lucky.
I'm sorry its not everything everyone wanted it to be. But yes it is a card game and a pretty good one at that. 20 bucks for starting price? Hell ya i'll pay it cause with that 20 bucks you get 2 starter decks and 10 booster packs. 10 booster packs is 20 bucks. If you don't want to put any money into it then don't. There are millions of strats. I've myself found a counter to the famous Axe card. Don't hate on the game cause you have to spend money on it. If you don't want to then don't
Truly an awesome game. I've spent over 10k hours in dota and over 1k hours in hearthstone, with several hundred in gwent and mtg: arena and this is by far my favorite. I get that people don't like the monetization approach but I'm somewhat comfortable so don't have to worry about it, I thoroughly enjoy the game and will continue to play it on an almost daily basis.
Really well made card game. It's not gonna be cheap to play competitively but for a casual card game player like me unlimited free phantom draft(this mode has no rewards other than the satisfaction derived from playing the game) is well worth the $20 price point.
This game is really, really good.  Nearly all of the negative reviews are from people complaining about the cost, not the gameplay itself.  It's true that you will need some disposable income to fully enjoy this game, but compared to other types of entertainment it's not really much money.

I have nearly all of the good cards and have spent maybe $60 total (on the game itself, plus the cards marketplace) -- which is the same cost as many other AAA games.  If I'm still enjoying the game when they release the next expansion, I'll happily pay another ~$60 or so for the next set.  If your budget won't support that, maybe this game isn't for you.

But it is a really, really good game.
Good:
Excellent TCG with groundbreaking gameplay and strategy like no other.

*Updated Dec 22 2018.  They have revised their system for earning cards and added some loose ranking systems.  It seems that they are listening to the players and the game is starting to take shape into something REALLY ineresting.  I'm surprised that after the revisions, cards did not lose value.  Rather, they are climbing again because interest in the game appears to be up since Valve has made some really good changes to the game after initial release.  I think they really have something fun here, let's hope they continue paying close attention to the game and updating it.
Artifact is a TCG based around the Dota 2 lore and world. *note* this game is not for everyone. The game mechanics are not difficult to learn but you have to play it to really get it and if you are just watching videos on Youtube or Twitch, they don't show the game for its mechanics and game play. From what i read  and understand, there is no real way to refund this game as well. 

Pros:
Game design and music is great. "I am a doggy". Casual Phantom Draft is the game mode I recommend before launching off into Expert Play. 
- This game relies a lot on your strategising and brain power. Makes the game exciting, and sometimes turning the tide gives a very high satisfaction
- THERE IS A LOT OF HIDDEN LORE! If you like that in your games, go and delve in and figure out what's going on and who's on who's side
- Unique gameplay. The game play for Artifact is so well crafted and unique that no two games feel the same. unless you are playing against a constructed blue-green with Kanna and Incarnation of Selemene. 

Cons:
- Currently no way to interact with other players
- Expert constructed is a field of pay-to-win. *BTW this will be the only game mode that really matters when it comes to pay-to-win.* - also note, cards like Axe and Drow are possibly the best cards in the game but do not worry if you don't have them in constructed. I've seen games where those cards don't get a chance to shine because of RNG.
- This is a card game, so you better be ready for some Cheating Death, Eclipse or Chain Frost RNG. 
- There are no in-game stats. This needs to be added as soon as possible, Valve. A proper ranked draft matchmaking would really be cool and create for some interesting competitive games.


Really great game.  Most reviews complain about the monetization model.  While there are totally things they could do to improve it, there is still soo much value and fun to be had for the $20 the game costs.

I love playing casual phantom draft ( no need to buy anything more than the base game)  against strangers, or running tournaments with my friends.  We are having a blast playing Artifact and I wholly reccomend it to you.

The game is tight, beautiful,  balanced and just so polished af.  It just feels so good in every way.  There is depth and strategy, exciting close battles and the game is skill based.  I love it.  Everything has awesome graphics and animations, every card has multiple voice overs, it runs silky smooth.   

TLDR:  I'm having  a ton of fun with this game.  I'm not coming from a f2p background, but I'm also not spending any more money than the base game to play this.  If you want to play a well thought out AAA card game: get Artifact.
This is a great game. First of all, I got this game for free because I went for TI8. One word to conclude the game : complicate. The game usually takes 20 mins per game and need to think a lot compare with Hearthstone and magic gathering. The cost of the game is really compare with the damn fuck hearthstone. The phantom draft cost nothing and to collect all of the card for the expert game I cost only 230 bucks. But I feel this game is still incomplete, I am looking for Valve to update something like the level system, rank system and some kind of daily quest system to help player to gather cards easier compare with now. Im looking forward about this game and is definaly a great game for sure.
Yeah it's pretty sweet. Not had to spend any extra money on it and been able to play the expert format as much as I've wanted. Game is good fun and satisfyingly complex.
Beautiful and unique card game. Best of it's kind. I love how developers try to create social and friendly atmosphere between community. And as for casual player that TCG model is really no big deal.

Thumbs up for Richard and whole Valve team! Keep up a good work!
I usually don't play many card games, but this is some next level stuff. The strategy and decision making almost always makes it seem like there's a route to winning a game.

And of course super polished graphics, card art, and amazing sound design.  All the card voicelines and interactions are awesome.

Gonna be playing a lot of the free casual phantom draft.
[h1] *For anyone like me who has been burnt out on Hearthstone please read* [/h1]

I've been playing Hearthstone since about the time [i]Un'Goro[/i] came out. It was the 1st card game I've ever played. I enjoyed it for quite awhile and spent a decent amount of $ on it (rough estimate ~ $600). I do not regret spending the money on HS packs because I got a lot of enjoyment out of my time with it. Recently though I've just become bored with it. The meta and game overall are just stale imo and I've been craving something fresh and exciting. I couldn't get access to the Artifact beta but I watched a good amount of streams on Twitch. So far I've only played just over an hour but I can safely say I love this game. It is exactly the breath of fresh air into this genre that I've been looking for. Mechanics-wise there is a [b]LOT[/b] more going on here than HS. That may be a turn-off for some people but I love it. It definitely took me a few hours of watching streams to really understand but eventually I got it. I just finished the 2 tutorial matches and barely learned anything I didn't know. Yes, the servers are crashing right now but the game just launched, I'm not worried about it I have faith in Valve to fix it ASAP. I'm sure I will go back and dabble in HS at some point but for right now I think Artifact is going to be my main game. Probably the biggest difference between the 2 games is the feeling of agency over the games outcome. It's a fairly common occurence in HS to either queue into an almost unwinnable matchup (and lose) or have the opponent draw perfectly and lose. The worst part is that it feels like [u]NONE[/u] of your decisions mattered. I guess we'll have to wait and see how the constructed meta settles with Artifact but I think it's safe to say individual decisions impact the game much more heavily than in HS. There is usually not just one but several points in the game you can go back and identify what caused you to lose. This difference alone is what #1 makes me love Artifact and #2 strongly think it'll be my main card game for quite some time. Wow, I wrote a lot. Meh
The game is great!  Monetization doesnt bother me.  Casual Phantom Draft is awesome and doenst cost anything additional.  I dont need to own all of the cards right off the bat anyways.  There are enough random elements and unforseen combos that allow the $$underdog to kick butt.  Perfect match for me.
I was initially turned off by the monetization model of the game and wasn't planning on getting into it.  After all, if Hearthstone and MTGA are free, why pay to play something similar?  

I was lucky enough to win a free copy from a generous streamer, though, so I thought I would give it a whirl.  I am glad I did.  This game sucked me in.  Even though I am a fairly successful F2P player on both Hearthstone (legend multiple seasons) and MTGA, the challenge that Artifact presents is just... phenomenal.

This game is not for everyone.  It is not nearly as casual as Hearthstone.  You can't play and watch Netflix.  This game demands attention.  And you will get wrecked, a lot.  But when you finally finish a gauntlet with 5 wins, it is immensely satisfying.  As for monetization, just play casual draft or casual constructed.  Infinite drafting for free!

10/10
The game is very fun if you give it a chance and ignore the reviews about the monetization. The constructed play isn't everything. You can play for free with the draft modes and as many others have said, there is a chance you can even earn packs via phantom draft/ keeper drafts infinitely.
It's a great card game, simple as that. Don't be intimidated by the gameplay, it is not that complex after you have tried the tutorial in game and a couple matches.

I think the price for the game is fair, it is the basic price for a starter deck in Magic: The Gathering, and you even get a lot more value than that. If you're lucky with the packs you get, you could potentially earn some of the price back by selling the most valuable cards.

I have not felt the need to buy packs, since the game has a bunch of options for playing free - for constructed play you can choose pre-constructed decks playing against others with the same decks, in addition to this, people online are constructing competetive decks which costs almost nothing if buying the cards off the marketplace (no, you don't need Axe or Drow Ranger to win in this game... ). There is also casual draft mode, which I mainly play, which costs nothing. 

The game is missing some key features such as a simple profile page where you could show off your achievements and collection, some simple progression either ranked or levels like Dota 2. However, I am sure these things will come in due time - It does not decrement my enjoyment of this game, I am just glad it's finally out. 

EDIT: These features are now a part of the game, well done Valve :)
I actually enjoy the game.

Its like a real trading game that costs money - but better! Sell the cards you dont like, buy just the ones you want.

Thanks Volvo!
I've had more fun in two days of Artifact than weeks of Hearthstone. As it turns out, providing interesting decisions during gameplay is more important than the ability to grind for cards.
Voting this up. Really enjoyable game and i don;t udnerstand people saying it's pay to play?? If you don't want to buy tickets for competitive mode just play casual, it's totally free and you can play any deck you want from what you own. Plus if you REALLY  need some more cards, aslong as you avoid the 3 or 4 super meta cards that cost £5 or so, you can pick pretty much anything up for under around 10p or less (GBP). 

I've spent about £20 and already got 20 hours out of this, plus many more playing around with deck builders. It's good fun, deep and gives plenty back. I'm sure lots more to come
If you are a true trading card player, and have been to a local game store, and bought magic the gathering cards. Then you will enjoy this game. You buy cards, sell cards, trade cards, play with friends and play in tournements for chances to win free packs.

I think most people have already talked up the great gameplay. Matches are quite long each of my card games are around 15 to 30 minutes like an actual card game, and not a fast grindy card app on your phone.

Valves marketplace is known to have a great marketplace where you can buy and sell easily, and cheaply.  If you don't want to take a chance on opening a pack once you find the cards you like by playing the draft tournements you can buy most cards for pennies. The rares are just a few dollars.

Buying a pack is $2.00 and you have a chance of getting something worth more than $2.00 you can sell instantly.

There also digital cards so you don't have to worry about wear and tare and losing value.
Artifact is a card game with a good amount of depth and variety but isn't for everyone.

Generally, you have a lot options you can perform since you have no limit to hand size and you switch between three different lanes.  It can be difficult to read what an opponent can do because of this.

This game has drawn a lot of hate because of the card marketplace. I enjoy collecting cards with value over grinding for cards with my time, so this is not an annoyance for me but understandably so for fans of free-to-play games like Hearthstone.  If you absolutely have to build a top tier deck, this game can get pretty expensive.

As a card game, Artifact has some random gameplay elements that you can't control like where your creeps spawn.  I don't mind this as a casual card game player who plays to have fun, but this can be frustrating if you're fiercely competitive.
Now with the progression system, the game is almost free to play! You can get up to ten packs per season, and event tickets allows you to get even more packs, while you can still buy cards for a few cents at the shop if you want a particular one.

They also balance cards if needed! Now the game feels actually fun to play. Good job Valve!
With the introduction of a new patch, valve has shown they are willing to learn from past mistakes and have added a progression system allowing players to grind out a limited amount of card packs and tickets (to be used to play for prizes) per a season. The decision to undergo balance changes will make lots of players already familiar with valve games (most notably dota 2) excited, as the the introduction of such changes lead to interesting shifts in the meta, taking cards that were previously seen as overpowered, and bringing them down to a lower level all the while putting underwhelming cards into a better place. Overall, through every patch that comes out, the game is shiftiing into a better and better game as many social and quality of life features are being added. I would advise to check out this game if you were hestiant at first. If you are concerned about the cost there is a free draft put in place, and the majority of commons and uncommons cost $0.05, meaning you can make a surprisingly cheap pauper (commons only) and peasant (commons and uncommons) deck for tournament play.
Excellent depth of gameplay and game modes, with a familiar cast of heroes, items and mechanics.

Well polished and visually appealing.

Updates since launch have added a reasonable level of progression and reward for regular play.

Cons? Games can be a little too long and require a fairly high level of engagement. Could be pros depending on preference and mood though.

8/10 currently and will expect it to only get better as time goes on.
I enjoy the phantom drafts and don't really care about the skinner box of progression. I think draft (especially with friends) is worth $20. I don't really think at this point that I would spend money in the marketplace or on tickets/packs, because I agree with the negative reviews of constructed.

The game is a virtual TCG, with all the baggage that entails. I think the mechanics are solid enough to keep me engaged, but I'm not thinking about how long this game will be supported or anything.
Deep strategic and tactical TCG , in-game moves and decisions matter more than deck building (opposite to MTGA)
You can outplay your opponent by thinking hard, basically you accumulate small tactical advantages for several areas
(gold, hero, creeps, initiative...)  over the course of the game when suddently you reach a tipping point and the opponent position collapse , basically chess with  fantasy, magic and some RNG. 
Worth the money now with the new patch giving packs for free + rankprogression

I like all the updates the devs are making based on feedback. They even changed directions based on their own design philosophy of not tweaking cards. This game is amazing and has me much more mentally stimulated than Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering. Keep the updates coming and I'll keep playing.
People are over-reacting with the game, the game itself is pretty good and the packs compared to other games are far cheaper than spending hundreds of dollars to get cards people want. I think people are bashing it too hard, but it does have its problems with the fact of event tickets shouldn't cost nearly as much as they put it out to be and possibly be earned through in-game play or through events like the call-to-arms. I think the game can thrive if they get rid of that price, besides that the costs for packs and stuff are pretty reasonable and the market makes cards pretty cheap that you can buy some for cents to get packs.
This game is not for Fortnite kids, so they don't like it. For adults this is actually a very good game with depth, which the kids can't handle.

You play this game for fun and you progress through actual experience. Not for virtual coins and xp-points.

Give it a try, even for the free modes only it is good price. With the cards and tickets you get and can sell on the market it is a no brainer.
Overall I like this game and am happy that I bought it.   I would recommend it if you think the pros outweigh the cons for you (listed below).

PROS

- Fun Game, designed by Richard Garfield who knows his stuff.
- Higher ratio of skill vs luck in comparison to most other CCGs/TCGs.
- Ability to draft for free in casual mode (ie. you can play unlimited drafts with no extra cost beyond the initial $20).
- A good set of pre-con decks to try out during the "Call To Arms" Special Event which is still available at the time of this review.
- Ability to create your own constructed or draft tournaments and invite friends and post them publicly also.
- Very polished graphics and voices.
- Valve has proven that they are willing to balance cards when they realise that a card is OP.
- Weekly rewards for playing the game (no psychological pressure to grind out dailies).
- Dota themed (if you like the lore from that game, or just because of the familiarity it brings if you come from Dota).

CONS

- Launch was abysmal and caused the game to lose roughly 95% of players.
- Not Free to Play if you want to be competitive. No possibility of grinding to build a good deck, like you can with MTGArena.  If you want a good constructed deck, you must buy it.
- No MMR ranking ladder.
- Massive Paywall once you buy the game (unless you are content to play the non-prize modes).  In prize mode, you need to win 75% of your first 4 matches, otherwise you lose your whole entry fee.
- So much lost potential with card design - many cards are so bland and could have been so much more interesting.
- Too much RNG for my liking - and which is really "in your face" when it happens, creating lots of feel-bad moments.  Often when playing the game, thoughts arise like "Oh, you had to spawn right THERE, didn't you, or that arrow just HAD to go that way, right". 
- No cosmetics yet (although that will surely change in the future).
- Games are not quick 5 minute matches like MTGA or Hearthstone, you need to be able to sit and focus for around 15-20 mins each game.  (This can be a pro rather than a con if you like this aspect).
- a $1 million tournament was promised for the first quarter of 2019, yet we have radio silence from Valve on that and it's almost Feb 2019.  There is a real possibility it won't go ahead.

Overall, the pros significantly outweigh the cons for me.
252.42 is the cost of buying every card off the market.
154.13 is the cost of buying the top ten cards (1 for heros 3 for everything else) off the market.
22.56 is the cost of buying all the uncommons and commons off the market.
(02DEC2018)

After buying the the game (20 bucks because its the cost for 10 packs you get from buying the game.) you have to spend $0.00 (and still have access to all the cards) as long as you play against bots or stay in the casual que. (draft and comp decks.) 

if you go into expert play (before opening your first 10 decks) if your good enough you never have to spend any money to keep going. playing keeper draft, you give up 5 decks, keep all the cards you draft (if u see axe you take him, that will pay for 10 decks) if you win 3 matches you get 2 tickets and a deck, if u win 4 2 and 2 decks, 5 wins 2 tickets and 3 decks. dont open the decks, sell the rares you get to buy more decks, keep playing keeper draft for an infinte loop while building your collection to sell or keep. if your good enough...

In the end the fact you can trade cards with others makes this model better than the RNG of other card games. you know how much you will have to spend, then debate in your mind if you should just buy the card or go RNG and buy a deck. (the reason other games use the RNG route is because they make more money that way.)
The game is almost perfectly balanced in all aspects. The balance between luck and skill, rush and relax, collectionist and competitive players, casual and hard core, soloist and socialist. The average time per game is on the sweat spot for beginners, but I would'nt be surprised to see they reduce the decision time per turn in the future. The interactions between the cards is interesting, the initiative and three boards system makes this card game extremely different from the other game. Knowing some of the math behind the design, the game has provided a window for people to not lost to RNG. This is a perfect card game. As usual, Valve needs to do a better job at marketing and operating the game. The game needs to find a way to be attractive to more players.
Incredibly in depth gameplay and many options to play for free after the $20 entrance fee. The fee gets you 10 packs ($2 each), 5 tickets ($1 each) and 2 starter decks. 

For an additional $5 you can get 90% of the cards on the marketplace for pennies each. 

There are expensive cards (Axe) but I made a deck with a pretty good winrate without these expensive cards. Plus the free phantom draft is super fun. 

For a player like me who doesn't have the time to play for 5 years to grind all of the packs and cards, this system is easily the best for me. I have almost every card except for a few. 

This game is great. Just expect it to cost $40 to get most of the cards. (except axe. pray to Gaben you pull him)

oh and honestly... just wait a month. That price will shoot down.
Artifact is fun as hell. Great strategy, and the RNG feels meaningful

I think this game has a fair economy. Most cards are really cheap.

Phantom draft is an excellent free game mode. We can expect loads of new content from Valve over time. Look at Dota.
Ill prephise this review by saying two things.
1.) Im a very critical person when it comes to video games. Especially with so many simillar games already out.
2.) Monetization is normal for a game like this. Literally any card game (IRL) costs money guys, so cut the crap.

Going into Artifiact i was pretty skeptical after the widely negative response following its intial unveiling. 
However despite the card game genre being numerous in number, Artifact actually stands out pretty well.

Pros
1. Wide range of playstyles
2. Outside the box card game unique mechanincs.. feels like a game of DOTA
3. in game card tradeing and selling made easier then ever with the steam market "go figure"
4. Intensive play that can have you on edge, card play after card play
5. Able to examine opponents decks to alter or copy them for yourself "assuming you have the cards"


Cons
1. Only 1 type of card "pack" you can actually buy right now. It contains cards for every color and use, so you cant yet open specific colors of cards like a booster pack.
2. "Expert Phantom Draft" one of the more fun game modes to play, is SEVERLY unbalanced because you can use up to 5 of the same hero, so stay away from this mode if you want to actually have a chance to win some card packs.
3. While casual mode is very fun, players can leave the moment they are disatisfied. (Not a big deal)




Easy to pick up, beginner experience has been good thus far. I don't feel pressured to buy packs/cards. I like how you can sell cards for real money, putting real value on digital items.
The gameplay is really fun and deep. I initially told myself I was only buying this to play draft mode with friends, but the underlying game was so enjoyable that I found myself playing it on my own time as well.

On top of that, the card market is a fair system.  Prices are low enough to buy any individual specific card I want that it more than makes up for the fact that I can't spend hours in a tedious grind hoping to get that card either by chance or by sacrificing other cards to craft it.
Anyone criticising the monetization scheme for this game likely hasn't checked it out after seeing the marketplace.

In other card games, you're expected to open ~100 packs before you can construct some great constructed decks. In Artifact, the draft modes are done so well that you can essentially play infinitely for free..plus if you WANT to play constructed, you can buy a complete deck for less than $10..and it's getting cheaper all the time.

The gameplay is fantastic, and you can tell it's made by the MtG creator. It's incredibly engaging, and while i'm not a fan of some randomness, it evens out with highly skilled gameplay choices throughout every stage of the game. Great for any card game fan.
Overall:
Fun dynamic card game that puts a new spin on the usual formula. A challenging new experience which I keep coming back for more. Try and see for yourself.

Comments on the economy:
Artifacts monetization is a gatekeeping model which many have seemed to misconstrue as predatory.
You pay $20 to get an intro into all modes of the game. You can play in events and drafts forever for free if you want. 
If you want to get competitive/fill up your card collection of course you are going to spend money.  This model/market is cheaper from an overall standpoint for high end and competitive players as well. 

I love this game. Up until Artifact launched, I only had enough spare time in the last 5 years to play one video game - Hearthstone. As someone with a career and family commitments, I do not have time to be "free to play" with Hearthstone and I spend about $150 each expansion (i.e. three times a year) to get the cards I want. I paid to get into the Artifact "open" beta and from the moment I started playing I did not regret it for a second. The excitement I feel when I play Artifact is like discovering Hearthstone again - but different. The gameplay feels much more strategic and I feel challenged again. The music, voice lines, production values, everything with Artifact are all tops. There has been a lot of negativity about this game. To me, the negativity is completely unwarranted. I am really happy with how Valve have approached Artifact and I will continue to vote with my wallet.
Its the Dota card game.

Not the World of Warcraft card game.

Or The Elderscrolls Card Game, or Eternal.

Its def not Duelyst.

Its more like Gwent.

Its not like Shadowverse.
The game is very fun in my opinion and honestly I am a big fan of the monetization system. If you want a certain card just buy it from the marketplace, and sell your useless/excess copies. 

This game is still cheaper than other physical card games with the most expensive card hovering around $21 (Axe currently). This beats out spending $50 on a teferi in MTG standard and having to have like 4 copies for your jeskai control deck. However this game is of course digital so I can see that counter argument and accept it as a reasonable reason to dislike this model.

As for comparing this game to other digital card games I still believe this games system is superior in most cases. You can get any card to build any deck any time you want as long as you're willing to drop a little money (the most expensive competitive decks seem to cost like $50 currently). Yes it sucks to not be able to earn cards in the traditional f2p way, this is actually cheaper in the long run. You can save yourself an immense amount of time by getting the specific cards you want anytime, and possibly even money since you don't HAVE to waste money on packs.

These are all personal opinions and I do not disagree with anyone who is not a fan of this model, I just happen to like it since I'm willing to drop the money to have what I want when I want saving my time.
This game will be bombarded with negative reviews as expected but believe me its a good game. I purchased game for Rs. 1499 on 1st Day of launch and got Rs. 1371 back by just selling 6 cards. So effectively Price was Rs.128. At time of writing this review 56,240 were playing so of course this game is surely a good game. I would suggest mine way of playing it. Here it goes. 

[h1]1. Buy ASAP[/h1]
[h1]2. Open pack ASAP[/h1]
[h1]3. Sell costly cards ASAP[/h1]
[h1]3. Go and enjoy 1 Month of dota+[/h1]
[h1]5. Don't buy cards you want and wait for the market to settle. Means when Axe Price comes to Rs. 132[/h1]
[h1]6. Enjoy[/h1]
[h1]7. Add me ASAP so we can play[/h1]
This is a fabulously deep strategy card game, and the pricing model is fine. The people that are complaining about the pricing model is people who don't come from physical card game backrounds where a deck can run anywhere from three hundred to several thousand dollars. You don't even have to play constructed, draft is awesome too and free.
It's all a matter of perspective financially, however the gameplay is great and i think that's almost unanimous.
A very solid trading card game that is priced like a trading card game.

The free draft mode and preconstructed deck events are both really fun. If you like drafting more then anything I would recommend this game for you especially since you can run free draft tournaments with friends. Do note that you do not  get to keep the cards you draft in free formats. 

Constructed formats have people playing with their credit cards but that is more or less the standard with any TCG.

Price wise buying a top end deck for constructed expert formats in Artifact will cost less money then Magic or Hearthstone since magic rares tend to cost more and hearthstone doesn't let you purchase singles from other players. 

Common's and uncommons in this game are dirt cheep on the market place and its more cost effective to just buy the singles you need to fill in commons then it is to open packs.
Like any other serious TCG is does cost money, and it is fine. Once you achieve some skill level you can easily won some prizes and profit from expert mode. ALso, you can draft as much as you want in the casual mode. No other TCG has this option.
Grinding is not free if you waste most of your time on it instead of getting better in the game. 
Social system is incredible, you can create and join tournaments out of nowhere with chat and spectator mode available.
Really fun game. Disregard all the people complaining about buying cards without any way to get cards by grinding. Sure some cards are more overpowered than others but thats like most card games. There is still plenty to do within the game without buying cards. If you're looking to play this game competitively I would say it would be better if you buy cards but for casual players there really isnt a need to buy cards. Its a fun game though and it is way different compared to the other card games I've played and I think it is a lot more fun than the other games too. I would recommend this game for sure. 

But if you are looking to play this game competitvely you will probably have to purchase cards along with the game price. Although at the start of the game you do get 10 packs of cards and I recieved some pretty good cards from those packs. Also if you do play Dota 2 you do also get a free month of Dota Plus which is cool I guess. 

Cards on the market are not all that expensive unless you want to buy an Axe card because that guy is just kinda broken honestly.

Overall this is still a really fun game and I can find plenty to do in it without buying cards from the market even though if I do get into this game more I will probably buy more cards to increase the power of my deck.
The game itself is fine, There are large complaints regarding the pay-to-play/win aspects, But you can play this game without spending any money. Constructed Decks mode does require you to own the cards, Honestly though I've found this to be the most lackluster mode in the game.

You can alternatively play casual Phantom Draft matches where the game presents you with 12 cards to choose from. You select 2 and proceed, The game then presents you with 10 cards. You repeat this process six times until you have 12 cards, At which point the game resets you back to 12 cards and you repeat this process until a deck of 60 cards are amassed. From there you build a deck based on what you receive during the draft, Using 40-60 of the cards obtained. You do not keep these cards, But again I find that largely irrelevant since Constructed Decks are the most boring aspect of this game.

Your second option would be to play with the Featured Decks. This takes out any random factor from Phantom Draft as the game lets you play with 1 of 8 decks, Each deck contains a variety of heroes/cards however the contents are always set. When you play this deck you will always have these cards at your disposal. Opponents you face are other players also using a Featured Deck. This mode is a less intricate than Phantom Draft, However it's also a bit more fair as the only random factors happen during the game. Each deck can win, Whereas with Phantom Draft you can potentially be screwed over before you even start.


The only thing wrong with this game at the moment is the volume of actual cards in the game is fairly small. There's been no real news of an update for the past few weeks. As it currently stands you can easily get your money's worth out of this game, But that's about it. I'm hoping Valve doesn't drop this title due to the bad reception early on, It has quite a bit of promise.
If you love complex card games, this is close to perfect. It's a complex game, but not as com,plex as you might think, and you start getting better after 3-4 hours with it. I also really like the monetization part, because it's much easier to get what you want than Hearthstone. I definitely reccommend it, it will reward time and money spent with it
Great. The lack of a way for a player to buy a pack without paying real currency for it is a bit of a downside, but the marketplace more than makes up for it imo.
What a great game! This may not be for everyone but for people looking for a new take on CCG's and a new challenge this is the game for you! Artwork is amazing, gameplay is unique and the stratagy challenge is real! I also love how Valve is building up the lore which is great for emersing yourself in the world of Artifact!
I've not needed to buy a single pack thus far, and the "Main" mode of interest is one in which you literally need zero cards for. 

The game itself is complex and convoluted to start, but after that initial hump is deeper and more rewarding (much like Dota).  Of course, it's a card game - so there's inherent RNG, but the three-lane element of the game makes for minimized impact of extremely good draws / openers.  Quite enjoying this game, absolutely worth the $20.
If you are a fan of traditional, physical TCGs then this game is for you. Some people will dislike the pricing model, but as a former MTG player I find it very reasonably priced. More importantly the game is fun. My son and I don't 3 hours making decks and facing off. I played 1 casual phantom draft, and it was enjoyable as well. I be envision many hours don't playing and planning.
Artifact is truly a card game like no other. If you like card games you might wanna give it a try. As for the monetization, going infinite is easy, and I'd you like draft, you can draft for free! No grinding. Literally as much as you want.
Sooo much fun! The game design is great - so much to think about, so much planning to go into deckbuilding, it feels very balanced, lots of different ways to win - what can I say, it's a Richard Garfield game - it's perfect.

People seem to be acting like it's a massive rip off, (ignoring the game mode where YOU CAN PLAY WITH EVERY CARD FOR FREE) - but it's probably the best and cheapest TCG system I've seen so far. My most powerful deck design (that I was fucking smashing people with last night) was about £1 for all the cards. I was beating people who had the expensive cards, so yeah it doesn't feel P2W at all.

The value for money in terms of hours I'm going to get out of this will be up among the best games I've played I can tell already - I'm happy to support valves economy due to the fact that this is a fucking awesome game.

Well done Valve.
I love this game and I love the core concepts behind the game. And the challange valve is imposing on itself.

Topics:

1. Monetization/Gamafication
Be real anything costs money, Games need to be developed and developer need food and food costs money. So one way or another we are all gonna pay.
Question remains how are costs destributed. Other games with F2P models attrackt a huge amount of people with free stuff, in order to generate a populated game and then tax high paying customers for their well populated game, to finance it. Artifact sort of taxes everyone, but none to highly. I prefer this kind of cost spreading in a game. Everybody pays the same (I have differnt views regarding healthcare and such, but we are talking about a game here), depending on their playtime.
I say that because I am employed, have friends and family and therefore only a limited amount of time to play. Other games make me pay very deerly to only play a couple of games. So in the long run I kept droping them one after another. F2P only works if you got the time. If you haven't you pay and it is not cheap if you have to pay.
Artifact make everyone pay, but the price tag is reasonable and does not vary.

2. Player commitment and motivation
In any online game the quality of the game is drivin by its community. Therefore the motivation of the community to stay in the game very much dictats the quality of each player participating.
When looking at other games they do a lot to keep people playing their game (F2P content, let people invest themselfs with time and money). Valve seems to have reduced that motivation only to the core game itself. I love that decision. Where in other games, people keep playing because they have done so all the time and they will loose out on stuff. Or don't want to switch to another game only because they already have all the stuff in this game. Essentially making the decsion to stay not, or not entirly, about the gameplay. There is nothing to gain/loose in Artifact if you don't play. And if you want out, sell your collection and you´ll get returnvalue. Reducing your decision to: Do I enjoy the game?
This leeds to a community that is invested into the game, because it is a great game and only because it is a great game. That is a community that I like to be part of.
Safe to say: I hate gamefication of games. I play a games because I like the core gameplay. All other reasons are a coverup for bad core game mechanics, imho.

3. Gameplay
It is your standard card game with refreshing new mechanics. In card games you loose some games and you win others, here you play 3 simultaneous games essentially garanteeing, that you win/loose and go back in forth in a single game. I haven't lost a game yet, were I thought, well darn it that was out of my hands. And I lost a lot. There was always something that could be done.
Granted a lot of single cards have feast of famine typ of RNG, but even those cards don't spoil the game (yet; this would be my biggest opjection to the game). If Valve can reduce that type of RNG and introduce more good RNG (equal powerlevel, but variation), I think this will make for a far better game, that it currently even is.
This underline how good the core mechanics are and it makes me want to play more and see where this develops in the upcoming expansions.

All in all this is a game I see myself playing on a regular base for the foreseeable future.
Good as Magic, Better than Heartstone, 

Need a lot of Credit Card if you want to get really good cards,

But can still enjoy the game doing casual game and bots
Amoizing game, best card game Ive ever played. AND very fair. Ppl complain about a "pay2getCards" model, but for real, we have a phantomdraft mode where everyone has randomdecks which dont feed from ur collection, but a random pool available to both u and ur opponent. Can it be fairer? I dont think so. Valve did the right thing. Over the years, we became accustomed to a pseudo-F2P-Model, where you either have to dump huge amounts of time or money to have fun. Artifact gets rid of all of this. You can opt in to buy your way through all the booster packs for your own supreme deck, but you dont have to in order to have fun. You can play in a safe environment, where no one has the upper hand because he either played the game longer than you did or paid more money than you did. THIS is fairness.
This game is honestly something else.
Now, I get it, people complain about the cards system and that you have to buy new tickets to play and all that.
Sure, it is annoying and outright.. well, greedy, to have a system like that in place, while many other card games dont have that system.
Though the thing is, you can still play with all the cards.
The solution to all these problems are tournaments, granted you have friends to play with.
Or draft mode, which is probably the most fun mode regardless.

I bought this game and was unsure wheter I would like it or not, since I am not really a fan of card-games.
And man, was I surprised.
This game is a ton of fun, they even added a progression system recently, so you can play for a purpose too!
Getting the right cards and outplaying the opponent feels absolutely amazing. 
I would have never expected a cardgame to be this captivating and engaging.
Especially when you get lucky in a gamble and that gamble ends up winning you the game!

I really recommend this game, the economy isnt what you should look out for.
If you want to hardcore this game, yes. You will need to buy cards to make your deck and play competetively, but you can also enjoy it in a more casual enviroment and still have a lot of fun.
Gameplaywise this game is amazing and unique though!
Fantastically deep game. Valve has gone above and beyond, both with the game itself and listening to community feedback. Having the ability to buy whatever you want is a godsend for competitive players, and the (now ridiculous) amount of free things to do is unprecedented. Not to mention the tournament support and even more things to come.
I wish Artifact had a mixed button for review.

I spent around $60 on a deck (partially funded by draft wins) then it got nerfed into tier 2-3 status.  I am way more upset that the deck is now ruined than about the money, but now that I've spent the money I can't transition to another deck.

I mostly play draft, with 11 perfect runs in expert/prize phantom draft. I wanted to get a top tier competitive deck. Looking at the decks from the very limited competitive constructed scene I saw three deck architypes that were dominant, Red-Green ramp, Black-Red aggro (tower rush), and Storm (Blue-Green Incarnation of Selememe rush).  Red-Green ramp had the most wins overall and looked to be the strongest.  However, since I play a lot of draft and a style very similar to the red-green ramp is very dominant in draft and blue is obviously the worst color (in draft); I wanted to play the most interesting and different deck, Storm.  I never thought storm was the best deck, its very vulnerable to a good player with a deck that allows them to choose judisiously when to kill heros, i.e. kill the green heros together on the same turn.  The deck is nerfed now.

  
Old review:
I've been having a blast.
Fun game. Free phantom draft alone is awesome! Once you learn the rules of the game (which takes about 1 tutorial game), the game can see fairly simple. But the more you play you realize how complex it is and howmany viable choices you have every turn. It seems like the skill cap could be very high.

But the biggest thing is valve is dedicated to the long term success of this game. As they have shown time and time again, they listen to the community and constantly improve their games. Not that they just go along with every whim of random complainers on reddit. They make necessary changes. I like valve.
I like this game a lot. It's fun to play, challenging and rewarding.
I'm a massive Dota fan ndn was quite scepitcal about this game, after having watched some of the early vidoes of beta testers playing this.
It seemed too complicated and confusing, however perseverence has soon made this a very thoroughable and frustrating game.
It requires a lot of thought during the gameplay, the strategy is a little chess like, although there are random elements to it, which is know as RNG (Random Number Generator!!). This RNG can irritate and frustrate when you have out thought and out played one's opponent only to get foiled by this element at the last gasp, thus snatching the proverbial defeat from the jaws of victory. 
Don't be put off by the complaints of pay to win, as a casual player there are enough variations of gameplay that require no cost in buying cards to enjoy the free elements of it (apart from the intial purchase price)
Of course the die hards may complain about the market and professional aspect of it, but I don't think it seems unreasonable to have to fund the cost of development.
The card appearances are not exactly to my taste, I think they could have made them less 'arty and serious', and to make them more fun looking, especially when you compare them to the really awesome looking animations in the Gwent cards (Witcher based card game).
I hope this game survives and thrives. There are a lot of justifiable criticisms, but if Valve can take them on board and not get defensive but improve the gameplay regularly I will continue to play and enjoy this more than I thought I would.
I stroingly suggest watch people playing this over streaming or recorded content on the interweb to see how this works and whether the intial game cost is enough to tempt and tease one to dive into this universe!
I hope so!
Good Luck to all.

Great game. The engine is deep and allows for much greater experimentation and rewards skill much more than any existing online card game. It has a great company and a great card designer behind it, so we can only expect good things in the future. Yes it has an initial entry price, but it allows you to buy exactly the cards you want in the market and in the long run it is much cheaper than other card games which rely entirely on your luck in opening packs and giving you 25% of your value back for unwanted cards. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
Artifact is a CCG that sets itself apart from other card games in the genre. The gameplay is layered, complex, and entertaining and requires you to simultaneously consider so many factors. If you want gameplay that is actually challenging and requires deep thinking, this is the game for you.

My one criticism of the game is the payment model and rewards system. The fact that you essentially get no rewards unless you're getting 4 or 5 wins per expert run is quite unfair and costly. It is alienating to newer players as well as detrimental for retaining playerbase. I hope Valve changes this soon.
Game is fun, interesting, a way harder then HS and has a bright future. Yes, it has problems atm but game is out for only 2-3 weeks, so relax and wait for tommorows update. GG WP no re
Artifact is an interesting game. It's not quite a simple card game, but feels more like a turn-based strategy game. It's complicated and has a steep learning curve. However, once you start getting the hang of the game it becomes easier to predict plays and know your combos. I have spent a significant amount of time playing phantom drafts because I do not enjoy losing money by buying tickets and I'm still hoarding my tickets until I become a better player. The game does have some issues that will hopefully be fixed in the near future by valve.
By far the this game has the  best gameplay in other any game in this genre.

to those who complaining about the monetazaion scheme, YOU can play Phantom draft for FREE even in tourney mode. 
EVEN as constructed Mode you can sell of the cards you dont like UNLIKE OTHER GAMES.
you dont like a card? SELL it on steam market
I've watched countless videos and streams about this game over the past few months.  I only have a few hours as of writing this, although it has not disappointed.  I look forward to see where this game will go.
buy it, open your packs, sell the good stuff, and play phantomdrafts for FREE forever, what more can you want?
not only are you not forced buy anything after initial purchase, you also can be lucky and get some good return on the 10 starting packs. dont believe people saying you have to spend more money on the game if you dont want to, there are free friend modes, also the whole casual section with free phantom drafts.

I enjoy it, its fun to just mess around with different types of decks in drafts!

Keep in mind the primary competative mode for this game is DRAFTS, and you can play, as i mentioned above, phantom drafts for FREE to learn the game, you dont actually have to pay any money outside of the initial game purchase to play these drafts, they are located in the "Casual Play" You dont get any rewards, but you also dont have to spend anything to play it! play to your hearts content!
UPDATED REVIEW

Valve fixed MOST of the major concerns and are willing to work with the community and take feedback.  They addressed every major concern and are doing regular balance fixes.  I flipped a negative review to a positive because of this.
The game is a fresh and innovating look to the genre and in my opinion worth the buy. I personally play the constructed modes and 1v1 friends. The game feels like you could come back any moment, with getting stomped as soon as the game starts being a rarity. The use of items and modify cards to buff heros can drastically change the course of the game and bring you right back into the ring.

As someone who enjoyed the game from the beginning I have spent close to triple the cost of the game, however any "top tier" decks that seem to be thrown around as they are constantly changing during these first few weeks of the game can easily be aquired for 20 cents to a dollar.

For those unlike me who do not want to spend the money and would like a grinding/free mechanic that could aquire them cards are not given any chance to do so. I believe any kind of small system that maybe gave out a ticket a week, or even a ticket for 3 or even 5 wins in casual could possibly suffice and calm the community down.

I give this a 4/5 for my personal experience but until they find a more simple way to pander to the casual players it will still be difficult for most people to get into.
This game is a very mixed bag of emotions and it's really hard to say whether it deserves a recommendation or not. To start off the game is absolutely amazing, it's fun, interesting, and unique. Not to mention its on its first expansion and there are so many options for playstyle / builds, I can only imagine what future updates will bring. The game also showed a lot of promise with buying and selling cards from the market as well as the fact that nerfs / buffs would only be made if absolutely necessary in order to keep the market strong. The game sounded perfect, or atleast close to it. Unfortunately the game has no real drive to keep players playing and no real incentive to constantly throw money into the game. Since launch things have been the same constantly day in day out, you either play your deck you spent your hard earned cash on, or you draft up a deck and hope your matchups work well for your setup. This is the only real way to keep getting new cards and its by no means a guarantee. You do this in hopes that after some new cards you can spice up your pre-existing deck or build another deck entirely that might be fun to play. Sure you could play the prebuilt decks and, if you have the money, buy all the cards you need off of the market. But from what I have gathered, card games are about building a deck to call your own. They’re about playing with friends and trading your cards to make your frankenstein monster of a deck perfect against the guy who keeps beating you. This game is more similar to a TCG only your cards are not physical and its as soulless as playing against bots. The sad thing is that the progression systems that other card games have are put in place to keep people constantly playing / returning as they make it even harder to obtain the things you want until you inevitably spend money. I don't really want to see the game become a free to play fiesta that suffers from the same problems hearthstone and shadowverse has but I know that with its current state it won't hold up. I wouldn't be surprised if the game implemented daily quests, 3 types of currency, and a login bonuses in order to appeal to the digital card game players. Artifact is quite good and if you understand the problems with other digital card games then this should be a huge step up and a positive vibe all around.
Great game.  The best mechanics of any card game.

Don't be fooled by the crying, this is the best value ccg on the market.  You cannot realistically play HS or MTGA without spending more than you will to play Artifact - and Artifact is simply a better game to play.

If you want to buy the game and never spend another cent, there are free modes available that let you do exactly that - and you can get enormous time out of them, they aren't just add-ons.

I'm loving it.
If you have some ADD and need some meaningless numbers getting bigger to have a fun time go play some cookie clicker clone. This is just a fun card game that has a lot of personality and strategy. 

It's certainly not perfect and some quality of life changes are needed but it is no where near as horrific as people are making it out to be.

[b][i]Isn't this game like super P2W and stuff?[/i][/b]

No, there are free drafts and a premade deck format.  
It's rather "pay to play" constructed mode. Spending 
extra money won't help you win though, since Tier 1 
deck prices range from 30-60$ (very low for a CCG).



[b][i]What's a free draft and what's so special about it?[/i][/b]

Drafting is a format where players open boosters and 
have to build a deck from those cards on spot to play 
with. This game mode costs an entry fee in other CCG, 
so it's a dream come true to be able to open an infinite 
amount of booster packs and not having to pay for it.

A fun cardgame, and not P2W given how draft mode exists. You also start with more than enough cards to make viable decks (as well as 2 decks themselves.) There are a few "broken" cards at the moment (looking at you Cheating Death) that hamper the experience, but those bitching about having to pay are the type of people who think F2P is the only game type out these days or has never invested in real TCGs like Magic, Pokemon, or Yugioh style IRL. 

The game is complex but easy to learn I found. Tense, and some super close games make for great fun. You just have to decide if you want to grind forever to get free drops (hearthstone), or drop money for random cards (hearthsone and artifact, straight up buy cards (artifact) or play draft without having to own all cards in order to pick everything (artifact). I know my pick.
I have only spent an extra 3 dollars, and only have one rare hero who is not Axe, and I have won many games in all of the modes. It really does not cost as much as everyone is making it out to be.

Saying that, the game is not balanced very well. Too many of the "same games" over and over again, have not heard if they are working on rebalancing, but I am sure they will, because why not make your game better?

People talk about progression which is great but not always necessary, its okay to enjoy a game just for the sake of the game, and card games are a good one to do that with, that said steam achievments at least would have been shnazzy.

Overall it feels Valve was a little lazy but I think with a couple tweaks here and there, plus maybe quintuple the amount of cards that currently exist (because boring), and it will be a phenomenal card game to play.
Artifact is a new type of card game. It is a cross between Magic the Gathering, poker and chess. What I like most about it is that there is a good balance between luck and skill. The RNG elements of the game actually require a high level of skill to deal with. Since the state of the board is always changing based on the random way the game works as well as the oponents moves it makes it so the player with the most skill wins a lot of the time. What I mean is that a new player will not be able to just buy a championship deck and win. They must understand the dynamics of the game. This makes it so the game is less reliant on the best deck and more reliant on player skill level in dealing with situations.

The other thing I really like about this card game over many others is that you start your game with 3 of your best cards already in play! If you have played almost any other TCG or CCG then you know that you have to work your way up to playing your best by turn 6 or 7.
I wasn't going to buy this game at first after I first heard rewards are only available behind a paywall but I changed my mind after actually reviewing what comes with the game. A better way of introducing the game would be having the game for free and a $20 bundle for the 5 event ticket and 10 card packs.
As of the game itself, it's a well-thoughtout card game(with some balancing changes needed currently). And the ability to buy/sell cards on the market allows you to obtain cards you want for a cheaper price.

Also, if Gaben you wanna throw some packs my way for this review, feel free to do so. =D
Best TSG yet. It combines all of the TCG into one, feeling a lot like magic and hearthstone with a dota 2 twist. The heroes make it really fun. It adds the fun of a deck building game into it. (Your heroes can be modified, upgraded, have items, and get buffed/debuffed while lasting through death. When your heroes die, they will respawn in whatever lane u choose after 1 round.

Ignore the reviews about the cost. You can play gauntlets with pre built decks, you can do infinite phantom drafts if you know what you're doing (just win at least 3 games to get your ticket back). You also scrap extra cards for more tickets.

 Go into this game thinking its like poker or a real life magic the gathering (you buy card packs and drafting tournaments).
Honestly, this game is fantastic. It's very much like a traditional real life card game where you either crack open packs to get cards, or go to the secondary market and buy singles. Cards aren't expensive, either. The most expensive card currently is Axe at around $11. It's more of a pay-to-play than a pay-to-win thing, in my opinion. 

They captured the feel of a traditional card game nicely in that regard. I'd much rather buy cards straight up than crack open tons of packs hoping to get something I want, and I don't then I have to deconstruct said cards for a measly amount to eventually get what I want. 

As for the game itself, it really does feel like a MOBA, kind of. You've got 3 lanes, each with a tower and for the most part, each lane is independent from the other. Some cards have interaction between lanes, which is cool. 

Draft is my main method of play, it's what I prefer in MTG and it's what I prefer here. I can play practice drafts for free all day long, though I don't get rewards, or I can spend $1 on a ticket to draft in Expert (potentially going infinite, since 3+ wins give you back a ticket, 4 wins is 1 ticket + 1 pack, 5 wins is 1 ticket + 2 packs). 

The game design is pure genius, too. I like the fact that there's some interaction between players during play, rather than ok I'll play then you'll play type, if you get what i mean. Like Hearthstone and Pokemon TCG basically. Here, every round consists of 3 parts: lane 1, lane 2, lane 3. each with an action phase(where the players alternate playing cards), and the combat phase, where the creeps and heroes engage in combat. It's a phenomenal game.

One issue is the fact that the game costs $20, but it isn't much. It's just a bad thing imo because you're buying packs or cards from the steam market if you wanna play constructed anyway, of which they get a profit from. I don't really get why it's $20, to be honest.

Overall I'd recommend this game. I've had it since release and already sunk over 40 hours into it.
Great game very tactical, great animations and in my opinion good value.

There allot of talk about the way that valve have had gone about your ability to acquire cards but I personally feel as if it’s affordable than the other games in this genre out there.

Constructed seems abit stale atm but will improve over time with more cards and combos
After playing about as long as I needed to it's actually not a bad game. Hell, I surprisingly enjoy this than hearthstone in my personal opinion. Despite the game being $20 I wouldn't exactly say it's worth buying, but I think it's just a simple game to play when you're bored. The cards are quite balance, almost every color feels powerful and strong when you know how to use them. It's quite frustrating to play in a casual 1v1 match (maybe from the lack of players probably?), but I think it's fair to put up a challenge for yourself in a game where you need to think or go back to your deck and saying, "hmm this deck is not so good, time to edit another one". Overall I'd give it a 7 to a light 8 on this thing, wish there were more players.
 Best online card game on the market, combining mechanics of other titles and improving upon them. 
 3 boards simulate 3 rounds playing out at the same time and influencing each other, mana system prevents mana screw while allowing multiple color plays. Random elements allow every round to feel different from the last one, while substracting nothing from player's strategic decisions and their influence on the game.
 There are enough free modes to justify the price(casual draft, free preconstructed decks event, social play against friends or community) and market allows you buy absolute majority of cards for next to nothing.
 All in all an excellent game made by an excellent dev team, and unless inability to eternally pursue plastic carrot of miserable free to play experience is a dealbreaker for you, I can absolutely guarantee you'll enjoy this game. 
 For everyone else. You have phones, don't you? Go take a dump while grinding that free to play treadmill. I bet it's gonna be the highlight of your day.
Very fun! Can't wait to see how this game changes over time!

Costs aren't as bad as people are saying they are. You can play Draft for free, which is a pretty fun mode! I think Blue/Black deck is my favorite so far.
I would recommend this game if you enjoy card games. I personally find it much more fun than something like hearthstone because it has an added layer of complexity without relying on as many gimmicks. I've seen a lot of people complain about the business model but it was stated from the beginning and I think that it is much better than 'F2P' card games. For example in hearthstone (which a lot of people seem to want this game to emulate) yes you can grind cards but it takes so long and the random nature of aquiring cards means that to be competitve in hearthstone you have to spend a lot more money than you would have to spend in artifact. If there was a way of aquiring cards for free cards would have no value meaning there would be no trade system so valve can still make money. Personally out of the two options (I know some people will argue there are more options but valve has to make money somehow) I prefer this I think it is much more transparent and less money grabby than any other because I can buy exactly what i want. I think the people calling for gabes head over this really dont understand how this system works.
I dunno, I kinda like it.

Bought a few cheap cards, still got crushed by standard decks.

Read some review that said you can play "unlimited casual draft if you poor".

Shame on you, cringeworthy - anti P2W is a principle many gamers subscribe to - doesn't really concern your wallet.

I'm not that poor, but I've played 21 hours of casual draft - I love it.

I will not be tapping out my credit card on this game - yet still proper enjoyable.
Incredibly deep and engaging game, but has a decent learning curve. Pricing model is actually quite great compared to other card games, and over time will only get better
Admittedly, I'm pretty new to CCGs. I've dabbled in HS but never played MTG. When I was a kid, I played a TON of Yugioh, though. 
Artifact was the first card game in a decade or so that even sparked my interest, and the more I watched gameplay, the more intrigued I was. 

If you're interested in this game, read through the reviews. 80% of the bad reviews are not complaints of the game, but complaints of the monetization model. Valve has already implemented changes that allow players to earn packs and tickets simply by playing the game. Obviously you will still be charged $20 to obtain the game, but in my opinion the game is worth every penny. The three lane strategy implemented here is rich and deep. There is a ton of give and take and each and every win is exciting. You'll find yourself deeply evaluating what seem like the simplest of moves, because the card you're planning to play could potentially be more useful in another lane. 

If you are interested in this game I URGE you to do your research. Watch Twitch streams. Read articles (negative and positive). Understand that its a card game and if you want to be competitive, you will likely have to buy some cards, just like a physical battle card game. Don't give up on Artifact before trying it. I've truly enjoyed every minute of playing this game so far, and look forward to sinking many more hours into it.
I feel like I need to evaluate this game to balance the very large amount of [i](unfounded imho)[/i] bad reviews.

The pain point when you read all those bad reviews is not about the gameplay (which is [b]really[/b] great, thanks to the Magic creator inovative ideas), but about how currently you cannot acquire new cards just by playing, but by having to 'pay' for them.

Well, I think this point is moot because:
1. You do not need to pay for any card to play cards you don't own ; the pre-construted decks provides all the (great) cards you would want, even if you don't own them. This mode is also great if you like playing the game, but don't feel like having to theorycraft your decks
2. If you do like deck building, then you can play the free Phantom Draft mode that allows you to access literally every card in the game (for free!)
3. If for some reason you'd want to [b]collect[/b] all the shiny cards, then you can indeed buy them within the game...but bear with me about the card costs ; most of the cards are 0.05€, and the market is only starting to stabilize. If you complain about having to pay 10€ to buy Axe...well, you don't _have_ to buy Axe to have fun; you can just play another deck or in the free modes.
4. The recent update (2018-12-20) added levels you can earn just by playing, and as a reward you get pack(s) and ticket(s)

I understand some people wants to construct their decks precisely, and then you'd have to either be pretty good by gaining cards with the ticketed events, or resort to buying packs.

So, to sum up; if you want to play casually and have fun, the constructed decks/phantom draft are pretty great [i](and totally free)[/i].
If you want to play competitively, well, I'm guessing you'll have to shell some cash at the game (like you would for paper magic or Hearthstone).

tl;dr
The game is very good, and got bad reviews about it's buisness model. But 1) Valve changed that business model recently, and 2) you can still play plenty of different decks without having to pay anything. Go for it!
Actually good game, but everyone's crying about not getting stuff for free

Man I wanna live in a world where I can get stuff for free all the time too? Maybe I should go grind my life away in Hearthstone instead hahaha
I like this game. lots of lanes and stratz. card prices are coming down now so thats good. this game wont die like all say. i think the time is comin soon. i have 200 hrs + in Artifact and i do like it alot. way more depth that other card games. i suggest playing it and get your 10 free packs and lv up and get more packs. you will be awesomely suprized at how good it is and how much you like it.
I feel like I have to write a review to counter the review bombing from peoples issues about the pricing structure. Yes this game has issues, and yes there should be some sort of in game progression which the devs have said they're working on. But at its core its a fun game and probably so far the card game i've liked the most between this, Magic and hearthstone. 

Lets start with some criticisms "its pay to win." Not really no, at least not more so than any other card game. I've played HS more than this and Magic and never spent a dime and I stopped playing because it just wasn't fun to get stomped by people who clearly spent a boat load of money on packs. Its not worth grinding gold when ppl can just pay money to buy packs. Now you buy packs here but the gameplay isn't nearly as card dependent as HS. As in a good combo of RNG, strategy, hero placements etc can win you games against better decks in a way that you just cant in HS and even magic to a lesser extent. Speaking about RNG its not worse than either Magic or HS and IMO its actually better. All 3 use RNG to some extent HS and MTGA dont have abilities and spells with RNG but bad deck draws vs really good ones put you in an hole you can't climb out of that this game doesn't have due to each hero entering the field at specific times. Hell I had one game of magic yesterday where I had 3 straight turns I didn't draw a single mana card after using all of mine first 3 turns and on the 4th of no draw I conceded because theres no coming back from that. The random placements on the field of creeps and heroes and their abilities or spells are not as game breaking as that IMO. "You have to play to play" Yea I had an issue with that at the start but the card market is good enough rn that you can buy a ton of good cards for less than a buck right now and its better than opening card packs hoping to get a good one.

To conclude, the game needs a progression system, a ladder, and something that rewards you for playing if it wants to survive in the long run. But in its current state if you have 20 bucks its a fun game thats worth playing that I don't mind spending 20 bucks to enjoy. If you dont wana buy cards play draft or casual constructed they are fun. If you want a grindy experience thats more challenging and more fun than Hearthstone but dont wana spend 20 bucks play Magic the gathering arena its also a good card game, but I would also recommend artifacts gameplay over that in my opinion.
At the end of the tutorial, there is no way to get CARDS except after the official PVP game.

Although the core gameplay and DOTA's IP are very good, as an online TCG game, there is still a long way to go.
Artifact is a game of skill, patience, and deep thinking. I love the challenge it presents and it never feels stale or unfair. I wish its release had been handled better, and hope that the necessary steps are taken to improve the game. I'm in this for the long haul!
I Dont understand the negative reviews, Honestly very fun game and i havent spent a dime after buying the game. Stop Crying about Micro transactions, Theres plenty of things you can play here that dont require a damn thing other than having a brain, and knowing how to play. Great game and i highly recommend
So, as most agree Artifact is a ton of fun to play.

This review will then be targeted towards the marketing strategy valve took.

First off, the 20$ entry fee gives you 10 2$ starting packs, so it's essentially just forcing you to buy 10 packs to start playing.

Second, unlike in competitors. Artifact offers a free casual draft mode. This alone in my opinion as a TCG fan justifies the 20$ entry fee.

Third, card acquisition via microX is more generous than competitors. As it should be considering the 20$ entry fee, but remember. The entry fee is essentially just forcing you to buy 10 packs to play. Further valuing the $ to cards you get in this compared to competitors.

Finally, you can sell and buy cards via the steam marketplace. Meaning the players determine to an extent prices. But more importantly, meaning unlike competitors you can actually target the cards you want.

So it's in my honest opinion that for TCG enthusiasts this game is beyond worth the 20$ pricetag. Specifically for people that enjoy playing draft mode, this is a must have.

Oh and btw, MicroX aside. As a longtime TCG fan, the gameplay in this is incredible.
Reminiscent of the L5R living card game or the Codex card game. Very thoughtful game, but random enough to be tactical, rather than an excercise in number crunching.
the game is more complex than all the other card games out there so it makes sense that the devs will take some time to get the game into that sweet spot so cut them some slack the game is special in its own way and with the right tweeks it could be the best card game available 
PS: the timer change is terrible and it should be reverted
The good:
- By far the most polished interface of a digital card game I've seen (played Hearthstone, Faeria, Elder Scrolls Legends). Every card has narrated flavor text, the art is beautiful, the presentation is clean.
- Gameplay is rich & complex. Like DotA itself, this game has a steeper learning curve, but it also means gameplay is thoughtful & rewarding. Passing in one lane to achieve a double-kill in another is really satisfying.
- Community driven options. Players can host their own tournaments (constructed and draft), and while I have yet to dive into this aspect of the game, it's another feature that distinguishes Artifact from its competitors.

The bad:
- Cost*. It's very much a digital implementation of a CCG.

*You don't get all the cards for $20 - it buys you 10 packs, 2 starter decks, and 5 event tickets. Cards are acquired from additional packs, or from the Marketplace. [b]You can not grind for cards[/b]. This is certainly a turn off for some people (pick a random user review). That said, I think the F2P grind model trains people to devalue their time. While I would rather just have all the cards with the purchase (like a Fantasy Flight LCG), I prefer the option to buy a card I want from the marketplace instead of spending time grinding it. Also, phantom draft (you draft but don't keep cards) is free (this is not the case in other digital card games), and I've been able to win constructed games without rares.

Summary: The complexity and cost model make the game not for everyone, but it's really hit the nail on the head for me. I look forward to playing this for years to come.
Enjoying this game so much more than I thought I would. A card game more reliant on brain power than RNG is a welcome addition in my opinion. Every victory feels like it requires so much dedication, thought and precision and every loss feels like a learning experience. Wonderful game.
By far best card game right now.Complex and interesting,(draft is just amazing,but too small card pool atm for constructed, imo).It's not that expensive especially if u have brain and play well in gauntlets.Constructed decks are even cheaper than in ''free2play''tardstone.Game has just came out (already pretty well balanced btw,despite all the crying around) and ofc has some temporary problems,it all will be solved eventually and artifact is developing into true masterpiece.
Great game if you love card games - it's based on the rich Dota 2 lore

Cons: Business model is horrible for a company that made the best free to play game business model in Dota 2
If you're from the Philippines, we can sell it at discounted prices to help the Artifact Philippines community grow.

Suggestion: Make this a free to play game (Free Casual Draft for everyone!) and player numbers will surge
I've played a bunch of these card type games, Magic, HS, Gwent. I have also played over 1400 hours of Dota.  I feel like with this game Valve has distilled the essence of Dota into a 1vs1 card game. It's brilliant. I stopped playing Dota over a year ago, and I was interested in this game but wasn't planning on buying it. Luckily for me I found it in my steam library I think because I was an early adapter of the Steam controller or something.  Anyway I decided to take it for a spin and I am hooked.  I haven't spent any money on cards out of pocket. Though I have sold some Dota 2 and TF2 Items on the market to beef up my deck. I like when I beat someone only to find out their deck cost like 50 bucks for me to build. lol  Anyway if you like Dota 2 but want a quicker version you can play by yourself then this is it.  Heroes, Towers, Spells, Creeps, TP Scrolls, Lanes, Ancients, it's all here. So I don't know what everyone is complaining about with the lack of progression and all that jazz, don't we play games for fun? This game has put RDR2 and GOW on the shelf for me for the time being, I'm literally even writing a review about it right now.
Fun times, looking forward to this game continuing to develop and grow. It's neat how many ways the gameplay is reminiscent of DOTA 2 while being a completely different sort of experience -- relaxed and thoughtful instead of frantic and adrenaline-generating. Good stuff.
The Hearthstone Killer?

As far as TCG/CCG's go, I'm no veteran. I played Pokemon and Yugi-oh as a kid and some MTG during my college years, followed by a year of Hearthstone (effectively killing my interest in card games) before Artifact released.

Packs are (comparitively) cheap, the game is fun and easy to understand despite it's many confusing mechanics, and if you've got any experience in TCG/CCG's than Artifact will be very easy to pick up and Master with some grinding. The downside to cheap packs is that there is no way in game to earn cards, besides phantom draft which is quite difficult if you're underskilled.

Like any card game, the value of your deck is based solely on how expensive it is to build in IRL money. Steam has a platform dedicated to trading these cards away or just straight up selling them, that being said, I haven't been able to trade any Artifact cards as of yet.

Like MTG, you have various colours representing different strategies and you can mix and match colours to create unique deck archetypes. The meta will always kick you in the short-and-curlies, so if you want to play competitively be prepared spend money. Buying specific cards from Marketplace is more beneficial than buying packs, as you are guarenteed your flavor-of-the-week netdeck 10 win combo

7/10, Subject to change.
This game is not pay to win for sure, i instelled the game opened packs sould a few of them and build a decent deck and won easly. yes even agains peoples who have axe in there deck because Axe isnt unbeatable.
The monetary system is like magic the gathering.  Yes, one pays for cards which can be different than hearthstone, but unlike hearthstone, you could also sell your cards later.

The game itself is very smooth and quite fun.  There should not be negative reviews for the purchase of cards, as that has been their published model since the game was announced.
Artifact is the most complex CCG around, but has a level of depth that's unsurpassed.

Pros:
- Strategic decisions to be constantly taken 
- Very good back and forth model with Initiative
- RNG is not as impactful as in other games (no mana screw/flood like MtG, no random Legendary minion popping up like in HS)

Cons:
- Massive complexity, often not well explained in game
- Progression system is still very raw
So far I have really enjoyed this game, it is a card game like none other. With just the start 10 packs, plus selling the unwanted rares I have been able to build the deck I wanted.

But building additonal decks that are of any quality would definetly require buying more packs, what brings us to the downside of the game, the economy... The economy is structured more like real life Magic the Gathering instead of the f2p digital card games like hearthstone. I am mostly okay with this, if you want packs you have to buy packs or enter tournaments, I play Magic for many years so I am used to this. But many people will be unhappy with this approach

I do wish they would add some sort of progressive to the casual play, like just XP from each game that goes to an arbitrary ranks so there is something to strive for when not playing Expert. Also I feel like simply adding the ability to grind out packs from winning many games in causal and gettting your rank up would negate a lot of the bad reviews. In hearthstone it takes quite a few wins to save up the gold for 1 pack, but I feel like just having that option would make people much happier.
All negative reviews are because of the pay to play model.

The game is fun, just the need to constantly invest money to play modes is a turn-off.

Still would recommend if you're into TCGs.
well designed and balanced game. Bad setup at initial beta launch, new patches have made the game great. Drafting is basically free with the rewards for levelling up. Really enjoyable, not grindy games rarely won/lost by rng.
I bought this game mearly cuz of Dota 2 Lore and dota background, i ended up selling a bunch of cards (17 to be exact) and got 84% of games price back. And i'm not going to bother with the micro transactions since in this game even tho having all the cards give advantage but :

1-I'm not looking to play this game super competitively and just want to have fun and enjoy some dota lore.
2-Knowing when to play what card beats having all cards. Having OP cards doesn't mean you are on a disadvantage to a point where your hands are cuffed. 
3-In the future the price of cards in the market will deflate and every single card will pretty much be less than 0.5 / 0.2 USD

So first this is not really a complete review, but rather supplementary review to the others, that is out there. I haven't been able to find any one that has analyzed the pricing scheme of the game, so i thought i would do that, and in that process hopefully help you.

Currently the only way to gain cards in game, by playing and not buying from the market place, is by playing one of the game modes that requires entry ticket.

I should probably state that I don't think this I necessarily because Valve is and evil company, i fact really like them, just look at this platform where you currently is reading this review, it's pretty good i think. So why might Valve then not be giving you any cards away for free?

First: The game has a marketplace connected to it, where you can trade and buy cards for real money.
Second: The market place only works if Valve never gives away any cards for free, because otherwise it would devalue all the cards on the market place. 

Know how much is the game then going to cost you: 

(Disclaimer your price might differ, since you live in a different country)

The lowest cost for buying packs, comes when you buy 25 for 43.75 euros

The lowest cost for tickets, comes when you buy 25 for 22.5 euros.


So the big question is how much will you be paying for cards if only use tickets:

First off, as far as i am aware Artifact uses a hidden rank for determining your opponents, even in draft mode, so the average win rate will be 50% for almost all players. 

Second off, in draft and ranked, with tickets, rewards are the following:

3 wins: 1 ticket
4 wins: 1 ticket 1 pack
5: wins 1 ticket 2 packs

if you lose two games, then you are out. 

Be using math we can determine the chance that you regain the ticket you used as entry fee: 

ticket_regain_chance=31.25%

Then we can determine the average amount of packs pr. run: 

average_packs_pr_run=29.6875%

Then by using the geometric series (which in this case is ( 29.6875%*(31.25%)^n), we can determine the average amount of cards packs per ticket you buy:

cards_packs_pr_brought_ticket=43,18181818181817%

but what then gives you the most cards packs pr. spend euro:

well for buying cards packs directly that is:

packs_pr_euro_in_cardpacks=25/43.25=0,5714 packs/euro

but if you buy tickets, then it is:

packs_pr_euro_in_tickets=25*cards_packs_pr_brought_ticket/22.5=0.48 packs/euro

In other words if you only want to increase your collection, then buying cards pack is your best option.

At this point, I should probably reiterate that you can play the game without using tickets, you just won't gain any cards.

My opinion on all this, is that you become way more interested in each game, and never give up, because your money is on the line. But I also feel it's problematic you gain less cards by playing the game, then just directly buying the cards pack, but hopefully this can be changed by Valve.

Also the gameplay is just really good, so if you don't mind spending some money, then this game is leagues above Gwent and Hearthstone.
One of the best, if not probably the best TCG to come out in the last 5 years, yes you have to pay for the game however it gives over its inital 20 dollar buy in, in packs and event tickets. Plus you dont have to grind to make a deck you just pay the money for the cards which are fairly cheap. Also you can draft infintley for free a thing no other TCG does today.
The negative reviews from people who no time played and using this resource as a meme is utterly ridiculous. As someone who doesn't play online card games, this is insanely fun and very accessible.
A refreshing new concept combined with a beautiful artstyle. I can understand that people are not pleased because they have to pay for the game and for cards. But there is no need to buy the expensive cards. You can build strong and fun decks for only a few dollar. Beside that you can try cards by using featured deck. The social mode to challenge friends or host tournaments with them is a pleasant addition as well.
I have played the game for almost 40 hours now and i can say it is extramly fun in its current state. Buying cards in packs or from the market to compleate your decks should be relativly cheep, If you like draft there is very little need to buy new cards or packs as far as i can see.
This is a great card game, it has good content, nice graphics, requires you to think about tactic and fortunately too. But I don't like pay for play, you must pay to buy tickets for every activity in the game, only free if you play with bot or call to arm. Hopefully Valve will be adjusted soon. Anyway, I still want to play this game.
The gameplay in Artifact is spectacular. Whilst people are unhappy with the financial model of the game, there are many options for playing the game at minimal cost whilst accruing a collection. Playing Phantom draft to build up packs for the price of 1 ticket is reasonable and you almost always win back the ticket + a chance at some free packs, allowing essentially infinite play. Highly recommend.
Please Artifact I love your system. But you should fix this game ASAP.
I believe ppl stop playing this game because they don't have anything to do or spend anymore money without actual progression. My suggestion is that you should have a way to give free pack. But make it so that those cards in free pack cannot be traded. 

One more suggestion:
I'm a veteran card game (Especially for JP card). Hero cards don't need to have rarity. You should make all Hero viable at some point. Why do we play Dota? or Card game with beloved character?  Right?
+ At first I thought the three lanes were going to make it too complex, like playing three card games at once. But it only took me two games to get used to it and now I love the dynamics the three lanes create!
+ Also the deck building system is super smooth. Building a deck is very fun!
+ The card mechanics actually fit into the lore of the dota series. Blink dagger moves your characters to other lanes, Necro does slow but steady damage to units around him. It goes on, and gives dota players a feeling of nostalgia right out of the gate!
+ Very fun.
Best card game ever created. Very rewarding if you stop blaming RNG and start thinking out of the scope, no mindless droping minions on curve pushing face. Balance in ALL things. #LongHaulPlayer
pretty fun but pretty pay to win (as all card games) and needs some more balancing (at least from the beta)

at least there are modes where you can choose from all cards in the game

also there is no direct trading right now only steam market and it needs to be changed

will be the perfect mobile game i think
8/10

It's a really good CCG, nice gameplay with lots of strategic depth. Although the mechanics are very different (based on dota), It plays alot like Magic (but made for computers) as oppsoed to something like Hearth Stone.

Be aware that it is a CCG, so in order to be competative you have to buy card packs. I do not know what the future holds for this game, but there is ways to play with premade decks, draft and against bots, so if you just want to play casually without pouring money into it, you can.
Bought game.
Sold cards.
Made 41$.
Play free draft/featured free mode.
Still have 5 tickets. (To hopefully make more)
If your good enough you can essentially make free steam money.


This game is great exactly what the card gaming community needed. Is it perfect, no. But I really klike the steam integration with tournament features and everything. Very polished good job keep it up, reduce some rng elements a tad, and balance and it will be super duper.

$20 to buy the game

Draft as much as you want, forever, at no additional charge (ie FREE).  
This is the Premier Competitive Format, and it's a blast.

~$10 for a full pauper collection (commons only).  reddit.com/r/ArtifactPauper for regular pauper tournaments.
~$30 for a full silverblack collection (commons and uncommons).
~$200 for a full collection.  Much less for the competitive deck of your choice.

20 cards -> 1 ticket.  You might not be able to "go infinite", but you can keep the ball rolling with pocket change.


If you like online cardgames and aren't playing artifact, you are missing out.  This game is the best in its class.
So guys, here is the deal. Artifact is the best designed card game you can get on PC. Some randomization, just enough so that it still feels equal, but complex enough so that this game can only be easily played on digital form. The 3 lane system is just amazing, so that you can outsmart your opponent, or use your cunning to steal the games out of them. Best part, it always feel fair, unlike other card games. Also, you can play free draft mode FOREVER.

About the monetization: It's not as bad as people claim it is. You can make a competitive, high tier deck for as low as 2-3 $ (Less than the cost of 2 packs in other digital card games, and saves A LOT of time. In a certain card game, it may take me 1 month or more to make a new deck). If you value your time, this is the best system there is. If you exclude some overprized cards (Axe/Drow Ranger, Horn of the Alpha (which I feel that will lower in price soon)), I think you shouldn't need more than 100$ to have a full collection, and even less if you only buy the cards you need. 

This game however, currently misses 2-3 things:
Social aspect is horrible in game. Yes there are tournaments, but there is no way to gather people in-game to play them. Solution: Make your own communities out of game, which is a great band-aid fix but we need an official easier solution. 

The lack of in-game chat or even emotes can make this experience feel a bit lonely. An in-game chat and emotes have been teased in a trailer, but as of this review's writing (30/11/2018) is still-not in game.

There's no kind of progression currently. Honestly, the game is so good I don't mind, but some people actually do. Progression is promised later, most likely in the form of unlockable cosmetics.

All in all, I'd say give the game the chance it deserves. It is really the best digital card game offered in the market, and with the best monetization model, as long as you value your time as you do your money. The negative reviewers, are people spoiled from other card games' free to play experience (but actually p2w). Give Artifact some time. It is worth it.
The gameplay is deep, you have to use real strategy, and the RNG can be mitigated with proper thought and planning. But it can also be deeply frustrating getting fucked by a ridiculous card late game, but I suppose that comes with the territory of a competitive card game. With the recent updates, this game is definitely a must have. The hate it has been receiving has been from people too stupid to comprehend the pricing model and gameplay. I've spent MAYBE $25 on cards, and feel like I have everything I need to be competitive with anyone. It's infinitely cheaper and better than HS.
Game gets so much hate for its microtransactions but even if you don't want too spend much after the initial fee, you still get a lot out of it in draft mode and playing with friends.

Since I don't care too much about constructed mode. I sold the rares from the free packs of cards that came with the game and ended up getting my money back and more.


Used to hate card games until I tried this one.

People complaining about the economy are retarded, it's a Trading Card game, you know the ONE type of game "loot boxes" actually were intended for.
Don't get the hate - this game is very good and addictive.

You can easily beat most people with start deck, or at least spend 3 EUR and get all the most needed cards.

Great game. Reminiscent of magic the gathering, but a better digital product than mtgo. The economy is perfect for people who don't have the time to grind for packs and don't mind spending some money, similar to the mtgo economy.
This gameis amazing, by its depth, its visuals, its strategy. 
I really recommend this game to anyone bored by others TCG/CCG and who wants a fresh design and nice game.
There is a lot of lore background bound to DotA, nice dialogs betweens cards that offer deep knowledge of the universe.
And plenty more to come : social tools (chat and emotes), progression system, new modes and events, new cards (expansion) etc... This game has all the tools to become a reference and to live long !
And for the monetization system, complaints are really idiotics... It comes from people who never played at a TCG and that are bad faith saying HS is cheaper... You don't need all the card, just the card YOU need to play the deck you want. And you can just play draft... Doing 3 wins is quite easy with a bit of practice and then you can keep your tickets !

Just try it ! And you'll be hooked ;)
Great game that I have really enjoyed playing. I would ignore the monetisation reviews as it's not as bad as it's made out to be. The $20 gives you a lot of value, and paying more is a matter of choice
There are free game modes, one which doesn't even require you to have any cards.
I personally love the deck builder. It lets you build a deck even if you don't have the cards, which then you can later source for in the community market.
It's an amazing piece of design, but it's a shame that it really feels like you need to dump a lot of money in to be compeditive. I wish the pricing stucture was a bit fairer, I'm happy to pay but this really feels like a money sink. Especially when you buy a card back that is full of duplicates. 

But at the same time I can't stop playing
Great game and everything but constructed can be played without paying any additional money. There are free modes with precrafted decks, playing against a friend and a free arena mode(even hearthstone doesnt have a free arena mode). So there is plenty to do even without paying more. 
You want to play competitive constructed? Yes than you will have to pay more money but really only than.
Valve truely listens to player feedback and responds within weeks, while developer like Blizzard ignore the feedback for all eternity. Buy the game and support Valve, because they are truely dedicated to their player base!
Artifact is an intensly difficult card game that brings togeather everythingthing I love from Dota and MTG. Over time, with new expansions, I could see it becoming more complex then dota itself.
The value you actually get from the 20 euro is more than you get in any other card game. 

Since Heartstone got such a huge following, fans from HS came here and felt entitled to get free stuff in a card game. 

Hello? Ever played a card game before heartstone? Any cardgame besides heartstone have always been pay to play. 

Besides that fact, you will not get a competetive deck in heartstone without spending money og several hours grinding every day, and once you grinded enough the meta prob already changed and you have to get a new deck. Heartstone potrays itself as F2P but lets not lie, everybody who plays heartstone in ranked mode, spent money.

Infact Artifact is one of the cheaper card games because of the market system which allows you to buy specific cards you actually need and not rely on luck like in other games... heartstone..

I would dare to say that it's actually cheaper in Artifact to make a competetive deck than it is in Heartstone.
Also the 20euro you spent on the game actually gives you around I think 200+ cards which includes 10 packs you get for free that many people just sell to make their money back and play draft mode for free.

Other people who are great at draft plays expert phantom draft and make money through the free card packs you get by winning 4-5 in a phantom draft.

Complaining about the monetaization in Artifact is the worst complain I ever heard, fair enough if you wanna complain about other mechanics, but the monetaization is upfront and let you aquire what you need and not make you feel like it's free to play while you actually are spending more money in HS than you would in Artifact.
if you are bad at strategy or patience. dont buy this game. it requires alot of skills.
i bought this game, but did not buy even a single card and still managed to beat all the pay to win players. 
there is so much negative comment here because they lost the game and cried that they paid for it. so yea. if you lose alot, you complain it is bad. if you are smart and win alot. positive comments are coming. i din even spend a single cent on it except buying it. i dont even have the good cards. its just training and strategies
Big fan of hearthstone and other card games alike, would recommend to people willing to spend a few $$$ to play a few other decks but the game has a bigger emphasis on skill as it is VERY deep in terms of technique and skill.
The amount of bull***t you can experience in this game is insane. It's too much random no wonder the game is dead.

Now other than that, I think this is the best looking card game ever made  the game is beutiful. Esteticly they did a great job it just shows you how valve executes when they do relase a game. They aRe the best in class of cards games visualy at least. Artifact has a lot of depth and thats the good thing it's easy to get in to it but dificult to master.
It's not the problem with the game not being free to play I don't get why people are so upset with it when other companies are charging for their games too and no one is saying anything about that. Now gameplay wise one of the things that I experienced is when i make a decision in the game you can't know wether it was a good or bad decision at least early in the game and later on u understand that, that one thing u did lost u the game it's so unrewarding but if u put time into it maybe you can master it.
I thought I would write a review for this game because of my stance. I am against pay-to-win elements in game. I am a draft/arena type player. I was hesitant about buying Artifact because of the fact that it doesn't have in-game currency. However, after buying it, I want to clarify to SOME players sitting on the fence here like me. I don't feel like this is "pay to win" any moreso than any other card game. A bit of information about me

- Player of Hearthstone since the game was released.
- Picked up MTG: Arena.
- Dabbled around in some other card games.
- As of right now, I've spent £10 or so into this game and I've got what I need for the most part except for the top end premium cards like Axe, Drow Ranger, Annihilation and so on. Although, to be fair, I don't really play constructed.
- I've spent 4x that amount and much much more into other card games such as MTG Arena and HS. 

Most of the cards are fairly cheap. We're talking pennies here for most of them. Legionnaire considered an S tier Hero is about £.0.06 on the market. It's just the exceptionally top end ones which may cost a few £/$ such as Axe, who is £7-£8.

- You can recycle cards you don't want to draft an arena ticket. 20 for 1. Good for excess cards.

There seems to be levelling up rewards. Every 2 levels you get 2 free packs and 1-2 arena tickets. It will be hard to grind more than two levels in one week though, so it's capped.

There is a season ranking system as well, but I'm not sure what the rewards are for that as of yet. Both for constructed and draft.

As for the gameplay itself? I find it fun. I find myself playing even the free to play draft mode and enjoying it. The top end competitors such as MTG: Arena and HS don't offer free to play draft runs. So if you're a player that really enjoys arena/draft modes, you always have to pay for the privilige to do so. In this game, you don't need to invest a penny into draft mode if you don't want to. 

There is A LOT of RNG elements into this game. Where your arrows on your attackers point, to the creep spawns, which lane your heroes end up in against what other heroes and so on. That's without taking into consideration card effects. So if you're someone that cannot stand RNG, you might not enjoy this game.

So despite my hesitation to buying this game because of everything costing money, I recommend it. It's not as bad as it appears, seriously. If you're someone who casually just puts in money to other card games like HS/MTG, I say you get far more value here. You don't have to buy 82173837 packs to either get the card you want or enough resources to craft it. You just buy it from a reasonably priced market and skip all the hassle. There is SOME incentive for weekly rewards such as packs/tickets, and perhaps even the season may award some. Although I'm not sure if the levels reset at the end of a season as well as your season rank, otherwise the level rewards will be one time only.
I play only Expert Phantom Drafts. This is the best experience i had in card games!!

But they could add some small prize for 2-2 runs, so going infinity would be little easier.
2-2 feels like the 4th place just behind the podium. Give us 2 or 3 common cards, so recycling for tickets would be easier.

Hoping for your next good move.
Good luck Valve!
10/10, best card game, don't listen to the poor friends with Stockholm Syndrome who think grinding is good and who need progression to be incentivised to play games instead of just playing games because they have good gameplay
good game. Modes for the casual player so you can definitely drop 20 and expect to play for a long time without spending any money.

you can earn free cards, you just have to be insanely good. (win 5 games without losing twice)
tcg much cheaper compared to others but we shoudn't compare artifact to other games as we shouldn't compare ourselves to models. 

For a TCG, this is a very cost effective game. Yes, it has an initial fee of $20 as well as microtransactions. No, this is not a F2P game. You pay for your cards and tournament entry. That being said, this game has good value. The initial $20 buys you an equivalent amount of booster packs, so if you're gonna buy packs at all, you can disregard that initial purchase cost. If not, then Artifact offers free and unlimited Phantom Drafts, which is a pretty sweet deal if that's your thing. I haven't seen such a generous offer for drafts in other card games, and it's well worth the $20.

If you just want to play competitive constructed, individual cards are pretty reasonably priced in their marketplace, so you can skip the packs entirely, avoid gambling and/or dusting, and buy what you need for your collection. I see players spending hundreds all the time on MtG or Hearthstone, but Artifact card prices won't cost you an arm and a leg to get your ideal competitive deck. Last time someone ran the numbers, a complete playset of the game cost about $200, and a single deck would just be a fraction of that.

So, ignore the naysayers that wanted this to be a completely F2P game. This is not that, and never wanted to be that, but this IS a cost-effective digital TCG with some very unique components to it.

I'm not good enough at the game to leave a useful critique of the gameplay itself, so I'll just say I recommend this game on the merits of free Phantom Drafts alone. Worth $20 easily.
they have taken all the worst parts of a irl trading card game put it all together and created a game that skill only plays a part once you have the strongest op cards before that it is almost impossible to win enough to get more tickets or cards, this means the only way to effectivly play is to continuously pay into the game buy getting more card packs/tickets. dont get me wrong i do enojoy the game the card mechanics are good and the cards are brill but the balance in this game is non existant and buy adding the more expesive cards that you can only get through luck opening lots of packs or out right buying is the only way to counter the power unbalance i still would like to say if you have lots of money or you dont plan to play competitvely then get this game it is lots of fun but for people that want to play a game and move forward in it without needing to pay lots of their own money into it this game is not for you
I honestly love this game, but with start with the negatives: 

-Initial Entry Fee. Its a card game, people should be able to try it out for free 
-No real ranking system. So far there is not real ranked mode. No reason to try and improve yourself at the game
-Limited Card Base. This is just a problem with every TCG when they start, the meta is extemely limited for constructed. 
-No fun events, MTGA always has unique game modes, different kinds of drafts, etc going on. Events get people do build unique decks and more incentive to keep enjoying the game
-No rewards for playing. This is just standard with digital card games. Have some goals for people to achieve each week. 
-Marketplace is a roller coaster. In all honestly the marketplace is great, but with the state of the game its just a mess. You can keep the marketplace in the game and still have rewards for plays with free packs and quests. 

Now whats good with the game and its only one thing(and the kicker is, its probably the most important part): 

-The gameplay. This is the hot debate. Learning curve too high? Not accessible? IMO the game is amazing. When I was 7 years old I first started playing strategy games with starcraft(Idk why my dad let me play with him). Needless to say I've been on a 22 year ride ever since playing RTS, TCG, Turn based Strategy, type games. Basically I play anything that requires you to think a bit. I love puzzles, brain teasers, and competitive strategy. So maybe I am biased here cause of my but the gameplay really is great to me. Every move requiring me to think and plan my strategy. Thank you for this card game, for me at least. Just glad to know people are still making games like this, and not some loot based mindless grindfest everyone loves now.
Best card game on the market. Most games in draft go down to the wire and almost every game feels like it could've been won with a few better decisions in hindsight.
I've waited to review Artifact because I wanted to see the path Valve was going to take moving forward. A few weeks and two patches later I feel comfortable dropping a review. The changes being made are a blessing, and the game is incredibly fun. If you like card games then I certainly recommend checking it out. I've put in a lot of time with the game as you can see, and it's worth it.
Solid and addicting so far. Phantom draft is way more fun for me than constructed, but the tournaments with friends might change that. Sold all my cards from the 10 free packs and pretty much got my money back. I can definitely see myself spending a couple hundred hours "for free" here and decide if it's worth investing more.
Very fun strategy to the game but still enough fun to be had without spending more money, although spending more does get you the possiblility of playing more cards in the competatitve modes for rewards
This is a solid card game with a little daunting business model. But give it a try, it is worth the 20 bucks.
And if pricing is your issue, just sell all your cards you get from starter pack in the marketplace and play casual phantom drafts.
One of the most innovative and fun digital TCG experiences ever. The lane mechanics create a sort of mental tug-of-war where you try to predict and outplay your opponent's positioning. There are random elements, but aside from one major outlier *cough*Cheating Death*cough* games are typically decided by skill 

The price tag is controversial, but really it's not that bad. If you have spent money on another digital card game like Hearthstone or MTGA, you'll find that it is much less expensive to make complete meta decks. This is compounded by the fact that selling cards on the marketplace nets you 85% of the card's value compare this to the <25% return you get for dusting cards in Hearthstone.

Plus you can phantom draft all you want without having to spend any additional money.
If you want to build a constructed deck, this game is cheaper than any other digital card game. If you don't want to build a deck and you just want to draft, it is *completely* free once you own the game. Anyone who says otherwise is lying.

Draft is the premier game mode for Artifact, it's a lot of fun, it's what most people are playing. Can recommend.
Coming from constructed hearthstone player, I would say that this is a completely different experience from HS. Already tried the constructed wasn't impressed by it (probably because of my tiny collection). The draft on the other hand, I had so much fun playing it from the drafting process until the matchup eventhough I only got 3-2 on my first run. Would I leave hearthstone to play artifact? probably not. Because at the moment hearthstone's constructed is far better that artifact's. But I'd definitely play the phantom draft while building up my collection and give constructed another try. Recommendation for a new player from a new player, just play the casual phantom draft to get the feeling of the game then after you already build enough confidence get into the expert phantom draft or keeper draft. Good luck and have fun.
I studied this game since months before release. And I finally got to play after losing sleep about it. And YES, the game mechanically is amazing. Unfortunately launch was not great, people didn't feel there was much to achieve, and the poor balance of some cards threw people off since the expectation was to have the king of cards in eSports.
I'm still sure Valve will reach that point, but the road is very steep.
One thing I can safely say: don't be cheap and open your eyes. This game offers a great price for the entire collection. And if you are good you don't even need to buy packs.

Anyway, not a game for everyone as always with Valve. Learning curve is super steep, games unforgiving.
Let's hope boys.
Artifact is a good game. The mechanics are great. The visuals are great. The card interactions are great.

The only reason to not buy this game is because you don't want to play it, which is fine.

Have a nice day!
Two things I've seen that are incorrect in other posts.

1) "No way to earn cards for free" Yes there is, you start the game with 5 tickets which are used to play phantom draft. You can get tickets and packs from playing phantom draft. You can also use 3 tickets to play keeper draft, which competitors don't even offer. Not to mention the fact that you can use extra cards to craft tickets.

2) People like to use "Axe is $16" to complain about microtransactions but this is literally the most expensive card in the game, the next most expensive card is worth literally half that and it only goes down from there. There are Magic The Gathering cards worth more than 10x that much. 

Also the fact that you can directly buy cards rather than having to grind through packs is great, why are you complaining about that?

P.S. To summarize you can earn free cards if you are good at the game, so all this to say "git gud son".
Amazing game with minimized RNG and really, really deep in-game. On top of that you can buy most missing card sets from Steam Market for pennies, 

10/10 I do recommend.
Definitely a well polished game! 
I like the the fact its easier to collect cards compared to the money pit that is Hearthstone which I left solely based on that.
Bonus any cards you do have you can sell one day if you quit! :D 
Will admit I'd play more once the game expands with more Heroes and cards and play styles but that'll come in time
Few things about this game. I love this game. It's very very in depth fun and addicting game.

People talk about how the best cards are in high demand. Yes and no. It's the "cheese" cards are the most expensive. But I've made a blue deck that beats most green decks and I didn't spend anything more than 6 dollars. 

You can buy most cards and heroes for 30 cents. Aside minor complaints about being pay2play or whatever it's easily worth it. (when all card games Even real ones take money to play)
Got 11$ back by selling the contents of the 10 packs the game comes with. Won 4 packs in Phantom Draft and made four more Dollars by selling them. Show me a single F2P game with a grinding system that lets you make that much, that fast.

Calling this P2W is an absurd, its just salty people who can't afford 20 freaking Dollars.
Great foundation, a bit heavy on the RNG but it suits the game.
Still a lot of work to be done by Valve, i hope they can get the players back.

For me it needs a carrot to chase, not free packs per se but some kind of reward system to incentivise daily play.
having a ton of fun playing this.  having 3 lanes to manage is a really cool twist on a card game. as a dota player, i really enjoy the similarities overall.  well done!!
Nice game, a bit complicated at first...the payment system might not be popular but rly you are paying 10 cents for some rly useful cards, which i consider to be close to nothing. I don't see why paying a bit of money is considered so wrong
Great game, Great concept, Looks amazing. Just doesn't seem sustainable long term. There are more people playing KOTOR than this. Sold all my cards. May return some day but just can't play it in this state.
Amazingly fun design. Shows so much promise as a game. The fact that you can phantom draft with your friends for free, forever, easily makes the 20$ to pick this up worth it.
Don't listen to people who bought this game to "cash out". This game is extremely fun, so you'll get your twenty bucks worth entertainment easily — regardless of how the game will develop over the next months.

Previously I've never enjoyed the draft mode in TGCs, but here it's a lot of fun. It's true however that a ladder system is sorely missing. Players in 2018 want to see their progress in some way or another, so I hope that Valve will deliver here. Honestly, I think that they're just experimenting a lot and so rolling out the feature gradually in valve time, but we'll see.

For me, this is the better Dota, as it has all the complexity due the amount of heroes and abilities but without the moba gameplay. Also, you get to fight over three lanes without annoying teammates.
Not as pricey as people say when you compare it to every other card game on the market. Tier 1-2 decks are like 10-25$. I have spent 200$+ in other games to have 70% of a collection. Super fun and has a learning curve but what do you expect from a card game based off dota. Its 20$ and if you hate it you can always sell your cards for your steam cash back.
This game is simply briliant

The game design is spectaclular. 

With the leveling up system and the arena you can get new packs of cards for free and each has rare and ultra rare cards and hero cards so ignore all the old negative reviews about market and cards ...

It's best card game EVER
At the first contact, the game seems unhospitable for casual gamers and lacks of content & ladder for core gamers.

Let's be honest. It is clear that the game was made all about his monetization system taking all the place & speaks (all praise the true digital TCG) to squeeze lots of cash from Garfield's worshipers.

Despite those elements, the core gameplay and the extras gradually added after the chaotic release show that Valve is going in the right direction (even if it is kinda slowly - Valve Time).

Right now, if you are bad at card games like me but enjoy them, you can play free tourneys with more options with last patches (Chaos Blitz), free drafts and so on. Without paying, you have access to large sections of the game.

Artifact is a nice addition for the Dota's universe and will be a great showcase to sustain and expand Dota 2. Yeah, the beginnings stammered to profit of the blind trust of Richard's fans but now, Valve is taking the things over control.   That's why, "Still in it for the long haul".
[b]Is Artifact for you?[/b]

First of all ask yourself the question: do you prefer solvable card games despite their repetitiveness, being in control of every outcome, having a gameplan that you can see through to the end in every match? If so Artifact is [i]not[/i] for you.

Artifact is a game that is true to the nature of card games: it does not shy away from randomness. It is essentially glorified gambling (as is any such card game), but at the same time it is as far from gambling as a traditional card game can possibly be, boasting a very high skill ceiling and the most impactful gameplay choices that you will find in the genre. This is due to the innovative and completely original gameplay that it has to offer with 3 boards, cards that can only be played if you have a hero of the corresponding color and initiative (first say) which is a mechanic that forces you to make a choice [i]every[/i] turn in which you can play a card. Yes it has more random elements than other card games, but the most impactful one is still card draw. If you're not convinced of this fact yet, the highest win rate in prized constructed is ~78% for a large sample size.

[i]One of the things where Artifact differs greatly from traditional card games is the combat system. You don't get to decide which card battles which unless you have a card that lets you do so. This isn't as bad as it sounds because at high level combat is largely superfluous: you feel like you're doing something at first but as you gain experience it becomes highly mechanical and only a few combat choices actually feel like real choices. The trade off here is increased variance and focus on choices that affect the game at a deeper level than value trading.[/i]

Having said that, if you do enjoy unsolvable card games where variance plays an important role, you still need to ask yourself just how much effort you want to invest into learning the game and playing it.

Artifact can be counter-intuitive and demanding. You can't simply play out your cards and expect to win. There are important choices to be made every round: bad hero deployment and the loss of initiative can easily cost you the game. If you are looking for a card game where you can chill and expect your deck to carry you this is not the game for you. There are a lot of card games out there where netdecking and auto-piloting can get you most of the way to a win, but thats not Artifact. Expect fighting for your win, breathtakingly close games and lethal puzzles to be much more frequent than in other card games. 

[i]An example of counter-intuitive gameplay is letting a hero die so that you have it spawning on the right turn or deciding to not kill an opponent's hero if you don't want it to be alive at a certain turn.[/i]

Have I discouraged you? Well keep in mind that these very same arguments are going to have the opposite effect on the target audience for this game. But I have to warn you, Artifact is suffering from the lack of play modes and right now my most reliable source of enjoyment is playing in tournaments. The fact that there is no ladder and only loose MMR matchmaking keeps the more competitive players away from the current play modes that the game has to offer. The free modes suffer from the same issues which means the game is barely playable if you don't wish to engage into the competitive scene.

As far as gameplay is concerned Artifact is the best card game I have ever played, but I can't rate it 10/10 because it is an unfinished product, lacking features like replays, spectator mode and above all a free play mode with strict MMR matchmaking.

   Artifact, or the “DOTA card game”, tries somehow to transfer game concepts from DOTA to a card game. These concepts include:
- Buying items for your heroes during the match.
- The action takes place on 3 boards instead of one, luckily this proved to be less confusing than it first sounded.
-  There are “creeps”, which unfortunately spawn randomly on “lanes” in random positions, throwing more randomness in a game that is already very RNG heavy.
   The game length for a newbie like me was about 30min, longer than other CCGs. The game has no premium cards which would be usually animated versions of the standard ones.
   The game has lots of QoL improvements like you can see your opponents’ deck after the game, each deck has an identifier so you can quickly load/export decks, and the game lets you easily buy the cards that you are missing. You can freely sell and buy cards on the Steam marketplace but the fees for transactions are a bit too high.
   I don’t feel like the game has a purpose even though it has support for tournaments. The progression system was recently implemented and it’s very unimpressive. At the moment the player base is pretty thin.
   Artifact is not a bad game, it’s just pointless.


 Rating: Buy a rating from Steam marketplace for only $1.99.

People are outraged for no good reason. There's nothing predatory about the game because there's nothing that psychologically tries to get you to purchase the game, unlike f2p games. In terms of design it's probably the best from the card games I've played.
This game is extremely fun. TIghtly designed, interesting choices at every move, a play and response structure. MTG is great, but you want something different for a while, you know? Artifact is that different take on the same ideas, for me.

On monetization: it's designed to extract your money. But that's, you know, capitalism .. and I'm pretty sure most of you rail against progressive thought in any other context, so ... Fight the profit motive where it matters (health care! military industries! prisons! housing! corruption!) or get over yourselves. I payed $20, just do phantom drafts, and am having a great time.

Also, people don't understand the central limit theorem: here's a crude way of putting it - if you roll a lot of dice, it's a statistical game, not an RNG game. This is clearly a game of skill: and I enjoy the probabilistic thinking that die-roll mechanics encourage.

This review is selfish. Valve will be fine. I want this game to stay supported, because I love playing it, as a meaningless numerical distraction from the world
The game is great, and the $20 is actually a great value proposition. You can do casual phantom drafts for free (and the draft mode in this game is awesome), and it looks like they'll have a rotating selection of free events to participate in. If you ignore constructed and buy this game purely for free drafts and events, you can easily get $20 of value out of it. Plus, if you open your packs and sell the contents, you'll get at least $6 back in steam credit, which isn't half bad.
EDIT:
The most recent update allows for you to earn card packs without spending money. This was my major issue. The balance change also prevents some cards from staying over powered removing the most pay to win aspect. I would now recommend this game

ORIGINAL REVIEW: Fun game but the payment model is a scam. 20 for a starter deck and it is impossible to get new packs without spending money.
I really enjoy Artifact. I never really played online card games because I wasn't good at it but I have to admit that Artifact is a lot of fun. I'm looking forward to seeing the game be released on mobile!
I have only played a fraction of what I intend to - REALLY love this game. It gives you a feeling of discovering new thing and exploring new strategies that I think is amazing.

Such depth. Much fun. Very addicted.
(Was gifted this by friend for christmas).
Its a great Card Game with great depth and strategic possibilities. I dont mind the microtransacrion-system, as you can buy the one card you need on the market for pennies more often than not. Have fun!
I missed the old valve intro, other than that it's not really my type of game. It does look more interesting than hearthstone which I also played a bit.
Gonna keep this short and simple.
Idk how everyone is complaining about the paying for card system in this game. If you go play MTG or Pokemon or Yugioh or any other card game that isn't on your computer you will be buying packs of cards from target, walmart, etc so what is the big deal about paying litteraly $0.5 for a card here and you don't even have to worry about the RNG.
If you aren't some broke ass 11 year old you will enjoy this game if you have ANY sort of job that give you $5 extra a week to treat yourself to some cards. Otherwise stick to... whatever free card game you are playing?
P.S I've made a deck for $1.68 that has been giving me almost a 85% win ratio against all different kinds of decks (including "whale" decks that honestly aren't even worthy of the name whale since they are like $20 decks max).
An extremely fun concept. The gameplay is actually pretty good, and adds some nice RNG elements that require thoughtful strategy to react to the dice rolls that were given. Makes each game unique and different, and is kind of refreshing.

The playerbase is, as noted in most reviews, pretty lacking. This will probably be rectified with new card packs as they arrive in the future.

Like most card games, you buy a "starter pack" which is included with the base purchase of the game. You can unlock additional cards for free by leveling up, or by winning certain matches. Or you can buy them (like many other card games out there). If you don't have "good" cards, you can also play a mode called "draft", where you take random packs and make a deck for play from those cards. 

I've enjoyed the game so far, and it has been worth the purchase price. I dont think a free-to-play model would have worked personally.
I love this game. Contrary to all the garbage you will read on the bangwagon jumping reddits, i think this game is a standout title by Valve that differentiates itself from the rest, in a good way. I've tried HS, and the grind is annoying for me. i dont want to feel left behind if i dont do daily quests, so Artifact +1. I like the depth of the game, this one is totally undisputed amongst even the negative reviewers. the best part about the depth is that you feel every game's outcome could've been different if you did things differently, and each game is so close due to redeploy mechanics, even if you think RNG wasnt in your favour on the first turn. People say artifact is pay to win, but i've been having a blast just playing precontructed and casual phantom draft, which gives access to all cards and is all for free! i probably dont mind spending a few bucks now and again to maybe try out expert phantom draft or buy a few good uncommon cards, but i'm not in a hurry. People say artifact needs a progression system, and while i admit stats and a profile page would be a nice feature (which is coming soon this week anyway), but i pretty much enjoy learning the cards and the bluffs and the strategies and am mature enough to understand progression on my own without needing a colourful badge number to show. fully recommended!
This is a fun and very high skillcap game, that will challenge you to improve. If can be frustrating at times, but if you look back, you can always identify things you could have done better!
Artifact is great but keep in mind that this is not for everyone. This game wasn't necesseraly made for casuals but if you're looking for a competitive card game then artifact is your perfect choice.
This game is fantastic nuff said.

People complaining about the business model clearly don't think about how much other games cost your time. This game will not cost your time. If you want to play expert constructed modes you'll need to spend a couple bucks. If you just want to play the game there are several free modes. Expert drafting is pretty cheap and is the most fun I've had so far. Only costs a $1 entry, and once you get good enough you win it back more than half of your runs.

Seriously this is a great game. Buy it if you want to experience the best card game to date.
Guys who compare Artifact to Hearthstone and says that Artifact is boring did not learn how to play Artifact. Artifact is much more variate than Hearthstone and because of that, it is much more complicated. Just like in Dota 2 game: you may play 1 game for 40+ minutes tryharding really hard and thinking about a lot of things and no matter if you won or lost the game at the end - you'll get tired because of energy you spent on this 1 game. Hearthstone is more casual.
You need a lot of time to learn to play Artifact, as it has a lot of aspects, that you need to think about simultaneously.
And about pay to win. It was at the beginning, but now you have different ways to obtain tickets to play Draft mode (analog of Hearthstone's arena). And in some way, it's even better than in Hearthstone, because you don't need to play hours to farm gold to start new Arena (or just wait few days completing daily) as you can obtain tickets faster.

So if you want to decide to buy or not to buy then don't look at comments like 'pay to win' or 'boring', as authors did not understand the game. Only one thing that influences your decision - do you like more casual games or more complicated? If complicated - then choose to buy Artifact and give it a time to understand it. If casual - then don't buy, as you will give up and leave a similar negative comment as others.
Only few hours in, but I can already recommend this game to anyone who enjoys card games. Artifact has enough depth to satisfy advanced players, but it's still simple enough (after you learn the basics) to be enjoyable by more casual players.
I wish you could filter out reviewers who have less than 5 hours of play, it would change this game's review makeup immensely.

It's a great card game and I'm excited to see where it goes.
The game has a lot of potential. The latest patches did iron out much but there is still much room for improvement and I am sure Valve is already working on it - latest patching prooves it. The game itself is intense and fun. With the initial card packs, don't expect to do wonders again players that have already powerful decks. Be ready to invest additional $20 - $30 dollars for a few more competitive decks which isn't really bad considering that you get pretty competitive decks for not that much money. Valve should rethink and make the game f2p. Still I give it a thumbs up for deep tactical gameplay and great artwork and style.
Artifact is a very well designed card game, that is fun to play. The mechanics are for the most part pretty well balanced. There is depth to most decisions in the game, with strategic decisions in deck building, and tactical choices when using the cards. I was often thinking about the wrong choice I made, or my opponent did which cost the match.
Matches can be pretty long and typically end in nail-biting moments. While being a card game, it often feels akin to a board game when playing. 

The hot topic for this game is the cost. Honestly at $20 bucks, what I got was fine for me. However, I can understand some people's perspective. I have not invested additional money in this game, and have already had a more than reasonable return-of-investment in gameplay hours. It does seem like even Casual Constructed is difficult without re-investment. But Draft Play is where it is at for me, and there are no limits to deck experimentation in that mode. I have been nothing but impressed with this game for the most part.

This game would benefit massively from just a few tweaks; IMO.
1) Offer Free-To-Play Featured play against Bots and Friends.
	a) FTP version receive 5 Pre-Event Tickets. 
	b) Pre-Event - Grants Access to Casual Draft play
	c) Upgrade is same as $20 copy.

Larger Tweaks would be:
2) Story Campaign [Emotiooneer Level - **Ref: Tynan Sylvester]
	a) Comics are great. Barely anyone but die-hards will see them.
	b) Integrate them DIRECTLY into the game. 
	c) Use SFM to create Cut-Scene Story points for Campaign.

2) Engine Scaling for Cross-Play
	a) App/Mobiles: 
		- Minimal graphics
		- Basic card design using color blind  options
		- 52 Card style symbols, minimalize siloutte design

	b) PC Build:
		- Optimized, or more scalable
		- There are too many effects, niceities. 
 		- Dated PCs cannot run a card game? This should run on a Potato...
		- Implement minimalize siloutte design option for Potato CPUs...

	c) Virtual Reality:
		- Basic Design as is in current Engine
		- Player sits at the fire/stump depicted in comics

* The game currently is  something like 4.1 GB which is smaller then Fortnite on iOS

The artwork, music, and lore are awesome. The game is fun, and unfuriating. It always feels like every game is in my grasp. Then you get a bad draw, or the opponent gets the perfect card and sweeps you. I wouldn't buy all the hate for this game. I built two different decks with different strategies and I am having a blast. Didn't spend any money besides the initial $20. I am not even a Dota fan and I think it's a fun and great game.
The hate on this  game is crazy.  its easily the cheapest CCG on the market.  the ability to just buy the cards you want makes things so much easier and CHEAPER then buying backs, and dusting them.  

from a gameplay standpoint its also the best card game ive played. (and ive played most)  every game you feel like you win because of a decision you made, and you lost becaause of a decision you made.  its a great feeling.
I'm a fan of this game so far. I just wish they would of advertised their decision to base it on a physical card game price wise. a ton of people seemed to of not really checked out what this game is supposed to be before they purchased it. you WILL spend more money playing this game on top of the 20 dollars. THIS IS NOT A F2P MODEL this is trying to be a physical card game (while being digital). 

You can earn packs doing the expert ladders but other than that expect to spend 2 dollars per booster pack. In theory if you are either lucky or really skilled you CAN earn free boosters, but i wouldnt buy this if you cannot afford what a normal card game would be.

YOU ARE BUYING A STARTER PACK WHEN YOU BUY THE 20 DOLLAR BASE GAME. please dont write a review for pay2play this is selling just like if you bought magic the gathering or pokemon cards. 

If you dislike this ideal, this game may not be for you.
Loads game;
Wonders if this will be played more than a couple hours;
Plays 10 hours straight after buying it;
Fails University Exams, cause the day he bought this game;
Will prolly end up another year in Uni cause of this game...

But i opened 2 Axe's which is pretty nice, 10/10 would do it again

jesus christ the quantity of people downvoting because you have to buy booster packs like any other physical card game. yeah we got it, you are used to a system like Hearthstone, and what? At least this game tells you to pay, and its not even a lot, much better than wasting months for a f2p deck on Hearthstone. The costiest single card is a hero and he is $15, some people complained about this when any kind of card game i know has cards above $50 and generally you need to buy these cards more than once. There are too many people that are praying this shitty online card game system.. dont downvote for something that is your f*****g opinion, the game is "mixed" now just because of that. o my god
I think the game is fun, i played a few rounds and seems to enjoy it. I think the P2W is not there as its a real card game but virtual. The cards will become cheaper like in Magica and other RL card games.
Best game ever.
You know how all Valve multiplayer games are great except for the community being horribly toxit. Well, they finally created a  game where you don't have to interact with the community. No team, no in game chat, no idiot who picked huskar saying to report dazzle because he didn't get graved during global silence, just your cards against your opponent's. 10/10


Update:
On a more serious note, a lot of people are complaining about the monetization of this game and calling it pay to win. I've only played draft so maybe it feels that way in constructed, but draft is basically pay to lose. The competition in expert is way harder than the competition in casual. Besides, both casual and expert draft are tons of fun... usually.

My biggest complaint with this game is that it feels like there's significant autocorrelation in the cards you see in draft as well as in card draw during game. A few examples:

I've played 5 keeper drafts. In one of them, I opened two Chens. I took both of them and included them in my deck. Four of my six opponents during that keeper draft were also running Chen. My next keeper draft, I got another Chen. Chen is the only rare hero I've got from keeper draft.

I've drafted every Mist of Avernus I've seen because it's one of the most overpowered cards in the game. I haven't kept exact count but I think I've had it in about 8 decks out of maybe 80 that I've drafted. Two of those decks have had 2 mists and one has had 3. This was the 3 mist deck: https://www.playartifact.com/d/ADCJaQAYH2ALrwBBiEBuF1CJt0B1gUJB0kWlA6JTQcoAXsBFwgIEDMB. I think it was probably the best deck I've ever drafted. 3 mists and 5 thunderhide packs is pretty ridiculous. One of the games I played with this deck, I got the Unearthed Treasure out on mana turn four and got an extra card that turn and every turn thereafter. I didn't count how many extra cards I got from the Oxeman arena and other sources, but assuming it was 0, I drew 23 cards by mana turn 10.  I drew 0 of my 8 best cards (the mists and thunderhides) before mana turn ten that game. Assuming randomness, I should get about that lucky or that unlucky with card draw once every 3300 games. Odds of it coinciding with the best draft I've ever had should be like 1/250000.

I played against this deck in phantom draft: https://www.playartifact.com/d/ADCJfIAJbkCAZVZAi67AgEBBgFfAwsBGpABBAcTSQwFBQMGcwFOBwQGEFBb
12 rare main deck cards, 1 rare hero, 4 rare items. The item deck is pretty terrible, but mostly because it's missing the basics (traveler's cloaks) and includes one of the worst cards in the game (Jasper Daggers, which isn't rare). The only bad maindeck rare card it has is Keenfolk Gollum. I probably wouldn't pick Centaur before the final 6 cards in a draft, but I'd be more likely to do so early in a pack if he was going to be my third red hero, and I'd usually run him over Keefe. So all in all, I don't think it looks like this person went too far out of his or her way to draft rares, which means the odds of seeing a deck like this shouldn't be too different from the odds of opening 5 consecutive packs and happening to get 17 rare cards from those packs. I'm not actually sure whether that should be an underestimate or an overestimate since 15 of these 17 cards should often make it past the cut in draft, and there are a lot of rare cards that pretty much never should. (Whispers of Madness, Meepo, assured destruction, bitter enemies, fractured timelines, watchtower, path of anything other than the dreamer...).

Yes, I'm cherry picking examples so I should be finding extrema. However, I don't think I should be able to pick examples this extreme from the number of games I've played. I've played far more games of Dominion in my life than I have of artifact, and I've played only one game of Dominion that felt this extreme. A much higher percentage of the games of Artifact have felt improbable (including some where it felt like I got crazy lucky) than any other game I've played.

At least one of the following is true:
- My experience has been an anomoly, and more extreme than the typical experience.
- There is a bug in the randomization which causes autocorrelation in what cards you see when drafting and/or which cards you draw in game.
- There is a flaw in the game design which makes normal fluctuations in card draw feel significantly more extreme here than it does in other games.


Other randomness I'm not a fan of:
Bounty Hunter's random +4 can feel pretty bad, but more so if you are playing Bounty Hunter than if you are playing against it. At least in draft, Bounty Hunter seems pretty weak. I think Bounty Hunter would be a much better card both in terms of power level and in terms of game design if the random +4 was determined after the deployment phase instead of before the action phase. (Why? Black has a lot of cross lane damage, and bounty is terrible solo black. Whenever the +4 matters, every single health item can counter it, but few damage items can compensate for its absence.)

Not quite random but I absolutely hate At Any Costs. It either needs to be buffed by being made common and having pierce added to it so that it will do something to Red/Green and become a card that you actually ought to play around because you expect people to run it, or needs to be nurfed out of existence by having the deck lists made visible. As it stands, it's a mediocre card that isn't encountered often because it's rare and frequently shouldn't make the cut in a deck but is occassionally game-breaking when people run it if they happen to find a situation where it's useful.


On the other hand, I feel like a lot of the sources of randomness that people complain about don't detract from the game.

The arrows during deployment mostly extend the game since the curves typically favor whoever is losing the lane, and you have to play around not getting the curves anyways. Also, every color has several ways to change them.

I really haven't run into many reasons to complain about cheating death. It seldom makes it into one of my decks, and I am almost always playing at least a few cards that partially counter it (Prellex, Venomancer, Ignite, Conflagration, Dimensional Portal, and Defensive Bloom to name a few). It also helps balance the game, since it counters disgusting cards like Axe and annihilation. (Except it pairs well with annihilation too which sucks...)

Lucky or unlucky creep spawns definitely swing a few games, but in most games, enough heroes end up dying that creep spawns add more depth to the game by increasing the importance of decisions around deploying heroes, improvements, and cross-lane spells than they subtract by increasing randomness. 

I have mixed feelings about the flop but mostly think it's positive. It usually just increases the variation in game play, but there are a few heroes which amplify that randomness which can occassionally make the flop feel like it has too much impact on the game, especially Bristleback and Ursa. I'd like to see Ursa changed to have an active which gives him his passive (and then increases it) on a 3 or 4 turn cool down. Not sure about Bristle. Lycan/Enchantress is another really weird one where Lycan wins when they're offset and Enchantress wins when they're face to face. It doesn't impact the game much but can feel really bad. There are cards like Juke and New Orders which rectify these situations, but only if you draw them early, which goes back to card draw feeling like the primary source of randomness in this game that really detracts.


Honestly, I think this would be a signifcantly better game if card draw was changed to be something like the follwoing: pick two cards that you start with, build two decks with at least 19 cards each. At the start of each turn draw one card from each deck. The first extra card you draw is randomly picked from either deck. After that, extra card draw alternates between the two decks. At least for draft.

Updated score: 8/10.
I love Artifact. Yes, even now I'm still playing and enjoying it. The issues with the game are all (in my opinion) solvable with time. While I understand that most people aren't patient enough to wait for things to get sorted out, I'm still actually enjoying the game and that is enough for me.
Haven't played much yet, lul

-------------------Pro--------------------
- Monetization, well done. Thanks to the Community-Market this is the best model for digital TCG.
---> You can actually play constructed in this game without grinding your life away or throwing away hundreds of dollars every few months to stay competetive (Hi B****ard)
---> strong decks for a few dollars (cheap cheap)
---> The cards you own hold value (A couple dollars spend for a deck doesn't mean that money is gone)
- well thought through menu, all necesarry filters in constructed etc.
- good looks in general
- deep and complex gameplay

----------------Contra--------------
- deep and complex gameplay
---> mb too overwhelming for casuals in the beginning (probably why it's not doing so well , yet)
- "shop" phase seems to be too luck based (my noobish intuition)
-  confusing between phases (lanes act at the same time)
- too much stuff to keep track off (3 Lanes, Hero buffs and spells, Hero [and their buffs] redeployments etc. etc.)


Not much time to play atm, but i can't wait to dig into it more.
Loving the look and strategic possibilities so far ,I'm very excited.

I'm rolling my eyes at the pay to win critics,probably the same lot who thought it was a heartstone clone (facepalm) ,I'm pretty sure it was advertised like a real life ccg.Economy and everything.

Im going to play and try to win with the hand I was dealt with the initial ten packs,as such is life.
(play the hand you're dealt)
Maybe reward my self with an extra pack here and there when I've earned it.
Why would you want all the cards anyway in a competitive game?
Everyone would know what to expect and it would take away that feeling of lucky math when opening packs.

One issue ,I'm getting a 16x9 screen resolution notification issue even though my screen is 16:9,also the shop (view board)button is blocking the middle of my secret shop buy button so I cannot buy from the middle slot,I am not sure if they are related.

(not geting frustrated,staying patient)
(I have now fixed this,it was my resolution,working fantastically)
I've played MTG for over two decades, so I guess I honestly don't understand the extremely negative reactions some people are having regarding purchasing booster packs, it seems in line or cheaper than most other CCGs (MTG, Hearthstone, etc.).  I haven't purchased any booster packs so far (just stayed with the initial packs that were provided), and I've been having an absolute blast.  There's a draft mode too, which doesn't require ANY purchases whatsoever.

If you loved Hearthstone and/or MTG, then you gotta check out Artifact.  In my humble opinion this will be *the* defacto CCG for the next several years, and hopefully beyond.  The strategy and depth of the game is really incredible.  I stopped playing MTG a couple years ago - mostly due to cost to stay competitive in Standard, so I've been dying to find something new with the richness and depth that Magic has offered me over the years.
CS:GO = best competitive FPS
DOTA2 = best competitive MOBA
Artifact = best competitive TCG

Valve delivered some great singleplayer games in the past, now they're ruling over 3 popular multiplayer genres at the same time.

If you're looking for a casual card game to mindlessly play while on your phone, stick to Hearthstone. 
For everything else, Artifact is going to be the best choice. 

If you're still playing Gwent, MTGA or one of the many less popular alternatives you're doing something wrong.
Artifact is only in set 1, which mostly consists of rather basic and unspecular cards, yet it's already more fun, diverse and skill rewarding than its competitors.
I wasn't sure if I'd like this as I don't play a ton of card games (played a bit years ago)

Found this to be enjoyable.
There is a complaint that this game has microtransactions, or that it's "pay to win"
The $20 for the game is actually the value of the 10 card packs you get upon logging in. Normal card games have booster packs that cost real money too so it's no surprise to me that this virtual card game does the same. 

For anyone who has played IRL TCG/CCG games like Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, or Pokemon for example, then you will enjoy this game. If you are light-hearted towards microtransactions and the idea of "pay-to-win" then you should probably spend $20 elsewhere. 

Is the game "pay-to-win"? Is it heavily influenced by microtransactions? Well, yeah. It's a collectable/trading card game. EVERY card game with this format is pay-to-win (Except Hearthstone, but even then you'll be grinding for MONTHS just to get a competitive deck if you don't want to spend money). If we take Magic: The Gathering for example, a competitive modern deck can range from 300 - 500 dollars. But you don't HAVE to spend that much to make a deck. You can easily build a pretty good deck for 30 dollars. But it won't be good enough to compete against top tier decks. For Artifact, it's similar. BUT highly competitive decks in this game range from only 20-40 dollars, which is very generous compared to other card games. 

The other complaint I see is, "Why do I have to spend $20 on a game that I have to pay MORE money for just to play competitively?" For starters, that $20 gives you 5 booster packs and 2 starting decks. Imagine that $20 as a beginner box for Yu-Gi-Oh or Pokemon. It's solely there to teach you the game and give good cards to make those starter decks better. And considering what you get in those packs, you can sell a few and make a REALLY good deck. It's fair that they would charge for the game. Because if they didn't, the economy of cards would be fluctuating a lot more and highly competitive decks would be way more common. 

Enough about complaints, here's what I think about the game. 

Compared to other card games, this one is probably the most unique and fun one I have played. The only downside is that sometimes, or rarely, you will lose a game soley on RNG. No, I'm not talking about randomly drawing into a bad card, I'm talking about actual game mechanics. On turn one, if your heros are randomly placed in bad spots and 2 or all of them die on turn one, you basically lost. It gives the opposing player more money, more card advantage, and overall control for the rest of the game. So if you're not playing some sort of BR control, you're boned if this happens to you. Another downside is that the game lacks enough cards to see a wide variety of different decks. In competitive play, everyone is playing the same 3-5 decks. But over time this will be changed with new sets that'll be added. 
But besides those, the game is REALLY fun. Even though most competitive players use the same 3-5 decks, the RNG mechanic can make each time playing those decks interesting. Which gives the player more of a challenege. 
Artifact doesn't solely rely on how good your deck is, it's how you play it. 
Currently a 8.5/10. Could be a 9/10 if we see more content being created for the game.
Does it have every feature under the sun? No. Is the core gameplay amazing? Absolutely yes. 

For a base launch game Artifact is amazing and with proper support from Valve will grow into a proper game. Looking forward to future expansions and whatever else Valve has planned for the call to arm like events.

Oh, and the imps are fantastic. Cosmetics when?
So far this game has been amazing. The built in tournament features and ability to spectate is a dream come true for a game that was just released. Obviously there's always a few things that need tweaking, but overall, it's a great game.
Solid card game gameplay. Drafts are fun, constructed is fun. Loads of meaningful choices, adaptation is key.

I'd prefer a more dota2-esque monetization model, but the game is good enough for me to ignore that.
Aot of people are hating on this game, and yes the pay structure is not ideal, but the gameplay is amazing. Nobody is playing this game, everybody is shitting on it but i cant stop coming back for more. Its $20, you get cards/packs with entry and by the time you get the hang of the game you will have earned even more packs and tickets. I guarantee you will spend twice as much making competitive decks in a new hearthstone expansion. Hopefully this game goes f2p soon, but the gameplay is currently great.
Incredibly fun, wow. This is by far my favorite card/board game. Battles incite thrill, leaving no room for displeasure. The skill ceiling is very high, and I like that in a competitive game. It's a thrill to play, and I know that it will never feel stale to me.

There are a bunch of Free2Play game modes. There are a few Pay2Win* game modes. Cards are well priced, and if a card is about to drop in price you can sell it for it's original price before it actually drops in price.

*Less pay to win than every other similar card game that I know of.
I have been playing the call to arms constructed decks (to learn which type of cards you like) and have been having a blast. I do not understand why everyone thinks you HAVE to put money into this game. You do NOT have to play the expert mode that requires event tickets and in some modes packs. You can play the casual line forever on the cards that come with the game. 

I have played so many games from Star Wars Galaxies (Greatest PVP) to Rim World and everything inbetween. This game has some of the greatest pvp. I have lost by just one point and won by just one point. I have thought I got this 100% there is nothing they can do, and they pull out some miracle. The game goes on for another round maybe two... it is just amazing how you just do not know if you will win until you get the victory screen. You can't make mistakes but you will know when you do.

I am really enjoying this game and wish people would try other modes that do not require packs or events before saying it is P2W. I have yet to put in any money into this game and I was planning on buying some packs / event tickets but I have been enjoying the casual modes that I just do not need to. I know as long as I do not do expert mode I'll be able to play for as long as I like. Expert mode requires tickets and sometimes packs.

The competition so far is fierce and the gameplay amazing. Try it out and stop listening to these people that are upset just because they are jumping into expert before trying the game out.
Ignore the haters. Here is one the deepest most complex card games made. Free Draft. Free Tournaments. You'll easily get your inital purchase price back in game time, and if you enjoy it, treat yourself to a deck or some cards. Much better than all the other CCG's out there.
A lot of the hate is from people who aren't the best; and find the game too confusing to otherwise take the time to learn. The gameplay is extremely thought provoking. One of the only card games so crazy it's almost a competitive puzzle peicing.
 The overall aesthetic is INCREDIBLE. I hope they implement some way to change the board, or maybe change the lil courier creature.
 The MMR system is fair. I went from STOMPING people with any deck I made off the top of my head, to playing people I can't even read their names and I STILL win fairly consistently(3 out of 5 games). 
Money although an issue, isn't THAT big of a deal. It's more the tickets I find a fault in rather than the card packs themselves
I want to add that I really hope Valve does more with this game.
This game is not pay to win...lol. You can buy every card i the game for about $25-30 bucks. no other card game can you complete any collection for under $100 or 200... The game itself is lacking a  clear ranked platform as of now. This game will be shutdown by kids that dont understand the mechanics of the three lanes. As with everything else in the world today if you dont understand it...burn it to the ground...
Very fun and strategic. I don't mind the monetization system whatsoever. Much cheaper than Magic The Gathering, but better and more fun! It's also super convenient compared to physical card games, because you don't have to wait for shipping, or worry about cards being damaged, so you can just focus on strategy.

The initiative system is awesome, and I love how it captures the macro strategy of MOBAs.
This game is complex and exciting. Valve has done so many things right in this card game. From the lore and full voice acting to the thought provoking gameplay. To people who want to play the most competitve card game, look no further. However for everything they got right it feels like they dropped the ball on basic features to draw in a wider audiance. You can argue they did this on purpose but still. A game releasing in 2018 with no progression, social features, or basic stats is not a good decision. All in all I'll be spending a lot of time with this game and I'm very much enjoying it.
Really great game !!!! Solid 12 / 10 

Gameplay : 

I'm coming from another big card game, and there is no match, Artifact got better graphics, better gameplay, better interaction, smarter cards,  better in a loooooot of way ( at least for my personal opinion) and you feel really hyped when you win or steal a game, get a lethal isnt as easy as it sometime feels !!

Economy :  

Sooooo here is the controversional topic..  But why ??

You got an ammount of packs and " tickets " when you got the game ( worth 18€ as the game i think ), the remananant draft everyone one talks about costs tickets AND booster, but you chose and keep the cards, so kinda worth ( especially if you win your games !! Depend on your result you will win some packs + tickets !! ) 
There is at least 6 queue divided between 2 major queues : casu & expert.

ALL CASU QUEUES ARE FREEEEEE : So you can open your openning packs, play a lot for training and when you feel ready go to the expert queue !!

Expert queues : Except the remanant draft, the 2 queues remaning costs 1 tickets each, and you can win a total of : 1 tickets and 2 boosters if you manage to win 5 game, with only one  loss. 

So casu player : almost free game, Try harder player : know to be good, or learn to pay
“Sometimes the backlash comes from people who are genuinely, if wrongly, fearful of change." 
-Barack Obama

This game is deep, strategic, complex, and unique but is not being recognized for it due to the backlash against a model that is against the current CCG status quo. I believe in the future this game will be recognized for the masterpiece that it is. Vincent Van Gogh died a poor man. If I'm wrong and it isn't, it's your loss.
This is an amzaing and in depth Trading card game.  I don't really understand the anger behind the microtransaactions.  It is an important part of a TCG.  Your collection has real world value, you are building something that has, in a sense, digital substance.  

As for the initial $20 it is well worth it.  With the 2 constructed decks and 10 packs you can have fun playing and learning the mechanics of the game in a casual constructed format.  The phantom drafts are another amazing play mode which imo, drafting is the most fun way to play a tcg and you get unlimited practice and fun with the initial purchase.  The featured gauntlet as well is a ton of fun with the pre constructed decks and again is a great way to learn playstyles, color personalities and diffrent types of combos.  

This is a fantastic and complex game that I am really happy I got in on at ground zero and am looking forward to years of fun and challange.

Also, people saying the full collection is $300+.......why, why do you need every single card?  I played MTG semi competitive and been playing since '98 and I do not own every card.  You don't need a whole set.  You play draft and build one or two constructed decks you enjoy playing and boom.  Countless hours of fun.  This is not a CCG it is a TCG.  There is a difference.  

I'm a huge fan of tcg and played lots of them both online and irl, and artifact has the worst economy system among all the tcg I played. The tax for trading is ridiculously high (15%!) and the only product available are packs, no prebuilt decks no promos etc.

This game is impressively fun to play, but every other aspect sucks.



Nice update valve! That's the attidude
Ok , The first time i played Artifact i thought it was kinda boring. But after thrying to refund it and bieng denied i decided to give it another chance. and upon playing it again i found genuine fun!!
To all those who say "this game is a lazy terrible cashgrab"  Are wrong. the few games i played brought me joy , pain ,and fun.  If you enjoy Tough strategy games you will like Artifact.  If you dont enjoy tough strategy games you will not like Artifact. In Short if you like tough strategy games you will love Artifact, And with the new update you can now earn cards by just playing!
I Personally love this game! And you Will Too!!

//   I think this is the beginning of something good for valve   // 

--Half Life 3 confirmed????--
Personally, I think its fantastic. I accept complaints about the monetisation but I think the core gameplay is rewarding, though the learning curve is steep. Once you get a handle on the initiative system and the combat mechanics it begins to make a lot of sense and, at least in my case, my win rate spiked very quickly. I highly recommend the game but with the caveat that you should do your due dilligence before buying.
Great game!  Don't listen to the haters, overall, the economy is much better than other f2p games.  You just need to invest a little up front but in the long run its much better!
People keep complaining about the price, but you can literally play draft for free indefinitely.

If you want to play constructed you can buy single cards instead of opening packs constantly, hoping for 1 card in particular and even arguing that the cards are too pricy, you can always buy them, play with them and if you get bored/you don't like the card you bought you can always sell it back. Same goes if you want to buy an entire deck.

You can play a casual constructed for free (with the only cost being what kind of deck you want to build), the only real difference with expert constructed is that you pay a fee for entering and  you get rewards for good runs.

The game itself is fun and challenging, with some amount of RNG to create unique situations and board states and some evergreen mechanics from other card games.
Once you pick up the basics the game becomes much more understandable altogether.

The only real criticism I can give is the fact that this game is missing some kind of ladder system or at least, some tangible way to tell you how well you're doing outside the gauntlet runs, but if i recall correctly Valve already mentioned working on it post-release.
Note that most negative reviews against Artifact are fairly insubstantial in addressing the game or its mechanics.

This is an excellent game if you're willing to take the time to learn it. There is a lot of complexity involved, and the randomness on top of that has obviously made this game impenetrable to 70+% of people. That's pretty clear. For the same reason, not everyone enjoys chess - at least not enough for most people to make a hobby out of it. But that doesn't mean there's anything bad about the game of chess. I've enjoyed playing a lot of chess, and it's quite rewarding to learn its underlying elements and principles. For me, the principles of chess could be applied to real life.
 
In the same vein, Artifact is a fun game to try master. With all the complexity, there are many potential strategies to follow. And the game's artwork, music, and spammable voice-lines for each hero are definitely a treat.

But the randomness can feel unforgiving. Some losses can feel utterly impossible to have defeated no matter what -- but at the end of the game, there is almost always a decision or strategy that could have been improved, playing a hero to a different lane, or playing a card early instead of saving it (or vice versa). It takes a certain personality type to think about games this way, to reflect, evaluate, and persist to improve. For me, Artifact has been very fun in this regard.

I've mostly enjoyed playing the featured event (Call to Arms), because each deck is known and set, so it's easier to learn each of their strategies. Random mode has been my go-to, and it's honestly fun to identify the elements that make up a "solution" for each battle. If that sounds like something you'll enjoy, then give it a try.
The game is fun and good looking, but need more 'free way' to get a card. At last add some free drops like dota 2 did. Oh ya almost forgot, please add progression to this game. And gratz for the launch.
if you get over the fact that the monetization is very traditional, you have a unique collectible card game with a depth of play similar to Magic: The Gathering. Rounds can be pretty long and intense. There is the advantage of having no mana screw but you have to deal with another kind of randomization in terms of unit placement. This is something very difficult to grasp, since two turns ahead you don't know for sure if a lane is secure or not. 
I have fun with the game mechanics and for it's first card set, the decks are pretty diverse. There are combo, control and aggro decks and because of the systems in place it allows for more unique card designs to come. This, in my opinion, is the biggest plus; It tries to alleviate the biggest weaknesses in MTG and sets a ground for a freedom of choice which only a select few of (strategy) card game have.
My first 30 minutes in artifact goes like this

-buys the game for 18€
-read reviews after I bought it because Im smart
-sees that it is pay to win
-plays it anyways
-complete the tutorial
-game seems fun
-gets 10 free card packs for completing the game
-opens card packs
-gets 3 of the most expensive cards
-sells the cards 
-made my money back

10/10 free game
Edit: Game's still awesome and the devs have fixed the majority of the issues everyone was shitting the bed about, surprise surprise.


Artifact finally brings the best parts of MTG to the digital world in a way wizard's never managed to do, while abandoning some of the worst parts of that game in the translation, along with some really novel innovations as well.

The monetization scheme is extremely generous compared to almost every other title on the market, don't let the liars in the review section trick you. Compared to games like hearthstone that require months of grinding or hundreds of dollars for a single deck, you can pick up a top competitive deck for  10-20$ dollars easily.

Really, this is the DCG I've been waiting for since 2008, it's friggen fantastic.

Huge depth of gameplay, great support for playing with friends and outside communities, much more friendly price tag than any other game like it. 10/10
I think its hard to deny it's a well done game. Games this deep and interesting are rare these days so I believe the money is worth it. What I personally don't get is, a mass majority of people will pay for a 20 dollars for a fortnite skin they use for a week or two because it looks "cool" where 20 bucks in this game gets you 120 well done and interesting cards. Seems worth it to me.
I was a hater... Then I played for two days straight, spent an extra 10 dollars, got an Axe and a few other rares, sold them for about $25, got a decent deck together and am now winning a little more than half of my games. 

What makes it really special are all the game modes - tons of them. Lot's of casual and offline options. 

Playing against the AI in offline mode was incredible for helping me get a good deck together that won me a few tickets and a card pack in the expert mode. 

Just keep playing the AI with different deck configurations; after winning a few matches in a row, take it into casual play; after winning there a few times, try a guantlet. 

All in all, I'm having a great time. Good job, Valve!
This game is an absolute masterpiece. I had high expectations for Artifact, but I was afraid that it may be too similar to other CCGs and trading card games that I had played before. The game is able to stand on it's own and provide fantastic depth and complexity.

Here are some of my big takeaways:

-The user interface is extremely polished.
-The voice acting and artstyle are great and fit the tone/gameplay perfectly.
-The game has a lot of great flavor and strategy.
-You are able to trade unwanted cards on the Steam Marketplace for for $$, which is a serious advantage compared to other digital card games.
-The game is fun and varied with a LOT of replayability.


If you are a fan of games like Magic: the Gathering or other traditional card games, then you owe it to yourself to give this a shot. For $20, you get at least 5 phantom drafts, multiple decks to play to try/customize, and 10 booster packs. I really think Valve has crafted an excellent card game and I can't wait for further expansions/cards to expand upon this fantastic base.
I like the game better than hearthstone. I like being able to get cards directly rather than randomly. There's less random effects than hearthstone. This is a good game.
Games great. its supposed to emulate tabletop TCG's such as Magic and Yu-Gi-Oh and it does a fantastic job. I love TCG's and this is the first time a digital card game has actually managed to be good. Ignore the bad reviews they are just people who don't understand what this game is trying to do and the identity it is trying to be and if they got the game full well knowing what the game was trying to be, then they are idiots and you shouldn't listen to them anyway.

TLDR: Do buy game if: you like physical TCG's like tabletop MTG/yugioh/pokemon.
Do NOT buy the game if: you want this game to be like hearthstone or other digital card games where it gives you anything for free and its casual.

This game is not meant to be taken casually, the entire PURPOSE of the game is the competative side/nature to card games.
Excellent game. Don't understand the hate for the $ model. You can play several ways for free using pre-constructed decks and draft. If you want to purchase cards they are reasonably priced in the shop and you don't have to hope you get what you want by opening countless packs with random stuff in them. I wanted 3 heroes and 14 cards to complete a deck and it cost a whole $2 - compared to hearthstone where that gets me two packs of random cards.
Artifact offers something to fans of TCGs that hasn’t really been offered before – and that’s a format that makes complete use of the digital environment it’s set within. When I first heard about the three lane structure, I was incredibly skeptical, thinking it would be a convoluted mess that would be challenging to track and potentially feel ‘tacky’.

I’m happy to say I was very wrong. 

Artifact is a unique and engaging experience with a plethora of layers, where below I highlight some of the key features that I feel make Artifact a fantastic experience. 


Win Condition Diversity – This is a huge one, since many card games can often feel ‘linear’ in how you approach a win. With one life total to gun down, games can often be about overloading decks with burn spells and fat creatures – don’t get me started on OTKO combo decks. However, with THREE lanes to manage, while there still will be cards that are more successful that others, (thanks Axe, honorary mentions Drow) there’s room for a variety of other strategies to thrive. The reason for this is player decision making is a HUGE element of Artifact (but I’ll get into that later), where it’s not just about the resources you have, it's what your opponent is doing and 'where'. You may dominate one lane while your opponent wrecks another, do you defend the lane their dominating, or try contest the third lane further? I really noticed this when I was playing a ramp deck – “yep, I can ramp, but which lane?” Having to win three lanes with the same resources creates lots of opportunities to pressure an opponent – and doing it well is an art that is vital to winning. 

Then there’s gold vs mana ramp. Absolute genius design. You may choose to go for big spells, but your opponent may go for big items. This results in interesting matches where both players are making big game swinging plays that rely on entirely different resource pools. It actually made me think of board games like Catan – where players can build towards particular win conditions without worrying about others. While features like this are present in other games, it feels particularly pronounced by Artifact’s lane and item systems – do you all in one lane, or try to take down two, and if so, how? Overall there’s already a plethora of opportunities for interesting strategy and game design, and I look forward to seeing how Artifact continues to develop this. 


Player Agency – I can’t talk about how much I love the initiative system. Yes, you could use that card to overkill this lane, but what happens next lane? The constant too and fro of “do I want the last word” creates exhilarating interplay between players. 

To explain initiative, basically, the last person who played a card in the prior lane, gets to play first in the next lane. This results in extremely potent mind games. There will be times when you NEED to go first in an upcoming lane, and thus have to play around whether your opponent will make another move. If you play a card and they pass, you may be screwed of a game winning play in the next lane. 

Also, many players will rejoice that ‘counter spells’ don’t currently exist – as anyone who’s ever played Magic the Gathering (or Arena for that matter) will know the pain of practically playing Solitaire vs a full on control deck. ‘Lock’ is a great substitute that creates proactive gameplay while still giving control players hand manipulation toys – the player can’t play the card, but they can navigate the situation that is creating the card lock. While control can still be frustrating (it always is), Artifact still has ways players can sneak a win or turn a table. 

The Market and Economy – Time for controversy but I’m a realist, being able to point and click on a card and say ‘purchase’ in a digital economy is so refreshing. In Hearthstone you need to choose one of two pain points – sink 100 or so dollars into the game, or say goodbye to your free time. With Artifact, you don’t have to buy on bulk to literally obtain in game currency that lets you put something together, you point and click. Thus, while it may be expensive to get a whole collection, getting a functional deck that is fun is actually (comparatively) quite cheap. Most meta decks would set you back 30-50 dollars, and that’s only if you choose to use the most powerful chase cards. The pauper deck community in Artifact in thriving, with a variety of accessible decks already on many websites. Artifact Fire also has average deck compositions containing more commons or uncommon cards on average – and a large number of common and uncommon heroes see lots of play in a variety of decks. 

I also think it’s important to mention that extremely skilled players can literally make steam credit off artifact. Constantly winning your event ticket gauntlets with your constructed deck? Pull Axe? Profit. While this won’t be everyone, it stands as a very reasonable justification for the design choices Valve made with the economy – where I see having a very open card economy as worth sacrificing potential free packs and content. 

Phantom Casual drafting is also a major draw, where being able to freely practice drafts without having to pay money just for fun means people who have had less exposure to the format can actually give it a go without fear of being stomped with actual stakes. 


The Cards Are Exciting – Final point, and possibly the most important to end on, the cards are just good old fashion fun. Yes there are going to be your typical ‘this is a big body’ cards or pure stat value cards (hello again Axe), but so many cards have interesting, dynamic, or unique elements. Meepo is a fantastic example, with his poof ability being a challenging but extremely amusing mechanic that can be abused in a variety of ways. Many cards such as ‘gank’, ‘relentless pursuit’ and ‘blink dagger’ also exploit the lanes system, and it’s always satisfying to watch as players scramble to reposition cards between lanes to pull of complicated or engaging plays. In many card games, it can be frustrated when your opponent is playing well, but I’ve found myself more amused or interested in what my opponent is doing – because the way the cards work is in itself fun. 

Overall, I highly recommend giving Artifact a go to any TCG player (as well as anyone interested in the genre), as it provides a breath of fresh air to the genre. The strategic diversity, embedded attitude towards proactive gameplay, and plethora of unique and interesting cards make for a card game that pushes players to go beyond convention and explore – where I personally look forward to seeing how the game grows and continues to exploit it’s unique design and mechanics in future expansions.
Poor third worlders and 1 dumb american who live their lives surrounded by dirt and flies seem to be trashing this game because they don't have 78 cents to complete a deck, don't listen to them this game is great.
best game ever. transaction system is the best. you can spend a specific amount of money and you know exactly which cards you get. and you can sell your cards. this is a great game 10/10
I do recommend this game for ever card game enthusiast. It is the most unique game out there...

After spent years playing card games this one instantly gripped me and struck by its depth and nuance. (disclaimer not all of them but most prominent ones)

At first glance it seems like the game is quite simple and yet once you do a single game with real opponent it is obvious that there is an enumerable number of ways you can approach a single strategy.

The one most important difference that opponents play cards one by one, always presenting an opportunity to react to a move.
Another is that combat phase happens only after all the back and forth during the action phase resulting in an interesting mind games and wiggling your way into a dominant position, ready to deal as much damage while taking as little as possible in return.
There is an incredible depth in terms of overal strategy with lane switching and intricacies of hero abilities and combos that you can do.

In terms of getting your decks I can't say too much right now. However what I got now is 20 packs (10 from initial purchase and another 10 on top of that). There is definately things I wish I had but even now am able to put together a decent (albeit not with full play sets all over) deck.

One interesting thing to note about item cards is that there is a 'secret shop' mechanics in the game which randomly gives you an item and you do not need to own that card for it to appear in a game which I thought was quite interesting.

And also you don't have to grind for your collection anymore, just open the market and buy singles just like in cardboard MTG. This is perfect.
For all the reviews complaining about Pay to win..
If you're considering playing any real card game, expect to invest money into playing the game.
A good example is Pokemon, MTG, etc.. the real card games.
This is a great game, nonetheless.
Loved the way they brought the Dota mechanics to this TCG. Please don't give the cards for free and make people work for it.. It'll pay in the long run if you make sure the content is properly maintained.
Overly convuluted, but enjoyable.  Addictive, even thought the cash shop seems to be the only way to get more cards.  My 10 included packs had quite a few great cards.
I don't know how to describe my feeling,there is no doubt that this is a good game.It has good game interface,complex and interesting mechanism and so on.But,I really don't play.Maybe because without rank,
It is a good game so far the money thing is a bit of an annoyance but if this is gana be a legit game like magic i see why they did this shit. i hate it but the game play is solid but the very moment you get this game there is a pay wall.  This is ment for competitive people you will get fucked unless you just play draft or invest the money to get your foot in the door. So ill give it the + because i understand wear its going but i really dont like so far but i know it will probly turne out well in the long run.
To anyone complaning about this game being pay2pay. For the base price you can play preconstructed decks which are pretty fun(there's 6 different types currently which might rotate). If you don't like the starter decks and don't get anything good from 10 starting packs you can always play unlimited free phantom draft. If you get better you can start earning packs by using up your tickets.
One of the best TCG's I've ever played.  And for all of the reviews that say its Pay to Win...guess what.  Every single tcg is p2w. Every. Single. One.  Just because this one doesn't give you a login bonus or let you recylce cards into other cards doesn't mean its any worse than one that does.

Deep strategic gameplay, and addictive and intense games have already lost me about 20 hours of my life and I have no regrets. 

And if anybody wants to play a round, I'm down! :D
On the whole I really like playing Artifact. I look forward to new cards and expansions and think the backbone of the game is super fun. There is the occasional RNG punishment that you can't really do anything about, but there was clearly a lot of thought put into recreating the Dota experience and I think it puts the mechanics of magic to shame. The bot play is strong and collecting a set of cards is much easier than your Hearthstones thanks to the marketplace. There's a lot of schadenfreude in these reviews, something I never really understand, but if 20 bucks is breaking your bank you definitely shouldn't play a CCG. Every single one of them is designed to bleed you dry. You get off LIGHT in Artifact by comparison...
First, dont listen to the reviews from people that play the game less than 5 hours. Just a few salty [spoiler]( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) u kno wat[/spoiler] fangays.

[b]Pros : [/b]
[list]
    [*]The best card game atm. Trust me. The thrill, the decision making, the comeback. No other card game can reach this level of fun.
    [*]So many good system especially in-game Tournament system. It can go so much farther in later expansion with Replay system, Spectating feature and probably a Ladder system since this game use the same engine as Dota 2.
    [*]Marketplace makes building decks sooooooo much easier. You dont need to spam thousand of packs to get the exact card you need for your deck.
[/list]
[b]Cons : [/b]
[list]
    [*]Cost money in constructed. If you dont have money, you can't play constructed in this game. Unless you only want to play draft modes which cost nothing. NOTHING.
    [*]A bit P2W. Okay, before you make any assumption, I'll just tell you here, it's a bit P2W. Did you see I wrote [b]a bit[/b] there? Yes, it's just a bit. The difference between HIGHEST price deck and $~20 deck is negligible. Especially if you know what to do with free 10 packs and 5 tickets that you get after buying the game. I wrote $~20 there, because you can't expect to own every match without spending a dime after buying a game. Dont you guys have money?
    [*]A lot of missing features for now. Game still new and a lot of things can be improved. And knowing valve, they always listen to the community which is good.
    [*]Game is not for kids. Go play HS instead so you can farm cards forever for free then get raped hard by P2W whales. LUL.
[/list]
[b]Mark my words. Artifact will be the next big thing in E-Sport. No Kappa[/b]
Artifact is a modern masterpiece, completely changing the landscape of TCG's as we know it.

Artifact is:
  - Innovative
  - Story Rich
  - Graphically Beautiful
  - Challenging
  - Addictively fun (provided you win of course)

It's no Half LIfe 3, but valve should be proud of what they have produced. The majority of the negative reviews are complaining because they want to complain. If they honestly believe that the minor problems this game has (high competitive entry price, and not being a traditional game such as an FPS) then they are stupid.

I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who appreciates TCG's / Table top games and wants a challenge.
Like honestly, this is a good card game, its just like a REAL PHYSICAL card game, but on a computer. Buy cards, trade cards, play game. Its really indepth when it comes to strategies. If people complain about how the card economy works, then don't mind them. Don't mean to sound gate keepy here, but thats how it works. This is a REAL Trading Card Game.
The game is great. It is the best card game I've ever played.
Three boards and simple step of selecting where spawned hero goes gives the game an enormous amount of strategic depth. The balance is also really good. All the games I had are incredibly close. Every win feels like a payback for invested effort, every loss makes you question whether you could make different choices (and you often find a place to improve).

The pricing feels painful, but even for initial $20, you get 2 decks, 10 card packs, 5 event tickets (which is total of $25 game market value), if you want to play constructed. BUT! You can play Casual Phantom Drafts for free, and that is the best mode in the game, where you have the same conditions as your opponent, and can use all the cards in the game.

There is also currently "Call To Arms" event, which allows you to play 5 great preconstructed decks for free. So — great value for initial investment, even if you don't plan on spending more. Go ahead and try it!
Watching some of the tournaments for the game has been great at piquing my interest in returning.  I used to think the game was overwhelming in its' complexity, but after hearing some of the casters talk through the potential options, and then later watching some streamers talk while they played, it made the game seem more approachable.  Now I feel like I can anticipate moves of my opponent better!
I don't typically review anything, but the amount of people saying this game is pay to win/play is crazy.

Drafts are free if you don't want to invest anything outside of $20. Even if you play this game for 10 hours, you're paying $2/hour.

Buying the 3 most expensive cards right now, plus the price of the game is about $58, which you absolutely don't have to in order to be competitive in constructed, but even if you do, regular games are still priced at $60 per title.... still making this game cheaper.

Almost every single game I've played, draft OR constructed, comes down to the wire. This game feels more like chess than a card game, and if you're into deep customization and fun competition, I would highly recommend this game.
Quit it guys. It's fun. You don't have to spend hundreds of dollars to play the micro transaction lottery. You just pick and pay for them. It's fun. Try it out, if you don't like it write a reveiew and get a refund.
Artifact is a very interesting game, but it's not going to convert non TCG players in the same way Hearthstone does. The multiple lanes, fights for initiative, and overall lateral thinking that Artifact offers to players is a cerebral and engaging experience that is pretty unique among the genre. 

This is not a flashy card game, most of the excitement comes from realizing you [b]have[/b] done the math right and found lethal by just a few points of damage (think of making a run on a server in Netrunner). 

Like all Valve multiplayer games: this one is real bare-bones so it's best enjoyed with friends. Matchmaking exists but losing to silent randos is only so fun in card games.

Right now the presentation is pretty, but it doesn't "wow" me. It feels like (if the game lasts this long) a year or two down the road we'll look back on this UI and chuckle sensibly at how misguided it was.
This is my first TGC, I bought it because I have logged over 6000 hours in DOTA2. Honestly, I think it's great, I have had some really good games so far and lost to some very well thought out plays. I'm still diving into the game and trying to build my own deck strategies, but I'm planning on getting some friends into this game too, just because I think it will be fun to play with an open mic.

I like how the transactions are set up in this game because they emulate a real card game. As I said, I'm a noob at TCG's but this game comes highly recommended from me.
People don't like that it's not free. They don't like that they have to play around RNG like in EVERY other card game. They don't like that they're not already great at the game. They don't like that they are facing higher level players because other people left the game because they didn't like all of these things. 

Good game. 9/10 needs more cards is all.
I really enjoy this game, the mechanics are great and its complex without being confusing. However, a lot of people have slammed the monetisation model, which I think is not worse than other card games for a few reasons:

1) Getting specific cards in Artifact is often much cheaper than in e.g. Hearthstone, since you can just buy the card instead of having to buy packs and hope to open it or having to buy enough packs to get enough dust or wildcards to craft it (you can also use the second method to get cards in Artifact, but there are currently only about ten cards costing more than the price of a pack).

2) You can get more value out of cards you don't want in Artifact. In most card games, you have very diminishing returns on cards you don't want, e.g. in Hearthstone's system, it costs 4 times as much to craft a card as you get from dusting it. In Artifact, you can just sell the cards and much higher returns (valve takes a bit on each trade and the steam marketplace comes with it's own tax, but you're still getting upwards of 50% of the cost of the card). The exception is for very cheap cards because the various taxes get rounded up, but these cards can be turned into event tickets.

3) The highest rarity for Artifact cards is rare and there is a rare in every pack. This means the supply is kept high, so the price is kept low.

Ultimately, the game will cost money to play, and it will cost money to stay competitive. It would be nice to to have just one initial investment, or to have a free to play model, but this system has its benefits:

4) If this game had no microtransactions, it would cost more. This would mean that people who just want to draft, or who are happy to just put in a little bit of money for a single deck (like me) would have to pay more.

5) The fact that every card has monetary value means that you can cash out and get back some of the money you spent on the game if you want to stop playing.

So all in all, I don't think the monetisation system is all that bad. It could be made cheaper, but ultimately valve needs to make money off of this game, so it can only get so cheap before they decide it's not worth maintaining.
From a perspective of how the game plays, it is a lot of fun. I will continue to play it, but there are some flaws. Mostly has to do with a lot of the paywall stuff as other reviews stated. Looking past this though, this game has tons of potential to be really damn good. 

Pros:

-Unique Gameplay, offers a lot variety
-Trading market is easy to use and provides a lot of flexabilty. It gets rid of having to buy packs for cards
-Game will recieve tons of content for years to come
-Already get a nice set of good cards, can resell extras for new cards 

Cons:

-Lack of progression system
-No Daily to try and unlock cards easier (not begging for packs, but this how to cope with mobs more)
-Competitve scene costing money is a bit of a turn-off due to the cards not being physical. 


I do think over time these issues will be fixed and addressed. Valve has a good track record of keeping games balanced without trying to put Pay2Win aspects in it. 


This is a good game!!  You might not win every game, the games take 40+ min, but they are real fun!  The pendulum of battle swings back and forth, you never feel like ther game is a lost cause.  I have come back from a real disadvantage, and with some cleaver moves, BAM  win!  So far no Hearthstone "not Meta not win".  And the wins feel earned as a result.  It is more complicated than ther other CCG out there, but that makes the game more rewarding.  To me Other CCG,s have become stale with the same old play mechanics.  

One con are the flying card guys,  too cutsie.  

I have yet to spend any additional money onm the game.  Still learning though.
High IQ adults card game. WARNING: not for kids like hearthstone. 

Only problemo is that gaben tries to steal all my money and doesn't want to give me any rewards for playing the game. BAD MANNERS.

But in conclusion: Best game ever made. Half-Life 3, Portal 3, Left for Dead 3 deserved to die for this game.
Extremely fun tactical game play. Great Graphics. Valve does not disappoint. 

Best to ignore the reviews from 'kids' and 'man baby's' expecting a traditional card game to be completely free (competitive aspect). 
It was normal growing up in the 90's/early 2000's going to the store/markets to buy booster packs and singles to build desired decks, part of the fun really. IF you want to you can play the game without spending a dime (plenty of game modes for this) however competitive play would mean potentially spending a few dollars building your desired deck (booster packs are literally like $3 a pack) - you know just like real life trading card games. 

The initial $20 cost of the game covers 10 booster packs that you automatically get when you first play, so the value is there already, some cards you receive may even give you more value than what the initial cost of the game is worth, not all the time but there is a possibility. 

Artifact is a solid and well polished game, entertainment value alone is worth it.  If you're on the fence, watch a few twitch streamers to get a better idea on what the game is about.  OR you can purchase the game and play through the 2 tutorial levels - you can still refund at this point as long as you don't open the booster packs - you get the option to open the packs after you complete BOTH tutorials, not that hard. 

TL:DR don't let the negative reviews about "WAHHH P2W" put you off, they are wrong.
As a long time Hearthstone player and RTS player I figured I needed to take a look at this game. Never really got on with DoTA was too much of a time sink. Anyway at first I was jaded, it seemed very complicated, over complicated even and I fell for the pay to win haters comments and after a brief spell with it a left it alone.

Anyway it still niggled in my mind so I revisited it last week and made an effort to understand it, I went to a deck building site took a look at a few decks tried to copy one and it told me I could buy the missing cards for £2.05 I thought... Damn that's harsh... But then noticed I could sell all my duplicates. I listed them on the market and they sold instantly buffing my account over £4, I then could buy a couple of decks I fancied and still have some cash left.

Spent the weekend, playing it, getting my ass kicked but really enjoying the challenge, its a very rewarding game for the thinkers. I love Hearthstone and cant see myself ditching it after 4 years for this but its a decent distraction.

Simply put its a good game, a lot of work has gone into it and I think most of the negative reviews are pretty unfair.
Deep complex gameplay that rewards skill, lack of balance amongst heroes, way cheaper than most card games out there don't listen to the pay to win whiners - unless you are free to play person with no life this game is WAY more affordable to compete in than anything else out there(hearthstone magic etc) I mean like stupid cheap by comparison. The interactions and decision trees are really deep and rewarding/punishing. I am a 25 year TCG veteran and this game is a breath of fresh air nice to something genuinely different come to the genre.
Loving it. Ignore all these other cheapskates who are so used to Freemium games, that when a decent game comes out at a fair price they have to bitch about it.


The game is very fun, the whole idea of playing 3 games at once in essence and having multiple win conditions really adds to the complexity. The user interface is very well designed and you never feel restricted.
Like most people, I'm not a fan of the monetization system they're using. I understand that it's all for the card economy and whatnot but I don't like feeling that I have to pay for competitive.

On the other hand, this game is awesome. Each round is like a puzzle trying to manage all your lanes and your gold, I love it. You can get all the commons and most uncommons for a combined price of $12CAD or make do playing preconstructed or casual phantom draft for the low low price of $0.
OK I know there is a lot of hate for the p2w fellings out there. But I decided to get it anyway. This game has free phantom drafts. Sure nothing becomes yours but you are able to play in a mode thats not based on the size of your credit card and practice the game to get better and when you feel comforable with being able to win. you can do a competitive phantom draft for one ticket and get what you put in if you get three wins before two losses. sure the structure isn't great but they still allow you to play the game even if you dont want to spend more money.
$20 for free packs and 5 tickets and free drafts for life? count me in.

Also I wouldn't call $20 a paywall, but a social wall to divide those who appreciate resourcefulness and those who are still deluded by illusion of progress.
For those people who just read the first sentence of the review here it is:
I believe this game is great for casual players. (Or players that don't want to spend much money).
Now let me elaborate.
Although like many I was concerned by the only method you can really get cards is to purchase them with REAL money. (Unlike hearthstone, it is pretty much impossible to get cards without spending money. )
But wait...
This is where Artifact sets itself appart, you don't need all the cards to be good at the game. (Or many of them) Of course there are some cards that could be bit better and some that could be a bit worse, but in my limited experience this game has a much higher level of strategy then other trading card games. Meaning that a Pro skilled player with a Ameture's deck is sure to beat a Ameture player with a Pro's deck.
But, like Dota the learning curve to this game is quite steep. I've won 1 out of 5 games. 
So maybe not really great for casual players. idk. You choose to buy the game or not. Not me. (Well I did buy it). Anyways if you are like me and you're willing to spend your time, but not much money, to learn the game I think this is meant for you. This game is good at not being pay to win. Especially due to all the drafting game modes.
All and all I like playing this game and I think it was worth my money.
It's so good. Addicting as hell with it's complex mechanics, you learn a thousand new things every game you play. Monetization is kinda bogus, but it's better than hearthstone in the sense that you don't have to gamble to get the cards you want, you can just buy the specific ones off the steam market (also no grinding which is nice). You're able to play with the event decks (there's 5 of them) free of charge against other players for just practice or just fun. If you're unsure about it, buy it and play the two tutorials, and you can still refund it if you don't like it as long as you don't claim the starter packs after completing said tutorials. Valve probably should've made that into it's own free demo because that's what it essentially is but now you know. Try it out!
Fantastic card game. Every match so far has been extremely intense. It feels like some features are missing (like a ladder or some kind of progression), but the game itself is great.
Fun.
A lot of different combinations
It is not pay2win as a lot of people say, you obviously need to pay the get new cards yet this give the old feeling of playing cards with your friends and see how it really you create a good deck with you what only have. 
Cards are not expensive nor packs.
10/10
This shit is dank. 9/10 So far.
If you're really butt-hurt about the price just play casual phantom draft all day, it's easily worth the 20 dollar price by itself.
I  think the best way to describe me awaiting this game was skeptical. I don't like DOTA much, I don't like card games but.. still it's Valve. Might be time to give this genre a shot.

The beginning was chaotic, hard, confusing, as expected. But it got better, and I'm pretty hooked right now - still having much to learn though!
If you like complex decision-making this is a good game. I believe people have merely scratched its surface as for now.

There is a (low-volume) gambling aspect to the game, which can make it very exciting. 

Unless you want to play constructed (that might be the case if you're familiar with card games, otherwise why would you ?) you don't have to worry about all the fuss that is made about the cost of the game (the price might even be negative in some cases, you'll find out why).

I can't think of real downsides to the game. Simply, some things that you find elsewhere (profile, rankings, history, chat...) are not there, but those things have their drawbacks as well.
A lot of the complaints on this game critique the way it is monetized. There are currently not ways to earn packs for free. However, you can buy cards on the steam market place and at the time of this review only 2 cards are priced over 10$. Those two cards are of the highest rarity and are heroes, so you only need one of them for a complete set. The arguments that this is pay to win is probably fair. But if Artifact is pay to win so is Hearthstone or any other competing digital card game. The difference is in Artifact you aren't forced to buy 40$ in packs and then dust cards for the card you want, instead just go on the market spend way less and just buy it. If you plan on playing constructed that is the way to go. The monetization is in reality much more fair than other competing card games (Hearthstone). Those games are "Free to Play" but if you actually want to be able to be competitive or play with something other than the most basic of cards you will have to either spend way more money than you need to one Artifact or simply grind for weeks only to have cards nerfed or rotate out.
this is a very good game. i have never played a digital card game with such depth and strategy, much like dota2 there is infinite complexity to it. and valve did a very good job emulating dota2 in a card game, my only criticism of the gameplay is that there is some randomness similar to dota2 and heroes dont level up during a match. but overall its exactly what you would think dota2 would be like as a card game

unfortunately hearthstone and other similar games have warped some peoples expectations on what a digital card game should be like, as this game is not a skinner box to keep you playing as there is no way to earn cards ingame, only with real money. at first that sounds like a bad thing but if you understand artifact and understand other digital card games its really not. vast majority of artifact cards cost cents and you dont have to spend many dollars to build a good deck. if you would want to build a good deck in other digital card games you would spend far more money because you cant just buy what you want, you have to rely on luck. even a deck containing the most expensive cards costs far less on average than a top competitive deck in hearthstone for example. this game is for people who value time, but also value money. you cant grind yourself a top tier deck over months but you dont have to spend hundreds to obtain it either

however you dont actually have to spend any money to have fun with the game. the signature/competitive mode of the game called phantom draft has a casual version which is free to play and doesnt use any cards in your collection. this game mode is the most fun you can have in the game and i dont personally need any rewards or unlocks to play it, however if you need rewards for playing then artifact is definitely not for you. the reward is the fun you have while playing
If you want to play a game where the best player wins a large majority of the time, this is a good game to pick up. On top of that its got the best monitization model I've ever seen in a TCG. As of posting this you can buy a full collection for right about $100 bucks. And if you don't wanna do that, you can draft infinitely for free using the full collection. You can also compete in draft tournaments using the full collection for free. This game is fantastic for the competitive card player. Don't listen to the whinning babies without the capacity to make informed reviews.
People that are stating that the game is P2W clearly didnt played the game at all, the game offers you enough to start with and if you manage those well you can make atleast 2-3 constructed decks or play arena as much as you like.
The playerbase size is a problem but outside of this and however you feel about the potential of pay to play, the game is a wonderful card game. If you are not a fan or RNG, this could be a problem for you, but most card games feature RNG (and shuffling the deck is a form of RNG). I am a long time Dominion (Deck building game) and the three lane coverage and movement are fun for me.
I’ve played Hearthstone, EsL, MtG, eternal, and well, to many card games to count.  None have given me the satisfaction fro m a loss or win like Artifact has.  I’ve mainly always been a constructed card player, but have found myself enjoying the free unlimited draft mode called “phantom draft.”  I started out terrible losing most of my games until I started to learn the cards and I got better. Now I’m considering trying the “expert” draft mode. Overall this game plays smoothly, has a huge variety of cards for a launch game, and so many different win conditions with each deck.  With time and updates, this game could vary well be on the level that hearthstone is today.
Best digital card game strategy wise

If you dont wanna spend just play casual phantom draft, its free, gives access to all cards equally to all players of the mode, and is draft, which is for most people the most fun game mode and also the most competitive.
Fantastic game with many elements that make it stand apart from its competitors and allow it to consistently deliver very close games with a steady supply of impactful decision points. Its unsteady release and poor player retention is troubling for its long-term health, but Valve has said that they're going to stick with this game for the long term, and Valve has earned my trust many times over with the quality and longetivity of their games.

The $20 is a low price to pay for a quality card game, and it was easier to "go infinite" in this game than any other CCG or TCG I've ever played. Even if you can't consistently win enough in the prize modes to sustain them, playing a draft is literally $1 and there's a mechanically identical free casual format for both draft and constructed.
Ignore any review with less than 10 hours played, there is a pretty steep learning curve that some people can't manage.

Worth buying a complete collection? No.
Worth buying tickets to play 'Expert mode'? Currently, no.
Worth $20? Absolutely yes.
this is the best card game ever made. everybody complaining about it has less than 100 hours on the game.
i repeat.
 THIS IS THE BEST CARD GAME EVER MADE. and its dirt cheap. hop on in
Don't listen to casuals whining about the monetization of the game. These people don't get that this game isn't another Hearthstone and isn't trying to either. Artifact is designed as a complex, highly competitive game like MTG, which requires dedication and money. The fact that you can buy most cards under 0,10€ is underappreciated.

People also often forget about Casual phantom draft, in which you get access to ALL cards currently in the game.

Artifact is a fun, thrilling, complex and addictive game with a the potential to become the definition of a competitive card game.
I'm not going to defend the buisness model, which I think is garbage, but I've had a lot of fun with the base gameplay. There's enough free stuff to do (draft and rotating free decks) that I have 70ish hours in the game without spending any money. Being able to use those free rotating decks against friends is really nice.

Not the best game ever but good fun, and decent value if you only spend the inital 20 quid.
The game is one of the best card games out there. It's not for everyone: it's not casual, but its fun and tactical, and each game feels pretty unique. It's way better than Hearthstone for sure, and I have a couple of hundred hours and spent 200+ in that game. The monetization model is more than fair in Artifact, but people like to complain. I think in 6 months, the game will still be going strong. People like to bitch because they are mad that the game is hard. 

Dota is hard too, and look at all the its a dying game memes for the past 10 years? Good thing it still hasn't died.
Really awarding TCG that promotes skill over RNG. Lots of close matches and when you lose, its almost all the time the cause of missplay or the opponent just outplaying you instead of getting lucky.
Great game. Better than fucking hearthstone which only goal is to con you out of money by making it ridiculously tedious to grind the cards neccesary. Artifact has great and fun modes such as Phantom Draft, which I've been mainly playing. I do hope they stay actice with buffing/nerfing cards (*cough* axe/lc *cough*).

8/10 overall so far.
The game is really good, deeper than other card games. Yes it doesnt reward you money(cards) by playing like other card game. However you can just buy most cards for 5 cents. So think of this game as having a price of 60 dollars. It is not a free game.
Artifact is a modernized and digital version of Magic the Gathering set in the DOTA universe developed by Valve and Richard Garfield, the original creator of Magic the Gathering.

Pros
- Extremely polished.
- Extremely high skill ceiling.
- Gameplay is demanding when you want to play well, a thinking man's game.
- The draft mode can be played for free unlike any other digital card game on the market.
- Cards have real (Steam Wallet) monetary value (I've made 250$ so far just by playing the game).
- Fully voiced flavor/lore text for each card.

Cons
- Constructed play is significantly inferior to draft play although this hopefully will be remedied when new sets of cards are released.

I'd recommend Artifact to anyone and everyone interested in a deep and interesting competitive card game.
Lots of fun, surprising depth (strategy > baddest cards), and a huge step up from the kings of pay to win. Complaints about monetization are over blown. This is BY FAR the cheapest TCG. Anyone crying about combos or synergies just wants to brute force their way to the top of a ladder without skill. Full disclosure I have spent $20 on packs and sold my exess cards on the market. Now I have built 2 of the top 5 decks on Artifactfire.com but that doesnt matter because strategy and a little luck are far more important. Matches can turn on a dime.
I have played Artifact since it's release and I 100% recommend this game to everybody.  I do tell people I recommend Artifact to they should save their 10 packs and tickets you get for free until you know what you want to do with them.  If you enjoy drafting then play two keeper drafts and sell off the cards you don't want.  If you are into constructed then open the packs and hope the get the cards you want.
PLEASE KEEP THIS COMMUNITY ALIVE, VALVE.
Extremely in-depth and addicting gameplay; costs cheaper than the majority of other card games as for now. It has so much potential but lacks proper supports from people. I hope it changes when the new expansion comes out.
For all of those whiners out there, Artifact is not TRASH, it's just not for YOU. 
This game really doesn't deserve this much unreasonable hate, smh.
Needs a ton of work, balancing, a new economy, but the potencial its huge, and I dont want to give up on valve. maybe in a couple of weeks or months we get to see a major improvement.
Pros:

>Medium playerbase with an average of 3000 players at any given time.
>A lot of card variety hence the different variety of gameplay.
>Gameplay can be both simple & complex.
>Very unique three lanes gameplay.

Cons:

>Can get repetitive in terms of the gameplay itself however this would depend on the person.
>The strategic & tactical aspects are somewhat shallow.

Overall if you are unsure I would suggest you wait & see how the games improves before buying 
it as it is in the very early in developmental stage and many features can be changed, added or removed.

Overall I give it a 6.5/10
Its honestly fun. But for the $20 we spent on the game i would really like some more progression in terms of not having to pull out my credit card to get a new deck.

Currently the only way to get new cards is through leveling up & Draft. You have to save resources for draft (tickets/packs). And if you lose then you're out of luck and you gotta reach in your pockets to get new stuff.

I HATE the way this is business model is setup, however I WILL keep playing. It's fun enough for me too keep me trying to learn and have fun for now but i worry the player base feels the way i do and wont bother spending the $20 on a money trap.
Win Or lose , I love this game , one of top Card game ever even some people won't admit it , and guys This game is still in development. They will make is Great . As a 5k hours player of Dota 2 .

I have feelign that I'd dedicate few thousand hours in this too :)

Reccomended If you are A Card Game. I started mine with Irl Yugioh XD
Ignore the haters, the game is fun and Valve is committed to improving it over time. With the latest progression patch plus announcing commitment to balance patches it's even better.
The monetization system sucks? Sure! But not as bad as many think, even with this big difect the game is still worth buying, deep gameplay, awasome art and flavur text, hilarius interactions, and many more things will come!
While many people complain about how this game can be pricey, I think it's most definitely worth it. As with most Valve games, Artifact comes with a great deal of polish and well thought out game design. The game itself is extremely fun and I often have trouble putting it down. Each hero and creep have voice lines for their lore, chat wheel, and deployment that change depending on the heroes that are in the lane. You can tell a lot of effort was put into this game.

With the recent 1.2 update, almost all of the game's major problems have been adressed: a way to earn packs and tickets for free has been added, cards were rebalanced, and a ladder system was put in place.

With how the Artifact team clearly cares about their game, and how much they've been listening and communicating, I'm very confident that they'll continue to work out the game's kinks. Particularly balancing and earning cards. I very much believe this game is worth people's time and I certainly don't regret buying it.
A lot of these negative reviews are from tossers complaining about HL3.
This game may not be for everyone, yes it does have flaws but 90% of these flaws are NOT gameplay flaws and can be fixed in time. So yes, if you like the game concept you can wait and it should improve with time. The gameplay is by far the best card game I have played, all games are very close and the mechanics are brilliant.

The 10% of gameplay flaws we shall see how valve responds to them. The 90% that are not include the /r/Artifact reddit, features yet to come, and some that are inherited from it being a TCG.
I have been playing TCG's since 15+ years (Odessey block MTG if I recall correctly). I have tried many titles recently, but so far no digital tcg met my expectations, not even Hex, where I had really high hopes that it will beat MTG.
But Artifact is awesome. Has more depth and it's more interesting then MTG (Arena in it's latest incarnation) and miles more than Heartstone or The Elder Scrolls: Legends. Much better than Eternal or Infinity Wars. This is simply the best TCG.
Don't be fooled by the bad reviews. Sure it costs money, but you can sell the cards for real money, and it's much cheaper than MTG Arena to play competitively. I would argue that even a cocain addiction is cheaper than competitive magic nowdays. But Artifact is much cheaper. 
The decline in player numbers can be attributed to the relative difficulty of the game compared to HS or TES:L. As a much more complex game, where netdecks are much harder to pilot, low skill players without patience trying to pay their way towards victories will lose interest quickly. But I'm sure all TCG veterans will love this game.
To recommend the game or not?
I'd say a big yes to that... here's why:


First off, when going through the forums, you'll find a lot of posts and threads about the cost. Yes, if you wish to play expert constructed, you'll likely spend a bit more on a top deck (I thikn if you add another roughly 20-30$ to that starting 20$, you should have a very competitive top deck already also for that).

That said, that's the only mode in which you'll need to put in more money. The casual modes are 100% free, even draft tournaments can be played for free fully. Expert mode requires a token to play, but if you win 3 before you lose 2, you'll get back the token (and if you win more, you get packs that value 2 tokens each). You also already start out with 5 tokens when you purchase the game.

So cost wise, the game is perfectly fine - it could very well be considered cheap even.


The release of the game was a bit of a mess, and it's still early days for the game itself. Some improvements were made in the days after the release, and a few more are still set to come. Personally I'm waiting for a fully ranked mode, where the ranks are also visible somehow, and ways to qualify for larger torunaments with big $ prizes... but that's just me.

The gameplay itself is never the same, even if you play the same deck. It's very similar to the other game the developer made (Magic the Gathering) as in how to build up a deck, but it plays out very strategically due to the 3 lanes for which you can play your cards, and the need to either win two of the lanes, or to win one very hard before the opponent wins the other two. It might be a little bit of a challenge to get into at first as now most players have some time in the game already and have the experience of knowing the cards and what to expect, but even a new player can get into it quite fast. It's got a learning curve that's easy to learn, but tough to fully master - even with there only being one card set at the moment (once most people will have gotten close to mastering it, then a new card set could theoretically turn things around quite a bit again due to the new possiblities players would have).

What are the downsides of the game - there must be some?

Well, yes... a draft tournament pits you against others who also choose to play draft - not per se against those that were choosing cards when you did. This means that picking a card for the reason that at least your opopnents don't get it, is almost useless - a difference compared to most draft tournaments. Also it's possible to be placed against the same opponent twice in a row (I've had it happen within the same tournament). It's rare, but it happens.



Looks and sounds are things I generally interested in much less than the average player, and due to where I play, I always have the sound turned off. But the game is made to be fun; the two little dragons (or whatever they are supposed to be) are a lot of fun added in to the gameplay, without actually affecting the game in any way.


I'll be very positive here and give the game an 8/10 rating right now, with a very likely chance for that rating to go up even more with future small improvements like the ones already announced.
I don't write reviews often, I also have not played any other online card games (never played Hearthstone or anything like that)

I decided to give this a try despite the microtransactions/trading. I viewed this similar to how Magic cards were when I was growing up.

Lately I've been playing Disney's Villainous with some friends so I was itching for some more card game action. 

I spent about $15~ on building myself a good deck based on some guides I found online and this has made for some very challenging games. 

Typically most games I'm doing about 50/50 win/loss ratio with this new deck I made. The games I lose are usually by a thread which makes for a really exciting game. 

Pros:
-Really addictive gameplay
-When you win there is something just oddly really satisfying about crushing your opponent
-Games go quick, roughly 20-30 minutes tops. 
-After 10~ or so games you really get the hang of what abilities people use based on the cards/combo's they have
-No game is ever the same
-I crushed some dude in a game who had a clearly put some money into his deck including a card that costs nearly $20 last I checked. This was very satisfying to know I can still win despite what cards people buy. 

Cons:
-Wish they had more stats tracking
-I like multiplayer coop games generally but this one is only 1v1 so can't really play with friends unless it's against them
-Some people say it's pay to win, yes while you do have to get good cards to play competitively you can always play draft mode which is pre-built decks. I forked up another $15 and it's like I paid for a premium game. 

Anyway, I think the game is great and definitely worth getting.
If have common sense, a basic understanding of probability, and card games you’ll enjoy the game. 

Valve already stated they’re working on a progression system so don’t worry.

The gameplay itself is absolutely amazing. I love DOTA and I love this game too. 
However, like many others already mentioned, there are problems with this game. To me, I think what will destroy this game is the imbalance of gamers' experience and adhesiveness due to the fact that winning in this game depends on $ spent not purely skills. 

Players now are not able to get tickets or packs without spending money. And if we don't spend money, we will be disadvantaged when playing against players who spent a lot of money buying cards. 
This contradicts with DOTA. DOTA is so fun to play with not only because the game itself is great, but also the competition to win depends on the skills and collaboration of each individual player within the game. We always have the motivation to improve our skills and mindsets to play better the next game. 

But in Artifact, buying packs/spending money already makes the gameplay imbalanced.

Now, I know most card games sell packs, but isn't that also the reason those games couldn't get big? 
I played Hearthstone before, the above mentioned is also the reason I left. 
If spending $ makes a player having advantages over others in gameplay in DOTA, would DOTA still exists? 

Please valve. Make a change
Currently Artifact offers a very deep and competitive tcg experience.
The tournament scene is well up and running and the game is highly enjoyable.

A lot of players are crying about p2w aspects. Sure, you are the underdog if you play constructed format with a very limited card pool. But at least for me, the real challenge and fun is in the draft mode. In draft there is no advantage for people spending money on the game.

Some people have been also crying about balance and rng in the game. Cards such as Axe has been the target of constant "op!" cries from the community. However, recent pro tournament 1st place deck didn't even use Axe, nor red for that matter. We even saw a mono black deck in the tournament. The rng in Artifact is a bit higher than in other tcg. That said, you have dozens of cards to manipulate that rng in your favour. It's more of a deck building aspect whether you like more rng or not.

Many have also brought up the aspect of not earning cards trough playing. In current form it would destroy the entire economy as all cards are viable for steam market, which would result in no boosters sold anymore. So any type of market / trading would be immedietly off the table if earning cards via grinding (like bot grinding) would be possible. However, more skilled players are able to earn cards without spending money. As an example I started on official release day and have not bought a single ticket for phantom drafts. Yet I have gotten dozens of boosters for free via rewards. The recycling system implemented (20 cards = 1 ticket) makes sure that you can sustain tickets as long as you play better than your average joes.

The game also includes free game modes for those who still need / should train before entering the expert leagues. This can rightfully feel wrong as there is no experience system or anything to be achieved other than better understanding of the game. This part here is imho the biggest issue Artifact currently faces. We need to be able to progress in some way outside of free cards to keep interest.

Currently Artifact is only for those die hard tcg fans that love a highly competitive scene. Artifact is truly missing the feel of progress and achievement for casual players.
Absolutely fantastic game. I mostly play phantom drafts, and most games feel very close. And while there are some RNG elements, most games I've played ultimately felt like they came down to play choice. I do feel like there is room for the game to improve (new expansions and player stats, for one. I would also like to see skins for the imps and alternative card art for constructed), but there is plenty to enjoy now, and I only seeing it getting better.

(Marked as free because it was a gift from a friend)
I wouldn't listen to the people crying over card prices. I looked past them and found myself enjoying this TCG much more than I enjoyed playing MTG with actual cards. Yes, the cards do cost actual money. Regardless of this, through playing games with the Call To Arms gauntlet (the preconstructed decks are free to play with until the event ends) I found a playstyle I enjoyed. WITHOUT PAYING FOR ANY CARDS I constructed a deck and won two matches in Casual Constructed with my deck. Of course, there are cards I could purchase to make the deck that much better. I feel that the people who are upset over having to pay for cards rather than earn them are also the people who do not view a players deck when they lose. Do not figure that your opponent bought his entire deck, instead view their deck and learn how to make yours better.

Straying away from the pay to win argument, Artifact is a wonderfully beautiful TCG. It's presentation as well as gameplay is top of its class and its a joy to play. If you find yourself wondering whether you should get it, you should give it a go.
This is easily my favorite digital card game. The level of complexity and strategy in this game blows other major digital card games out of the water without being too overwhelming. The game heavily taxes both short and long-term decision making skills. The game strikes the perfect balance between interactivity and gameplay speed, avoiding the competitive solitaire feeling of games like Hearthstone and the clunky phase-passing of games like Magic Online.

In terms of presentation, the game is top notch. The art and visual effects of the game are really good, but where the presentation truly shines is in the voice acting. Almost every unit in the game has multiple voice lines, including ones for being paired with/against other units. And EVERY SINGLE CARD has fully-voiced flavor text, which is especially impressive when you realize that most cards have a full PARAGRAPH of flavor text. Almost all of this text is funny/interesting and expands upon the lore of the Dota 2 universe, and it's all very well acted.

While the game's monetization model is a point of contention among many, it is, in my opinion, the most fair and honest monetization model of any major digital card game. Being able to list the deck you want to build, then see how much that deck will cost you, is something I really appreciate. There's no need to get a bunch of packs in hopes that you get the cards you need, then get even more when you inevitably don't. No more dealing with the industry standard of the forced choice between grinding for months with inferior decks and spending tons of money that you can never get back. And all of that is assuming you even want to play constructed, and, with the $20 purchase, in addition to the packs and event tickets, you get unlimited access to the best limited format of any card game.

In short, while it may not be up everyone's alley, if you've found other digital card games to be lacking, I highly recommend  giving Artifact a try.
Decision making at his finest.
Recommanded. 

but : I wish you best luck, i recommand to invest 50€ to have one or two descents deck and have fun. 
But ! I've passed long time creating decks with a friend, and, missing 1 or 2€ to made a good change... meh. Don't buy fancy s**t food and you have it.
But ! You can play 'free' to the "Arena mode from Hearthstone" ( who was already made by magic, that's not the subject here )
And, that's cool.
Don't listen to the jobless children whining, this game is very decent payment wise, and offers what no other card game on the market does, a market to buy individual cards and a free draft mode for play.

For the base price of 20 bucks and nothing else, I managed to trade away a few rares on the market and get all commons and the majority of uncommons in the game. The few anomalies price wise such as Axe and Annihiliation will stabilize in time.

Other than the obviously superior business model than any other card game on the market, the gameplay is amazing, deep, complex and difficult. And every single card has written and voiced lore.

This game simply one ups all of its competitors in every category with ease. You will never regret buying it.
The Valve nailed this game, absolute 10/10.

They managed to get everything wrong with MTG right for their card game.
Some people dont seem to realise that this is a collectors game and the inability to get cards for free as absolutely necessera to stop the inflation. I imagine the valve doesnt seem to care about these customers anyway, they dont have the money to spend here and dont understand the joy of collecting digital cards and playing with them.

Gameplay and climate are overall superb and I am going to keep spending long hours in Artifact still.

Please valve never change this game!
Excellent gameplay, and the negative hype about the monetization scheme is unwarranted. It's cheaper than other card games, but without any rewards for just playing. This means you will need to spend some $$, but a little bit goes a long way. If you like drafting, the system is great: you can do free casual drafts (no rewards, no keeps) to practice, then go into events for less than $1 each (you can buy cards for less than 0.05 from folks who don't want tickets, then turn 20 cards into a ticket).
Honestly, I feel that games like Heathstone and Gwent require a lot more money to actually get the cards you want. Sure, there are some expensive rares that are quite powerful, but I have decks doing fairly well that I might've spent $2 total to build. 

It's quite a steep learing curve, but stick it out.
Not good at the game yet but it is deep intense and there are free casual ways too play so you learn the ins and outs of the game a lot of the mechanics are deeper than they first appear if you look at the pay model as an IRL TCG then it isnt bad if i played magic i fuggin wish the boosters where 2 dollars...As a card game its the best all hail GABEN!
Easy to learn, but tons of depth. This is by far the best online card game that I've played. Although there is no progession and you have to buy the cards, you can buy singles and a lot of cards are as cheap as $0.05. There are plenty of free modes too, like phantom draft, that you can play as much as you want without ever putting more money in.

Lots of ways to play, and all of them are fun!
Pretty good game tbh, for those who said this game is pay to win it's not true
You can beat a pay to win player with strategy, i tried using basic deck and i could keep winning the expert play which earns free card packs and tickets
its so easy to earn back the 20 dollar 'entrance fee' when youre actually just buying 10 packs with that fee, u draft the cards that sell the most then sell them back and u earn a profit. free tournaments with friends and free drafts the game is good.
Bought in with $20 and only got 10 packs? Heros cost $9 on market? game is P2W! I will stick with playing 
[spoiler]Magic the Gathering[/spoiler] :kappa:
I'm normally not the guy who writes reviews about games, but I just can't understand why this game is getting so much negative attention.

Gameplay and the game overall are rock solid.
The money model of this game is also very good, you buy the game, get 2 decks and some packs.
Cards are piss cheap on steam market, you can literally make a deck for 5$, try that in hearthstone or MTGO/MTGA..
There is free draft mode ?! Like wtf that is insane, no game in the world lets you draft for free.. 

For me, Artifact is a solid 9.5 / 10 !
I'm really enjoying this game, and I think it's a lot more fun than Magic: The Gathering Arena

Most of the negative comments are based around the fact that to get new cards,  you have to pay for packs, which obviously contain new cards.  There are a LOT of options if you do not want to buy new packs, or at the very least, keep the  amount of extra money spent on cards to a minimum.

* Play casual phantom draft:  This is probably going to be one of the most fun modes to start.  Take turns drafting two cards from five packs of cards two at a time, and then play it against other players who are also doing phantom draft.  The mode is free, you play against other players who also had to create their deck the same way, but there are no rewards of cards or tickets at the end.  

* Buy the cards you need and play casual constructed: You can buy individual cards you might need, and can create a really competivie deck for about $10.  Playing casual constructed costs no money (tickets), but does not reward tickets or cards.

What I hated about Magic: The Gathering Arena is I felt like I had to play everyday to grind out daily quests so I could get free packs playing with sub-optimal decks.  There are only so many different "meta" decks that everyone plays with, and I can usually figure out how I'm going to lose within two or three turns because everybody plays the same decks.

And maybe the same thing will happen with Artifact.  There are definately some really good cards that everyone plays if they have them, but I still have not seen a lot of people play the exact same thing.  And if the state of the game ever gets to that point, casual phantom draft will keep things interesting.

I'm really not understanding the hate over the lack of daily rewards.  Artifact is fun to play, plain and simple.  It's more engaging that Magic: The Gathering Arena, there's more to think about and plan for.  I also love how I have NEVER had a game where I felt I was completely screwed right off the bat from a bad starting hand.  In Magic: The Gathering Arena I was always frustrated by lack of mana, or lack of needed cards.  Don't get me wrong, there's definately randomness in Artifact, but the game overall feels more driven by skill and less by luck.

It will be interesting to see how the game evolves, but so far it's absolutely worth the initial investment.
Good "card" game, you can play every card for free in the draft mode, or buy cards directly in the market for constructed instead of praying RNG in packs.
Community tournaments are a big plus
I like the mechanics, love the art style and overall just enjoy playing this game. And the cost of cards really aren't that high, most cards cost a few cents to purchase and you can get a pretty decent deck spending just 10-20 bucks.

Also if you're new to the game, go play phantom draft, seriously.
It's awesome. Really addictive competive card game.

You can buy most cards for next to nothing, do that don't buy packs they cost a bomb. 

They are modes where you can use all cards via drafting you don't have to buy any additional cards if you don't want to. 

You don't have to play the pay to play modes either.
Top notch valve quality. The game is NOT for everyone tho - it has a very niche target audience IMO. I'll write an in-depth review later on. I have quite a few grievances with the game's design (for example at times there is no decision making involved in the early stages of the game which can lead to really bad UX). All things considered tho, Artifact is a decent game.

The payment model is something really worth discussing but it requires an in-depth analysis so I'll refrain from any comments on the matter.

I have one major issue with the game as of right now tho - rather complex game systems are not explained properly! I've played hundreds of different card games over the years for thousands of hours and I am somewhat confused about things like hero placement on the board etc.
actually fun card game, you can craft a deck without expensive cards and it will work fine
not a pay2pay or pay2win, dont listen to those f2p crybabies
This review is for potential casual players who fancy giving it go but are put off by the marketplace. 

For your £16 you get the game, obviously, and 10 packs of cards. In the base game, you can play against ai and people using pre-constructive decks which feature a wide range of cards, heroes, and playstyles. You also have unlimited access to the draft mode, where you get to pick your cards before playing (this is random, all cards are possible). 

This alone is worth your money, because - 

The game itself is brilliant, head and shoulders above Hearthstone, in my opinion. It's also incredibly polished. Each hero has a voice acted backstory you can access via the cards, and the in-game interactions are very good. Ogre is hilarious. 

You don't need to buy a single card from the marketplace to enjoy the game.
A deep and rewarding strategic card game, that far outdoes the oversimplified Hearthstone + clones on many levels. If Herathstone is McDonalds then Artifact is more like a tender steak at a good restaurant.  Lots of people will bitch about the price and tell you how McDonalds is even tastier AND a lot cheaper and you can listen to them and go for the fast food or you can go for some quality food and invest an appropiate amount of money for it. 

You will see a lot of reviews here that tell you that the game is great but since you cannot get it for free it somehow justifies downvoting it.  As if it made sense to downvote any normal pay to play game that exists in a space where free to play games also exist just for their existance. 

At the end loads of analysis show that if you have ever been willing to invest SOME money in other free to play card games AT ALL you get way more for the same amount in Artifact. So unless you are a die hard "never spend anything" player the monetization of Artifact shouldn't bother you too much. There is also a reason why Hearthstone makes millions and millions of dollars in revenue every year...because "free" to play apparently.

If you are such a die hard "free to play only and grind hours in unfun and repetitive modes for dumb quests just to save a dime" player then yes, Artifact is not for you. Feel free to stick to your chicken nuggets.
Real fun. Enjoying the free draft mode a lot already. When I want to play constructed I'll probably put $5 into buying commons or something and just live with the rares I've got.
Most people here complaining about the monitization do not understand it. The only thing I can say I don't like is the entry fee but what that really is is buying 10 packs. Yes it costs money to do expert draft and expert constructed but if you win you get rewards. You can play draft for free. People are saying it is pay to win when it is not if you compare it to other card games. In hearthstone I can spend 60 dollars and get 2 or 3 legendarys that I may or may not want and still not even have close to enough dust to make a competitive deck. In Artifact you can create any deck you want and buy all the cards you need for usually under 20. I made a deck I have had success with for about 15 dollars. And you can always sell those cards back to the market to get some of your money back if you want to create a different deck.
Highly recommend this game. Children complain about having to pay for video games now, pretty sad. This is a complex card game with a lot of depth, and if you’re into that, you’ll love it. 

Even though the children are saying that this game is expensive, in reality this game is far cheaper than any TCG on the market, period. Sure, other TCGS are F2P but ALL of those games require tons of hours, or tons of money in order to be competitive. You can do that in this game COMPLETELY FREE. Do not be deceived by the people who haven’t even played the game. Give it a shot I promise you’ll enjoy it if you enjoy TCG’s.
I have 15 hours as of this review clocked into this game, and never in all my tcg life have i played a game with so much complexity. Many of the people giving bad reviews dont understand this game follows the model of most regular TCGS; You go to a tournament? You pay money. You want cards? You pay money. The make it or break it deal to this does reduce the pay to win (soft pay wall of course), but if your cards lose value as the game goes on.... That will turn this game into a negative review. This game did not disappointment in all my wait for it in 2018.
Even if people say this is p2w or whatever, the casual aspect of this game and playing against your friends is really fun. People need to stop bashing on it. You get 1 month of dota plus for free. Which is like £3.20 so you're paying £12-13 for a card game. You get 10 free packs with this and if you want to make your money back, just sell your cards / rares (although this would defeat the purpose.)
Thank you for this amazing card game. I was never a dedicated tcg player but i play alot of dota so the universe seems familiar. Also for the people who think this is a p2w game ill say this: dont make uneducated statements on subjects that you cant comprehend :) . The game has lots of free content after initial buyin and in short time you breakeven with the content you get. Overall, a solid game with a fresh new card game concept.
Game is good. High skill ceiling, but not too hard to get into. I havent spent any more than I initally did on Hearthstone and I'm having a very good time. Good card artwork too :) (I don't normally leave reviews but people are unfairly review bombing this and it deserves a good review)
Despite all toxicity towards this game, it is really fun. If you don't want to spend money there are casual modes, and phantom draft is aimed at playing without any card packs.
Very fun. The monitization model is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be. It's easy to sell cards and get 20$+ and going infinite in stuff like phantom draft is possible. I'd say try it. If you don't like it, you'll most likely get the value of the game back from selling the cards you get from buying it.
First impressions. Game seems really good with deep gameplay. $$$ is not a problem since you can play [u]free draft[/u] in gauntlet(arena format) and and also with your friends(!!).
Great fun challenging friends to matches with custom decks! Gauntlets are challenging but still a blast. Would totally recommend if you're looking for a dope game! As for the paying for packs thing, of course, it's a TCG.
really fun game so far, if anyone was wondering about the monetization/price of the game after purchase, check out this reddit post detailing it: https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/a1ikq9/artifact_has_the_best_monetization_model_of_any/
Great game - Complex and compelling, games are tight and always feel like winning and losing is entirely your fault. The steam market makes the cost of cards entirely transparent, and there's tons of fun to be had with the free drafting and preconstruction deck modes. Launching with features that f2p games like Hearthstone are still missing years later like tournaments, the Valve polish makes this game gleam. Ignore review bombers so enamoured with skimmer box hamster wheels they've forgotten how to have fun without a carrot dangled right under their noses. 5 Crystal Maidens out of 5
This game is not for everyone. If you can get past the not very steep learning curve and enjoy different interesting mechanics in a card game, this might be the game for you. As of now, with 20 Dollars, u get 10 Card packs which itself worth 20 Dollars and addition to that u get another 5 Event Ticket to play Expert Phantom draft to get a chance to win more packs. There is also a Casual Phantom Draft in which u can play it without using any event tickets. For 20 Dollars, I think it worth every penny.
It's a pretty good card game. 

Most negative reviews seems to focus on the monetization model, but you don't need to spend a lot of money like other reviewers are suggesting. While that $15 axe is nice, you can kick ass just fine without it. If you want a full collection, right now you can get it from the market for ~$250, which is pretty comparable to other card games like Hearthstone or MtGA. If you just want some solid decks for constructed, then you can get enough cards for most archetypes for ~$20 total. If you like to play draft like me, then no amount of money will help you.
I dont get all of the people complaining about the buying packs feature of the game, they made very clear that you would have to buy packs, and as someone that came from a multitude of other card games: Magic, Yu-gi-oh, and vanguard; ask anyone and they will tell you that all of the top teir decks are sometimes 300 - 400 dollars. and peopel are complaing that for the first time in a digital card game not only can you buy individual cards, but also you can build the "best" decks for about ~100$~. I love the outcry about this game that isnt trying to rip you off but people will drop 400$ in hearthstone because its f2p, but you wont have nearly all the cards. 

FREE TO PLAY DRAFT 100% of the time, tell me that isnt insane!!
Before adressing the elephant in the room (monetisation), let me quickly review the game purely as a combat card game. It is fantastic, the game is complex, which means it is rather daunting for the first few games, but once you get the hang of the card mechanics, the depth in the game means that playtime will be extreme. This is a game that I can see people putting thousands of hours into. The graphics and style of the game is phenomenal, and all cards seem to work well together.

One of the best things about artifact is the amount of synergy between cards of different colours, which opens up the possibility for very high level play. However, because of the turn-taking nature of the game, these combo's need to be well thought out and planned for, otherwise they can be easily blocked. This aspect of the game is going to be the life-blood of artifact, which will keep the game popular years after release.

Now... Monetisation. This is a very hot topic, and whilst I understand peoples frustration with the "I paid $20, I should get the entire game", people are neglecting the very essence of Trading Card Games (TCG's). You don't need to look further than one of Artifacts main competitors, Hearthstone, to see a godawful way of monetising a TCG.

The reason I believe Artifacts monetisation strategy is fair is the ability to DIRECTLY PURCHASE exactly what you want. No rubbish lootbox mechanics, no "I spent $100 on packs and didn't get the one card I want to build my deck around". To me, this is a no-nonsense approach of what you want, you buy, and I like it a lot more than any other monetisation strategy in any other TCG.

This is also ignoring the ticketed competitive draft, which allows players to pay their way into a competition to win tickets, card packs, and more. It takes 3 wins in this mode to earn your ticket back, essentially winning you the cost of entry.

If you are considering this game, do keep in mind one thing. As far as has been announced, Artifact is NOT ELEGIBLE FOR A REFUND AFTER OPENING THE INITIAL PACKS. Whilst I understand Valve is trying to avoid people farming steam credit, this is extremely anti-consumer. What does this mean? In all other reviews, I would say "hey, the game is fair, buy it and if you really hate it you'll know in the 2 hours"... But in this case, I can't say that.

Having said that, I think you really need to spend time with this game before you will know if this is something you will dedicate a lot of time to. The best way I could recommend it is this - If you liked Hearthstone, but wanted more depth in the mechanics, more collection and deck building mechanics, more synergy between cards and less RNG rubbish, Artifact will likely tickle that spot. Give it a chance though, the first 2-3 hours are daunting, you won't understand anything and it will be a struggle, but once you get there... Oh boy is it good.

I hope this helps, thanks for reading
Yes, you have to pay for more cards, bu what most ppl seemingly havent noticed is, that you can cash out the collectible cards from other games for packs and valve prob expects you do to that. Yes the monetisation is shitty, but if you take that into account, it makes valve seem somewhat more reasonable
I am enjoying Artifact currently, and have only spent money on the initial price tag. I think, compared to other game's monetization (*cough* Hearthstone *cough* MTGA *cough*), this game is very reasonable. Is it the best I've seen? No. But it's not horrible, and I think it's a unique approach that could only be done by someone like Valve. If some random company had decided that, instead of a dust/scrap system, they'd allow you to buy and sell cards, everyone would ignore it. I think it's a nice change of pace, and allows players freedom in the cards they want, without having to spend hundreds of dollars for those specific ones (Hearthstone, MTGA both require you to open packs to garner dust to craft them).

As for the gameplay, it is very enjoyable. As I did not play the beta, I am very inexperienced, but so far I am enjoying playing against the bot and in phantom drafts to get my skills up to par. You start with 5 tickets, which is enough to enter into 5 of either expert constructed or phantom drafts, both of which offer rewards for playing. Like I said, I'm not experienced enough to enter into these modes yet, so I'm playing the free sections to learn the ropes, and eventually I will jump into the expert play.

Whatever your opinion on the economy of this game, it is an enjoyable and refreshing take on the card game genre, and I hope that this game will manage to impact its field in a positive way, just like Half Life did almost two decades ago.
Intense game!

Every play feels impactful. Almost every match is super intense and the cards turned out to be very cheap compared to what people on Reddit speculated. 

This game is extremely competitive and I predict will be a very good esport.
Only problem ive seen gameplay whise with this game is that if you draft better heroes and sometimes cards in phantom draft, basically being the only way you can get more cards, is that you win if you draft better heroes. i bought this game knowing about the scammyness of it but i still wanted to play it and i like it a lot. But i can reccomend this game until they add some free way to get cards and or tickets. cause until then you cant get ANY free cards when you run out of tickets which is a certain eventually that you will get unlucky RNG in rolling for cards and you will lose your tickets slowly.

EDIT: Ive actually refunded a game that was 10 dollars and with that 10 dollars I used it to buy more tickets. I didnt think i would change this review till they added a way to get free cards/heroes but i realized that irl people spend hundreds on Magic the gathering, pokemon, Yugi-yo etc. and buying the game with its starter price of 20 bucks gives you basically a starter pack that you can buy anywhere else irl. not only that but if there were a way to get free cards then people could basically just get free cards to sell on the market and make a huge profit. which doesnt seem like a good thing to do for a game to make free money... you could compare it to Cs:go really because of csgo costing money and ways to buy crates and skins but the thing with csgo is that you can actually get free stuff. but the free stuff is small things that are like 4 cents which you get from just playing games with others games aka trading cards from any game. So i would only recomend this game if you are a hard core card game fan. and if you dont think you will win in constructed where everyone has all the good decks that just stomp yours then play phantom or keeper draft! random cards and heroes for both sides. Then i just sell all my cards cause im never gonna play constructed where people will stomp me and i make profit. and If you practice enough in normal games where you dont lose your tickets or card packs and once you get good you can theoretically get card packs or play keeper draft where you keep the cards you draft (which i recomend because you can pick the most exepensive ones if you get them) then sell your cards for money to buy more packs/tickets or even other games if you get lucky enough. 

So when it comes down to it if you practice before wasting all your tickets right off the bat you can make more money than you spent on the game.
Absolutely love this game! It cost $20 cause that gets you $20 worth of card package. Ignore the haters and if you like card games and challenge. Then step up to the plate and buy this game, worth every penny it's only going to get more updates. Giving a bad review for having the buy this game is like writing a bad review cause you had to buy Fortnite for $30 and get $30 worth of vbucks. Chill don't be ignorant. Buy this damn thing. It's FUN!
• Thematically fantastic
• Excellent UI
• Generous monetisation style
• Beautiful design throughout
[b]• Fun to play[/b]
Many were reluctant to buy (myself included) but the game is charming and [i]exceeds all expectations.[/i]
No more "P2W" than any other card game, and actually pretty cheap when compared to physical CCGs. 

Monetary model aside, the game is super deep and complex and interesting. If you like card games, you should play this.
People complaining about the monetization are actually retarded.
They actually are, just do a quick google search and form your own opinion.

All they do is cry about it not being free to play and they want rewards without putting anything in, which would break the economy.
Anybody with half a brain understands that.
A good portion of the Negative reviews for this game consist of people bashing the open economy of the game saying how its ridiclous for a card to cost £11 witch doesnt hold merit concidering the game hasent even been out for a full day as of yet. people complaining how they prefer skinner box games but still brought this game regardless becuase of whatever reason. and people who just like to jump on the have bandwagon. 

At the end of the end of the day if you like card games such as MTG/Eternal and games with a lot of strategic depth and you dont mind spending about £40-60 per expansion(apposed to heartstones £200+ 3 times a year) then i absolutley recomend this game. it has beautiful graphics, smooth and intresting gameplay, a healthy ammount of RNG.
Valve and richard garfield put a lot of work into polishing this game and i think it came out great dispite everyone complaining about the non-exsistant Pay2Pay game model.
Gameplay: having not participated in Beta, the gameplay is very fresh and different from what I'm used to.  Having played Magic for 2 decades, I've come to develop a certain way of evaluating cards.  While some normal tennets of what makes a good card still hold, there are other aspects that require more experience to develop so I'm very much enjoying these other aspects (such as the lane mechanics, item market, priority sequencing, etc.).  My one complaint is the games have so much layer to it that individual games take a while to finish compared to other card games so you'd probably finish 1 match in the time it takes to finish 3 matches in another game.

Economy: there have been a lot of complaints about the monetization.  I think it's a matter of prespective.  The game is P2P instead of F2P which follows in the steps of Magic Online and Hex.  Your individual cards can be sold for Steambux and you can also buy individual cards with Steambux.  However, there's not any method to get more cards just by playing for free.  There are expert events you can join that costs $1 to enter and rewards $1 if you win at least 3/5 but the majority aren't likely to profit from this.  That said, there are F2P gamemodes that players can play without any fee or rewards so the focus seems to be on the actual gameplay instead of a grind.  

Polish: this game feels very very polished.  Good graphic, voice acting, SFX, and BGM.  The first thing I do when I get a new game is disable BGM but I made an exception for Artifact.  Very good immersion!

Overall: I would say the game doesn't cater to everyone.  It doesn't cater to the strictly F2P grinders so if you are one, I can't recommend it for you.  For everyone else, I highly recommend it!  If you dislike the game, you can sell the cards you opened and get some of your money back to purchase another game.  You might even come out ahead if you open certain cards!
Great Game with alot of potential, you pay for cards in any card game? yu gi oh... pokemon... heartstone.... MTG..... get used to it if you wanna enjoy the competitive part of a card game
Was looking for middle ground between Hearthstone and Magic.

Turns it this game is funnier than Hearthstone while being more complex than Magic.

12/10
If you played CIV V or any other 4xTBS you probably familiar with the term "just one more turn" here it translates to "just one more game". Often whising you could have played just one more turn that last game. Great gameplay.
Pls don't pay attention to all the hate and backlash. I'll give it to you straight and simple. No bullshit. Just a small paragraph. 

This is a pretty unique and well-made card game. If you are looking for a new card game to pick up, like I was, then this is a really good option to consider. Yes, what people are saying about Valve being a little greedy with some of the game mechanics is true, but the game offers a lot for just the initial $20 dollars. No one ever said every card game had to be free to play... It's just what games like Hearthstone have made people think is the standard. And Hearthstone is the game I'm coming from, so I won't hate on it either, because I'll still be playing it even though this game really has my attention right now. They are very different games and I like that. I'm sure Valve will add more free to play mechanics in the future, so I am willing to jump in right now, mainly because I don't think Valve is ever just gonna let this game die, and I'm just gonna enjoy the ride from the very beginning. Most of the cards are very cheap, so you can sell the cards you got from the 10 packs included with the game, buy the cards you like and are interested by with that same money, and make your first good deck. You can then take that deck over to ranked after you know its really good, use one of your five one time tickets, win all the games, get the reward packs and earn yourself some free packs! You have to be really calculated with how you pull this off but it's possilbe and it's exactly what I just did and will do in the days after launch. On top of that, Valve added a cool limited time mode where they've set up some premade decks you can use and you can battle other people with whichever deck you chose. This is a cool way to learn how to play the game with a specific synergistic deck and get some ideas for the kind of deck you want to work towards. You'll have to spend some time and thought into this game, like any other, to get the most from it and your 20 dollars. If you don't like challenging games that make you think, even harder than Heartstone, then this is not the game for you. If you're gonna blow all the stuff they give you with the $20 game without putting any thought behind how you go about things, then complain the game is pay to win or is too expensive, then this is not the game for you. Unlike Hearstone, this game let's you directly buy the cards you want and need to complete your masterpiece of a deck, not make you buy pack after pack trying just to get that ONE legendary you need to make your deck perfect. Think deeply about this game and you will get your value out of it. It is a very unique and fun card game that I have no doubt will live on for years to come like Dota 2 or Hearthstone.
Loving it so far! So glad Valve didn't go with a F2P grindfest and instead focused on making a game that is actually fun to play in its own right. If you never spent anything past the intial $20 the free modes (especially draft) are more than worth the cost of entry. And heck if you really wanted to only play free draft you can just sell all the cards you get with the base game to make most of if not all your money back.

That said, so far the economy is looking quite healthy and it seems like its going to be quite affordable. The most expensive cards right now are around $15 and falling (prices are higher at launch due to low supply)

Valve you have made something great, please don't cave to the silly F2P BS.
Really good game, only bad review I see are from people mad that its not free to play and from people that don't seem to understand how the game works.

A TCG is not a CCG, very different.

Hearthstone is a ccg with what I would say is a far worse monetization system than this, but you can never buy singles, only what your collection is.

A TCG like this, or MTG allows you to buy singles, and IMO has a far better system.

Also people have said you can get basically all the cards for like 50 USD.

Your are not paying to play, you are paying an entry fee which gives you far more cards than what you paid for to start.
Do not be discouraged by the disappointing and bare bones release. This game has a huge amount of potential. Artifact stands out thanks to its beautiful voice acting and attractive visuals. The communty market allows you to acquire almost any card for under 10 cents, resulting in the overall price to obtain every card being lower than all of it's competitors. The core game is very well designed, as are most of the hero cards. The game is already worth a purchase in spite of the issues it has. Once Valve addresses the problems with it and adds many of the quality of life features Artifact needs, I can only see this game getting better with expansions and further updates.
Ok guys, the game is playable now with recent updates and more to come, and ofc, changed my review. Valve games never disappoint me at all. NOW GET THE GAME YOU UNGRATEFUL BASTARDS!!
The game itself is not bad.
Let's see how all the things around it evolve.

Personally I have no problem with this monetization model since I don't have the time to eg log-in daily to get 'cool' rewards. I'd rather spend a few bucks than be forced to put more time in this game as I really want 
TIME = MONEY
This game has no weak sides. It is almost perfect. 
Except "Cheating Death" spell, which is powerful and too random for this amazing skill based game.
I would also ask for Standard Timer for tournaments - why should we limit the creative & deep stragery plays during the tournaments?
Maybe i am stupid, but i understand this game more than Heartstone.This game worth playing if you a little familiar with card games,but if you a new.THIS GONNA BE YOUR HARDEST CHALLENGE,but a pleasure one

Don't listen to the cry babies posting negative reviews.  Most are just salty this isn't a terrible grindstone product like Hearthstone.  This is the cheapest card game on the market.
Everytime I lose, I always find mistakes I made that I can improve on. It never feels like RNG screwed me over.

And everytime I win, I always find mistakes to improve on as well.

This game has endless posibilities, and even though and it needs a bit of balance/rework on certain cards, I'm sure it will grow to stay and be an even better game.

And it's dirt cheap, too.
Its a complex game, with a ton of mecanincs and Dota based theme.
I think it recives a lot of hate for not being casual friendly and the buy price. 
The P2W aspect of the game, its the same as EVERY SINGLE OTHER TCG. Thats the whole point of playing draft modes or arena modes.

Pros:
-Some aspects of Dota are well adpated to a Card/Board Game. (How hero work and respawn, the 3 lanes, itemization)
-Draft Mode is a great mode for people like me that never liked "Constructed" format on TCG.
-Event decks are a nice way to test diferent decks.

Cons:
-Some RNG mechanics are tilting in game defininf momments. (Attack indicators, laning or items)
This game is review-bombed by people who don't understand a thing about economics. After buying Artifact, I've received more money from cards acquired in keeper draft than I spent on purchasing the game. No progression is a wonderful thing as grind systems destroy all relations between time, money and fun in "freemium" f2p games. Artifact's good, buy it.
Game is fun, more than other TCGs (HS/Gwent/ES:L/Eternal/MtGA). Main complaint is monetization, but it isn't that bad. The entry fee can be prohibitive, which sucks. But, I think that it's good that there is no grinding.  Login rewards are annoying and cause inflation in an open economy. Id much rather sell cards I dont use to get the ones I do use. It makes the rewards you do get from event tickets mean more.

What could improve:
- Needs more collectibles / customizable stuff
- Added social features / emotes
- More cards, which will come in time
This is my favorite Card Game to date. Draft is amazing in its current state and I am excited for future updates.  It sounds like cunstructed leaves something to be wanted, but Draft is free and absolutly worth the $20 to buy the game. 


I see the reviews, I hear all the complaints, some valid, some questionable. After playing the game for myself this is what I take from it.

It's a very fun and strategic digital TCG. The RNG in the gameplay is enough to make things exciting but not too much to where you'll feel completely cheated out of a win. The choices you make is overall a bigger factor and much of the RNG can be curved in your favor with good play choices. Draft strongly outweighs the Constructed mode and I see that as a good thing, mainly because you can enjoy the mode FREE after the initial purchase of the game.

Everyone is complaining about the amount of money they have to invest to get much out of this game, and I can see how that could be a valid gripe with the game in terms of playing Constructed. But to be realistic any person who are veterans to MtG shouldn't have much to complain about... making a good Constructed deck cost less compared to MtG.

And to hell with getting mana screwed/flooded! I don't have those problems in this game!
Most of the negative reviews on this game are because people are angry that they have to spend more money than the entry fee to play the game. To be fair, when generalized it sounds pretty bad, however, they fail to address the fact that this type of monetization model is far cheaper than the other games in the same market. This game has more depth than running a deck with a handful of power cards costing $10-$15 dollars each. Those cards while strong are not necessarily a 'always win card', and there are many alternatives that are near that power level. This game allows you to be more creative than limiting yourself to this small pool of cards. Most cards cost around 4 cents to a dollar, and it's not uncommon to build a competitive deck for under $5 - $10 dollars.

With that said Artifact has a ton of depth besides ramming two cards together. It is an ever changing battlefield where luck favors the prepared. There are many strategies that can be deployed where players can alter their 'bad' luck into their advantage. With careful forethought, predictions about your opponent's play, and a sprinkle of luck, each game is an exciting tug-of-war to see who has board advantage.
This game is like most of the games Valve makes. Polished with great graphics, animations and mechanics. Each turn is like a new puzzle with many solutions to it. It unravels in front of you and requires you to solve it the "best" way possible. I believe it has a bright future. Most people that write negative reviews about the game in general, its monetization or anything else havent even tried the game. If you are willing to just try the game out im sure you will understand that all the p2p rumours that everybody is talking about (without having actually played the game) are just NOT TRUE. Here are some 100% true testimonies of people who have actually tried the game :

Bob : "Artifact is awesome! Im a builder in my day job so a friend from work introduced me to this game. From the time i 
           got home i havent stopped playing it"

Sara : " Yea i know.....my parents could have found a not so common name for their daughter. Kids at school always bullied 
             me. Nobody wanted to stay with me for lunch.By the time i got into Artifact beta though ive transformed into a 
             superstar at school. I am also president now for the Artifact cloub with more members in it than the basketball, 
             football and strip clubs combined Artifact changed my life!

Kaiba : " This damn Yugi is also good in other games too (silent f*ck). He came to my company one day out of nowhere.        
               We were having an important meeting with the council members, talking about how to turn 1mil into 100mil in 
               less than 12 hours (in order to break our last record). Anyway, so he shows himself into the room slowly walks 
               towards me and whispers this in my ear. "" Kaiba Yu-gi-oh is done for........Artifact is released in a couple of weeks 
               time"" This damn bastard was right. Thankfully we jumped into the Artifact train fast enough so werent left 
               behind. I personally contacted Gaben and asked for some beta keys. He told us to paint some things 
               first.....dressed as monkeys. He seemed serious about it......so we did. After secretely using "Monster 
              Reborn" on Bob Ross and  had him teach us how to paint (he kept saying it was very ez all the time) we created 
              masterpieces of art and showed Gaben. We took our keys and been practising ever since. Every time im facing 
              Yugi in Artifact its like im living my worst nightmare again. Its a thing called Annihilation......its like im seeing Exodia 
              crushing my soul. My Thunderhide Alpha keeps dying like its made out of paper. Hurts me to admit but i havent 
              even won once against him. Thankfully Joey is still a total noob and i crush him in most of my games!


I don't understand the complaints about the monetization framework for this game. For $20, you get:

- Unlimited phantom drafts (matchmaking, or private drafts with friends + tournaments)
- Unlimited preconstructed + casual constructed matchmaking
- 10 Packs (beyond the basic starter cards and two sample decks)
- 5 Event tickets

You can most certainly freeroll this game past the initial investment, with the exception of Expert Constructed mode (essentially, this is where the tier 1 decks aka 'p2w' lives). Personally, I don't mind this choice, and the initial cost of investment for a competitive deck is much lower than Standard for MTGO and, since I can purchase and sell singles on the market, is seemingly less than the initial investment for Hearthstone (from my experience). 

The game itself from a design perspective has plenty of depth for a newly released digital TCG, and I've been having plenty of fun with it. Time will tell how Valve will approach balancing/features/new sets, so if you are wary just wait it out and see; however, from someone with a varied background of enjoying Magic and Hearthstone both casually and competitively, this scratches an itch that I've had for a long time - a digital card game with a surprising amount of interaction and strategy.
I recommend trying it because the game design is pretty good, but the review I post will be more to highlight things which the Devs could have done differently to make it better:

1. Monetization - on the one hand, it's not expensive... but it's understandable that a lot of people don't like the idea of spending $20 on the game and then additionally having to spend more money on the cards.  At this point, they should drop the $20 cost and also award a ticket for getting 5 wins in the public queues.

2. Queue system - Don't get me wrong, most people will disagree with this but if I were the Dev I 100% would have done this without telling the players:  Combine all of the Draft queues together.  Since you aren't drafting against the opponents anyways, it doesn't matter whether you queued up in an Expert or public game.  Heck, those who queue up in Expert would probably end up with an advantage because they are more likely to take the battle more seriously than someone who just queued up to play a quick battle.   This change would protect against a skewed playerbase that primarily plays one game type or another.

3. Hero Cards - the biggest game design flaw that I can name is actually that Heroes only have one associated card each.  I would have made it 3 cards each.  5 heroes would then cover 45/60 cards meaning that the Heroes that you play would end up having a huge impact upon how the deck plays out.  This would increase the variance between games in Draft, as the heroes used would have more variation, and the variance in Constructed would be easier to shift simply by buffing/nerfing individual Heroes. 

I still think it's the best game design on the market, but if the Devs don't quickly make big changes the game will die.  Even saying this, I still think it is worth giving a try to, because it is different enough of an experience from traditional card games.
Don't listen to the retards giving bad reviews.
These poons clearly take their taste from gamse like Knack 2 and Clicker Heroes where the use of the brain is limited for the pure reason of fun. 
Artifact is not fun. It is a challenge. The best challenge I've faced in a good while. After a mere two games I can physically feel the verge of an aneurysm forming in my brain. So much depth for a card game, so many strategies to be made. A true masterpiece.
TL;DR: Artifact is imho the best digitial card game currently available.

The gameplay is fantastic and has so much depth to it. Skill is more important than meta or luck. There is of course some luck but in the grand sheme of a full mutch there are many little steps to mitigate it with your decision making.

Monetization: Preconstructed and Casual Drafting is 100% free. In Constructed you pay some money for your deck in the marketplace. The prices for individual cards are low and decks are affordable.  Overall in my opinion you get so much more for your money than you get in other games for grinding with your time. 

The calculation TIME vs. MONEY is a personal thing. Decide for yourself. But for me in my current state of life time is much more valuable.

Have fun!
as you can see most the reviews saying the only way to get new cards is to pay real money have not played the game very long. its simply not true. you can win decks and tickets buy playing ecpert game modes.
A really good game! I’ve been playing it for 2 days now and still want to play. This is a good sign.
The only problem is with the economy...
You have to spand so much money to be on the top list of players...
I am really enjoying the game so far.  I'm not sure why there's all this outrage over the pricing model.  I've played Magic, Hearthstone, Hex TCG, Eternal, and other online card games, and this game is by far the cheapest if you want to be competitive.

For the Competitive Constructed Players:
Currently, the three most expensive cards on the marketplace are Axe ($16), Drow Ranger ($10), and Kanna ($7).  All three of which are heroes, so you only need one of each for your entire collection.  From there, the rares rapidly taper off towards the $2-$4 range for the most popular ones.  These prices are as of the first day, and I fully expect these to go even lower in the coming days.  The game only has three tiers of rarity (Common/Uncommon/Rare), so there are no mythic/legendary cards that are artifically inflated in price due to their scarcity.

For the Casual Competitive/Draft Players:
This game has phantom draft gauntlets, in which the entry cost is 1 event ticket ($1) and you draft a deck (Not keeping the cards you draft).  This is extremely useful for those that want to get their feet wet in the game and play for low-stakes while learning the cards.  If $1 is still too rich for your blood, there are also FREE practice phantom drafts, as well as player-run tournaments you can join with your friends if you wanted.  Who doesn't like doing drafts with a few close buds?

For the Kitchen Table Players who are just looking to have fun:
The Uncommons and commons in Artifact are literally pennies to purchase.  The in-game collection makes this easy, showing you prices in real-time and allowing you to filter your collection by cards you own/don't own.  If you are just looking to play with a friend or make some casual fun decks, you could literally collect an entire playset of commons and uncommons for a few pennies.  Even some rares are near that range.

The gameplay and strategy I have found to be rich and rewarding compared to many other card games.  Almost all the games I've played have been close, with many decisions to be made that reward smart plays.  Very few deck types have felt like they are on "auto-pilot" where the deck plays itself.  It's one thing that I have found I really enjoy in this game.  Every decision feels like an important one.

There are other great quality of life things in this game which are cool:
- Played against a sweet deck on the ladder?  The post-game screen allows you to view your opponent's deck and see what they had in case you want to try your hand at it yourself.
- Want to test your deck?  The AI is very competent, and you can even give them a deck made of cards you don't own if you were interested in seeing how your deck fares against a certain archetype.

Overall, this is one of the best TCGs I have played in a long time, and will likely be my new go-to TCG.  Looking forward to the progression system they have talked about as well as seeing the direction that the game goes.

Even if all game had were Phantom Drafts, for $20 its more than worth it. But Artifact currently has TONS more than that. It has event with premade decks, plenty of variety, where you play one of 5-6 precons vs other precons, it has casual/free constructed and free phantom draft, it has cheap marketplace where you can buy cards to build actually competitive decks for $5-$10, it has free to enter tournaments made by various websites literally every day, ... the only thing it does not have yet, but Tweets from Valve say its a priority to implement, is progression of some sort.

I keep reading all the nonsense about having to pay, but for anyone who would normally buy packs in CCG this game is so cheap its unbelievable. I spent $120 so far, might put in another $100, and I have several very competitive decks, type that in something like HS or Arena would have easily cost me triple. I also got back good chunk of what I put in from card sales, I have 212 different cards, multiples of, no Axe/Kanna/Drow, yet, and I turned commons worth less that 5 cents into tickets, so I have 20+ tickets as well, although I used over 10 already in phantom drafts where currently I get back pack every 2-3 runs, so basically I break even.

Plus, Artifact is fun, unique card game. It actually reminds me of complexity some early TCG's tried to implement, but failed to gain traction, like Battletech, Shadowrun and Netrunner TCG's. That by itself makes it not for everyone, and people who will never want to spend any money at all, or who do not enjoy complex 30 minute matches, well, they likely would not have as much fun as I'm having. But, for me, this game is epic level of awesome. Insane production quality. Doggie song is best game music I heard since stuff like Final Fantasy in 90's, cards actually feel like cards, they even have upcoming comic!

Only negatives would be that I dislike, severely, few RNG based card effects, where they either work, or do nothing (and I do not believe such cards have a place in a strategy game) and that I feel that game match duration of 30 minutes can easily be reduced to below 20 minutes simply by speeding up non-essential things and timers. Timers are too long, you should not need more than 15 seconds, maybe 30 in casual, to make a decision, and some in-between steps like creep and hero placement step take easy five times longer than they should.

Anyway, I easily recommend this game.
This is an insanely fun, incredibly balanced trading card game. In my experience most matches end within a turn or two of it going one way or the other. You literally have to consider what lanes to put your heroes, what spells should be used when, and where. You can really dive in and find some interesting complex interactions, that make for interesting builds. (See SirActionSlack's Rix-xy business, or Hostage Situation) 

I understand a lot of people are concerned with the "cost" to play, but honestly you get what you pay for. You get 10 boosters. From there you can decide to build a deck or more with what you have and make the best of it, you can also buy more packs to get rare cards etc, or you can buy cards on the marketplace to fill out builds that you have, but honestly you dont HAVE to spend anything!!!

Just play Phantom Draft. It's free, you get 5 packs to make a temporary build, and see how far it can take you. After losing twice, you restart and try again. 

If you want to up the ante you can play competitive Phantom Draft where you put money on the line, in the form of tickets and card packs, and if you win 3 or more matches before losing twice you can earn tickets and card packs as rewards. Risk and reward.
Gamers' weird attitudes about which ways are "okay" to make money are so twisted and self-contradictory I feel like I'm being gaslighted sometimes. Yes, the game, like all card games before it, is pretty expensive. It also rules.
This game. Is wonderful. The game, is fun, and incredibly indepth and engaging. If you like this, spend money for it. If you don't want to. Don't. I think it's worth the money. This game is beatifully, and lovingly crafted, and I hope and look forward to whats in store. I and many others have waited a long time for it to be released. And it sure as hell was worth the wait. Hopefully, you'll agree as well.

I feel most people's issues with the game are heavily superficial and say nothing about the quality of the game, and more of people's tastes and the infuence of mob mentality.
Coming from HS i was pleasantly surprised to find this game both extremely in depth and very fair with its cards give or take a few (almost) mandatory cards in certain decks, but such is the way of most card games.

I really enjoy the 3 lanes 5v5 hero based gameplay, at first i thought a lot of heroes were rather weak or useless but iv come to see that almost all have there place in decks, and that while there may be meta defining decks as in all such games, the difference between the top tier and the 'jank' beneath is very close, iv beaten decks with all those Axe or Drow or Kanna decks with fun decks using 4 blacks and Rix, iv had success with mono red stall decks trying to bulk up towers till they have 5 armour each. there's so much creativity and fun to be found in the deck builder and while some may find the upfront cost a barrier, if you've ever played any online CCG or paper card game, i don't understand how 20 is such a barrier, it comes with a free drafting mode, which itself is unlimited free play. you can play with bots using all cards, and in all honesty as someone who has spent money 3 times a year on pre-purchasing hearthstone expansions, i have almost a full collection of cards i want on artifact without having to spend nearly as much, and after my purchase they introduced a leveling system that includes free packs. so i say ignore the bad reviews on cost or lack of players, and just play the game for yourself, its a great and creative expression of the card game genre.
This game is awesome. I won't cover the payment model it uses besides single sentence: regular TCG model, nothing unusual or controversial. Game itself is great adaptation of MOBA game into TCG, making it one of a kind in the scope of card games in the market. I played a lot of different card games my entire life beginning with Doomtroopeer or MtG and I find this one very good. It is hard, you need to think on three different levels to not let your opponent kill two of your three towers but manager to do the same to him first (or kill one tower and then the Ancient). Artifact looks like really solid and finished game with it's mechanics so you won't have issue with the balance, but rather with creating the working deck and managing the risk and element of randomness in card draw or creep spawn and of course your opponent tactic. I can't wait till I can see more of my favourite characrers from DotA 2.
Well designed and amazing game that is bogged down by an abysmal monetization strategy.

Edit: With the new update, the monetization system is now a non-issue. I highly recommend this game.
I like this game. In hearthstone you have to play 30 games to open a pack or complete 1 - 2 mission to open 1 pack, but here you can buy it from the market place. saves you a lot of time, but cost money like real card games. I wish they make a history for cards that have been played and increase the pack reward in gauntlet.
8 out of 10 stars 

Still gotta lot of learning to do, but I'm leaving a positive review because the review bombers are shitting up the score.  This game is fun; simple as that.  The monetization is questionable, certainly, but I don't think it's possible to spend more money on this than I did with Hearthstone, so seems fine to me.  

Some of the random elements (deployment, attack direction) annoy me, but I'm not certain they are actually a detriment to the game.  I've always felt like I had opportunities to make plays, but still, losing a couple heroes on round 1 because of things outside your control, and giving your opponent 10 gold right out of the gate feels like absolute shit.  Of course I only experienced that in Draft where I didn't have a lot of choice in low mana position/target manipulators.

All in all, my personal final verdict is still uncertain as I have not played enough; but I know that I can leave a positive review based on what I've seen.  It's a good card game, and the fact that you have three lanes to decide between means you can mitigate some of the RNG losses you recieve.

Probably not recommended for gambling addicts; because I pulled an Axe on my second starter pack and now the itch to pull the slot machine handle is coming back even though I intended just to free draft. (Oh yeah, FREE DRAFT, pretty awesome)
Its a good game, but there are some marketplace issues for SOME PLAYERS. If you like playing 1v1 against friends, there is no reason not to pick it up and play. Competitive decks will require investment past the initial $20, like ALL OTHER POPULAR CCGs (Hearthstone, MTG, etc.). The nice thing is you can typically get a decent % back if you sell, however most players don't understand that part of CCGs anymore. I think its a PC thing rather than the mindset of someone coming from MTG.
Great card game. More complex than Hearthsone but also cheaper. Yes, 20$ for a basic card deck allows you to play in different ways.  I don't understand the critics to Valve. The freemium model with Hearthsone it is relative. 3 expansion each year, that is a lot of cards and money. Even if you play a lot every day, you can't get enough gold, so other people pay. Blizzard is making almost 2 Billion a year for Hearthsone, and that is a lot. 
At least if you dont like the Artifact cards you can sell it. In Heartshone you can't.  I think needs more time, updates, next year  IOS and Android version will be availlable so more people will jump to the game. 
Valve took a risk trying to do something different and I'm happy with that. The more I play the more I like.  Give it a try.
I know it's cool to hate this game, and some of the hate is justified, but I just can't help but adore it. It introduced me to the wonderful world of TCG's, as it's the first TCG I've ever played. And so far, it is my favorite. Artifact is unique, and has such deep gameplay. Even as a video game, it has beautiful visuals, brilliant voice acting, and a wonderful story.

I know the monetization system seems shady, but I genuinely think there's a reason for that (other than "Greedy corporation is greedy"). Unlike other online TCG's I've played, this one is the closest you can get to the physical feel, since you own your cards, and you can buy and sell them, giving you an easy way to build the decks you want to build. Sure, there's no free way to get packs, but if you're good at the game, you can just win them in Prize Play. Even though it costs 1 ticket to enter Prize Play, it also wins you tickets, so technically speaking, if you're good at the game, you can keep winning packs and tickets indefinitely, without paying a single penny.

Yes, it's kinda sh*tty that it's not a free game, but it isn't as bad as people make it out to be. I know it's not Half-Life 3... But that doesn't mean it's not a great game.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok3QdNtHFzc
This is a great card game. 

Personally, I love the RNG elements. It keeps it fresh, if you're good, RNG won't affect your ability. 

People complaining about the microtransactions or card value probably have never bought a pack of magic cards in their life. This is actually probably the closest approximation to a real card game I've seen. Buy in with a deck, buy packs, or buy used cards to build a deck. There's nothing wrong about this. It's not greedy. It's literally how TCG have worked for decades. 

Enjoy the game. It's fun.
its kinda free to play u just have to open packs and sell cards on the market and u will maybe even make money xD i was not that lucky made only 17,50 euro back ... but for 0,40 for unlimited draft forever is good enough i guess xD
Ignore the majority of the negative feedback, these are the result of people not understanding the TCG/CCG pricing format and expecting everything for free after they purchase the game.

This game is excellent, the best online card game out there. If your into cards games don't hesitate and buy this, you won't be disappointed, and if you are, message me with reason and i'll give you $1.
Pretty good game, has alot more depth than someting like hearthstone and the expanaded dota lore is nice aswell. Most of the negative review are all whining about you paying for cards, personaly i think being able to directly buy which card you want is godsend. Instead of oppening random packs until you get all cards you need, you just purchase the specific cards you need. If you dislike paying for cards you are able to play draft infinitelty after purchasing the game. Anyway it's not like you need to pay 50$ for a decent deck anyway and the market prices will most likely settle down a bit lower after a while

TLDR: Really cool card game, dont buy if you are stingy with money and hate drafting
Excellent game. Really enjoyable. Much better economics than the other digital CCG. Don't complain and just play the game. Artifact is priced @ $20 and yes...you could easily spend another $20 or $40 inside the game to complete your decks or to pay for tournaments entry. Compared to the $60 price tag of AAA titles I don't think that this is too much of ivestment. If you don't have the money just don't buy it and move on.
This is a great game. Even if you don't spend more than the initial $20, you can still play infinitely with no downside with draft in either casual draft or draft tournaments that other people host.
I mainly play FPS games and have tired a couple of card games but always seemed to dislike them. but this game for some reason just makes me want to keep playing since im enjoying it a lot what for me is very weird for a game like this! defo give it a try if your thinking about getting it.
The game itself is great and while the game may be expensive to play the ability to buy singles makes it much cheaper when comparing costs with other card games (excluding spending time). Hopefully valve have more to add to the game like progression etc. At the end of the day tho the game itself is great.
I think the price is fair if you just buy the base game and avoid any of the booster packs or paid modes. As soon as you pay Valve a single cent more all bets are off.

Stick to the premade event decks and free draft mode and it's great fun and quite easy to pick up.
So far very happy with the game. Having the ability to direclty buy/sell cards takes this game up a notch. Only thing I am missing is the ability to 1v1 draft with friends.
The review bombs are a bit misleading. There is hardly anything predatory about this game's payment model.

Top tier constructed decks range from $15-$50, you get them by purchasing the singles you need. There is absolutely no reason to purchase an entire collection, but if you wanted to, you could do it for ~$200. This is far cheaper than MTG:A and Hearthstone where a competitive deck might run you double or triple that amount, and forget about getting a complete set. You can also join commons-only lobbies and tournaments, where decks might only cost $2-$3.

In addition, there is a free preconstructed queue where you can pick one of several pre-built decks, and free phantom drafts where you don't keep the cards afterward. This is in addition to "keeper" drafts.

The game is fun, the payment model is great, and it can only get better from here. I can't recommend this game enough.
An incredible game. I used to play a lot of Hearthstone and the $ cost to buy the cards you needs for a competitive ladder deck is much much cheaper than the HS core set. The Armor mechanic really makes the combat feel fleshed out and I have not encountered any RNG that I could not haave played round/abused.

There is a really high level of polish, Hero cards play random voice lines when you hover over them, the board detail is great and your advisor has really nice dynamic emotions.

All in all a great game and just keep in mind the reviews are mad over monetization but it is a far better model than their competitors.
Looks good, plays good and is fun.

I like the difficulty compared to other ccg's

And no poor fags ruining my game experience from salting over expensive decks.
If you don't focus on making your own deck with your own cards and don't focus on playing competitive...you can literally play this to the fullest with every other game mode...thats worth 20$. There's no real point to buying and playing competitive to me. No ranking or progression system etc..Other than it adds an aspect of going to a store and buying into tournaments. I could go on with good ways to buy and sell if you want to make the most of your money but that's not the games fault, it's on you to have the savvy to buy and sell. Anyways, just change your focus and see a different picture. Stop jumping on "credit card" memes like a sheep. Its boring and childish.
I really love artifact and think it is one of the best games I have ever played. I would strongly recommend buying it, as it is a unique card game experience. 
I really like the way the game plays (even though I am expecting new sets as the card pool is currently a bit shallow), and think the monetisation system is pretty well thought and imo less expensive than on other CCG/TCG. 
The main downside of this game is its interface (which is not the game itself, only the way you acess it), as it feels like still in beta compared to other competitive card games : no ladder, no easy to access well advertised competitive events.

Really when I say it is one of the best games I have played, I mean it, it is challenging, nail bitting, amazing!
Best online card game hands down. It is a remarkably rewarding experience for those that spend the time to learn it's nuances. For those that would rather jump right into the best a game has to offer rather than grinding your way up this game is for you. Finally if you decide this game is not for you, sell your cards on the market and just buy another game on steam.
EDIT:  As I've gotten more familiar with the game, the avg game time is now close to 20 mins...which isn't bad.  

This game is not so much pay to win as it's pay to play.  

Valve should have been much clearer in communicating how you obtain cards, and the card market itself.  You can have the best deck in the meta for less than $10.  You could have bought the game full price, bought cards to have 4 highly competitive decks, and still have paid less than what you paid for Fallout 76.

I like the monetization (cheddar stacking) experiment.  You could concievably make money playing this game.  

Original Review::::
(Each game session takes FAR too long to play. )
People are being way too critical of this game in the reviews, if you like card games and a game that makes you think this game is for you. People complaining about the RNG probably just haven't taken the time to learn the game and build their decks accordingly. 

The amount of variables in this game is insane, you have to plan out your line of play for all 3 lanes at once, analyzing what it means for the game's status as a whole. You should always have a plan of which lanes you are prioritizing to win and what's the best cards to play in which lanes to accomplish this. This game really rewards players who can adapt to difficult situations on the fly as often times the optimal plays or lane priorities can change at any moment as each player can make multiple moves per lane before moving to the next. It's a mind game trying to outplay your opponents in the sequencing of plays and passes, calling their bluffs as if it was poker trying to get a read on their hand. 

You need to pay attention to way more variables than any other card game, like how much gold did they spend after the last turn and how many item cards did they obtain? Was their 10 gold spent on 2 items a Blink Dagger + Healing Salve or maybe it was 2 Stonehall Cloaks? Maybe you can do enough damage this turn to force them to use an item so you know for sure?

This game is just beautifully designed from a game play perspective, if you like strategy this is the game for you! I think it's so much better than Hearthstone that I can't even make a comparison. Hearthstone seems so boring and bland, easily predictable and one dimensional in comparison. You just have so many more options in this game, every turn can be so interactive with so many decisions compared to Hearthstone where you just throw down 1 or 2 cards sometimes and you are done. What they have done here is truly revolutionary for Digital Card games. 

Buy this game if you enjoy card games that make you think, a game where it's so easy to make mistakes if you miss one little detail, there is always room to learn and improve. Don't buy this game if you want to just mindlessly play and throw down cards and randomly build decks expecting to destroy all your opponents (seems to be what a lot of the negative reviews expect).

This game gets a 10/10 for fun. You can even play infinite Phantom Draft where you build your own deck of 60 cards from 5 random packs and play against others who did the same. Most games charge money to buy more tickets for this game mode but in Artifact you can do it infinitely for free! That alone is worth $20 in my opinion, it's super fun and you get to experience the game in a more wild unpredictable environment. 

If you are like me and enjoy constructing your own deck this game is also pretty good it seems with just the 10 starter packs. My 10 starter packs were only worth about $6.50 on release day which seems to me like it is below average, meaning I didn't have a lot to work with in terms of value or rare cards. But even with these 10 starter packs (a bunch of cheap cards) I have defeated countless Axe + Drow and Axe + PA decks which are worth $40 or more. Even playing against some of the most expensive decks in the game (around $80 or $90) almost every single time the games are extremely close. 

My point being is that even with a super cheap deck that I constructed with my 10 starter packs I can defeat or put up an incredibly close fight against the top "Pay to Win" decks in the current meta. That being said I did have to really put in a lot thought of how to improve my deck the more games I played trying to continually refine it, so like I said if you like a card game that makes you think this is the one.

There is however 1 bad thing about this game. There is currently no way to progress (gaining new cards) for free other than doing really well in Expert Mode. If they add a way to slowly gain more cards for free by just playing the game I would literally not have a single complaint about this game. Although if you do just want to build a really strong deck it's actually quite cheap compared to other card games... I just personally don't like the feel of "Pay to Win" which is why I'm trying to see how much I can win without paying which has been a lot so far :)
There's no real argument about whether Artifact is a good game - it is. It is the deepest card game out there. Three lanes means a bad opening hand and bad hero deployments are unlikely to, by themselves, lead to a loss. There are so many decision points throughout the game that you are generally not going to lose due to bad draws. If you've put together a good deck and know what you're doing, you have a chance to win in basically every game you play. I've yet to have an unsatisfying matchup, and when I've lost I can point to my own misplays, or to particularly good plays by my opponent (or both).

The biggest disagreement about Artifact is whether the monetization model is a good one, and I think the reason why there's so much disagreement is because for some people, it's very good, and for some people, it's terrible. I love the monetization model because the thing I hated most about f2p card games was the fact that in order to earn enough in-game currency to buy the cards I wanted, I had to play game modes I didn't care for, using decks I didn't care for, at a frequency I didn't care for. I had to play when I didn't want to in order to not miss out on currency.

In Artifact I just use my own money. I can buy whatever cards I want, when I want them. If I only want to play draft, I can do that without worrying about running out of in-game currency. I only play Artifact when I want to play it, and every time I play it, I enjoy it. I don't mind spending more money to keep it this way. That sits fine with me. That may not sit fine with you. If it doesn't, you won't enjoy this game.
Gameplay is the best on the market for a card game. It's struggling right now re:playerbase, but hopefully a ranked ladder will get it back on its feet.
Strategically deep card game that successfully emulates the feel of playing Dota in the actual gameplay. Card prices are rediculous cheap, so you can assemble a mighty collection for about $15. Despite the whiners, balance updates for cards is good for the game overall; just don't think that you can buy cards as an investment. Recognize that they are meant to be played and don't buy it if you don't want it at that price. 

Pros:
-Great gameplay
-Strategically deep
-Bottomed-out card prices
-Innovative game modes

Cons:
-Earning cards is maybe a bit slow
-I've had problems with freezes, but no one else seems to, so it's probably an issue with my computer
-Overall card pool is still a little small, but this should grow with time
Turns out, video games cost money. Who would've thought? Besides, fine with paying 20 bux to keep these reviewers out of the game. Hell, if you can't afford to spend $20 on a game that's a you problem. I groaned at the DotA 2 Card Game, when it was first announced, but I'm three wins in a row and every win is like the greatest gasm in my life. I spent 10 bux on more boosters, sure, but this is a game I want to support and see thrive! And NEVER become free to play!
I love the game, I really do, but it desperately needs a way to get some kind of reward just for playing, the incentive being the game itself isn't enough, I don't want to play social because I don't get anything and I don't want to play expert because of the anxiety I feel when money is on the line, I'm not asking for a pack every day or something like that, give me a "pack piece" everytime I finish the first casual run every day and let me exchange 10 for a pack or something like that so I feel like I'm getting somewhere while I play the game.


As a side note, I have to restart the game after every match because it keeps crashing, it's like a memory leak, the longer I play, the longer the chances of it crashing whenever it transitions to another screen, to reiterate, I love the game a lot and that's why I want it to be so much more, right now it feels like I threw my money just for the sake of it being what it is instead of having bought a game with which I'm having fun and enjoying my time, it's still worth it but I want to make it something I play daily for the rest of it's life, not just that cool idea of a game.
Artifact is realy a unique experience, don't make your mind just by watching a video/stream.
If you like card games you should realy give it a try.

The only reproach that i would make is, at the moment the only way to expand your collection is to pay.
I have no problem with that personally since it's a Trading card game, with the possibility to buy cards on the steam market.
But i can see how this point can repulse players accustumed to a Collecting card game economy.
TCG that actually lets you cash out your cards if you decide later that you are tired of it. The open steam market is going to end up being much cheaper to buy individual cards then the crafting system in comparable games like Hearthstone or Shadowverse. 
The three boards makes it so you can divide resources instead of trying to push back against a stacked opponent's board. I would definetly reccomend to card game enthusaist and to enthusaistic newcomers. The price of $20 entry is going to end up being cheaper then most digital card games over the long run. Fun to learn and the depth is not as overwhelming as it seems.
I'm loving this game and the monitation model is fantastic compared to what came before.

As of writing only 19 cards cost more then a dollar, the median cost of a card is .10$ and every common is going to be perma .05$

considering that decks are in actaully made out of 39 cards(5 heros, 25 non-hero main deck, 9 items) , of which you realisticly grab 1 chase rare hero card and then maybe 9 chase cards, you looking at meta decks being under 100$ while buget decks are going to be 10$, and the price is going to keep droping, ax will not be over 10 dollars forever.

Given that infite draft players must sell cards, give them some time and all the uncommons will reach the same .05 cost as commons currently have and the few chase rares will likely end up costing dollars.

I rember dropping 100$ on hearth stone to try to get the cards for a mill deck and coming up short or watching scrolls grind economy die its slow death, the open economy rewards non-netdeck players with the highest rarity tier costs 2$ for each one compared to heathsones 50$, give the market some time, the inflated prices will drop as netdecks swap around, the to-be infite players finish thier collection and start selling rares blindly.
Great fun. Complaints about monetisation dont account for the fact that real card games cost money. The only thing im dubious on is the tickets but the loss of tickets only keeps you out of one part of the game. Plenty more to play and so far quite cheap to expand decks etc. You can win decks in expert play too. First card game ive bought on pc and its easy to learn. Fun fun.
I'll keep it short and simple. I've played Artifact through its 9 days of Beta and let me just that this is a great freaking game with the monetisation model is actually more than fair.
Every single other game forces you to grind for packs to build decks. They have a complete RNG loot box system that you have to throw your money at to be able to be competitive. 

This game is a TCG and Valve want your cards to retain value. This means, no free packs are given out (You either earn them with wins through expert or you buy them).
Unless you REALLY like brewing decks 24/7, you don't even need all the cards. Hell, with your £16 purchase, you can play casual phantom draft infinitely and still get a new experience everytime. You can pay with your friends for free and also host tournaments for free.

This has the depth, synergy and polish that I would expect from a Valve game. This paid model is actually a lot fairer than most F2P ccg models. At the time of writing a full collection costs $280 (3 of each card exepct heroes) with the common and uncommon set capping only taking $50 (or so). The most expensive rare is Axe at £15 but a lot of the "fun and unique card are below £3. Unless you want to be a completionist with a full collection in under 2 days of Launch, Then I don't know what to say.

Wait about 1-2 week for the prices to drop and get the cards you want to for your imagined deck or just get the full collection (after millions of cards have been collectively opened).

So would I recommned the game ? Let me just say this, I've never been more mentally drained playing a game of arifact than previous games but it makes me want to play more to find more elegant solutions. If you like strategy games, This game is for you 1000%

Very satisfying gameplay. Seems like you are always going to lose one lane, so most often the games becomes a race who can destroy the second tower (often way more protected than the first), which makes for very close and fun games.

Pros:
-Free phantom draft is fun. That's probably going to be my main mode
-Gameplay seems very polished. Only a few cards seem unbalanced
-Game is very easy to pick up, but has plenty of depth

Cons:
-No free progression. Would have been nice to see some rewards for free draft or constructed. At the moment the free constructed seem pointless since you have to buy your own cards. Would be nice to get a free pack a week or so as a reward. It would also give me a reason to buy more cards, cause right now I have no desire to spend more tickets on expert than the ones I got with the purchase.
-No way to communicate with your opponent. Even basic emotes would be fun. I had a lot of good games where I couldn't even compliment the other player.
Artifact is a complex and rewarding card game that does an excellent job at making you feel like you're never truly out of a game, at least most of the time. The monetisation model is fair and the game thankfully does not have some idiotic, artificial grind as many others do. The last thing we needed was another skinner box where you're forced to play the game a certain (most likely boring, unfun) way, or you will need to spend a lot more money than you do in Artifact.

Graphics and animations are slick, Valve is very responsive and overall it's just a really good time. If you've played other true TCGs before and are looking for somehing different than HS and MTGA, this is it.
Amazing TCG. Intriguing mechanics. Skill matters so it will not be enough to copy a cookie cutter deck to win.

I mostly miss a good progression system (ladder, achievements). When they implement it I will go from Hearthostone to this in a more stable manner.

All the hate about microtransactions...
You get 10 packs + 5 tickets for free, which you can exchange for more packs and more tickets again if you are a good player!
You can buy yourself a badass deck for under 3$!
All the bad reviews are just lil kids who cant play the game.
Best Valve Game so far :>
11/10
I know this may be an unpopular opinion, but I love this game I think this game is just loads of pure strategic fun. And to the loads have hate comming torwards this game for being "Pay to win" there's this amazing mode called phantom draft where you build the deck from phantom  packs and compete with other people that also build a deck from 60 cards. Another thing to consider is that it's a damn card game. Every card game in existence a form of packs that you buy at the irl store or a digital store so expecting this to be any differint then MTG or HS is dumb. Also the same issue of pay to win is in HS! Son in conclusion if you enjoy and are good at strategic card games then this game is worth the money. But if you suck or lose a lot your gonna be spending a lot more money on draft tickets then you other wise would if you were actually good at the game. In that case if your that person then don't buy the game.
This is very good card game. People who are complaining in reviews are mostly bobo gago from Dota who are poor... 

Yes... this game you need money to buy cards but the cards are so cheap in market, I spend only a few dollars, not more than 10 dollars total and get over 20+ very good cards. 

Yes, a few cards are expensive like hero Axe, etc but you don't need those cards to win the game bobo putang ina mo. You just need brain and make the deck that suit your playstyle gago yawa! HAGHAHahghaghaghaghghAaghgahgH

If you love MTG, Magic: The Gathering, and HS, Hearthstone, does not quite scratch that complexity itch for you...Then you will love Artifact. this game is by Richard Garfield and the developers of a MOBA. You get a lot of bang for your buck, competition and value all in this game. You get 10 packs for $20. I sold the cards cards I got from the boosters on the Steam Marketplace and the game paid for itself. Theres not much to lose here if you are not simple minded and can handle deplth and complexity in a video game.
This is a fun card game. Please don't listen to the people saying its pay to win etc, I have played the free modes since launch and its really fun.

There is no more RNG in this game than there is in Hearthstone. 

Yes you can do daily quest in Hearthestone to earn gold, but realistically, who doesn't buy new packs when they release a new expac? I no i have spent far more money in Hearthstone than i should have because opening packs is fun.
**[[IF YOU HAVE TO PAY $20!  DON'T!  ITS NOT WORTH $20!!]]**

So i only played one practice match so far and i see a few problems but not the kind that you think would exist.

- This game was clearly made for MOBA players like Dota 2 and League of legends.  Anyone else would be confused as to why there are 3 lanes.
- has a bit of a learning curve, much like Dota 2 and LoL.
- its $20.  idk why its that much. i can see areas to monetize if they really wanted to, but then this game would be a cash grab if any.  So this is the Biggest complaint i have.
- I can see it has balancing issue but keep in mine, I only have one game in my belt.
- games feel like it lasts as long as actual Dota 2 matches.  Take that as you will.
_____

But this game is polished.  Looks nice, feels nice.  Multi-laned card playings an interesting concept if given enough time.  Though i feel like they should decrease the tower HP and add a second tower.

If you got this product free, for a month if I'm reading this correctly, then enjoy it while you can.  I know i am.
Updates will be put below here, if Any.
The base game mechanics are pretty cool, but actual card pool balance is not really ideal, hopefully will change in the future.
(Also, I paid for the game, but I would not mind if it become free to play, so it would be available for more players)
People complaining that a card game that isn't free to play is just being ignant. When the Pokemon/Yugiyoh TCG came out, they costed over 20 dollars for a regular deck, adjusting for inflation and increased cost of living, they wouldve been 50-60 dollars in today's dollar.

Artifact's depth gameplay, mechanics and the additional 10 booster packs with 5 event tickets make up for that 2 times over.
What you guys are comparing Artifact to is absolutely ridiculous. Hearthstone? a dead children's card game where waste 3-5 hours just to grind that "free" 100gold daily. Pretty sure you could buy way more packs with 3-5 hours worth of wage.
Secondly, Hearthstone has no secondary market which means you either have to "dust" the cards to craft the ones you want = buying more packs just to get extra dust/fishing for the card you need.  that just means youre going to spend much more than buying a card off the secondary market Artifact has to offer.

Also Artifact has a F2P Casual phantom draft after your initial purchase of the game. That basically means that you can practice drafting and learning what the cards do, the mechanical interactions between heroes/items/spells/minions/improvements before you try for the expert game mode. which allows you to go "infinite" if you have the level of skill and "luck" required which just equates to getting back your event ticket and hopefully extra packs along the way.

In summary, for all you salt miners out there, git gud or maybe this game just isn't for you.

Definitely recommending a buy to avid card game players. Its WAY cheaper and has a better economy compared to HS/Magic etc.
Best digital card game I've played.  I play all the game modes and they are all fun.  I mainly play standard phantom draft, which requires no additional money beyond getting the game.  160 hours for $20, seems like a good deal to me.  If you like card games and draft in particular, ignore the negative reviews and I'll see you in game.

The fact that you can play Casual arena for free forever makes this game worth it.  The monetization platform is a hell of a lot better than Hearthstone, as you can buy specific cards and not have to wad through RNG bullsht.
As of writing, this game is fun and the payment scheme fair. It's easy enough to buy the cards you want via the market (great interface overall), and it's hardly pay-to-win since there is so much strategy involved. Plays a LOT like Dota 2. Lots of options, lots of strategy, and it really doesn't break the bank unless you're just trying to collect the cards for the fun of it. Highly recommend if you like TCG or want a little more strategy out of it rather than the cards determining fates all of themselves.
Overall Artifact is a fun CCG. The strategy and complexity is on the level of MTG. The monetization is the same as  MTG (you buy packs, tickets or cards), so I don't really see a problem. Also it runs well on Ubuntu Linux 18.04. I think Steam needs to open up the game so that you can install it without any cost, for example to allow you to play in a free tier with a couple of pre-constructed mono color decks against bots or other humans. So that people can try Artifact out without having to pay $20.
People need to understand that by buying the game they still get a lot of content to play with. They can play draft mode, a mode similar to Hearthstone's arena but tailored to Artifact and can play a preconstructed game mode on top of it. Although this may not be enough for some, the gameplay audio and visuals are astounding and leave you feeling gripped and focussed regardless of if you're winning or losing. Additionally, with the market tanking so heavily, if you do want to play constructed you can buy all the cards for a tier 2 deck for less that $10 and even combined with the purchasing cost that is not too expensive. Valve have even added a pack earning system so you can earn some cards by playing. This game is worth a try, seriously.
The game has a negative rep because of being locked by paying for cards, but the business model actually works better for it IMO because the entry level to high level constructed is lower than that of hearthstone, and meme decks being ridiculously cheap in Artifact, in comparison to hearthstone where if you wanted to make a funny deck it would take just as much dust as a seriously strong deck.

Don't let the idea of not being F2P discourage you, there's plenty to do with the initial 20 dollars in free drafts, and drafts with your initial event tickets, and if you really wanna play constructed or you get good rewards you can buy what you want on an extremely cost effective basis.
The first card game that grapped my attention.

Designed by Richard Garfield and developed by Valve, you know will get a good game.
It perfectly combines the more casual feel of a card game with the complexity of Dota 2 that I love so much.
A lot of interesting mechanics make the deck building a lot of fun and the meme potential is enormous.

Outside of the gameplay Artifact offers all cards with voiced lore. Let's be real: In Dota 2 SirActionSlacks was the only one who bothered to read through the big blocks of unformatted hero bios; With Artifact the deep and interesting background stories are finally more accessable and make the game feel more alive.
Here you can also see the time and effort Valve put into the development: When playing a card, the creeps and heroes often make references to the lore and even comment on inconcistencies in the current match.
Then there are the imps: Those little guys will cheer you on during the game and urge you to make the right decisions.

I'm not a big fan of the monetization model and would have loved a Dota-like approach, but I guess we can't get a card game without deck opening.
With the initial purchase, you will recive 10 decks and 5 event tickets. You need the event tickets to participate in expert tournaments that grant prizes, like getting your ticket back (winning 3 before losing 2) or card decks (winning 4-5 before losing 2). 
You won't be able to grind free packs, buying them (2$) and winning expert modes (1$ per ticket) are your only options, and this had me worried.
But luckily you have still plenty of possibilities to enjoy the game:
- Casual Constructed with the cards you already own
- Casual Phantom Draft
- Social Play (challenging a friend with cards you already own, you can also share decks)
- Rotating prebuilt decks (These are made by Valve, but seem to be good and balanced well)
Additionally, Artifact offers a market place to buy and sell cards.

All in all I can really recommend this game.
Loving is so far. I can't give a detailed review just yet. but I'll come back and edit this one.

I think the mechanics of the game are awesome, I think it's quite a steep learning curve, especially for anyone who hasn't playing a card game before.
people aren't thinking clear when they criticize a TCG on having to buy cards
even if some cards are expensive, the prices will probably go down with time - just a question how quick
if you didn't get a deck you find universal enough you can always go for * draft modes - you could potentially play any card ever, but that skips past a lot of people's minds
I don't see any sense in comparing a card game to any other multiplayer game either, like what's the point in rankings that someone else mentioned? it's not always gonna be about your ego, man.
also progression in a card game? that's going to be just how well you're playing - I'm glad that aside from cards there's nothing else that can distract you.

the correct criticism is that they seem to have included a replay system (sometimes the end match screen lags and reveals a text about skipping a replay), but it's not accessible anyhow - i.e. you can't also watch any games, unless you're in a tournament -- that's one part that major sucks
second suckish part is that they could have made the tutorial non-mandatory, and make it optionally a bit longer - if you want to play against AI you need to select a deck. AI's decks can have any cards at all. 
there are premades, but they didn't include the random draft mode for AI for whatever reason.

the game is okay, although I have a feeling in my gut that it's got a bit too much randomness
Best video card game right now. Outclass by far those fake "F2P" games where you have to grind your whole time to get cards you don't even want. First, the gameplay is dope, the environement is also pretty good (board, effect etc). And i'm 100% OK with the economic system and play features. You can't afford some cards for cents or few euros, but you make sure to not miss your weekly McDonalds ? Erf, it says it all. Thanks valve for this master piece
The game is good, if money is no object at all, just get it and enjoy yourself.

As for the monetization, the game gives you a ton of cards, and being able to buy and sell them directly makes building budget decks pretty cheap / easy. For the asking price of $20, I was able to build a budget deck owning almost none of the cards, and a more expensive deck based on some of the rarer cards I got from the starting packs. Both were rated very highly on the deckbuilding site I looked at.

If you're willing to sell some of the rarer cards you get that you don't plan on using, you can easily make at least a deck or two without spending any extra money on the game. If that's good enough for you, then I highly recomment the game. It's worth noting, I've played other CCG's exclusively as a F2P player, and was never able to scrounge up the resources for a somewhat competetive deck.

While I also didn't sink $20 into them like I did for Artifact, I will say that Artifact is, mechanics-wise, much better than every other CCG I've played. Perhaps with the exception of Faeria, but that game's monetization scheme is so much worse than this one's.
This is not only the best trading card game Ive played, but also the cheapest. You have the option of playing for absolutly nothing... In fact my first 10-15 hours of playing I spent nothing! 

Do not listen to the wingers and moaners...... Get this game and enjoy playing....

I rank this this game 10 out of 10.
What the Steam store page for this doesn't say is that you can play Draft mode infinitely for free after buying the game. So you actually have access to all cards in the game after buying the game, which makes the monetization system of this game quite fair actually.

If you want to play with constructed decks then the only way you're going to have a good deck though is putting some money into buying cards. Shouldn't cost much for a good deck though because you can just buy the exact cards you need from other players instead of buying tons of card packs and hoping to get them. You'll save a lot of money.

Personally I prefer Draft way more, so to me this game isn't P2W at all.
Do you want to play a high quality card game? 

Do you want to dive into really in depth strategy? 

Do you want to buy the cards you want to play instead of wasting time grinding out packs that might be filled with trash commons? 

if you answered yes to those questions, buy the game. Too many people are crying because the game isn't F2P. Not every single game can be F2P guys.
Cheaper than competing games on the market, yet with so much depth just the base set offers several venues to victory. The best online card game there is, at the moment
One of the more complicated card-games out there. Be ready to spend some $, but it's worth it. You don't have to spend any money as you get 10 free cards+ cards for every level you get. Very fun and intresting game.
I love this game!  Not sure why all the F2P players are in a huff, after you buy the game you can draft as much as you want for free.  Card prices have dropped so significantly that you can buy the entire set for less than a MtG standard deck.

Not to mention the play is great!  3 battlefields means that my cool niche card is likely to not be a dead play somewhere, and the necessity to win only 2 of the 3 tables, or one table really hard, allows you to move from plan A to B to C fluidly.  Ironically, the game is so complex that I actually decide to not worry about always being "optimal", and it is a fun and relaxing experience.  Maybe I don't win that often, but it's nice to have a card game where I don't have to in order to have fun.

So many Steam games with soundtracks, and this game doesn't have one.  Hope to see it soon because the audio is fantastic.

Keep it up Valve!  :D
Im having fun. At the end of the day thats all i care about.

Also, with future pack releases this game will become more complex and awesome... Complainers gonna complain
Every game of artificat feels like an intense battle of wits, with an amazing feeling of playing for attrition and barely scraping by with every play and victory. It's hard not to get invested in every game and sit on the edge of your seat as your final turns go by. I've never found a game that makes me think harder without being frustratingly impossible than Artifact.

Cost wise, the game is worth much more than it's base price, giving you $25+ of packs and tickets for the initial price of $20, on top of its impressive UI and its feeling of being a finished product. The game comes with plenty of free options of play that don't require you to have good cards. 

The game is complicated when you watch it for the first time, but is actually very easy to get the basics down. However mastering the nuances and optimizing your plays will likely take dedication and many hours played.

Overall I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in playing a new card game, both casually and people looking for competitive play.

Game...... $20
10x Card Packs...... $0
Cost to open Card Pack..... $0

Selling rarest cards and instanly paying off more than half ur game... PRICELESS

There are some things money cant buy, for everything else, theres Lord Gaben

WHERE ARE MY STEAM CARDS BTW!?!?!?
I still play Artifact after 100 hours. I have 8 different decks and do a personal statistic count for each deck. 

If you once have understood how initiative works and you learn how to play around wraths or use them best by yourself its really fun to optimize your play style. You also have to think about the next future turns so the tactical depth is given. A bit RNG is there for sure, but i can live with this aspect, still cool game for me.

Now, where all cards are cheap you can easily buy all you need and enjoy the game for a legit price.
This game will appeal to those who like turn based strategy games.

Don't let the cost of the game deter you. There are enough game modes to try even if you don't want to spend more money to buy packs. I have not bought a single pack and I'm having fun playing casual phantom drafts, call to arms and against the AI. 

So, spending additional money to build constructed decks is not necessary if you don't want to. It is expected that many tournaments will be in the draft format when ownership of cards is not required.

Valve will also be adding so-called progression for those players who need  a reason to play the game.

For me, I play just because it is fun. There is no progression when you gather with friends to play games over the table. The tournament mode allows you to create that experience.

If there is something that I don't like about the game, it is that you need tickets (money) to play expert modes. So, I won't be playing that much at this moment. Paying money to enter a competition where there is prize money at stake is fine but playing money to play a single game will cost too much in the long run unless you are a very good player..
This game is great and all the people complaining have never played a physical TCG or think the hearthstone model is a healthy one. The recent progression update is a much needed one. The nerfs and buffs show they are willing to adapt and shows a big step in the right direction. I thoroughly enjoy the game and being able to earn 15 packs and 15 tickets per season (a few months?) through XP is great. I can confidently recommend this game.
This game is great. it's unfortunate the game has had mixed reviews upon release. I assume Gwent and Hearthstone players use spells on turn two to try and control the board, get mad, and leave bad reviews for this game. I would recommend this to any TCG player and especially all Hearthstone players that don't just play Quest Rogue or Skull of Manari to win 51% of their matches over 1000 games per month.
Stop crying that you have to pay for a game .. 
it is pretty good game and if you are good you can make money , if you are average like me you will be +- on the money you put in ... and if you dont have money you can always play the free mode for fun and getiing better until you grow up and have few dollars to buy few packs or tickets ...
Easily the best card game currently available. You have constantly challenging and meaningful decisions to make and even one small missplay can have a huge impact on the game. That said the game is far from casual and it takes a while to understand what it going on, but it is well worth the effort to dive into. The draft mode is the best game mode and does not cost anything extra to play after you buy the game. There is a lot of RNG, but part of what makes a good player here is manipulating the RNG to your favor. It very rarely feels that RNG decides the game, in the end it boils down to playing your cards as well as possible.
The mechanics are well constructed, it really shows that literally years went into the designing of the game. I particularly enjoyed the thrill of Keeper Drafts and if I have to pay a few dollars to receive hours of endless fun and thrill, then so be it.

8/10
What a great game. Not only is the gameplay strategic, thought provoking, and fresh but it rewards active critical thinking many turns in advance. I love the animations and the voice overs triggered when certain cards are played or items are equipped. 

I also love the market utilization. I was able to buy the cards i needed to make the decks I wanted from teh market for $20. This is unheard of in most card games. I played Hearthstone for years (since Beta actually) and sunk so much time and money into it becasue of teh RNG of oopening packs. Here, if I want a drow, I can go find one on the market for a few bucks. Initially, prices were absurd due to price gouging but now they are super cheap. I am having a blast with Artifact and I can't wait to see what new options are in store for the players.
For someone with over 2000 hours of heartstone/over a decade of MTG experience, this is definitely an excellent CCG. The weaknesses of Hearthstone (strategically simple, very few decisions that aren't obviously the best decision) are not here: the game is strategically complex and I have seen much 'stronger' decks get decimated but superior playing tactics. MTGs weaknesses are also not here: turns never feel laborious or labyrinthine: you simply pass control back and forth.

There are lots of other pros:

-The card set design is simple, but even with a release lacking cool mechanics, this game is still incredibly interesting (this also means that there is a huge amount of room to grow)
-The UI is slick and polished
-Games don't feel too short or too long
-Games tend to be very close, and even when you have a superior draft deck (for instance) you still have a couple critical moments where if you make the wrong decision you can lose - this keeps you on your toes
-You dont need the best cards to win! You need to be a better player...

And a few cons:

-Some of the RNG can be incredibly punishing. It definitely evens out, and usually even over the course of a single match but occasionally you feel like you are WAY behind the 8 ball just by the way the heros are deployed.
-A bit pricey. For a guy who came from MTG with a collection of thousands of cards, I feel like a very modest investment can go a long way in the game

Hearthstone is for the toilet, MTG for in person, and Artifact is my new favorite addiction on the PC.
Amazing game, I used to play Magic the gathering (my favourite), Pokemon and a little bit of Yu Gi Oh when I was a kid and I can say that so far Artifact is at the level of Magic the gathering in quality.
I really enjoy the depth of strategy in Artifact. The game is really challenging and your choices seems to have more impact than in other similar games. The economic model is a bit confusing, but not some atrocity like the kids are all screaming about. I'm happily moving from the Hearthstone grind :)
Most interesting card game out there. Like a mix between DOTA & Chess, extremely polished already at release.

Don't listen to all the brigading, the monetization model is actually much better than games like Hearthstone & MTG where i've spent stupid amounts of money and always felt like i had to do it all over again every time a new set is released.

It's only been a few days and i have already made my initial 20$ back, and have a decent collection already.
Good fresh card game with lots of polish.
Don't mind the initial buying price or the silly negative reviews it's well worth it.
In addition to many other great features Artifact has, there is a COMPLETELY FREE DRAFT MODE!
That alone gets it a thumbs up and worth a recommend.
This game is one of, if not the best TCGs out there. The gameplay is very fun, and has an incredible ammount of strategic depth. Visualy the game also looks amazing, and the imps are entertaining while you are waiting for your turn and also can point out important details you might have missed.

Now for the micro-transactions, i would actually say that they arent that bad, when you buy the game you dont have to spend anything after that, and even if you decide to buy some packs, you get a much bette price than other TCGs considering you get 12 cards with 1 guaranteed rare. you can also use tickets to have a chance of earning even cheaper packs if youre good at the game, wich also adds an element of risk. And if you truly desire a specific card, just buy it from other players.

Overall its a very good game, and it will continue to get updates and expansions wich will make it even better.
Man there's a lot of people who apparently prefer putting 400 hours into a grindfest that doesn't net you a full set than sell steam trading cards to buy cards in this game. I do not understand the idea that it's predatory to give people the opportunity to pay a known price for a specific card, especially compared to buying some number of RNG packs and hoping to get the cards you want/ cards that are valuable in dust but bad in game. 

I put $5 into the steam market and now I have a deck that I'm very much enjoying. As of the time of writing there are only 12 cards that are priced higher than $2. For a complete collection, 6 of them on require you to have 1 copy. Someone did the math yesterday that a full set costs less than $300.

I put $60 into packs every time Eternal (another card game) puts out a new set. I don't always get to build the deck I want after doing so. 

Anyway I'm actually enjoying playing this game, rather than just playing it to get new rewards to play the game how I want to play the game. I like that.
Really fun and interesting core gameplay, supported by a decent economic model.

Despite what some people are saying, you don't need to collect cards to play.

Cards aren't given away at all, but unlimited play is possible in casual phantom draft.
Paying more than the base price is necessary to expand the collection, but I never felt forced to do it, as draft matches are more interesting to me than constructed.

If you are however interested in expanding your collection, you will be expected to either buy packs, or individual cards on the community market. Most cards have a very decent market price, the most expensive one being Axe at the time of writing, for about $20. This makes artifact a very interesting TCG, you can get most if not all cards for a very decent deck for a relatively low price, compared to other games.

I would recommend this game, unless you prefer grinding a lot for your cards, which isn't possible in Artifact. Then again, draft is in my opinion the more interesting game mode, in which the card collection is irrelevant anyway.

Also, keep in mind that this game feels very empty at the moment. There's plenty to keep playing, but it isn't a game for everyone.
Love the drafts so far (played free drafts only while I am learning). Constructed felt weird but that's to be expected with one released set of cards so far.

Be advised not to buy it, though, if you are tight on the money. Game economy is similar to MTG - [h1]you have to invest if you want to be [b]DECENT[/b] player.[/h1] Casuals may enjoy the game for it's basic cost with tournaments, drafts and constructed (you still have to invest but much lower).

Remember: there's only a pay gap if you want to go further than just casual play. It's not pay to win, it's just how such games work.
It's a well-made game, complex enough to sink your teeth into but accessible enough to enjoy early games.

The range of strategies is amazing, it's definitely not a rock-paper-scissors type situation.

Everyone talks about the price, I think that's pretty silly. Prices are dropping rapidly for most cards, total cost to buy every single card in the game is < $300. There's only 12 cards above $2.00 at the moment. I don't understand why people think that content should be free. Completely possible to play the game fully and easily without spending any more than the purchase price.
It sure needs a lot of work but the game is nice and interesting. Apart from the initial cost for buying it, I don't consider the game expensive and I'm dirty cheap. 
You can buy the cards you want from money you made from other steam game trading cards or skins you don't want etc. Whereas on let's say Hearthstone you have to either grind packs till you die or buy packs till your bank is empty hoping that the cards you want will be on the next pack you open...or the next after that...or...

I've spent like 20 cents on cards, I don't own any of the big/expensive bois and still doing OK against others. Hell, I even made ~5€ from it (though it was on the early days when the cards cost more.).

Anyway, I feel like this game worth it.
This game is a lot of fun. The 3 lane mechanic makes gives it a nice MOBA touch to a TCG. Graphics, artwork, and mechanics are great. 

The RNG in the game is there but it you know where it will be before hand so it can be (mostly) played around with skill unlike most other TCG/CCGs. This makes the game require more skill than luck than we are used to.

For those complaining about p2p, there is an equivalent casual mode for constructed and draft, as well as a rotating featured mode which are completely free for those who ran out of their tickets or want to practice before going into expert modes.
People writing bad reviews and pay to win need to realize you can play draft for free forever and not spend a penny. If you really want to play constructed this game is about $200 cheaper to play than Magic the Gathering (The actual card game...you know the one that has been successful for two and a half decades). People need to get over it.
The gameplay is great. RNG is a thing but it's forseeable and managable. 

The economy is blantant in what it is, while it is a requirement to buy cards you can purchase the exact cards you need for your decks without trying to RNG them through packs. A full collection of the base set is $100, cheaper than the majority of other digital card games.

Don't go to the Artifact reddit, it's literal aids.
Probably the best strategy game out.  Makes Hearthstone look like childs play.... This is a HARDCORE... Yet Easy to learn.. Impossible to master. (just watch the "best top decks" constantly changing on websites)

Just buy it.... If you do not like the game... Or you are worried you will have to buy more cards....  Guess what.. You know what you are going to get into here. Its a card game. And you need to purchase more packs. Its 2 dollars a pack people.  

You ALSO have the opportunity to make money.  So oh no you don't like it? Its a scam?  Didnt pay attention to what you bought here?  THEN SELL THE CARDS AND MAKE MORE THEN THE GAME IS WORTH. IT IS A SIMPLE CLICK OF A BUTTON LITTERALLY INTEGRATED INTO THE GAME FOR EASE OF ACCESS.. WOWZAS AM I LIVING IN CRAZY TOWN HERE?

Seriously though? Mad easy to make money. Mad easy to sell cards. Mad easy to buy cards. Mad easy to have fun. Mad easy to get mad becase your red black POWERHOUSE deck just got stomped by a solid blue??? WHAT???? IM MAKING A NEW DECK DAMNIT....   ALL SPELLS WITH A DASH OF GREEN!!! No..... Ill be back.. I need to think
So much more strategy and decision making in this game vs other TCGs.  Almost every game has plays that you can remember which if you played differently you could have won.
Best CCG I ever played. 

Not without its flaws but this is such a polished gem, comes with many game modes & features. Enough stuff to keep anyone in solid gameplay, whether they be hardcore & willing to spend some $ on cards & decks or just want to do the casual & social game tiers, which cost nothing, other than the up-front purchase price.

I gladly pay for this gaming experience over the F2P skinnerware (some of which I am a fan of, too).
Great mechanics and gameplay. Gameplay feels more rewarding than other card games (finished high legend in hearthstone and played years of Yugioh/MTG). Some problem cards that need nerfs, but if you stick to draft until then and learn the game it is well worth it.
$20 entry basically. $20 for 10 packs, which you get 10 of on purchase. 

Purchase also gives you 5 Event Tickets, which are used to enter Game Modes that are not Normal Play. These tickets cost $5 a piece, and the $20 entry fee is basically giving you 5 tickets for free. You *can* keep your ticket you used if you win 3 matches in the mode before you lose twice. You also gain more if you win 4/5 matches.

Card economy is skewed atm due to release. Some cards are great and cheap, some costly and decent. Sell the costly ones now if you think you don't want them and gain a profit from it, they'll drop in price later. (Drow dropped a couple dollars already and it has been barely a day since I sold mine).

Interesting concept for a card game, play 3 boards at once. I enjoy it so far, 8 matches played.
Great core card mechanics. The 3 board system is really good, and really fun, BUT, the monetization they implemented is awful. The fact that there is no physical way to earn cards, and the only way is to buy packs or buy each card individually for real money, is the only problem with this game. Dont buy this unless they rework this terrible cashgrab part, then it will be fantastic.

Edit: No, i was wrong entirely. Im okay with the monetization, because unlike every other card game, you can actually spend your money on a specific deck or one specific card instead of opening countless ammounts of packs trying to make one deck good. Im alright with this now
I have been playing card games ever since the early days of Magic:The Gathering. It has been a very long time since I have experienced a game that has truly innovated the genre as Artifact has done. The game is very fun, complex, and can be extremely rewarding if you stick with it.
I'm not one to write reviews normally, and I don't really intend to here either. Watch streams and try out the game for yourself to form an opinion on it. The purpose of this review is to leave a positive reccomendation for Aritfact. I personally love the game and the intensity it offers in draft mode, it's everything I could want in terms of gameplay. When it comes to the monetization model - all I have to say is get over it. It doesn't matter if it is a CCG or a TCG, IRL or digital, they all require money to play competively. This is what Artifact is, a competitive TCG. If you don't like it, go ahead and try to change it, or not. I for one and fine with it as I'm sure many others are. Even then, Artifact doesn't require much beyond the initial $20 purchase to play as much as you like. Free community draft tournaments, free phantom draft (more casual), and then the intial 5 tickets for the expert draft are plently enough. If you study up on the game and do some casual drafts before hand, it's really not too difficult to get more event tickets for free. Alternatively, you can spend an extra $20 on event tickets, and go infinite with good play from there. 

TL;DR: Artifact is a game for people who want a competitive experience. With a small paywall, time invested into studying will ultimately pay out and allow you to play "for free."
Undoubtedly it's a good game, funny and full of strategy. The only complain for me is there's no way collecting cards for free and everyone knows these cards are not be created equally.
I wish Valve can update a big version asap, adding some functions like GG, ranks, maybe some untradable cards for playing well. 
Most important thing, is there anything extra for pre-ordered players? skins? cards?
Sure, you "have to" buy cards with real money if you want to build constructed decks, but it's a solid game that doesn't try to trap you with daily quests or other Skinner boxes. I like playing games because they're fun, not out of a daily obligation to progress, and Artifact excels at that.
I am a Magic: The Gathering player with a few competitive accomplishments like a Pro Tour invite and a few GP/SCG top 64s. I've had some success in Eternal with an Invitational victory and several weekly top 8s.

Artifact is the deepest and most strategic card game I've ever played. The average number of relevant options given to you in a single game is much higher than a game of Hearthstone, Magic, or Eternal. The RNG doesnt feel like it disrupts the outcome of the game like in Hearthstone, but instead keeps things fresh causing new scenarios in every game to solve. 

The game is so much more accessible than people give it credit for. A complete collection is currently costed at less than $200, which is incredibly cheap compared to every other cards on the market, digital and physical. Competitive constructed decks are less $50. Even if you dont want to shell out for a constructed deck, you can draft for free as much as you want, or for prizes for just a single $1 entry ticket (which the game includes 5 on purchase). You can also turn any 20 cards into 1 ticket, which lets you have a use for your random commons that sell for nothing. 

For those who's only option is to play F2P games and grind for cards, this is probably not for you. However, for those who value their time and money value, this game is the easiest and cheapest to get in to compared to any other digital card game.
Don't listen to the haters , the game is amazing and you can get most of the cards for cents. Yes few overpriced good cards but there are many cheaper alternatives that are just as good.
TLDR: This game will appeal to those who enjoy turn-based strategy, or long time Magic the Gathering fans. This is the best strategy game I have played, in all genres. The game is unforgiving with errors but wins for smart play are highly rewarding.

This is only the second review of a steam game I have written after 10+ years on the platform. As a longtime (Tempest block) MTG fan, I was thrilled with Arena when it came out, and thought just for fun I would give Artifact a try. Only 20 bucks, free draft, why not? Well 220 hours later I can honestly say this is the best game strategy game I have played, in all genres. 

Most of my time has been spent in draft mode, which was also my favorite format in MTG. This format allows for a new experience every game, and with all colors and a majority of the cards being playable, drafting and tuning the deck is nearly as much fun as piloting it. Constructed is also currently fun, even with just the base set. The meta is still shifting, but there are at least 4-5 competitive builds right now.

My review will mostly address the negative reviews as the appear so frequently, namely cost, randomness, not being fun: 

The cost is only prohibitive if you intend to buy the game and purchase every card, don't do that. Buy the base game, play against the bots without a timer to learn the game, then play the Call to Arms event decks to learn the cards. Then free phantom draft to hone your understanding; this whole experience will take you 40+ hours and will have cost you $20. If you then feel the game is worth it you can purchase the cards to make a couple constructed decks.

The events that are randomized in this game are numerious, dozens to hundreds over the course of the game. This can be jarring at first and it easy to blame the loss on the last random event of the game, but it is the randomness that occurs throughout the game that give the players an edge to interact with the game state and make the overall game interesting.

As to it not being fun, this game is not going to appeal to everyone, I think alot of people tried this because it was the first Valve game in years and they were interested. It is a deep turn based strategy game with dozens of decision points over the course of a game, any one of which could lead to you losing or winning eventually. You need to know most of the cards in the set before it starts to click as well as the core gameplay and nuanced mechanics of hero deployments. The first few play throughs feel like you don't much control over the game, just playing cards out of your hand. Knowing when to defend and abandon a lane, when hold intiative, to hold back cards in your hand, letting your heroes die or the enemy heroes live, all take many hours of gameplay to understand, and it is mastering these aspects of the game that are for me the most enjoyable.

edit: grammar and spelling.
Artifact is an excellent card game with absolutely no skinner boxes. 

You can play endless draft/limited mode (the games go to playstyle) for absolutely no cost other than the purchase price.

Everything is laid out for you in black and white in terms of costing if you decide to purchase a constructed deck. And you don't need to endlessly open packs hoping to get what you want, you can just outright buy what you need from the marketplace.

The gameplay is excellent, with a deep and interesting battle mechanic. I'm hoping for more complicated and involved cards in the later expansions, because the base set is quite vanilla, but Artifact is an excellent platform. 

Gameplay is fantastic.

You can just buy the cards you need from the Marketplace without having to buy any packs which is WAY cheaper.  Commons, Uncommons, and Rares ranged from roughly 0.05 cents - $2.50 with some exceptions.

Complaints about price holds little weight.
It's a good card game.  The whiners don't seem to get the model which has been around forever in ever trading card game ever.  It's more like a tradional TCG, where you use your own cards that you buy/trade and you can't play the game to "create cards".
Artifact is great.  If you think it's too expensive, then fine, whatever, but remember you can PHANTOM DRAFT FOR FREE.  If you can't get $20 worth of entertainment that way, then I'm not sure what to tell you.  A full constructed deck costs about what would be reasonable to just include in the price if they gave it to you.  

The game is simply incredible and will only get better.  It's so new and refreshing to play something that isn't just 75% Magic.
Best card game ever made. Best gameplay in any card game period. People will complain about difficulty getting cards for free but thats because they suck at the game. If you have skill you can get infinite packs and tickets from phantom draft so yu can ignore all the crybabies lol. Ive played nearly every card game digital and real for the past 22 years. 32 if you count normal playing cards. This game is by far the best of them all.
Wonderful game i love it , call to arms cards is free to play not need buy very very good , graphics is perfect , sound very good , gameplay is very fun and balanced , cards can be selled on steam market this is very important because the game rewards the player that play with it so people poor can make little wallet steam funds profit with it , 10/10 for me.
So, I am an IRL TCG player, mostly play Yu-Gi-Oh, but have been going to a bunch of Magic: the Gathering Booster Drafts, there are 2 things I want to say:

1. "This game is P2W". - Artifact tries to be as close to real life TCG as possible, hence why the main way to get cards is buying boosters and/or cards directly. I haven't checked for trading, and if that is a live feature, even better, if not, maybe it will be something that will be introduced at later times.

Considering you need to pay an entrence fee at most IRL TCG tournaments, even if it's something small like a Booster Draft, the game offers you from the get go it's money back via the free packs, free tickets and the Dota+ 1 month sub, further using tickets as the entrance fee for game modes where you get rewards. Rewards (for now) being more tickets and card packs. I am not sure how the rewarding works, but if my guess is correct, you can end up with with 3 tickets and a good bunch of card packs, making your ticket balance on +2 by winning 5 games, while if it's wrong, you can get a 0 balance difference in your tickets and just free cards by winning 4 out of 5 games, which is still a lot, since you can use the new ticket to play again while no IRL tournament be like "hey, you won a few matches, here's you're entry fee back and some free cards on top of it". If you only win 3, you get your ticket back, no extra cards, but you can play again at no extra cost.

Bonus point: You can turn any random 20 cards into a ticket.

Getting nothing for losing is well, sad, but most tournaments where you go with your own cards and just pay an entrance fee give you nothing in return if you lose. Yes, big Yu-Gi-Oh tournaments will give you some booster packs, but (haven't tried, so it's all speculation here) the game mode where you pay 2 tickets will give you 5 boosters after it's over, be it win or loss, so there's that, which is even better than the Yu-Gi-Oh ones, as 5 boosters have a higher price, even if not by much, than 2 tickets (that's not even counting the tickets you can make from spare cards from those boosters), as all Yu-Gi-Oh and MtG participation rewards are boosters that sum up to your entrace fee, no more no less. Can't say more about this game mode as I haven't tried it yet.

2. "Whales have better cards than me since I don't want to spend". - I'm sorry your feelings got hurt, but that's life. As stated above, Artifact tries to be as much as possible an IRL TCG, and in those, of course players with bigger pockets will have better cards. Deal with it. Around 4-5 years ago, when the Nekroz archetype got released in Yu-Gi-Oh, Nekroz of Brionac costed 150$ on secondary market per copy, and you needed 3 to play the damn deck, or at least 2. Could you play other cheaper decks that were of similar power to Nekroz? Sure, Shaddolls and Burning Abyss, 2 archetypes released at the same time were good alternatives, but even those were a tad weaker than Nekroz, meaning even tho would have a fair chance at winning, Nekroz decks were still the favore.

2 years ago, when Pot of Avarice what released, it was the most polarizing card, called the "best card in the game" by players who were either lucky to draw a playset or afforded to buy it, and "trash card" by those who couldn't, and it was extremely powerful, being, at the time, used in almost every deck that could top something and if you weren't using it yourself, you were on quite the disadvantage, unless you were running a deck that simply couldn't run it.

Such cards get released even now, with Ash Blossom & Joyous Spring last year and some of the Sky Striker cards this year.


TL:DR - The game wants to simulate real TCG that you play IRL, so it plays like one, stop comparing it to the online ones where you get cards for free almost every log in. Yes, it's a cool game and more casual players would benefit from a few free cards (me being one of them, I got the game gifted to me by a friend who knows I'm deep into TCG), but that doesn't mean the game is dying or what not because it doesn't play like an online TCG.
This is a good game with a lot of potential. Don't let the sour-grape parent-basement-dwellers fool you into thinking that it is either 1) too expensive or 2) not worth the expense. As a teenager I shelled out hundreds of dollars for Magic cards while working weekends at a movie theatre. I didn't whine about how expensive they were. I just cared about whether it was fun or not. That's what you should care about too: is it a good enough game to be worth your money? 

I can't tell you if it is worth the money, because I don't know your budget. All my review can do is tell you a little about the game and whether it is the kind of game that you might like. After that, it's up to you to look at the price, determine if it fits your budget, and then decide if it is worth the money or not. Any reviewer that claims to know otherwise is wrong.

So, about the game itself then:

Artifact is a good card game. I enjoyed it more than Hearthstone, and I could see it becoming as good as Magic was. If you like Hearthstone but miss Magic, then you'll likely feel the same way. Although the graphics are bland and the theme isn't compelling, the gameplay itself has the same kind of synergistic depth of strategy and tactics that you just can't find anymore.

The game basically revolves around two things: the 3 towers and the 5 heroes. You try to kill your opponents heroes, and they try to kill yours. And all throughout, you're trying to take out 2 towers. There are 'creeps' (creatures) that you can summon. There are buffs/nerfs for your heroes and creeps in the form of spells. There are global buffs/nerfs that you can attach to your towers. And there is a box of buffs that you buy in between each turn (with gold you gain from killing heroes and creeps). Almost all my games were very close, and even the ones that weren't close *felt* close (if I had just done something different). Don't worry about your heroes dying, because they always come back, and how/when/where they come back is all part of the fun.

It's actually pretty straightforward in terms of mechanics. You can play casually for fun, with themed decks that are just fun to experiment with, or competitively with highly optimized decks that require an insane amount of disciplined play. If I had to sum the game up, I'd say that if Hearthstone is the light beer of card games, then Artifact is the best contender for steak and whiskey. It isn't quite there yet, but with a large enough community and ongoing updates, I have no doubt that it will become a classic. Even in the face of ideological opposition to good developers making good money for their good work.

Spent the first day playing non stop 9 hours in one day right out of work. Amazing experience
No "Griding For Cards" you can just buy them on the Steam Market.
"But but i dont want to spend money"
When the hell did you become entitled to get every thing in games for free. If you come from hearthstone and complain about $20 to get the started. READ FUKN READ. You are pretty much buying 10 Packs which are $2 each, as well as a set of 5 Tickets that you can use to enter the draft modes.
"But why do i have to use tickets to play a game mode, WTF VALVE P2P"
No, do some research.
You have the option of Paying to draft, you enter with 1 ticket as long as you get 3 wins you will get your ticket back, if you get 4+ u also get packs.
But if you dont want to pay to draft, its understandable. You have a free mode to Draft and play with other people as well.
You pretty much buy the game, and you dont even have4 to worry about having cards if you really dont want to spend any money at all. The free draft exists, you also have Events that rotate in and out, which give you at least 5 different types of decks that you can play with against other people.

Anyways End RANT
VALVE you did amazing with this TCG and im actually excited to see  what this base game brings in the future

9/10
Most important: 95% of the player reviews are saying that the game is P2W. Searching for decks for 5 minutes I could quickly see competitive decks that could be bought for 2-3 dolars. This means that for less than 10 dolars you can buy at least 3 competitive decks and have enough fun for a long time. If you buy a game for approximately 20 dolars I imagina that 2 dolars for at least 1 deck wouldn't be that painful, right?

I read reviews for 20 days before buying the game and almost didn't buy it, now I am kinda regretful for not buying it before although I have only a few hours played.

I've already played other card games and there is no better and worst because each one has it is own particularity. What I would say is that you must choose the game that fits better your playstyle, time available, etc.

The game is not so complex as it looks like from other reviews if you already played a card game before or have 45 minutes to learn the mechanics of the game. It is even better if you also played/play dota2 as well.

I strongly recommend it and hope that the playerbase increase in the next weeks. I don't know if it is going to happen but I wish it gets more populated soon.
An interesting card game. Plays alright.

WARNING TO THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH CARD GAMES:
If you want to play with more cards you have to pay for them. Outlandish isn't?
The only negative is that you cannot trade cards.
Amazing game. A lot of people complain about the price, but like a good meal at a resteraunt it is totally worth it.

If you are feeling unsure because of the reviews, do you own research.

This game is not a F2P grindfest and that might put some people off but it is the cheapest TCG on the market, has a ton of depth and strategy and has big tournaments planned backed by a game that can back it up.

The learning curve seem steep to begin with but it doesnt take long to figure out once you actually get into it.
Game, gameplay, and mechanics are top notch along with graphics and presentation. The main complaint you will hear is the monezation model, but they are not giving you the full story. Yes, the only way to earn cards is by buying them, but no just from packs. There is the in-game market where you can buy cards, and a full collection is $250-$300. This is a huge improvement form models in similar games where you can spend the same and still not come across a full collection.

Next complaint would be the "Pay2Pay" model. Yes, all events that you can earn packs in cost 1 event ticket ($1) to enter, but all other modes are free to enjoy including a "phantom draft" where you can play draft but not keep cards. Almost no other card game out there offers unlimited free draft, so this pays the price of admission on its own. 

If you are wiling to invest beyond the initial $20 purchase, this is potentially the best digital card game on the market.
It is fun to play with friends. If you want to play competitive you (probably) need to spend soem cash.

There are ways to get cards for free and also game modes with predesigned decks.

There is a arena ("gauntlet") which you need tickets for. You get 5 for free the first time. There you can play with temporary drafted decks (so nobody can pay to win here). Wins bring you stuff:

3 wins, 1 ticket
4 wins, 1 ticket, 1 booster
5 wins, 1 ticket, 2 booster

There are two other arena modes, one where you play with your own deck.

If you keep winning with your free tickets, you _could_ get all cards for free. But it is moer likely you will need to spend some cash if you want the best meta deck.

Most cards are under few euros, most are even under 10 cents. There also some over 10 euros.

I actually made more cash from this game as I spent for it but I also spent this cash on new booster and some cards.

All in all: 
+ It's fun
+ It's p2w if you want to play tournaments
+ There are some ways to get cards for free
++ Phantom Drafting is Free, for that alone it is worth $20, as replay value increases significantly (MTGO, Hearthstone, not free unless you can go infinite)
+ Strategy seems to matter, gives the gameplay some depth so its less grindy.
+ Theres a tournament mode that is free (with phantom drafting, 4 players or more, hopefully that goes down to 1v1)

+- Pay to win in consturcted but to be honest with the steam market and patience you can probably get a full set of cards or specific decks for very cheap. I haven't played any constructed yet to be honest and I doubt I will, I'm hooked on the free phantom drafting.

- No Mulligan?
- Card Balance is off, Red is bonkers OP
Fkin fantastic game, why do people expect a TCG to be free? yes its not FT2 but u can most definately play with the basic sets, there is no overpowered set.
i did wish there were more cosmetics tho, like gold cards, and i wish we had some daily quests.
But that aside let me be clear ladies and gentlemen, THIS IS A REAL TCG that is extremely balanced.
This game gets a lot of deserved hate. 

It's a good game, and I hope Valve fixes all the problems everyone keeps repeating in the discussions group. 

Currently, I would avoid. Not much to do in the game, wait for a bit and check it out later.
Fun game and very different from most card games. You can say that Artifact is a strategy game that uses cards more so than a card game that has strategy. 

Also there's lots to play for the Base cost of $20, Phantom Drafts, Event decks with leader boards, Pauper auto join Tournaments and Pauper and Peasant constructed. If you don't feel like putting anymore money into the game, you can sell the rares you get from the 10 packs that come with the game and buy a full collection of common cards for Pauper play, and maybe have enough to buy many uncommon for Peasant matches. 

The game not perfect, but Valve is commited to the game and there are lots of updates planned to add in features. 

Progession update comming this week, for example 12/18/18
Many people have been giving this game poor reviews for a variety of reasons, however the reason I'm recomending this game is because its refreshingly new and enjoyable gameplay. At launch Valve seemed to want to take the game in a direction the community didn't support, however with the kick back Valve decided to change that. Afer listening to the community they are now making steps into the right direction, so the games future looks good. The game itself also has so much replayability with gamemodes like phantom draft to get over the initial lacking of cards. I have played Magic The Gathering Hearthstone and many other online and offline card games, none of them seem to measure up to Artifact in the same way. Tournaments also allow a replayable more common serious option rather than the normal grinding of pubs like in games like hearthstone. If you enjoy get rewarded for preparing ur deck and moves ahead of time, making new and strange decks, not forced to meta gameplay, and not losing solely because the person paid more money, in my honest opinion Artifact is your game with the different gamemodes and options it allows.
This is by far the best DIGITAL Card Game, visually it is the best of all, amazing art, amazing animations, gameplay is so depth and so simple at the same time that makes every match quite interesting. I'm sure THIS IS NOT A CASUAL CARD GAME and in no way it's a game FOR DOTA players. Kids are crying about business model, but that's just because they don't know that in real life card games has almost this same business model, also the "Free to play" era brainwashed a lot of kids and nowadays if game isn't free they will tauntrum till death. But leaving aside the business model (which to be honest fits perfectly):
Visuals 10/10
Gameplay 10/10
Game modes 9/10
Music and Sound 10/10
Market 9/10
Price 9/10
Absolutely amazing game. pricing is a bit wack, but it matches you against other people with similiar deck level to you so while you won't win any tournaments you'll still have a lot of fun. Plus with the chat wheel for every single card coming out right after release makes me think there are a lot of features that are 80-90% done but aren't Valve ready so they chopped up the release rather than delaying.

It is the Dota of card games, so many ridiciolous op shit but it all intertwines beautifully leading to epic matches that you get by by the skin of your teeth. So many misplays noticed right after, just like Dota, but just gotta put my head down and learn humbly as I once did with Dota. Give it a shot, you could be playing it for the next 10 years.
You get the game for 18€, and then get, on average, like 10€ in cards and 5 free tickets. Even if you don't enjoy the game, you got it pretty much for free.
Any other card game costs 50x the price of Artifact. Just because cards are on market and you can see all the costs does not mean the game is actually expensive. It is not.
Draft and casual play are all FREE. You have 5 tickets for drafts which are really not too hard to spin a few times if you get some wins.
The game is very difficult and the games are long. If you want a casual game, this is not for you.
Very good game for the value and will likely get better. Can recommend.
All the 12 yr olds without jobs who say Artifact is p2w shouldn't even be using their mom's credit card to get the game in the first place. Refund and go back to fortnite, don't want none of that trash in my games.

Best PC TCG hands down. Monetization is fair and better than other titles. Gameplay is deep and options are plentiful. Feels as if any game lost, you could've won had oyu taken a diffferent line.

The closest thing to the depth of MTG that isn't.

Buy.
Ignore the people crying about having to pay for cards in a trading card game. The game is great, and yes it does invite you to buy more packs, or play casual drafts, or play with friends, along with many more options.
(BETA TESTER)

This newest iteration from Valve is simply phenomenal. Leave it to volvo to redifine genres yet again. This is unlike any card game I have ever played before, and it's amazing. The skill ceiling is incredibly high, the randomness of this game is neglegible next to the skill factor. Something card games have struggled to balance for years. I recommend this game with my whole being. It is my favorite card game and one of my favorite video games. I think in its infancy for it to be this good, is an accomplishment. I'm very prowed to be able to watch it grow and I believe it has the potential to surpass the great card games.

EDIT: PSA to all the people leaving negative reviews because of price:
First of all, you all clearly have never played a trading card game before, this is not out of the ordinary at all. This is on the cheaper side of a trading card game, you can buy the entire set for like a few hundred bucks. In magic you would need to spend close to or over 1000. This game was not made for gamers who are entilted and do not understand how card games work. If you can't afford this game then play something else.
People say this card game is p2w, I think its an awesome concept, only that unlike real life card games this is virtual so all cards will end up much cheaper than they cost atm, enjoy trying to learn the game and try to employ strategies responding to the type of enemy you seem to be facing and you'll have a lot of fun, I am currently playing blue/black with Luna 0.12$, PA 0.08$, Bounty 0.05$, Venomancer 0.03$ and Debbi Free?!? so my heros cost not much, now the 40 playing cards and 9+ items are gonna cost a little more, but you can clearly see how you can play with 3-5$ of gear and still win and have fun games.

I think the game is great but also think the idea of this being like a real life card game is the failing, unless there is something to make this drow I have randomed but dont use unique above newer bought cards, this game will get X$ instead of X*1.05/y$, I dont know if that maths makes mathematical sence but I like it.

Game gets 9/10 from me.
Great game, ignore the spam-hate reviews from people that neither understand this game or how CCGs even work. The 20$ buyin got me cards immediately useable and tradeable and without any super rares my 10 packs were worth as much on the market place as my initial buyin so I lost nothing in the deal. This game is nothing like hearthstone or mtg: arena. I enjoy those games but got tired of the standard tried and true formula they follow. 
If your into trying out a brilliant new system then this is well worth it. If the initial buyin worries you, dont let it, you can sell your cards back and basically have spent nothing by the time your done with this game. Finally if all the hate-reviews are putting you off, ignore them completely. This game is very very enjoyable!
I feel like i need to post a positive review since so many people are downvoting the game even if they say themseve that the GAME IS GOOD. A lot of poeple are downvoting the game because of the microtransactions... this is a collectible card game.. I know it's digital, you don't get a physical card when you use real money but still. Unlike the other virtual card game out there, you can actually sell your card and make money out of it. I'm not saying you'll get rich out of this game but this is the exact same thing as playing a physical card game like Magic The Gathering.. They were very clear about that since the very beginning. If this is a problem for you, just don't play the game.. I don't downvote every single game that are not my style. I don't downvote evry single coop game because I dislike coop.. I just don't play them ! Anyway : Solid mechanics, beautiful art, real strategie unlike other rng card games out there.
Dont listen to the trolls, this is a good game.  The cheapest TCG online.  I love MTGA but the investment would be insane compared to this.  Plus playing the free draft is all you really need.
This game is amazing, it's unlike anything I've ever played, despite all the backlash on the monetization side, I think it's still the cheapest TCG on the market, you can get a full collection of all commons for $12.
This is a very good game.

I played in beta for about 30h, got it because of the Steam friends & family pack.
The gameplay is very deep, fun and balanced as far as I can tell,
although I mostly played draft so far. The sound design is as per usual phenomenal,
the graphics are very good for a card game. Everything feels impactful and fun.
The price structure is a big point that many people critize, however I feel like you get a lot of
bang for your buck, since you can play draft for free and get quite a good collection to build a decent deck with the game.
All in all I can heavily recommend buying the game and giving it a shot, it's fun!
First review on Steam!
**FIRST** Regarding the 'cash-grab' - I disagree with this sentiment. If I want to play Yu-Gi-Oh!, Magic, Dragonball-Z, or any other TCG I am going to have to either buy a mediocre starter deck, or buy the cards I want off the market. Also, in these games when I want to play with stakes I go to a cardstore and pay an entrance fee. This game is really no different except that it is virtual. $20 Entrance for starter cards and 10+packs and 10+Event tickets is a very reasonable deal.

Pros:
- You can buy straight from the market. The closest I have seen a computer game come to feeling like a real TCG
- The gameplay loop is actually pretty fun. There is a lot of strategy involved even with simple abilities and games are surprisingly very close. 
- It seems like even with only a standard base set of cards, the meta is still evolving
- Updates have improved leveling, progression, etc.
- Heros, gold/items, minions, and lanes are pretty fun

Cons: 
- How accessible the game is from the start could very well depend on the cards you open in your starter packs. I was lucky enough to get very good packs, so I can play constructed without too much of a worry.
- Games are relatively long. (15-25 minutes)
- If you get a bad opening hand, the game is not fun (this is present in all card games but Hero placement RNG in this game makes this a bit more sour)


I do recomend this game, It's a good game, just not the game for me. 

TL;DR: Good game, pretty good moitization for a card game, not for me due to the match length and lack of progession (No sense of working at something)  

Little about me: I have a couple thousand hours in hearthstone and Dota. I thought this would be the perfect game for me! 
I stopped playing dota because the games took to long and if you lost, it just felt bad. So I switched to HOTS because games were shorter and it was just a personal thing, I still love Dota. 

This game suffers the same issues I personally had with DOTA, games just take to long. For me the sweet spot of a round for any game is 15-20 min, with 30 being a "long game." Here, games take 30-40 minutes on average. I am curious to see if the round time reduces when people become more familiar. 

Either way, it's a solid game as long as you know that you're in a single match for 30-45 minutes every time. 

Suggestions for *fix*: Create a sense of working toward something (i.e. a ladder system) Also, allow some ability for tickets to be earned in game. I suggest a perfect run (5 wins) in casual awards a ticket.
While I don't play any other card games (like Magic or Hearthstone) and so don't have anything to really compare it against, I have been enjoying playing Artifact. It really takes hold of the notion of being a digital-native card game with both hands; I get the distinct feeling that trying to keep track of all the different stats and effects on each card would quickly get very tricky indeed if this were a paper card game.

Certainly it does seem to have a ton of tactical depth; I'm slowly groking what's going on, but I haven't learned nearly enough yet to avoid getting stomped in most of my matches, and I haven't even touched making my own decks yet. Mostly, I've been playing in the "Call to Arms" gauntlet, which supplies both you and your opponent with preconstructed decks with which to play.

This touches on one of the elements of Artifact: you need to own the cards you want to put in your own deck. However, like the aforementioned gauntlet, there are ways to play which don't need you to own any cards at all, or to construct your own decks. If you're unsure about Artifact, you can refund up until you claim your initial starter pack (10 card packs and 5 event tickets), or play more than 2 hours, or own the game longer than two weeks, so you can play the tutorials and the preconstructed gauntlets to get a feel for the game before committing.

Disclosure: I got Artifact free (because Valve gave all their future games for free to Mac-using early adopters of the Steam Controller as an apology for it not working well) and have been playing in the beta.
Awesome mechanics, awesome game by itself, since it was made by Garfield, the creator of MtG, I had high expetactions, but those expectations where nowhere from what I get from this game, the game is more than I could ever imagine on a Dota 2 card game, animations are flawless, gameplays is fluid, interactions, sounds, everything is really good, I can say that the downside would be that you just cant get cards through gameplay, you do have to pay for them, but since it's a TCG I really don't mind that, great game overall 9,5/10
Artifact is probably the best online CCG I've played. Sure, you have to spend some money in order to obtain the most powerful cards, but that's to be expected when it comes to most card games. The gameplay is fantastic and the visuals/audio are phenomenal. I'd recommend this game for anybody looking for a good CCG, so long as they aren't against microtransactions.
People are complaining about the economy in this game but it's way cheaper than other card games, which is what they ought to be comparing it to. The actual gameplay is very fun and engaging.
First of all, let me address the "Pay to win" debate. Not really..

The game has different modes that will suit different players. Phantom draft mode is not pay to win. Each player gets to draft from 5 random packs and play with cards from the deck assembled with these packs. Collector deck is where you use cards in your inventory - and of course, more you pay, better the cards in your inventory, higher chance to win (i.e pay to win)

Also, there are modes, where you can bet on something (using the tickets system in game). If you go on a winning streak, you get back the tickets and win card packs too. If you loose, you loose the ticket. (Tickets cost money). Then there is casual mode, where you don't need to pay anything - no consequence if you win or lose.

Now that this topic is out of the way, let me give my opinion on the rest..

GAMEPLAY: fantastic. Smooth, great details, good pace, nice animations. No complaints.

GRAPHICS and SOUND: the audio and graphics are good. Keeps the game exciting. Not a lot to look at though given the genre.

COMPEXITY: I have never played any other card based game (like heartstone) but I do play DotA. The game was simple after 4-5 bot games. So no issues on that.

PROGRESSION: this is where I feel the game is a let down for me personally. I don't see the point of playing casual where there is no progression. Something like MMR or achievement systems (with rewards for milestones) would have been better. At this point, I have played 20 games and I already got bored

BALANCE: there is lot of parameters left to randomness in game. But since there are many things that are random, overall I feel each player would feel the game went fair. But, with respect to getting the best cards in you draft, I feel that needs luck. Need some balance here.

Overall, it is a card game done right. I got it for free for attending TI8. But if I were to buy it for current price, I am not sure if I would. The game is fun for the first 10 hours. Then it feels empty without any progression system. Waiting to see what kind of systems Valve would add to keep players hooked (Progression, events, lore, etc.)

Note: if you do not mind paying 10$ for 10hours of fun game, do purchase. (ofcourse game is 20$. But you can sell your cards from 10 free packs + possible winnings from the 5 free tickets for almost 10$)
I do not understand why everyone complains. The game is much more interesting than Hearthstone. If you do not have money and you cannot play at the level with other players - this does not mean that the game is bad, it means that you simply do not have cards for a full-fledged game. Buy cards and don't cry. I sat for a week without cards, the store was closed. But when it opened, I immediately bought all the cards. This game is much cheaper than Hearthstone, where you need a lot of money to make 1-2 decks each addon. Here, to make a black or green deck is worth a penny
One of the best card games I have ever played instantly addictive and really gives the feel of playing dota 2 in the form of a card game. For all the people complaining about the pricing model they must have never played a "card" based game before and if they have certainly not at a high level. Almost every card game in existence since the invention of the genre  has had some element of spending money to accumulate cards,. The better players will be able to get better cards without spending AS much money by winning tournaments/ events etc. The phantom drafting feature is my favorite and it allows you to go "infinite" as long as you can keep winning at LEAST 3 games per run and even get additional packs as prizing if you win more than 3 (obviously the people complaining about having to spend money are not very good because you can win cards by winning drafts.) If you want a game with a really low learning curve that completely spoon feeds you everything with no room for improvement then I guess this is not the game for you but if you are looking for a deeply strategic card game experience with a lot of decision making and a classic dota feel then this IS the game for you.
Honestly, briefly putting aside what many say about the monetization scheme, Artifact is amazing. The mechanics are super interesting, and I've seldom felt such intense gameplay in other games. The visuals and animations are really pretty, too.

Personal opinion: As long as Valve keeps phantom / keeper draft modes available (casual and expert, likewise), I see no need to pay money to construct my own deck. I also don't think I need to own any cards to have fun in this game.

Granted, some hardcore players might view constructing their deck as the core of a trading card game, and objectively one does need to spend some amount of money to build a decent deck, so maybe gauge what type of player you are before making a purchase.
[h1] One of the Greatest Card Games of All Time[/h1]

I've played a lot of card games. Magic, Netrunner, Hearthstone, and Eternal. Artifact bests them all, despite how much I love Netrunner. It does several things well that are very hard to do in games:

First, almost every game is very close. Early blowouts seem insurmountable when you first start playing, but you quickly learn that you can and will overcome early losses. Every loss I feels like I was a single play away from winning. Every victory feels like a clever gambit that worked just in time.

Secondly, there is a lot of depth. When I play with my roommate, we debate almost every play since it is difficult to easily develop a heuristic to find the optimal play. Most other games, with the exception of Netrunner, have pretty clear lines of play interspliced with a few interesting decisions. But in Artifact most of your decisions are interesting decisions, even when using the starter decks.

Thirdly, it's usually easy to recognize mistakes in retrospect. Sometimes in complicated games, it's hard to figure out which decisions led to a loss. In Artifact, I can instantly tell which major mistakes I made after I lose. Town-portaling my hero too early, leaving a lane unattended for too long, not protecting a hero I need to cast a spell next round... it's important that the game allows for mistakes to be identified because it allows for players to grow.

In short, Artifact is the best-designed card game I've ever played. If that's all you need to hear, then buy it. It will intellectually challenge you and provide tremendous entertainment.

The remainder of the review is to address the two major concerns I've seen people make, namely the presence of luck elements and the economic model.

[u]Luck Elements[/u]

Some people might see the luck elements such as creep placement and attack arrows and assume that this is a game where outcomes are heavily luck-based or "RNG". The luck elements here though give you plenty of opportunity to react. It's a lot like backgammon, where there is a lot of little luck that evens out over the course of a game, the skill is navigating the good rolls and the bad rolls (if you ever play a highly-skilled backgammon player, they will crush you even if they roll poorly). I haven't had a game yet where I felt that I lost due to insurmountable bad luck.

[u]Economic Model[/u]

The economic model is the most controversial element, as many people are upset with paying money for cards. The trading card game (TCG) model that the game uses is not my favorite model, I prefer Living Card Games (LCG). However I understand why Valve didn't go with an LCG model since the large number of expansions scare potential new players away as a LCG matures.

The best part about the Artifact economic model is that you can just buy the deck you want. Other card games (such as Hearthstone or MtG: Arena) obscure the cost of the decks by having multiple currencies (gold, gems, and dust) that obfuscate the real cost of the cards. Cutting out that crap to just give me a price in dollars (and letting me sell my cards for dollars!) is much more preferable.

This commitment to a market means that there can't be any way to acquire cards without staking money, otherwise the cards would rapidly deflate in value. This means that there is no way to grind for cards like in other digital card games. Many people used to that model are upset, but I view it as a positive. The whole point of games like Hearthstone offering a very slow grind is to make playing the game habitual. When playing becomes habitual, people predisposed towards addictive behaviors start spending lots of money on their addiction, draining their savings and even taking out loans in extreme cases. These 'whales' fund most of the game. This is a well-known result of most implementations of free-to-play and I believe it is unethical to knowingly design such a system. Hearthstone and Arena aren't being generous by providing a way to 'earn' cards for free, they are deliberately cultivating addiction.

Speaking of free, every game mode (including draft) has both a free and paid version. The paid version is one where you put in a stake, usually a ticket, to try and win prizes. Other than that, the modes are functionally identical, although I believe that the prize mode will attract a higher level of competition. Most importantly, the feature I've wanted ever since Magic Online came out is here: unlimited free draft. Fellow draft aficionados know how great this is since every other card game requires either a time or money investment to draft. This is personally worth the price of admission alone (and the price of admission is a little fuzzy for Artifact, since you get $25 worth of booster packs and tickets when you buy the game).

[u]Final Word[/u]

In conclusion if you want to play the best-designed card game ever, play Artifact. If you're trepidatious about spending extra money on cards, just play endless free draft. If you're not afraid to spend $15-$40 extra on the game for constructed, then this is absolutely the game for you. It will richly reward your time, not with bogus in-game currency, but with incredibly engaging and highly tactical gameplay.
Game is amazing. A lot of people complain about the price model (even though the game wasn't even out yet.. and even today it has only been out for a few years and people cry about it..). Just ignore them. The cards are dirt cheap and you can buy the cards you want. For the $20 price tag you can go into phantom draft and as long as you get 3 wins or more, you get your entry fee back and can get packs. This is the sole way to "grind" - not that you even need to, because cards are pennies on the market. Draft is also insanely fun and it's a free mode.
The game freshly came out yet, but let me tell you something it's different from what people believe it is, it's so much harder and you notice it in the tutorial! For me, this game was worth it it's price. Let's see how far it will go! I hope all the Hearthstone players will enjoy it!
The deepest, most technical, and most rewarding card game I've ever played. Unfortunately a lot of people aren't happy with just an amazing game and require some kind of incentive to keep playing. As for me I'm content with outplaying the crap out of people and feeling smug when I do so.
If they put in some more features for player retention it would be a winner.
Just needs something for people to work towards and give them the endorphin boost they've learnt to depend on from other games. I believe valve.
A cardgame that rewards skill over anything else, just amazing. Don't listen to the butthurt negative reviewers, the monetization is actually not bad at all
Great cardgame, I've been playing card games for many years, and this one is really impressing me because of how different it feels than other games I've played, it has a strong magic vibe with some of its own unique twists added into it, its still early in its life, but from what I have played so far it seems like it may very well be my go to digital cardgame, the one downside is that its a pay to play game, but that is also kind of offset by the fact that you can sell cards on the marketplace and purchase cards as well, which I think is kind of a genious way to get cards since you dont have to worry about RNG with pulling cards or having to save up a large amount of a certain resource (I have played hearthstone, Gwent and Shadowverse, and all these games have some form of this), which means you either have to wait a while to get cards you want, or spend money, which in the long run seems to be more than artifact anyways.
all in all, I definately reccomend this game, I will attempt to update my review when new expansions come out as well.
[h1]Monetization:[/h1] I'd rather pay $15 for a competitive deck in Artifact than have to play Hearthstone and pay >$100 to make a competitive. deck. (or grind arena for months on end to make a competitive deck.)

[h1]Gameplay:[/h1] Despite the issue of poorly designed RNG (that will be covered in the next section), the game has an extremely high skill ceiling, and Valve is investing a lot into Artifact's competitive scene. (1mil 1st prize at their Q1 2019 tourney) This makes for one of the best competitive card games ever created, if not THE best. 

[h1]Artstyle:[/h1] The art direction and music is one of the best of any card game ever created. The only CCG that can hold a fight is Gwent.

[h1]Issues:[/h1] There is a lot of poorly designed RNG in this game. Cards like Cheating Death and Bounty Hunter lead to game states where one of the two players is always unhappy due to a coinflip deciding a lead. Also think that the lack of a ranked ladder system really hurts the game.
Amazing gameplay, limited RNG like other games.  You can not multi-task while playing this game or you will lose.  The best player wins +90% of the time.  Needs some polish on in-game tournaments, social aspects, etc. but those will come.  Amazing game overall.
The gameplay itself is very fun and the core mechanics are all solid. However if you do not want to spend money beyond the initial price point you will be stuck playing the expert (paid) draft modes until you can improve your collection to play constructed.  You can play a casual draft mode for free, but you do not get any rewards and there is no visible ranking system. So unless you really really enjoy playing the game, Artifact might not keep your attention for as long as you would hope due to the lack of obvious progression.

Recommended because Valve will likely address these problems in future updates.
The amount of free content is enough to justify the price tag. Every TCG has monetisation and this is only in its infancy. Valve has a track record of reacting to feedback and I am sure will adjust how things are going moving forward.
Absolutely loving it so far.  I'll be throwing a lot more time into it in a couple weeks but have loved every minute of it I've had a chance to play so far.  Not really getting people's hatred for the business model but maybe that's just cause I grew up with FLG M:TG.
I really like the overarching mechanics, depth of strategy, and the potential of the game moving forward. Most of the negative reviews I read are either out of ignorance or just your typical Hearthstone pissant crying for their bottle of whale's milk back. 

So much of the game is already free, and if you're serious about being competitive in the game, it's going to cost you way less than the predatory F2P lootbox culture that's been perpetuated for far too long. I'm thankful Valve took the time to think this through so people not caught up in the dopamine-driven hivemind can enjoy it. I look forward to seeing where this goes.
Incredible depth and fun mechanics that will only get more interesting from here. Graphics, sound and overall presentation are the best of any digital card game.
The game system is great. You will have to send some more money to play construted, though. That doesn't make the game bad, but retrict it for people actually paying more in this format.
What the game really lacks a better progression system. But I am confident valve will implement that soon enough
I like this game a lot.

It's got great potential! It juest needs an extra expansion of cards to be more diverse.

Also, as soon as they implement a ladder system or reward system for continious play, the game will be much more fun to keep on playing!

I highly reccomend the game. As a Hearthstone, MTG , Pokemon TGC and Harry potter TCG enthusiast.
One of the best card games I have ever played. People like to complain about the monetization model but acquiring cards is so much easier and straight forward than in any other popular tcg. You have to pay money to get cards, that is normal. At this point you can draft for free as much as you want which is already at least a twenty dollar value in my opinion. People like to quote the fact that a complete set is expensive, but you do not require a complete set to play, it isn't required or necessary. It is a good game.
Good card game. I love the mechanisms, the graphics and the universe. The only problem is, to get cards it is necessary to pay with real money which not everybody can afford.  In the last patch they added levels were they offer rewards as a tickets and packs in some levels, being a good change. I think in the future they will smooth the action of getting new cards.
First time I've been logging into an online card game just to enjoy myself rather than to just do daily quests for rewards.

Great game, deck building is fun, gameplay itself is deep. Excited for future set releases.
This game is not as much fun as dota because you cannot grief teammates, learn spanish and try hard in low priority. Plus it's not a free game. Definitely not recommended.
An excellent digital card game that dare I say is better than hearthstone in visuals and animations. A game I find quite enjoyable and the prices  so far of cards are mostly fair. I strongly recommend this game to anybody who isn't enslaved to grinding
Great game. If you like card games you will love this, very complicated but fun.
Not as expensive as everyone says, especially now with a new patch they fixed a lot of thing.
A lot of negativity around the web, but I think that you need to give this game a chance. I got addicted very fast.
For me the best game on steam, cant wait for a new edition and more cards.
Great game, not really dependant on your wallet, especially with Call to Arms event, which i really enjoy. It gives a fair gameplay without me worrying that i don't have a good card set. Haven't really tried the other modes though.

Even if you don't have particular cards, buying them straightaway helps a lot, so you don't just have to endlessly open a pack to get the card you need. Most of them are quite cheap. But so far, I don't feel pressured by the absence of the full set, I think people are over-exaggerating this issue.
After the patch on 21 December, Valve has literally fixed all the problems the community had with the game, Artifact is the best card game available now on the market, they have add progression, changed their philosophy to include frequent card changes and have free packs and tickets as rewards now. It's great! If you previously overlooked this title, I strongly suggest that you try it again.
The game is the most original card game I have played yet.

I tried Gwent, Eternal, Elder Scrolls: Legends, Shadowverse, Magic the gathering: Arena, Hearthstoner and at least 10+ other cards games online and none come close to the originality this game has to it. 

This feels like a board game mixed with a card game, very fun, very polished, deep strategy, its great.

People complaining about the money part, this is a TCG, all of the other games I mentioned and that people are comparing this to online, those are CCG. Whats the difference? THIS GAME every card has real money value, you can sell them on steam for money to buy games, trade them for games or items to your friends or other cards, none of those other games allow this.

"OMG I DON'T HAVE MONEY!!!!" --- Then learn how to use steam better. You can get cards off any game you play on steam pretty much, sell the cards form those games, use that to buy cards in Artifact. Youe CSGO skins? Your TF2 items? Your DOTA 2 items? Your Case keys? Sell those or trade those for Artifact CARDS!!! There are 100 other things you can do that involve the built in steam trade system, market and so on to get "free money" here on steam. Why don't people use their heads more instead of being sheep and saying every game on steam is bad nowadays because its too costly or because it has 1 bug?

This game will surely add more and more ways to win stuff, earn stuff, just how othert Valve games have added awesome things over time. 

I am enjoying the game and the mini-game of trading on steam to get money to ghet more cards.. no extra money spent so far other than the $20 to get the game and I have acquired a bunch of cards already.

You get 10 packs to start out included with game purchas,e you may get a $20 card or $5 ones and you can sell those to get more packs or cards you need.
I love this game so far. A lot of people are complaining about how you have to buy packs, but they give you a ton of content to play with. I much prefer the way they have gone about it vs other games like hearthstone.
Everyone is saying this game is pay to win. 
I disagree, you can play the core game with all the features for free. 
Draft (Hearthstone Arena) for free without ingame grind currency. 
Constructed, (Build a deck and play with it) free with friends and randoms. 

There are currently 3 Ways to get cards and this is true, Buy packs 1,75€ for a pack with one RARE card.
Playing EXPERT! games, where you need to enter with a ticket, one ticket ~1€
Keeperdraft, also a expert mode, where you provide 5 card packs and open them and you keep the cards.
And buying cards of the market witch is super nice, you sell like 5 Dota immortals and you got a pretty good deck. 
Also you can recycle cards for ticket (20 cards for 1 Ticket) Buy some cheap cards of the market and you are good to go for the next expert play. 

To the people who say Pay to Win, every card game got this. But you got here some Modes (Call to ARMS!) with preconstructed decks, you can play vs friends (if you got some ;) with their decks or just with deck without rares and so on. 
You can play DRAFT! where you literally need no money to be as good as the others because they got the same chance of getting cards. 

This game is so much fun, and even if you dont spend money on it you can always have a quick nice game in draft or with rotated game modes and preconstructed decks.
have u played magic the gathering offline guys? there is no free cards if u want to play u play not whine about it bc it doesnt give u free shit.

the 20$ u pay is worth 10 packs and 5 even tix

if u convert that into money value its more or less 25$ usd.

u cant expect to get the full worth of 20$ when opening packs bc.... wtf if u get 20$ worth in cards what difference would it make if the other players also get the same card value its all about luck :*

ps: i opened a pack with 2 axe heroes hehe
Amazing game, very complex but very interesting if you like it that way. The monetization scheme is the best I've encountered for card games so far, no idea why a lot of people are on edge about this.
Great graphics, amazing aesthetics and phenomonal polishing. It's really a shame the player numbers dwindled so quickly. I am hoping Valve is able to fix this and that the game will live on for a long time.
Yea a whole collection costs like a few hundred bucks, so what, if you ever played MTG you would know how high priced those little pieces of paper are. Its not like any deck you'll want to play will be very expensive anyways, hardly over the initial 20$ and worth it to me, its Dota in a card game and very fun, I'm sure the animations and effects will improve also and aren't so bad already.
The game is fun no doubt.
When u loose ...
it hurts ... 
when u win ...
Its like u just convinced the parents that is was ur sister that took dad's cookies ;]
The only problem (and this sounds consistant),
you cant do nething in this game without money
THEY NEED TO PUT IN SOMETHING WERE U CAN WIN PACKS WITHOUT SPOENDING MONEY!!!
There is literally NO WAY to do this, and it destroys the game
It's Magic arena with 3 games at once.. It doesn't have the complexity of Magic: the Gathering, but  it wasn't meant to have. Plus it has something MTGA never will, free phantom draft option!
I exclusively play draft, and it is an enormous amount of fun. Game has many strategic and tactical decision points and requires you to adjust plans on the fly. Production is top notch--cards feel great to play.
[h1]Peasants Need Not Apply[/h1]

If you're the sort of depressing dork that is willing to spend eight hours of their day, doing the same exact thing over and over again all so you can earn one to two dollars worth of content, this game isn't going to be for you. In Artifact, there is no scheme to put you to work earning less than a dollar an hour as a "warm-body" to help inflate the game's player count. You're not going to find a massive wall of grind between you and the good stuff. Artifact does not weigh you down with mind-numbing busywork, the trade off, however, is that the game costs money to play.

Card games cost money to play, there, I said it. The reason games like HS don't cost money to play is because they are not WORTH paying to play. God help you if you buy booster packs in HS, that is a level of sad beyond my understanding. Games like MTG [u]are[/u] worth playing, and people pay to play them. So the real question regarding Artifact isn't: "Is it free to play? If not its bad." The real question is: "Is Artifact WORTH paying to play?"

Yeah, its pretty great.

There's a ton of depth in Artifact, every game feels fresh, even mirror matches. Every loss has a misplay behind it, and you'll recognize it if you're paying attention, nothing feels random or out of your control. There are almost zero restrictions in deckbuilding besides a minimum card count, you can combine the colors however you'd like, use whichever heroes you like, stock your shop as you please. 

Also, if you are one of the few people that loved L5R, this game does a lot of similar things (this is my favorite part). Having a "presence" in every battlefield is important, as you play most of your spells and abilities through the heroes in the active lane. Theres also a "you go, I go" pattern to playing cards that keeps decision making tense, and you have to decide which cards you drop right away, and which you can risk not being able to play. On top of that, you have to keep initiative in mind, as if you're the last player to not play a card or activate something in a lane, you act second in the next lane, which can have major consequences.

Fun and interesting interactions are basically constant in this game, if you are all about card games I highly recommend it.
Early review but I like the game a lot so far. Has a great strategic feeling to it, almost as deep as Magic but not quite. I don't really care about buying cards but if you're against that nothing will change your mind, but overall a good game so far. And being a Dota fan, it just has that Dota feel to it. From the responses to the music and all the sound effects, but now you don't have to deal with your teammates!
This is a good game because I instantly made 5 dollars + the purchase price from literally opening my packs and selling back an Axe on the Steam Market. Thanks GabeN.
literally the cheapest TCG out there with high quality game play but every scrub is mad because it's not a free2grind model. lf you check the math made by various people on reddit it's clear that from a competitive stand point this game is super affordable. prices are low as fuck. but as long it's not compeltely free scrubs from hearthstone and other baby card games are going to bitch that they can't grind for what is essentially 3 times less than the minimum wage. ROFL
REWORK THE CANCER NAMED: CHEATING DEATH . Other than that, the game is insanely good and complex.
Also satisfying AF watching HS retards crying for the perfect price model of the game.
The game is awesome to play and has a very high production value.

All the people giving negative reviews about the price are just angry. They are like my wife. 

When I go out with my wife she always expects certain things to happen. I don't know maybe go to her favourite restaurant or watch a certain movie. But in reality we just decide spontaneously what we do and probably end up eating a sandwich and just have a drink in a bar before realizing we are way too tired for anything and go home. Point is she expects certain things in her head beforehand and then gets really angry if they do not become reality.

Same happened here. People expected to be able to get cards by playing. They bought the game and now they are angry. But they should really be angry about themselves. They did not get enough information about the game before buying.

Valve made the decision that you can only buy cards, not earn them. 

Taking this example to an extreme: You should not buy Call of Duty in expectation of a Rollercoaster Tycoon because of your lack of information and then brag about that all you do is shooting people.

The angry people should also read the articles on PCGAMER.COM. They clearly write why in the end Artifact is quite the "cheap" collectible card game compared to the other kings like Magic and Hearthstone. 

https://www.pcgamer.com/card-game-players-and-pc-gamers-may-never-agree-on-artifacts-pricing/

Quote: 
"The very first constructed tournament [...] and the first groups have been played. In Group A, Strifecro took the win with a Blue/Green combo deck that costs $64, and Lifecoach came in second with a Red/Green ramp deck that costs $81. In Group B, Xixo won with a Red/Black Oath deck that costs $40, while StanCifka took the second place with his version of Red/Black that costs $53.

If you compare these deck prices to competitive Magic decks, you can see where the card game players are coming from. At Grand Prix Milwaukee, the cheapest deck in the top 10 was Jacob Tilk’s Mono-White Aggro, which costs $70 in Magic Online and $251 in physical form. The winner, Adrian Sullivan, played a Jeskai Control deck that costs $170 in Magic Online and $534 in paper. From this perspective, Artifact does not look expensive at all."

Here an interesting youtube video that sums it up:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huUfHN0qiak&ab_channel=Kothorix
Beautifully complex and compelling card game, it has a learning curve but the depth is what makes it so good. Don't worry about the mixed reviews, it's just half life 3 assholes and hearthstone children rolling their forehead on a keyboard. Would recommend if you want to learn a good and satisfying game that can be played seriously or casually.
This is fantastic card game. One of the best I have ever played. Do not let the other negative reviews discourage you from picking up this game. It is incredibly fun and polished and worth every cent. Do yourselves a favor and get this game. Sure the monetization can be off putting but honestly it is still cheaper than most of the other popular f2p card games. Especially if you take into account the cost to complete the set. I believe aritfact cost around $200-$300 for a full set if you go and buy everything without trying win packs and opening the 10 it gives you with the game. Thats the average cost to complete a top tier deck for most other games. So keeping that in mind, Artifact is WAY cheaper. You do not have to put in more money to get more packs. It is possible to continue to play free if you're a decent player and recycle extra cards from packs you win to get more tickets. Bottom line is...get the game it is very very good.
There is a difference between pay 10 dollars to win... and pay 10 cents to win. If you can afford $20 to buy this game and not 10 cents per card for a deck... then what are you doing with your life lol.
Game is extremely fun and complicated. In comparison with other Card Games is not really that costly.

Plus if you only want to play Draft there is a free draft mode that you only need buy the game to play.
I have played every online card game available, whether it be Hearthstone, Magic, Eternal, and Elder Scrolls. I find this to be the most entertaining and most fair when it comes to cards. I have spent hundreds on Hearthstone and I never feel good about it. I was able to create many viable decks for a mere fraction of that, 20 dollars. I know some people think with the asking price of 20$ there should be way to earn cards for free, I disagree.

The game is extremely well thought out and, for the most part, balanced.  You can win consistently with the deck that you build with your starter cards, and *most* cards on the marketplace are relatively well priced.  The mechanics are very simple to pick up, but strategy runs deep, with many cards that can change the tide of the game in just one turn.  $1.99 for a pack of  cards is a reasonable number to pay, and more often than not, you can sell the cards in the pack for $1 or more.  This is a great alternative to other games in the genre.
Game is a BLAST with friends, and the monetization is not a problem at all, you can play draft FOR FREE FOR EVER and thats the main gamemode. Dont let people tell you otherwhise
The nagative reviews are made up of the usual "everything should be free" and "I want it for free" complaints for people who think that the developers, artists and any number of other employees who made it possible should not be reimbursed for thier work. Pfft. It's a CCG game, folks. Except it's digital. It's no different than MTG or any other CCG game. You can buy and sell cards or just trade. That's how it works. It's actually a really good CCG to boot. But you may need to spend a little money to build a competive deck unless you get really lucky with the included boster packs. But still, it costs far less money than in most CCGs, actually. The interface to buy and sell your cards is bult right into the game as well which is really cool. Great game.
Spend your money... This game should not be Free-To-Play. MTG Arena has the color blue and red, which is illegal.  Get good at drafting. Its about two 5/10s which is basically 10/10 on the fun scale and there is no better ways to spend your time. Fall for those hyping this...look at the Twitch views to see that this is never a dead game.
The game is fun. And it has the greatest presentation of any card game. People upset about prices should never look into actual TCG, which is what this is.
A great game. Great rendition of the Dota game. 
It takes a few hours to really understand the majority of the subtleties. I still don't undertand why sometimes your unut attack the tower while other times it attacks a defender.
I don't really understand the critics concerning the economy. For about 2€ I bought plenty of nice cheap but interesting cards. And I indulge and spent about 5€ in 2 cards (a 4€ hero, and a 1€ spell). I think it's much cheaper to buy the cards you like rather then buying packs. The cards are so cheap, most costs a few cents.
Anyway, I'm trying to build a nice black deck. Plenty of strategies and I still have other colors to tinker with. 
Great great game.
Personally, I enjoy the hell out of Artifact. That is not to excuse some of the missteps it makes, but it is a solid enough game to provide a good amount of entertainment. The visuals are far and away best in class, and it has a spectacular system of general mechanics. I would highly recommend this game, even if you do not approve of the pricing models. It is such an enjoyable game that it is just a joy to play casual, non-prize games (which cost nothing and still provide rewards as you level up).
I will and I am recommending this game honestly even after I've read revs like "p2w" "pay pay" "credit card best card".
Well not gonna argue, this game is pretty much about making money but the trading system [I mean the market place] plus the fact that 1 pack of 12 cards costs 1.75E, I mean It's pretty affordable for those [like me] who don't want to spend a lot of money in games. Once a month I think all of us can manage to buy at least 2-3 packs [like 5.20E, dunno exactly] so you won't get bored to see the same cards over and over again. 

If you don't want to pay, just, dunno play with a deck made by yourself, with default decks vs random people or vs friends or vs bots

Dunno just enjoy the game, I kinda like it tho I didn't want to buy it at all

EDIT #1: Someone said in this review section something like - you can get your money back or at least half money back by selling the rare cards and you can try to make a deck with ceap cards [0.03-0.20E] with nice and great combos
This game simulates kinda the real life card gaming when you had to buy packs from store for like 1E and make your pack stronger and trade with friends [2 cards for a better or 2 for 2]
Not for Casuals Players that want to play competitive. If u really want to play comp(constructed tho theres other free comp game modes) u probably (unless u really good) got to pay more money stop crying. Tho u wont have disadvantages if u a base game only player will in the cta, the casual, the papuer and the draft mode. The Game has fun gameplay and insane depth (id say  more than standard and even modern mtg) altough as of rn theres too much rng in my opinion tho im sure thats gonna get changed soon cuz big boi backlash. The Meta atm is spicing up the first two weeks u saw kind of the same decks all the time but rn u cann really see that the metagame is getting way more diverse. I do think that this game is going to have a great e sport scene and a great future - eventho not for casuals.
People who are complaing about the pay2win system of artifact are....special! Ok maybe there is no easy life for who want to be free user and just pay the game,but people are even complaing because is not free to play! They are complaing about the whole system and maybe they spend 300++++ pounds/euro/dollar/whatever on game like Hearthsone, Magic,yugioh,duel master, EVERY FUC*ING SINGLE GAME CARDs. And they did it only beacuse these games are FREE TO PLAY! LOL! YES FREE TO PLAY AND FREE TO FALL BEHIND if you dont use microtrasaction. Here you buy cards,not fuckign skin (And we all know you spend more than 300 in game like lol and fortnite.) At very least here you choose what card you want to buy. EVERY SINGLE FUCKIGN CARD GAME IS MEANT TO BE PAY TO FU***ING WIN! Just like real life. There are card for 500 pounds in real life. But a videogame? NO!!! Unacceptable! WE WANT THE GAME FREE TO PLAY AND WE WANT CARDS FOR FREE! BUUUUUUU! -_-  But hey...Valve realsed a card game instead of half life 3,portal 3 or tf3 so let's just bombing it with negative rewiew and complaing about a market system that is way better than "Let's shop 300 pound per expansion and let's see if we can get one lagendary at least!1!!!1!" *cough* Sh*tsto*e *Cough*



In the end, the game is jsut a mix of Heartstone and Magic but inDotA universe. Maybe harder the other card game but nonthless less fun. Don't be afraid and give it a try. Just 15 pounds. If u don't like it its not like u have lost a lot. Ah no.. YOU ARE FREE USER ahaahaha! xD Seriuos tho. don't be infulenced by me aor others.
Best game from Valve and ever! Absolutely worth it's price and has no cons.
Why?
Let's go:
1. Deep strategical mechanics and potential. 
2. You don't need top spec computer and accessories to play it.
3. Stay relaxed and don't click the shit out of your devices playing moba's, shooters or battle royales.
4. No need to donate like everybody whines about, if you learn consistently by playing with bots, events or casual phantom drafts.
5. Boosts your thinking and analytical skills.
Great game, great complexity. You can actually go infinite for free and dont have to pay a dime after you buy the game if your IQ is higher than your age.
This game is absolutely amazing! Sometimes it can be pay 2 win, but just playing with bots can be just as fun as playing with a human, and they have the cards that you choose for them. Graphics 10/10. Gameplay 9/10. Content 9/10. Fairness 6/10. Controls 10/10
Free draft mode, interesting gameplay, and if you're good enough, you can earn packs forever for free with the starter pack. Everyone complaining about pay to win is just sad that the game doesnt reward losers.

I don't really play constructed so I played 2 games of keepers draft with my starter pack, then sold my cards to buy tickets for the expert draft modes. 

TL;DR - git gud
People whinging on about the microtransactions obviously don't know what "trading card game" means or entails, so we'll put that aside for now. Artifact is an incredibly solid card game that looks, plays and sounds very good. The major issues right now are the lack of multiplayer features, but these are all things that can and more than likely will be added. The omission of these features for the time being does not detract from how good the game is in it's current state in my opinion, great work Valve.
This game is good but it lacks pirates.  Also it doesn't have any water quality textures.

This game is much better

The game is wonderful, the music, the gameplay is fluid. For people who don't want to spend money, there are casual games and call to arms events, you can even play draft mode for free. If you want to play more on competitive level, you have to spend some money. The game in my opinion is great, due to it being a true TCG where you can trade cards with other players and I am sure the game will just get better with time.
it's ok

(I'll edit this to be longer sometime when I've played it more, I just want to nudge a positive review out there cuz I'm pretty sure this game doesn't deserve its current 58% steam rating.)

edit, followup: OK, now it's 53%.

Anyway: Artifact is a fun card game. Lots of people are mad about the pricing structure. That's sort of understandable, for people who specifically want to play Constructed at the highest level. That'll cost you some money. Like... $40, if you want an absolute Meta Deck. But there are some much cheaper decks that are still competitive.

But I've played barely any constructed (note my hours), since Free Phantom Draft is completely free, and fun in a Roguelike reacting-to-randomness kind of way.

It's not a game I recommend taking competitively (but I wouldn't like playing any kind of card game "competitively"), but it's a distinct and fun game nonetheless.

The form of the "fun" is the constant, intense thought required, to factor in all the variables of the situations and make your best guess of a decent play. There's so much thinking possible that it's potentially a pretty stressful game. It's a lot more stressful if you get mad about losing to RNG, but if you treat it like a fun board game (as in, a randomness-heavy game that you play for the fun of the ever-changing puzzle, rather than for deterministic competition), then it will turn out to be a fun board game.

If you want to play Constructed, I recommend playing with friends (so you're not forced into meta decks), and playing Pauper/Peasant (commons or commons+uncommons only, since it's much cheaper without Rares).
The true spiritual successor to MTG, while being cheaper than any other card game out there.

The most expensive card(Axe) at the time of this post is less than 16 euros.

Can't recommend it enough for thoe that came from MTG.
As a long time card game player and an even longer Dota player coming from the days of the OG Dota, Artifact is not just a gimmick. Its made by Richard Garfield, the guy who created MTG! Need I say more? The depth is nicely maintained by the game to keep the veterans enetertained but not overly compicating it for the newer players of the genre. You have to play it to understand, because sometimes when you watch it you don't understand what the hell is going on! It might be a little costly but, the CASUAL modes are all FREE so you can practice with BOTs or real people, participate in community driven tourneys and learn! I have all the card required for constructed and it took me $300 to get the complete set. But, I was lucky too, many people have spent more than that and still dont have all the cards.I was prepared for the game to spend money and you don't need to if you don't want to, you can enjoy all the gamemodes and tournaments! 

If you are a card game or even a Dota fan, please try the game! The have done a great job with music and lore and also the art of the game is just stunning even though the card art of GWENT feels a little better  :P. I have to give props to VALVE for not just making a gimmicky card game to just make money out of. They hired the correct people for the job and they listened to the community and made it so that people who don't want to spend money can still enjoy the game fully. I am confident that we are going to see even more positive changes coming in the future. I am going to recommend Artifact to anyone who want to play a new polished game with amazing gameplay and social features. Doesn't matter if you have played card games in the past, even if this your first card game, go for it.

9/10 would like to see a little more stuff added like a MMR system, Stats page and other basic stuff.
TLDR; The gameplay is great, jobless fools who've never played TCG's are review bombing because the pricing format is the exact same as any other TCG.

I'll start with the obvious. Yes, you have to pay money to get cards in your collection even after you buy the game (which functions as access to the game as well as a starter pack) and a lot of people are upset with that fact. Every other genuine TCG requires you to purchase cards, and this is a TCG through and through. If you want to enjoy the draft mode, however, there is a free option where you can enjoy the game with all of the cards. 

If you want to do constructed you will have to buy cards/open packs to play, but honestly the pricing isn't that ridiculous in the grand scheme of things. A few of the best cards cost around $10-15, but that's literally two cards at the time of writing this review. The rest are usually $5 and under, and building a competitive deck shouldn't cost more than $30 dollars. In comparison to other games in this genre, that's very reasonably priced. Broke idiots are mad about this and negative reviewing bombing the game because of it. 

Pricing controversy aside, the gameplay is amazing. There is a lot of information to process in this game, but it's relatively easy to pick up. Managing three boards at once is easier than it seems on paper, and once you get into a rhythm with the game it becomes super engaging. Strategically placing your cards in certain positions and certain lanes is crucial to doing well, which is a welcome break from simply hoping you draw your combo/game winning cards. There are many more reliable elements than some card games, which allows strategy to take center stage. I'm still learning the game so I'm sure my thoughts on the gameplay will change, but as of now it's a breath of fresh air in the card game genre.
Everyone's crying because you don't have ranked or any shit mmr-leaderboard.

BECAUSE THE GAME WANT US TO HAVE FUN. TO TRY DIFFERENT STRATEGIE AND LAUGH WITH OUR FRIENDS.

But I guess those nerds under me don't have any.

Epic game so, worth to buy but you'll have to pay a few more bucks to get some cards if you're unlucky (well 0.03€ per cards, it's not horrible you know)
Don't pay attention to review bomb kids, they have no idea what is TCG and they cry that game has "bad monetization scheme". They came from mobile F2P grind games and think Artifact has a "monetisation scheme". It's not a MONETIZATION, it's a card market, it's about cards that obtain value and sweet feeling of opening packs. Like they really expected cards to be free. What's the point then?

The gameplay itself is appealing and fun. At first glance it looks like it has simple mechanics, but the more you play in your first hours - the more you realise how much potential the game has. I've already had an epic 30 min match where it was not certain who's gonna win until the very end. I like this aspect of the game the most, the battle can become really dramatic.

Game has nice game modes - casual free drafts and matchmaking as well as competetive payed drafts with rewards. At the beginning you get 2 starter decks and 10 packs. You can build a cheap deck in ~10$, a 2-3 tier deck in 40-90$ and you can obtain all set for ~300$. It's not actually that much compared to how much you have do donate into HS or MTG Arena to be competetive. Market part of Artifact is greatly organized right ingame.

Also currently there is an intro event when you can play 5 free constructed decks to learn set mechanics.

Overall Artifact won't be a super popular game. Kids these days won't like that game isn't a grinding HS-like casual thing, it's not very interesting to watch it on stream, etc. Artifact will gain niche audience and will live a long TCG life.

Artifact is complex, which is neither good nor bad. Going in blind, you will lose until you learn (in game or out) the strategy.

The game doesn't give you much for detailed information, but is pretty clear once you've past the tutorial.

The monetization is, in theory better than Hearthstone (as you can buy what you want rather than throwing money at packs). As well you aren't 'forced' to play, you don't play for dailies, you play for fun and if you take the game seriously, pay to play Competitive and try to win prizes.

As far as first impressions, the game is 'good', and we'll see with newer sets where things will head. Artifact is the game for "I can't afford to throw money at a game, but I don't want to grind"
This game is not as bad as the reviews, read this first.

For people that want a good decent and unique card game this is the one. It is really fun, it have good mechanics. It really feels like dota 2 in a card game. People seems like to exaggerate pay 2 win in this game too much, because i really think that the price is reasonable (come on guys there is story game that finished only 3 hours of gameplay that cost $20 and the card deck for the game is only $2 which actually DON'T have crazy rate drop [ i got axe that cost $10 with one of these ] so if you lucky you can gain profit if you want to sell it ). And the benefit that you can actually sell your card [ steam market function ] is actually good for players that want to change different styles of deck time to time (even there is taxes). My advice is if you want to get into this game you should make some research first and buy the cards you want so that you don't have to spend a lot of money. For me i spend like $5 more to complete my deck as they give you free 5 / 10  card deck at first i don't remember. ( i recommend to buy the card in the market if it below $1 it will help you much) The quality of the art and how smooth this game is really worth $20 so i recommend this game.

P.S. : if you recycle a card you actually can get a ticket for the event so it's kinda nice, and if you win 3 game and lose 1 you get your ticket back. So git gud before going competitive
[b] For all the people writing all these nice negative comments about the business model/financing [/b]

Constructed in artifact is not the only way to play the game! A great example was the first tournament hosted where they chose to use Draft as the mode of choice (in my opinion it is a very good competitive mode).
In general you don't actually need to open packs at all to have a nice experience in the game. The draft mode (casual or expert) is very fun and the expert version only costs 1 ticket which is 0.9 € or just buy 20 random cards (20*0.4 = 0.8 €). 

What do you start with: 
10 packs with each 12 cards and including atleast 1 uncommon. If you are lucky (like I was) you get one of the top priced cards like drow ranger and simply sell them. In total I managed to get 19 € (~24 draft runs) so I actually gained steam currency. If you are one of the very unlucky people you might end up with all your cards being at the lowest price (0.04 €) which you could simply convert into draft tickets (120 cards -> 6 tickets). 

In summary even the most unlucky person will start with 11 tickets. How long you managed to keep playing the expert mode until you managed to not reach 3 wins (11*) times is up to your own skill (the draft system is imo not as luck based as the HS arena). Additionally every run with more than 3 wins is very likely going to give you another ticket on top!

[i] *this number depends on your initial pack openings (luck) and your skill (more than 3 wins) [/i]

Furthermore you can play all the modes which do not require tickets or your own cards as the above mentioned casual version of phantom draft or the event mode call to arms preconstructed. The only downside of not having cards (other than not being able to play constructed duhh) is that there is currently no option to challenge friends with the draft mode (currently you have to host a tournament with at least 4 people). Therefore playing 1v1 with a friend might get boring after some time as you can only play the 2 starter decks or the one of the 6 event decks. 

I realize that there are people who are diehard fans of constructed and for these people this game might get expensive depending on your personal skill and the ability to grind with phantom draft or not. The amount of money you will need to follow the meta is hard to determine as this highly depends on the dynamics of the market place, your skill and the time you can invest. Additionally for future players this business model will be fairer than the one used in HS considering because it is very likely that older cards are going to be less expensive. Also new players will have the opportunity to buy the cards they want.

Overall I'd recommend people with low budget to simply stick to the draft modes, play tournaments with friends and avoid going for constructed.
Reallly well designed game with the usual amazing level of polish you can expect from Valve. Valve have also showed they are fearless when it comes to improving it.

If your looking for a great game thats a little more mentallying taxing than Hearthstone with a more mature aesthetic than this is the game for you!
i really like this game. its like a turn based card version of a moba. i find it very fun challanging and thrilling....all these people who are complaining about it being heavily unbalanced....i mean.....yeah its been out for not even a month so far.....have you personally played any other game in the world in this day and age? there unbalanced at release. unbalanced buggy glitchy and in certain cases...*beth* extremely shitty....yeah...my green and blue deck got its ass handed to it by a full red deck...without even trying..and thats fine it will likely get fixed later....and those people bitching about pay to ploay? or pay to win? a community market were you get a tone of shit...so...like mmo's....like...shit..if i dont list games the list would be smaller that didnt have some sort of money system. i spent 5 bucks and got my perfect green and blue deck. wow. thats like..bank breaking. most people have that much in there steam wallet. your critically shitting on a brand new game for shit that is common with every game..... good job...do i recomend this game? if you like card games....turn based games..and moba's...yeah...i love it..i enjoy it...i can see the issues...but those will likely be fixed...you just have to give it time...
Server's unstable right now (reminds me of the early Dota 2 days), rather than that it's a solid card game with a deeper learning curve and improve mechanics than the other TCG available right now.
spent like $20 for the game, sold all what i got for ~$25, got 1 month of dota plus (im paying it) thats another ~$5. nice game, thanks.
serious mode on: free arena - thanks volvo. paid arena for smarties also
I've only played a few games, so I will need to revise this review once I have sunken more time into it. Visually beautiful, the music is cinematic, there is a lot of lore built into this game.

The games are a little long for my attention span, but so engaging. Looking forward to spending more free time with Artifact.
Played magic for years, this game is amazing.

People QQing about monetization are dishonest (haven't tried it) or haven't thought about it for two seconds. You can draft for free if you don't want to spend money, and It's not even a full priced game. 

BUT I haven't even had to do free drafts because it's so easy to win tickets back from the Expert. I have put no extra money into this game and I still have enough to do a paid draft 4 more times, and have won packs.

This entire system of monetization and tournament play so far beyond better than Hearthstone or Magic, that I will probably never play either of them again.
Alrighty. I'm going to start of and say that this review will be biased in a sense. I'm a pretty big Dota fan. So therefor this is the best card game out there. But then again this is really the only one I've play so don't get offended just yet. If your're a Dota fan and intrested in the setting and lore. Then this is an excellent experiance and builds upon the lore massively. And the world is very well expressed through the gorgeous sound tracks, graphics and affects.

Now when it comes to the actual game I believe that this is legit a pretty well designed game (Mostly). It's fun, tense, addictive and competitive. It certainly has its RNG and I do think that aspect can be tonned down a bit, just a few cards here and there tweaked a little bit but it doesn't completely ruin a game. Well it certainly can, but I haven't seen a situation where its game over from Round 1 which i found quite prevelent in Yu-Gi-Oh! But thats only from a limited experiance. 

The AI is quite decent (Unlike Dota) and does provide an adequate experiance for training, experimenting and for entertainment. 

Now to something that is very controversial that many people have seen and well, are only slightly justified in saying. The progression. The only way to obtain cards are to: Trade, Buy, win 3 competitive games without lossing 2 in a run and by winning a Keeper Draft match. And people are rightly annoyed about this. However... this may be one of or at least one of the few card games where you don't actually need any cards to play. And this is ignoring the starting decks mind you. You only need to own cards to create a deck which is used in standard matchmaking and or Constructed game modes. You can play the draft modes and create a deck from a random pool which you you can use in that particular gauntlet. Or you can play in the pre-made event decks where you verse others who've selected to play in that same mode with the pool of pre-made decks at your disposal. 

Now you do have to own tickets to play competitivly. This is a bit of a bummer because if you have some bad runs or run out of tickets you either have to recycle 20 cards for a ticket or spend $5 for a bundle of 5. But in most competitive matches you play, you'll likely win at least 3 out of 5 games and get back your ticket, but getting to that point is never guaranteed, especially given RNG.

Not competitive? Or you just need a few specific cards for a deck? Then a very large majority of cards can be cheaply obtained for a few cents each, or you can just buy a pack. But I'd recommend you practise at the game and get good enough to play competitive games. And as I said earlier, you don't need to own cards. However there are a few cards that are hugely expensive such as Axe and Drow. They shouldn't be remaining at that price for long.

Ehhh, on a side note the tutorial could have explained more of the games features and better, but there are plently of Youtube guides and videos explaining what it doesn't.

In all Artifact is a pretty solid game, once you get past the mind set that you don't need to own cards unless you want to play specific modes. In the end though that is basically a paywall of sorts and therefor kinda deserves its current "Mixed" reviews.
The complexitiy of the game itself is very good and the monetization model isn't the best if you're a fan of draft but if you really like constructed you're in for a good time. People don't seem to grasp that this is a lot cheaper than other TCG/CCG games out there overall. You can't draft for 6$ or have a fully competitive deck for less than 50-100$ in MtG (for example).
hey, dogs and kids hating on this game, doing stupid math, trying to prove everyone something
if u dont like this game GET THE HELL OUT OF IT, sell your cards, delete it, never come back, dont talk about it and go play some skillstone. 

Maybe the game succeed maybe not, but fact is it is The best card game ever.
Amazing game that taught me how stupid people really are! Showed me how desperate people are to diffuse thier own misery by spreading it to as many other people as they can through   baseless and factless trolling!

10/10!!!
The price model is just like any other real card game i dont see the big deal. Very good game if you have the time and money to invest just like a real card game.
YOU HAVE TO BE DELUSIONAL TO THINK A CARD GAME IS A ONE PURCHASE BUY. Y I K E S. IMAGINE. oof 
The same people saying this is has bad monetization are the same retards who pre-purchase each hearthstone expansion. 

With tickets you can endless play draft which is what I love, just be good and you can always keep playing. After winning a few, get lucky, sell some cards, recycle some cards; Get more cards, get more tickets. 
If you want to play constructed in competitive then the real money spending will come into effect but I feel like you can do just fine, as long as you're not pinned against some drow buyer.  

Anyways, fun game, lot of friends have it and we're having a blast with the tournament system and setting up custom rules.
It is a really good game. I don't mind the price, there can be a lot of fun with the initial packs. You don't really need to pay for additional packs to enjoy the game unless you really want to. Also you can sell cards and buy new ones from what I see ( haven't tried yet ).
And don't listen to all the complains from the internet that this is Pay2Win, other games that I will not name here are in fact pay2win even if they are free at the start. Read some professional sites reviews first.
You will always have kids complaining about everything nowadays on the internet, just because they think they deserve everything, and this is misleading a lot of people.
A still want a new Half Life or Portal game, but this is a very good comeback for Valve. If you read this comment, welcome back, hope you will bring more good games in the future.
Nowadays, gamers have been fed with too much 'free' titles. Many players think that all games should be free and a good game should be able to let them earn stuff such as 'daily bonus' 'free packs' etc. While everyone knows that it's just some phycological tricks to increase playtime, subconsciously they would still head online for these digital rewards that worth basically nothing. But I wonder if these people have ever asked themselves why do they even play a game? For the rewards of the game itself? For me, my answer would always be I play for FUN, and Artifact IS A FUN GAME, and I'm willing to pay for things that can entertain me for hundreds of hours. 

The funny thing is many (not all) ragers spammed 'No' before they even touched draft/tournament. Many of them think it would be as chill as heartstone, as cheap as other free games. Ignoring the fact that its a Trading card game that aims to mimic physical card game (Etc Magic) while doing things physical card games cant achieve, and I think Garﬁeld did a great job. Artifact is a breath of freshness in the current card game meta and provides a place for the hardcore players to settle in. As for those so-called 'gamers' who are obsessed with the 'sugar-coated' products, they 'helped' to create games like 'DIABLO mobile' and shaped the current market. There is nothing wrong about it, but i'd wish they could be kept away from games like this.

Artifact is fun, and I like it this way.



me drone

me not able to see 50% of all game modes where you can use every card for free, forever, me only see how buy card
me only see the single card that cost lot of money, not the 400 that cost 1 pence each
me never play any other TCG so my comparison to how much things should cost bad
me want game free

VALVE ME WANT GAME FREE
Even with it's flaws and missing features, I feel like I need to give this one a positive review just to counter the typical steam-circlejerk around this game. The game does have alot of content for free-players so everything you're reading about the monetization is unfair/flat-out lies.

This has to be the most exciting foundation for a card-game I've ever witnessed; the depth of gameplay is incredible and the amount of ways you can outsmart your opponent even with a sub-optimal deck is infinite.
The Game is great and cheeper as Hearthstone.... U get a full collection for 160€. In HS u get a kick in the ass for 160 € and a wizzbang... 
I realy love the game
Despite the fact, that Artifact had very rough start and it was missing a lot of key features, like an ingame chat, progression system or emotes, I decided to give it a thumbs up. I do like the complexity the gameplay offers. Even though there are currently to less cards to make a lot of deck variety, it´s still enjoyable. Unlike other gaming companies, I do trust Valve, that they will be able to push the game to a better state, that it´s currently in.
It's easy to understand why this game has got so much hate around it. The game is based on the lore and skills of Dota 2, a free to play game.

The free to play audience was and will never be prepared to pay for any product. The poor pinoys skipping school to play Dota can not afford to play this, just as they can not afford to buy their own computer.

This game is a real TCG but in a digital form. It means that there is a monetary aspect to buying the cards, and it comparatively is cheaper when you look at it from a market perspective and being able to buy individual cards.

Dota 2 as a game is far more complex than any other MOBA out there. It requires a kind of gamer who is willing to invest time and energy in learning the game for thousands of hours to truly master it. This game is very similar to that aspect, and so the game design philosophy hasn't changed.

Artifact fan based websites who are offering deck databases have decks you can create which are relatively top tier for less than $10, but even that is too expensive for the poor, poverty stricken and destitute pinoy fan-base of the original Dota 2 game.

At the end, my prediction is the following. The game will be a success as the poor people step aside, and this game will never be free to play since the initial cost is made up for in the card packs you recieve initially.

So my advice would be to buy the game and enjoy it as a more complex and advanced form of TCG compared to Hearthstone and others. If you're not into complexity, then stay in heartstone where the market is internalised and keep grinding.

However, if you're someone like me with a job and isn't living in a third world poverty stricken country trying to feed their families by prostituting themselves and their sisters,  then this game is perfect. You pay, you get cards, you play, and you can stop whenever you like. There is no urgency in "grinding" meaninglessly in order to save $10. My time is far too valuable for that.

Be very cautious when purchasing games that require money and recieving feedback from people who can barely afford a McDonalds happy meal.
An exciting and fun new TCG from Valve.

Lots of the negative reviews are people buying the game, opening it for an hour, writing a bad review and refunding it. Yes, you have to buy decks or singles, there's no free way to grind them out. So? When did we become the kind of society that just expects everything to be free? How dare Valve be paid for their hard work! They should just give us hundreds of hours of work for free because we are willing to sit at a desk for 16 hours and grind the cards out... Go get a job, earn some money, buy some packs.

Or play casual draft which is fun af and free.

I enjoy playing it but it definitely needs some more features and something as far as rewards. It's still good to play in the meantime and feels like a fleshed out game.
Game in a nutshell

UpsetCitizen: This game is pay2pay2pay
Fan: You can play the casual modes
UpsetCitizen: With nothing on the line? The casual modes are not competitive
Fan: Then pay for the damn ticket
UpsetCitizen: I feel bad when i go 0-2 and deserve rewards
Good game.

As for player market prices of cards drops drastically so you can spend less than paying for packs,
you dont need meta cards to have fun so stop complaining.. about P2P

GGWP EZ

I think it's kinda sad that people give random negative reviews for an apparently bad monetization system. 
If you are somewhat lucky and decently talented at drafting, it's absolutely possible to go endless without spending any money. whatsoever. In fact, I've actually made some cash off the game through the market without buying any additional packs but solely through the 10 free packs + draft rewards and I didn't even pull a single Axe. 
I guess the game might not be for everyone but if you enjoy drafting, this is undoubtedly the best card game you can play.
Also, people seem to forget that you can trade-in multiple copies of cards for event tickets, which is yet another reason why drafting is so lucrative in this game.

Anyway, if you don't like the game, go back to Hearthstone and keep grinding your games until you can finally afford that one desired card pack. Yes, Artifact demands you to "grind" as well in the sense of playing a lot of draft games. However, the gameplay is so innovative and you'll always have a lot of variety by playing a different deck every single time which keeps it very enjoyable.

The people who complain about monetization, don't understand it. Yes, there is no way to earn cards perminantely for (((free))) yes the "game" costs 20 dollars, but the game comes with 10 packs, the cost of 10 packs is 20 dollars, so really when you buy the game, you are buying the license to play the game. secondly, anyone can play phantom draft, where you create a deck from opening packs but the deck is discarded once you are done with the guantlet, therefor you don't even need your own cards. Honestly, playing draft is the way to go because people can't just buy epic decks from the market place. which brings up another point, this is the only TCG where you can trade cards with other players, which puts it light years ahead of mtg:a, hearthstone, gwent, scrolls etc etc.
So many complaints from people that don't understand a genre that's been around since before the digital age, I'm a long time Magic the Gathering player and have a collection of physical cards that cost me hundreds. At the moment the game is lacking in few areas such as being able to chat with your opponent but that is planned so it's not a big deal for now.

The biggest complaint I've seen is people being dissapointed in not receiving free cards for progression but they fail to realize that would devalue the cards bought by players, this is a Trading Card Game where your collection holds value unlike the majority of other online card games. This system is better for many reasons but the main would be people can resell their collection when they tire of the game and recoup the majority of money they spent which many people also fail to realise. I can sell the cards I got from my ten free packs and make a profit because I got lucky with afew cards.
As long as free draft gets updated with new expansions and is kept free or nearly free, forever, I will support this game (and will continue to spend money on it). Hope Valve realizes how good it is for the game and players to have a free premium draft option.
kinda pay2win, someway not... IDK!
anyway, the gameplay and graphics and the game machine is amazing!
hate it but love it!
Update: this game is DYING!
despise the first bugs, this game is playable

the microtransactions is seemingly fair compared to the other CCG with no open trade capacity

this game is very hard and your average opponent in phantom draft and casual constructed is sometime better than you
Having a background as Hearthstone coach for the past 5 years, Artifact is a great change for me. I loved the competitive aspects of Hearthstone, but blizzard was never willing to commit more to it. Artifact however is different, and is much more focused on the tournament and esports scene which will be good for the long term. It may be hard for people who don't know much about card games to get into, but with the free practice options, you can take as long as you need to learn the game and jump into the competitive formats.
Artifact is a fantastic CCG.  The game is cleverly designed and requires your brain to be working at 100% if you want to pull off a win.  The basic game concepts are easy to pickup, but it takes a while to really grasp all the strategy of a three board game.

If you like CCGs, or strategy games in general, get Artifact.
Impressive game and the best digital card game ever made. Expensive for kids loving things for free. Its free if play only in standart draft mode (all cards included). Not recommended for low thinking players.
Good mechanism, sfx, enjoyable BGM & Graphic but i need more practice to play this, coz never play this genre

my Biggest disappointment about this game :
(-) Where's Half-Life 3?
cmon gaben
Artifact is one of the greatest CCG game ever to be made. To detail in depth just what makes it so excellent would take a dozen pages at least. Suffice to say that the game is comprised of a multitude of mechanics, each of which is like its own "mini-game" within the larger game. What makes Artifact a masterpiece of a CCG game is that it is so much more than the sum of its parts. The way that the individual elements fit together to make a single whole is simply extraordinary and the result of decades of refinement. 

However, while the game itself is nothing short of a masterpiece, the experience of playing it without spending money is deeply unpleasant. It is fairly common for competitive online games to allow players to sink in money to gain an edge towards their opponents. However, nothing comes close to Artifact, both in the quantity of rigged RNG when opening packs and the degree to which how your draws can negatively impact your experience of playing the game. In Artifact, one terrible card can easily doom your entire deck. As a result of this power, upon drawing a card with sub 60% winrate (according to ArtiBuff), you might as well surrender or AFK and alt tab to your only other game in your Steam library, Dota. Bad cards can be swapped or deleted, but Artifact encourages all cards to be sold on the Steam market, so that Valve can get a cut from the service fees.

The scariest part of all of this is that the last time I checked, I only had about a 50% competitive winrate despite spending more money than I did back when I played Hearthstone, which means that on average, I was matched with players who spent more money than me. This was incredibly frustrating as Artifact is not just a game to me. Winning is everything as I'm trying to pursue an e-sport career just like I did back in Dota (6k MMR wisp main). Nonetheless, I would estimate that at least 20% of my matches were ruined by bad matchmaking: not because the players I got matched with, sunk in more money than me, but because of the game's rigged Forced 50 matchmaking system, which so happens to also exist in Dota, coincidence? This is left up to you to decide. 

I used to play Hearthstone constantly for years and I never once lost my love for the game itself. But eventually, the pandering towards mobile gamers by Blizzard made me give up. The reason that I am recommending Artifact is that there is one easy way to avoid this Forced 50 and RNG gameplay: buy and only use cards that have more than 55% winrate (according to ArtiBuff). When you have a deck of overpowered cards that are part of the meta synergizing with each other, there are few, if any players, who can actually match your skill level. Every card has an essential role to play, and every card can be obtained with enough Steam funds. This is the way the game is intended to be played and I truly cannot overstate just how fun it is.

The bottom line: Artifact is a masterpiece that only shines when the player is not poverty-stricken. Using the cards from the starter pack just isn't viable long term for anyone but seasoned players who are looking for a challenge.
This is a great game, the economic model is good too, most people have to argue about anything that is not given them for free. Gameplay is brilliant and appealing.
My first impressions of Artifact: It's the best game I've ever played. The production value is amazing... the voice overs, the graphic art, and everything is of top quality.

Thank you, VALVe!
Former Heartstone and MTG player for 5+years. the cheap and specific card selection make it so much more enjoyable than other moneygrabbers. ignore bad reviews from12 year olds expecting source 2 in csgo and instead got a card game
I fail to see an issue with the cost of this game, people are saying that it costs too much to play but that is a lie. You can buy the cards you need from the market place so it is not like you need thousands to make a 'competitive' deck.

I found that my favourite mode was the draft anyway so constructed is not that relevant, however if you do choose to play constructed you can earn packs from the 'Expert' constructed/draft modes (Granted you have to win 3 games and you need to spend a ticket). 

Aside from that the game is fantastic, I was an on and off hearthstone player and used to play magic a little bit back in the day and it is refreshing to play a different TCG!
Second edit ( Actual review): Great game with great gameplay, every game forces you to think if you want to win. I am divided between the positive review and the negative one though. The game is great, but it lacks any goal. At all. There is no ranking system.Yes, the game is fun, but will slowly die without ranking system or rewards for the grind. Games like this ( which are infinite and always the same) need goals. Otherwise people will eventually leave it and instead of grinding it for days and days, are only going to play the eventual match for fun. That will make the game as it is have a much smaller playerbase and playtime per player. Second thing is the price. Anyone who says that you do not have to pay money to enjoy this is half lying. Yes you can definetely play the events and use the cards you have to make decks, but they will be crap. Complete crap decks. This is not a turn off for me,since when you buy cards you keep their value (because you have them) and it is just the normal way of a TCG to work. I am just warning people, this game needs extra money dumped on it.
Overall : Great game, great mechanics, really needs some kind of ranking system or tournaments per week, some kind of reward for whoever puts time on it, because right now, it is a ´´Play it for fun game´´, while the game itself is made to be played in an extremely competitive format. Also, if you want to win with your own decks,expect to spend some money.

Edit:  C'mon guys,I can understand some of the negative reviews, but all the ones because they did not get the packs in the first 30 minutes logged in, or the ones saying that the game is too complicated, they make no sense. It`s normal for a game to have troubles in the first hour of launch, just wait an hour and your packs should be there,if not sooner. About it being dificult or confusing...For real? Is that a reason for people to review a game as bad, beause it is harder than what they like? Just move on,do not bash on it. I want this to succeed because I am hyped about it, but I will not say it is good just based on that. Will update this review once I play it for 10 hours.
Its actually not that bad as ppl are saying. Buying the game gives you access to around 1/3 of the total pool of cards. It will require you double the amount to do the same in Hearthstone.
I don't understand why people are complaining about this game because of the payment model. I feel their opinions are incredibly ignorant. Card games in general are pay to win, however the best decks don't always win, its about how you play them. Anyone who played tabletop games such as MTG, Yugioh or Pokemon has to go to the store or order online for cards..they don't just arrive at the store and the salesman hands them cards for free. Furthermore I think it's amazing how i can purchase singles of cards that i want instead of buying just packs and hoping to get the cards i want. I can't tell you how many times i poured money into hearthstone packs to try to get cards i want, and if i didn't i had to disenchant them for less than their actual value to craft the card i want.... that's stupid, and to me that's a cash grab.  This game resembles more of the tabletop environment in a digital environment and i love it. No rng, just evaluating the best cards for your deck and making it work. On top of that the game is pretty, the in game deck builder is awesome, and everything has run smooth so far. I will be playing this game for a long time.
DO NOT LISTEN TO THESE BUTTHURT F2P PLAYERS

Obviously, if you are an absolute f2p player it's impossible to play this game because you would have to buy it. However, spending money in Artifact is much more valuable than spending money in a game like Hearthstone. This is because Hearthstone cards rotate out after a 2 years, and you will have to spend more money to get the newest expansions, but Artifact's cards can be sold and bought once they are out of meta. So if you are willing to put in a reasonable amount of investment into a card game, you can techniqally consider Artifact to be one of the chepeast TCG's out there. 

Gameplay wise, there are no online card games out there that requires as much skill as Artifact. So if you are a card game fan who despises constant RNG, Artifact is the perfect card game for you.

I apologize if I haven't already emphasized it already in my review:

THIS REVIEW DOES NOT APPLY TO GAMERS WHO ARE NOT WILLING TO SPEND ***ANY*** MONEY FOR A GAME.
Dont lisen to the old depressed little sad dark small grannies....The game is good, great fun and for 50 bucks you can play for hours with Tier1 decks. People have TOO MUCH free time to spend in Reddit and forums. 

Go and play the game, it is good
One of the best card games I've played. So many strategies, so many decisions to make. For the people who say this is Pay to win game: 90% of cards are really cheap in market and expensive cards are not too OP. If you are good, its easy to build a strong deck with less than 5-10$ after opening 10 free packs. There were so many games that a 100$+ deck lost to a 10$ deck.
 I'm not sure about the future but at this point, this is not a P2W game.
People should stop asking for free stuff and enjoy the game. This game has so much potential and without doubt will be the next Esports game.  What's the point of TCG if everyone can obtain full collection easily?
Fantastic game and much better monetization than other card games.  Time is money friends.

This game is worth it for the free phantom draft alone.  Just an incredibly fun game all around.
Arrow and flopping position can make things very unpredictable such as missing ancient lethal because 3 creep all arrow on one and only one creep.

Everythingelse is fine though,counter-intuitive for sure, and you have to think ahead not only how to manage to kill opponent heroes, also how to detent them on one lane and stay alive if necessary.
I've never played a card game before, but I love Dota, and Valve has never disappointed me with a game, so I pre-ordered Artifact, and put a whole lot of time and money into it when it came out. I haven't played it for weeks now, mostly because I don't have time (note my profile picture), but I do love the game. Watching tournaments has been really fun ArtifactCinema has some really excellent content (the fails and triumphs videos have been incredible, and the Artifact Podcast has been really interesting), trying different decks and/or card combinations has been fun, and even watching people stream the game has been fun. The problem, and the reason for all the rage on Reddit and in the review section, is that the game should have been released as an "Early Access" title. It was nowhere close to finished when it came out, and, although the patches have made a significant difference, it remains unfinished. There is a lot of potential for Artifact, and I'm excited to see where Valve goes with that potential, so, despite all that it currently lacks, I'll still give it a thumbs up.
As someone who played Magic: The Gathering (MTG) within a year of its release and someone who plays Hearthstone several times a week (and someone who has also played Dota 2 from time to time), I was really looking forward to what Valve and Richard Garfield would deliver with Artifact. Although the game may not have lived up to all the hype, it has met my expectations. All thing equal, Artifact is great card strategy game. It is not without criticism, including its initial pricing model, and although it is not terribly difficult to learn how to play Artifact, it is complex enough that it sometimes does not seem as “fun” (in a casual sense) as Hearthstone. Perhaps Artifact is to Hearthstone what Dota 2 is to League of Legends.  

[b]Gameplay[/b]
Artifact is a turn-based card game, which is great for those of us no longer sporting the reflexes of our teenage years. Player turns are still timed, so you cannot drag games out indefinitely. Artifact matches are a hybrid of MTG, Hearthstone, and Dota 2.  As with the other trading card games, you start with a deck that is built around one or more colors or classes. Unlike the other card games but similar to Dota 2, instead of a single board where the action takes place, you and your opponent face off across three separate lanes guarded by towers. Your goal is to destroy two of your opponent’s towers or destroy one tower twice (although the second time, the tower has considerably more health). Over the course of the game, you get to deploy up to five heroes across your lanes and use them to cast spells or summon minions to battle your opponent’s forces. Artifact is also an interesting combination of calculated decisions on your part with some random elements, such as what lanes your initial three heroes are deployed at the start, what lanes additional minions spawn each turn, and so forth.  Between rounds you also get to buy equipment, a la Dota 2, to strengthen your heroes.  Since Artifact battles are brutal, your heroes will die. Often. But death is not necessarily a bad thing, as two rounds later, you get to deploy them again, at full strength once more.

[b]Characters/Customization[/b]
The initial iteration of Artifact comes with four colors: black, blue, green, and red (and I say initial because MTG also had white in addition to those four). Your deck of cards will consist of spells and heroes of one or more colors. Each color has several heroes that, generally speaking, follow the themes of said color – as do the spells. Deck customization is very similar to what you would encounter in MTG. Unlike Hearthstone, you do not have neutral cards that all classes can use, aside from the equipment that you buy in between rounds. Most of the heroes that appear in Artifact also appear in Dota 2. 

[b]Story/Atmosphere[/b]
Artifact does not have a story per se, but like other trading card games, it does reside in a fantasy setting, that just happens to overlap with the world of Dota 2. 

[b]Graphics/Sound[/b]
The card art, layout, interfaces, etc. all look quite nice. The animations, including those silly looking imps, are well done. Sound effects are fine. The music is also good, except there could be a bit more variety, and after a while, the music starts to sound quite repetitive. I have not encountered any bugs in the gameplay, but for some unknown reason, I continue to see a busted splash screen in the Call to Arms section that apparently has something to do with playing the game on an ultrawide display.  But again, no issues with the gameplay.

[b]Replay Value:[/b] Yes. This is the type of game that you have to play multiple times to become better at it.  

[b]Overall Score:[/b] 9/10.

[i]Played in 2018 - .[/i]
Still feels like needs some game mode improvements.

Gameplay feels smooth and the general concept is great. Card balances are ok for an online game too, might not be the best way to integrate with the marketplace, but hopefully they fix this.

I trust Valve, Artifact is just pretty new.
This is the only digital card game I care to play. The core gameplay is unique and differentiates itself from Magic: The Gathering and all it's clones. The core fundamentals are very strong, though the base set is a bit bland (all base sets are). Getting into it now is great because card prices are cheap - despite all the complaints about "P2W" (I'm not sure what people expected, it's a CCG), it's cheaper and easier to acquire the cards you want than any other digital card games out there. No opening packs, recycling cards, grindy skinner box nonsense. Just buy only the cards you need directly if you want to construct a deck - most cards cost nothing. If you don't want to spend a single cent aside from the price of the game, draft is also incredibly fun and costs nothing. 

(NB: A lot of negative reviews seem to cite low playerbase as a complaint. I've never understood that sentiment, coming from a board game background where many online implementations have double digit player counts.  You never need to wait more than 20 seconds for a match anyway so who cares?)


Best DTCG game I have ever play. But not recommended if you don't enjoy fast pase deep strategic game.
Otherwise it gives you the most advanced DTCG experience ever!
Recommended slightly. Heres why, as a card game its fine. You have your offensive cards, defensive cards, resources, creatures, spells, win cons, etc. All the things you need for the card game to actually function. Many of the cards feel balanced and it does give you a wide variety of strategy. You also have a real money market which I prefer over a crafting and or pack opening only game. So there you have it, all the things you need to make a playable card game. 

However I still want to talk about what I dont like. The win conditions feel like a lot, you can win a game by destroying two towers or a core. It seems like a lot to focus on with three lanes, most players coming from other card games are used to just a straight one on one field and might have trouble adapting. Its almost like playing three games at once where you can ignore one or two players and just focus on killing another one or two. The RNG is around Heartstone level and everyone loves Hearthstone RNG so no problem there. I mean who doesnt enjoy not only drawing random cards but also getting random minion placement, random heroes, random items from the shop, you get it. 

But, the rules are understandable and ill be damned if I didnt have fun playing the twenty or so matches I played.
A card game with unrived debth and skill, really fun with friends with lots of potential. Valve showing lots of desire to work with the community and listen to thier feedback. This game will only get better with more expansions.
every update artifact had since release has gone in the right direction in my opinion. it fortells an excellent card game with excellent Quality of life improvements.

the game is immensely fun if you're into cardgames and the strategy involved with them.

don't expect short and easy games. if you dont have more than 10 minutes of time, dont start a game without considering the possibility to have to forfeit the game.
you need to time an concentration for this game, but each game itself is an incredibly rewarding experience.

the way the game plays feels more like a board game, and its best enjoyed if you have friends who play or get them to play this game together with you.

if you dont have the money for a full collection, but you still want to play constructed, there is the supported "Pauper" format (only commons), where a full deck of your choice wont cost more than 2$/€. Other formats may or maynot be added in the future, but i'd bet on the former.

if you play versus a friend, there is the possibility to share decks with them so they can test out your deck or vice versa
Please dont die. Give this game a chance. You 20 packs and 15 event cards total for leveling up and most of the cards are not even that expensive. Very fun fun game

In other card games most of the 90% of the skill comes from deck building. In artifact you have more opportunites due the number of lanes ,items and cards
Finally, a collectible card game that runs on Linux...

I think Artifact is a game with great potential that's been plagued by some serious issues. However Valve appears to be making progress towards these issues, in their last patch they nerfed some overpowered cards, introduced a ladder system, and introduced a way to obtain packs without having to pay.

Gameplay is fun and engaging, I never feel like I'm ever locked-out of the game, there's always a chance for me to make a comeback if my opponent misplays and likewise I have to be on guard even if I feel like I have the game in the bag. The interactions between the cards don't seem too mired in RNG, and the concept of re-spawning heros and signature cards is fascinating.

My criticism is that the games are too long, there's too much time to invest for each game. This isn't something you would casually play while waiting for the bus like in Hearthstone. Likewise losing a game feels that much more painful because of how long each game takes. I feel that you don't earn card packs (for free) fast enough. I feel that Valve would be better off releasing this game as free-to-play. And I feel like the gameplay could be strengthened by introducing a faster meta and additional mechanics.

However I feel that criticisms of this game being 'pay to play' are somewhat valid but far exaggerated. I've been having a lot of fun without paying anything but the sale price. Phantom Draft is enjoyable, the current guantlet game mode allows you to play with around 8 very powerful multi-colored decks, and you can use these same decks in private games with friends. You only really need to pay when you're building a custom competitive deck and when you look at how much card packs cost in Hearthstone, how many cards they give, and how much rarer the good cards are, I suspect that Artifact isn't particularly expensive, it's just honest about the prices for cards (which you can buy direct off the marketplace). Collectible Card Games are expensive if you want to play competitively.

All the issues I've mentioned above can be fixed with patches. And since I'm running Ubuntu as my main operating system and Hearthstone and Gwent don't run on Linux, beggers can't be choosers. Overall I've been having a lot of fun with Artifact (more than I thought I would) so I'll recommend it to my friends (although none of them want to play after all the mixed reviews).
This game is quite possibly the most mixed reaction I've ever had for a game EVER. There are SO many things this game does right, but the single thing the game does wrong holds all of that back. 

The voice acting is great. The art for the cards are great. The three-lane concept and execution is great. The shop is a cool idea, if a bit poor in balance I personally think. The cards are fun, and whether I win or lose, I don't exactly feel like it was due to the RNG.

However, the one thing that holds the game back is the monetization, obviously. You have to pay an entry fee of 20 dollars, you get around 15 free packs, and that's it. No quests like in Hearthstone that allow you to obtain gold/currency to grab some packs, no free packs from a weekly win or something like that, nothing. I wouldn't care about that if there was no entry fee, or if the entry fee was something like 5 dollars instead. It makes me so conflicted, because correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Valve worth a ton? Don't they have money machines in the form of CS:GO cases and keys, every purchase made on the Store and Market on Steam, the occasional burst of income from the Dota 2 International Battle Pass? Again, I may be incorrect, but I don't understand why the level of greed with this game. It has such unbelievable potential to be quite possibly the best and most unique card game out there, but it's held back by what destroys most good games these days: greed.

At the end of the day, I still recommend the game. The pros do outweigh the con, but barely. I've always had a lot of faith in Valve, some would call me a shill, but I think they're at least a little bit competent. I only hope that they continue to roll out improvements and listen to the community on the main issues they have.
I like Artifact and think it has a lot of potential, Valve seems to be more interested in realizing that potential but i think the games probably a few adjustments away. That being said the basic gameplay is interesting and there doesn't seem to be braindead stratedgies currently. The game is fun though, and the monetisation is pretty good. I was extremely concerned when i heard it was going to be a open market because paying 200$ for an OP card is absolute shit, no i don't care that MTG people do it this is a computer game and i expect to spend on it similar levels to any other computer game. THankfully that's not how its played out at all. I would say the game is much much MUCH cheaper than HS currently, both to play one good deck and to play multiple good decks (usually a single good deck in HS is pretty cheap but if you want to actually have some variety in your life you are going to have to shell out the benjamins)

Things i would like addressed 

-Better spectate like hearthstone, i know you can use the built in steam spectating tool but its absolutely terrible and you can't just hop in and watch your friends play they have to go through and give permission and shit. I think in every way other than spectating the client is just way better than HS but i seriosuly miss easily watching my friends play

-Casual Draft integrity Fix. I like playing casual draft it's my favorite mode but currently there is a lot of people that "scum" their decks until they get an OP one that is above average of what you should be getting in a draft. I think this really hurts the mode and Valve should add some sort of Cooldown on retiring your deck so people actually have play the ones they draft that arn't great, atleast a little bit. 

- Chiller Music. Kinda a weird thing to bring up, i want to listen to the music but its so overly epic that i had to turn it off. I feel like i have the final battle of a fantasy movie or some shit playing in the background. I wouldn't call the music bad at all it's just really not what im looking for while playing a card game lol. 

That's about it. Good game and i am sure it will just get better over time.
As someone who comes from a ccg background the cost curve on playing this game is amazing. As someone who comes from any other type of gaming (other than mobile) perspective the cost curve is pretty steep. 
Regardless I'm having a blast playing this game. While the random lane assignments for minions and aggro directions can be frustrating at times, you quickly learn to only focus on one to two lanes and work around the randomness in those.
I've yet to play a match and find it to be unwinnable. While my luck is usually pretty bad I still find this game to be fun.
I'm not sure what all the hate is for. This game is a blast. There are plenty of options to earn decks or play with draft/prebuilt sets if you do not wish to purchase more cards.
Phantom draft should be promoted as the main/only way to play this game. Mechanically it's incredible and is one of the least RNG dependent games. RNG exists but it's very mitigable, much more so than HS or MTG.  With the recent patch it's clear that they are committed to providing a balanced experience by nerfing and buffing when necessary. 

Cards/packs are on the pricier side but you do get to keep them and it evena non-issue if all you care about playing is Phantom Draft. 

I really enjoyed Artifact. It has much more depth than other Card Games (Heartstone). You have a lot of choices how to play your cards every turn.

I also think, while it is not free to play, its much cheaper to build a collection because cards are not as seldom as in other TCGs. You get one card of the highest rarity with every pack!

And if a special card is missing, you can just buy it instead of having to dust packs....
Disclosure: This review is based on Artifact as a card game, not the controversy.

Artifact is Valve's attempt into the digital TCG market. It makes a great start and it is expected that the game will improve in depth as more expansions are added. In terms of price the game is in fact cheap that the alternatives in both money and time.
Enjoying this game quite a bit.  Best part is Phantom Draft, where you don't even need to buy any cards.  You "Draft" a deck, and then see if you're deck is better than theirs.  It's pretty satisfying to pull off if done correctly.
It's a pretty good and fun game. They're improving some of the kinks with each update, so soon it might even be a great game. But I recommend it regardless, if you like card games.
Despite the backlash, it's not bad! And considering Valve didn't do much in the last 5 years (I mean no new non-vr game (saliens doesn't count!)), it's great seeing they actually released a game instead of forgetting about it.

Personally this is the first digital card game I have ever played, and it was a positive experience so far!
Now as Volvo listened to us..there are ways to earn packs by leveling up. we have a chat wheel and a leader to climb up..IDK when will they announce the leaderboards
The game is fun yet frustrating..tho I'll suggest you guys to buy and play
And don't look at the negative comments now...they're too lazy to change them
10/10 for me
[h1]Who am I and why consider this review as helpful?[/h1]
I play Hearthstone for over 4 years (wild and standard, reached legend) and Dota 2 since I was a kid (Ancient rank). Obviously like most people Artifact caught my attention immediately but the "pay to play" model they introduced disappointed me. After revealing the last 2 expansions I decided to try it, since valve finally started listening to the community. So let's look at every aspect of the game:

[h1]The most important one is money. [/h1]
Most people want to spent an amount on the game and not be forced to spent more. I feel like Dota's model is the ideal model right now and maybe Artifact can steal a couple ideas. People want to spent money just to enjoy the game more (with cosmetics etc) not for the shake of playing the game, after all when you pay for something you want to be able to play it. Right now they added more free packs and tickets and IF you are good enough you can keep grinding more and more for free and maybe at some point have some good cards and play constructed. The other option is the bad one, buy packets or cards from the market. Why is it bad? Because you are practically forced to buy them if you want to play constructed, even a few decks. Hearthstone on the other hand offers you enough tools and packs to be able to craft and play some decks and if you want to try more then you have to buy some packs. [b] The whole point is that the company should make you want to buy packs, not force you. [/b]  So what more can they do? One solution is add more free packs after leveling up or doing achievements, but make those cards un-tradable. That way you can play some decks and have cards for even more, the cards will have no value since they are untradable, and since you will be missing 1-2 key cards you will WANT to buy them in order to have that awesome deck. Overall after playing 3 days only draft, i feel like I wont be able to play constructed for like the next 4 months unless I spent money, but after the original 18euro why give more, there is no incentive. Even if I buy some packs or card I will be missing more.

[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]
The gameplay honestly feels really good, Hearthstone feels so slow compared to this.  There is much skill involved and remembering many variables. There is some random factor of course like most card games and thinking about it is also a skill. So pacing is fast, skill ceiling is high, deep card and mechanics knowledge  is required. Overall it is a great game, too bad I can only play draft :/ Unless you play it watching it makes no sense, so try playing the tutorial if there is a friend who bought it.

[h1]Graphics and Sound are great.[/h1] 
Some optimization is probably needed, the GPU is like running Dota 2 but this is a card game so something is probably not right. The imps are amazing, the starting game intro also. Cards drawings are ok, I feel they could do a better job. 3d spell animations are really interesting and unique. Music is very cool but probably needs more tracks to not feel repetitive. Finally, voice lines are amazing. 

Conclusion, this is a really good game and it shows great potential, quality will only go higher. However, a game needs players. Most people face the paywall really skeptical. Moreover the after effect of having to pay more in order to enjoy even the basic aspects of the game is what drives people away.
This is a good and very well polished card game, the gameplay is rewarding and the strategy aspect of having three lanes gives it an immense amount of depth. I feel like people do not give this game the chance it deserves and that is largely due to pack mentality and the absolutely mind bothering decision on valves part on how to advertise the game, still that doesn't keep me from having fun. I especially recommend draft, which is entirely free, as constructed really needs another set of cards to show its full potential.
Although there are some bugs , but this game shows excellent originality and  teriffic complicacy. But I have to say , Aritfact is  extremely expensive!!!
Gameplay is super fun. Draft is the best mode. Valve quickly sorted the overpowered cards, lack of progression, and economy issues. This game is definitely worth it.
The game is mechanically brilliant and leaves an incredible amount of room for improvement with a high skill ceiling. Game is absolutely worth the $20 if you largely want to play draft. You can earn packs by playing the game and leveling up, but if you want to commit hard to constructed, expect to put a little more money into the game. The market place makes it super easy to buy individual cards or you can try your luck with packs. In my opinion, this game is incredible on execution of concept and mechanics that keep me wanting more. I look forward to seeing how this game develops and grows.
Glad to see the changes made to the game. Cheapest TCG to be competitive in. I still play Hearthstone (when mobile) and MTG:A (when I just want to bust out my dailies), but enjoy this game more for the time being. 

Excited to see where expansions take this.
I'll copy/paste what I said on Reddit: its a digital card game that i wont have physically  stolen, that gets updates to change cards instead of getting banned, that gets me free cards for trading and allows me to buy/sell individual cards. I've been playing card games since i was seven and i would have murdered for this.

It's a market run by valve,  using an already available system and economy and allows me to get what i want without dropping fifty bucks to maybe, maybe get the cards I want like hearthstone. 

I can't recommend this game enough if you're an MTG fan. If you're a hearthstone player, give it a shot. Seriously. Getting two premade decks and a bunch of cards makes it an easy buy in. It's more expensive to go play at a local Friday Night Magic
Dumb player base that doesn't understand how great this game is compared to every competitor on the market. It's not p2w and I've made more valve funny money than any other digital card game. Anyone trying to claim it's p2w is below the 50% winrate and will not be missed in a competitive card game. You can go and turn your starting tickets into triple-quadruple your starting packs. There's only one card game out there that can allow that high of a reward and it's reserved for higher than 80% winrate which is a minimal portion of players. The gameplay is by far the best feature, read another review for that. I'm just sick and tired of all the people wishing it was f2p so they can grind for years always being a day and dollar behind but leave a positive review. Stop wanting games to be ruined with shitty f2p models that prey on anyone willing to support the developers.
I understand why some people may be upset, since this game is going to cost you quite a bit of money. At the end of the day though, if you go in understanding that this is a card game first and foremost, and a damn good one at that, you will enjoy your time playing artifact. I am not a fan of the recent update, but it has not ruined the game for me in any way, just changed a few things. There's a lot to like here and ways to play without spending more than that initial $20, a worthy investment.
To everyone who gave a negative review because of no progression, no free and grind rewards, no card balance and market is top priority, be sure to update your reviews.
This is one of my favorite games right now. So much strategy goes into each game, I'm always on the edge of my seat. Valve  has been listening to the community and quick with updates. The card market is nice and I don't feel bad after spending $50 to get 80% of the cards (I never got anything good from packs in Hearthstone. Never played enough to grind extra packs). Only downside to this game is the community right now. So many people are extremely negative. It gets the developers to listen, but the critisism should be more constructive.. "Cheating death 50/50? Game dead LUL".
With the recent changes and commitment to future updates to cards to improve the health of the game, I can firmly recommend picking this up.

Easily my favorite card game on the market at this time.  Each turn has so many strategic options that it feels overwhelming at first, and while it somewhat feels like you've "seen" each deck before after a lot of games, that is only due to needing more card releases, which hopefully will happen fairly early next year.
My 2 cents: this is the first time I've reviewed a game on steam, I was on the fence about buying into Artifact because of the monetization model and other common complaints (overpowered spells, unbalanced heroes etc., detracting from the overall experience and resulting in a narrow metagame). However, since the most recent patch I feel good about recommending it unreservedly. There's a lot of value for the initial purchase price and with the progression system a way to grind for new packs without having to spend additional money. Most importantly the game is fun, go read about it elsewhere =)

Regarding the marketplace, I added a small amount to my steam wallet to build a couple of pauper decks and as a newcomer I found it very simple to use. So overall, good job Valve I guess =)
The most enjoyable and engaging TCG that I've ever played. 

Many negative reviews for this game were previously justified, but Valve has shown that they're listening to the community, and have taken all the right steps since launch. Highly recommended.
Only complaint is that the items with the update should have been there since launch. First card game ever (been playing Dota since wc3), and am having a blast.
Best 1v1 experience I have had since StarCraft. The decisions and order of the decisions matter in a similar sense to that of chess. Tons of depth and the developers have made great balance decisions post release. I recommend this game.
There are lots of decision points and each and every one of your decisions will either move you closer to victory, or further from it. Winning or losing, it's up to you.

Never felt I was as much in control of the outcome of my matches while playing other cardgames. Well done Valve!
Insanely good gameplay: Probably has the best gameplay out of the existing digital TCGs

Monetization model is fair: In-line with other TCGs, but probably not as generous as the F2P CCGs

Progression system needs more work: Recent patch introduced a rudimentary progression system, which still needs to be fleshed out.


A good game overall. Props to the Valve for listening to feedback and rolling out updates as fast as they can.
They gave what they promised. I am really proud and satisfied that valve did what everyone had issues with. I hope the game goes in this right direction. They will have my support at this point more and more. 

Thank you for listening to the right comments from the community 
I recommend everyone this game if they are into card games because this is the best and most fair one so far. 

Peace out!
-Cheapest card game on the market (competitive deck from 16€ to 40€ atm)
-Most skill intensive card game on the market.
-Most beatiful card game on the market.
-Innovative gameplay (not HS nor Magic clone)
-Valves (listen to community concerns in a timely manner)

->profit?
With the recent changes to its economy and the introduction of ranks (even though a true ladder would be a lot better), in addition to valves change of heart on balance patches (they will balance cards now) this game is on its path to be exactly what it was designed to be. A digital card game for the hardcore strategically minded player. It feels like a counterweight to Hearthstone's simple and sometimes dull design which can feel as if you are on autopilot. 
Artifact amazes me with its extremely well designed mechanics and sophisticated gameplay and I can safely recommend it.
For me, who likes a less-toxic and mind-wrestling game, and spends a reasonable amount of money on my hobbies,  it is definitely worth it. This is the very first time that I am giving a review on steam, and I might as well have it about Artifact.

Yes, this is a game that could be very expensive, but I do not mind thinking of the fact that I might have had spent much more on the IRL Magic The Gathering than the total amount that I will be spending here on Artifact. 


This game has changed since launch! It's definitely improved and given what I know about how Dota 2 has continued to receive love in the form of new content, features, patches, and such from the same parent company of Valve- well I just have faith this game will continue to get better! Plus as a TCG that will actually balance it's cards it's only going to become more fun gameplay-wise. I call this my favorite card game alongside playing commander format of Magic the Gathering. Both are highly complex at times, but allow you the freedom to really earn the win.
I absolutely love this game. No other card game has ever made me feel more in control of the outcomes of each match. Any match I win, I feel like i outplayed the opponent and any game I lose, I notice points where I made mistakes that led to it. RNG definitely exist in Artifact, but it's almost always something you can interact with before the outcome is settled. The more skilled player wins a much much larger percent of the time.

Valve's recent about face on balance and economy paradigms have given me an extra layer of respect for the game. Choosing to balance actively, including nerfs AND buffs to cards is very important in a game where such iconic heroes are so core to a game. To have a favorite hero card be bad and stay bad would've been very sad, but instead Valve decided it would be worth balancing very aggresively and actively, which I think was by far the better decision.  Not only that, but Valve has shown great understanding of their game and its balance with the first round of nerfs and buffs to cards. Strong cards maintained playability despite being nerfed while weak cards were made playable and even given new roles.

The change in economy to include some free card packs for playing a decent amount each season was an excellent choice. Player retention early on was poor due to a lack of achievement other than self fufilment and the new grindable card packs helps fix that greatly. It makes the game more accessible and more affordable to a wider audience which is key to becoming more than a niche game.

The tournament system built into the game is one of its greatest features and has helped connect me to different communities of players to get more out of the game. Being able to post a link and have up to 128 players join for a competitive environment for draft or constructed tournaments for FREE is truly incredible and is a large portion of how I spend my time playing Artifact.

Most of the issues I had with the game were fixed within the first three weeks of launch. As long as they continue their upward trajectory of excellent patches and awesome new features, this game is in for a bright future.

Pros:
-Skill wins over luck in every match
-Variety of deck archetypes
-Variety of ways to play, free and paid
-New progression includes free to play options
-Valve has shown competence in nerfing and buffing cards
-Tournament system is incredible
-Draft mode is excellent and well balanced.

Cons:
-Rough launch means lower player count than one would hope.
-Progression is shallow for now (Expect additions in the near future though)
-Buy to play only
-While less expensive in general than Hearthstone or similar analogs. It's harder to grow your collection unless you're a good player.

TL:DR - Fantastic game, excellent features, great balance team, well polished, and exciting future. Light barrier to entry from buy to play model.
Love it. Even more since progression system is implemented. We can buy cards individually so making a deck is actually cheap compared to other digital card games.
Within a month, they listened to the community and fixed the game based on what the community wanted.
So, be confidence in valve on fixing the game in a long run.
Great core mechanics & awesome draft experience. Has some RNG elements but it is still skill-based.

The game lost the majority of its players just weeks after release due to monetizing strategy.
Valve listened to the community and adapted quickly. Latest update added a ranking system and nerfed some of the ultra-op/cheating cards. 

Hopefully the game grows its audience over time.
I play exclusively constructed and I am very pleased to see the direction the game is going. I enjoyed the game even before the patch, but was starting to get mildly frustrated. The patch sets a very good precedent that the game will be atteneded to and it went above and beyond not only addressing pretty much every major issue the community had with the game including adding free packs for playing, profile progression, nerfing overpowered cards, and where they went beyond was buffing underpowered cards. Cards that were otherwise strictly worse than similar cards now have unique buffs to make them much more exciting.

As soon as the patch dropped, I made a Cheating Death deck because I wanted to have a sacrifice deck but did not like relying on the randomness of the card. (For reference, Cheating Death used to have a 50% chance to save a unit each time it would die, now you activate it to save 1 unit per turn.) This change made cheating death more fun to play for both sides of the board.

Lion is another card that has been buffed and I am currently having a lot of fun playing a deck centered around a long term control plan with many cards with persistent effects that eventually stack up to overwhelm the opponent.

It is good to see that Artifact likely won't just die out and I plan on continuing to enjoy the game and will continue to pester my friends into buying it.


Cost:
I have spent about $60-70 USD on the game. If you plan to play Draft the game will never cost more than the $20 base cost. As mentioned at the start of the review I play only constructed, and have been able to build just about every deck I've wanted. 

There are some very good cards that run from $2-5 that you may need a few of, but since they are so good their use carries over between decks, otherwise most cards are on about 10 cents. Going in with a Budget of $40-60 dollars should be enough to enjoy constructed.
The game is great for people who like complicated card games with a lot of options and interesting skill decisions without it turning into a deterministic baggage like chess or go. Right now with only the first set some of the stuff is a bit vanilla and it's only after Valve's first big patch (balance + progression + MMR ranking) that I'd recommend the game.

But man, the draft is so much fun and you literally get as much of it you want for free after you buy in. Very hard to say if you'll like it as many card game players like the simplicity of other games but to me this is a nice not too far step up that makes most matches into tough and engaging puzzles rather than "just" curving out and playing your obvious choices.
High complexity and skill intensive game while still retaining the fun aspect of luck and probabilities that card games typically have. The art work and design on cards is also very good.
I want to write a fair review in hopes that everyone understands the pros and cons of the game. The game has its own issues, but has found a place in my heart. So here it goes.

The good:
•	Gameplay - It is fun and at the same time complex enough. It feels like you have so many options to decide plays at any turn. You have enough cards in your hand to make pretty complex plays and even think one or two turns ahead. Thinking about what cards your opponent might have in his hand and what he could play, gives a lot of advantage. The game has a lot of randomness to it, but your choices feel impactful and mitigate the randomness.
* Economy – you can buy any card you want from market place. You do not have to grind for days and open packs for a chance to get the card you want. It is much fairer than games like Hearthstone. When buying the game you get basic set of cards, 5 boosters and option to unlock further 15 boosters. If you don’t like some of the cards you can sell them. Sure some of them will lose value with time and Valve takes a cut on the top, but at least you can sell them for something.
•	Game modes – there are multiple ones you can choose. Everyone is complaining about Prize play, but it is not mandatory to play it. It is a pretty though mode - you need to be really good or lucky to win it. I think it should stay the way it is – it needs to be though to win booster packs. If you don’t like the mode, just don’t play it. In standard modes you are able to grind for rank, so it’s good enough incentive to play the game.
•	Competitive – many competitive communities have popped up. Players are willing and seeing the game as big potential for eSports. Will it succeed is a different question.
•	Support – Valve has shown with multiple games, that they are willing to support and improve their games. They are listening to their community and trying to fix the issues that are present. I think that the support for this game during first 2 years should be quite good. Let’s see what happens afterwards. Might be that the game will be dropped, like many others (TF2, CSGO, L4D).

The bad:
•	Current state - the game has been released in an unfinished state. There are many features missing – like game history, player profiles, demos etc. After release it came as barebones product as it could be. It still need a lot of patches and updates. Valve has shown that they are willing to work on the issues, but question is whether the community will stay long enough to see those issues get resolved.
•	Player, viewer counts – because of the game state many players decided to leave the game. This of course has impact also on money flow for Valve and general game health. Currently it does not seem to be an issue and the game is slowly recovering. 
•	Game complexity – for new players and viewers the game might seem to complex, therefore it might seem hard to get into it.

Superb gameplay - arguably best card game there

Game had some issues during release (card balance, game progression) but all were adressed in 3 weeks from release.
While this game is much more complicated than any other card game I have played, the mechanics used are very interesting and make the game really engaging. This game is not simple and misplays often greatly impact the game. Overall, I would say this game is great and with the patch that valve just released, continued support should be great and continue to bring life into the game. Also this game is really very cheap compared to other similar games once you get past the initial $20 investment(Mtg starter decks are around the same price). With the addition of ranks and the ability to unlock packs through progression every season really leave a lot of content on the table, not to mention the superb draft modes, there is plenty of fun to be had for $20.
Very engaging and complicated card game. I don’t mind the economiy’s structure and much prefer it to F2P models that require either excessive grinding or a ton of money. Gameplay is solid except for a few minor issues such as the camera. I haven’t encountered any glitches that detract from the game either.
A game I looked forward to for ages and disappointed on initial release with their pricing model and design Philosophy, but with their new outlook and card nerfs / buffs along with progression and rewards I would highly recommend this game to any card game lover for the great and intricate gameplay and a game with a bright future.
The underlying systems of Artifact are extremely compelling. This is one of the most fascinating card game systems I've played and I've played a lot of them at this point in my life.

That's why I was really disappointed when the game released and the backlash against almost every facet of the game happened. People tore into the economy/market, the lack of features (this is a fair point), RNG, stale constructed meta, the paywall, and whatever else they found issue with. I watched the player numbers plummet day after day all while lurking a variety of communities looking for well thought-out critiques of the game amongst the shit-posting. And I realized that if the game wasn't made by Valve we would not have seen nearly as much vitriol and one of my favorite games would of died.

But thankfully this game system is indeed being developed by Valve. And after some radio silence, they released two updates back to back directly addressing many of the concerns raised by the larger community. While it's early to see if those changes are enough to sustainably turn the ship around; I've already noticed anectodally a lot more "content" being produced on youtube about the game. Before, there was barely any and I went searching for it. Communities are buzzing now, and while there's still detractors and trolls the discourse isn't a trash fire anymore.

Valve wasn't going to let the game die and it's very promising to me that they listened to feedback and did some complete turn arounds on the initial vision for the game, namely in progression and card balancing. Callously, you could say that it's a pure business decision and I don't doubt that's a factor; but it's also an extreme sign of maturity and humility for a group of people to take a hard look at their creative project and admit maybe the initial vision wasn't the best for the current state of digital card games.

[b]TL:DR: Game came out, bombed. Valve made some big decisions overturning some initial design decisions and now I think this game has a bright future ahead of it.[/b]
Really enjoying the game. It's refreshingly challenging, especially after years with hearthstone. The recent balance changes make it even better too and show that valve is willing to engage with its community.
Overall great mix of physical and digital card game elements to create a complex and engaging competitive experience. Hope to see more of what Artifact has to offer.
An in-depth card game where wins are a testament to skill rather than RNG.
Business model isn't as terrible as it looks on the surface. Competing in draft is 100% free and the cost of competitive decks are very reasonable.
The gameplay and draft modes are fun, definitely a unique game. People are complaining about the model but I've definitely got at least $20 worth, and it sounds like the patches are adding more features.
Free drafting is incredible value, and the way you can't really tell who will win a game till the very end makes each game exciting. It's impressive how it always feels like there might be a way to turn a game around, even if you get off to a bad start. Constructed is lacking at the moment but it's purely down to the limited card pool which will improve as expansions come.
Claims about the cost of playing the game are overblown significantly. It's a TCG, it's going to cost money to play competitively. However, the costs in my mind are very reasonable, especially if you are looking to actually play the game.  A lot of the complaints center around the poor ROI, but for someone like myself, that has little significance.  TCG's in general tend to be massive money pits. Artifact is not like the other big TCG's that cost an outrageous amount of money to play competitively. People throwing a fit are the people that were hoping this was going to be a a big investment opportunity in a sense. They view games like Artifact as more of a stock market than a game. If you want to play a very well designed card game relatively inexpensively, give it a chance. You will probably be happy you did.
Artifact is a fun game, but everything related to the non-game aspect is pretty rushed.
In the last patch Valve nerfed some of the best cards into being good cards, and buffed some of the worst cards, something I was not expecting.

The new leveling system is pretty bear bones, the daily quest system is just as bland and boring(It is just first win of the day)

The game still needs a lot of work, but the recent two patches show that the people at Valve are willing to listen and try different things, hopefuly it's a sign of things to come. Do not buy this game based on what might happen, but on what it has right now, a solid game with poor progression/ reasons to come back every day.

For anyone on the fence, maybe wait for another patch or two to see if the game is still being developed for properly, valve has a tendency of adding features and then forgetting to work on them.


Artifact keeps going in the right direction. We now have a progression system (albeit a pretty weak one), rankings and most importantly, balance changes (and a commitment from Valve to keep doing them). I feel like Artifact has the potential to be one of the best card games, and we are starting to see that in practice.
Artifact is an amazing card game that feels rewarding when you win and almost always teaches you a lesson when you lose. Yes it has RNG but it is structured in a way that allows you to play around it. You wont get many free wins or loses like in other card games, and you have many options to navigate your way to victory.

I also want to comment on the negative reviews that expect the game to allow you to grind to a competitive constructed deck, like Hearthstone. This game is, in my experience, about draft and you can play this even-playing-field format as much as you want. 
It also has a really neat pre-constructed game mode thats alot better than i would expect from other card games. 
If you really want a tier 1 constructed deck the cards are fairly cheap compared to other card games and can be resold.

Id highly recommend this game to anyone who are fans of other card games and are looking for a rewarding and deep challenge.
This game is AWESOME. Feels like a tabletop game.. And thats GOOD! Its a card game, and at the same time it feels like a "complex" strategy game. Like a boardgame. COOL.

With the new patch, Valve just showed us, that they REALLY are in for the long haul. Listening to the people. 

Dont know, I fucking love this game. Feels like most pro streamers did aswell, and if they didnt have like 10x the viewers playing HS, they would def be playing this instead.. This game is cool. really.
Game offers the best gameplay out of all other card games on the market. With the recent update featuring balance and economy changes it's definitely worth playing!
This game is a truely deep Card Game.  The company is willing to buff/nerf cards that need it.  I personally love being able to buy singles off the market and not just buy packs like other card games. You can look back on games you lost and realize things you did wrong. Winning feels great and satisfying.

A FIVE..... out of FIVE.
At first the game probably wasnt worth it due to its play to play nature. since the last few updated this has mostly changed and it shows that Value is aware of the problems and is trying to move the game in the right direction. I think now after the leveling system was introduced the game is certainly worth it.

The gameplay is (in my opinion) the most enjoyable of the currently available card games and offers alot more than its competition for a completely new game.
The amazing update last evening (December 20th 2018) has hands down saved the game. 

There is now a progression system (level up your account and get free cards) and MMR skill ranking. Competitive players rejoice!

And last but certainly not least, Valve has gone back on a previous statement and have now demonstrated that they are willing to make balance changes to existing cards (free market be damned). The main balance issues (Axe,  Cheating Death, Drow) have all been mega clapped with the nerf bat. They even tweaked an item (Jasper Daggers) to give deck builders a powerful counter to stuns and silences. 

My personal favorite changes have been the buffs to some of the dumpster heroes (eg. Lion). His special ability got its cooldown heavily buffed, which should make for some very exciting gameplay.

Got 60+ hours so far in this kid's card game and still loving every second of it. It's ocean's away the most advanced and exciting card game out there. HS is preschool. Gwent is elementary school. Artifact is Stanford.
Great game. Draft mode is very challenging and balanced I'd say, which makes it appealing to me. Adding more cards in the future will make it even more fun. High skill ceiling, a lot of strategic thinking required. The game being based on the dota universe is the cherry on top. WIll be playing this game for years to come for sure.

I understand some peoples frustrations. But this game is only 3 weeks old, and make no mistake about it - valve will keep making more changes in a positive direction just as they do with every other title they own. Worth every dollar, especially considering the price is actually prepaying for ingame content. You can play the game for free after that and still have tons of fun just like I do.
I highly recommend the game. Get a handful of packs and tickets for buying + progression to earn seasonal packs and tickets (up to 15 this season). Free phantom draft, open tournaments, global ladders for events, a ranking system, and cosmetic avatar awards for climbing seasonal levels.

The gameplay is very deep and engaging, but not as easy to pick up as other digital card games. It's more in-line with what you could expect from an LCG by Fantasy Flight Games. And much like those games, the game is very rewarding once you get into it.

The last major pro for the game is that Valve has shown to be VERY RECEPTIVE to player feedback and has already addressed multiple talking points among the community.
Artifact is a solid internet trading card game.  The novel approach to game play with three boards played each turn is extremely engaging and challenging, forcing a broader awareness and a deeper strategic approach than most other games.  The system with heroes and creeps creates a dynamic environment where characters shine, allowing for a lot of fun plays and tough decisions.  Several modes, events, and an excellent tutorial make this a full and rewarding card game experience.

The market is a big draw for Artifact.  Valve recently introduced an option to unlock cards and event tickets through progression, but the primary system of buying and selling cards through the steam market remains a fantastic inclusion.  No more depending on RNG for packs - buy the specific cards you want, sell the ones you don't need.  It's an excellent inclusion for the game, and really helps competitive play be more accessible.

This is a great game, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes card games and strategy games.
If you like complex and deep card games you’ll like thos game. If you want to play on autopilot and just relax you won’t. 

While its not free to play, its not very expensive. You can just buy the individual cards you want on the community market and have a good deck for about $20. Alternatively you can play draft as much as you want for no extra charge.
Every match you play feels as intense as RTS ranked matches.
Now with the added progression and card balance in the table, the game will address every flaw it had and really stand out from competition.

Massive potential. And the price is actually way more cheap than other CCG's if you want to build tier 1 decks and be competitive.

Highly recommended, even if you don't have money to spend more than on the initial purchase, because you get a lot of free modes with progression (free Draft, my personal favorite).

Are you an Arena mode/Draft mode player? Then this is the best in the market.
Are you a constructed player? Then this game is not that expensive. You get competitive tier 1 decks ranging from $10 to $50.

This game will be the best on the market after one or two expansion sets. Plus it has Valve behind, and they often listen.
The latest update provides a way to earn cards for free, ranking, and ladder progression.

Best online card game I have ever played.  When you win, you feel like you have truly accomplished something.
I've played just about every card game and this is one of the greatest. There are a lot of critical decisions to be made so the game really rewards the better player. (Usually games with this much rng just turn out to be die rolls but I've been pleasantly surprised with how the rng is handled in this game) I've never felt that I lost a game to rng that couldn't have been won by me making better play decisions. 10/10 game. Would highly recommend, especially to competitive players.

P.s. anyone who says this game is pay to win is bad at this game.
Valve fixed nearly every problem today. Cards are getting balanced, there are free ways to earn tickets and packs, update cadence is insanely good. Core gameplay 100 out of 5 stars. Bright future for this game.
Artifact started with the wrong foot, but Valve gave proof of its willingness to listen to the community and make the game better. Things are definetely starting to look brighter! Good job!
I have played this game from release and I really liked it. It is a fun and addictive card game that is probably better thought of a board game with cards rather than just a board game
Many things have changed for the better from the launch. Draft and event modes are the best, constructed still needs you to have a deck that can cost any amount $30-$60 in the future, but its fine. At least it isn't pay2pay2win, card balancing was the best decision ever made.
Great game, but the experiment around the ecosystem failed.  Valve has listened to the community and totally overhauled their movel in less than a month from launch.  Other developers take note this is how to reengage your audiance from a bad start.  Artifact has a very bright future if these recent updates are anything to guage by.
Great game. Took me a while to understand the game but once you understand the basics its a really fun game to play. The new update has addressed some of the issues that were raised in the past so should be good incentive to start playing!
Really interesting card game, with a lot of interesting mechanics. My favorite part is the 3 lines system, it increases the complexity and the diversity of the game, so you get more different games and your skill shows more. I would recommend
Best card game on the market. You are not reliant on packs, just get the cards you need! Deep gameplay, well-designed ruleset. All-round amazing and there is more to come!

Valve has completely changed their mindset about the game. 

They will balance cards now which is great for everyone and give out free packs for those who prefer to spend time instead of money.

There is a progression system now, Color Blind Mode and so much more!
A great game, with a very high skill cap and very deep and entertaining gameplay. Not to mention the animations and voice work. Every single card has fully voiced lore, and most units have voice lines to interact with each other. The game was not without its share of problems, but Valve have shown that they care about the community's complaints and have fixed most, if not all, of the problems that people had. They completely changed their design philosophy when they realised that the pros were outweighed by the cons.
As a Dota 2 player and MtG veteran, I didn't play the game from the beginning in spite of I was really hyped for it - instead I was patiantly waiting while believing in long term success due to the fact that Valve is behind it. And todays patch brings me back!
Great gameplay and mechanics. Would DEFINITELY recommend.

Originally some questionable design decisions around paying to play expert and unwillingness to make balance changes (basically, made it too much like physical card games).

Latest update addressed all of this.
The release of this game was a real emotional rollercoaster.

Game itself is incredibly fun and challenging. Kudos to Valve for quickly responding to the negative feedback and addressing almost every single issue the community had. Here's to a bright future =).


Dota-level depth, in a Hearthstone or MtG-like package. Incredibly fun if you enjoy card games with a lot of decision making. 

Added reward systems on Dec 20th fix all the progression and card earning complaints. Even before those I hadn’t spent a dime past initial buy in, and have actually made over $60 on the market selling cards I acquired through play. 

Game is great. Complaints are unwarranted. 10/10 would make money on again.
Artifact is the best card game I've played by far. Updates have shown Valve is addressing some of the concerns in regards to the games cost and progression system, although the game still feels very overpriced for what it is.
Best card game I have ever played. Yes, it has it's issues but Valve is doing a great job on fixing those issues therefore I highly recommend this game if you are a card game fan.
One of the best card games i ever played!
People from heartstone will have a hard time though since this game is way more complex and hard to learn. But if you invest some time this card game is beyond good.

The last patch even included a progession system and up to 15 free packs + 15 tickets you can grind if you want to.
I was initially enjoying the style and gameplay Artifact brought to the table but was concerned over a lot of the things I was seeing in regards to buy to win, card balance, progression, lack of cards etc. In a span of 3 weeks Valve has addressed a vast swath of these problems and the health of the game is looking up with a very bright future. I think this game deserves a second look by the people who discarded it, it's actually pretty damn fun.
I enjoy playing this game. ATM I almost exclusively play the draft modes. I have played Hearthstone, Gwent, and MTGA in the past. If you like card games, you will probably like this game. I can't speak for the constructed experience but the drafting experience is one of the best I have played, even if you just want to play the free draft mode as opposed to the $1 ticket draft mode.
Valve are listening and making positive changes (addressing card balance, lack of progression, poor in-game communication functions). What was a fun game marred by a few broader issues, is now a fun game on the path to becoming a great one. 

For what it's worth, I do not play constructed at all - and I'm having a lot of fun with the other modes. Definitely worth a go!
-awesome visual design
-complex and satisfying gameplay
-in-client open tournaments
-progression
-marketplace
-Dota 2 lore
-snappy animations
-amazing voicelines
-chat

Whjile the list above is not a complete one it covers some of the things I like about the gamer. Artifact has a very solid basis to build on. With recent changes Valve showed that they are willing to listen to the community and make adjustments to the game. I fully expect this game to continue to grow in all aspects.
Just an amazing game. But what makes it even better is Valve's developers listening to the community and applying quick patches to make it even better. Kudos to the team!
I have waited to write this review. I wanted to see whether or not valve would actually believe in this game with it's heavily declining playerbase early on. However, in just over 3 weeks, they have managed to actually listen to their community (something valve isn't very good at doing) and have made this into the game it should've been at launch.

In comparison to Hearthstone and Magic (I have over 100 hours combined in them) this game far surpasses them in gameplay, monetization and attention to detail. I think like all valve products this game will thrive and will be in the top steam charts quite soon, and it being valve this game will recieve updates for years to come.

The launch was rough. It was more like an open-beta. But Valve updates the game weekly and the changes are in the right direction. (Progression, Balance, in-game rewards, PUBLIC TOURNAMENTS (THE BEST FEATURE!!!), etc...)

I have played Hearthstone, Fearia, Pokemon TCG and Elder Scroll Legends and I can comfortably say that this one is the most enjoyable one for me. Not too complex, nor not too easy. Not too quick, nor not too long match times. Decks don't decide a match's outcome from the start. A lot of strategy involved. There is RNG, but far less effective in this one. 

I firmly believe that the game will be even better as Valve showed with their initial 2 updates.
"In truth", Saint Professor Noxious once said, "Artifact had a disastrous release, but there is still a place, there are still people who are waiting for a cardgame that has the good parts of Artifact. You tell me that Artifact is dead, oh chat, but what it matters is how Valve'll decide to handle it."

And so Valve listened to his community, and so they patched, and they were so fast and precise and everyone rejoiced.
Valve released a patch today that removed all of my worries for the future of this game.

I really enjoyed my time with the game but I was worried that I would have no incentive to continue playing and was anxious about everyone quitting.

I'll update my review as I get better at the game, but now that Valve has shown they will have balance patches and XP progression to get packs and event tickets, I'm convinced people will stick with it and give it a chance to grow.
Very different take on the Card Game genre. Bit of a rocky launch, but they have pushed out a lot of updates so far that have been good, like balancing problem cards.

My current main issue with the game is that there doesn't seem to be any type of competitive ladder or ranking. They just added a "progression system" but it seems like you just gain ranks and can't lose them, which doesn't feel like a ladder. 

Nonetheless, good updates so far, hope to see them continue to buff/nerf cards when needed.
Best trading card game i ever played.

Skill has way more weight here than in other TCGs where it feels the deck plays itself. Choosing when and where to play each card based on the state of the board is crucial. You feel like you are always one wrong decision away from losing, so every match feels really intense.
The monotization is now the best of both worlds. You can buy for any card you want from the marketplace, usually for a very cheap price and you can grind for packs.

They also, fixed the lack of progression in the game and there are plenty of things.

Constructed is going to become playable finally, they have announced that they are going to be doing slight balanc changes here and there and imo have made the game healthier by making more cards viable.

Great game. What's around it is finally good too.
This recent update fixed many of the complaints I had about the game. Packs and tickets can now be earned, and the balancing changes this patch were fantastic and addressed many of the concerns the community had. Valve has been listening to what it's customers wanted, and overall I have loved my time playing this game so far.
Great game love the concept of the 3 lanes, makes slamming down creatures and spells more thoughtful because you have decide how to allocate your resources. The most recent update has finally added some progression and ranking feeling to the game, welcome change, keep it up Valve!
The mixed rating is a very fair assessment of the game.

On a mechanical level, Artifact is far better than any other online TCG I've played (Hearthstone, MtG, Gwent, etc).  The 3 lane system and mechanics for comeback potential and intellect to have more sway than RNG (mitigated by RNG occuring before the play and allowing the player to predict and react afterwards) is fantastic.

The game fails immensely on a social level however.  Various business decisions by Valve has made the game simply not fun.  It feel empty to play: text conversation is depressingly limited (compared to any other online game Valve has made), you can't draft directly with a friend, the player base is tiny due to the initial $20 buy-in cost (which from an objective view is a fair price given how the market works compared to Hearthstone but has lead to a tiny player base), and there is no ladder resulting very little incentive to become better unless you care about money and the competitive side of the game.  Due to the small playerbase, queue times for competitive modes is embarrassingly long.  It feels like Valve wanted this game to feel like a real-life TCG but forgot to adjust for the differences an online, PC game needs in order to actually be fun and cause players to want to come back to.

This is a wonderful game ruined by terrible business decisions and I hope Valve can manage to fix the problems soon.  Make the game feel more social and give it more meaning to want to keep playing because a tiny majority of the player base actually cares about making money off an online game. Then this game may still have hope.
I have played a few hours of Artifact. and I do like it. The economy seems to be a problem for most people, and that may be true. 
There are some elements however of which the rng (perhaps this is to my ignorance since It may be that I have not invested enough time in the game) can be a frustrating thing, deployment phase, arrow phase and so on. All though the rng is there to make the battlefield more dynamic and less stale, but I can't help to feel that I am just an observer trying to make the best out of a bad situation of the coinflip.

I am looking forward to see how this game will be developed, and in this writing moment I do have faith in that it will be a good game. I think patience here is really the key, and to look foward to see what this game can be, and not what it is as of right now.
I suck at MOBAs, but I love the concept. A turn-based MOBA cardgame is something I never knew I wanted. 

It's not without its problems, of course. This is effectively a paper TCG in digital forms - all cards come from packs, and you don't earn packs by playing. I totally understand why people are upset by this, especially when it's so easy to compare it to Hearthstone and its "free" to play model, but for $20 the pre-constructed decks have been a blast to play, and you get 10 packs. 

I don't know how deep I'll get into the deck construction, and I'm certainly not going to pay $10 for a single digital card, but most cards are in the $0.03-0.10 range, which isn't terrible. If I DO start playing constructed, I could feasibly fund my collection by selling Trading Cards earned playing other games. 

The actual gameplay is - again - fairly similar to Hearthstone mechanically, but combat being spread across three lanes makes for an interesting puzzle. Games last around 30-45 minutes, and it feels like 10.
V complex and thought provoking CG. Losses and wins feel like they are down to the decisions I made and not what cards i have or what hands i drew. If you like CG's and have $20 to spare I'd reccomend giving it a shot
This is the deepest and most rewarding card game ever created.  Given time this game will only get better.  Ignore the negative review bombs and give Artifact a shot.
Awesome game for those who like card games with a mix of: strategi, economy and positioning. 
Pros: complex, dynamic and fun
Cons: stepp learning curve. 

Still i would give the game a 9,5/10


Easily the most fun out of the multiple card games i've played for years. I understand peoples anger about having to spend money on constructed in a card game but at least you get quality gameplay, plus draft is free and fun. Also, the rng is not that bad, I have not lost a game yet just because someone has played cheeting death. I think iv only lost one lane to that card before. its not too hard to contest with, people just don't understand the importance of knowing how to deploy correctly and not overextend in a lane u would end up winning anyway (also cards like demagicking maul). Compared to Hearthstone (which everyone seems to love) this game is much more complex and enjoyable (imo) and the rng is fairly easily  factored into your turns. Iv made it through all three board wipes from blue and still won, I never felt like it was unfair because I had planned for wipes on turn 3 and was ready for it to happened. Haven't played much expert but iv had a few perfect runs in casual connstructed now. Overall, I easily would reccomend the game if u dont mind spending a few bucks to play constructed or if u want to play draft for free (which is what I thought when I boiught the game but constructed was too fun).
I came from playing hearthstone, and only heard about this game on the day it was released. The mechanics look like a lot when you first load into the game, but after a short period of playing against the bots its quite easy to pick up; but hard to master. 
The payment model of the game could be worked on slightly and currently there are some cards that you just 'need' to have a chance in constructed mode.
But draft is this game's strongest feature, giving you the ability to see all the cards for free and give you an idea of new decks are strategies you can bring into your own decks.
9/10
If you like a challenge this game is for you!
This game is a ton of fun. People hate on every game that comes out these days. Bought it on the launch day and have been having a great time. I've played MTG and Hearthstone a lot ands this blows Hearthstone out of the water. It is as fun as MTG. I have a hard time saying it is better than MTG but it's at least a thought. 


The game mechanics are awesome, its nice looking working smooth and got a deep game structure. But this pay system without any way of gettting decks without really money spent will be the end of this game. So I hope you can add some way to do it, sure I have no problem to open my wallet up. But the rest of the audience doesnt look that way.. it does exist to  big card games that offer this mechanic that will always be a couple of steps ahead of artifact unfortuneally.. ! So I hope you will fix this.. because I think if you dont you will lose all other gamers that doesnt have the money or want to give the money to play. <3
Update, Artifact has added a basic leveling system with rewards. You can now earn packs and individual cards for free. It's a shame they did not have this at launch. It may have saved a lot of the player base.

Artifact is a good game that is lacking some key features. The visuals are beautiful and the soundtrack is AMAZING. It is a very well put together game with unique, strategic gameplay. However, right now there is no progression system at all. Not even page where you can view your stats. It also lacks a realistic free to play model. You can not earn cards for free unless you can consistently win at least 67% of matches in draft mode. I do like that you can buy individual cards from the steam market instead of burning through packs looking for one card.

If you're on the fence about buying this game you can pay the $20 and only play "casual draft mode" which is free and offers no rewards. You will get a good feel for the game and learn how all the cards work. (This is all I have done for 36 hours playtime)

Good:
The game itself is beautiful
The soundtrack is AMAZING
Unique strategic gameplay
Individual cards on Steam Market

Bad:
No stats tracker (win/loss ratio, ect.)
No progression system (Fixed) 
No realistic F2P model (Slightly Fixed)
RNG can almost decide matches
Was having fun playing it for a couple hours Built a deck that was doing great against bots, and then decided to try Expert. and Immediately got Wrkt by someone of "My skill level". Can definately see its a Pay to win game. Maybe if I sell other stuff on the market that I get while playing other games, I'll continue, but until then I'm good.
Was already a great game in my opinion, but valve went out and responded to the main complaints by actually solving them. Most cards have been improved, we have chat, progression, and now you can earn card packs. I think the $20 was initially worth it, but now it is for sure worth the price tag.
Either be rich or play draft. Or maybe play vs AI
Edit: Now there's a way to get cards in game, Axe and Cheating Death got nerfed and there's a progression system. 8/10 still haven't nerfed drow ranger passive ability
Never played card game in my life, skipped all the iOS iterations and saw a video of this on Twitch and thought i'd give it a try. I gotta say, this has been absolutely a gateway drug into an entire other world. I've never even played Magic and thats been around since since I was a tween. I'm really enjoying this modern digital stratgy game that I usually only associated with deep board games. Kudos Valve! Keep the updates coming!
[h1]Controller support, Please![h1]
It would be great if you could support the controller, so I could sit on the couch and play Artifact, just like Gwent Cards, and that would be great!
I really, really want to be able to support controller.
EDIT: They listened to the people and added the features we were asking for, so I have changed my rating as promised and can now recommend this game! ITS FIXED!





I want to like this game and give it a great review except I cant do that until steam adds a way to earn completely free packs. I am not saying u should be able to get a ton of packs for free daily, but there should be an available grind to earn free packs like in hearthstone, I know steam commented on why they didnt do this but I disgaree with them and I think they will soon learn if they want this game to survive, creating a way to earn compeltely free packs (no tickets involved) is the only way they will keep this game going.  I will change this review to a thumbs up when they fix the game.
Quite a good game. Phantom Draft and Preconstructed are a blast without spending additional money. 

I think most of the people who are review bombing this have no concept of "time equals money."

You spend 20 hours a week to grind free cards in other games and you complain about a $1.99 booster pack. Is your time literally worthless?
I really enjoy Artifact. There is a ton of strategy in the game and it takes a lot of hours to start consistently winning games. Learning about the different strategies diversifies the game greatly. When they add a ranked mode it will be much better, but I'm being patient, the game just came out after all.
Game is complicated and challenging, that's great for me.
I have the impression that it's made for cardgame enthusiasts, so it's kind of a niche game. I think it's a great game for its target group, which isn't large masses.
The draft mode might become the main competitive format for this game. Because it's online, it's more feasible to spectate competitve draft tournaments than it would be in physical card games.
The constructed mode requires the cards to be bought from the Steam marketplace. Some people hate it, but I don't care as I only play drafts, both free mode and paid entry mode. 

I've played Gwent as well, and I like Artifact more. There's more options, more choices to make.

I believe the game got hurt by its launch hype and popularity, as many people bought it because it's Valve game without first looking at what it's like. 


Read the tl;dr for recommendation (its only recommended for a tiny niche of players)

Mechanically fantastic game, probably the best I've played since Dota 2. The dev team seem genuinely interested in developing it. Sadly it's ruined by a terrible business model. No way of earning cards out of Buying the game, tickets, packs tc.. Which is a bit much. So far, the community has declined fast particularly for a Valve game. It's down like 60-70% since peak at launch.

It's a complicated three lane/deck structure with 5 heroes like in Dota. You also have to manage numerous resources like in MOBAs like mana and abilities, items, and minions. It's incredibly unique, but also at times it feels you need to spend a lot of money one one or two decks to be competent. 

People saying it's dead, I'm not too sure. This is Valve, they could keep supporting it for as long as they wanted
Remember there is still:

1. A S1 million tournament early next year (like a Micro International)
2. iOS and Android ports
3. A lot more cards, content and gameplay features (Progression and Social features being added by year end).
4, Potentially a free-to-play model with some of the limited modes as a last resort (I think Gaben had a list of what game he should make f2p next after TF2 and Dota 2, and he ticked the CSGO box instead of this).

It's a very expensive buy-in for what it is. I don't think Valve realised this. Deck prices are not cheap (Axe, Drow etc..) and are really only worth investing in if there is a decent playerbase long-term which, lets be honest, is not incredibly likely if things dont improve. CSGO didn't start off amazing either but this game needs a lot of work.

Peak hours for this game are a little different to most of the top games. I think most players are Russia/China. Doesn't really affect me, but anyone west of EU central has a small playerbase.

In my opinion, what this game needs is:
1. A free-to-play mode or model that doesnt let you grind cards Just make the phantom draft mode free. pretty simple. Some of those users will buy in. I'd rather that than the game dying..
2. Mass promo once the Phone ports come out, and pump out streaming content for the tournament. Twitch coverage is dropping fast and interest is waning.
3. Some kind of earnable stuff, like gems or something you can earn tickets from. If Valve don't add value to the game the "mass audience" will leave.
4. Expand the scope of the game. It seriously needs workshop support, like card labels, changeable designs for tables new arts for heroes, flashy animiations etc. Bring over some of the Dota couriers instead of the imps (I just want cluckles) and another 6 months of updates to make it engaging.


tl;dr It's an incredibly niche card game that at the moment isn't worth the "Buy-in" for most people. I wanted something for work to play in quick sessions so I got it since I like Dota 2. It's not one of these digital card games that takes 100s of hours to grind for good cards (Hearthstone. Yugioh etc.) but also, it's not at the place where, for the average person its worth investing $30-$40+ for good cards. Which is the main selling point.

Either it will die a slow death, or magically improve somehow. With Valve products you never know what will happen.
Really fun game. The gameplay is deep and engaging. I find myself always thinking about my next moves during the opponent's turn and I never feel bored, a problem I have with other digital card games. Games are more often than not won with only one turn to spare for the winner. I always feel like I could have made a slightly different play and won.

It is also a beautiful game. Rivals and even surpasses Hearthstone (the obvious comparison) in terms of polish(TM). The animations, sounds, everything is just... wonderful.

The monetization is a hot button issue, and I think this game definitely has some stuff it needs to iron out before the dust settles around it. I do not personally think it's the worst thing ever, but it is no "better" than other greedy CCGs that exist. Valve really missed the mark there. If they make some changes making the barrier to entry a little less steep, I think a lot will be forgiven.

Overall if you like card games this is a must play.
I like it.  Fun game.  To me it's a cross between Magic and Hearthstone.  I do wish however there was a better tutorial.  There are still some things I am confused about and I am having a hard time finding answers to my questions.  I also wish there was a good in game tutorial on deck building.  I'm pretty sure I will get it after a while though.
I'm not the best player, and haven't played a ton, but I really do find this game fun and really engaging. Yes the economy is a little iffy but it's cheaper than physical card games. Despite the lack of progression and social features, I still find this more engaging than Hearthstone and MTG Arena. There's a lotta negativity in the forums and subreddit, and I get it, but I do have faith that Valve will update this and add features and fix things! It probably came out too early honestly, but I do think it'll be polished and all that. I wanna change the color of the imps though, please lol
This is the best CG on the planet! Every match is a real challange. Just perfect. I've played so many card games in my life but this is the new quality. Total cost of playable 2-color competitive deck is about 50$ (Artifact + important meta cards).

This game is so good!
Note: so far I have only played Casual, and Expert Phantom Draft modes. (23 hours played at time of review)

Positive: The game brings a fresh perspective to the CCG genre. The three lanes allow for tough decision making, and the initiative mechanic makes you really think about the order in which you play your cards. Matches turn out exciting and tight; really a game of inches.

Negative: Matches take long; games can take 20-30 minutes. That said I don't see an easy way to fix this. Also it lacks some quality of life features, which likely will be added soon - e.g. replay system, ranking, etc.

Neutral: The cost. It does not seem that high to me. I only payed the initial $20 and had a blast. I will probably pay for a few more event tickets in the future, to play Expert draft which is most fun for me. You can also just play Casual draft, or Call to Arms if you are out of tickets.
I am coming to the game as a long term card game player and from that perspective, there is lot to love about Artifact. The complexity and yet elegance of the game is amazing. Artifact is great in achieving what would be a pain to do on a regular board, takes care of all the upkeep, nicely signifies which units are going to die, which cards you can play etc. I also love the fact that just by seeing certain heroes, you know what you can expect from the decks, something that other CCGs are missing - so you are either following the meta or you are completely blind to what your opponent can play. So it gives each hero a specific flair, some personal touch. 

Yes, the matches are longer than usual for other online card games. Yes, the game is certainly quite complex and not as straightforward as other CCGs, especially as heroes dying is involved. It is necessary to remind yourself that your goal is not to destroy enemy's heroes (as it allows them to redeploy). The strategy is is all about pacing, deciding on which towers to focus and how to misdirect and bluff your opponent into committing to unimportant lanes. Personally, I like the randomness of creep deployment and attack direction, but I understand it can be frustrating for some people to lose because of it. 

I also love the business model and I was excited for it from the entire beginning. I don't think giving cards away for casual play is necessary and would destroy the economy. I enjoy the fact I can buy decks for money directly, much more than I like getting "free" random packs in other games. I have bought few "preconstructed" decks for about 3 eur and enjoy my time with them. I love the fact I can go online, create/find a deck I think I'll enjoy and then just buy it. Sites like ArtifactFire allow you to even sort them by current market value and so you can search for interesting decks for 2-3 bucks and play with friends. Sure, you are probably not going to win a tournament, but I am in CCGs more for fun than domination :) Also, other CCGs force you to buy packs after packs and without any serious hope of getting what you need or what you like. Getting that winning deck for tournaments is therefore much more costly. Artifact tournament level decks atm. might cost 20-40 bucks, but you know what you are getting. You give cut to Valve for sure, but the main part of that money goes back to players. 

So I enjoy the game, but so far, there is also a lot to desire - replays of past games, some sort of progression (say with cosmetics, emotes) and achievements would be nice, some daily challenges etc. But I believe that Valve is listening and is working on it and I hope that Artifact will evolve and just be more what the players want. And as far as the business model goes, I believe that people will eventually understand its merits over purely random card distribution.
I played a 40 min long game with a "Blue/Green" deck vs a full black one. The last 20 mins of the game was an absolute edge of your seat back and forth and crazy strategy and gambles, trying to shuffle resources from one lane to another, with both of us down to ancients and marginal things saving us multiple turns in a row from death.

If i had to play a 40 min game in Hearthstone i wouldve been diagnosed with terminal cancer already.

In all seriousness there can be very unfortunate situations and depressing games in here too, and some of the mechanics arent that refined, but the game has much more play and interaction and subtle ways u can improve your play game to game. Terrific card game thats actually fun to play even for extended period, rather than the short bursts that u can tolerate HS in.

Game rquires money more or less. You can earn pack but only by investing already. If u buy cards with money though, the game is much more predicatable and cheaper to make decks. 

You can endlessly play the casual draft mode if that alone is enough for ya, its pretty fun, some people prefer it constructed altogether.

Game needs to fully find its legs but the engine is really good and its pretty promising for a starter pack.
They have been listening to the community with the updates. And that's great.
Draft mode is where this game shines, so you can sell all your cards unless you want to play Constructed, which is good enough.
It still feels bad to play Prize mode unless you can get consistent prizes. Social tournaments are great but you have to find them on dedicated Discords
Played a lot of card games, and the mechanics of this are easily the best. So much fun with many decisions, every game feels winnable and are more often than not very close matches.
Enjoyable gameplay. Breath of fresh air from other digital card games. The three-lane mechanic is great.

But beware: to acquire new cards, you have to spend money. You can buy random packs of cards, or purchase individual cards at market prices (though you can sell cards too -- it's all built into the client).
So, let me get this out of the way. Artifact is great. I love everything about this game so far. The fact that you can buy singles of the market place sold this game instantly for me. While there are slight rng elements in the form a placement of creeps, I feel this game is pretty skill based and does take time to master.

I feel the biggest problem artifact is going to have is trying to appeal to their target player base. They are an online card game built with an economy like a paper ccg. Most paper ccg players arnt going to stick to this because they would rather play magic irl, but that's not the audience they are going for anyway. With all logic, they are trying to obtain hearthstone players to come play this game.
Like I said above though, this is an online tcg built with a paper ccg economy. So the progression systems people are used to from online tcgs can't exist. It would make the economy of the game unstable and unviable. Which is also going to make it look much more like a money grab.
At its base though, all card are money grabs. The fact that this one let's you buy singles though, is much less of an investment than games like hearthstone. Rather than opening hundreds of dollars in packs, you buy 20 dollars in singles and finish your deck.
The problem with this though, while I prefer it, it does not give people the satisfaction of opening packs and feeling as though they are progressing themselves. With any online game, the feeling of progression is going to keep it alive with the more casual side of the playet base. Casuals keep games alive. You have to keep them happy to keep the economy of the game happy.

But also understand that, outside of the economy, you can draft for free infinitely in this game for fun. You can get hours of playing out of this game for free. Constructed is barely half of this game, and buying singles for constructed in this game is nothing compared to any other tcg out there. It Is so much cheaper.

I'd say give this game a try.
Having played Artifact, Gwent, and Hearthstone, I believe Artifact is a great digital trading card game. 

Games lasts about 20 minutes and 10 rounds. Each game is 1v1 and there is constructed mode and draft mode (akin to Hearthstone Arena).

It is quite challenging and having a good deck is only part of a successful match. There are lanes, heroes, towers, creeps, and many other things that will make it feel like DOTA and a MOBA. It is a significantly more complicated than Hearthstone and is similar to Gwent in skill cap. Cards are actually more affordable than Hearthstone, but if you are trying to go 100% free to play it would be very difficult. Cards you receive and don't want to use or already own can be sold on the steam marketplace to the highest bidder. Original set of packs I opened was worth over $20.

I'm looking forward to seeing more events and a ranked ladder. I do hope Valve adds a little bit of free to play elements, such as 1 quest per week for a free pack/event ticket.
Ive never played a card game before. With that said ive had a blast with this game and ive only spent a total of $40. 
Now lets get one thing straight. If you dont like the idea of a game where you cannot earn packs and cards for free then the game simply isnt for you. Doesnt make it a "BAD" game. The game, IMO is good like i said ive had fun 43 hours.

if you do like the game and dont mind spending the $20 to do just phantom draft or maybe you want to spend some more on cards. good, heres an analogy. a lot of you complaining are 100% okay with spending $10 or more on a movie ticket, possible popcorn and a drink, for maybe $10 or $15 more. either way you can justify spending that money to go to a movie for a grand total of around say 2 hours. (Which can be rented or bought cheaper on release since we care about money so much right?)But, you cant justify spending $20 on this game, and playing a minimum of 4 hours to play? and have joy with it? 



Artifact is a paradox, on one hand it has a deep complexity but on the other is easy to learn. The game really takes you by the hand from min 1. I can see a few things that could be improved, but so far I must say I'm deeply impressed by the quality of the game and the fun it procures. Combos and finish are usually awesome and full of surprise. Great job Valve you did it again.

Note about monetization: I think the balance is fine in Artifact. Some game mode even use free pre-made decks. There is no grind, those who are the best will surely find it's easy to get new cards as the game rewards them - but ultimately and like a real *trading* card game the easiest way will always be to buy packs or cards from the market.
Gameplay is really fun. And the game is very cheap if you play it casual and don't play constructed or only with commons/uncommons.
I sold my rares and basicly paid 10$ for the game.

Still missing a lot of features though, hopefully valve is working on that.
Actually enjoying it more now I put some time into it. But. still a piss take i couldnt refund just because I opened the packs the game shoves in your face.
Game is great fun, got a learning curve but feels really tactical.

And as a casual that doens't like the card grind, I love the fact I can get budget decks for a couple of dollars and competive decks go for 40 dollar on the market and costing less by the day.

Way more fair system then the RnD card packs, recommended!
Valve has announced balance changes, including a nerf to Drow Ranger and Axe.

My negative review related to a lack of balance changes. For now, this is a step in the right direction and the game appears to be back on track.
The Gameplay is great. The 3 lines bring more depth and strategies to the Game and i really like that concept.

I have no problem with the fact you can not earn cards by playing the game, but just with real cash, everyone will have to pay for the cards which gives them a different value. 

A great plus is the marketplace where you can sell and buy cards for real money, i missed that in other games.

All in all, well done, great game.
Lack of tutorials. Need added vital systems, like: chat, matchmaking rank... Give it a try if you are die-hard fan of DOTA 2 or trading card games. Peace!
I felt compelled to write a review. I am not a card game person but I do have about 2800 hours in DotA 2.

All of the cards have a little 3 paragraph description of some lore surrounding the card. I'm a fan of the comics from DotA 2 and the lore in general which was neat. 

The game has been easy to pick up but I can see how a high level game could go down.

The effects when cards are being played have familiar sounds and illustrations. Which has helped me get into this genre.

I haven't played competitively but I could see myself wanting to gamble because the game is in fact fun. 

As everyone else has said, you can sell your cards and just play casual and you can still have a good time. 


I love the game and its mechanics. The cards manage to capture the feeling of a normal dota game but in card form.
In my opinion it is also good that you can always play the draft mode with all the cards in the game with no addtional cost.

The main defect for now it is that you cannot communicate with your opponent in any way at the moment. Even a simple Chat wheel would be very welcome.
Need task system to keep people motivated!! It feels like single player game!!!
And please add some dynamic figures on the background, even at the main menu. I see the potential. For example, you can click in the house and so on
Even though the constructed mode is terrible, draft more than makes up for it. Gameplay is solid, easily the best out of all the digital card games. Other than buying the game you don't need to pay anything to play competitively, futhermore you can easily make your money back or even profit by selling cards on the market, so you can't go wrong by buying this game. It's only going to keep getting better as they introduce more promised features (most if which were available in beta and should have been available on launch but for some reason they were not?) such as ladder, social, player profiles, etc.
I can't believe how negatively this game is getting reviewed. I've been using Steam for over a decade and have never felt compelled to write a game review until today.

TL;DR: Don't hate the game, hate the genre.

Games I'm familiar with: physical MTG, MTGO, most MTG versions released through Xbox 360 Arcade, MTGArena, Hearthstone... the gold standards. I've played both MTG and Hearthstone for 100s if not 1000s of hours in my life, and quite frankly I don't have time to dabble with all of the competitors.

Here are the top 3 things that are not articulated by most reviews:

[list] [*]$20 gets you 10 packs that cost over $2/each after tax is calculated so you are getting the base game for free based on what you receive initially. On top of that, you get 2 prebuilt decks that contain cards from the first set as well as the base set. The entire contents of the base set is 7 total cards (4 heroes and 3 items) so most of the 2 decks you receive for free are cards from the first set. Lastly, you receivet 5 event tickets that cost $5 + tax if you buy them later. So in buying the base game you get over $25 of value + a bunch of cards from the set. If you don't want to pay $20 for over $25 worth of game value to get into a TCG/CCG (no actual trading yet), move on and don't buy.
[*] On top of the starting cards you get for free, you can draft decks and play them for FREE. Anyone familiar with the games I listed above knows how ridiculous that statement is.
[*] The game itself is deep and immersive. The back and forth alternating gameplay in each lane prior to combat feels very much like a tabletop game and works really, really well. There is a lot of inherent strategy and counterplay. The matches really seem very competitive and close, with the vast majority of my losing matches feeling winnable if I had played my cards differently. Some rares are very strong. Most are situational and add more flavor than base strength to your deck. It's unfortunate that some critical traditional board clear cards are not more common. Cards of that nature don't tend to be common in TCG/CCG games. Artifact designers had an opportunity to change that but didn't. If they had it really would have allowed for more economical deck builds. I don't blame them, they have no incentive to change the model. [/list]

Sure there are some QOL improvements that I'd like to see. I fully expect Valve to make them over time. The game is barely a week old. The gameplay alone makes this an incredibly fun experience with a bit of a new take on the genre.



This is a fantastic strategy game. As far as card games go, this has one of the best economies I've seen. In hearthstone and mtg you have to spend hundreds of dollars just to build a tier one deck. In Artifact you can spend a little over a hundred to get full copies of every card.  There are some balance issues, but altogether this game is a lot of fun.
Best digital card game out there period.  There is a lot of depth here, but once you get into the swing of the game it becomes second nature.  There is lots of room to grow for new mechanics which bodes well for future expansions.  

Fears about the monetization have turned out to be unfounded.  In practice this game is much cheaper than HS or other F2P games because you can acquire just what you want rather than having to gamble.  Having a card game that isn't asking me to grind quests for meager rewards is quite refreshing.

The biggest flaw is the lack of gameplay rewards.  Cardbacks, animated cards, and new boards would really make this game more fun.
Free draft and a very compelling gameplay (once you get the hang of it) makes this a very fun and affordable game. If you'd rather play constructed check out the game market card prices, you can build a good deck without having to spend a lot of money in shitty rngboxes like other card games.
Rough around the edges but not a total train wreck. Buy now, learn the mechanics. Valve will not let this game die. It will only get better from here.

As a casual player who's never played a proper card game before I love this!

I've lost more games than I've won but the free casual play modes are what I'm playing. I've ignored all the 'Expert' play options so far.
The gameplay is fantastic! 

I just wish there were more play options. I am fine with no MMR, but it would be fun to be able to list tournaments publically and people can join even if they aren't on your friendns list. I only have 5 steam frieds, so relying on that to carry the mathmaking of the game does not work for people like me.
Game is great. If you are lucky enough you get good heroes in starter packs and from pre constructed decks. But if you are not, you have to spend a fair amount to win and rng is fair enough that if you play well you wont be punished.
nice card game 

i bought it because i got tricked by other reviewers here saying they made triple their money opening the packs that come with the game. i opened all my packs and dindt even get a single Axe. I think all my cards in total were worth about $5. I spent another $100 on buying cards from steam market to make two competitive decks to play
Fun and complex TCG. 

Still worth buying even if you dislike the economic model. Sell the cards you get from the first few packs and enjoy the free modes.
I intitially wrote a review giving it a bad score. As time has gone on i've come to appreciate the game. If you want a very competitive experience, this is the absolute best card game ever made. If you want a casual experience, this might not be a great game for you, but you should still give it a try. This game is basically like card-chess. The draft mode is infintely skillful. 
And the constructed mode is still better than hearthstone. 

They've truly shown they're willing to listen to the community and care about the future of this game.
Best computerized card game ever made, although its currently being aggressively boycotted by entitled Hearthstone players who apparently can only have fun with a game if they are making their Internet numbers get bigger
Better headline: TCG hits Steam and players are shocked to learn it's a TCG.  

You can't compare this to Hearthstone, closest things on digital market is HEX:TCG.   

Please learn the different between TCG and CCG before crying over the monitization.


great game, highly competitive, the only game that gave me a similar feeling is SC2 or Broodwar, is verry deep and difficult, can't wait for more content.

PS: just selling cards I don't use i've been playing constructed non stop and having a lot of fun, probably when I get better I'm going to put some money for more cards
Avoid the poor reviews which do not review the game

This is not a review, but more of my quick scattered opinions of the game.

The gameplay is some of the most rewarding and exhillarating which I have experienced in a typically traditionally slower paced genre of games.  

The foundation of this game surpasses any other card game I have played, a systematic approach is required to succeed in this game, and your ability to adapt to situations creates an enviornment which you don't experience often in cardgames

The visuals are beautiful

All cards are voiced and have interactions with other cards when played together

Draft is fun, feels like a true deckbuilder, and committing to deck with ability to make adjustments inbetween games is fun

Constructed could use a ranked system but thats in the process so review on that is pending, still have had fun creates my own decks and testing them out with new cards I get.

Many features I have not tried out seem compelling such as the user created tournaments 

Buy this game :D
since i love strategy games.. this game got everything i wanted to.
man.. winning a close phantom draft feels like winning against mega creep on dota.

Discussion about the cost of this game and it's cards asside, the gameplay is REALLY fun and If you don't want to spend £££ on cards, there is a free mode you can play.
There's a ton of hate on this game for its "terrible" monetization model. I think that's crazy. It's got probably the best monetization model in the online market, IMO. You can buy the vast majority of cards for well under $0.50, usually under a dime. 

But that shouldn't matter anyway. You can play so much of this game for free via Phantom Draft or Call to Arms, and it's insanely fun! Sure, some RNG elements need some nerfs and other cards can use buffs, but it's a fresh game that is, at its core, really really fun. If you're on the fence but enjoy Hearthstone or Magic: The Gathering, give Artifact a try. You'll love it.
What a great game. Complex. Love the graphics.
I really hope to see some ranking system for constructed, like Hearthstone. After i exhauseted my event tickets I got borred. 
Add ranking system, Otherwise people lose incentive to play the game.
I cannot stress out enough how important is a ranking system. 
ADD RANKING SYSTEM.

I think it's pretty fun; being somebody who has played Hearthstone, Duelyst, MtG, YGO, and even Pokemon and Digimon way way back when.  Feels kinda like Magic and Hearthstone, but with some moba mechanics slightly altered to work in a TCG.
I find most complaints to be about purchasing new card packs; but like...isn't that the same in every single TCG ever?  I only remember ever getting cards without paying irl if they were gifts or prizes for winning a match.  If you really like card games, I'd say to grab it and maybe you'll find yourself getting a little invested into Artifact.

If Valve adds 3v3s, trading, and holographics/reskins of cards then this is gonna be my personal favorite card game.

The random elements during a match can be frustrating, but card games in general deal with chance a fair bit.
Casual Phantom Draft is free and unlimited; reviews about a lack of gameplay/paywall; I would consider false.

Watch out for Axe too lmao
A good game with big flaws such as :
- Economic system feels really daunting and frightening
- Games are super long and can be flipped over at the very end
- A bit too much randomness on minions spawn.

It can become a 10/10 with some work but is actually a 6/10.

EDIT :

Actually Valve is changing a lot this game and overall I think it will be less expensive that F2P such as Hearthstone, if you account for the owning of cards. I selectively bought some low-tier but still useful cards and overall you can get 90% of the game for quite a low price... so not that bad!
A. Good mechanics very good game but outside the actual game it needs work.
B. After paying the 20$ (i recieved the product free from someone) u need to give money to either buy cards directly or from packs or pay for tickets to play modes where u earn packs if u get good. with purchase of game u get 10 packs and 5 tickets.
C. There is no progression like a ladder or something like that to see who is better than who.
D. There are 2 formats 
1. where u collect cards and make decks out of them but since u only get 10 packs at start if u dont get very lucky u cant make good decks without spending more money. even if u make a good deck u will get bored eventually and will try to make new decks but u cant because u will need more cards. this mode has free and ticket version where u get packs for winning.
2. where u make decks (again and again but u dont get to keep the cards) out of 5 packs and play from them which is what i am mostly playing ( there is a free version where u dont get anything to win) in the ticket version 1$ per ticket if u win u get packs.
E. Its lore and voice acting is top notch if u play dota 2 u will enjoy this very much which i do. every card has lore and voice acting done on them. They have even released 2 comics setting up the events for the first set of cards released with the game again if u like a little story even in multiplayer games u will like this game.
F. It has many things missing from game which are staple in card games like action tracker.
G. Needs optimization makes my laptop hot even though my laptop doesnt get hot easily playing high graphical games like witcher 3.

Conclusion
Dont think of this game as 20$ ya it costs 20$ but to fuly enjoy this game u need to atleast put 50$ dollars more in it so u can  basically think of this game as somewhere from 60$ to 300$ (u can buy all cards outright from steam maket if u want) so if u dont have this kind to money dont buy. its mechanics are very good better than hearthstone in my opinion. for now i am giving it a 6/10. 

Exception- if u have played card based games like hearthstone or Magic the gathring and were good in them u can probably collect every card under 50$ dollars becasue tickets get refunded if win enough so u can play paid version unlimited if u win enough.
While I'm uncertainty which path the competitive mode is going I must admit the core of the game which is gameplay is dope. There is still some work to do but the game definitely have great potential. For example I feel like there is a need to develop torunament mode to compesate lack of ladder mode. Anyway If you can accept economy very different from other digital card games Artifact should be on your wishlist,
Before I purchased the game, I was a little concerned about the pricing model that everyone is complaining about. But even as someone who abhors paying out the nose for CCGs (I banned myself from Hearthstone years back for dropping 80 bones in a week out of pure compulsion) I find Artifact's cost to be totally refreshing. I bought a reasonably competitive and fun deck for like, 5 dollars, and I've been having a blast. If you wanted to get really serious, you could buy one of the most-played decks in the scene right now for less than 40, which would bring your total up to ~$60, which is the same price as a AAA release — except if you're into this one, you'll definitely get much more play out of it.

The complexity of the game is much more interesting to me than its competitors (especially Hearthstone), and while there are a few drawbacks (a few too many cards that incorporate randomness, not quite enough synchronization), it's an extremely deep and compelling experience. And even if you don't want to pay an extra cent, you can play the phantom draft endlessly, which is an absolute blast. Highly recommend this to anyone even a little curious about it, especially folks that are used to games with an overwhelming learning curve at the beginning like, ahem, DOTA. Push through it and you'll find the fun in no time.
The least expensive TCG I've ever played very easy to go infinite the game has incredible depth and strategy after being worried about their monetary model before launch I'm very impressed and hope after the decline in players from the negative outcry about having to spend money in a TCG this game can continue to grow and evolve because it's a lot of fun.

- Gust
- No progression
Awesome game. Very creative to attempt to recreate the feel of a 3 lane MOBA into a card game. A lot of strategy with laning and decisions of resource investment into each lane. Really enjoying it thus far
While i do agree to that the way monetization was implemented could have been way better, effectivly there is no casual everyday casual games to play for a chance to a deck or ticket.

Overall the game and how you play is amazing, i love the gameplay, the way the game forces you to think and the attention to details put into it. I mainly play phantom draft which i find way more fun than constructed, but that might be reversed for some. Luckily there is a chance to play both in casual and expert mode where you wager a ticket or more.

I think this game might not be for everyone, but i love it!
the objective of every game developer is to have lots of people playing the game right?

valve already imposed a 20$ entry fee (vs f2p hearthstone and mtga), and then it decides to impose payments just for players to improve their decks, collect cards, and play games that provide for rewards.

every decision of valve is opposite to the objective - valve is actually severely limiting player base.

sad because artifact is a really nice and beautiful game.

so much effort from game developer may go to waste if there are not enough playing the game....
A very fun, very fresh take on TCGs.  Multiple lanes help stop one card from being absolutely overpowering. The stratedy of knowing when to push and when to abandon a lane is huge part of playing successfully. Feinting and counter-feinting is a challenge of its own. In fact, the whole game is overwhelming (in a good way) for the first few hours of play. Managing heros, items, mana, lanes and initiative is a lot to deal with!

I also appreciate that there are no pointless XP bars to fill or basic cards to unlock. I think the economy is very fair (although you will have to spend more than $20 unless you have insane luck in your first ten packs).
I am glad Artifact is focusing on the game and not the bulls*it around like daily quests, xp-bars and so on. After a long time this is the first game I play because I want to play the game itself and not because of rewards. I hope Valve don't add the things some people are screaming for. If you are bored by playing a game without leveling a comic-avatar just don't play Artifact and move to one of the thousands of others games. I like nothing happens if the round is over. 

And if you don't want to sell, buy or trade your cards - don't play a TCG. 

I like Artifact as it is right know and I really hope Valve will not leave the path they are on with it.
Review Edit:

Now that Valve introduced some semblance of free "progression", I'm going to change my review as promised.

Everything I've said below complimenting the mechanics is still true. Without crunching out a true composite score, I'd easily say this game is a/an B+/A- overall. There are a few heroes/champions that are much, much stronger than others, and a few regular cards that are too powerful as well, but not really anything game-breaking.

In terms of gameplay itself, my biggest complaint is pacing. Turn-timers work great in games like Hearthstone where your attention is wholly focused on the board in front of you. Multiply that by 3 and you have Artifact. Slow internet, not paying attention, actually needing to concentrate- whatever the case, a "round" (going through all 3 lanes) of Artifact takes way longer than it should, or at least it feels like it does. Maybe the turn-timers need to be adjusted to apply a bit more pressure than they do now? All in all, it's a minor complaint.

That being said, I'd like to talk about the progression system. Valve has now added a leveling system, as well as weekly bonuses. The leveling system will give you a few packs and event tickets, as well as avatars, at a gruelingly slow pace. The weekly bonus rewards you for your first 3 wins (in any mode, I believe- did not check Bots), and resets a week after your first win. While both of these do not allow for "rapid" progression, they are obviously better than nothing, and not too far off from existing games' models. Maybe with a bit more tweaking, some people will feel compelled to come back and try a game that I genuinely do find fun.

Old Review:

This game has some seriously solid mechanics that anyone who enjoys CCGs would find appealing. Each turn is dynamic and requires you to think 3 steps ahead, ensuring that all of your lanes are balanced and defended, or determining whether it's better to slog it out for 2 towers or slam a single lane twice. The draft mode is exciting while also providing a safety net of being able to take "extra" cards (more than the standard deck size norm) to play around with, unlike in games like Hearthstone.

Ultimately, this game will not survive if it continues with its current market structure. It is inconceivable that I not only have to pay $20 just to get the game, but that there also is no "free" way to grind out cards...you can't have it both ways. Hearthstone isn't perfect, but with enough time and skill, you can definitely acquire a meta-deck. With Artifact, you have the packs that you received at the start.

Your options to gain more cards are to spend 1 of the 5 free event tickets (given to you at the start) on competitive constructed or draft play. If you're like me and got absolutely terrible cards at the start, the option of comp. constructed play needs to be tabled until you get more cards. That leaves comp. draft, which is essentially a gamble. I've probably done about 12 casual drafts and won only 1 (admittedly, the first half or so of my games were me getting the hang of drafting and playing effectively). Instead of a simple majority wins, you need to win 5 games without losing more than once (2 losses is out), which is another challenge in-of-itself. The other half of my casual draft games were 3/4 wins and out, which did not feel good. For comp., you do receive a "refund" of a ticket after playing 3 games, but no real reward unless it's 4 wins. Given that you only have 5 free event tickets, I can absolutely see people only successfully completing 1 of the 5 comp. gauntlets (term for an entire set of draft games). Hopefully the reward is enough to bolster a not great deck to take into comp. constructed?

Surprisingly scummy behavior from Valve. Until the marketplace issue is resolved, I cannot recommend this game. Sure, you can have "endless" enjoyment in casual draft mode (constructed as well, if your deck isn't bad), but even those will get stale without additional cards for you to toy around with and keep. It's really a shame that such a brilliant game is ruined...well, maybe not ruined...but certainly marred by greed.

(And yes, I need to git gud and also realize that MTG has a similar cost overall. That doesn't give Artifact a pass.)
Game  looks and feels really good, can play all the cards casually  without buying new cards, which I like a lot since i dont want to grind for new cards/packs as i hardly play the game more than 4 hours a week.  
 
Opened the first 10 packs and got 12 bucks back and one month dota plus so am happy with paying 5 bucks for a well polished game which doesnt crash like other 60 bucks AAA games. 

Games lacks progression  even for casual players, but am sure they will add it in future updates as its not like there will be Artifact 2 next year and they will abandon this game or something . 


+ Really cheap card game compared to MTGO ( lol ) ,MGTA and Hearthstone. The top decks in this game only cost a maximum of around 50 GBP which is the price of an expansion pack of 50 packs in hearthstone which doesn't gurantee you any decks and also the cards lose value when disenchanted, while the Artifact cards , while not keeping their full value , will be able to be sold for a small loss. 

+ The game is very skill based and comebacks are very common and easy if played right, even if blue heroes might get stomped early by bristle, tresdin and axe, late game cards such as bolt of damocles and conflagrate and a lot of AoE board clears will help blue late game. The three lane system and all of the other game systems such as colours, items, improvements, the certain affixes such as Siege, Retaliate, Gold, Armour add up and work greatly together.

+ Great variety of decks for the beginning, with every colour having a viable competitive deck and also every deck having different strategies ( black = gondar track and jinada early into payday horn of alpha , green = mist of avernus + drow passive + cheating death + lycan for a lot of buffs and strong support, red = good stats, focused on out-trading and overpowering the enemy, though can fall off in late game if you don't get to Time of Triump , blue = focused on AoE and spells , starting off slow in the early game but becoming very strong  late game, a "control" deck)

+ The in-game tournament system , the over-all look and flow of the UI and menu's alongside with great acting and animations and the overall look and feel of the game is outstanding.

- Not global chat / in-game tournament FINDER and lack of Valve in-game amateur tournaments

- No progression system ( not necessarily gaining cards, mostly a Level and a Stats page and certaing prestige awards would be nice , like getting 10 perfect wins might get you an emblem or something to show that etc. )

- More game-modes should be added and a RANKED game-mode for both draft and constructed with no ticket requirements and with an MMR system , which could have the same ranks as in DotA 2, and also seasons such as in hearthstone, where you get rewards based on your rank in the previous season and also a reset of MMR / Calibration to climb all over again.

Overall , a great game with greate monetisation and very good gameplay. Missing ranked modes , progression system, and social aspects, which i am sure Valve is working on, apart from this the game is very good and I recommend picking it up if you are a TCG fan , a DotA fan, a valve fan or if you're curious about the game in general, you can alwasy refund the game withing 2 hours!!!
A very well designed digital TCG with incredible depth, dynamic matches and very well implemented draft modes. For the entry price you get as many packs as that would buy you (10), as well as 5 free tickets for competitive play, and access to events and casual game modes to the end of time (well, until the servers shut down). This includes a fully fledged draft mode, the best in any card game as far as I'm concerned. If that's your deal, you can also sell the cards from your packs to get back most of the money spent and basically enjoy amazing drafting TCG gameplay for free.

If you favor constructed play, the cards in those packs are likely to get you some foundation for budget decks and by trading cards you should be able to construct a pretty good meta deck below the price of a AAA game, which I think is fine pricing. I think with a few more sets the balance and viable deck types will even out a bit, currently mono color is simply not viable and the meta is pretty straight forward (early board presence of red is consistently powerful, combo decks to counter that are less reliable as a result of few cards to play with). Over time the marketplace is bound to be more favorable to those willing to spend the time and effort to read the meta and all that, so that's another bonus to waiting.

Basically, if you want to do drafts and events, it's a great value proposition and game. If you just want to grind constructed and tournies, realize it's still a TCG and won't be entirely cheap, and even then it may be better to wait for the marketplace and meta to evolve a bit further and possibly for the next set to release.
A beautifully presented and engaging TCG/board-game hybrid, that while incredibly frustrating at times, is still thoroughly enjoyable and should keep you coming back for more.

When you buy Artifact you get 2 "starter" decks and 10 boosters of 12 cards each.  Once you claim these after a brief tutorial, Artifact is non-refundable.

What I liked.

*Artifact is beautifully presented and engaging, with fantastic visuals, little touches like soundbytes from your heroes as you play cards, and the red and blue "imps" that give running commentary in mime.
*While a little frustrating at first; and even when you get the hang of it; the mechanics and playing across three boards (lanes) are fantastic and well thought through.  You do need to consider what you need to do on the current board, but also the other boards.
*Artifact can be incredibly rewarding as a game, but I am saying that as a casual player. 
*The pricing model is  very fair.  One booster (12 cards - 1 rare, 3 uncommon, and 8 commons, with a 5% chance for commons and uncommons to be upgraded) for 2USD is pretty good value for a TCG.  Then factor in the fact that you can buy cards for as little as five to ten cents (including some heroes), and most of the rares for under one dollar on the Steam Market, this game is a winner on that front.

What I didn't like.

*I found Artifact incredibly frustrating at first, in fact, I regretted my purchase initially.  Now that I've gotten the hang of it (relatively), I do enjoy it.  That being said, some games do feel incredibly one-sided, but that is part of TCGs, but Artifact in particular due tosome of the "randomness" of the game (I can't describe it better than that). 
*I do have some issue with some of the balancing of some of the cards, some of the red heroes in particular, especially in the early game.  But, it does even out later in game - just like how DOTA2 actually plays.
*I do feel that there is too much focus on rare cards and the developing metagame.  For me, it discourages deckbuilding and experimentation.  Keep in mind, that I say this as a casual player and I do understand that there is a BIG difference between casual play and competitive play.

What I would like to see happen.

*I guess for me a greater focus on casual play needs to be implemented or considered.  Provide an environment for competitive players to dominate each other, and they'll take care of the rest.  I really would like to see a greater focus on casual play that encourages deckbuilding and just having fun.  Possibilities include mini-tournaments for casual players with certain restrictions on the deckbuild.
*The other thing I would also like to see is a greater focus on developing the community and the hobby aspect of Artifact.  

So all-in-all, I really think that Valve are onto a winner here.  That being said Artifact will hopefully continue to develop and mature as a game, but will appeal to a large array of players both casual and competitive alike.
This is the game of minds, complex , intresting, everything a card game should be, a lot of negative reviews are about monetization, well mtg wasnt free too. Maybe valve will do something with it, but im fine with this model

Game is A nice Game. But you would better know that the fking details of game mechanics is really really dumb besides its well-known "money consuming". For instance, you can not pick a target for each minion without specific cards. Your three units including a thunderhide alpha who forgo a low hp tower and turn to target one 1 hp enemy when you are approaching success. You will know what i am saying. So so mad ;P. Good luck, summoners. Stupid game but i have to keep playing. Shame! Anyway, I recommend this game coz i was a dota player.
Worth the money i payed
Just play with friends in tournaments wherre u can enjoy all the cards free like palying card game in real life, while in real life u cannot play all the cards for free
Really happy

Really lovely, I gave up on MTG years ago, this feels like Magic 2.0.  Yes the pricing structure is rough for a video game, but its very friendly for a CCG.  I would love to see better rewards in Expert Queue, but other than that and wanting a bigger card base I'm very happy
Impression so far, I like this game, I really like this game

Pay to win, I don't really care but I would have liked it to be a free game

PROS
~ Even though the game is pay to win in constructed, you still need to be competent to win
~ gameplay is strategic and moves at a reasonable pace
~ I haven't seen any over the top combos. Yet.
~ Drafting, the best mode in any TCG imo, doesn't require any large finacial investment
~ The game seems complex enough to offer something for TCG veterans, but simple enough to allow begginers to enjoy themselves
~ Richard Garfield

CONS
~ The big one first THIS GAME IS PAY TO WIN, but like I don't know any "trading" card games that aren't
~ I can see this becoming very expensive with future expansions
~ Pay to pay to win, for real why you gotta charge me for the game? Is it cause you knew I would buy it anyway
~ I would like to see locked perspective so I don't get zoomed back in and can just stay at a distance
~ I sure there are more maybe I'll add some as I play more
bought the game, played keeper draft to get the most expensive one, sold those cards and recycled the one below 0.05$ to get tickets. Got the money back above the price of the game and got to play free draft forever. 10/10 would recommend.
Long time Hearthstone player and have become very burnt out on it. Been playing a ton of different card games the past 2 months and Artifact is by far the best of them.

For everyone that feels like bashing the game, yes! It is not F2P get over it. I have spent a lot of money on Hearthstone and so far Artifact really does not cost more to build up a collection. Most of the cards are dirt cheap and have been winning a lot of games with a deck that costs around $10-$15 and the cards in that deck can go into several others. There are a small handful of cards that do cost too much and I wish valve would implement something to prevent them from going that high but I can easily see the market getting more flooded over time and those cards drastically being reduced in price.

What I really love about the game not being F2P is that I no longer have to feel guilty to log in every day for daily quests and play decks I don't want to play and earn a miniscule reward. I value my time more these days and don't mind spending a little extra money to not waste it.
Buy this game for "Draft" mode, and it's F2P after your $20.  You can even sell your free starter packs and if lucky, turn a profit on the game.  Draft mode is interesting and rewarding.

If you're buying this game for constructed, then you're buying the wrong game.
I think people often gloss over the fact that, yes, whilst this game does not currently have a way to earn cards by just logging in and doing some random quest, there are a LOT of positives for TCG players out there:

1.  The gameplay is fresh, engaging, and rewards forward-thinking and problem solving.  The deck building is intuitive, and the game itself is easy to pick up, but difficult to master.  I have reached Legend in Hearthstone, I've been playing MTG for over 17 years, and I've played Eternal, Hands of the Gods, and other random TCGs, and I still think this is one of the best ones I've played.  Not better than MTG, but it's definitely in my top 3.  I truly feel like you have more ways to skirt around getting RNG-screwed than you would think.  Having a 3 lane setup gives you more chances to bounce back, even if you have a bad flop/assignment of targets/draw.

2.  Anyone who plays Magic the Gathering, knows that it is ENDLESSLY frustrating when you open pack after pack and don't get the key cards you need to complete your deck.  Casual fun and pack opening aside, buying 50 packs and never getting the cards you need is almost a waste.  You can still sell some of the cards MAYBE (same as in Artifact), but it certainly doesn't feel good.  So being able to pick up exactly the cards you need for a deck that you've constructed, is a boon, IMO.

3.  If you want to improve as a player, gauntlets reward that mentality.  If you improve enough at the game, especially draft, you get your ticket back, plus free packs.  I will say, however, I think restricting wins to 5 is lame.  Plus, you don't even really have to pay for tickets if you recycle extra cards, or just get at least 3 wins in a Gauntlet.  Not ONCE have I felt like I just auto-lose the match because the opponent has Axe and I don't, or has Annihilation, and I don't.  Whilst those are very powerful cards, there are ways to play around them with what cards you have.

TL;DR -- I do think that the current monetization model needs to be adjusted somehow, but I don't think it warrants complete ignorance of the positives this game has to offer.
I honestly think its a good game. It has its flaws but overall this is a very good and interesting TCG.

People might argue its a TCG that requires alot of money but it begs the question, doesn't every TCG require you to continuously buy cards and build new decks? The answer is YES. The obvious argument to this will be that real TCG and a digital TCG have different values, which is sort of true, however a digital version is more accessible making it easier to find opponents and people to play with, and when it obtains a larger base of players vs the real version of the TCG, then the value of cards will eventually decrease due to the influx of players. 

On top of that the marketplace is where players will sell their unwanted cards, and they are fairly cheap - most at the $00.05-$00.10 range and only the rare ones being in dollar amounts, and this is just when the game has just released. To give you my own experience as an example, i only spent roughly $20 and have made a few decks already, the only cards missing are the ones at the $5 or more range but I don't find those too  necessary.

If you compare this game to other TCG's, you'd realize that it costs much less to make a suitable deck and takes far less time to be competitive. I feel as though the initial asking price and people thinking that you having to buy cards makes it a bad game is ultimately the two problems people have right now, which is honestly sad when as stated above, it costs less and takes less time to be competitive. 

To anyone on the fence, buy it. Its worth its asking price even if you dont want to spend anymore after buying it. People will cry all they want, its too bad they're missing out on a great game.
No one seem to be reviewing the *actual* game. 
Most of the negative reviews have two things in common: Time played is less than ~8hrs, and the text is usually "pay2win" "game is expensive"
People go with the hate with zero rationality. 
----
I can't judge the game based on the few matches I played, but it seems really deep and challenging. I like it so far.
As a gamer of various formats (online, miniature, card) I can say that if Artifact was an actual card game I would still be paying for it. Considering that it is on PC means I don't have to pay so much to play it or even travel to play games of Artifact (very helpful as a dad). 

Paying AU 2.65 per pack of cards is fine, if you ask me. Sure, we don't get the immediate player base from having having a free to play model but in my experience a large percentage of those players will quit because of "pay to win" players. 

Artifact is an extremely fun game with intense depth that requires you to be switched on and thinking at least up to 6 turns ahead (2 rounds of 3 boards = 6 turns). The fact that players get to interact on a 1:1 card basis gives further depth. 

This game is definitely not for casual play.

You will enjoy Artifact as a DOTA card game. It really does feel like DOTA in a lot of ways.


Coming from a big CCG background and virtual card games alike, Artifact is amazing with the level of polish it bring to the table. The amount of intense battles and high level strategy involved just boggles my mind. This is the new MTG for online users. Artifact had Richard Garfield behind it and this game is only going to grow. I love Artifact!
Really fun and complex TCG. Payment model is akin to a real life TCG which I personally like, but I can see why some people who are used to free-to-play TCGs dislike it. 

The positives of the payment model are that instead of having to rely of RNG to get new cards (I.e Hearthstone), you can buy single cards to complete a deck (usually cost ~0.05 cents each; with a few exceptions). Plus your collection of cards actually retains value, so excess/ unwanted cards can be sold for credit on the steam market place. My collection from the complementery packs provided with the game is ~equal to the price of the game itself at this stage..

The negatives are that after opening the complementery starting packs there is almost no way to get any more free cards. I also wish you could directly trade cards with others rather than relying on the market place. I can see why this isn't allowed as Valve can't take a small cut... though why not make each direct trade cost a fraction of a cent or something?

Another aspect of this game which I think is in instelf worth games price is the phantom draft mode. In this gamemode you draft 60 cards over 5 packs to contruct a deck. You compete with this deck against random opponents until you either win 5 games or loose 2. While you don't keep the cards, the gamemode is completely free and is a great way fun way to learn the game. 

The community part of this game is at its current stage minimal. There is no competetive ranking system or profile stats, and the variety of cards is quite low. As this game has only just been released, I am certain that these features will be periodically implemented over future updates.
I still highly recommend this game, as it is by far the most fun and complex TCG I have ever played.

EDIT: Valve has recently released an update which addresses my criticisms of the game. Progression and social features have now been implemented. The most broken cards have now been nerfed, and some of the weaker cards have been buffed.
This game is very fun. For $20 you get to play with a number of decks in the Call to Arms event. You get 10 packs (100 cards), 2 starter decks and 5 game tickets you can use to play draft or constructed. Both of those modes allow you to potentially earn packs and more event tickets. The gameplay is interesting as well.
Well till now the game was enjoyable, but not always fair. For now im getting a bit bored since harly anything drives me to play constructed decks and i dont have enought freind to play tournament. 

What i missed is for example a detailed "card been used" overview,  Like i would see  a queue of cards used and a visuals to what card may have been used with it. Like coup de Grece would tell you what card disappear, but not what the card did.

Well i don't have money to spend , so i hardly can do anything after spending my tickets. Well that was fun

and one last request. PLEASE NERF AXE, like SRSLY.

Very Very good Game, it was never cheaper to buy a competitive Deck in ANY Digital Card-Game.
In every other Game (Hearthstone, Magic, Gwent, etc.) i paid manymanymany more because i HAVE to buy packs. In Artifact i can buy the cards i want direkt from th Community-Market.
The stories you tell with this game always sound like you're describing a Dota match. Luna kept getting ganked and never got strong enough to make a difference, so I lost that lane. BH and Drow dominated bottom lane and kept getting enough farm to get good items. Tried to roam at the wrong time and Zeus cleaned up all the damaged Heroes before I could get my spell off.

The gameplay is deep and filled with a crazy amount of decision making. Very quickly you'll be tracing the result of the game back to small decisions you made previously. ex. You wanted to get a kill on a Hero in bottom lane, so you used one more item, but that resulted in losing Initiative at the start of the next round and the Zeus was able to team wipe you despite having a Gust in hand. While there are some chaotic elements, you always have methods for mitigating them and counter-play.  The end result feels like you are commanding a battlefield, and reacting to the chaos and confusion of the fights and trying to send reinforcements where they are needed.

Deck building is very intriguing but I'm waiting for the market to settle down to buy more singles. Some pauper decks are already crazy affordable. It's nice to be able to grab a complete deck for under a $1 instead of buying packs and wasting time with crafting systems. It feels like good value when you spend money and the market is an interesting meta to play as well.

This in only the beginning and the type of game that Value and Garfield have created leaves me looking forward to seeing what's coming next. They've already created a deep TCG with more features than their competitors and I look forward to see how it grows over the coming years.
I admit, I am addicted to Dota 2. And now this card game is fully based on Dota 2. However, I will say this that many have I played card games and this one tops all of them. It's casual and serious at the same time, and other than the money, a person can actually have fun while strategizing. And that is on the first day of it's release, with many more updates to come still. It's a must try for any person that takes a liking to card games, and for even a person that doesn't, I can assure you that you will be hooked on this just as I got hooked on Dota 2.
Incredibly fun to play. I've played MtG a long time ago and Hearthstone more recently (including top 100 legend on NA) and Artifact is more fun than either of those games. Some top cards are expensive but not more so than hearthstone/mtg, just remember to buy on market and not packs. Some pauper decks are quite legit. Main complaint is lack of free ranked constructed, but hopefully  they will change that.
Such a mixed feeling. The game its self is amazing. I love the three lane system. Items, hero's, everything. 
but I Think the core problem of this game. Is if you don't have the right cards. (AXE AXE AXE, blink dagger) you can't rank games, you'll get screwed. 

I've done a few draft games. Last one I had Axe, how did I do? 5-0. Axe died 0 times. It's way to OP. That makes the game so unfun. 

It's a game where you need to use your brain big time. Sure it's a bit RNG as well but I don't mind that. 

Good game, but I wish they would give out a free pack, or a ticket ones in a while. If you are out of packs/tickets. You have to pay money for more. 


(BUT I FEAR OF EXPENTIONS WHAT COSTS WILL COME TO IT!)
It's surprising how many nail-biting, intense matches Artifact produces, and that's just from playing casual phantom draft. It's well worth the $20 bucks considering what you get compared to other 'f2p' digital card games. And the fact that you can just buy the cards you want if you're interested in constructed is a much more enticing prospect than buying/grinding for packs.

Game could use some QoL improvements, and additional modes like drafts with friends, but I'm sure many things will be added in due time similar to how Dota 2's features developed.
Its a really good game and i enjoy it so much. Havent spent anything more than the initial cost of the game, even sell my cards on steam and make more than 20$. Do your research, dont blindly believe those whiny negative review in here.
Amazing game. I only play expert draft.
draft is amazing, every other game is a finger nail bitter. that means really close games with both players trying different strategies to win.
I cant play too many games in a row cause my brain gets overwhelmed with things to strategize.
there are a lot of ways to win.
also, this game feels REALLY good when you win, and REALLY bad when you lose.
10/10
Don't let the people complaining about the monetization let you down, this is hands down one of the cheapest CCGs out there to build a competitive deck and play.
this is hard and fun to play. At my first 5 games i wanted to refund the game, couldn't so i tried again, making a deck playing with a friend, now i love it. I'm between playing dota or artifact, hard to decide. so tottaly recomended
as a player who hadn't come to this game after playing dota and with little prior experience in trading card games,i can assure you that artifact is a great buy.the game requires intelligence in deployment and making the right purchases in the card shop ,and the cards feel relatively balanced despite their severely varying price ranges(which by the way doesnt matter as the game will usually give at least one high-value card in your first 10 packs(i got drow ranger and tinker :D ) .it is friendly to both newbies and pros alike and will surely leave you begging for more.definitely worth the money.
I can definitely see why people aren't happy with the monetization model, and although some kind of pregression system would have been nice to have, I can easily say that artifact is the best card game that I have played.

The visuals and art style are simply beautiful and very high quality. The game also feels super smooth and vivid.

Valve tried something new here with the gameplay and the three lanes and it worked out perfectly. I've played for about 3 hours now and I've been having a lot of fun and enjoying myself. I love the way artifact works and I hope to see it evolve and expand more in the future.
A fun TCG.  Plenty to think about and theorycraft about.  A little complicated at first, but so is DOTA2. 

If you don't like trading or think you should get tradable cards without spending money then this is probably not the game for you.

If you dont want to spend money then play CASUAL PHANTOM DRAFT.  Everyone in that mode is on equal footing (no paid for cards), you'll get to draft from the full set of the cards, and its included in the base price of the game.


But if you want to play constructed decks then you will need to spend money to collect cards.


There's so much to love about this game. The gameplay is complex and every game feels like a learning experience. Many games are very close, and come down to a crucial decision somewhere in the match. The game has an awesome tournament mode that allows you to play custom formats with friends. Draft in this game is really fun, gives a lot of replayability, and makes for a different experience every time you play.  Yes, if you want to play competitive constructed you have to pay for cards, but that is offset by the fact that the cards themselves are inexpensive compared to other TCGs and CCGs, and they actually retain their value if you decide to sell them later.
Artifact needs some work still, but a lot of the negative reviews have unrealistic expectations. There are a few balancing issues but they aren't gamebreaking and are expected for a new card game. A lot of people are complaining about the price but this game is cheaper than most card games--they just don't like how up front it is with the payment model. Building meta decks in physical card games is SIGNIFICANTLY more expensive and even Hearthstone is arguably more expensive. It has a lot of competitive depth and I fully expect it to be solidly better than other digital card games in time.
i was really afraid from the microtransaction system but as an hearthstone player im here to say thats not really that bad as people make it to be, first of all yes you buy cards and you cant grind for them but in the other hand, here when you buy cards you can resell them in the market , for example opend up packs got 3 extra copies of a card worth 12$ , so that right here is enough to get me my money back / or get more cards , you can buy only the cards you would like aswell and this way cards retain value .

comparing to hs for example where you would farm for like 2 years for a god deck or pay 50 $ but cards there dont retain value when new expension comes out they disappear they even taken out from comp and go to wild.

now for those who cry this is not pay 2 win as everyone has to buy first of all.

and you can play phantom drafts and get new cards and use all cards all the time the game dosent make play with starter noob deck for the rest of ur life , the problem is adressed with drafts.

pros :
great animations
great gameplay
market system
drafts
you can get value out of any card in my opinion if played right.

cons:
long matches sometime 50mins
packs are a bit pricier i dont mind needing to buy cards as much as at least they should make bundles of 25 packs or so cheaper then make it the price of 1 x 25 thats really greedy 

From the perspective of magic and hearthstone, this game is relatively cheap.
From the perspective of most other steam games, this game is expensive.

Temper your expectations on cost.

Understand that most CCGs tend to be relatively expensive to other forms of entertainment.
No sane person who knows what they're getting into expects to pay $20 and have the most competitive deck in Hearthstone, Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh, or any other variant of the genre.
Try drafting if you're tight on money, and at the moment Casual Draft is free.

Overall the gameplay has been a ton of fun and I'm happy playing it. Definitely worth giving the game a chance. Games are generally close and feel rewarding to have played, win or lose.

There are a few glaring issues, like the ability to at least see your MMR or other small profile additions that I expect to be fixed hopefully in the near future.

Artifact is definitely worth your time.
The game isn't perfect, there are admittedly a few things missing that I'd like to see, such as trading cards with friends, rankings/leaderboards/level progression and some quality of life changes. However, the game plays very well, the mechanics are well thought out and fun to play, even against the bots.

People complaining about "P2W" and the "predatory monetization" obviously have not played a TCG before. Why should you expect to receive all of the cards for free? If you look at Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon TCG and others, the prices here are very fair. The game is setup in such a way that you can play for free through casual play (this includes preconstructed decks and the most popular, Drafts), or if you want to play competetive constructed, then yes, you will have to buy packs or single cards, just like in any other TCG.
The difference here is, due to the ease of selling cards on the market, you can build a decent deck for just a few $/£. The only expensive cards are a handful of heroes and spells that, while good, are by no means necessary to winning. 

It's fine to be put off by the ingame purchasing of cards, but I'd say its wrong to score the game down based on that fact alone. I wouldnt expect to walk into a game store and demand a full set of Magic cards for £15, so what makes this game different? The game has potential to be a serious competitor to some of the physical TCGs out there, and I say give it a chance before jumping on the "P2W" hate that's going around. There's plenty of fun to be had even at the base £15 (which by the way includes £15 worth of cards to start you off...).
The $20 pay wall prevents a lot of negatives like multiple accounts, smurfs, hackers, etc. The game itself is fun and I've had more fun with this than Hearthstone. The three lane dynamic really adds depth and forces you to process more information  to be successful. I've played ~40 hours so far and I'm frequently face-palming with some of the mistakes I do. 

You can trade cards on the market which is great. You can buy what you want and don't have to RNG open hundreds of packs if you don't want to. You can also sell rare cards you get but don't plan on using. If you check card prices most cards are below $0.20. Top tier decks you buy outright are ~$100. In other card games this goes well over $200.

Being a Dota fan, I have a much higher appreciation of the heroes/items/spells etc and it adds more enjoyment for me.

The pacing feels good. You will feel rushed when you start out but once you familiarize yourself with mechanics and basic strategy, you will have plenty of time. 

The visuals, UI and sound are fantastic and sleek.

Overall, Artifact is a good game that I would recommend. I've spent a total of $78 CAD which is ~$59 USD. Again, I've already spent 40 hours playing and plan on playing more.
The game is fantastic.  It's fun to play, pretty simple to pick up but there is a fair bit of depth.  I think the only downside from the gameplay side of things is that matches can take quite a while to finish up.  I don't think this would translate well to iOS or Android gaming.

As for the economy..... I spent less than $5 to fill in some gaps for cards I wanted.  In other card games I would have had to play for dozens and dozens of hours to get the packs I needed OR spent a LOT more than $5 to be lucky enough to get the cards I wanted or craft the cards missing.  If you're unemployed and have nothing but time on your hands then perhaps one of those games is for you.  Otherwise, the negatively about the economy is SOOOO overblown here.
If you know what you are getting into and you enjoy other CCG's, I think Artifcat is well worth your time. The design is fun and I dig the 3 lanes. I play a bunch of card games and I really think they have a great base for the game. Yes, it costs money to be competitive. I would say that drafting is an amazing way to play this game. 

I'm having a blast.
The game is fun, and isn't really "Pay To Win". The best part of this game is listening to SJW Socialist Gamers who know nothing about the game complaining that you can't play without spending more money on packs. It's ignorant, and not at all true. Yes your are locked out of playing with others who pay. Additionally the integrity of the card economy is maintained. Valve could not have done a better job, except allowing us to actually trade cards to friends.
this game is great. the strategic breadth and the satisfaction when outsmarting your opponent in unexpected ways is something that is just not comparable in other popular card games at the moment. beyond that, i really don't understand peoples frustrations with the pricing model. you get draft mode for free forever, which has basically infinite replay value and you get to play with all the cards, even the pricey ones. furthermore you get the purchase price in packs. beyond that, if you are only netdecking meta decks, then yes the credit card is your friend, but Artifact has what makes real TCGs great: you have to make the best of your ressources, get creative with what you have and come up with your own decks. It is not like there is a ladder to climb at the  moment. i find getting 5 wins with my own creation much more enjoyable then copypastaying whatever some streamer is playing. and it is viable here, which it is not on ladder in another card game.
The gameplay is pretty fun, but the randomness seem to limit your deck building possibilities in constructed. The interface has some bugs, but overall it is very clear and friendly. 

The initial card collection kinda sucks. You'll need to invest some money to build a decent deck, or you can just play draft. There is an option to create custom tournaments, so hopefully, a community of common-only (pauper) tournaments will rise soon. So far, I'm yet to see people playing custom tournaments.

The AI cheats so much to the point where playing vs bots gets boring rather than challenging, so don't waste your time playing solo.
If you want a card game with good depth and interesting mechanics then you should really look at Artifact.
The game was designed in a really interesting way.

Unfortunately there is a lot misinformation being spread around by Heartstone and Half-Life fans.
Artifact is actually a lot cheaper than other online CCG/TCGs in the market while also not requiring you to do a horrible grind like in games such as Hearthstone.
For only a few bucks you can get your deck since most cards by far are only 5 cents with barely any expensive cards.
You do not have to buy packs but if you were then every pack costs 2$ for 12 cards and every pack has a guaranteed Rare and Rare is this game's highest rarity. It's like if you were always getting a guaranteed legendary in every HS pack.

Most people seem to prefer Artifact's draft mode to constructed. I also really love draft which is the opposite than other online card games I played where Arena is incredibly boring and it is all about constructed.
Artifact offers completely free draft with no ingame or RL money required to participate in which means that you essentially get access to the entire card library for no additional cost. That is an insane deal and easily beats whatever these other CCGs have to offer.

About 30 hours into the game and I haven't spent money on it yet but I'll probably just buy a deck for a few dollars.
However I do not feel like I need to spend more money because of how good draft is and had a blast hosting some draft tournaments with my friends.


Highly recommend it to any card game players. Do not listen to the HS shills and HL fanboys.
I am still learning the game, but it is slick, and the game design is excellent. I'm an experienced card game player, and reading Artifact's complex board states is a fun challenge. Since I am still attempting to master the game mechanics and card pool, I have not tried the draft modes yet.

The longer term value of the game will depend upon the quality of future expansions. With only the base set out, it is way too early to comment on that.

The TCG model is attractive to me, in that I already play other card games that have daily quests. This way I can play Artifact when I feel like playing it, not to clear quests so that I can get a tiny increment to my card collection.
Only thing that bothers me is paying to play ranked and no ladder mod (ill just ignore it until it's fixed ), everything else is amazing and you should realy try this game if you dig card games or any kind of moba .
People are complaining upfront fee to play, but if you think about what you get, you get starter packs, dota+, arena tickets, and access to infinite casual draft play. (Which you can play with friends or host tournaments with). I thinkt his is a small price to pay compared to other card games LOL
People who give it bad ratings probably never even played the game and are just trying to freeload off the good works of others. I hope the game design stays relatively wallet friendly for those who want to continue doing constructed, but I think, given what we get for the price, it is worth more than the cost.
Thanks volvo
It's not that expensive. Funded the purchase of the game and several packs by selling old steam cards and TF2 items. Great game overall, lots of fun and creatively implemented. If you like League of Dota and you like cards, this is the game for you.
Game is great.  All the negative about having to buy cards.  If they give you free cards, my cards are worthless.

I do hope to see stat tracking and leaderboards soon though.

The box price is the cost of the packs you get (10 packs) + 5 event tickets and 2 terrible starter decks.
People will have their opinions on this game, it's missing some basic stuff (profile, stats, etc.), but it's a well crafted card game.  One in which will be like any other DCG that doesn't hide what it is selling you.  A table top inside DCG with a limited way of trade using the market place.  I say this is a niche game for a heavy group of card players, me included.  Casual's it is to note, that this game is worth 20 bux if you just want to get 4 friends to meet online once a week (or more w/e), and play a "sealed draft." Every game feels like you could have made a different play.  At the end of the way, it's a great game and the pay model shouldn't scare most of you.
8.7/10
This is a very deep and competitive card game. You can do unlimited phantom drafts for free, and obtaining a good constructed deck is much cheaper than similar games.
Game has been a ton of fun...definitely has actual depth to play a game and have seen several games where myself or my opponent made a misplay that cost one of us the game.  Really like how planning ahead and figuring out which lanes to play your cards in makes a difference.  I had played MTG in the mid-90's and Hearthstone for a bit.

I have played Draft (Casual and expert) as well as constructed (Casual only).  Draft sets a nice even playing field regardless of how much money you have spent on the game (have done well so far in draft 3 wins or more each time).  For constructed my deck (built out of 20 packs of cards) has been able to get me about break even (so would need to buy some cards to be competitive).  That being said you can play draft mode for free once you buy the game.

As for the Market and pricing It provides a good opportunity to build a deck at a relatively cheap price, but you do have to pay.  Since there is no free grind constructed is probably not for people who don't want to put money in but casual and draft modes are great.

TLDR: Great strategic depth. Draft modes is great and you can play that forever once you buy the game.  Constructed beyond playing with friends is probably just for people who want to pay money.  Get the game if you like Card games, but don't get it if you want to build a collection for free.

9/10

I've played thousands of hours of Magic, Hearthstone, and Gwent over the years, to give you an idea of my review credibility.

So far I'm enjoying the game a lot.  The feel, artwork, sound, lore etc I all like.  I have seen, however, a lot of negativity regarding the monetisation.  To me it seems reasonable given that the marketplace makes acquiring the cards you want less rng.  The only thing I dont like is that currently there is no progression when you dont spend anything.  I use the word currently though as Valve have mentioned they intend on adding a progression system.  So we'll see.  I think a lot of the negativity is down to players being loyal to other card games and maybe they are unwilling to admit even to themselves that they are reluctant to switch card games yet again.  Which is understandable givin that you can spend a lot of money on them and form a commitment.  If thats true coming up with excuses is pretty lame, and thats exactly what it seems like to me in some cases...

You can play for free after the initial purchase, and that includes constructed and drafting with no rewards.  If you have a specific deck in mind for expert constructed(entry price with rewards based on the amount of wins), it shouldnt cost too much extra with the marketplace.

Anyway, bottom line is I think its great so far, and has even higher potential with new sets and added progression.    

Did I mention its fun?
I'm new to trading card games and I love this game. The call to arms event with pre constructed decks really helps in learning the inner workings of the game and the strategies each card type employs. You can't get bored with this game. Also, I've played about 20 matches now and I've won about half, I lost a lot initialy but soon understood the game better and now I've been winning consistently. Almost every match that I lose now, I realise I could've won had I made better in game decisions. It isn't pay to win, you can get a lot of practice in the casual mode and slowly increase your confidence for the expert play mode that costs tickets(you start with five tickets). If you do well, the rewards are quite good.
Game is super fun and has hours worth of free content. Don't base your buying decision on the reviews here which only mention that it costs money..if you play/ed TCGs in real life, well then you know that it ain't a cheap genre
The game really needs a daily weekly and monthly card pack winning, just like MTGA. Or for me the game just starts to get boring leaves me with nothing to work for.
The way Valve monetizes this game is debatable, but it is a really fun game if you are up for strategic TCG gameplay. The free draft mode is more than enough to get you your money's worth, and if you decide to sell away the cards you get from your first 10 packs like what I did, the game won't even cost you that much (I made back almost everything, so the game is effectively free for me at the moment). Not a huge fan of shelling out money for cards just to play constructed decks atm, and very reluctant to spend money buying tickets to play the "expert" levels, but I would still recommend this game to fans of the genre.
Played both MTG and Elder Scrolls Legends a lot and just started playing Artifact this weekend. This game is something completely different. It´s difficult to foresee how each game ends and things can turn around quickly!
If you like card games with some complexity, this is definetly for you.
I see many review about the costs, but seriously Valve has been clear that this is not a freemium grind! 
With the 20 bucks for the game you´ll get 10 packs and some tickets, you could easily sell what you draw and most probably would have the game for free. You then can still play the casual draft and current event...
Or sell the cards and build a cheap competetive deck... you don´t have to send a lot of extra money.
I recommend this game.
Digital cardgames does normaly have two currencies, but in this one you can only buy things with real money. But unlike other games this one gives you free accsess to all game modes with out the need to pay. 

I mainly play becaus of draft and becus of that this model fits me fine.
Don't believe the haters. The monetization system for Artifact is the best of any online CCG. You have the ability to get any card you want at any time, with the average card costing around 5 cents a piece. In hearthstone, it is not uncommon to have to buy hundreds of dollars of packs to get the dust to craft the cards you need for the latest 'meta' deck. Lastly, your cards can be sold later and thus have an actual value.

Gameplay wise. It took me ten hours until it clicked. Do not be surprised if you feel like the randomness in the game leads to outcomes you had no control over. This was my impression initially and my biggest disappointment. With a more thorough understanding of the game play and the card interactions, I would say that there are more decisions to be made as a player each round than in most online card games. One of the other benefits of the gameplay is how interactive it is. You've all seen and played decks in other games that have a plan and and end up playing themselves. There is much more 'back and forth' with your opponent.  I would wager that in Artifact, the meta will feel more varied because the skill of the player has more of an effect than the deck itself. 

Artifact is a beautifully designed game with the depth I was craving. A+.
Love it soo much. and this is not just some sweet talk because for you card game lover, do you in the past get something after you win againts your friends or just some unknown? well something you are, but the most important thing that you should not forget is the FUN thing. that one is very important matter for game. FUN. and this game give it. if you want to say about you need to bought that all expensive card to win?  then you just not card gamer enough
I understand that some of these will be beating a dead horse, but this is my opinion. It was a close call for the recommendation.

Pros-
1. The ability to buy and sell cards.
2. Beautiful, complex gameplay, albiet effected by execessive rng.
3. Strategic depth.
4. Systems exist for free play.

Cons-
1. Lack of any sort of free progression. It doesn't have to be much, an occasionally drop of some sort would do, or make it so that draft actually has positive rewards. Cause there is no way you should expect to earn packs from the system currently.
2. $20 entry is just greedy if you know that most people are going to buy cards/ packs/ tickets anyways, although it is an amount that I would pay if done again.
3. Current social system is meh. While the ability to buy and sell cards exists, where is the trading? Although there is the concern of buying new accounts to have cheap packs or smth, have some sort of trading limits but let it be a thing.
4. Lastly, there aren't enough mechanics/ multi-colored cards but I'm sure that will be fixed as soon as a few more expansions come out. But that also represents an extra cost to enter constructuted.
I will say this, Artifact is an amazing game. Now, I might get a lot of hate about this, but hear me out on this though. I have been playing TCG's and CCG's for over 20+ years now. Started off with MTG, Yugioh, and Pokemon. As well as a few unpopular ones like Warcraft's original TCG. I have also spent thousands of hours playing Hearthstone, ESL, Eternal, and MTG: Arena now. Overall, I will say this game deserves a chance. However, I believe there need to be a few changes to open this up to a wider audience. While I below have more positives than negatives, the one negative I have is an substantial negative. Do I recommend this game? Of course! However, I believe we as a community need to voice our opinions about the game and make sure Valve understands that this game could be the best CCG, with a few minor tweaks. 

+Pros
- One of the best feeling CCG's I have ever played. 
- A great new mechanic when it comes to the "Lanes" to give it the DOTA / MOBA feel
- Great visuals and audio. The interactions with the cards and the soundtrack are great!
- A great mix of a variety of CCG's elements (MTG, Hearthstone, and ESL). 
- The variety of play styles (Casual, BOT's for training, Tournament mode, Competitive modes) are amazing! 
- The overall UI and smoothness of this game show's there was a lot of passion and dedication put into this project.
- It may be me, but I this game as an easy to learn difficult to master. Though, I have been playing CCG / TCG's for a long time.

+Cons
- There is no way to "grind" or a complete FTP model for this game. The reason I mark this as a negative is for simple reason is that not everyone has the capital to play this game, thus lowering the amount of players. Having the capital to buy every card doesn't make you a good player, excluding potentially amazing players from playing this game. Every other CCG (Hearthstone, MTG: Arena, Eternal, ESL), all have this. With the release of MTG: Arena very close to this one, it could push people away completely. The $20 entry fee I don't mind but, it could be used as a "bundle" to buy and TONS of people would still buy it. 


Its simply a great game. The whining about the economy is way overblown. Yes is you wanna play a top tier constructed deck, it will cost you some money ( not as much as people want you to believe though).
On the other side: Draft and the event decks are great and totally worth the 20$ alone. 
I have been playing games for almost 20 years and its been a long time since is played this much on a single weekend. Every new draft is a completly new challenge.
10/10
This game is delightful. The three lanes and the amount of RNG make each game feel very different - being able to react to changing conditions through tactical decision making is significantly more important than in other card games i've played. Deckbuilding is important but less so than in other card games. I think it will take a long time before this starts to feel repetetive. I love that they've solved the problem of mana screw in a straightforward and thematic way but in a way that leaves for more exciting decision making than something like HS. And i think more than in any other card game i've seen, a very strong player with a very weak deck could easily defeat a weaker player with a stronger deck, due to the high skill ceiling created by the interaction of the RNG and the laning and hero deployment mechanics.

I love the thematic and mechanical parallels to dota2 - they've really captured the spirit and some of the strategy in that game here in Artifact, in a lot of suprising and wonderful ways. The overall balance of the game and the cards seems more or less fine so far in my amateur opinion, and i'm excited to try out a bunch of different decks with different color and hero combinations.

The production quality is top-notch. Incredible UI and sound design. The quality-of-life features in the drafting, deckbuilding, and collection interfaces is unheard of. building and sharing decks is incredibly streamlined.

That being said, the game is missing a few things i would expect from a modern competitive game... (optional) chat, competetitive ladders, a replay system, etc.. I'm confident that these will come eventually, so it's not a big deal.

A lot of people used to other digital CCGs are complaining about the monetization model. I was skeptical at first, but i believe valve has done this right. The unlimited free ('phantom') drafting is worth the price on its own. In addition, i immediately bought all of the common cards and some of the better uncommon cards for less than $5 total - more than enough for a lot of deckbuilding and dynamic play, especially among friends or in the 'Pauper" (commons only) community.

I understand that due to exchange rates, this game is prohibitively expensive in other countires, and that's too bad. I hope valve figures out a way to address this to make the game more afforable outside of the US, without undermining the stability of the card market (no small feat, i would imagine).
After playing, and paying for, hearthstone the initial cost to get into this game (IF YOU WANT TO PLAY CONSTRUCTED) is pretty minimal imo.  I would like a way to earn cards with paying for all of them but if you dont want to pay you can play phantom draft or if your friend has a deck you want to play you can 1v1 each other and share decks.  its a fun concept
i think still many unbalanced cards , ljust like a card described as condemn a hero with discard a card, it should like discard two cards in the field or something for a hero
What you should do it for start this game?
1.See youtube
2.Play Bot Gaming
3.Buy a pack from the market

Gameplay:
it's very unique with three board that you can play at the same time
this game was about how to deal with two tower or going crazy to rax the throne
very simple mechanic but with a complex gameplay
pay attention for tyring to figure which board your hero will deploy and going where your creep to deploy
it was all randomize for the hero for the first play and everytime creep spawning

In game Feature:
there are no free card
should buy from market or open a few pack to play constructed or going for tournament
recycle just for ticket around a half dollar to get 20 card for recycle

it was 8 out of 10 for me






Draft modes in this game are great, and there's a free draft mode unlike some of the other card games out there.

The gameplay is solid and lots of matches are extremely close and exciting to play.

Most of the complaints for this game are from the economic model and lack of progression elements.  Progression elements are top priority for the next update and this is a TCG so I'm not sure why people are upset that they will have to put some $ in to get a constructed deck.  If anything the steam market will lead to a lower overall cost to get specific decks rather than chasing cards through buying tons of packs.  Which you can still do if you like that aspect of TCGs.

In any case I'm having a ton of fun just playing draft.
People are retarded the monetization of the game is probably the best. I bought for 10e cards I sell my double cards for 15e today. What other cards game do this? Certainly not hearthstone where you have to pay 200e every 3 month if you want all the interesting cards. Here I want a card I just bought it no need to open 60 boosters.
Ok I never leave reviews because really what hasn't already been said about a game but this game is new and there seems to be a lot of [strike]hate[/strike] confusion towards the play model. While you do have to pay $20 dollars to "play" the game this is no different than if you bought one of those starter deck packs they sell in the store for yugi-oh, pokemon or even magic. The difference between those guys is they don't include 10 packs with those bundles. Now those 10 packs you get you can open them all up and sell all those cards and probably make back your $20 or maybe even make some money. After that you don't even need cards to play the game. All the casual modes even the draft mode (casual) allow you access to all the cards even if you don't own them. However you won't be able to play expert mode without the cards. Hearthstone does not allow this. You want to play casual you have to own the cards. Arena sure you don't but you are going to need to pay for it (gold or money). Artifact you get to play both modes at no additional cost (read that again "no additional cost"). This way you can practice get better and then if you want you can move to the next level which is expert play. Which yeah will cost you tickets (one except keeper draft) but it you practiced then hopefully you are winning enough to get back your ticket (2 wins) which isn't like Hearthstone where you need to win at least 6-7 games to make back your gold. 

So to sum up you want to jump into a game that gives you all the cards to play (casual mode) for a one time price of $20 or you could play hearthstone which lets you grind for the cards you want that by the time you have all of them they release a new expansion.
Despite many reviews, Artifact has by far the fairest monetization model of any card game out there. It makes wonderous use of the digital format, and the gameplay has enough levels of intricacy to entertain beyond its current lack of ranking or progression system, although those features will be much needed down the line.
The complexity of the game may faze some people. However, personally, I don't think it will discourage most people from trying to learn it. In my humble opinion, the game can be very fun due to that very reason, it's complexity. The depth of the game allows us to deploy many strategies even with the limited number of currently released cards. The same complexity also allows both players to always have winning chances, despite your deck quality (i.e. price), and always provide chances to make tide changing counterplays. The constant exciting go and forth battle prevents every turns from feeling stale and hopeless. Even when you're losing badly, suddenly you can win in just one turn with a lucky draw. Of course, the opposite can happen.

Conclusion : (in my opinion)
    winning in Artifact : 50% luck + 35% skill (drafting and playing) + 15% (deck quality)
A well designed card game with depth, polish, and a compelling IP. Just a few weeks after launch we have balance changes and a progression system added. Looking forward to the release of new card sets and eventually a mobile OS version. Don't underestimate Valve.
Great, challenging gameplay with a lot of variety and complexity for high replayability. I hate microtransactions and P2W scenerios, but this isn't as people are describing. I'm actually a huge fan of this market model for *COLLECTOR* card games. I can buy individual cards, most of which cost <.05 and accrue as I want.
Oh my God. I just played a draft deck and it was a total nail biter. I barely pulled the win out my butt in the end. I've never had this much fun in a card game before and I have played them all like Hearthstone, Gwent, Magic The Gathering, Duelyst, The Elder Scrolls: Legends, Eternal, Faeria, & Shadowverse. I've only had to spend $20.93 cents so far too. If you don't want to spend money on constructed decks which are lame anyways because people will just look online at tier lists and buy OP decks instead I recommend playing Phantom Draft!
If you are the one who finding a free to play game please skip this but if you are the one who love to play (or ever played) a trading card game (in physical) you will love Artifact.

Artifact have same model with physical trading card game but in digital platform.
You can buy or sell any card you want in market and you won't get any card for free.
Yes, there are game modes that require you to pay more. Price is definitely a factor but varies between people so just decide yourself. You can always check the price of a certain card or game mode.
Casual Phantom Draft doesn't cost anything extra and doesn't rely on your card collection.

I have fun playing the game itself. The gameplay is complex and getting better feels rewarding.
What else can you ask for?


The mechanics of the game are great. In my view, revolutionary even. First, mana and spell system: gone are the days of magic where at least 25% of games you lose just because of mana screw or mana flood. Also, drawing 2 cards each turn means you are a lot less reliant on RNG / top deck/ luck. in fact, luck plays smaller part in the game then a lot of other card games like heartsone which are now all about praying to RNGesus.

The game is super interactive and fun - you can do a lot to mess with state of the board and your opponents plans. Majority of games come to the wire and reward wiith real sense of achievement when you win.  


A lof of people seems to be not recommending the game because of monetisation model - it is not a F2P model. Whilsts you can play a lot of modes for free - including drafting which is simply amazing- to earn new cards you do have to put in money. Maybe you don't think it is "fair", especially if you are just a casual player - but don't kid yourself that it is more expensive then Magic or Hearstone if you play seriously / competitavely. 

First, top decks in Magic cost way more (both online and physical versions). 

In Hearstone, each new expansion costs you around $40 and will only give you a fraction of cards which you will never be able to convert back into real world currency. If you think that is a better "deal" you really should go back to math class in school.  


This is, without a doubt my new favorite card game, because i would rather purchase the cards that i want for my deck, than open pack after pack hoping for the CHANCE at the cards that i need.
What a great game, seriously no pog or pepe. everyone calling the game pay-to-win has never played a tcg in their life apparently because that is what this game is. A virtual trading card game, you know how we have physical cards we buy like mtg, yugioh, pokemon etc? well picture that but virtual cards thats all. So it isn't pay-to-win its just a VTCG game that is doing it right. Combining dota and mtg is surprisingly awesome. Buy the game, get some packs, and have some fun.
Its a fun card game. Its not quite as rich and deep as MTG, but its defintely up there with fun. Decks do cost money but the cost of keeping up with Artifact is so much lower than MTG, making it way more accessible. If you're expecting a Hearthstone style free-to-play sort of game, this isn't for you. If you're looking for a more accessible TRADING card game, this is worth it.
Gameplay is solid. Economic model is actually very fair. Don't compare the payment model to Hearthstone. After you buy the game, you can buy cards for $0.05 and make a deck for $5.00. You don't need to buy any packs. It's actually cheaper than Hearthstone where you have to spend $50 on packs
The game is definitely far from free, but what good games are free these days?
Oh thats right games that throw ads in your face and show you all these bundles you can buy to enchance the game.
Paying for this game gets you a bunch of boosters and 2 decks to get you going, if you ever played physical TCG those would of cost you LOTS of $$$$$, for around $2 per pack is really reasonable considering it gives you 12 cards including a rare. All cards are marketable and are selling for cents! Plus it doesn't matter how strong or rare your cards are, there is the element of RNG heavily weighing on this, and one mistake can set you back a round. So for all those simple minded people that are having a cry over paying for a game, you pay for a game your supporting the development behind it. This game has an endless strategic charm to it. Building the right deck is impossible but endless fun.
Social Play and Online play are free, competive play cost event tokens but theres no ranking or anything so its kinda pointless. Event mode is fun you and your opponent use pre-made decks, just like other modes.
Definitely worth playing.
Super fun game.  Very deep.  Definitely has a learning curve, but I have already seen myself improve in a few hours.  There are a few cards that feel poorly designed (e.g. Cheating Death... groan), but that happens with just about any CCG.  Animations are sick. The overall polish in this game is astounding. Every card in the game has a character voice over narrating the card's lore.  That's insane.  

I'd wager that 90% of the negative reviews are people upset that this game is not free to play.  That's the epitome of entitlement.  IMO the game is very reasonably priced and there are plenty of game modes that people who don't want to invest a lot of money into the game can play around with.  What's more, at this point, is that it is virtually impossible for anyone to NOT know that the game is not free to play.  If the pricing model doesn't work for you, go play something else. 
 Its not like there aren't several other F2P options.  This game is still worth checking out though.
This is hands down the best card game I've ever played. People giving it negetive reviews had different expectations because most games of this type have a free to play model. Trust me the business model for artifact is FAR superior to a free to play one. I absolutley detest daily challenges and the like, its refreshing to have a game where the game play is the only thing that matters and not grinding out free currency. Valve has actually done the right thing here ethically and intellectually, its a shame that people don't realize. This legitamately deserves a 98% score. If you like this type of game at all you will love Artifact, don't be misled by the negetive reviews.
This isn't Hearthstone, you're going to enjoy the actual gameplay way more and not feel compelled to even buy new packs. The phantom draft feels like im playing a new game of dota every time. Its well worth the money even just the base pack. I haven't even used my arena tickets yet.
Game is extremely fun.

The economy model is going to get hated on, but it's better to go in not expecting Hearthstone. 2 initial starter decks plus 10 free packs is a good start. You have to earn your free packs. But you can trade in your cards for steam wallet money and buy the specifc cards you need. Most cards are under a dollar, with the commons being around 4 cents. Yeah there are some cards that can be expensive, Axe is 18 dollars at the writing of this, but it is exactly like buying cards and packs for games like Magic. 

Overall, you can still make some good decks with the cards you have. You may have to spend some more money, but I personally prefer this type of economy since you end up being able to get what you want, rather than hope for free packs. Does it make it pay to win? Yeah, at least outside the draft mode. But all card games are pretty much pay to win, and I cant justify calling that a negative in this game, when it happens in others. 

The game isn't perfect: no progression system and games can take a little too long sometimes. But there is a lot of depth and strategy that makes it an absolute blast to play. I'd recommend watching some youtube videos to really grasp the game first too.

I have found that this Community  (the people who acturly play the game)
Really like it, and like sharing the fun with others.
Even when i beat a player i usaly get a friend invite, and a message saying, "Nice play", or like "Wow, cool combo, gotta try that next time"

Im positivly sure, that in a week or so, the game have found its Normal state.
Where the people who is buying it, playing it. LIKE IT.
And by then the marked for card have been flooded with the extra cards from the people who left. who want the money back for the "good cards"
Reall like is so far. I do wish there was a way to slowly earn yourself some more card packs like in hearthstone. you can buy playing competitive but if you already dont have "Axe" or some of the good cards, (or in my case the game offten crashes) then its going to be difficult for new or low ranked player to progress other than buying packs. Overall very fun game, like to see where it goes. Ive put in like 13 hrs. and still not tired of it.
It's super fun. And innovative. But with a pay wall, and no way to earn additonal cards through hard working and determination, at what cost? Thumbs Up beacuse it's great. Thumbs Down because I don't believe it is sustainably great.

I wrote a thing about it: [url=https://tigrefuego.kinja.com/valve-s-artifact-and-the-socio-economical-implication-1830799460] Valve’s “Artifact” and The Socio-Economical Implications of Pay-Gated Competition [/url] 

I'll let you know in a couple months, if still relevant.
Pretty amazing gameplay. Very deep and tactical. And RNG is mitigated into 3 lanes so that you will have a whole bunch oppurtunities to come back or change plans. Every loss feels like you could have done something better to turn it around.
And the DOTA feel is just sweet. They nailed it with the mechanics.

To be fair deckbuilding is MUCH MORE cheaper than any other card game around where in HS you need to spend a couple hundred every expansion to craft legendaries where in Artifact you can just buy unowned cards from other players without buying a single pack. But, ALL of the rewards in this game are gated behind paid tickets... If people cannot casually win small rewards and progress slowly without paying for tickets, I don't see players keep coming back in the long run. I reall like this game, I hope that wont be the case.

Also there MUST be a nonpaid ranking system as well. 0,0 



I first heard about Artifact through my MTG friends. I being turned off by the monetization model, as well as just generally not having any interest in a DOTA card game (I mainly play League). In fact, I completely wrote the game off.

Then, as release got closer I began to see gameplay, and let me tell you guys it looked GOOD. Hearthstone's one sided turns always felt boring to me, and so I looked more into Artifact. $20? That didn't seem too ridiculous of a price to me, especially compared to how much games can cost. So I bought it on a whim.

And I absolutely loved it. I spent the first few hours losing literally every game I played, rebuilding my decks, opening packs, and trying again. I was a bit put off by the fact that I could only buy packs with money, but the cardpool was small and the game was fun, so I let it go. Then, I saw the 'sell card' tab.

I freaked out, in a great way. You could trade your cards to other players, and then buy what you wanted?! You could get every card without opening a single pack? I was hooked. I've spent about $60 on the game, including the buy in price of $20, and have been able to make decks very similar to what's seeing tournament play. For $40 more, I could not only make several diverse decks, but I could also make some fun rogue ones too! (Currently, I'm looking at a stunlock deck) Admittedly, I did get lucky (opening both Drow Ranger and Axe in packs, each of which is $15-$20 at the time of writing), but that doesn't change the fact that this model, in my opinion, is either comparable or better than any other online TCG. 

To put it simply, I spent $60 on this game. That's about equal to the Rakastan preorder price for Hearthstone, a super budget deck for MTG, or a AAA game. For me, as someone who loves card games, this is insanely cheap. To build a competitive deck in Magic, which has the closest model to this with actual trading, you need to spend between $200 and $600 for a competitive, pro level deck (link for those curious: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/tournament/pro-tour-guilds-of-ravnica#paper). For Hearthstone, that gets you a preorder (50 packs) and some change. Assuming you open a legendary every ten packs and an epic every four (pity timer is 20 and 8, respectively, so I feel like that's a fair estimate), you'd end up with five legendaries (plus the free one you get for logging in), 12-ish epics, and 50-ish rares. You could then dust what you don't want and make a decent deck if you got lucky, but in the end you only opened a quarter of the legendaries, about half the epics (but you need doubles, so a quarter of the full set), and enough rares and commons (link to the full set: https://www.hearthpwn.com/guides/6052-rastakhans-rumble-card-reveals-and-details-for). 

The math could be wrong, but I tried to get it as close as I could. My point is: the game's great. It's not F2P, so if your goal is to play a game without paying a cent, that just can't happen here. It's not a free game, and it's designed to be closer to a physical card game than an online one. In the end, it's up to you if you want to play it or not, $20 is a lot when you can play other card games for free, but I hate seeing so many people turned off by the price. I really enjoy the game, and I just want you guys to be able to enjoy it too!

Anyways, feel free to add me if you want to talk more about this, or just want to play some games!
Don't believe the people that are jumping on the dumb pay2play cryfest bandwagon.

I was hesitant to buy this because as a viewer with no idea about the game, it was confusing and a little boring. My little brother was excited, got it and said it was amazing. I trusted him and picked it up. Artifact turned out to be an amazing game - while it looks overwhelming it's actually pretty simple once you get past the tutorials. The biggest thing to look out for is managing the value of your cards and using that to fund decks that you would find fun or interesting. There are plenty of ways to play for free and on equal footing with other people (such as drafts). It doesn't feel as random or unpredictable like Hearthstone - in fact BECAUSE there are 3 lanes there are plenty of ways to plan your strategy and execute. Gameplay feels comfortable, quick, and responsive.

All the noobs that are crying about pay2win are also the ones who don't know how to maximize their economy from their starting packs and tickets. It's pretty easy to break even if you play a halfway decent deck (there are some super cheap ones that you can buy after selling some of your starter rares). Or if you can't build one, participate in expert drafts.
The game is very good and very tense, and I definitely recommend it for number crunchers and people that like strategic card games. The pricing model appears to not be everyone's cup of tea, but I personally think it's nice to copy a deck in from a deck site and buy all the cards in it for a total of like one dollar then be able to go right away. 

The pricing structure is more like a paper TCG, rather than an online one, and I think that's totally ok and in many ways preferable for people who have any amount of investment in the steam marketplace (sell a couple DotA items or CS:GO skins or TF2 items or Steam trading cards, get a full deck in this game). There are plenty of free modes to play, and if you're comparing it to paper MTG, it's nice to have your deck and be able to play any time against other people, because, you know, the game is fun and we play games because they're fun, not because of an arbitrary progression system.

There are some features that are missing though:
- the tournament system in the game is GREAT but is lacking a spectator mode, why launch without this?
- apparently there is no unranked matchmaking ranking system, I really hope this changes
- The mobile version is not available for another half year or so, bummer that we have to wait so long for that

There are quite a few random aspects to the game that I don't quite know how to feel about yet, but my games have been very tense and fun so far.
I don't usually do steam reviews, but as filthy casual addict to Dota 2 and Hearthstoe I figured I'd make some effort to make sense of Artifact.

The first thing that struck me was I don't think either game provided any particular perparation, other than maybe trying to think a few steps ahead of your opponent which could be said of any multiplayer game I guess. The wierd thing about Artifact is there is a large portion of the game which you don't control, including where your first three heroes are deployed, where your creeps get deployed, and how they attack. 

The effect is almost like you act as a 'coach' might in a Dota match, you choose what spells to play, and where to deploy heroes once the game has started (you don't pick the first 3 but from them on you do). It makes for quite an odd gaming experience that I'm still trying to figure out - much of the game is decided from choices you make a few steps earlier, for example in one match I flubbed it purely by placing my heroes in a lane that they weren't needed and basically couldn't do anything in the lane they did need help.

So is it any good? I'm still trying to figure this out!

The nature of the game is slightly dry, because the skill is largely in planning matches can feel quite boring and because the play is somewhat counter-intutive it lacks the satisfaction of making a great play that Hearthstone does. A turn can often consist of players just buffing and improving their heroes to try and avoid the dreaded "Red cross" that signals they'll die in the combat phase. It's a great logistical challenge but I wouldn't call it fun.

Also in my humble opinion the matches last slightly too long, because the games are heavily strategy focussed there is a lot of time spent staring at a static screen planning the next move which is pretty gruelling over a 20-30minute times. I guess I expected something much faster that a Dota match as this would be a different niche.

On the postive because the game is hard and surprisingly well balanced (it seems rare to achieve a complete stomp) it is satisfying to get a win, and when your plays do come together Valve have managed to create a similar satisfation as in Dota but in the Artifact Context.

It's probably illegal to doa review and not mention the montization/whatever. Comparing largely to Hearthstone I have mixed feelings about the system. Hearthstone's currency system is absolutely seeped in Behavioural Principles (e.g. variable ratios and time based reinforcement schedules) and while very enjoyable is disturbingly well designed to draw real money out of people. 

Artifact on the other hand just seems kind of random. Being able to grab the cards you want, largely for very cheap doesn't really break the bank, but does create a sense of blandness to the transaction. Having to pay for tickets just seems more annoying than anything especially given the game has a baseline cost. I strongly suspect Valve will rethink that aspect - again it lacks any sort of intuition. Possibly in the future players will be offered a few tickets per week but be able to pay for  more?  

Finally, maybe I'm just an idiot but I don't find the deck-building or draft easy to follow, I'm sure there could be slightly better ways to follow it, or at least slightly less ambiguious instructions.

I think for me I'd plod through a few matches each day, and look forward to new game modes, and hopefully some of my fav heroes to appear (Techies I'm looking at you)
As a long time Trading-Card-Game player this game is absolutely fantastic.
Included in the price of the game are 5 card packs and 5 tickets(tickets use further described below).
Through the market you have access to all cards of artifact.
Unlike Magic the gathering´s Arena or Hearthstone there is no need to buy additional card packs and you can sell unwanted Cards in the community market or recycle them into tickets which are needed to play draft/constructed challenge series which reward card packs as prices.

Its unusual setup where you play 3 lanes(fields) at once with switching initiative (initiative holder is the player who does the first action of the turn) is a little confusing at first but after a few games is just as easy as other card games but rewards the player with a deeper strategic process of playing and more control of the gameflow.

I really like this game and see positive for the further development of the game, like the introduction of a global ladder ranking system, which is not in the game yet (at the time of this review).
The most fun, complex, engaging, and strategic card game out there. The price of the game isnt that bad really, people are going to hate cause its not f2p, its worth every penny yuou put into it. 

Bought most of the cards i needed from the market place and made 3 really good decks. I also got lucky and opened a few drow rangers and sold for $9.

Im really excited about this game, i think it has a lot of potential, the future is bright for artifact. If you want a stratigic and complex card game where your decisions matter and every game is unique and fun, this is it!
4.5*
It is a great game.  Very polished.  I thought that they will be in beta phase for a year.  I think its ready to go.  I want to see more elements of artifact into dota such as golems or summoned  based units.  If you never played MTG Magic The Gathering and spent hundreds building the best OP deck you can, then this game might not be for you.  If you want to learn how to play turn based card games then give it a try it is worth the $.  All of you Yugio and Pokemon players should be fine.
Core gameplay is very fun and addicting. Infinite phantom draft is the way to play right now. Expert modes are fun but might need some tweaking for the rewards, keeper draft isn't really worth playing for the extreme cost. Everyone complaining about the cost is being ridiculous. $20 for unlimited phantom draft, preconstructed events, tournaments etc is easily worth it. The business model is way less predatory than something like Hearthstone or MTGA where you are forced to waste money (or grind hours every day) in an attempt to get something you want, while in Artifact you can just pay $1 for a competitive budget deck.
Artifact is the kind of game that grabs you and just does not let go.
It is very complex and challenging. Offers great insight into the Dota lore and has potential for much more.
The initial packs and tickets get you to a good starting point and let you expand your collection without spending any money.
And there is also the market where you can find any card and most of them dirt cheap so you could make a deck for less money than a pack.


I was waiting for a proper TCG for years now. No grinding. Only skill and strats.

Guys in the end you have to decide if you want to grind your ass away for some RNG cards, which most likely only give you duplicates, which lead to dust, which is needed for building a proper deck in hearthstone.
Many many hours of playing lacking decks...

Can`t be said about Artifact. You can buy every card you need. you can sell any card you don`t need.
I built my deck with about 10€ extra after the original purchase and I`m all set for competetive constructed!

In the long run, Artifact is way cheaper and much deeper than hearthstone.

And please don`t worry about no progression. The game just came out. Valve will surely fix this.
Artifact is a fun game. So far I've just been playing casual phantom draft and its been great, definitely worth the price. The game mechanics are interesting and the drafting method is a lot more enjoyable than hearthstone as you have a lot more scope to focus on the style of play you like, while still having enough randomness for it to be interesting. I like the fact that you dont feel compelled to grind quests etc to slowly build up coins, it makes it more enjoyable overall as you aren't playing to grind, you're playing because you enjoy it. The game is really enjoyable and well worth the very modest price.
extremely fun, very deep and complex. incredibly rewarding to learn and play. people complain about the microtransactions of the game, but it isn't bad at all. 3/5 wins gets you your money back in the form of 1 ticket. 4/5  and 5/5 wins = you are making money. 

the marketplace is absolutely amazing as well. 10/10 would recommend.
why everybody seems so mad, it's just like any other card game in real life you need money to obtain more of pack/cards, just because this game is digital doesn't mean it must have its 'grinding way'.
It's a very fun game. Not perfect, but with time and more cards, I believe it can be truly great. The marketplace is extremely accessible and anyone saying otherwise is probably pretty young, unemployed, or has way too much time on their hands.
I love this game, it really scratches an itch that I have, and this is quickly becoming one of my favourite games. The stratergy is so deep and I trust in Valve to keep the game interesting and listen to the community on how to improve the game.

If you are concerned about money then do some research into what you get for the price, don't just listen to what others say as everyone has different expectations from the game. As a player who loves draft modes the price tag is a bargin, but if you are only interested in constructed then be prepared to pay some additional cost to keep your decks updated, you will be able to make some competitively viable decks on a budget but there probably will be some archetypes that are expensive without replacements.

This game certainly isn't for everyone, but if you think it might be for you I highly recommend it.
I paid Artifact solely to support DotA in the beginning. Then i played it and got hooked which is something that never happened before in any other card game, not even with Magic: The Gathering.
The DotA universe keeps expanding for the better!
      Game is actually amazing! Fun to play with your friends! DRAFT MODES are SUPER popular so not having all the cards isnt an issue...only complaint is wish they had events or daily missions to earn tickets/cardpacks so free2play and progression would feel nicer. All things considered marketing/gameplay aspects are great. I have high hopes for the future of this game and im sure they will add more to ease players into gettting cards as they release more and more sets. If you ENJOYED Magyk the gathering you will feel right at home here :) 

8/10*
Fun, deep, and engaging gameplay. Not sure people complaining about the monetization model know what they're talking about. So far I've just used casual phantom draft, and have recouped all my losses in more competitive modes by getting a few wins here and there. Haven't spent a penny more than the initial cost and am having a really good time.
Deep gameplay, great marketplace providing options to get cards other than opening packs. Great overall, card balancing is still in early stages, do give it some time
For everone who likes limited in card games, get it. Its more complex than HS and others, ton of fun and YOU CAN DRAFT FOR FREE.
....who cares for constructed. Got it for 20 bucks and will be playing limited all the way. Maybe pauper if that is going to be a thing (custom tourneys hello).
ignoring the monetization model (which to me feels more fair than that of hearthstone, but i understand why someone might not like it) the game is really compeling and enjoyable, graphicaly the game oozes charm, mechanics are all well thought out, i would recommend if you know what you are buying, which is more complex card game with open market.
Pretty fun game so far. I like how your hero cards have inventory and can be upgraded. The one criticizm I have is the difficulty to gain cards and that they try to get you to buy more after you bought the game.
Beautiful, atmospheric and complex game.
It is true that this game was not made for everyone (card game, very complex, hard to master, not f2p).
But if you do enjoy such type of games - Artifact would be 11/10 for you.
Highly recommended for those who know what they seek.
its a fun game. People reviewing are basing it only on money. Fun fact, all card games are paid to win. And this isn't even that bad of a paid to win game because all the cards are going to be cheap to buy on the market.
Coming from many other popular TCG/CCGs, the price of this game is surprisingly low. And although there are some technical issues every now and then(played on MacOS), the mechanics, the artstyle, the sound/music of this game is spot on.

Note that this game is complex and is unforgiving for the majority of new players. Compared to Hearthstone, there is no reward for players by just participating "expert" plays and it costs player-resources to participate, unless a player is really good at this game and may potentially go infinite with Phantom Draft for example. 

TL;DR
Get this game if you have some budget to allocate and/or a card veteran player who enjoys just by playing the game and not getting any immediate reward;
Stay away if you expect the labelled price of this game will provide a full competitive constructed gameplay experience, or if you're unwilling to practice with friends, against bots or casual Phantom drafts
Game rules. I would rather have access to casual draft and card trading than the free-to-play grind model. This is an actual trading card game. Way to bring it to the digital marketplace.
Fun and demanding game with a, in my opinion, superior monetization model compared to similar games on the market. Buying individual cards lowers the cost for the game drastically because you don't have to rely on RNG and a poor recycling system to get the ones you want. 

I see myself enjoying this game for quite a while.
a lot of people have a lot of complaints about this game but from my experiance its one of the best card games out of there.

lets start with the gameplay, its probably the most deep gameplay and least RNG dependent card games ou there, every match i play i feel like theres something i can do better, a better deployment, holding intitive, targeting better, abandon this laner, save that one, push here. the list goes on and on, theres always something you can learn.

next lets address the monitization model, while i will admit its not great that you cant get event tickets for free in the game at the time of writing theres more then a fair model backing this up, you have casual phantom drafts FOR FREE for as long as you want to just play, not to mention that unlike EVERY other digital card game you can just buy the cards you need from the steam marketplace! one of the most expansive and easiest places to use, and not only that because you can also sell all the cards you dont need to get the cards you need, i think that a lot of people are really underestimating how impactful this is on the ingame economy because you get 5 event tickets for free and can esily go infinate with those 5 and get packs for free then sell those cards for steam credit and buy the cards you want, its totally possible to buy every card you need just by playing the game and being slightyly better then the average player (51% win rate)

so in conclusion, it has deep tacticle gameplay and a fair yet underrated monitazation model, all in all this is probably the best digital card game ive played in a long time and iver played juust about all of them.
Artifact is fun. There are a ton of free modes. You only have to spend money if you want to own cards (and they are relatively inexpensive). Plus being able to buy cards, specific ones you are looking for, from other players takes the RNG out of having to open packs to get the card.

Not everyone likes the fact you have to pay for owning cards, but if there were free/easy ways to get cards there would be an over saturation of the market place in no time. Kind of underminds what a trading card game (TCG) is, and comparing this game to HearthStone doesn't make a lot of sense because they are 2 different kinds of busy models. HearhtStone isn't currently built to be a TCG so shouldn't be compared to one.
Its a really fun game! 

Things to know before you get it though, you start the game with 10 packs and 2 decks and unless you either buy packs or buy from the market you arent getting any more cards. Putting together a deck for constructed will usually cost less than 5 dollars unless you want some key cards like axe, drow, or annihilation. Non-Keeper draft is free though. Right now they have a group of 5 decks that you can try out for free, though it says that is temporary so I dont know what they are going to do after they expire.
Fun game with interesting mechanics and plenty of strategies to experiment with. If you like the complexity of MTG, the lore of Dota, a MOBA turned into a card game, and ( in the game's current state) don't mind spending some cash to get some cards, then this game is for you. 

Yes the game is $20. But you get 10 packs when you start the game ( which is about $20.00). So yes, you got forced into a microtransaction. If the game did not give me anything when I started I think the $20 price tag would be unfair. 

As far as purchasing cards, I don't see the issue. I think paying $20 for Axe/Drow Ranger (popular/strong cards right now) is nothing compared to other card games. Many cards in MTG (regardless of which format you play) are $50+ and you need four copies of each (Many of which are lands aka mana). HS requires you to open packs for a chance of getting what you need and offers poor return on the cards you dust. Although I'm not well versed on HS's arena system, I have talked to others who find that it fulfills the F2P aspect of the game.
 
I like that this game has a market. I have had my fair share of Hearthstone and sometimes you wish you could buy the card rather than open booster packs. Although, similar to MTG, this game is also vulnerable to price inflation of cards. It may be a $20 card now but Axe could rise up to $300 right up there with Jace the Mind Sculptor (MTG) in a couple months. The game could also use a better "dusting" system. Meat grinding tons of extra copies into one event ticket does not appear to give much return. If they keep the current business model in action, I would hope they provide some better returns when ridding extra copies.

I will say that this game does need a more practical way for F2P players, and maybe even players who spend money from time to time, to succeed. As of now the F2P aspect is not looking good and is not well received, as one can tell from many of these steam reviews. I don't have a solution, but Valve may need to find one quickly if they want to turn some frowns upside down. 

7/10 as of now
Stop the RNG. Let us displace a hero where we want, put creeps where we want. Stop all the randomized bullshit. It is a fucking amazing game, if it wasn't for the "Randomness" of everything. Love the game but come on. Even MTG lets you target shit and declare blockers, hold priority and all other shit like that.
Very well done game and mechanics, way over any other card game.
The money problem isn't one, you can play drafts and drafts tournaments for free with prizes to win.
Just get good.  :D
I like it. Business model seems misrepresented since you can earn packs and tickets if you do well in expert without having to pay after the initial purchase. Business model aside, I enjoy it a lot. There's a lot of moving parts that keep you on your toes. Very accessible from the beginning still though.
I like it, people only give it negative reviews because they are used to Hearthstone where you can grind to earn packs. This game is better on all levels compared to Hearthstone.
Pay a small amount to build a decent deck or waste your life away trying to grind pack/rely on RNG to get the card you need. I'll take the first option.
Artifact has such a huge potential, yet it is being wasted right now. I've played Hearthstone for a few months and of course I have to compare these two games, even though Artifact's aim was to be different. I have to say that Artifact is different - playing on 3 lanes, hero deployment, and so on. Amazing ideas. As a Dota player I love it. But what Artifact lacks is some award system or something like that. I want to see some progress bar, get a card or something... I want to see how many games I've played and how many I've won. All you get is "Victory". Well thank you, Valve. 

Rework it, otherwise this is gonna be a huge fail...

23. 12. UPDATE:
After the 21. 12. patch Artifact is what it ought to be the day Valve released it. Finally some progress bars, finally some appreciation of one's skill. Finally you can earn some packs and event tickets just by playing. 
Buying cards is still a necessity, but since they reworked (mainly debuffed) some cards like Axe and Drow, cards aren't that expensive in my opinion.

Worth of playing!
A unique fusion of the basic trading card game formula and some board game mechanics, with a hint of MOBA tactics (via the hero/item systems). The UI can be a little overwhelming at first, but all the information on the screen is relevant, and it doesn't take too long to get used to.
A card game with a lot of depth. Still learning and I feel like I suck but the draft modes are very fun. Constructed I haven't spent as much time in but I have built one really cool deck that seems to beat 75% of the decks it comes accross but then gets destroyed in the wrong match up.
Amazing game with a really high skill cap and steep learning curve.  
My favorite game mode is casual phantom draft, which does not cost anything more than the 20.

Very fun with satisfying strategic depth once you learn the ropes. Have been playing casual draft and event mode and dueling friends without breaking out the credit card. There's no need to spend additional money to enjoy the game, contrary to all the negative reviews flying around.
It's a digital trading card game. The 'game price' is the price of 10 boosters.
For what it is, it is great. Highly strategic and not as much RNG as in hearthstone.
Fantastic game with a great pricing model when compared to other card games such as Magic: the Gathering and Yu-Gi-Oh. I have spent hundreds of dollars for a tier 1 deck in other card games whereas the current top deck in Artifact costs roughly $60. If you know what you are getting into, this is a great game to play.
Really interesting and deep strategy, a great trading card game. Not pay to win at all, you get a very fair amount of stuff for the entrance price and it's quite easy to win new cards.  I think the majority of the negative reviewers forgot that this is a trading card game and not call of duty. Good luck doing well in magic the gathering or even Hearthstone with just the intro decks. The majority of cards are like 1-10p on the market place and you are free to sell cards you have that you don't want to get ones you do ( The exception being Axe, which i assume is because of some snidey marketplace manipulation).

In all it's a great card game that adds a lot to Dota lore and you get a fair amount of packs,cards and tickets for the entrance price. Spend a little extra and build a decent deck and you'l be earning cards in no time, not that you need to as you can always use the event decks and have a great time
This is the game with the most instances of the word 'random' I have ever seen.

Despite having great mechanics, you never really have control over anything since everything has a huge dose of random, it will either do something you want or kill you, 50/50.
just do what I did, bought the game and opened my 10 packs, sold all the rares and good cards for 15$~ and the cards that are so cheap I used them to get tickets, got 15 tickets! so you can say I bought this game for almost free.

now what do I think of the game? GREAT GAME. there is a lot of FREE modes you can play in this game and I am enjoying myself so much.
One of the best digital cardgames I've played - actually has a similar play feel to netrunner. As long as they keep the casual phantom draft free entry, I think it probably also has the least exploitative monetisation I've seen in the genre also.


People griping about the monetization don't realize it's cheaper in the long run than the other models of just buying packs. It isn't built to satisfy f2p'ers. It's built to satisfy the people in the middle who pay to play, but can't pay enough to get everything. This way yuou can just pay for the specific deck you want and be done. No lootbox required.


Also the game is very in depth and complex. Probably too much for a lot of people. You will be bad for many hours. Games also play at a slower pace than mtga/hs. These are all preferences though.
Don't worry the 20$ price tag, cause it offers much better value than some other TCG that tag as Free but you have to pay much later on to catch up with the meta
You get what you pay for. An interesting game that is lots of fun. Entry price, plus a small investment of 10 bucks, gave me enough cards for some decent enough decks. Any extra cards, you can pick up for very little (cents). 

If you want freebies and are too cheap, this is not for you.
The game is interesting. Quite a bit of new mechanics that I have not seen in other card games. I love Dota and most of the heroes are interesting. Looks like they added the ability to earn cards. Hopefully they increase this even more. Also they gave up on the "not balancing cards", those were two of my main worries. Glad valve fixed these mistakes and look forward to playing more.
As a long time HS player I have to admit, Artifact outclasses Hearthstone is most ways. Will it take over HS though, probably not. The costing I don't think is that big of an issue, the main problem is the lack of competitive ladder. Sure the expert modes are fun but there is no clear progression or feeling of getting anywhere. This is what attracted me to HS and the reason why I loved it. Not having this on Artifact will cause a lot of people to lose interest quickly which is a shame.
Nice game, totally worth its price.
Has a good depth without being too complicated to learn.
Nice draft system, ranked mode also announced, overall very good game.
The $30 price tag covers the 10 "free" booster packs you get ingame. If you think of this game like  CCG you will not be happy, if you view it for what it is, a TCG (MTG,Yugioh etc) then you'll know what you're getting yourself into.

With the 10 free packs I received "Axe" the most expensive card which at the time was ~$23, sold it bought 10 more packs spending $7 more and got 3 axes in those 10 packs. The game's more than paid for itself. If you're willing to invest in a TCG this is a solid choice.

If you prefer CCGs, try hearthstone but if you want to stay competitive in a game like that you'll end up spending hundreds more.
I highly recommend you this game if you like card games. Definitely better than Hearthstone and other card games because:
1. The random is 'balanced' (random is not the main reason of your loss or victory)
2. There is a timer in game (adds more time on the next round and you can lose after the timer expires)
3. Three lanes to play with (a lot of interesting strategies and moves to make)
These 3 points in my opinion makes Artifact better than every other card game. 
Remember: This is my own opinion and you may not like the game the same as me. 
Hope this review will help you
Artifact is an incredibly deep and unique cardgame with a focus on strategy. The rest of this review is gonna be about the economy, because that's what most people reading these reviews probably actually care about.

As every single other review has already told you, there is no free way to grind cards, so if you're planning to play constructed outside of events, you're probably gonna have to pay up a bit more than just the games base price. Draft costs nothing though, so if that's what you're here for, I can absolutely recommend Artifact.

And for those that are planning to put money into getting into constructed, Artifact offers solid value for money compared to many competitors. Each pack includes 12 cards, including at least 1 of the highest rarity, and you can buy cards missing from your deck from the steam market instead of trying to get them off a pack. Generally common cards only cost around 0.05€, but the most popular heroes/rares go for much higher prices (Axe, the most expensive one, is currently around 10€).
Artifact is a game that revolves around hero synergy and knowing where your enemy might position there heroes, this maybe hard to look at for newer players but getting a win by luck or mastery of the game is really satisfying to reach that -200 to a single tower and your enemy surrenders willingly
I was only interested on casual draft games so I sold all my cards and got 28€ back. So I basically got paid 10€ for getting the game. Pretty good deal.
A very good card game from Valve.
There are a lot of RNG in the game, but there are so much more variables that you can control that the better player will win most of the time.
To win each game, it usually requires you to plan ahead and predict your opponent's moves. The game also go back and forth constantly, without any clear winner from the start.
Gameplay wise the game is very good. Monetization wise, it seems bad a first, but I believe it's still fair. What can change this is how future card sets and rotation will be dealt with.
What seemed like a daunting game much like Dota2, turned out to be a intuitive and charming gaming expirience. Yet it lacks some sort of progression system but it does make up for it in the quality of the content; Fully voiced descriptions and banter between cards as you play are just few of the little touches that make this TCG stand out among its competitors.

Pros:
+ The 3 lane system is interesting and adds much depth to strategic decisions
+ the Art is true to its dota origin and well done
+ Heroes come with autoinclude cards adding to the each own uniqueness
+ the Hero cards actually talk to their enemies/allies making the game feel alive.

Mixed:
-+ It has the same business model as MTGZ
-+ It expands on Dota 2 lore .
-+ the game nails the Dota 2 feel down to the lanes and towers
-+ Seems to be mostly A draft game so far
-+ A bit of RNG

Cons:
-no progression system
-some UI problems 
-No chat or much of a social support
Love this game! One of the best digital card games i've played. 

Really well done, the animations are fantastic and the unique gameplay is so much fun.
Every time Valve releases a game, it's not the game we thought we wanted, that's for sure, but we can also be sure that it will be a well crafted game with the best gameplay.
Artifact brings to the TCG/CCG scene a new type of game, no your usual casual-grabbing game, but a complex game with deep mechanics and an interactive gameplay.
Gabe promised this would be the ""Half Life of card games", to that I can only say "mission accomplished."


The game is good and with more cards it's going to be the best digital card game on the market for those the prefair a card that is not based ouround the casual playerbase. Personaly I prefair the draft mode with has an option to play for free forever with all the cards in the set so in some ways its very fair since in compation 20 dollar in Heartstone or Gwent gets you nowhere. In adition when you spend money you can spend it on the steam marketplace to taget purchase what you need and therefore 10 dollars here compaired to the other mentioned games is way more valuable. 

The game is cheep from a tradable card game perespctive and the prices drop every day. The game is probably expensive compaired to the current free to play based standards that exist in the industry where many players can play the game without paying a single dollar and let the ones who can and want to do it for them and it's this crown that stand for most of the negative reviews. In some ways this is another kind of game, a game for traditional games gamers or maybe a more card game based crowd since in compations to almost all physical games games out there Artifact is very cheep.
IMO, the most complex and [b] FUN [/b] Digital TCG to date. The only reason it has mixed reviews is because people are whining that the game costs money...go figure. In all seriousness, the monetization is done very well, you're able to buy and sell specific cards on Steam's market place and if you do decide to buy packs, you get a good amount for your buck. If you're worried about the money and you're familiar with the price of other Digital TCGs or real world TCGs, know that this game is cheaper.
if you've played another other card game youre gonna love this economy, tier 1 decks are dirt cheap and if you practice draft you can easily go infinte.
I highly recommend this game if you like card games at all.

Review Edit: It's now on Day 5 of the game, and I've finally gotten a few 5 win runs, and have made close to 60 dollars by only playing expert draft right now...your mileage may vary though obviously.

tl;dr: Economy is actually set up really well for those who've played any other card game ever, or even recent games of almost any kind. Those complaining likely jumped right into the events without understanding game mechanics and lost all their tickets to beta players.

To address everyone complaining about the economy model: it was designed by the same guy who did a lot of Magic The Gathering, what did you really expect?

Currently by using the Steam Marketplace you can "buy" an event ticket for ~70-80 cents by buying 20 cheap cards and recycling them, rather than the $1.99. I wouldn't really recommend using your event tickets until you're comfortable with the game mechanics though.

In this draft mode you can play for free using casual and its just as fun. With the event tickets, your event is done after 2 losses, but you get your ticket back after 3 wins, you get a pack of cards after 4 wins, and 2 packs of cards after 5 wins. Even without a single 5 win run so far on event runs, I have "made" money playing Artifact so far, as I'm sitting at 21 event tickets currently (I bought cheap cards to recycle), and have sold cards out of my packs. If I hadn't "bought" more event tickets, I'd have 4 event tickets left and per my steam market history, I would've made $6 dollars for a game I'm thoroughly enjoying so far.

If what you want to play is constructed decks similar to normal MTG or even Hearthstone, to build a top tier super competitive deck right now on the Market would likely run about $75-100, most of which would be spent on a few big cost cards (Axe is currently running about $25 himself). I'm sure this price will go down as time goes on, because there will be more people like me essentially "trading" cheap cards for tickets, then using the tickets to get card packs.
Despite the outcry over the monetization I got the game and a top tier deck for $30. It took $20 and a few hundred hours of my time to get half as far in Hearthstone.
this game is like really different and actually pretty fun compared to other trading card games
I do think the price is too much.
also yo i'd rather buy cards that i WANT than buying card packs with random chance
This game is closer to MTG than Hearthstone, but not too similar to either one of them. The game mode to play in this game is phantom draft where you pick cards from packs to make a deck and use it in a little tournament, but you don't keep the cards at the end. This mode has access to all the cards and you can play it forever and ever without spending any additional dollars. You can elect to spend money on the mode, keep the cards, and bet on yourself to get additional prizes.

I do think they need to tinker with prize support though. It FEELS a little on the stingy side.

In comparison to MTG this game is cheap as hell.
Fun gameplay, a fresh approach to a card game.  Long term could suffer from a semi-greedy approach to tickets and card collecting.  Worth a try, Valve will cave and give a way to accrue in game currency.
Looks like it will be cheap overall but people should wait until market prices settle before buying anything expensive. Gameplay is great and for your 20 you have infinite inhouse drafts which iws well worth the buy in.
As somebody who as never played a card game before I find this extremely challenging but also insanely fun. I have so many close games and comebacks from both sides, so I never feel completely comfortable with my lead, but I also never feel completely out of it. It took me a little time learn most of the cards and mechanics, along with how modes like draft work. The begining tutorial does a good job of teaching you how the game is played. The main mark against the overal product is they don't have a tutorial for draft modes, so if you havent done something like that mode before it took me a few tries of just doing it to figure out what was going on.

Also there is plenty of free content and ability to build decently competitve decks off the starting cards and packs. The competitive mode which gives card rewards costs $1 tickets, but people who are serious about playing the game competively should expect spending on some investment, especially considering good players can ultimately make money off the card rewards if they play well.

For people like me who only want to play for fun there are casual constructed and draft modes for free that everybody seems to overlook while they complain. Still havent spent any money outside the initial $20 and I am starting to win a lot more now that I'm understanding some of the strategies better.
Great card game, particularly for anyone already familiar with the DOTA context.  Satisfyingly close matches and a great deal of flexibility and strategy are contained within the game framework.  Much more crunchy than Hearthstone and similar competitors -- the focus is on the mechanics rather than a few select cards or deck builds.  Reminds me very much of the early years of Magic which should probably be no surprise.
While the business model is not to some people's tastes, I have minimal issue with it - Been thouroughly enjoying playing casual and expert draft games, with casual requiring no additional payment to play and expert costing a ticket to enter (ticket costs $5 for 5, you get 5 for free when purchasing the game, can earn tickets/packs as prizes by winning 3+ matches in a draft).

This game is engaging, huge potential for back and forth, numerous times I've thought I was in a clear upper hand position then to be surprised. Came to this game from Hearthstone which I had been playing for several years (since Blackrock expansion), Artifact is an exciting and refreshing experience.

Lastly
VALVE WAS VERY DIRECT AND UPFRONT ABOUT THE MONETIZATION AND YET YOU STILL COMPLAIN.
Additionally, if you use your smarts you can get the fun/competitive/whatnot decks you want to use in artifact for much, much cheaper than Hearthstone, on average.
It's a well designed card game, and I have no problem with the way it is monetized.

I like the inclusion of prebuilt decks. Unlike the ones in Hearthstone, these actually seem to be playable - at least against each other.

However, my issue is the fact that there is no sense of progression or accomplishment for playing the non extra-paid modes. There is no ladder to climb, and no rewards of any kind. I wouldn't expect free packs or cards, the way the marketplace is designed (and that's fine), but maybe some sort of customization rewards would be nice. Board designs, card backs, sound effects, new critters, shiny non-sellable versions of cards, anything.

Instead, you play some games, win or lose them, and that's it.

I may update this review after using my tickets, but I don't want to do that until I get better at the game.
It's everything I ever wanted in a card game. People complain about the monetization but I've found it to be cheaper to acquire cards than MTG or even Hearthstone for a full collection, not to mention the integration with the Steam Marketplace.
Let me first state that I love this game.

I grew up playing all sorts of CCG, from MTG to Pokemon and even played Legend of the Five Rings. Each game was different in their own way, but each also required a hefty investment in order to start playing. I understand that most reviewers gripes are concerning the upfront cost of playing the game but consider that this is the only card game that I know of where the cards have actually monetary value, as opposed to others like HS. If you expect to play at high ranks in constructed, expect to pay up. Otherwise, enjoy a free phantom draft mode and the opportunity to earn packs through good play (and good luck).

The game is beautiful, well produced, and makes the game seem much more alive than cards on a table. Valve was able to pack so much information into a reason and make it relatively accessible and understandable. There are certainly some things to work on but I have known Valve to be prompt and accurate when it comes to patches.

The gameplay is really what draws my attention. The game feels like a combination of MTG, HS, and has a layout similar to Gwent, but plays so darn differently that it makes everything fresh and exciting. I can't wait to see what further expansions or additions add to the game.
This is closer to paper Magic the Gathering than Hearthstone or MTG Arena but with trading and a marketplace the cards have real world value and you can always cash out if you quit playing.
i've had some of the most epic experiences playing this game that i've had in almost any game.  it's ridiculously entertaining and egaging for a card game.  the base set is fairly basic but this already provides the skeleton for what could be the best card game i've played.  the economy is the economy.  it's not f2p but there are currently plenty of f2p options including free fantom draft.  that being said i feel like the business model is the most fair of the games that i've played (hearthstone, mtg arena, and gwent (i've heard faeria has a really sweet deal but i dunno)). you're missing out if you don't pick this one up.
I'm writing this on Nov 30, 2018, two days after launch. I've currently got 22 hours logged (I took Friday off).

As someone who played Magic the Gathering from 2010-2015, and eventually gave it up because it became too expensive, Artifact is exactly what I've been yearning for since. I've tried a  multitude of digital card games (Hex, Gwent, Hearthstone, Duelyst, Might and Magic, etc, etc), and with the exception of a Hex, I had dropped all of them within a week because despite how "generous" these games supposedly were. Most become a chore due to having to grind matches, or do dailies, or "dust" cards. All I've wanted is a solid game where I could buy what I want directly since I value my time over any disposable income...and Artifact fits the bill perfectly. 

The Pros
It's the best looking card game on the market
The music is top tier 
Most if not all the cards have voice acting with releveant lore.
The game itself heavily involves rng, but is balanced enough that you can dig yourself out of almost any situtation.
Buying and selling cards is easy and fast
In game tournament support.
Free casual drafting.

The  Cons
You can't go infinite through draft or casual alone. As a result you either have to sell cards (which to be fair, is as easy as it could be) or pay money.
No colorblind mode. I'm not colorblind myself, but I have friends who are.

Given all the quality of life features the game lauched with and Valve's history with supporting their games, I am very excited to see this game grow and improve even further

As a long time Hearthstone player, I can tell you this game is soooo much cheaper than Hearthstone. If monitization of this game justified this amount of public outcry, Blizzard should go to the hell of hells. You want to grind for cards in Hearthstone that is not even fun anymore, be my guest. Grind your life away or spend 2 dollars for 5 useless cards 99% of the time. The card game genre need a truely skillful game, and this game has the potential to be one. I am just so sick and tired of the braindead random chaos that which is Hearthstone.

Make the switch, or enter the digital card genre with Artifect, you won't regret it.
Overall, a fantastic game. It's a remarkable well-made & complex game that is always challenging & interesting. 

The payment model, while a radical departure from the free to play & pay to win blight that we currently live under, is so far a pretty fantastic decision. It helps to make decks accessible while also avoiding the exploitative practices of other f2p games. It's all in all a great game. Highly recommend.
I really like the game! There are tons of RNG that can be very frustrating but an equal ton of decisions to make it fun. I wish the RNG was tuned down a bit but even with it this is the best digital card gaming experience out there.
Buying Artifact: -$20 USD
Selling rares opened from packs: +$25
Buying full collection of commons: -$4

I literally earned money buying this game to play "Pauper" (no rares or uncommons) and Draft.

YMMV
Amazing card game, don't really get all the whining about slow, boring grind and monotonous quests for keeping the game free. Money is well worth getting a clean and complex experience with what is probably ithe best card game on the market.
Haven't enjoyed a card game as much as this before. Draft mode is my favorite mode and requires no further $$ after the initial purchase. By far the most affordable CCG if you plan on playing constructed competitively. 

If you're looking for mobile-game style progression and grinding Hearthstone may be a better option.
This game appeals deeply to my love for CCGs.  There are a lot of novel mechanics here that are incredibly thematic, and a few things borrowed from magic that are missing from hearthstone (like simultaneous combat).  It does not however have a "stack" or reactive mechanics, which are responsible for MTG being one of the deepest strategy games ever created.

Regardless, It's better in just about every way from Hearthstone and if that's the itch you are looking to scratch this game is perfect.  It can feel a bit busy sometimes with esentially three separate board states at any given time, but ultimately you get acclimated and it enhances the strategy.  There is a neat back and forth of pressuring and testing your enemies defenses before ultimately you give up on one of your lanes and race your opponent to victory.  Just like the MOBA I know and love.  Hereoes acting as essentially upgradable EDH commanders is pretty cool and I really like the way it dictates the boardstate. 

If I were to levy any complaint against the card design it's that the current set feels very light on strategies that manipulate looting or filtering mechanics, a staple for most CCGs.

The monetization scheme does not bother me at all, it's beyond fair for a CCG, especially since you can also buy/sell cards on the marketplace.  You start with 10 free packs and a constructed deck is only like 20 bucks max at the moment.  You can do phantom drafts or casual constructed play without any prizes to your hearts content without spending a dime after the initial purchase.  It only costs money when you play for prizes.  I kind of despise that this game is getting reviewed bombed by the children out there who don't have a bank account and so they can't play, but such is the nature of the internet.

Overall 8/10, potential 10/10 if future sets evolve the game mechanics and strategy.
Let's get this out of the way: This game is absolutely worth $20. It is amazingly polished and there are tons of ways to play with ALL the cards in the game after having only spent your initial $20. 

Having said that: Because this is a card game based on collecting cards, you'll need to spend money if you feel the need to "complete your collection". This would make it possible to play "constructed". As I stated earlier though, you don't need to have a complete collection in order to play with ALL cards in the game. You can play the draft format for FREE without ever spending a single cent.

There are tons of ways to have fun playing this game without ever spending any more than your initial $20. If you like card games though, this is a phenomenal game. The ability to simply buy single cards from the steam market makes it possible to buy the exact deck you want to play with. Again though, that's only necessary if you want to play constructed. If you want to play a draft format, you can do that for FREE infinitely.
In the last two days I spent every minute of my free time playing Artifact. I already have 17 hours and have started carrying my laptop to university so I can play between the study breaks (although it turned out to be the other way around). Please don't buy this game, it is already too late for me. Save yourselves. Run. Run, you fools.
An exceptionally good card game. Like every other card game on planet Earth, if you want the full game experience, you will spend additional money on packs/content.
The most expensive card is Axe by far. at the time of writing this review, he costs $20 USD about. the 2nd most expensive is Drow, which is around 12- 15, then kanna which is around 9 - 10, and maybe literally 3 or 4 cards around the 5 dollar mark, and a few in the 2 dollar zone, and like 90% of cards in the 0.05 cents to 0.50 area. 

people complain about not being able to grind cards, but grinding cards opens you up for bots and farmers to grind out cards to sell for steam cash, and that would totally ruin the market, no cards would hold their value.

of course as the game reaches it's peak in terms of player base, and each player coming in with 10 packs, that is a whole lot of card to potentially be on marketplace to drive down prices. 

the game also has a 100% free game mode, casual phantom draft. you have much more choice in this mode than the draft in hearthstone, and its free. 

this game feels less punishing if you make a mistake because you can always change how much priority you are giving each lane.

it feels less bad to loose because in the end, unless you are playing with tickets, you are playing for fun. even if you lose the game, if it was close and you had fun testing your skill and fate, you still won if you enjoyed the game. 

people talking smak about no grinding cards, and no ladder probably don't know what they are talking about. remember when you played a game because the game was fun? not because it gave you a false sense of progress that actually has 0 value IRL?
This is by far the best card game I have ever played. From the deep strategies, to the fun of playing with the market, to the buttery smooth mechanics - this game has the making of a truly "gamebreaking" game. The only issue thus far is progression, which Valve has confirmed as their top priority. Can't wait to see what else they have in store, but for now, I'm thrilled to continue to find new strategies to win! 

People can complain about the $20 price tag all they want, but the fact of the matter is that Valve knows how to make a game the right way. If you've ever been into card games at all, I strongly suggest this beautifully crafted game.

EDIT: Now updated with much needed balance changes and a fantastic progression system, I am fully committed to this game, and I suggest you hop on the train now before you fall way behind the curve. This game is only going to gain momentum from here.
People complaining about the monetization model clearly know nothing about how normal card games function, and are spoiled by Hearthstone's grind-heavy model. The way that Valve has structured this game allows for a community market to exist, putting cards at rock-bottom prices in the long term. You can already recycle cards for event tickets at a surprisingly good rate, so I'm not sure why people are complaining about being forced to pay for tickets, since this is not the case. The only reason complaints would be warranted would be to coerce valve into giving away event tickets, perhaps on some kind of weekly timer. But these are not the reasonable options people are demanding, so you should just ignore them.

Overall, a shockingly good debut for a very complex card game that always offers more. I have never been so impressed with a card game.
Actually enjoyable game! If you are smart enough you can build budgety decks and play on a good level. It's a cards game, what did you expect? That you will own all of the cards? That would be hearthstone all over again.
A very good card game with unique mechanics. The decision space of this game is insane. While there is some rng involved, it is primarily frontloaded (bar a few examples like cheating death). So far this has not been frustrating, its just another aspect of the game you have to consider. Initiative creates a great dynamic of play now vs act first later. 

In terms of the market, it is unfortunate that the game doesn't allow you to earn much for free. However, I much prefer this model to something like Hearthstone, where missing a week of play amounts to missing out on potential value from quests. When I played hearthstone, I eventually realized I was playing for quests and not because I enjoyed it, and Artifact avoids that issue. While rares like Axe may be absurdly expensive, a full playset of non-rare cards will only set you back ~100, which is far cheaper than you can say for other card games. While the monetization may not be aimed at the casual, its not unfair to them either.

The game is not perfect, but its not terrible game people are selling it to be. The game is already super fun (my favorite digital card game) and future sets are likely to improve it given valve's track record with communitiy feedback.
After a while you WILL run into the same deck over and over again. Game is clearly pay to win, with a lot of cards clearly being better than others. If you can't pay the £17.00 for axe, you're already at a disadvantage. 

However, that just makes it 10x better when you watch someone rage quit after spending £40 on their deck when you defeat them xD.
Despite being complex and money dependant, it is very rewarding and fun to play. If you arent happy about p2w then stop playing it is a card game ffs.
this game is actually good if you're willing to PAY,but i guess it ok if you have some money for the card packs.btw they are cheaper than those yugioh or magic cards.
I won't recommend it if you're not going to spend more other than the game itself since it only gives you 10 card pack + a starter deck,it's not enough to make your own deck.
And for that 1 month dota + thing,i must say i am not interested in it so i can't say much about that(i know what it is,i played dota for years).maybe would be better if GabeN change it to more card pack.
This is the best card games I have ever played.  I love how many choices their are to make in the game.  This makes it feel like if you win or lose is always in your control.  If you are looking for a card game to pour a lot of hours into, this is it.
Very cool and intricate card game. Not really pay-to-win as people say. There are casual draft modes which are totally free, and "expert" draft modes which require an event ticket to enter. You get 5 of these for free initially. With that, it's really win-to-play.
Great fresh take on the old card game formula. The integration of Dota elements was done really seamlessly and makes this card game unique. Sure, packs cost money, but you can buy and sell your cards on the Steam marketplace and being able to build a highly competitive deck for $50 is unheard of in MTGO/A or without grinding for hours in Hearthstone. The cost of the game basically pays for the 10 $1.99 packs you receive for "free" after you finish the tutorial which I actually understand since the cards you receive from those packs are immediately marketable, not to mention that casual phantom drafts are completely free.
Fun with decent depth. Some RNG elements are a bit off putting, but most can be played around or accounted for. I like the voice acting and enjoy the marketplace.
It's a very challgenging and great card game. If you are willing to put in some time to get used to game it is fun. And don't listen to all the people claiming that you have spend a shitload of money to have fun with this game, that's just utter garbage. I haven't spent a dime and don't plan to spend much in the future and I've had a blast so far and don't see how this is gonna change anytime soon. To be honest the draft / limited game mode is far more fun than constructed anyways and you can play it for free. Or you are in for a more competitive environment and want to have something on  the line you have to spend a whooping dollar per draft after the first one if you don't manage to win at least 3 games in of your first drafts which are free.
So what we have here a card game from valve with dota world and so many mode to play looks good

Edited: need a new path for dayli quest and ranking system
*You win Gaben, now take our hard-earned $$$ and start releasing some new games we've all been patiently waiting for. 

Artifact will be my first ever TCG I have ever played in the 13+ years I've been gaming on Steam. I have done extensive research as to the model of the game and the fact that this game has been criticized as a PAY2PLAY2WIN model but I decided to give it a shot anyways since I enjoy playing all types of genres. At the moment, I don't plan to pay more than I already had for the base game though that could possibly change in the future. 

That being said, I really didn't think that the Pay2Win aspect seen in Artifact would have such a huge impact on the gameplay compared to MTG, especially for brand new players. Well, from my very first and only 6 games so far, every single player had Axe (most expensive card) and upon analyzing their deck post-game to try and improve mine, I realized a lot of their cards were ones that cost significantly more than the 0.01-0.10EUR common cards. Maybe I'm just bad and unfamiliar with TCGs but if you're a newbie like me, losing to players because they spent more money on a synergized deck will become a common occurence. I will keep playing in small doses to hopefully get better and enjoy it more, but in the meantime, it doesn't appeal to me and I'm not having fun especially since I don't plan on buying new cards that could otherwise improve my deck.

Overall, the game is beautifully designed and seems really clean and well-defined (visual animations, audio, text). I did have some issues hovering my mouse over some underlined text on card descriptions to try and read what certain terms meant but the text box kept dissapearing (super annoying for a someone trying to learn the game).

If you're okay spending $$$ over the course of playing this game as new cards are released and enjoy a beautifully, refined-TCG, than I recommend. 
If you're not okay and a bit butthurt spending money on a TCG and would rather pay 80$ for an EA title just because it's 2020 in 2019 or if you prefer canvas over nylon, than I wouldn't recommend.
Yes, its a card game and shit costs money... However, much fun can be had with only playing the free event modes and if you choose to buy cards or packs, the game is much fairer that other games on the market. Uniquie fun and complex gameplay  make artifact a great game overall assuming you're not one to complain about the monitization model that was public before it launched.
Artifact is fun, and only costs $20. Sure, the fact that you need to pay to play competitive, and you need to spend money to open packs of random cards is a bit jarring. But the fact is that you only need to spend if you want to OWN those cards in your permanent collection. You can still play with new cards in other game modes. 

For example, I got a ton of cards from the starting packs you get for the $20 you pay. I can make several decks with those cards already. Plus I started the constructed event which lets you play with pre-made decks. I do not OWN most of the cards in the pre-made decks, but I can still play with them during the event.

So you do get variety from the game, even without buying packs. Already I'm having more fun with $20 I spent on Artifact, than I have with other card games that require more money to even own enough cards to stay competitive.

About the gameplay, there's a fair amount of randomness here and there. For example when a hero enters play you can choose what lane it goes in, but not the position within that lane, and you can't choose where the automatic melee creeps go. There are cards that let you change position or target, but you can't remove that randomness entirely.  Perhaps, the choice was because having to make so many decisions for each unit and 3 lanes would slow the game down too much.

Since you can mulligan the cards, sometimes you may not have any cards to play in a lane. Or perhaps your hero is killed or silenced in the action phase and you can't play any cards in that lane. There are several of these minor frustrating moments, but there are also combos and strategies either building a deck or playing cards. It's fun to create a new deck, and it's fun to play with the preconstructed decks.

Now one criticism is that the game does not really explain much of anything. I had to go on a wiki to learn basics such as "what does this keyword mean", or "what does the hold button in the shop does". The in-game explanations aren't always clear. I was staring at the Stonehall items wondering what they meant - did they increase stats every turn, or did they lose stats every turn? Another criticism is that I still am not quite sure how all the game modes work. I hesitated at first to start the current pre-constructed event because I wasn't sure whether I had to pay one event ticket (you get 5 when you start, others cost extra). I'm still not sure how this event works. If I rack up losses does that mean I can't play the event anymore? or can I start again with a different deck? There's no excuse for me having to wonder at this. Why can't it be explained clearly in so many words. The game is so new that you can't find answers to your questions just by going on google.

In the end, Artifact is worth it even just for $20, regardless of the slightly jarring monetization scheme to add new cards to your permanent collection. In a way, it lets you play with new cards more than, say, Hearthstone. I've stopped playing Hearthstone years ago, but I remember that there was no way for me to play with some fancy rare-based deck unless I was lucky enough to draw enough cards to build it. In Artifact, I feel like I at least get to play new decks even if I don't permanently own those cards.
This game is so far my favorite online card game. The pay model totally makes sense as a card game and the gameplay is fantastic fun. I cant wait to see this evolve into something bigger and better.

- The people complaining about the cost really don't understand how card games work nor do they like card games. This product is getting review bombed by pack mentality kids that don't even want to play the game in general.
EDIT2: With progression now added, my biggest gripe is now gone, and I can recommend the game : )

---------------

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: I don't recommend in the current state. Without ways to expand your collection by playing, there is no real motivation to play.

EDIT: 
I realized that I'm not a player that Valve thinks I am. I don't play card games for winning with other players, I play them mostly for the fun on building decks, exploring new possibilities, and progressing with the collection, so winning is just a means to do this. The way Artifact is currently constructed, it only caters to those that are fond of winning for winning's sake. All the things that make a card game for me (building, expanding, progressing, exploring) are removed and condensed to a single thing - a monetary transaction.

As it is currently constructed, there is nothing in Artifact for me. It's not even that the game is too expensive. It's more that 'winning progression' is what's fun in my case. You make that purchase only and you remove that fun. 

Which is a shame, because everything except that is top-notch in the game.
Best card game I've played, much more complex than Gwent or Hearthstone, if you don't want to pay and take part in the card trading aspect you can just play free draft, if you buy some cards and get into competitive you can buy some cheap tickets and get a chance at winning it back + some free packs, great system imo.
For people that are not interested in playing construced this game is almost F2P. I opened my 10 packs and sold all my reasonably expensive cards and almost broke even. So i bought this game for $2 and I have tons of cheap cards to buy tickets. Tickets are dirt cheap too! Currently you can buy one for 45 cents by buying cheapest 20 cards from the market.

F2P casual phantom draft to practice your skills and after you got gud you can enter a Gauntlet for 45 cents! If you are above average you will get all cards for constructed for free!
So far I'm very impressed with this game.  Others are complaining about how expensive it is, but if you really look at it closely it's not.  This is the only TCG I'm aware of that lets you draft for FREE.  Free phantom drafts is amazing and makes it more than worth the $20 for the game.  You can also play the gauntlet decks for free, and play against your friends for free.  

Not sure what all the fuss is about, this is the kind of monetization I want from a card game, not the endless boring grind to get a few free packs. Two thumbs up!
The game is quite good, a unique card game, other reviews say the game is difficult but it's not really, you just have to keep in mind there is three boards instead of one but it seems like it's missing a few things, a ranking system being one and it is not generous at all as far as card collecting goes.

If you like draft format this game is great, you can do it for free (After buying the game of course - also if you want to play draft where you keep the cards you need to use tickets AND card packs and I'm sure most people playing will just pick the most valuable cards first), constructed decks on the other hand you have to pay to get the good cards, the starting decks aren't great and there is no way to get cards for free after you use your initial card packs and tickets.

The elephant in the room is the market place, most cards are cheap (£0.05 - £0.15)  but the best cards go for around £10 - £25 depending on what trading shenanigans are going on (At the time of writing this review 30 - 11 - 2018), there really aren't very many of those but most players seem to think they are nessesary cards for best meta decks,  there is the worry of how will people feel if a card gets nerfed and your £25 purchase becomes worth a lot less and will that affect balance decisions in the long run?

Overall it's not too bad value for a TCG but I don't really see why the game isn't free to play, if I could give this game a neutral review I would but I'll give it a thumbs up for now since the game itself is good but the pricing structure is a bit iffy.
I usually don't write reviews but this game deserves it.

I play a lot of strategy and CCG games and this is the first in a long time that has some true innovation. Lanes, Heroes, Fountain, Shops....and so much more.

If you like strategy games stick with Artifact. It has immense depth, the ability to personalize your style of play, very good balanced gameplay with a lot of comeback mechanics. It will only get better....

I know the monetization is a major concern for people but trust Valve, they know what they are doing and they definitely know and listen to the community about the current hate for the monetization. I am sure it will change once they add Skins and Cosmetics. Its better to release a game early to get balance right than to add all the embelishments.

I am glad they made it a 20$ game so they could offset some of the evil gacha monetization tactics other free to play titles usually do. They still have to make money for now so paying for cards seems reasonable "as long as" there aren't "buy this and you win the game" cards. That is more about game design and balancing and they have some of the best designers there who will ensure it.

The things I hope to look forward to:

- Replays/Watch games in real time
- Ranked mode
- A progression system similar to Dota Plus
- Skins!!!!!
- Improved graphics

All this needs to be justified and giving them even the equivalent of 60$ to make a game as great as Dota 2 was, is fine in my honest opinion.

Overall, I am glad game design innovation like this is allowed to thrive in this day and age at companies as big as Valve.

My only negative on the game currently is how long each match goes on for....
Artifact is a card game with very complex game states. Making it feel like Dota was clearly a key design mandate, and it does this in many respects. The experience is something like playing 3 games of Hearthstone, but this undersells its high complexity and number of mechanics, something it shares with its inspiration. Fortunately, it's not as opaque as Dota, though it takes a few games to understand what's going on.

The economy is the fairest and most player-friendly I've seen in a trading card game (and if you just want to practice there are [i]FREE CASUAL PHANTOM DRAFTS[/i]), but I think there's a lot of culture shock from people who are only familiar with the online f2p grind world, and not the multi-decade history of the trading card game genre. I'm not sure what the Magic Online buy-in is right now (I think it's also $20) but given free casual phantom drafts, you clearly receive more with Artifact. There is very little friction to the economy thanks to Valve's mature community market system.

I bought this for the Richard Garfield name (hiring him was good marketing, even if some of the other marketing was botched), and I think he's done it again. (It doesn't clear the Magic bar, but there is only one summit, and as an online product it beats both online Magic products.)
Gameplay is entertaining. Unless you're willing to spend big, you're going to have to deal with the cards you receive at the end of the tutorial. Despite the game currently being a moneysink, I can imagine they'll add newer ways to receive packs over time.
Think of this game more as a traditional card game monotization, in terms of buying 2 prebuilt starter decks and then boosters or singles from a store. The only downside is no trading between friends right now but the gameplay for me is solid and fun to play.
A good game.
Mechanics are pretty different from usual card games, be aware that if you want a refund you have to NOT claim packs at the end of the tutorial, so if you don't like the game at that point you can just refund.

Playing constructed while not spending money to buy packs might be hard ( since you cannot grind cards for free ) but you can play draft mode indefinitly wihout paying a cent, though there is no reward beside fun so far. So for 20 bucks you have virtually access to all the cards through draft mode, a mode in which money spent on game gives absolutly 0 advantage.

Production is awesome, great animations, great voice lines, there's lore for every single card and they are all voice acted.
Draft mode is a bunch of fun, if you don't care about having the most optimal meta deck you can build any deck you want for sub $10.

Only card game with a secondary market. which makes commons dirt cheap.

Only thing i wish was for a way to grind out competive draft tickets, but other than that game is nearly flawless,
Yest it has micro transactions and a lot of people arent going to like it purely because of that. For me, i spent 5 extra and got about 20-25 cards i wanted from the market to make some decks. Also have spent the most time in the free phantom draft. Overall its hard to tell how valve will handle the backlash that comes with any microtransactions, i just hope they move the right direction and the backlash doesnt stall what could be a great game with a possible bright future. Because in my opinion the game is great, just bad timing to release a TCG with all the anger going around big devs nickle and diming.
No doubt the game is really really good! it is polished,it runs great, has good art(Drow Ranger by Livia Prima) and great gameplay.Unfortunately people don't the monetization, It has a system similar to the tickets in Magic the Gathering Online (not Magic Arena).

             I like the idea of buying singles and selling them, hopefully people who don't like the monetization has no problem with the Artifact Market(Buying/Selling/Trading). It feels like a real Trading Card Game and the cards you open in packs have "Value" outside of its usefulness in the game like opening Baseball Card/Sports Card Packs. Reminds me again of MTGO and Paper Magic you can buy expensive decks and sell it when you don't want or need it anymore unlike in Hearthstone where you only have the option to dust it if you don't want it anymore or if the set has rotated out. Keeper Draft is Awesome, people at my Local Game Store does this all the time at the start of every expansion its a fun way of aquiring new cards for constructed. I really feel at home as a Paper Magic The Gathering Player.


                       I do understand Artifact is a Video Game and players are not used the paywall especially since Artifact is not a F2P game. I am a bit biased because as a Paper MTG player I am used to pay entrance fees in tournaments/Drafts/Singles in real life. Maybe they can change how the ticket system works or maybe they can implement a system where players can gain ticket while playing the game, a free Ranking system may work together with Tournaments using the ticket system. Hopefully valve can Iron out or can find a way to balance Artifact as a Video Game and A Digital TCG. Again it's a great game with a lot of potential.
I like this game a lot. I wanted a digital card game that would allow me to build a decent deck without spending a fortune or all of my time. So many people are comparing this game to Hearthstone just because they're both digital card games. That's where the similarities stop. The gameplay is totally different. The business model is completely different. Everything is different. I really like the model for Artifact. I understand that it's not a good model for anyone that doesn't have their own income, but neither is Magic the gathering and nobody complains about it. I know it's a paper game but I compare it to Magic since it's the same model.

Gameplay is nice. I enjoy the mechanics a lot. It takes some getting used to though. Don't expect to just jump in and do well. You're going to have to figure out the game's nuances first. For example, you won't know just how important initiative is at first...but you will find out when they kill your blue hero in mid because they had initiative and all of a sudden you can't use that big board wipe that was going to save your tower.
*Do not be put off or dissuaded by the review bombers!*

There's really not enough good things that can be said about the quality of Artifact. Graphic and art design, music, game mechanics, strategic depth, fun factor - it's all top notch. Mechanically, Artifact is very similar to SolForge, an excellent game in its own right that never truly realized its full potential, suffering from a low budget and somewhat poor or lackluster production quality. Discerning TCG and CCG veterans looking for something new, challenging, and deeper than Hearthstone, with production quality to match, owe it to themselves to give Artifact a go. Look past the immature review bombing of the vocal minority - the cheap and self entitled who think everything should be free - and remember that it's okay to actually pay a little money for a game. The monetization isn't half as bad as the kids would like you to believe it is and you don't need a full card collection to be competitive. You can score a huge amount of cards for less than 10 cents a piece and since you can only use a max of 3 copies of any card, with a few extra bucks you can create a solid deck.

Those who take the plunge should find themselves delighted by a fantastic experience that's sure to get even better with time.
Best current card game on the market, don't let the talk of horrible monitization scare you away. Dev team for the game listens to community concerns and cares about the state of the game. Community run tourneys and free play modes are great and fun ways to play the game certainly worth the inital $20 investment and then some.
This game is really great. The matches are tense, long, and contain a ton of really fun and complicated decisions each turn. Almost every time I've lost I can look back at a specific moment and see where playing differently may have won me the game. The draft mode is excellent, and it can also be played for free.

I was initially concerned about the monetization when it was announced but I've been pleasently surprised. As a long time Hearthstone player who spent Way Too Much Money On Packs as a teenager and later grinded gold on a F2P account, I think I genuinely prefer this game's open market to the standard closed digital TCG structure. Already you can build the majority of a deck very cheaply, and once the bubble on the meta rares pops then the price to construct a "tier 1" deck will most likely be around £25, with many cards being usable in several decks. This is cheaper than dumping £50 in to Hearthstone packs and hoping you'll get most of the cards you need and enough dust left over for the rest, and in that sense it feels less predatory. In the same vein, the cost to make a tournament ready deck is already much lower than MtG, whos decks often cost several hundreds of pounds to put together. Still, the £15~ entry fee is a barrier to players who want to try out the game, even if you get more than £15 worth of packs and tickets out of it.

Outside of the gameplay, there's some stuff that Valve need to work on. It'd be nice to have a robust profile system with stats and replays, as well as a ranked system for constructed and maybe even draft. Valve has publically stated that a "progression system" is their top priority post-launch, and there's a lot of beta features that were taken out at the last moment like chat and emotes, so it's reasonable to assume that the game is going to be getting these in updates over the next few months.

As a longtime Dota and TCG player, I can't really stress how much this game impressed me. There were many, many points since release where there was cause for concern about the quality of the game and the integrity of monetization, but I'm overwhelmingly pleased that Artifact isn't lacking in either of those fields. Top to bottom, this is a great game and one of the best of the year in my opinion.
Really good game. The monetization is like any other traditional tcg, I don't know why people are complaining so much.

EDIT: If you like card games (magic the gathering etc.) you will LOVE the monitization system, but if you play pc games you will hate it.
Most fun I've had with a CCG honestly. Gameplay is solid. Lots of tactical depth. Matches can get tense.

Monetization is fine IMHO. Cards should retain some value and there are plenty of modes that only require the intital game purchase (casual draft, event modes, social tournaments). You only need to build a collection of cards if you want to play constructed modes, and even then you can buy a competitive deck for cheap off the marketplace (you don't have to deal with RNG card packs).

Cool game overall. I dig it so far.
Heres my two cents and the real real on this game....

Hands down one of the most thought out, well crafted card games to date. IMHO rivaling the complexity of MTG itself coming out the gate. (I say this becuase MTG litterally has at least two decades worth of card material to utilize if you have been around long enough to experience it.

The game is a damn labor of love and you can feel it with every click, sound, card played, voice acted flavor text, animated, thought out, damn well balanced out the gate,match won or lost and i tip my hat and would love to hug the Creator himself for finally outdoing him that other game he made that was so popular. Good job sir.... i bow to you in respect. Having played card games for around two decades now this is the digital TCG that i have been waiting for for far too long.

Now the down side that everyone is in a hissy about is that after the 10 packs that you intially get with the game. each containing 12 cards. ( at least 3 uncommon and a rare in each pack, sometimes more if you are lucky), and 5 event tickets,( used to play in events that can net you even more cards if you are good at what you do, you are left to open up the wallet to buy more.
at 1.99 per pack 
Before you all go set the world on fire...ask yourself some of these simple questions and see if they help you understand the false sense of entitlement that you are spewing...

Have you ever played a game with a monthy subscription? and if so how much was it?

Have you ever ritually spent a certain amount of money on something for enjoyment or entertainment? maybe a movie once a month with friends or the wifu, or a night out for drinks, or that pack of cigs that you hide from your family cause you know you told them all you quit but you keep stashed away?

Do you have hulu or netflix ? both? Amazon prime?

and lastly have you ever played a tcg that wasnt digital? and if so did you ever have to spend money for the cards you played with? Better yet have you played a digital card game competitively and not had to spend money? (put your hand down Timmy, you aren't "teh bestest Kompetitor" just because you ritualistically beat the other 4 people that you play with at your school or other social circle... 

$1.99 a pack is reasonable...dont even try to argue it...Hell you spend $3.00 for a soft drink when you go out to eat and even Taco Bell cant fill you up on $3.00. And you can buy cards individually online through the game....and sell the ones you dont want...or sell them all when you decide you are done with the game, or turn the extra cards into more tickets to draft with.

Anyone making the arguement that you cant play this game competitively without spending money is......Absolutely right
and if thats your arguement you proabably shouldnt have scrounged through your couch cushions, laundry basket, and your mothers purse to come up with the $20.00 to buy the game and instead put that physical and mentaleffort into doing something to forward your economic status. And anyone saying that they can play other  digital TCGs competitively without spending a dime...arent really a competitor are they?

The problem is people dont have the willpower to say...i can reasonably afford to spend X amount of money per month on Y product and damn you for making me practice restraint. I want it all and i want it all now and i dont wanna have to pay for anything!....while sipping on their $9.00 starbuck vente mocha doub.... Its A DAMN COFFEE....Throw a GD snickers bar in  some maxwell house and you have the same damn thing!!

Im sure eventually Valve will buckle to the pressure and allow some sort of freebie method to obtain your phat lewts to please the masses...yay im so looking foward to all these people clogging up the player base.

Until then...if you love card games, strategy, or just damn good games do yourself a favor and get it already. Let the initial investment show you what it has to offer and you can decide wether its worth putting more money in to.

If you can stomach the monetization model, which is actually quite fair if you value your time, compared to games like Hearthstone and Magic the Gathering: Arena you are going to find one of the most deep and rewarding TCG released in a long time in Artifact.

In terms of complexity it is much more complex than MtG while both simplifying some base aspects of ressource management and adding another layer of complexity while eliminating the problem of nongames entirely (flooding etc).

The game plays smoothly on PC, as expected from Valve.

But while some concepts carry over, make no mistake, this is an entirely different game to MtG, especially the lanes, randomly spawning creeps and how priority/initiative is passed and used, all the while also retaining similar systems present in MtG that make it fun. Booster draft especially is a deep and rewarding experience and the monetization model (10-15% rake) of Draft is actually quite good. Currently its quite easy to go infinite to plus EV.

If you dont want to spend money to play in draft/constructed events, I find the limited experience quite lacking as people play either very badly when there are no stakes or are incentivized to concede early when the flop isnt going their way as there is no penalty for doing so.

I cant comment on constructed yet but the early decks and iterations of archetypes look quite fun to play and play against. Theres nothing overly degenerate and the combo decks have a hard time keeping up with ultra-aggressive tower/hero-kill strategies.

As a semi-competitive mtg player, I find Artifact to have a lot of potential and its currently a very rich gameplay experience. The success of Artifact is going to hinge on the quality of future expansions as the base set cards are very simple and straight forward. And if you are a competitive minded (tcg) player as well I wholly recommend you to get it. Artifact is real.
Okay guys, I must very honest here, as most of the reviews coming out are trashing ‘ONLY’ and I say it again ‘ONLY’ the economy of the game. 
Now let be put into perspective what this game is vis-a-vis Hearthstone and Dota 2 both of which I have played appx 2000+ and 5700+ hrs. respectively.
TL;DR : Rather than adopting the best part about DotA 2, its economy model, they scrap it for some pay to progress system. However, the gameplay/depth/mechanics overcome all the cons of Hearthstone.
Hearthstone: 
After dropping about 200$ and grinding the ladder, the highest I got was Rank-3, granted that I was not a pro; like many of you players out there who just want to have a good time, but I was completely statured with the gameplay! Why?
1.	Few Meta decks rule the ladder: Spam the meta decks is the game, I had reached a point that if I saw a Hero; I knew exactly what the cards were and the strategy, and so did my adversary, then we did was pray to the RNGesus for a good hand. Boring.
2.	Right when I funded the best Meta deck and grind the ladder the expansions go out of rotation, NEW meta decks crop up, back to the next 200$ cycle. Wallet blocked.
3.	Then you quit and realise it is impossible to get back into the game since you have missed 6 expansions and hundreds of cards. What the hell is going on?
4.	And finally, the Arena where the RNG just cripples you. Pray
DotA 2:
1.	Free Play. Yay
2.	Tons of New meta.
3.	Learn with friends.
4.	Excellent competitive scene.
5.	100% of the content unlocked.
Now coming to the mash up:
1.	Gameplay mechanics/ diversity has not statured the meta yet.
2.	Initial investment gets you along way.
3.	New player/Returning player friendly.
4.	The Phantom Draft in the casual mode is the absolutely amazing, access to all the content, so much replay ability.
5.	But to do all the above except The Phantom Draft, one must play the Credit Card.
Suggestion for the devs:
Please make Casual Phantom Draft a way of earning cards for constructed. 5 wins lets you keep a few cards, maybe? Or X no of wins gives in casual or featured gives you tickets???? We need a way to play/ learn/ earn tickets PLEASE!!!!!!

Game is great and relatively inexpensive for a CCG. Poor and unintelligent people need not apply.  

Deep mechanics, great art, fun sound design.  This game knocks it out of the park.
This game is extremely well crafted. Despite what people say you can easily get more cards by playing. I'm not saying that they are going to hand the cards over. You have to get decent at the game but once you do, you can most likely at least get your event ticket back for a round two. There are plenty of free options to practice every mode. Yes you can pay for the cards but you really don't have to. The strategy is well planned and carried out. Card design and art is beautiful. Three lanes isn't as hard to leard as many are saying. OVERALL...great game.
I've played a lot of card games, and this is easily in the top 3.
Actually, it's one of the best designed *games* ever, not just as far as card games go. And I wasn't even looking forward to it at all, I just got curious after hearing some of the mechanics it has.

I worry that expansions might end up ruin it with more stupid cards, but it's currently great and full of strategy like no other. It's basically a turn-based strategy game with cards, more so than a traditional card game.

People complaining about the monetization are just dumb and apparently don't realize you can recycle cards for tickets and sell ones you don't need. It's actually a lot better and easier to go infinite with only needing 3-2 wins which is waaay more generous than any other online card game that I can think of. Hearthstone you need to freaking go 6-3 or 73 or whatever, so who gives a shit that you can grind stupid dailies for gold?

I hope the monetization doesn't change due to whiners. The reason Hearthstone takes so many wins to go infinite is to offset the whole ability to grind. I prefer it being easier to go infinite by far.
The criticism of the pay model seems silly to me. You can play with any cards in the game for free (after buying the game). It's only in constructed/expert mode that you need to own the cards. The overwhelming majority of cards can be purchased for pennies thru the marketplace. Regardless. the game is complex amd fun - and worth paying for instead of expecting the entire experience for free. I belive Valve will put a progression system in place allowing players to grind for cards or event tickets.
Artifact has a wonderful level of complexity while streamlining aspects of the UI to make it approachable.  There is quite a bit of depth in the way you can combine colors / heroes / strategies.  I like that they have events you can buy into and also free options for play / practice like Phantom draft.  I'll update this review as I play more and continue to get a feeling for the game.  First impressions are it is extremly fun and engaging.
A deep and complex  TCG that I highly recommend to anyone who likes to challenge themselves. As a long time MTG player this game has impressed me with its depth of strategy.

As far as the economy, it's very close to that of MTGO, with the exception that there are a lot of free modes, the best of which is a free phantom draft mode. Buying a top tier deck and playing only prize giving gauntlets will cost you money, but you are certainly able to play the game without paying a dime more. And of course if you do put money into the game you are still able to 
cash out via the Steam marketplace. No other digital card game on the market allows for this.
As a start, the game is visually excellent, gameplay is fun and intense, feels pretty well balanced already (aside from you, Cheating Death), and strategy is wonderfully deep. All in all, as a game, it's pretty hard to fault.

So, monetisation. This issue is massively blown up, imo. For those who just want to pay the initial price, you can play non-'expert' modes of both Draft (in which you have access to ALL cards) and Constructed for free, which is pretty awesome for TCG's - so imo it's completely playable as long as you want to have fun, of which this game offers much, and don't get some kind of e-peen thing from playing Expert modes.

There are already several 'Pauper' builds (decks that can be built from the standard cards) available online that have good playability for the casual constructed mode.

And on the other hand, I felt like getting a better deck than the one I had. All I had to do was buy them, in-client, with about 20 of the cards I needed totalling a mighty £0.70. The only way I got shafted was on Blink Daggers, which are a hard item to pull - but buying them for about £2 each meant that I had access to a *very* strong deck having just spent 5 minutes and £5-6. That's about 3 packs. In something like HS, those items would be classed as Legendary - how much would it have cost me in either time or buying RNG packs to grind those 3 specific legendary cards? Way more time, and maybe money, than what I just spent. And, as the prices of Blinks will probably remain that kind of price, if I decide I don't like the game anymore, I can probably just sell those, and I'd at least make £11-13 buy just scrapping all of my current cards. 

Just think of the monetisation as an exact, digital replication of IRL card games. Competitive cards cost money, competitions have entry fees. The HS process is not the best, and is *exceptionally* expensive/grindy for new players. With this system, yes, there is no way to RNG cards for free - but there is also no grind, and new players can instabuy a good competitive deck for very little money (vs some of HS' decks costing a few hundred dollars or massive amounts of grind). Axe (who is more expensive than most of the cards combined) isn't even broken, and is easily countered.

All in all, the monetisation is in no way objectively worse than HS, and where it lacks it makes up for it in other ways.
I don’t undestand why people are bi***ing about the payment model to be onest. It’s a TCG with a Market Place that works, in which you have different options after you start and pay the initial 20£. I actually feel that people are appoaching the game in the wrong way simply because once you start you follow one of this two routes. 

1)	You open your packs, see what you get (I don’t recommend this, you might get starter deck heroes or multiple copies of basically useless spells that you don’t want to start playing in Casual Constructed), if you don’t get anything juicy from them you start becoming unhappy, you play the only modes in which it's possible to obtain other packs for another shot and then as a consequence burn your tickets during your first ten hours of gameplay (without knowing anything really deep about the game, mechanic wise and such). Your experience is doomed to feel terrible. Why? Because later on even if you end up enjoying the game you would feel forced to spend the money to try and compete in expert mode for another chance of getting those packs, which might be ok for some and not ok for others. More commonly as I can see from other reviews you might direclty blame the payment model simply because you're not used to having little resouces and you're used to blowing them quickly. 

2)	You don’t open your packs, you learn the game by either watching streamers or playing Casual Constructed/Phantom Draft and once you’ve got the hang of it you go for Keeper Draft. I talk from personal experience here, I wasn’t in beta, I didn’t play this game before launch (but I’ll admit that in the last week I have a watched a lot of content from Mogwai and Swim which helped me out a lot in improving my experience and performance in this game). This mode is the best deal for your bucks, you get in, have a chance to ignore cards that you’re not interested in playing and you might even get lucky and get some good rares (I got a ToT and Annihilation from mine and it’s pretty common to find at least one really good card in this mode, because once somebody gets good cards for two-three colours it’s not safe to just get the priciest in your fifth-pack pick, it might even be detrimental for the deck you’re going for, as a consequence some good cards end up in second and third pick). Why is Keeper Draft the best mode? Simple, people either go for full gold-hunt, which works as a bye most of the time. They sacrifice a lot of flexibility while taking the rares and end up with overall bad decks. But the most important reason which you might overlook at first is the fact that by going 3-2 you don’t just go even like in phantom draft, you get one pack, which is HUGE if you think about it, and getting 3 packs with 5 wins feels great. Summing these two factors together your chances to go to 3 wins with a good draft are great and you and up with a positive balance.

Personally a huge point in favour of this game is that you can start playing FOR THE SAKE OF PLAYING whenever you want, you don’t have to feel bad for not logging for a couple of days, losing some quests or by being forced to play classes that you don’t really have good decks for in Friendly matches just to get that 50 gold (I’m going to use some Hearthstone comparisons because it’s clearly the most popular CCG, no doubt).

On one hand if you have the free time to spend on grinding and you don’t have any source of income this game does not make the cut, especially if you are already used to playing other card games in which you have an already established foundation, both in knowledge and card wise. 

On the other hand if you have had any experience with TCGs growing up I would say give it a shot, as a TCG the economy is ABSURD, the priciest cards right now are totally okay if you plan to go competitive (most of the cards that are really strong go for 5 to 10£ each and the priciest right now is Axe which will stand at the top for quite some time, and Drow Ranger is the only cards that even rivals him at around 15-20£) and I believe that there are going to be lots of events online with good price pools, if you know other people that you trust you can also do some tournaments by putting together some money for a good price pool.
 
The player experience is only going to improve if content creators make some moves and start making tournaments with 4-5$ entry fees with 10-12 people or more, they could make some really cool stuff going, but we’ll see how it ends up.
 
As far as I’m concerned this game is totally what I was looking for, Gwent HC is not in a good spot and I don't find it enjoyable even with a full collection, Hearthstone feels more like a grind and the last few metas have not been too good to incentivise the time spent on it. 

It’s a 9/10 to me, still missing some features but overall best card game of the year, let’s just hope that the quality of the expansions that are to come will push the game on the top of it’s genre and doesn’t change the feeling that you’re in control of your wins AND your losses.

Way more fun than i thought it would be, every game feels like i have a chance, even when i feel very far behind. Also same in reverse though sadly :).  Still thinking about some of the plays i missed (why didn't i use the blink dagger on zeus to get a double thunder fury turn... dammit). Tahnks so much for the game, amazing.

Ignore the haters, play the draft modes, getting 3 wins is not too hard and you get your entry back (or just play the casual modes and play for free with all the cards forever)
I'd been following Artifact for a number of months prior to launch. No alpha, no beta. Is the game perfect? No. Is it great? yes, yes it is. This is an advanced, exception strategy tcg that is still finding its footing from a conceptual, technological and community standpoint. With that said, the theoretical hope is for this game to be long lasting; therefore, the monetary aspects are fine (in my book). This is a tcg after all. I understand that Hearthstone and MTG are free services, but they are, in my opinion, less sophisticated and skill centric - MTG obviously not falling into this category in all respects. The $20 dollar fee does not seem predatory, nor do the additional costs that you can spend. This is part of the fun for me. I honestly feel like people are used to being handed everything noadays, the grind and challenge is what ultimately makes the success rewarding. Lets see what happens down the road. Do not lose faith in this because people are talking about microtransactions, if you improve your skills this game will become free and you can potentially net some profit. 9/10.
Breath of fresh air for a card game i love it! 
Not as expansive as people say but yeah it cost money.
Would recommend it for any card game enthousiast!
Game is very deep and fun. Both deck crafting and draft are skill testing with lots of room to experiment. Game can be pretty much free if you sell all the cards you get for the initial 20 bucks and any prize packs from expert phantom draft. This allows you to free phantom draft forever, which is the best game mode.
2 starter packs + 5 event tickets + 10 call to arms packs + 1 month dota plus. not bad.

Update
------------
After 5 casual matches, I changed my mind and not recommend this game anymore.
I didn't win any single game because I can see my opponents has more advanced card.
You can harass them very hard but in the end their one card can take you down easily.

no, I don't speak english. ok?
I really like this one. Solid mechanics that are kind of refreshing in a way similar to when I first picked up Gwent. I like the ability to actually sell my cards on the market place as well as the ability to directly purchase cards like in a physical card game.

As for monetization, I understand the issues with being unable to earn packs in game and needing to buy them: it's a drastic departure from other digital card games and step towards how physical card games work. I don't know if I like it yet, but I don't think it's a deal breaker for me.

I'm curious if this in anyway will affect the prevalance of net decks since there is no direct incentive to win casual games like in every other digital card game. I also like being able to draft for free, something that neither gwent not hearthstone have(I think)

TLDR, I like it a lot, but I'm curious if the monetization shift to more of a physical card game model will ended up being fine or break this game
If you're looking for a game that will let you grind for free after paying 20 dollars this game is not for you.

This game is more akin to buying in to a proper physical CCG. You spend upfront for an ok start but then the rest is up to you to buy what you want.

The gameplay is staggeringly complex and rewards deep strategy and well thought out play. The games are long but winning feels like hard work paying off.

For those looking for ranked ladder, the current iteration of this game does not include one. So if you really want to play and rank up PLEASE WAIT.

Overall my experience playing this game has been extremely fun but needs some QoL changes. If you are on the fence at all I recommend waiting 100% to see how things shake out. Cards will only decrease in value and be cheaper to pick up down the line.

All in all the game has issues but is insanely fun.
This shouldn't be called Artifact, this should be called Yugioh, or Magic the Gathering, or Pokemon.

This is not an online card game, this is a real-life card game, a tcg, on a computer. And it's amazing

Real life card games allow for a secondary market, they allow you to buy what cards you want without having to buy packs/lootboxes, the main things that are so annoying about games like Hearthstone. And valve dove head first into this new market and got it right the first time and it's wonderful. It's like playing a real-life card game online and I get to make my deck for 10 bucks rather than pay 50 for Hearthstone card packs and hope I get what I want.

I've been around forums a lot and I don't understand what people are on about. They're calling this pay to win. How? In what universe? And even funnier they say Hearthstone is an example of a good monetisation system. Have ea and blizzard won in the end? Have we succumbed to the lootbox era?

Artifact is pay to play. Hearthstone is pay to win, simple as that. you **need** to pay exorbitant amounts in Hearthstone to get anywhere because of the randomness. Hearthstone is a CCG. Artifact is a CCG. You pay to enter events and even that can be remedied by recycling worthless cards. You pay once for whatever you want and you never have to pay again. You pay less to play artifact than you do to play Hearthstone.

I've played Hearthstone for years. I've had free to play periods, I've had periods where I paid 100 euros on new sets. It was never enough, never enough to be the best. Here I pay 10 and have all the fun I want. It's such a relief. I'm never touching hearthstone, duelyst, elder scrolls online, eternity or any of the other clones every again. This is my card game now and I'm not regretting a single penny spent.

Not to mention that beyond the brilliant monetisation scheme, this is a genuinely good game. It's a fun and innovative system, it has great balance, it has decks for beginners and decks for pros. Anyone can play and still have fun with minimal investment. Don't forget people. This isn't microtransactions, this is you buying the cards off of other players and you trading cards with other players. Treat this as your schoolyard Yugioh from 10 years ago and not like a corporate shill game like Hearthstone. I don't want to grind 1000 hours for a few packs. I want to play now and not have to pay more money for it than it's truly worth. This game is every TCG player's wet dream.
This is my first pre-ordered game in my life, I really like the mechanics plus the potential story too in the comics and the sound clip each cards but Artifact has no big updates except the leveling system and players is declining, though I don't experience long finding match queue but still this game needs love, I don't mind if the game become free to play
Best card game I've ever played. It's deep and complex and so many games are a cuthroat thrill to leathal damage. The monetization model is reasonable, and you can get most cards for pennies. The expensive ones are pretty good but not overpowered honestly. Strategy is far more important.
I was one of those people who were, to put it lightly, [i]upset[/i] about the Artifact announcement.  I wasn't (at the time) a big fan of the Dota franchise, and the closest I'd ever come to enjoying a virtual card game was Solitaire.  I was not going to enjoy this game, because it wasn't a new Portal or a new Half-Life or a new Left 4 Dead.  I was not going to enjoy this game, because card games were all awful.  I would buy the game because, hell, it was the first game Valve would release in years and if buying this game would encourage them to make other games that I actually wanted, then so be it, but I was not going to enjoy this game.  I was not.  [i]I was not![/i]

.....I enjoyed the game.

There's a surprising amount of love and work put into this game, from the lengthy lore descriptions of the cards and expansions to the beautiful artwork on each card; from the seamless and adorable animations on the imps to the various bantering and bickering the characters (both imp and card) engage in.  They absolutely did not have to put that much detail into the game, but they [i]did[/i] and its amazing.  As for the game itself, it's surprisingly easy to pick up on the basics and start playing.  As for playing [i]well[/i], yeah, it takes a lot of practice.  But that practicing is so much fun that it's worth it.  And that's the other thing: it doesn't feel like a chore to play.  I never got into playing other CCGs because they always just seemed like they were tedious for the sake of being tedious.  But Artifact goes so fast and the matches are so tense, it's exciting.  The first night I played I ended up sinking two hours into the game, which I had not planned on at all.  So if you can get someone who thinks card games are the most boring thing ever to spend that long playing your card game, you're doing something right.

And the monetization model makes no sense, until you realize it's based off physical trading card games.  I used to collect Pokemon cards (never played them, just collected them), and man that could add up fast.  Twenty bucks for a deck, five bucks for a booster, hopping onto eBay to buy individual cards that ranged from mere cents to hundreds of dollars...sounds a bit like Artifact, doesn't it?  In fact, with the boosters only being two bucks here, it's actually cheaper.  The virtual model does work against it here, because it's a lot easier to defend that sort of money spent when you get physical items in return, but still.  I can see what they were trying to do.  Not sure if it's working, but it's a nice experiment.

TL;DR, I went into the game expecting to hate it and I actually kind of like it.  It's a beautiful-looking easy-to-learn-but-difficult-to-master entertaining little card game.  10/10, neat cards game.

[strike]Valve let me pat and/or put hats on Lux and Nox plz.[/strike]
Sweet game with a seemingly endless learning curve; the meta is gonna get weird. Played Magic for 22 years and it is nice to switch it up. Thanks Rich and Gabe!
I think this is some of the best CCG gameplay I have experienced in a very long time. I understand peoples complaints about the pricing model, however I disagree with them. You can easily get a full collection of cards for around $150 USD or less. I know that is a lot of money but unless you're a completionist you really don't need a complete set. Also, compared to most other CCG's it is very nice to have the option to just purchase the cards you need instead of having to break down a bunch of other cards for the ability to craft just 1. Also, if you ever decide you want to quit Artifact or move to a different type of deck. You can sell your collection.
Thought I'd chip in, and simultaneously chip away at all the negative (and imo, vapid) "credit card is best card", or "iTs NoT hAlF lIfE 3" reviews I've been seeing on what is otherwise a great trading card game. If you're into games like Magic: The Gathering, Hearthstone, or any of the other numerous card games out there, then there's a lot you'll appreciate in this game. 

If you really don't like microtransacions (which is completely understandable), or the idea of buying a few card packs to build your own decks, then your $20 is better spent elsewhere. If you've played literally any TCG before, and enjoyed it, then you'll like this game.
I am very excited for its compettitive esports future. It is a highly engrossing game with complex and entertaining gameplay. I am looking forward to improving at the game. I dont want to comment on the market as it is very volatile atm as it settles but I am enjoying that I can buy individual cards from the market without packs. Hopefully, the updates continue to improve the game.
First the gameplay: it is insanely fun, but kinda stressful and intense in the same way as Dota. If you're looking for a card game you can half ass while watching streams on another monitor this isn't for you. There are so many variables because of the three lane system, you have to be thinking ahead constantly and there are always options. You'll hardly ever play a game perfectly, and most of them come down to the wire.

Now the monetization: yes, for constructed you have to buy cards. Cracking packs isn't terribly efficient, though you can find websites that track the EV for a pack so you know when it's worthwhile to open them and sell the cards. The market is fluctuating quite a bit right now, and I don't really think it's worthwhile spending money on a constructed deck right now until it settles down. However, even now the price of a competitive deck or even a full set of cards is much less than HS or Magic. Still there is no option to grind instead. 

To me though, that is besides the point. The best mode by far is draft, since you use and see a wider variety of cards and constantly have to think about the deckbuilding (rather than just getting one constructed netdeck and rolling with it). Casual phantom draft (no rewards) can be played endlessly without paying more and that alone is worth the price of admission. Competitive phantom draft is $1 a run with rewards, though tickets can be had cheaper than that by buying commons on the market and recycling them. 

Bottom line is the game is FUN AS HELL, best digital card game ever by far in terms of the actual play, and for the best mode you don't even have to think about the market or packs.
Deep, complex game with lots of meaningful decisions. Cheaper than Hearthstone and MTGA for most formats. No F2P model, but that is intentional and the overall economy isn't predatory at all. DOTA lore is fun to explore. Base game gets you a lot, including free phantom drafts. If you are at all interested in card games, would definitely recommend.
* Simple mechanics combine to provide deep gameplay.
* Free draft play.
* Most matches so far were decided by player skill, despite the RNG inherent in card games.
* Graphics and gameplay environment are beautiful.
* If you want a card, you just buy it from other players on the [b]online marketplace[/b].
* Lore is actually interesting, the comics are really good so far.
* Unprecedented options for player hosted tournaments in the client.
* It's a Valve game, so it's going to be well supported with content patches.

Why has it taken so long for a digital card game to take advantage of the digital platform?
Recommened for casual gamers who aren't looking to be seriously competitive. 

I got Artifact to relax and play against bots and for that it's amazing.  I got nothing to say about the monitization issue people are talking about but I hope it gets sorted out quickly.  With that said, one thing I was hoping to see was a card game not based on an existing IP but instead with all new characters. I think the gameplay is very fun but I have a lot to learn and I have lost every single game out of the 7 or so that I've played. Artifact keeps me interested all the way to the end and I can't just play 1 game. Based on the drama I have seen and read online, I would probably not recommend this game to anyone who is seriously compeditive and looking for something cheap to get into, but if you have a lot of money then the show is all yours.
Gameplay = Amazing
Game features and client = Good but rough around the edges
Monetization = Good

This game's gameplay is so good that it's worth buying just to play the free draft modes. You can play in the free draft modes in tournaments or in match making. I haven't ventured into constructed yet, but I did open all my original packs and sell a duplicate card that I did not need for $4 and bought two more packs with it. I also recycled some cheaper duplicates into an event ticket. 

If you're good, you can "go infinite" or at least break even in competitive. If you're not good, you can play the free draft and constructed modes to get good. I'm having a blast. For anyone who only likes constructed and doesn't want to play with a weak deck, there are events with preconstructed decks that you can learn from. 

I've had a ton of fun and just won my first expert phantom draft 5-0 and came out with 2 packs as my reward.
It's a tough card game. It is complex. It is not for people who like easy games. The costs of the cards are almost negligable and you can have fun without spending a lot of money, you don't have to buy packs. 

If you like card games, you may be interested in Artifact.
If you like Hearthstone, this may be too deep/complex for you.
If you like MTG, this may be the game for you.
If you like Slay The Spire, this may be the game for you.

Buy it, play a few games, and if you don't like it, return it before the 3 hrs. 

The game is certainly for a niche group of people. I am one of them.
Fun game with deep and strategic gameplay. Despite the deluge of comments about the game being pay to win, the game (so far at least) appears to be considerably cheaper than other online card games. The offset to this being there is no way to grind out packs.

Personally I prefer this model as I do not enjoy the feeling of requirement to play every day or grind out packs.
Amazing game, extremely deep and rewarding gameplay.  You can draft for free as much as you would like and cards are cheap on the market, way more affordable card game than anything else out there.
It really pains me to scroll through the reviews page for Artifact and see so many negative reviews on what is, quite honestly, an absolutely freaking fantastic game. The negative reviews seem to fall into two general categories: those submitted by people who didn't do any research into the game before buying, and are now upset that they can't get a refund after redeeming, or worse, OPENING the included card packs (really? I mean, REALLY?;) and those submitted by players whose idea of what makes a "good" card game has been so irreparably tainted by outrageously unbalanced grindfests like Hearthstone that they can't even imagine a game where monetization consists of anything other than pulling out your wallet just to bypass the hundreds upon hundreds of hours of throwing your meager pool of basic cards against "optimized" (read: expensive) decks containing half a dozen broken legendaries, and trying not to give in to the ceaseless calling of the in-game store as you get repeatedly shitcanned by impossibly broken combos and stupid synergies between ultra-rare cards. If that's what appeals to you, more power to you. I wish you nothing but good times, if you're into that sort of thing. But please don't come here and trash Artifact as being expensive or P2W or "a scam," because it is none of those things. Artifact may not be your cup of tea, but it is a fantastic game.

First, before I get to the meat of this review, let me set one thing straight. YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY PLAY ARTIFACT FOREVER WITHOUT PUTTING MORE MONEY IN. What's more, you won't even be at a disadvantage at all. Artifact has this magical thing called "casual phantom draft," which you can play for free* (after your inital $20 purchase) forever, as many times as you want, all day, every day, without needing to own even a single card. The skill floor for draft modes is arguably a bit higher, but once you catch on, you will be on a level playing field with every single other player in the game. And it's free. Forever. And if you're asking, "Yeah, but is it fun?"... yes, it totally is. In fact, I think it's MORE fun than the constructed mode. And it's free. Did I mention it's free? Oh, and there are also modes where you can play with pre-built decks, either with random players or with your Steam friends. Also free. So let's be clear here, if you are putting any additional money into Artifact, it's because you want to, not because you have to. It's still a phenomenal game even at the basic $20 price point, and I'd still recommend it even if you refuse to put one more cent into it beyond that.

With that out of the way, let's talk about the parts of Artifact that aren't free. First is the constructed mode, where you assemble a deck from among cards you own. I chose to use my initial packs to play two rounds of Keeper Draft, which allowed me to pick the cards I wanted from a larger pool rather than relying 100% on chance, and afterwards I chose to spend another $1.50 on a handful of cards I thought would round out the deck nicely. And yet, despite the fact that my deck literally cost me a buck and a half beyond my inital investment (less than the price of a single Arena run in Hearthstone,) I win games with it. A lot of them. Anyone who tells you that you need to sink hundreds of dollars into buying three copies of every single card in order to be competitive is full of it. Beyond constructed, there are the "expert" gauntlet modes, which effectively have a $1 entry fee (half the price of Hearthstone's arena mode) and, if you manage to win more games than you lose, you get that $1 ticket back at the end, plus a pack or two if you do really well. Any cards in those packs that you don't want can be resold on the Steam Community market, or "recycled" into more event tickets, allowing you to not only go infinite in expert gauntlets, but actually GAIN tickets if you're good enough. So, again, this line about Artifact being an endless pay-to-win money hole is absolute garbage. Being a whale gets you next to nothing, and there are many, many ways to be competitive as a low-to-no budget gamer, depending on what mode you're playing.

Enough negativity and money-talk, though. Let's talk about the actual game for a second, because that's what this is actually a review of. I know I've said it before, but Artifact is really a genuinely good game. It manages to strike a really great balance between the strategic complexity of a game like MTG, whose mechanics are incredibly deep but border on arcane, and games like Hearthstone or Gwent that focus on accessibility to casual gamers. Artifact is simple enough that you'll be able to fully understand what's going on within a day, but it offers such an astounding level of choice at every moment, which makes it incredibly tactical experience. As opposed to turn-based games like... well, pretty much every card game, Artifact works on a system called "initiative," which makes it feel more like chess or fencing than a traditional TCG. When you have initiative, you get to do ONE thing. One. Play a card, use an ability, whatever. As soon as you do, though, your opponent gains initiative and gets to make one play of their own. Gameplay flows like a dance back and forth between the players, with both sides trying to set up a favorable exchange once the shots start flying. When you're satisfied with the carnage that's about to unfold, or don't have anything left to do at the moment, you pass initiative back to your opponent, who can then choose to play another card, or pass as well. When both players are satisfied, combat happens, and the game moves on to the next board. (Oh, yeah... while all this is going on, you're managing resources and planning future plays across three separate boards or "lanes," with the victory condition being to either win two of the three, or thoroughly wallop your opponent in one lane before they can beat you in the other two.) Optimal play often involves intentionally taking a beating by passing on opportunities to play cards, just so you can get first play on a crucial lane, or abandoning a lost lane entirely in favor of taking the other two before your opponent can completely overrun the one you've already lost. Every single moment is a calculation, especially since a play that's too obvious can be cut short by an immediate riposte by your opponent as soon as initiative passes to them. Do you take the safe route and heal your wounded hero first, or play a powerful spell and save the healing for later, risking the weak target potentially being nuked down in response? There's none of the all-too-familiar, "Oh, gee. I wonder what ridiculous combo my opponent is going to pull out of his ass THIS turn." Rather than having 15-minute Yu-Gi-Oh monologues where the bad guy spends two commercial breaks explaining how he sets up some insane one-hit kill using half his deck, the initiative system allows you to potentially intervene at any point, either clicking on the "pass initiative" coin over and over as if to say, "Okay, I'm not going to stop you... yet," or pulling out your own trick to cut your opponent's plans short. One of the most satisfying feelings in Artifact is participating in a multiple-card back-and-forth over whether a particular hero is going to die when combat happens (equipping +health items, playing spells, using active abilities to switch positions on the battlefield,) and seeing the red X indicating they're about to die disappear, then re-appear, then disappear, then... a pause, and after 5 seconds, the satisfying "clink" of your opponent passing initiative back to you. Seriously, that clinking sound is fantastic. One of the best parts of the game, second only to its mechanical beauty (thanks to MTG creator Richard Garfield) and its incredible soundtrack (thanks to Valve's in-house composer Tim Larkin, who also did the music for Dota 2.)

Verdict: Beautifully designed, incredibly polished, and damn fun. Solid 9.5/10.
Blizzard fanboys, why do you write that you can't play with other people without donations ??? From this BIG deception in your game (hearthstone) no more players will become. 
Sometimes, when I reading all these reviews, I get the impression that the people who wrote here their BAD review about donations( especially from experts what have 0.1-4 hrs play time), they probably did not go further than the main menu in this game. LoL. I agreed that Artifact has some problems with progression and motivation, but actually, monetization is the not a big problem of that game. there is a lot really good free game modes. Also in my personal opinion, they should increase rewards a little from free game modes
This game has an incredible amount of depth. Every match I've played has been a nail biter. Every card feels balanced, fair and fits a very skill-focused meta. I initially thought the amount of RNG would be a dealbreaker in this one, but everything (with the exception of one card - Cheating Death, which isn't played often) has been built up to encourage a reaction-based gameplay experience that rewards thinking ahead. This game brings back great memories of playing MTG in college, and does without all of the frustrations that Hearthstone caused me (grinding and loot boxes). $20 is a totally reasonable price, considering the value of packs and cards, and the amount that is available on launch. Valve has a great track record of continuing support for their multiplayer experiences, and I have no doubts they will be treating Artifact with the same level of care. Progression systems, chat, and more features are in the works, but there's still plenty to tide you over until then. Would absolutely recommend.
Monetization model’s not perfect and I’d love to see packs and the market go the way of the D3 RMAH.

However, $20 for infinite free drafts is still good value and the game itself whips scrote.
the full price of the game translates to

10 packs of cards 
unlimed phantom draft mode 

game lacks progression of any kind, need to shell out money when entering a keeper draft (costs = 5 packs + 2 tickets)

cards are cheap to the point that you can build a competitive deck for less than 10$, Axe is overhyped, drow ranger is overhyped, blue/black deck always wins.

ez surgery on a grape/10
Its a damn fun card game, however for whatever reason people find it hard to believe that you have to buy card packs in order to play a freaking card game. While i do understand the reasoning that you should atleast be able to earn a pack of cards from getting in game currency or someother ways and i fully support that. What i dont understand is the community calling valve and this game a scam - it baffles me. 

Alot more improvements can be made; event tickets, ranked gameplay, chatting, etc. But it is a solid game.

Artifact is a fun and complex card game where you don't have to feel guilty for buying cards since this is the intended way users get new cards. You should avoid this game if paying for digital cards offends your sensibilities. If you can afford it though and you like card games, you will probably enjoy this game.
I don't know how, but this game was in my library. I discovered when I went to buy it... 
Anyhow I would have been happy with my purchase, and even happier I got it for free. Fun.
As a Heartstone player that gave up on buying cards after de 3rd expansion because they were going to be rotated out I feel Artifact is a way better model for me. So far I'm having a blast with this game.

Edit: Just discovered thye Casual Phantom Draft and it's insanely fun. It's everything I wish Heartstone's arena would be, I feel I can play this mode endlessly. It is so good that I'm affraid they will make it paid.
It's actually a really good card game, feels very fresh and exciting with a bunch of new mechanics that work really well. However the biggest issues seems to be the monetization. There are currently zero methods of obtaining any source of currency to obtain packs and progress without paying money. I do believe this to be really harmful for the game since it will drive off a lot players who were already skepitical about paying 20$ for a card game when hearthstone and many others are free but you have to remember many of the 'clones' failed and ended up closing their servers not too long after release because they had no profit margins(I assume).  This game may seem expensive at first but really decks can cost fairly cheap where the most expensive card in your deck may cost 10$ at most and 20$ is actually the most expensive card. So if you are on the fence I would urge you to try it out and if you truly feel as if the game play does not overcome the preceived cost then attempt to refund it (Obviously don't open your packs/use tickets). If you do not wish to purchase try watching some streamers.
If you find this pay model predatory, you don't understand what T in TCG means.
This game would be better as full priced LCG but as opposed to any other digital CCG (eg. Hearthstone) it does it thing right and only time can tell if this business model will support the game long term. As it stands most of the cards are dirty cheap in range of 10 pence, only about 10 cards right now cost more than 1 pound and Axe and Drow Ranger are about 10 pounds. 
You don't buy a game but rather a starter kit with 10 booster packs and 5 tournament tickets, like in MTGO.
It is true that it might go to hell and cards could skyrocket if not enough people are opening packs, but considering there are drafts where you get to keep your cards and win prizes, I am quite optimistic, it is the most popular way players get and trade cards in paper Magic.

Also let me ask you one simple question. 
Do you have fun playing for couple of hours in hearthstone as a F2P player, or do you "grind" just to get a pack with your budget zoolock deck just to pray maybe you will get that Legendary you want? 
Because I'd rather buy a couple of single cards that are dirty cheap and have a deck that I thought out with and have fun playing with.

As it stands the current pricing is very reasonable and only time will tell if it goes up or down.
Stick to your Skinner box Hearthstone players.
People complaining about paying for cards in a TCG omegalul, great game, recommend it, just like any card game you have to spend some money to have all the cards but just like real life TCG you have to buy the cards anyway.
Don't understand all the people complaining about the monetization. You have unlimited casual play, and with Phantom Draft, buying cards doesn't matter at all. You draft your own deck from a randomized set of packs. In addition, Call to Arms allows you to play a bunch of different pre-constructed decks. For those saying they'll go back to hearthstone, every expansion there requires ~$200 + a bunch of grind to get all cards. Have fun spending ~$800 an year to stay competitive.

Great game volvo, it's legit real fun.
Felt like I had to review to counter some of these negative reviews over money.

Game is challenging and requires thought. Cost the same as any other card game in the world so that isn't an issue as some others are saying.

Only issue is valve taking a cut of you selling cards and no ranks in game modes yet.

I know it wasn't asked for but...

Experience in TCGs/CCGs:

> Former Yu-gi-oh player (regular YCS player with a couple of top 32s) - played for 8 years. 
> Former MTG player (did okay at events but nothing of note) - played for 3 years. 
> Hearthstone Legend (Doesn't really mean anything now but once did) - played since season 1
Contrary to the negative reviews, I consider Artifact's business model more than fair. Pay to play with the initial price being exactly the same price as the 10 packs you get upon logging in, thereafter buy packs for a reasonable amount of money or cards individually for a price determined by supply and demand.

Card prices for staple cards are a little bit high at the moment, but this is going to normalize in the next days or weeks. In other games, if you need or want a certain card, it may cost you between nothing and up to several hundreds of dollars/euros, since RNG is the only thing that determines the outcome. Missing a certain keycard for your deck/playstyle? Buy 40 packs and hope that you are lucky.
Missing one in Artifact? Buy it directly for a certain price (which, again, is going to settle for a resonable amount, even for the strong ones, in a couple of days).

The gameplay is very engaging and offers a lot of depth.
After playing and getting used to the triple lane thing, this is quite a different and challenging card game. Coming from a heavy TCG background, as well as a die hard Magic the Gathering and Richard Garfield fan, I can say a lot of thought has been poured into the game design. Something so simple and elegant that only the god of TCG can produce. Something worth your money and time to play and master.

The entry point is kinda steep, it's understandable since we're initially paying for the 10 packs and 3 event tickers. Even then it should be eliminated since we're going to pay to get more cards anyway. For those who are used to playing F2S (free to start) card games, this might be a major turn off. Especially with the no second free currency available. 

But let's take a step back and thing. Even with the second, "Free" currency how much can you get anyways? How much time do you have to farm every day for that currency? Personally I always bought packs from other digital TCG using real money anyway, and I don't have any control on the cards that I'll get from the packs.

The single cards that can be bought ouright using Steam's own marketplace is a godsend and should be the reason you give this card game a chance. In the market, I don't think there's any other well made TCG, developed by a big company like Valve and designed / supervised by the god of TCG, Richard Garfield himself, with the option to buy singles. 

I've always bought singles in my 20ish years playing Magic (and other TCGs), since buying booster packs in bulk or even booster boxes are not guaranteed to give me the cards I need. So having that kind of freedom in buying singles makes me want to keep on playing this game, at least for the time being. 

Just think of it, people. How many bundles and dozens of booster packs that you've bought until you got the card you need in other digital TCGs? If you're lucky with your pulls then good, but if not, you'll spend a lot of money trying to get the cards you want or until you enough materials to craft it using the secondary currency / materials system. 

If rotation should occur (and it should for any good TCGs to survive), I'll reconsider whether this game is worth buying and playing. But until then, I'll see you at the 3 lane battlefield fellow Steam players. Cheers! 


Compared to other card games on the market right now even those marketed as free to play Artifact offers the best and most cost efficent way to get into playing at a higher level. Unlike the amount of money you will spend opening random packs in Hearthstone for example the steam market lets you specifically designate cards you want to buy so you can save money and just pick up the singles you need like you could in a real world trading card game. The fact they offer this service is a blessing and will save you money when compared to other digital card games. Also, launch week prices are fairly low so things will only end up being more budget.
Pros:
-Deepest card game you'll ever find that is not Magic.
-Pleasing top notch visuals.
-Plenty of lore for the Dota nerds.
-Good amount of free modes for players who don't want to pay further yet still want to experience the full game.

Cons:
-Missing some features like: spectator mode, some kind of tournament browser.
-It doesn't allow you to slave your free time away. /s
Seems people think that, because hearthstone is free, every game should be free - like devs are just hobiests building games for fun on the weekends. I'm glad this is not free2play (I bought just the base game and am having fun so far - sold some cards, bought a few others - also, you don't have to play constructed, just play draft). I would like to see some kind of progression though.
[b]Overall[/b]
A card game that has the depth and strategy of Dota, and an honest monetization model that doesn't rely 100% on gambling with card packs. It's very diverse, has a lot of different strategies and the better player will always win. 

Artifact has three lanes, and you have to win 2 lanes, or destroy a single lane twice. The three lanes add an extra dimension, and deciding in which lane you place which card in the deployment phase is crucial for the outcome of the match. You can give items to heroes, and improve your tower, both in attack and defense. Some heroes can cast special abilities that have a set cooldown. All this just gives so much diversity to playstyles. 

[b]Monetization model[/b]
Yes, you can't gain any card pack just by playing the game and grinding. You will have to buy cards. You can also win card packs by winning 3 or more games before losing 2 games in expert mode. You enroll in these games for €0.90, and you can win the entry ticket back + 2 card packs maximum. If you're a good player, you will gain card packs by defeating others. 

The thing that sets Artifact aside is that you can buy cards from other players. You can create sets from any cards (also unowned) and just buy the unowned cards from the marketplace. Most cards are between €0.01 and €1,-. I just created an entire set for €10,-. No gambling with card packs, just buy the cards you specifically need for your set. In the end, you will spend a lot less money on this game than on other card games. People who immediatly downvoted this game just didn't think beyond the 'you can't win free cards' (which you can if you're a good player). 

[b]Downsides[/b]
- No ingame communication, guilds, or socialization. 
- No action overview. Sometimes it's difficult to see where spells or abilities came from and who it affected. 
- It crashes often. 

I have no doubt however that Valve will adress these issues, just this morning they put out a patch that at least fixes some of the crashing issues. 

[b]Conclusion[/b]
A very rewarding, deeply strategical card game with an honest monetization model.
Really satisfying gameplay, payment model is fair too. Don't need to buy anything more than the base game if you just want to play draft with friends.
Super fun. You can play for free all you want - if you want to compete for prizes WORTH MONEY - you have to USE MONEY. What a shocker.

Anyway - this game is really really fun and I'd rather pay a bit once in a while than slave away for thousands of hours for a bit of progress.
If you are a smart player, you can construct a powerful deck without buying further cards. and also there is a mode that lets you construct deck from any cards you want, so just enjoy this game!!
This game is actually super fun. Yes, you have to pay to play, just like in real-life Magic the Gathering, but it's honestly not as bad as all the negative reviews are saying. If you want a card game to grind on, this isn't it, you're better off in HS or Gwent. Everyone compares this game to HS but its much, much closer to Magic Arena. I, personally, do not find it fun to grind for the cards I actually want to play with. I would much rather buy singles off the market for a fraction of the cost of a pack than buy 150+ packs and still not get everything I need. I bought every common and uncommon card in the entire game for about $2.75 last night. Yes, there are cards like Axe and Drow that are going for over ten dollars right now, but you do not need to buy any cards at all if you just want to draft. If you like constructed, then the prices of these top tier cards are guaranteed to go down in the future as more people start playing and cracking packs open. You can do constructed and draft for free, you just need a ticket if you want rewards from it. It is possible to "go infinite" on tickets, especially with the ability to recycle your extra, low value cards. I'm self-reportedly bad at card games and I've still managed to make a decent draft and win some games. Ignore anyone saying "dead game" or "dead within a year"; this is Valve we're talking about. This game will continue to grow and receieve support for many, many years.

With all that out of the way...

This game has some actual strategy to it. It has a lot of depth and is a very cerebral experience, but still very fun and engaging. I thought I'd be overwhelmed with three lanes but it's actually easy to get the hang of. I'm not a pro nor have a math degree so I won't get too in-depth with the mechanics in a review. Even with just the basic Call to Arms set out right now theres a lot of interesting combos and synergies to explore. I'm very interested to see what will be in the next expansion. Draft is the popular mode right now but I think constructed will take off when we get more cards. Everything about the general presentation of this game blows others in the genre out of the water; the menus, the card effects, voice acting, it's all fantastic. Easily the prettiest card game out there. If you're a big fan of Dota, all the lore is equally fantastic.

There's no harm in waiting if you're still on the fence. There's no grind to fall behind on. Card prices will go down and Valve will add/change things over time.
So... Artifact,

Lets start with the game before we get into monetisation. It is a realy good card game with the right amount of strategic debt and a bit of luck to spice things up. I think the balance between skill and luck is ok, but sometimes luck realy screws you over, however this is the nature of card games.
The thing that is of however is the card balance. Sure in every card game there are good and bad cards but right now with the stil low amount of cards there are a few cards that are top tier and a stable in any deck. The balancing team should have a look at a few cards, it just feels bad sometimes playing against them (or see them in most matches)
Another positive thing that is realy striking about the game tho is the amazing soundtrack. Could listen to the menu sound for weeks. 

Now for the monetisation.
Hands down the entry price seems a bit strange for a card game with so many free to play titles right now. But what they give you for the money is pretty much worth it. And the best mode(draft) is included unlimmited in the starting price. 
Comparing it to other card games, I have not spend any money other then the base price and feel like I have a few competetive decks already. In hearthstone it took me weeks of grinding.
The thing that people ignore is that you can get all the cards in the game right now for arround 150$ on the steam market. You dont even need to buy packs. And this price will go down. Calculate all you want but in no other card game you get all cards for that low price. Sure it sucks that you cant grind for cards, but honestly I rather work my job for 10 hours and have all the cards in the game, then grind 100 hours with subpar decks before I can build some decent decks to grind more for the rest of the card set. To be honest its one of the best monetisation models for TCGs right now.

TL;DR: The gameplay is amazing, ballance is stil a bit off tho and needs work done. People need to stop jumping on the bandwagon and use their own brains to realise the game has one of the best monetisation models for a TCG.
The best card game experience on the market. Hopefully they release a draft ladder, so there despite not being any rewards associated with casual, you can at least feel like achieving something on that front.

"Expert" tournaments requires tickets for a dollar each, apparently they are using a MMR system so people(everybody good or bad) will average half a ticket and nothing ells each time they sign up. 

There is exactly no reward for getting 2 wins over 0 - which is such a bad PR call in my estimation.

The game itself is highly enjoyable, the game is quickly learned and allows for a lot of mobility, a match can easily last 20-30 minutes which has its positives and further distances it from the autopilot card games such as Hearthstone.
Great gameplay and strategical thinking required. Monetisation means getting a deck you want isn't that expensive compared to other similar games without grinding daily quests.
The only possible flaw with the monetisation i can imagine is that people dont like you dont get any free decks (i fair criticism maybe). I think its worth the trade. Its stupid that no other game has a trading platform like this does, its a no brainer in my opinion and im suprised its taken this long.
Good, game Magic the Gathering Online uses the same monetization system and it works by preventing the game from being a chore to play and allows it to be played soley for gameplay.
The best Trading card video game. Gameplay has phenomenal depth and strategic opportunities 

The Business model requires an upfront investment but in the long run is much fairer than its competitors my buying single cards on the market place.

Brilliant. Inventive. Deep.

It plays out more like an RTS than a traditional linear card game, rewarding skilled plays, position and mindgames more so than any other card game I've played.

Economy seems fair, near enough everything is available on the marketplace for pennies so no grinding for a particular card. Maybe not made for people with the mobile gaming F2P mindset and that's ok.
Richard Garfield has yet again created a masterpiece. Artifact is another game by the same man who created Magic the Gathering, Vampire, Netrunner and Keyforge to name a few. This is in my opinion the best online card game I have played to date. It is built to simulate a MOBA. Watch this video for a great guide on how the game plays and what it looks like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIQ21gPNix0

Best features:
1) Highly complex game with low randomness. Yes, there are some random elements built into the game. None dramatically impact the game. Winning the game is hardly ever due to random events (eg. poor card draw, no land). Instead winning is a culmination of small deliberate decisions. The winning player is usually the player who played consistently better throughout the match.

2) Cheap. 
The game costs the exact same as buying 10 booster packs of cards, and you get 10 boosters with the game. Every card can be sold or bought in the Steam marketplace. Commons currently go for about $0.05 each, uncommons for up to $0.15 each, most rares under $1. The occasional powerful card you may want 3x in the deck could cost up to $4 each. Occasional heroes with a 1x limit per deck can be more expensive. You can buy probably buy most decks of your choice for under $30. Once you are done with the game you can sell all the cards in the Steam marketplace and use the money to buy other games on Steam. Games like MtG:A and Hearthstone are money sinks where you are forced to grind for cards or pay huge amounts of money, then can never get the value back from the game. Additionally just by buying the game you get access to free phantom draft game mode, allowing you to play as many draft games as you want but with no card pack rewards. 

Note: you cannot earn cards by playing for free. You must either buy boosters or buy singles from the market - just like a physical CCG. The advantage is that you can also sell your cards when you are done with them.

If you like card games then you have to check this one out. No, it is not as good as Netrunner or Vampire. No, it is not a substitute for playing cards face to face. It is however easily the best online CCG I have played to date.
Probably the best design (graphics and interactions) ever made in a card game. Also I don't have a problem with the "monetisation", I think people blow it out of proportions. Everybody is ok paying $60 for the same old recycled FIFA or COD every year, but $20 for this is soo crazy, considering you also get maybe half of your money back receiving packs and tickets ( depending how un-lucky you are ). 
My only wish is they would cut down on the crazy RNG, when you can lose/win a game just by doing a flip coin.
Interesting mechanics, fun to play, takes a few games to get the hang of it. Really recommended for people who are stuck playing dota 2 and looking for a new game
Most negative reviews stem from entitled players who think that everything has to be given to them for nothing.

Artifact is a great game, it's well executed, challenging and the business model should not be taken as a negative. Look at it from an angle of a TCG game or compare it to MtG for example. You pay 18€ for a "starter deck" (game itself + 10 boosters + 5 event tickets). And let's not forget that 17.5€ is the price of 10 booster packs so youre essentially paying 0.5€ for the game, two decks and 5 tickets. 
Then you can trade whatever you open when you start out or obtain in the future for anything else you want. Treat is as trading card game, meaning you don't need to own a whole collection. Sell the stuff you don't want and buy the stuff you do and enjoy the game. There's literally no extra costs involved if you just plan accordingly. 

Artifact has managed to capture the essence of paper TCGs and created it on an online platform. I love it.
Also, fuck grinding for anything, it's literally the worst thing that has happened to gaming.
I have played countless hours of gwent, magic the gathering, hearthstone.  i have put hundreds of dollars into each


The singles market in this game is so inexpensive.  I bought my first 2 entire decks for less than $4. 
This is the strategic card game you have been waiting for.
Compared to the predatory loot box business model.  I spent FAR less money on this than any other digital card game.

I was going into this about to shell out $100 on boosters.  but that was totally uneeded.  

Now away from the money aspect.  The actual gameplay is incredible.  Easily the best card game I have ever played.
Nowadays I have more money than time. I don't plan on shelling out lots of cash for cards, but I appreciate that I don't feel obligated to grind for virtual currency. If I want to build a deck, I can find the cards I need on the market mostly for a couple cents. Besides that, there's still plenty of fun  to be had after the initial $20 buy in.

Monetization model aside, the game is polished, looks nice, and plays well. The complexity makes the game fun to learn as you play like Dota. Each card has its own lore voiced!
Solid game. The gameplay is the most inspired and mentally rewarding strategy you can find in a card game. I come from playing Magic (casually) and from playing Netrunner. Artifact is a masterpiece of game design and balance.

Lots of other reviewers are complaining the game is not F2P, but they continually miss the point with this games' design. It is a CCG, you fundamentally have to spend money to grow your collection. Things that make this less of a pain:

* you can sell cards ALL OF THEM, paying a fraction of your buyin cost
* money you obtain by selling extra cards you can spend on other cards you need
* the lowest value of a card is fixed by redeeming 20 for 1 ticket
* spending tickets allows you to win more cards
* you can play FREE MODES INDEFINITELY, just can't win cards

buy this game if:
* you have disposable income
* you like strategy games
[h1]As of December 21st, most (if not all) of the communities complaints were addressed![/h1]

First things first, you pay 18€ for the game and get 10 packs and 5 tickets. A pack costs 1.75€ and 5 tickets cost 4.50€, so you kind of get your money back. 

The gameplay in this game is really good. It's a bit complex at first sight, but it gets easier to understand really fast. (one or two games, and you start learning some strategy)

You get three lanes each game, each one with a tower, and have to fight your way to either destroy 2 towers (each in a different lane) or destroy a tower and then the ancient (I think that's its name) that shows up after that - so basically destroy a lane twice. 

Your deck consists of 5 heroes (which are the major influence on your deck) and 60 other cards which can only be played if a hero of their color is in the lane you're playing.



[strike]I just have an issue with this game, as everyone seems to have. Monetisation. I really trust Valve with their design, I haven't seen them being too greedy when it comes to sucking money off their customers. However, this game seems to have some faults in the way that you get cards.[/strike]

[strike]First of, there's no way to progressively get cards. This [b]feels[/b] wrong because we're used to being able to trade our time for content inside a game (instead of money, which, in the end, is time anyway). I haven't seen an explanation on this decision by Valve (which makes it a bit more suspicious).[/strike]

However! you CAN play drafts with every card, without [b]paying a single dime[/b]. So technically, you're not paying to play the most important part of the game (deckbuilding), you're paying for the second most important part of the game (having a good, competitive deck).

Overall, really good game gameplay-wise. Feels a bit hard and costly to get a decent deck.

[h1]I recommend it just because you can play draft for free[/h1] which is the biggest part of a cards game, anyway
Great game, just practice drafting for a while then go to keeper draft to open the initial pack so you could choose the card you want. After that sell the expensive one and go make the deck you want to play!!! It's not that expensive if you think of it. only a few cards are expensive. I did draft drow ranger and sell it to make my mono red deck. Recommended
Just wanted to give my 2cents on this game. 

1. Is this a good game?

If you like a card games/board games that requires a high skill decesion making threshold then you will like this game. If you like games like chess, poker, puerto rico, etc you probably will like this. It requires a lot of time learning the mechanics and the cards and you will frequently need to think a few steps ahead and guess your opponent hand. It is brilliant. 

I know a lot of people complaining about the RNG, but all card games and board games have RNG. Even in chess white have a slight advantage. It could have been design better for sure, but what makes the game fun to play is the amount of decisions you need to make despite those badly designed RNG. (hopefully future expantion will have better card RNG design)

2. Is it worth buying?

For a digital TCG/CCG I think it could have been a little cheaper cause there is no printing, but I think its okay. Now a lot of people seem to be complaining about how this is a money scam/grab. Those people have probably not play MTG before, and this game is not for people like you. 

With that said you could actually gain A LOT of free play value from this if you dont mind playing only casual draft games or draft tournaments. There are plenty of content creators that are building communities and regularly (everyday) hosting draft tournaments. And from what I know draft is the more popular format at this point anyway. So for $20 you could play it forever if you dont want to play constructed.

For those that want to play constructed I do think it will be quite cheaper than MTG, which is quite fair IMO. Keep in mind this is a trading card game design by the same person that design Magic the Gathering. Comparing with other F2P model, you are trading an insane amount of time to grind the free cards. And probably wont be able to play multi tier 1/2 decks with F2P in other card games like HS anyway. Casual and social draft mode in Artifact literrally gives you FREE play FOREVER. I dont understand why people are complaining. Draft is super fun.


Interesting card game, great visuals, hard to learn. Definetely worth 20 bucks.

Considering the monetization: Yes, it's not the optimal way to handle it, but comparing it to Hearthstone for example shows, that this is by far the best system in a digital TCG so far. Just wait for the prizes on the steam market to drop and buy your decks for a few dollars.

All in all, I'm happy with the purchase. It's a lot of fun and challenging.
Thank you Valve, very cool!

Draft is very fun and does not require additional money spent to be played. Constructed can be quite expensive, depending on how many decks you want to have.
People complaining about paying for cards have obviously never played a physical TCG. Honestly that's not my biggest problem.

My biggest problem is that it's boring, and not only that but it has an air of inpenetrable complexity (similar to dota a few years ago). This game has amazing potential, I have faith that valve WILL make it good, it's only a matter of time.

I really wish I could rate neutral. I'm rating up, but realize I give this game a 5/10.
This is the best CCG/TCG I have played.

First, this is a card game, if you do not like card games you are unlikely to like this game. Card games in this genre are games like Magic The Gathering, Hearthstone, Gwent, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, SpellWeaver, Soulforge, NetRunner, Legend of the Five Rings and a million other collectible card games that have been created over the last 25 years.

I have had a love/hate relation with TCG/CCGs for the last 20 years but I have always found it a fascinating genre of game and since I sold my MTG collection a few years back I have been looking for the game that satisfies my need for CCGs. I love CCGs for the strategic challenge, the competitiveness, the constant evolving meta, the excitement of learning new cards and combos, the satisfaction of piloting a deck vs tough opponents and coming out on top.

[b] What in my opinion makes Artifact a great game: [/b]
[olist]
[*] Players make strategic choices that matter in game
[*] It is very different from any CCG that has come before it, and I have great trust in Richard Garfield's ability to create great games.
[*] RNG is manageable, lots of small RNG things that to some degree can be mitigated by strategy.
[*] Skill ceiling is really high meaning lots of room for you as a player to grow (maybe not as high as Star Chamber)
[*] Free Casual Phantom Drafts!! this is huge, I could happily play that for a long time!!
[*] Fully built-in marketplace for singles
[*] Built-in player created tournaments! This is great for the future and letting friends run a fun little swiss tournament, or larger organization can do cool stuff, all managed in game!
[/olist]

If you are like me, and like CCGs but feel a bit burned out on Magic and annoyed with the RNG in Hearthstone. Then I think this game is for you.

If you have never played a CCG/TCG well this is a great game to be your first, but be warned TCG/CCGs tend to become all consuming and if you get hooked you will probably not play anything else for some time.

Not buying a Half Life 3 next time. Probably  will have to pay for a crowbar and a happy ending.
End of 2018 update: things turn out pretty well. No more p2w and other stuff. But seasoning still brings some questions about limiting packs/tickets
I love the game and I dont understand the pay to win crybabies its a card game of u play MTG Arena or Hearthstone you have also pay of. This guys want a Free to play Game with the amout of content like witcher 3 without paywalla. Keep it up Valve 

The only thing I wish  is Draft against friends :)
the game mechanics are overall fun and kills brain cells. the rewards for expert mode are good. Theres no point to play casual mode since it doesnt reward anything. Hope there will be a patch that rewards casual modes at least something (not tradable cards).
I FUCKING LOVE THIS GAME.

If HL3 died because of this game. It is the BEST ASSASSINATION EVER. If for this game to have a expansion we need to kill HL3 just leave me alone in a room with HL3. I am going to rape that HL3 ass before and after I kill it.
Although this game seems expensive I can say the monetization scheme is much easier on the player than a game like hearthstone. To make a deck in hearthstone you needed to open 20 bucks worth of packs and hope you get enough dust to craft it Then repeat the process every expansion.  I spent 43 cents crafting a deck in Artifact. That being said the learning curve is much higher than hearthstone and is not tailored to casual players as much. If you are like me and bored of Hearthstone and looking for something new Artifact is definitely worth a shot.
First and foremost: This game is for core TCG / strategy game players. Not casual at all. 

Articat is what an online TCG looks like when it is build with a budget by a world class team of designers, programmers, and artists.

People complaining about high cost are mad they cannot pay for 80 hours to grind out $10 worth of cards, not realizing that the "free to play" mechanics in other card games give you content at a PATHETIC TRICKLE and are DESIGNED TO DRAW YOU IN AND MAKE YOU SPEND LOTS AND LOTS OF $$$. People have already done the math, Artifact looks to be pretty reasonable in terms of cost.

Artifact does not have any free to play mechanics because it attracts botting and abuse in order to grind out cards, which can then be sold for real-world money. It's basically the same model as Magic the Gathering Online.

As a grown-up with a job and more money than time, I welcome the opportunity to be able to play something other than a brain-dead red rush deck without spending hours and hours of my time grinding out cards. I have already played a LOT of card games, I have the skills and knowledge to play a more interesting deck, let me get to the fun part.

Artifact's design is of the quality of Magic the Gathering, blows all other computer-based TCGs out of the water. The client looks fantastic, the couriers look great, and the deck builder and marketplace interface is pretty nice.

RIght now a top-tier constructed deck woulds cost around $60. Compare that to a tournament worthy Magic the Gathering deck. Spend $60 or play 50 hours of Hearthstone and try to build a tournament-worthy deck.
Like any competitive TCG you use money and skill to expand your deck choices. You are presented with 10 packs, 5 event tickets and some starter heroes and items. With this you can have a strong mono or dual deck archtype. I managed to score a great deal of wins in the global ranking sytem. 

What is free and what is not?

FREE - Phantom Drafting, casual constructed & global matchmaking. Featured gamemodes with 6 different deck archtypes to tryout. 5 event tickets to used in any competive environment such as Keeper Draft - where you keep all (60) cards drafted and if you win 3 games you get your tickets back and card pack. The rewards just ramps up. 

NOT FREE - Extra event tickets ($1 USD), card packs ($2 USD). Just like every other competitive TCG. 

If you are a person who counts every single dime of your budget, don't buy it.
If you like to complain instead of having fun, don't buy it. 
If you like to have everything for free or at the Steam Sale, don't buy it.
If you want to earn easy billions from a 20$ investment, buy bitcoins or go forex trading.

Otherwise, launch, relax and enjoy.
Artifcact is an excellent card game that, while monetized, gives you value for money as much if not more than the 60 bucks you'd pay for a triple-a title. Unless you expect free things to come your way, Artifact is worth every penny.
First time ive seen heroes concept in Warcraft 3 translate this well into a card game.

I dont plan to spend money to collect cards, i just play phantom draft and cumulate unopened pack for the future
Artifact is a low cost, high skill card game. Still missing a few features such as spectating but I really enjoy it. There is a lot of depth and pretty much infinite replayabiliy with always having free phantom drafts.
This game is great, complex, and the has the best draft/limited mode of any TCG I've ever played. Most all of the reviews are issues with the pricing model, but in reality the drafting is what's the best thing about Artifact. If you don't want to ever spend money on cards in a card game then stay away from this. But the actual price of cards isn't too bad and will certainly get better over time as more cards get put into the pool, even as prizes from the modes that pay out with packs. It's not a free to play model and valve has been pretty upfront about that, so people bashing and flaming the game really have no reason to. I'd get if they were just leaving reviews to warn others about it, but it seems like a lot of people either didn't do their research or just bought the game to complain about the model. I'd say gameplay is a 10/10 and if you're a big TCG fan it's easily 7/10 even if you don't like the model.
This is truly an innovative card game. I highly recommend it as the gameplay is fresh and unquie. Most negative reviews are just related to monitization and honestly this is much cheaper than hearthstone.
One of the deepest card games I've ever played.  There are a lot of small RNG effects but there are so many and they are so individually non impactful that unless you get grossly unlucky dozens of times in a row you almost certainly lost because of decisions.

For $150 USD I have basically the entire collection minus 4-5 cards that I personally dont care about anyways and its getting cheaper.

If you like thinking in your card games you absolutely cant go wrong with this.
Combining a really well-made artstyle and gameplay direction to a depth of gameplay much further than any TCG, Artifact is definitely a card game to last a long time.
Loving this game. Its fun to play and complex enough to keep from getting stale. As a DotA player I enjoy the familiar and new characters. Personally I don't get all the monetization hate. Its monetized exactly the same as a physical card game. I'd much rather buy into a starter kit and then spend a few cents here and there to round out a deck. Sure its expensive if you want a copy of every single card, but are you really going to use all the cards? Seems like people are just too used to FTP and have to have something to grind for. Can't just play the game for fun I guess.
Fantastic game; a breath of fresh air for digital card games. The market is pretty nice and allows you to grab the specific cards you want, with most of them being very cheap (of course some cards like Axe are a bit more pricey, but that is bound to happen with some cards). Of course if you only want to pay the initial $20, the phantom draft mode is a great option. There is no free progression, but it also has a much cheaper price ceiling than most card games on the market. This is not your typical free-to-play model card game (obviously considering the initial $20 price), and I find it unfortunate that the F2P card game audience is dragging this game through the mud due to its model. The market system, alone allowing you to skip having to try to pull everything from packs, sets this game miles ahead of most of the other digital card games out there for me. 

If you do not mind spending a bit more than the initial $20, or would be content with free drafts without rewards then I would highly recommend this game. It has a good level of depth and feels very unique in comparison to other card games.
Been watching this game on twitch, and picked it up on release day.  It’s very fun once you get a hang of the three lane setup.  Also the free drafts in matchmaking and friendly tournaments is awesome.  There are micro transactions but it comes with free packs.
I was writing a very long review about the game. Then I was thinking what to write more and looked at the review settings, pushed the "Allow Comments" button. The review refreshed and my long review was gone !

Fuck

That's what I think now
It's fun to play against a friend, Also if you are good at the game you can win plenty of cards from expert matches! If you suck at the game like me then you can unlock only a finite amount of cards unless you want to pay for them. But you can build draft decks for free so that's cool! It is without a doupt the best card game out there! I recommend you buy it. It is fun game to kill time with! It's a TCG so the microtransactions are justified!  You don't get same kind of dopamine rush after winning 4 games of expert matches as you would get in others!
As a first time card player. This game is so addicting and quite amazing. Very balanced and you don't have to pay tons of money to play the game especially with draft mode which is going to be the most popular one overall. Casual play you can do everything for free for hours and hours. Global matchmaking, 4-man friend draft, phantom drafts gauntlet, constructed gauntlet...ALL FREE.

We all know if you want to build decks in other cards games it can cost thousands but I can truly say in this if you really want to spend the money to get everything it would cost somewhere between $150-$250 USD if you buy everything in the market place

I have been playing casual mode to learn the game and I have been having a lot of fun, definately see this as a long term game and I will be investing little by little to get all the cards in the game.

The one thing I can pick at is that their is currently no rankings but they did address that it will be coming soon. 

Fantastic card game. Feel free to ask me anything and I will try and get back to you ASAP :)
Don't believe the pay2win claims, the game offers a number of free modes for constructed, draft and tournaments.

Moreso if you put a little extra effort in keeprs draft (the expensive version of draft) and check prices on the cards you pick the game pays for itself and your future drafts.

Very enjoyable so far. While the monetization of the game might be a shock to some to me personally it is quite a welcome after playing boh physical tcgs and lcgs for years. At the moment I have decided to focus on draft which I think in my opinion at least is the premier mode for this game (From what I've played constructed is fun too but I personally feel there are not enough cards in the pool yet for it to properly shine). Other reviews on steam so far seem to state that the monetisation scheme ruins this game but I think if you are mainly interested in the draft format aspect the asking price is definetly worth it.

It is also worth mentioning if you are interested in a cheaper version of constructed there is support to play a "Pauper" format (Common cards only), you can get the entire common pool for a couple of dollars and be competetive for this mode however it does only have support in tournament mode and currently no matchmaking queue for it. (This however could come in the future, valve have stated that modes may rotate/be featured as time goes on.)

Overall I think this game is worth the purchase. It is definetly one of R.Garfield's better games (He's made alot of mediocre ones despite how much people will praise his good ones) and it also very much stands against the other stellar complex deck battle games he's made (Magic, Netrunner and Keyforge too).
Great CCG. You don't need to open packs. The cards can be just bought straight from the market if you're willing to wait for the prices to go down. If not, you can play the free draft modes that give you access to all the cards
Due to all of the criticism this game stirred upon release with its "pay-to-win" system, I hesitated in buying a game that I couldn't wait for after hearing about it a few months ago. What MUST have happened is that all of the people that have never played Magic: The Gathering or any other TCG got upset because you had to pay for cards. Those people are grossly exagerating the cost of this game as it is MUCH cheaper than a physical game such as MTG. I can speak from experience. After looking at the market, I found 2 cards that people keep mentioning: A $25 card and a $15 card. You don't need either of these cards to play the game well and win. All other cards range from $0.05 to a little less than $1. The amount you get up front in card packs is well worth the $20 for the game. The game it self has the most interesting mechanics I have ever seen in a TCG. I could play it for hours and I probably will when I'm off of work each night. 

Bottom line: I almost didn't buy it thinking I was going to be spending hundreds of dollars overall on the game based on reviews and I am SO glad that I did buy the game because damn is it fun.
Great card game, has a lot of depth to it.
It lacks ways to grind cards, but compared to other popular card games, if you decide to spend money, it's way cheaper then anything else. Due to the steam marketplace you can even target specific cards you want. Currently most cards aren't expensive, the most expensive cards being in the ~15 euro mark. Only 2-3 cards come even remotely close to this price tag, so they seem to be outliers when looking at the rest of the cards.
If you don't want to spend money apart from the initial cost there are free game modes to try out. The biggest being phantom draft. 

All in all it's a great game but if you are expecting a f2p title then this game might not be your cup of tea.
I'm a filthy casual at heart. I just wanna have a little fun. I don't want to spend a lot of money, and I really don't want to grind for a digital dopamine hit. I'm looking to play pauper and casual draft. Artifact is perfect for what I want: lots of fun, super flexible and basically free. I bought the base-game, completed my commons collection for pauper and recycled 20 cards for a grand total of $21.93. Had I sold the rares I got in my first 10 packs on day 2, my total net outlay would have been $7.92. For this princely sum, I can play unlimited pauper constructed and casual draft. 

One thing I really like about the system as I start out, is that you can play against any bot deck that you make/import, and Valve starts you out with 7 decent decks to build on. I've played (and liked) a little Gwent, and although I really like CDPR and have heard that they're really generous, it's an easy choice for me. There's no grind at all in Artifact and tons of high-quality gameplay available for next to nothing. Every dev needs to get paid for making a good game, and I'm happy to send Valve a little their way. Just glad it's completely reasonable for such a high-quality game. Not sure if I'm a valve fanboi, but I'll admit to liking the way they do business, and I hope they stay true to their vision for this game.
Game is a lot of fun.  Not sure why there is hate for having to buy card packs to obtain random cards or even buying singles at a market rate.  Every real-world collectible card game works this way.  There are plenty of other free-to-play options out there for people if this model is not for them.  Just goes to show the perception of entitlement that some exhibit.
Great game design. Monetization was a known factor from the beginning and the price point is actually quite fair with marketplace and relative to other ccg/tcg.
Has a great deal of depth many other card games on the market don't offer. The monetization is extremely fair in my experience, as it offers a great streamlined way of getting cards
I haven't played many card games but from what I've played, this seems so much more different and engaging. The 3 lanes make it so much more intense. A lot of back and forth and opportunity to come back.
I love this game so far.

You have to spend money on it like most card games. I don't see why that is such a negative topic.

No one is forcing you to buy new cards.

I have spent a small amount of money (what would normally get me two b land starter decks in irl MTG) and constructed (what I believe to be) two strong decks.

Great mechanics, great animations, no it's not HL3 but thank fuck it's not, the majority of the players would ruin it probably.

Ggwp.
Very nuanced and strategic gameplay that more often than not makes for incredibly close games. Plenty of options for different styles of decks. Really enjoying this.
Game is hard and challenging, also saves your time and rewards you in the long run.

Free drafts are free, but with no reward or ranking system.

Monetization system is best in digital TCG games.

No pay to win. (draft)
Pay to win. (constructed) 

Also there is no grinding for cards, just buy them in market. It's cheap in comparison to other card games.
Constructed is optional and I think least played mode.
Easily the best monitization model of any trading card game out there. No grinding packs and crossing your fingers you get the card you want. Super fun and complex game play.
All card games are designed on a tightrope: mitigating the inherent randomness (RNG) of card draw order, while at the same time taking advantage of the dynamic advantages of that very randomness. 

Artifact designer Richard Garfield's first major card game, Magic: The Gathering (MTG), was and is an admirable effort at achieving this balance through the immense depth of its mechanics, allowing players to leverage their knowledge to overcome RNG. However, the inherent variance of MTG's land system led to many games being decided at the mulligan phase, an unfortunate reality that continues to frustrate players to this day.  

Hearthstone, the first major online CCG success story, threw this balance to the wind with its simple mechanics and multitude of cards containing inherent RNG. The casual nature of this game led to insane popularity, but also frustrated many who wanted an online card game more fit for serious competitive play.

Artifact arrives as just that card game, and it owes much of its quality to a generally excellent approach to RNG. While RNG is abundant in the game through mechanics such as draw order, attack arrows, and the shopping phase, it is rare that the player feels as if their match was decided by a number generator rather than their own play. The reason for this is that Artifact makes up for this randomness by forcing a large amount of meaningful decisions upon the player. Mechanics such as hero placement and handling of initiative give many opportunities for good and, even more importantly, catastrophically bad decisions which, when added up over the course of a full match, allow better players to win far more consistently than in most similar games.

While Artifact deserves general praise for its handling of RNG, there are some black marks on its record in the form of problematic cards. Binary cards, such as cheating death and Bounty Hunter's Jinada ability, not only are often difficult to play around, but are also almost as close to objectively "unfun" as mechanics can get, with one player almost always being left frustrated with their outcomes. However, these frustrations are far outweighed by Artifact's greater success in allowing healthy RNG to maintain a dynamic play experience while also usually feeling fair to both players. It comes with my full recommendation.
Anyone who complains about prices is just a big cry baby, get a job you silly goose!
If you like card games, this will be best you played so far, trust people on that one.
What TCG isnt pay 2 win? People like to make gripes about the monetization of Artifact, but theyre spoiled by free to play garbage. Who really enjoys logging on grinding endlessly for a few packs a week? To not make any true progression towards viable decks, and having playable cards. 

Artifact is the TCG I've been waiting for, as someone who is a fan of competetive TCGs, I've played countless hours of magic, pokemon, yugioh, cardfight vanguard, Chaotic TCG, Hearthstone, the list could go on and on. Ive invested hundreds, thousands of dollars a few of those games. All of these games are REAL money syncs.

Just because a game like hearthstone is free to play does not mean it is f2p friendly. Frankly I believe its just as infriendly as Artifact. The grind to remain relevant as a free to play player is endless and obnoxious. When in Artifact you can invest 40-50 extra dollars and feel like youre in a stable place collection, and deck wise. 

The way packs function in this game is a blessing. I cant imagine how differrent a game like magic would be if you were guarenteed a mythic rare every pack. 

Valve has created an amazing competetive TCG that is affordable and accessible. While the game is not "f2p" friendly I dont think people are really realizing the truth of the matter, its about as f2p friendly as any other TCG. Its only because theres an initial purchase price of $20USD(more in some other countries) that peopel think they can throw a fit. Lets be honest with one another. Is being f2p really fun in a TCG? You spend all your time grinding and grinding then someone with money will just buy tons of packs and already be ahead of you anyway. People would still complain even when valve adds its idea of a progression system. Lets not forget the free options of phantom draft, and casual constructed that are already IN.

Every TCG is p2w. Artifact is a fantastic game that has a very affordable competetive cieling for those who want to ACTUALLY play the game. When valve adds its progression system the crys of poor monetization and p2w will go no where. Sucks to see people have such a negative view on the game just because they dont want to spend money to be relevant.
Just to get it out of the way, i recived this game for free from attending The International 2018 Dota 2 Championship 

I am also a long time dota player, but i am also along time card game player, and Artifact is one of the best card games out there. i put it way above hearthstone and i put it side by side with MTG. Artifact is one of the most deep strategic card games out there and a lot of it has to do with Richard Garfield being a head designer behind it which is a big friggen deal in the CCG scene because well, hes the man who invented the most popular and successful card game out there, Magic The Gathering. There is so much depth to the game and a mountain of new lore if your into the dota universe which is a really cool. and it is by far the cheapest card game out there because you can just buy the cards with out having to constantly buying packs with the hope of getting the card you looking for or having to spend a shit ton of hours on free packs to grind out a competitive viable deck. If you want a good competitive deck you can buy one for around $20. and for those who are saying its P2W or P2P or anything along those matters that is LITERALLY EVERY CARD GAME OUT THERE AND ARTIFACT IS NO DIFFERENT FROM THE REST OF THE CARD GAMES. and for those who say hearthstone you can get free packs just by playing! but you literally have to grind hours upon hours upon hours just to get a mediocre deck. 

So out side of some RNG aspects i give this game a very solid 9/10 and i recommend you giving this game a go if you are into card games.
This game might not be for everyone. The monetization of the game might rub some people the wrong way.

However, this is a great start to a fun and deep card game. In future expansions I'm sure it will only get better.

This is definitely the most strategic card game I've ever played. It's incredibly fun and I'm really loving it. 

The negative reviews make no sense to me and suggest a lack of understanding or snap opinions without actually digging in or thinking about it much. You can draft for free and the game thrives in draft modes. If you need incentive to do well then you can draft for $1 and potentially win prizes.

If you prefer constructed then you can buy just the cards you need from other players. That's game changing. It costs way more to build a deck in Hearthstone than it does in Artifact. Additionally, the cards you buy don't become worthless like other online card games since you can always sell them.

Finally, the reason why they can't have a way to earn free cards (at least not yet) is because you can't have a card marketplace for trading/buying/selling cards if cards are entering the economy for free. Cards would have no value if they kept entering the economy for free. Eventually maybe they can offer just commons or cards from older sets as cards you can earn for free. For now though it doesn't make sense to give cards away.

That all being said....you guys killed the game by not putting in ways to earn packs or event tickets by just playing the game. Sure, it's because people are dumb and cheap and greedy...but you should know that about people.

Edit: Now the crybabies get free cards.
This game is just like any card game: You get to buy the booster packs / cards. So I dont know why the whole community is complaining + You get 10 Free Boosterpacks in game + a Free Dota Plus and I think that is worth the price of the game already. The feature where you earn booster pack is missing right now, but there is a high chance that that feature will be implemented in the future. Nice Game all in all!
The best card game I've played in a long time. Great game design, great visuals and sounds, great economy that is not predatory in the least. Thank you Dr. Garfield.
One awesome game. Much better than HS. Blizzard right now is one arbitrary company. They try to feed gamers to eat shit.

1. The average cost for each card is much cheaper than HS.

2. Actually, if we know how to play this game, most of games will be end before 8th round, like 15-20mins.

3.Artifact just like dota2, you need to spend sometime to be good at it.
A lot of fun. Solid card game with a lovely theme, tons of depth and immense potential in a very polished package.

Some may be turned off by the monetization model, but personally, I don't mind it at all.
Probably the best card game I've ever played.

As of right now though, I don't care to play so much as it feels stake with no seen MMR or Ladder. 
I will probably play more and invest more once those come out.

There is endless free draft modes which is amazing.
I can tell the company knows how to design a game first before the polish, eager to see this game in the coming years
This game is amazing.  Way more fun than any other card game and I've played most of them, including magic, hearthstone, eternal, Gwent, and netrunner.  Richard Garfield knocked this one out of the park.
Genuinely fun tcg. It only has mixed reviews from being a new Valve game that isn't HL3, along with some misinformation on how some of the different modes work.
Edit: now made even better from progression and free packs!
Our group is loving this game.  We are all glad Valve added private tournaments, my friends and I have had a great time running swiss draft tourneys amongst ourselves.  I am really hoping to see a growing community around the private draft tournaments.
Subtle, deep, and tactically and strategically rewarding, Artifact is one of the most skill intensive card games to date. The game offers a myriad of decisions, from where to deploy your heroes, to which spells you cast, to where you play your creeps, to which opposing threats you choose to prioritise, to knowing if and when you should sacrifice a lane for greater success... and every single one of them can matter. From decks built around beefy brawlers, to cunning rogues, to resilient supporters and fragile mages, you can find a playstyle and strategy that suits you.

The economy is one of the best yet for an online card game. Yes, it's not FTP, but FTP games usually need hours upon hours of painful and joyless grinding to get anywhere. The removal of a need to grind and the availability of a free market means that most cards are only a few cents apiece, and even solidly good heroes are less than a dollar, and it's thus easy and efficient to build the deck you want compared to dust based systems of other card games. This market rewards players who want to explore niche decks, heroes and strategies.
Amazing card game with extreme complexity enabling 200 IQ plays by none other than Dr. Richard Garfield of Magic the Gathering fame set in the universe of Dota 2. i'm ready for it to ruin my life similar to how Dota did 8 years ago. Truly recommended.
Decent game.
Needs more social features.
Pretty cheap, unless you're from a third world country.
Best mode is free to play anyway (Casual Phantom Draft).
Hopefully they tone down the RNG and reduce game length.
Do you like drafting in MTG or Hearthstone Arena? They've recently added a casual draft mode that feels great to play, but constructed costs a bit to get into. 

Artifact scratches that itch of playing multiple games at the same time, while only playing one game. 

9/10
Incredibly intricate and engaging. RNG exists but skill is overwhelmingly more important. Matches are so close and tense that it's rare that you can sit back and relax -- the tides can turn very quickly, especially when killing opposing heroes isn't always good. Don't play this game unless you want to think :P
This game is done really well. Valve is trying to build a fan base that cares for the game. That's why it isnt another f2p game. They want players that have something invested in the game. Even if you never open a pack or spend another dime you can play limitless draft games at no disadvantage whatsoever. Mobile game have ruined people. The only reason these other f2p games put in ways to grind out cards is to get you to think, "this sucks, I'd much rather gamble and try to get the cards i need by throwing money". To me, this system seems better because it doesnt hide behind abusive gambling tactics and allows you to buy and SELL cards you don't want or need. If some of you could think slightly out of the box you would understand and realize its cheaper to get a full set than any other digital card game on the market.
Pros:
Tier 1 cards going for .09-.47 on the market (with the exception of one Rare red hero)
Free casual draft mode
Best overall card game mechanics I have played
Free player created and driven tournament system
Recycle cards for competitive play tickets
Sell cards you don't want
Free Pre-constructed gauntlet

Cons:
$20 initial, non refundable once you open your $20 of packs after doing the tutorial
No Ladder/MMR System (in house leagues via the free tournament system could change my view on this)
No free competitive/draft
I did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I have been. I've been playing for a few hours now with constructed decks based on the initial cards I got and having a blast. I expected the game to be intimidating but the tutorial is fast and effective. The game makes a lot of sense once you try it out and it's kept me coming back in a way that other card games have not.

Also played a phantom draft tournament with friends and it was extremely fun.
Bought it in spite of all the negative reviews being posted by people that are bad at math, or didn't read what this game was supposed to be and reviewed the game based on that instead of the gameplay. The gameplay is actually pretty good.
Every time I win I feel like the world's smartest human, a genius deigning to play video games with the masses. Every time I lose I feel like the dumbest person to ever use a keyboard and mouse. Artifact is great.
This is probably the best card game ever designed. As an aspiring game designer, everything has been made exceptionally well with attention to detail. The pricing seems to bother some people, but they should not be expecting Hearthstone! This is a different game and is actually cheaper to get a full collection. In regard to the actual game, the innovations of 3 lanes, Heroes, gold and items, and a turn system that is richer than Hearthstone and better for digital than MTG; these are AMAZING innovations that will take time for people to really understand. I look forward to spending many hours playing this game in the future!
SUPER in-depth strategy. FREE draft competitions. No forced daily login grind (compared to other collecting games).
... but I'm most impessed with the voices and sounds, amazing!
Well thought out game.  I got a free copy from attending a Dota tournament.  

I really enjoy it so far - plenty of free content despite some of the other reviews.
This game's depth is so much more than any other card game. The constant back and forth makes it feel more like an RTS, which is different but great.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a challenging "card" game that departs from the norm.
The game is great, like many others have said. If thats what you are worried about, you should be fine. As for the monetization that everyone is complaining about, I love it. Packs are cheap (dont recomend buying them though), and the $20 price tag gets you more than $20 worth of cards. Not to mention, you get access to featured game modes, like the current one that lets you try out multiple decks with rare cards to see what kind of playstyle you want. Plus, you get unlimited free drafting in the phantom draft. No rewards, but you could play it infinitely, and ignore the rest of the game, and it would be worth the price tag. But best of all, is the market place. As someone who can't and doesn't want to grind every day for trickles of gold to then buy packs with low chances of getting a legendary, the ability to just buy cards on the market place is phenominal. Hell, for $100, including the starting $20, you could probably buy a complete collection. In any other CCG (HS, MTGA), you get enough to maybe play 2-3 meta decks, or 1 expensive control deck. Time is money, and the time it takes to get things in the F2P games and their lootboxes, you get ripped off. Here, I can spend some money, build super cheap decks ($20-$30 Max, plus expensive staples which are the majority of the cost are 1 ofs and go in a ton of decks). Buy the cards you want, and save time you would spend grinding in other games. Enjoy the game, rather than slugging through every daily. 

To the people who say that this game's monetization is unfair, I say you don't value your time enough. The hours you spend grinding in F2P and gacha games is exponentially higher than what Artifact charges you. The difference is that Artifact is upfront with what it charges you, while other F2P hide behind loot boxes and daily grinds.
If you feel that your time is more valuable than what in-game grinding pays out in any given f2p game, you can safely ignore the complaints about the monetization strategy.

The draft mode is very fun & strategic. Recommended for anyone who enjoys draft/arena modes in other card games.
Complex card game with a free draft mode so you don't have to pay boatloads of money or boatloads of time to have boatloads of fun. 

Each turn of each lane has so many decision you could make with items, activated abilities, lane priority, etc. that make you win with skill not just because you drew well and ramped Mana well.
Pros
- Incredible Skill Cap
- Fair Monetization, especially when compared to other CCGs/TCGs
- Free Gamemodes
- Free friend tournaments
- Uniqueness from other (Lanes, Items, etc.)

Cons
- Bugs
- Still P2P for constructed

Neutral 
- Paying for the game

Overall, in the few hours I've played, this is much more addictive and fun than other CCGs I've played. The mere fact that you can draft for FREE an unlimited number of times is incredible. If you enjoy FNM drafting or just enjoy CCGs in general, play this game. The constructed prices aren't particularly bad, but when Valve promissed this game to be free-to-play and now costs 20$ merely for the game itself, it leaves a small sour taste in your mouth. 

TL:DR If you like drafting, buy it, otherwise research more
Negative reviews seem to be mostly due to a common misunderstanding of basic economics. People are bitching about this being a "money vacuum". That's untrue. This is a free-to-keep-playing game with a base investment of LESS THAN $20. The game "forces" you to buy 10 packs at the beginning (pack is $2, game is $20, you do the math). But guess what: open the packs and SELL SOME OF YOUR CARDS. There are plenty of bagholders who love the game and will buy your cards. Suddenly your purchase cost less than $20. Congrats!

What about continued investment? Games aren't free to make. Servers aren't free to run. So first off, all these fucks are just expecting shit they aren't owed. These reviews reek of entitlement. I'm happy Valve made the game cheap, and even happier that I CAN GET AWAY WITH ONLY PAYING BASE COST, because Valve included a free, unlimited draft mode. Seriously, what the fuck are people complaining about?

BTW, yes, the game is fun. Few minor annoyances ("forced surrender" notification spam lol). But nice job! Game development done well.

Disclaimer: I received this for free because I bought a Steam controller a while back. That invalidates NOTHING about the economics I outlined above. If you think otherwise, get used to being wrong. But don't accept you're wrong; you might hurt yourself.
I recommend this game. Don't look at not recommend comment. Most of them are not buy this game.

In this game, I can learn how to build a card, make some decision, and most important thing, how to win this game with create great strategy.

Recommended for you who want to spent time for build strategy, and not recommended for you who have not enough wallet, and say this game is literally p2w.
For those complaining about money : this is just like real TCG (MtG, Yugioh, Pokemon), you get cards either from buying packs or buying them from someone else via the market. Sure you are going to spend money on cards but you can get them back by selling the cards. You get 10 packs for the initial $20 for the game which is the same price, basically the same as you buying 10 packs of cards to start playing Yugioh. If you want to grind endlessly for all the cards you need and spend a lot of time (or spend a lot of money), go play other online card games. If you want to have freedom in buying and selling cards just like real TCGs, play Artifact
Oh nooooo!  All those people used to having cards fall in their lap and are worth nothing now have an actual card game to deal with!

Awesome game so far.  The card economy is great and its awesome to have cards that have value again.  I'm glad Valve teamed up with Garfield on this cause MTG was/is great.  

Initial $20 is a great deal considering that most starter packs for actual card games would run you ~$20 for just 1 pack.  I am really looking forward to where this game goes once people stop complaining about having to pay for cards like you are supposed to in a card game.  The free model for card games were too grindy.

Keep it up and good luck.
A fantastic game, and the future of digital card games.

The game respects your time, which is something other games dont do, allowing you to grind for 0.25 worth of 'free' content per hour, meanwhile encouraging you to build a collection of cards that will forever be tied only to that g ame, conditioning the player and exploiting the sunken cost fallacy.

A $20 start pack here gets you unlimited free draft content, and access to the singles market, where you can build top tier competitive decks for less than an expansion pre-order of other games, that will leave you at the whim of the cards in the packs, maybe you'll even get 3 legendaries!

The goblin auctioneer tried to warn everyone "Time is money friends"
The best designed new card game in years. There is no free grind, instead the market allows very cheap building of your collection compared to any other CCG.

To clarify, after you pay the intro $20 (for which you get $25 of ingame rewards) you can still play constructed and draft for free. But you can't earn cards for free. You don't really miss it though because you just pay cents per card on the market.
The free casual draft mode is well worth the $20. Most cards seem to be pretty cheap too so getting into constructed doesn't seem to be as big of a wall as it is in other card games.
So far, so good. The decks can certainly be a bit expensive, but they don't seem to advertise phantom draft casual, which lets you effectively play the exact same Phantom Draft that you need a ticket for, you just won't get any rewards no matter how well you do. Been grinding that and it's been a solid time. Constructed really doesn't seem to be too stifled by the potential pay to win-ness. I haven't really been encountering too many "oh-so-op" decks with all rares or some nonsense. I think all heroes, with certain luck, can be insanely OP.
i dont usually like or play these kinds of games but this one is so fun, well-designed and polished that i still think it's totally worth the price. it does away with a lot of the BS that causes me to dislike games in this genre usually. the speed of the game, the RNG and the level at which you have to strategize/play well is great

really looking forward to see where it goes from here. would like to see a couple cards reworked (even more pre-decision RNG and balance would be great, even though it's already at a good level) and i know that peolpe are looking forward to a ranking system (which valve has already said is a high priority). would be great if you there was a social draft as well

also, i'm not necessarily a fan of DotA (even though i think it's a neat game)... but i have to say that the IP works fantastic here and i love the overall presentation
Amazing graphics, even better sound!
Engaging gameplay where you have to think about every move you make!
Great and innovative mechanics and ruleset!

The game itself is great, about all the complain for the pricing, there is market where all common/uncommon are under $0.25 except blink dagger. All the rares are very special but I think the best part is draft mode and it can cost nothing to zero. All the rares are not game decider. 

Cons: no much social element except tournament 
          no progression,


Game:
- Game play is very fun
- No progression without paying money.
- A lot of mechanics are not explained well in game and take a while to get used to
- Game is a little expensive, but you could get lucky with your initial card packs and be able to pay for the game selling the cards you get.

Wants:
- Small rewards. Like maybe 1 event ticket for participating/doing well in each month's call to arms
- MMR for matchmaking and maybe win rate or some other form of stat tracking for your different decks
- A way to be able to play the draft mode with friends, instead of having to create an in house tournament with 4 players

Right now for someone who does not want to spend money every time they want to play or to buy cards, the game is like playing unranked DotA 2, except without any stat tracking or earning of cosmetics or interacting with other people. Its fun, but not for everyone. You need to treat this game like a physical trading card game or it may not meet your expectations.
The game reminds me of a better digital MTGO (Magic the Gathering Online).  Events cost money to enter.  Decks cost money to make.  However there is a lot of depth to the game and you can get basically all the commons and uncommons for pretty cheap.  There are free game modes, but you need a deck to play in them (obviously).

So if you liked or didn't mind MTGO, you will probably like this game.  If you really don't want to spend any money than you probably want to play another digital TCG.
Sure, they ask money alot, but some of them are necesarry to maintain some of the gamemodes, other than that, really had fun playing this game, if you are interested in card games and like to play it time to time, I would recommend it, even if you are a casual player.
Game is cheap by TCG standards, gameplay is excellent, RNG is there but if you're good it means little over the course of a match. The market tax (15%) is standard for Valve marketplace, but feels high considering packs/keys are Valve first party anyway. Beyond that, a lot of the cards are still cheap, with only a few extreme exceptions (Axe, Drow Ranger). It's perfectly viable to build a cheap but effective deck. And that's ignoring the free phantom draft mode.

TL;DR: Game's a tcg, judge it's cost compared to Magic. Gameplay good. RNG not oppressive. Buy recommended.
First impressions:

Wowie. I will get lost in this game just as badly as I did Dota 2 itself. And, whattya know, it's a card game, and I happen to really like them.

I'm not too worried about this card pack fiasco, but I will say that I do hope I can build fun decks without *actually* having to deal with too many lootboxes...

And I do have something to say to Valve specifically: Don't be decietful to us again. The $20 price tag is nothing more than the price for the "Starter Pack" bundle. Market your game as such or else shit will reach higher water than you've already got yourselves in.
I would definitely recommend this game. For $20, you get a base set, 10 packs, and 5 arena tickets. Plus, you can play modes forever, like phantom arena and casual constructed, absolutely for free. The paid versions of those modes with tickets and your own decks, seem very fairly priced.
I don't have a lot of money and I won't be getting a huge collection of cards any time soon. And honestly, for $20 I am more than pleased. Phantom drafts and playing with my friends is more than enough for me at that price. I would way rather pay for better decks or just play with my collection, than spend hours grinding out crafting currency in yet another CCG. 

(People complaining about individual card prices are being silly, wait for the market to stabilize guys!)
For people who say this game is a scam are the same people who only play ftp card games and not cardboard. This is essentially a physicall card game on digital so ofc it has a price tag. You can sell the cards as well as buy them which yes is a turn off to most ftp players sure but every game has whales and mtgo still has people pay to play it so if you want a free to play experience go play HS and grind for days to get a card rather than just pay to play. There is no reason to be negative about a card game being pay to play as they have always been for the longest time so this is nothing new, 

There are issues with the card design like Drow ranger and Axe just being incredibly powerful and everything else just existing alongside them but that is a card design problem that can be fixed HOPEFULLY. Just reminds me of scarab god every god dam game you will see 1 of them cause they are so stron what is the point of playing a deck without them. Also ther is very little synergy with cards which kind of feels weird and makes building decks around control or aggro weird. Like black has a lot of kill cards but also is aggro???? and there really isnt anthing to play late game unless you are red or blue cause the green high cost cards just die instantly to black cards. The % hit mechanics are not a good thing to have in a game because it leaves 1 player happy and another angry every time. Make it so its likea  once per turn or something but this kind of rng is really anoying and very unfun for 1 player at all times.  

So yah thats my rant, after reading this horrible comment section full of FTP whiners who just complain they cannot play for free but probably still buy packs in those games regardless. DO NOT PLAY THIS if you want a free to play experience end of story move on and enjoy your life of hatred. This game is not a scam it is cardboard to digital deal with it.
Fantastic. Been playing hearthstone, Eternal, MTG arena and all the other card games. 

This is very different and I love it. It not only demands your attention it requires it. One turn where you don’t pay attention can cost you the game. 

I love the economy. Just it costs money, but you can get a decent collection or deck for under $10.
I'm writing this primarily to inform any misinformed people about the monetization or how one should approach this game.  Hopefully it can help people who already have the game start out in it properly and continue to play or give insight to interested parties 

If you've played physical MTG, the monetization of this game is no surprise to you. You can buy a pre-constructed deck and play all you want in constructed events or with friends($20).  This game is no different except that there's free phantom draft OR paid in expert with stakes(pay a ticket with the chance of winning it back with the possibility of packs if you win 4 or 5 games out of the draft set).

In Artifact you can do either, draft for free in casual phantom(the main free mode in this game and what you should aim for to start learning until you get multiple perfect runs.  That's when you'll know you have the hang of things).  

Then you can move to expert draft where if you win at least 3 games in your draft set you get your tick back.  4 or 5 wins nets you packs, so if you're good, you gain.  This is where you grind packs if you're good and you can infinitely do so.  

Keeper draft is where you use a set of 5 of your packs to draft into powerful cards within colours you choose to go towards your collection(do this to steer your colllection towards what you want to build first in constructed.. if constructed even appeals to you).

You craft draft in player-created tournaments with friends or people you find in discord.  There are already many pauper(common card), Uncommon, draft, and constructed tournaments that you don't have to pay for that have packs and money for prizes.

In closing, it's honestly a very enjoyable and deep game.  Easy to learn, hard to master - bit of a learning curve.  Can be extremely strategic.  If you go into the game knowing the proper information, you will have  a much better time.  The negative reviews are from people that don't understand how tcgs(digital or not) work.  You have sets of cards that come out, packs.  You buy into the set with packs to draft or just open for fun or wait and pick up singles if you want to play constructed.  Simple.  Enjoy!
Yes, you should know what you are getting into in terms of money.  If you don't know how this works, learn before you buy it and then complain.

As far as the actual gameplay goes... it's kind of complicated and slow so it might not hook you right away.  But as you get more into it, it's extremely complex and deep.  And heavily skill based.  It really does seem like an excellent game.
The core gameplay is very fun and not as difficult as it is to watch. The drafting mode is a really welcome change and I love the fact I can actually buy and sell individual cards instead of throwing absurd amounts of money at packs. There is a really nice sense of polish and attention to detail as far as look and feel. The music is also really good. Honestly I'm more curious about the future of the game. I'm hoping for more game modes.
Best Card Game Ever.!! The complexity of Gameplay is addictve as Hell

Don't believe in the complaint. Just try it yourself.

For 20 bucks you get 10 packs of card, so literally, the game is Free!!

After that you can play casual Draft or Draft tournament forever!!

++ Gameply
++ Addictive

-- No ranking, not just the ladder, I mean no "tournament ranking" (yet)


Incredible game with great gameplay and mechanics, sadly being held back by Valve's questionable monitesation of the game. I'm still going to recommend it because its very fun, but if you're not willing to shell $20 To keep up every month or so I wouldn't recommend it.
[h1] Holy Moly. It's so polished [/h1]

While many reviews seem to be bothered by the costs that theres micro-transactions there game gives you opportunities to make your money back (atleast in steam-cash). I went ahead and played keeper draft. While i lost my tickets for good, the cards i could keep could [b] make my investment back. [/b]

The gameplay is one of the most polished ones i have seen so far in a card game. However the learning curve is incredibly steep and the first set of cards is a bit small in my opinion.

Also: If you just looking to play limited formats (like phantom draft), you can do that for free. However the 'Ranked' experience costs 'entry ticket'. You can earn plently in the base-pack since you can keep recycling commons from the boosters included in the game. You can go infinite if you manage to get 3wins before you get 2losses consistently.
the definition of easy to play, hard to master. This is a great game. I know there is a lot of debate around the pricing and at the end of the day people need to make their own decision, but it's worked out well for me. $20 gets me enough cards to play with, some tickets, infinate phantom draft and I can buy the cards I need for a competitive constructed deck in the market place with no gambling. I would like to see a mmr/progression system implemented to casual, which is something the devs have said they are working on. 

The gameplay is slick and fluid, I love the card art and each game is suprisingly different. The tension between going all in for a fountain vs winning two lanes makes the games really exciting. 

All in alll, worth the 20 bucks
I don't understand the negitiave reviews, i love this game. Seems like alot of the reviews are based off launch day and didn't get their packs ASAP. 

Cards on the market place are cheap if you want certain cards (except AXE and KANNA, because they are rare). which makes a deck you want cheaper rather than buying packs if that is not your thing.

Try it for yourself.
Like hearthstone or MTGA but with a fully open economy to buy and sell cards so you aren't fucking hosed buying packs to get dust to eventually get a card.
This the best digital tcg on the market currently. Many people are complaining about the pay model. Its not pay to win, its presented like a traditional tcg, such as mtg. With this model you can buy and sell cards for steam money. This means you can buy your dream deck immediatly instead of praying a pack eventually gives it to you.
Solid card game, it has the complexity of MTG while being designed to be good for digitial. It has good depth so far, and will only increase as new sets are released. 

I prefer this to the F2P modle, I appreciate being able to buy singles instead of grinding for packs. Straight to the point.
There are a lot of people comparing this game's monetization model unfavourably to that of Hearthstone and other digital CCGs such as Gwent or MTGA. If that's your baseline, and you like how those games  function, then I can see why you might draw that conclusion.

However, I believe there is room to argue that the "free-to-play" model is far from perfect. Yes, Hearthstone is technically free to play, but it definitely isn't free to compete. Having sunk hundreds of hours into that game, mostly playing ladder, I can unequivocally say that it is necessary to spend money to keep up with the metagame, let alone to play multiple top-tier decks. Hearthstone-like "free-to-play" models mostly exist to funnel you towards the cash shop, and to provide grinding incentives that keep you playing even if the gameplay itself isn't always exciting.

Artifact's model is very different. By making the cards digital objects that can be bought and sold, Valve are basing this game on a traditional paper TCG model, which has some benefits and some downsides. The major downside is that you are required to buy into the game initially, rather than being nudged towards spending money later. However, this is mitigated slightly by the fact that if you decide you aren't a fan, it's possible to sell your collection and turn some of your money back into Steam credit, which you can spend on other games. In a standard digital CCG, any money spent is gone--short of selling your account (and potentially violating the game's ToS), you aren't getting anything out.

The other main downside, that you can't "earn" anything by playing, is also arguably less of a problem than it might appear at first--in theory, your time in Artifact will be motivated by how fun Valve can make their actual gameplay, not by how effective of a Skinner box it is. The lack of a sense of progression is a definite issue, but perhaps one that comes down to player preference.

The major benefit of Valve's model is that you can directly buy the cards you want on the Steam marketplace. This is huge: rather than gambling on pack openings or farming crafting materials, you can see how much a card costs and then decide if you need it. In Artifact, you know exactly what your money will get you--a system that, if managed right, has the potential to be much more respectful of the player's time and finances than other digital card games.

Lastly, I want to mention the inclusion of the free casual phantom draft mode, which i believe is a massively underrated feature and was a major factor in my decision to buy into the game. The objective of draft in most other card games is to break even on resources to keep drafting and "go infinite"--here, after your initial buy-in, you get that as a given. Even if you buy the game, crack your packs, sell all the cards and only play casual draft without ever spending more money, I think this is a game worth looking into, if you are at all interested in card games or strategy games generally.
Early days so this is just an initial review:

* This game is far more complex than I initially gave it credit for.
* It's truly a trading card game, where you can buy singles you need rather than opening packs endlessly.
* There is no opportunity to grind, so I'm not competing with people who have too much time on their hands.
* I can be playing a competitive deck day 1 for around $20 on top of buying the game. (Believe it or not, you don't NEED Axe or Drow Ranger.)
Initial impressions. You should try this game out if you are at least 1 of 2 people.

Person 1) A person who usually ends up spending quite a bit on card games. It's cheaper to get a full set in this game compared to Hearthstone, and you can cash out if you don't want to play anymore.

Person 2) A drafting fiend whose favorite format in card games is limited. You can draft for free as many times as you like after buying the game.
Great game.
This is basically a math game, but god damn does it have a sexy way of playing out. I don't believe that microtransation are as bad in the games current state.
The economy system is just fine and the game is absolutely amazing. By far the deepest and most strategically minded card game currently available. Not a very casual or easy game whatsoever, absolutely recommend to any hardcore or competitive card game fan.
Really enjoying this so far. The basic mechanics are easy to pick up, especially if you play other card games, but I can already tell there's so much strategic depth. That said, it's also quite fun to just play casually with buddies.

A lot of people are complaining about the cost of getting cards, but it seems cheaper than most collectible card games, plus you can play unlimited casual phantom drafts for free.
This game isn't for everyone. The monetization system isn't common to find-

But it is for the best. The gameplay is unique, different, engaging, and difficult. Some people will hate this game. If you don't like super in-depth strategy and a game where the sum of 30 different decisions determine the outcome, this game isn't for you. If you want to spend hours thinking about a single turn you made, or discussing it with others, then this game is for you. If you want an economy that isn't based around lootboxes and daily rewards, but is instead based around events and tournaments, then this game is for you.

I'm rating it a 5/5 stars. There are a lot of negative reviews about the game. Reynad, a popular card game player said it best: Hearthstone is a game that was designed to be a 7/10 for everyone. Artifact is either going to be a 2/10 or a 10/10. Even as a f2p player, I'm enjoying the grind. I'm continually learning from my mistakes. Every game you realize how deep it goes.


Love this game, great monetary system.  F2p games are predatory and clearly Valve is trying to avoid that while still making money.  For $20 you get access to every.single.card. right from your first game in the free draft mode.  What other TCG does that?  It takes people YEARS to unlock everycard for free in hearthstone.  This will be a great game to play inbetween Dota games. Thanks Valve ily
An excellent game from valve in its early form. I find myself losing track of time in these matches. Played for 5 hours and it felt like only 1. Time flies when you're having fun. I look forward to the game evolution. 

When you start off the game they give you 5 tickets for ranked play, 2 decks worth of cards to mess with, and 10 free packs (100 cards) which is more than I can say most OTCGs give. The amount of people surprised that you have to buy packs....like in real life TCGs....is pretty astonishing and considering how that's 50% of the reviews I would pretty much ignore them.

Despite what everyone says you can get packs for free in ranked. It takes 3 out of 5 wins in ranked to get a free pack if you cant afford to get any or just dont want to pay for them. 
Be good at the game and get free packs.

This game is so balanced that even if people do buy specific cards from auction it wont matter. I've lost to plenty of people who were using starter decks with my heavily customized decks.
lots of hate being flung around.

Artifact will cost you less in the long run over Hearthstone or MTG. The market for buying and selling cards is without a doubt the easiest and most convenient method for card acquisition out of all the E card games.

The game play is highly intriguing, and features game mechanics never before seen in a card game.

Kudos Valve, kudos.
people are idiots if they think they are gonna have to be selling their car to afford a deck, let alone the entire decklist. This game does not provide any avenues to earn cards beyond the inital packs you get, however, the steam marketplace integration is extremely good. I love this game because the first deck I wanted to make was silly and very uncompetitive. It cost me 5 dollars to assemble from the marketplace on the day of release and I went into the global matchmaking game and won my first game handily against a deck with an Axe, at the time worth around 23$. In comparison, back when I played Hearthstone I wanted to make a mill rogue deck. I grinded, and dusted all the cards so I could make a playset, had fun for a bit then realized that if I wanted to make any other deck I would have to shell out for a shitload of packs or grind for months. I would be able to sell my silly deck in Artifact for less than I bought it for, sure, but I would have the freedom to sell parts of my collection and be able to obtain the cards I actually want the fastest. F2P is a trap, Artifact has a much fairer economy than most other games on the market (RIP Eternal).
Artifact is the cheapest Trading Card Game thus far, has mechanical depth and complexity that is on par with Dota, and is all in all a very well-thought game. Totally worth $20, no matter who you are.
SELL YOUR CARDS

If you sell your starter cards, you can make any type, even close to top teir decks!

With all the negative reviews because of the "Cost of cards", they fail to understand
the market value of cards, saying things like "IT'S $250 TO MAKE A DECENT DECK" 
I own the best deck atm, it costed me forty dollars, Pricy sure, but as a previous
Hearthstone player, I can promise you that's nothing!!!
You can even fill in the other cards, and build one close to it for a couple dollars earned 
from the inital cards you get!?!?!?!

I really dont like all the negative reviews this game has recieved based on estimates given 
from beta testers/Ill informed players, PLEASE, GIVE IT A TRY.
After i played 2 tutorial matchs with bot the game was crashed and i can’t launch the game to play anymore. Idk how to fix like it’s bug for only my id. I sent my problems to steam contact but no answer at all. So sad
Having played a whole lot of Magic the Gathering (both physical and the new arena) as well as Hearthstone, this game seems by far the most generous!  Sure, it isn't free to play, but a competitive deck in either Magic or Hearthstone could cost you hundreds of dollars to acquire the right amount of dust/wild cards.

In Artifact, just put together your deck, buy the cards you need, and spend maybe $20.  This plus the $20 you spent to buy the game... you've still yet to spend the price of a AAA title and can play competitively!

Beyond that, there are plenty of free modes.  You can draft casually for free endlessly, which gives you the ability to use all the cards at some point and is by far the most fun of all the formats!

The game itself is full of depth and richness, and I am having an absolute blast.  The RNG elements always come with the ability for you to respond to them, adding a layer of depth that doesn't just feel like RNG is killing your very soul.
Probably one of the best TCGs I've played hands down. Coming from MTG, FoW, Yugi and others, I'm confident this is a game that will be around for a long, long time.
Highly polished CCG with the ability to fill in missing cards from your collection via the Market. Still playing just the Gauntlet, but I'm really, really enjoying it. Can't wait to see how the community around the game develops.
Fun and interesting experience, but it's not very rewarding. This review was written one day into release so take this with a grain of salt.

Pros:
- Excellent visual and sound design, feels amazing to play from the sounds and visuals alone
- Hard to learn and harder to master, but every game always feels like a test of skill, and it feels extremely rewarding to outplay your enemies
- The way the economy of the game is set up makes is to that unlike other card games, if you want a card you just buy it off the market directly, and you can sell any cards you don't want, and the main benefit to this is that money you make from the game goes right to your steam wallet. It feels very organic to interact with a free market presented in the game.
- The mechanics are creative, unique, and incredibly intuitive, and every card has a purpose and a role, building decks feels great and making magic happen with them feels even better.

Cons:
- There's no real ranking system or leagues, and there's no real progression. You just sort of play the game, and with a hidden MMR you get matched with people or are more or less as good as you are.
- There are some balance issues with a few of the cards, and while just about every card and get countered, it can sometimes feel just unfun when the odds are completely stacked against you because the enemy is loaded with extremely powerful cards.
- Currently playing Artifact is a kind of lonely experience, you can't add people from in-game after you play against them, and you can really only host private games and tournaments from people on your friends list.

I will update this review as more updates come out, but so far this is a solid and recommended TCG experience.
Amazing online TCG that puts other online card games to shame with its incredible depth and intricacies of gameplay. Also brought in a fresh TCG concept to the online community, a true blue TCG instead of the many online CCGs that currently plague the market. Also, phantom draft modes (both casual and expert) allows players to play endlessly with cards they don't even own.
It's good, the money part also good. It may look like a cash grabber, but if the player has discipline and skill and awareness, he can earn prettty much all of the cards and decks. Pretty good for some off-Dota competitive play :) Also, a good deck is not too expensive and comparing it to real paper cards, a lot easier to handle and obtain.
Fantastic game. Anybody who says this is a predatory game blocked by multiple pay walls is a moron who has never played or is a kid who's parents won't fork out the $20usd to play. There is no need to grind your life away to collect cards. People talk about never putting money into a game and grinding for months and years to achieve collections. I mean if that's your thing go for it. But for the rest of us who have little time, it costs less than a days work to have a fully functional top teir deck. So you can spend hundreds of unpaid hours playing a game like HS for cards. Or pay about $40-$60usd for a tier 1 deck.  

Or you could do none of those things, and just play free phantom drafts and tournaments with your friends and other communities. Just in case your missed this or don't understand > THIS IS FREE TO DO! YOU HAVE ACCESS TO ALL CARDS IN PHANTOM DRAFT YOU JUST CAN'T KEEP THEM. 

IF YOU WANT TO GET SERIOUS AND TRY BECOME A PRO OR SOMETHING. IT WILL COST YOU ABOUT $150 FOR THE ENTIRE SET (IF THAT MUCH) OF 310 CARDS . MUCH BETTER THAN GRINDING FOR WEEKS AND MONTHS OR FORKING OUT HUNDREDS FOR RANDOM PACKS IN THE HOPE OF PULLING SOMTHING. SUCH AS IN PTCG/HS/GWENT/EVERY OTHER PVP CARD GAME.
Let me just open by saying the concerns over monetization may be a bit hyper - critical 

  The whole point that valve wanted to avoid dishing out tons of cards for free is that , for One as you can see there are currently fewer total number of cards in the roster than other modern card games , for Two there isn't even a typical scheme of ' Mythical , Legendary ' etc. but as of now a normal deck just consists of common and rare cards , 

  Three and this is the major point , because every card can be fluidly bought and sold on the market [ which allowed me to get what i needed for one very good deck after spending only 20 $ ] then all of the cards would inevitably lose most of their value if everyone was recieving tons of free packs 

  For these reasons Artifact cannot really be compared to other contemporaries , while it bears some similiarities to the HS or MTG formula it is a staunchly different game at its essence and must be regarded independently by all accounts .  Predictions that may take over 200 $ to build a collection are grossly inflated [ imo ] because just as with any other card game , there are certain cards you probably won't ever feel like using and / or don't need 3 copies of .


  As far as actual gameplay Artifact delivers exactly what it promised , which is a slightly fresh take on the CCG formula with slightly deeper mechanics than other similar games , without being overly complex .  All of the flavor text for every card is fully voice acted which is great , and there are enough of a diverse approach to victory conditions to make it unpredictable , 

  But you defintiely can't compare a young game like this to something like Hearthstone that has been around for years and has a gigantic card roster , it is meant to be a much more intimate exploration of the Dota 2 universe and an exercise in strategic thinking rather than a game where you can buy all the most powerful cards and spam them to gain rank [ there is not a visible power curve that facilitates any kind of pay-to-win aspect , so i will have to say all of the reviews that say otherwise seem to be totally unfounded ] 

  Art Style :     9 / 10 
  Music :          9 / 10 
  Gameplay :    9 / 10 
  Accessibility : 9 / 10
  Replay Value : 9 / 10 

  Verdict :  9 / 10  Game is brand new so over time the monotization aspect may become more burdensome to new players , but still significantly less steep than other CCGs particularly because there are not any ' Legendary ' cards which are visibly more powerful than others , anyone can pretty much join right in and be competetive especially with various draft modes and premade decks etc.
its pretty good so far you know, best looking online card game i have seen and more features than any of the others had at launch or still have-even that big one...you know the one I am talking about
Have played card games my entire life. From Magic the Gathering to Hearthstone. 

So I would compare this to HearthStone, since they are both orignally digital card games. 

I think the main complaint that I see is that Artifact is expensive, but to be honest, I believe Hearthstone cost way more for you to be competitive. Sure you can play the game for free and grind out for free packs, but if you really want to have the top tier decks you will need to put in a good amount of money to get the cards. Especially with the standard rotations and new sets coming out every qtr. The only reason I am saying this  is because everyone is making a big deal about Artifact being a money grab, but in my opinion Hearstone is clearly the more expensive game. I still enjoy playing Hearthstone, and I have continue to buy packs and expand my collection, but to me Artifact is an  amazing card game and I believe the depth of strategy and complexity of it far exceeds Hearthstone. In my opinion, I believe that is what we should compare when it comes to the games. 

I enjoy playing every game of Artifact so far. The digital marketplace makes it easier for me to acquire the cards that I want for my deck, and the prices are not too outragous. 

The game modes so far are very enjoyable, although I have limited time, I have tried the keeper drafts and casual play. I am really excited to see where the games goes and hope that the community gives the game a chance to grow. 

I belive the potential is there for this game to be on the competitive seen. 


I was originally unsure of how much I would like Artifact when I saw the game being played. I had hundreds of hours into Hearthstone but eventually stopped playing it due to the constant state of new cards coming out and the fact that I only really played it for Arena near the end. So when I saw this had free to play Casual Draft mode I was immediately hooked. I've been playing the game non-stop while at home, and even at work while it's slow. It requires constant thinking and I absolutely love it. If you like puzzle solving, deck building trategy, or even worker placement type games then you'll enjoy Artifact.
This has the best monitization model of any TCG on the internet. You can dirrectly buy the EXACT cards you want, completely avoiding all of the RNG. Stop crying.
A very fun well put together cardgame! It has depth, and there is a lot to learn. The more I played the more enjoyable I found it - initially there is just so much to learn...But once I've got to the point where I feel like I can outplay people (or be cleaverly outplayed) I have really been enjoying it.

Be aware of the way the game works pricing wise - there is pleanty of ways to play for free; but owning more virtual cards will cost you money one way or another. On the other hand any virtual cards you have will keep a virtual value. 

Overal I think it is a deep game with options for everyone; if you dont plan on spending any more monay in the game both the events (currently call to arms) and the free draft allow you to play against people on a level playing field - with no Pay to Win involved. If you want to own all the virtual cards know that it will cost money in buying them off the marketplace or buying packs. 

I enjoy the game, I hope you are intrested in checking it out too.

Thanks Steam. Thanks Richard Garfield :-)
Great Game! The moentization is way better then any other card game, I made my money back from buying the game with 7 cards. Overall a fun game to play whether in casual mode or in expert mode.
A lot of complaints I've heard have to do with the "pay to play" model, but the only criticism I find reasonable in that realm of thought is the $20 cost of the game. I got a beta key (yeet) so I didn't have to pay that entry, but I definitely wouldn't have minded paying that cost after getting a chance to try it out.

The way to see it is that buying the game gets you infinite free draft mode and you can spend more money if you want to play constructed. That 20 packs and 5 tickets doesn't really make a competative deck, but you don't need cards to play draft- you just draft some cards and play.

If you hear anyone saying about having to pay to play "competitively" (even in draft), this refers to the "expert" modes; the only difference between that and the free "casual" mode is that you get packs if you do well. There are also free tournaments and friend challanges you can do. Also, most pros consider it to be the best mode in Artifact, so don't feel like you'd playing the "lesser experience" if you only buy the game for draft.

That being said, constructed shouldn't be too expensive either. After the game's been out a bit farther from release, getting a full collection of cards should only cost somewhere between $250 and $350, but you don't need all the cards to be competitive. Barely any cards in the game are even a dollar; all but about 6 the commons are 5 cents. Yes, Axe costs ~$15 and Drow costs ~$11, but you by no means have to play either of them in a good deck. Another consideration is that if you only have one deck and get bored with it, you don't need to shovel out a whole wad of cash to play something more interesting. You can sell all of the valuable cards you don't plan on using again for 80% of their value and then buy the new pieces you need.

Eveyone already knows how deep and intriguing Artifact is; if this seems like THE game for you, don't be afraid to drop $20. If you're a filthy casual (kappa) and you're unsure if the gameplay is your thing, don't be afraid to pass and stick to all the great ftp games on the market.
This is one of the best card games, digital or physical, that i have ever played. I have not had this much pure fun learning and playing a game since I first cracked open a pack of Magic cards 20 years ago. However it is obviously not a game for most people- it is just too complicated to have mass appeal. I am sure Valve and RG know that this game is not going to compete with Hearthstone in terms of sheer numbers. And that is fine- do we really need another Hearthstone? Ask Elder Scrolls Legends, among others,  how well aping Hearthstone has worked out for them. If anything I would compare the gameplay to a smaller digital card game RG worked on called SolForge.

Interesting enough this game has an economic system that is nearly identical to tabletop Magic and MTGO. The only significant difference is that it is possible to get physical copies of your cards in MTGO. Overall it is a good value for a TCG - $20 for two starters, 10 boosters and 5 event tickets is not bad in the world of Magic- it is par for the course- not a choice that is going to bring in a huge audience, but one Magic players are familiar with. And if you like to net deck, you can build almost any deck you can find out there for a handful of dollars. I am ok with that. Artifact also throws in about a dozen decks you can use for the Call to Arms launch event. You can only use those decks for the event- and everyone has the same decks. Seems fair to me. 

TLDR: If you like and play card games or board games or Dota buy the game- it is a beautiful (in terms of both appearance and design), deep, uncompromising creation. If the ONLY card games you have played are Hearthstone or its many imitators this may not be the game for you.
Great game.  An innovative yet affordable take on TCG's.  There are ways to get free packs with the new update, but for me even without the update I'm just glad this game is fighting against the free to play grind fest of the current TCG model.  Hearthstone always felt like a chore and to buy cards always felt like russian roulette.  You get way more value out of your duplicate cards in Artifact and can sell them on the market place and it's 2 bucks for a pack which is guarenteed to have at atleast 1 Rare and 1 uncommon and there is a chance to get more in a pack (Note:  Only 3 rarities which is also good ).  You can just straight up buy the cards too and since the packs are so affordable it keeps the marketplace very reasonable since if it gets too expensive you can just buy packs and get great value out of it.  The gameplay is terrific.  You have 3 lanes to play and your heroes add a whole new dynamic level to the experience.  Unlike Planeswalkers in Magic you start with one hero in each lane and deploy 1 more the next two rounds and if they die they come back in a couple rounds so you can count of them having a consistent presence in the game.  They also determine what card colors you can play in a lane so deploying your heroes is as important as how you use your cards.  Even with it only have one set of cards is fun and interesting to play.  Highly recommend it to any TCG fans out there.
a well made and very deep game with a high skill cieling and a relatively large learning curve. some of the game design i don't completely understand (ogre magi has a 50% chance to return a blue spell to your hand; which also gives a 50% chance that your tower will eat 18 damage due to lightning bolts) but i guess that's part of any card game. the air is smelling like pay to win, but i'll have to play more to see on that one. maybe when you hand RN-Jesus the wheel it takes the pay to win out of the equation? alright, i gotta go, i'll see ya'll later.
As a long time fan of both Hearthstone and Dota 2, I just had to check try the new Dota 2 card game when it came out.

I have to say, it has been very enjoyable to me at least. The game itself is very well made: the game design, art, and polish all blow a game like Hearthstone out of the water. Of course, it comes at a cost of a steeper learning curve, but the reward is worth it if you are willing to put the time in. 

As for the market, it's different, and again, does not appeal to the casual player. However, to compare it to games like Hearthstone and MTGA is foolish, each economy has their own benefits. Valve does not make more money with this economy than it would if it followed Hearthstone's footsteps. I'm not going to get into the reasons why, but there are plenty of arguments and evidence from passed digital TCGs that demonstrate this point. So no, Valve is not any more "greedy" than Blizzard with their pricing model, and no, Artifact does not cost more money than Hearthstone to enjoy.

PROS:
-deep
-competitive
-beautiful

CONS:
-steep learning curve
-long-ish games
-complexe
-barrier to entry, money wise (which really does not say anything about the game itself)
Played a couple of bot matches and one full round of casual draft. I haven't played the payed modes yet, so my review will be limited to these aspects.

I really like that the game provides an additional dimension in form of three lanes to work with. This reminded me of Faeria where you had a board game in addition to a TCG. I really like this concept.

The draft mode was refreshingly NOT Pay-to-Win in contrast to the default game modes in F2P TCGs where as a starter you are confronted with opponents having well build decks that just crush you while you have barely something beyond the starter decks. Those often also feature draft modes, however, they have costs that prohibit playing them mainly. However, even though I didn't play it I expect the constructed game mode in Artifact to be Pay-To-Win for the same reasons mentioned before. This seems to be one of the reasons for the review bombing that people who like to play constructed won't be able to compete without paying up more. At F2P TCGs  you at least have a chance to catch up by grinding excessively.

Unfortunately, without paying more the game does not seem to feature any kind of progress display as of yet. Playing mostly RPGs I am very disappointed of the lack of EXP bars or any number that goes higher the more I play (although it displays your number of perfect runs through the modes, but that's not enough for me).
objective critics here        

----> Overall/resume: This feels new/fresh (dont listen to the salty ones) recomend but $ might end up as a problem.


----->detailed ''review''

pros:  

-you can fell the mtg vibe(no land tho): the colors, there is some phase (different then mtg ones tho), the diversity of abilities for the ''creature'' cards(considering it a new game)

 -3 lane: make it different (in a good way) then any card game i tried , it add a layer of strategy
 
- the ''shop deck/phase'' : Again it unique to it genre it add a layer of strategy

- Artwork on card are nice and each card (i think) have a ''lore'' the card ''has something to say'' it cool

- *for me it not a pros but for some it can be i guess*: you can sell your cards in game

-you have 5 hero card in your deck and the game is ''based'' around them  iIfind it interessting


Cons:

- *for me it not a cons but for some it can be i guess* it complex compared many other card games

-you have to spend money if you wants cards; you cant win them by playing. That a big cons for me, but I still enjoy the game. The price seems to be resonable but if one day there some ''game changer''cards that go around for more then 8-10 bucks(like if you dont own one you will be more likely to lose)  il uninstal
Ignore the "need to pay" reviews, it's straight up bullshit.
You can play the game for free.

If you decide to spend some money on it, the monetization model is far more consumer-friendly than any other card game.

Gameplay is great. I'm absolutely thrilled by the fact that the outcome of a game is not decided by RNG in the first 2 turns (looking at you HS).
this game is superrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr fun
and on microtransaction part is good

I mean this game is really fair if you think about it  if you by game and sell all card you have you kidda buy game for free and i just put 2 buck i get the deck i want (mono bule) yeah some deck are expensive  but you have the choice
This game has ALOT of rng during a match. Heroes and mobs are placed in random positions in the lanes, and what they choose to attack is also determined randomly during placement. To cast cards you need to have a hero in the lane of that color, but if your opponent randomly got to go first that round, given the right circumstances he can kill your hero before you even have your first turn, and so now you can't play any of your cards. The game on top of that nonsense also has rng card effects like those seen in hearthstone.

Blah Blah Blah Yada Yada Yada, a better player will average more wins, but that will be frontloaded mostly in the deck building aspect as with any rng game. There is just far too much going on in this game that is completely out of your control while affecting you greatly. 

Comebacks do happen and it feels great when a choice you made eeked out a win, but due to all the factors not in your control, during some matches you might feel like a chimpanzee hitting a big red button to pass your turn instead of making meaningful choices.

This game is easily more complex than Hearthstone, which to my kind of people means it is already better, but I am still dissappointed in the sheer quantity of rng mechanics woven into the fabric. 

I want MORE of a gap created between a good player and a bad player in my competitive games, not less.

On the extreme positive side, the monetization is fantastic if you enjoy the idea of having a market back up your card game. In Artifact each of your cards has value and you can sell them freely, while being able to DIRECTLY purchase cards you want in order to build a deck (this makes it the CHEAPEST card game, f2p or not, if you're looking for competitive constructed play). On my end alone, I made back far more than the price of the game just by selling the cards I got from my 10 boosters that were included. 

With all the cards not worth selling after I did a few cycles of [sell cards][buy boosters][repeat], I recycled them 20 at a time to get a total of 15 event tickets (1 ticket is valued at $1). 1 event ticket is the entry cost to a phantom draft (my mode of choice), where you play to 5 wins or 2 losses, and 3 wins will net you back 1 event ticket, with 4 and 5 wins netting you 1 and 2 card packs (1 card pack is valued at $2).

So, with the $20 purchase price, totaling raw wallet value and event tickets, I made back $45, and am now pretty much set to go a few thousand hours without dropping another dime if I intend to only do competitive draft.
Cool game. But Valve: Dont be flashing game titles under your valve logo in the trailer like you got a lot of games under your belt unti you actually make more games... lol. Nice logo animation though - its just not accurate.
This is a bit early, but I've been having too much fun to not give it a thumbs up. 

As someone who played a good amount of hearthstone, I would say that this is more hardcore and a higher potential fun ceiling, but losing feels a lot worse, and its hard to play a quick game as easily. Boring centrist answer I know. 

If you like card games like hearthstone, yu-gi-oh etc. I would say buy, if you aren't already a fan of card games like this then probably wait on buying
This game is really fun. I'm a bit stuck on cards, but those cards really feel like something if you have them. Don't forget you can get a Tier 1 deck for like 30€ at the marketplace. You can not do that with something like hearthstone. I hope this game will go all the way, its so much fresh air. And if you missed it, WePlay on twitch is hosting an amazing tournament.
Great game with unbelievable detail. Yes, it cost money, but it emulates the feeling of playing with real cards. Of course, the person who spends a lot of money will often have a slight advantage, but that does not define this game. If you like card games or enjoy Dota 2 I imagine you will love this game. I have already played dozens of hours vs Bots, random players, and friends. Versus all three I have experienced outstanding/memorable moments that I have gotten from very few other games.
This is a fun and intense card game. Its action packed and feels like every play has meaning. The way the economy is handled makes sense to me. Only a select few cards are worth more than a couple dollars, and theres lots of fun to be had without dropping a bunch of dough. The $20 purchase price gets you $20 worth of packs, plus 5 event tickets, plus 2 starter decks, plus access to all the free and fun game modes. 

This systems means no bots, no scams, no problems, only the tears of entitled gamers.
This game is INSANE, both combine strategy and fun, especially if you play dota 2.
But, you can't pretend to people to spend money over money to get the game, get the packs and play "competitive" with the tickets. You have to offer the opportunity to get something free at least weekly, or people won't move from Hearthstone to this game.
Peace
good game, microtransaction system actually well made and not that necessary, you'll get money from selling your extra cards then you'll buy some, feels like a TRADING card game...
The game is nice and fun, really addicting.

The only problem is after you opened your free pack and used all of your ticket there is no more ways to get packs without spending more money.

if they add any kind of free rewards and a rank system ( like hearthstone )  it going to be a pretty good game.
I don't write many "serious" reviews, or reviews at all, but I am writting this one because of the unsurprising amount of negative feedback received due to the missunderstanding of the currency model.

PROS:
+ You can play casual draft for free. This allows you to build a deck with any cards available in the game. So no, you don't need to whip out the credit card unless you want to play constructed competitively. 
+ No grinding required. There's no need to use luck, or lack thereof. If you really want the best hero cards for competitive play you can buy them outright on the market. 
+ Amazing music, visuals, and voice lines. Great lore!
+ Allows for your own social tournaments and challenging your friends. 
+ In-game spectator mode and replays. Puts other TCGs to shame.
+ Varying bot difficulty, and can play with any card/deck you want them to have.
+ You can try out pre-made decks from the Call to Arms cards.
+ Great minds working on the game. Good updates so far and they listen to feedback where necessary. After watching the tournament, a lot of twitch streams and playing for a few hours I can say that this is the best TCG I've played in a long while, the gameplay is very refreshing.
 
CONS:
- Highly addicting. The game is complex and a lot of fun, make sure to stay hydrated and take breaks.
- Very little marketing, and lack of PR. This goes for any Valve game.
- The only way to obtain free packs is behind a ticket paywall or buying card packs. I suggest a weekly free ticket or pack for playing a draft, or competing in casual tournaments so it can't be grinded. This rewards players for coming back to the game at least once a week.
As someone who has spent a regrettable amount of money on Hearthstone, the total cost of ownership for Artifact is significantly lower. Sure, you can't grind cards, but it still manages to be more fair than Hearthstone's dust system.
Very well thought out. As a Dota fan, this is a great addition to the franchise in my opinion. The lore, aesthetic, card interaction, its like you're the overseer of an actual Dota match and its awesome. You get plenty for the $20 price tag. 10 packs with 10 cards in each and 5 tickets which you can use to get more packs and more tickets. Phantom Draft is another way to get cards as well. Plus you would've more than likely spent over $20 getting packs anyway if it was F2P. Fantastic game
If you've ever played Hearthstone and thought, "I wish I could just buy the card I want instead of grinding pointless quests, wasting money on expansions, and throwing gold into the arena," consider Artifact.

I'm just a guy who likes card games, and without even being competitive in Hearthstone I've probably spent over $100 due to expansion pre-orders, and it feels like I never have good cards for decks. Artifact gave me the option to have an initial buy-in that was lower than any other games' expansion packs I've seen. 

Aside from the price, I don't know why this was marketed to DotA 2 players. Yeah, the lore is there but it's really completely different. The lanes are a great concept in a card game, hero synergies are really interesting, and you can win or lose depending on how you manage a lane, not RNG (for the most part).

It's fun, it's hard, and between the free game modes, the decks, packs, and event tickets you get for the base price, and the overall gameplay, it's well worth the $20.
[h1]TL;DR tell me about the economy![/h1]
This is the hottest topic right now, so I figured I'd put a FAQ about Artifact pricing at the top here. For all the answers, I've tried to be as complete as I can. Hope this helps.

[b]Can I play it for free?[/b]
No

[b]Can I play it for only the entrance price?[/b]
Yes, but you don't get card rewards like in MtG:A or Hearthstone

[b]Where's the ladder with rewards?[/b]
Artifact offers "Gauntlets" which cost USD1 to enter (half as much as Hearthstone's Arena mode as played from US/EU), are slightly shorter, and pay out a little bit more.

[b]Can I grind this ladder for rewards forever like in Hearthstone and MTG:A?[/b]
If you're good at Artifact, sure. You will always be able go infinite with a 57% winrate by shredding your pack rewards (assuming you sell the guaranteed rare for USD0.50 on average). If you open any cards above .05 cents in value, you can sell them to put towards more gauntlet entries or so you can keep some sweet rares for constructed. If you do even better than 57%, the rewards just keep increasing too. Artifact is very rewarding to be the best at (literally!), and many professional players have mentioned during the beta that they win more often against worse players in Artifact than in any other games.

[b]How much does it cost to play constructed?[/b]
Community members are reporting that just after launch they're able to purchase full collections for (significantly) less than USD300. This will probably continue to decrease over time as more gauntlets are played. A complete meta deck's worth of cards is already less than USD50, and will probably continue to decrease in price over time. 

[b]But there's MMR, so I can only win 50% of the time![/b]
Valve has mentioned that MMR is only used in Gauntlet to match from the pool of people with the same win-loss record as you. If you're 0-1 you'll be matched with someone else who's 0-1. In addition, MMR only reduces the impact of the best player on the weakest player: If you're better than other people playing, you'll still be above 50% winrate, you're just not going to be matched against the worst Artifact player. 

[b]I don't think I'm better than the average Artifact player, but I still want rewards![/b]
I think Artifact could do a lot better here. There aren't any consolation prizes for draft at all, and if you lose more than you win (which is normal for a new player without prior card game experience), the gauntlet modes are horrible value, and you might as well just buy packs. The good news is that there are free-play constructed and draft gauntlets that you don't have to pay for, but I still would prefer to see Valve provide some sort of minimum prize for your time playing the paid gauntlet modes. After all, you can't have a player above 50% winrate without having a player below 50%.

[b]How expensive is it to have below 50% winrate?[/b]
Assuming you're shredding all of your cards but the rare (All rares are above USD0.15 right now, so you should expect to be able to sell at least one card per pack. To match the winning calculation above, I'll use USD0.50 as the rare card's sell value), you'll have to buy a ticket for each two gauntlet runs you play. This does get better for each card in your pack that costs more than USD0.05, but it still feels stingy on the losing side.

[b]Is there regional pricing?[/b]
No. Players living in countries where USD1 is significantly more buying power are at a pretty big disadvantage here. The game feels very much balanced around an audience from the USA, and there isn't regional pricing or any other kind of price balancing to make the game less expensive in less affluent countries. Due to the way Valve have designed their market, it doesn't seem like this is likely to change in the future either. I would have preferred to see perhaps some way of earning region-locked cards for lower entrance fees than no solution at all.

[h1]The game is really good[/h1]

+ This game has a TON of interactivity. Not only do I feel like I could have played my way out of every situation my opponent put me in, but my opponent's plays could also completely change my plans if I wasn't ready for them.
+ Artifact's three lanes and two card draws per round make cards in hand super valuable. The choice of whether you even should play cards in a lane is meaningful, and you have to ask that question every round.
+ Forward planning is extremely rewarding in this game. Setting things up a lane or even a whole round in advance without letting your opponent know what you're doing is one of the hardest and most fun things you can do in this game.

- The UI can let the game down sometimes. Sometimes it's that the camera isn't moving when you want it to, other times it's that the camera is moving when you want it to stay put. When you're looking at other lanes, you can't see your turn counter so you aren't reminded that it's your turn and the clock has been ticking down this whole time. It's not a huge annoyance, but every few games there will be something that's mildly annoying.
- Sometimes trying to find a good play is just too hard. It takes time to learn all the cards and possibilities, and you can get stuck feeling like every card in your hand is a bad card to play without knowing how you ended up here.
- The previous actions tracker only goes back one play. Technically this is adequate because your opponent can only make one play before you can check it, but a full history would really be better.
- As discussed in the FAQ above, Artifact is pretty stingy in the paid gauntlets when you're on the losing side. Maybe this is to create more motivation to play harder, but a consolation prize of similar value to what competitors like MTG:A or Hearthstone offer (guaranteed pack for each, though HS's entry ticket could have bought you two packs if you paid cash) would be extremely appreciated.
Great game with an actual decent monetization model for a TGC; even more considering what you get for the $20.
Game is easy to get into, well explained even though it has some hard concepts. Had quite some fun playing so far.


Feels very polished as expected from Valve, runs smooth and has a good interface (both in-game and menu/deck).
The only things that feels like missing is a more 'permanent' ranking (MMR-like) system.
Interesting game.  More complex than Hearthstone, and takes advantage of being all-digital.  Monetization method may appear poor, but when compared to physical card games, it is actually cheaper.  It could use some sort of single-player story missions of some sort, but that may come with time.  For now, drafting is fun, the game mechanics are challenging.  No 'single way to play' for a guarantee win.
This is a fantastic trading card game which brings a lot of unique mechanics to the table, which keeps it fresh. A lot of recent trading card games recently have been free to play, which is great for them and if it works for them then that's even better! However, this is not free to play, more akin to a real trading card game... which doesn't hurt it at all. It's more competitive and not as casual due to this, I think. That isn't to say that casual players cannot play Artifact, though. Free players can always play in phantom drafts which have been widely praised as being really great and fun to play in. 
This game does not deserve the negative reviews it gets for being more payment based than the other trading card games out there, the model works okay here and the prices aren't extravagant for cards as some reviewers may lead you to believe. 
Anyways, here's a positive review to help the game's rating because Artifact deserves it.
All these people complaining about the monetization of the game don't realize the game takes skill, and those that cant make a winning deck resort to complaining. I guess just wait until someone posts cheap easy decks for you to copy since you cant think of your own.

I built a deck for about $10 cdn and ripped through whales. If you feel you need to spend 200 to win how about you get good first to realize you dont even need more than 10 bucks. 





Artifact is the most fun I've ever had in card game. Ever. The constant back and forth of actions keeps gameplay very engaging, and the 3 lane board adds another dimension of potential options and strategy. There is immense depth in the cards' mechanics and the ways in which they interact, yet it still remains very approachable to and easy to pick up as a newcommer. I think my average game length is around 15 minutes, and in general feels very satisfying.

While it's true that there is no way to earn packs for free, the casual draft and precronstructed gauntlets are free and put everyone on an equal footing. These game modes do not let you use the cards in your collection, so buying cards/packs does not affect them.
Artifact is a CCG at its finest, for the good and the bad. Designed by Richard Garfield he has created another game very much in the style of his most well known creation, Magic the Gathering. Here though, you have a game where you run three seperate lanes needing to meet two win conditions for a victory, while your opponent looks to stop your march to victory while attempting a victory of their own.

Artifact is about the card game, in its current incarnation it is very bare boned, giving you the option of building your deck and then four options for the card game. The first option is the current special mode. This gives options of pre-built decks to challenge other players using those same decks against each other tallying up your wins. The second option is bot matches, where you can play against bots using your preconstructed deck, as well as decks from featured modes. 

The third mode is casual play. It consists of matchmaking with your preconstructed deck against players of your skill level, as well as other modes that might cycle out. These might include modes like phantom draft, where you draft a deck from five packs where you draft along with other players, picking two cards from your pack and then two from each players' packs. 

The fourth option is expert play, which adds danger to your game, as you use a ticket to play, winning tickets and card packs back with enough wins or losing everything if you don't. Tickets cost $0.99 each and you start the game with five. There is a reason this mode is called expert. Do not enter it unprepared.

The final option is Collection. You open your ten free card packs and build your deck here. And this is where you will hear the most complaints from people about this game. While there are other options to play that do not require a constructed deck, if you want to build a strong deck you will most likely need to pay money for more card packs. At $1.99 for a 12 card pack the price is very reasonable with physical card games' booster packs. This being a digital game where similar games in the market have more and easier options to collect free card packs people will be upset at the game not being set up as Hearthstone. Additionally, individual cards can be purchased on the marketplace for variable rates, which players can artificially drive up the prices of making rare cards even harder to collect. 

Overall, Artifact is a classic CCG, paywall and all. But there is enough in the game that doesn't require additional payments for cards that the game remains fun and variable through each game if one is willing to look beyond constructed decks. Artifact is the next step of a creator known for his innovation, with a fun twist on an old concept.
This game has solid design and depth in mechanic. I would recommend it for its future.
    Now, it does have many problems but most people are focusing on wrong points.
    It's biggest problem is current card pool is so limited that there's no enough diversity.
    Drow/Treant/Omni and most Red heroes overshadowed blue/black. R/RB aggro or GU ramp are only winner in current meta. Improvoments and buffs lack a solide counter option.

    Just ignore "Oh I can't stand this monetization!" Bullsht by impotent cynics only played 1hr

    Artifact is a "Trading Card Game", not "Collecting Card Game".

   after reading this, I think you would realize many negative reviews are not acurrate,
like vegans criticizing steak but not providing facts but only "I think".
    Now please allow me to explain why many negative reviews are not accurate and helpfull.

    [Card price is reasonable]

    Have you ever played a physical MTG draft game in your local game store?
    In TCG standard, Playing Articact is actually much more affordable than MTG

    I spent 300$ on opening packs and now I have →full collection← in Artifact.
    A solid MTG deck (Jeskai Control/ 16.81% meta ) would cost 454 usd (price from Goldfish)
    A 8000 arcane dust worth deck in Hearthstone would cost:
         1 pack's expectation is 100 arcane dust worth (100gold = 100 dust   lazy BLZ)
         1.5 usd for one pack (59.99 = 40 packs)
         8000 dust = 80 packs = 120 usd for single deck
    Even you don't want to pay, you can play free draft in Artifact. You always pay to play draft in Hearthstone/mtga/shadowverse, etc.

    Right now high price of some cards (like axe) are due to shortage it will soon drop after 2 weeks.


    [Trade tax ≠ greedy monetization]

    Yes, there is a trade 15% tax. But when you playing physical card games, you need to waste time on working with paypal, ebay, and postoffice. How much would you pay to sell a 2$ card to someone living in another state?
    Your government also tax you, are you going to pretest? No because your government provides you service.
    Valve also provides you service to build a platform. You pay 15% tax to one click sell your cards(witch is your property, you cant do this in the majority of current digital card games)

     And let's do some comparason.
    Sell cards on ebay:
         - sale tax in your state + cost to mail it + time cost
    recycle your cards in online CCG game like Hearthstone: 
         - you get 25% arcane dust (a whooping 75% sale tax!)

    [No reward for grinding]

    In those CCG games, free players grind and are more likely to be defeated by paid players. In another word, free players are "Game content" for paid players.
    And once the cards rotate out of current format, free players need to grind again.
    If you are not lucky enough to get your cards from opening packs, you suffer a panelty to make that card you miss (card-dust-card lost in hearthstone. limit of wildcards in mtga)
    you also lose a significant value of your duplicated cards in CCG.
    
Every card games work in this way. Game is not charity. If you don't like how it works, that only means trading card games is not your cup of tea.
But if you find yourself enjoying it, Congrats. Artifact could be your gateway to a huge table game and you could find more interesting table games in your local game store.
Ignore the negative reviews complaining about monetization. The only modes that require money are the prize-winning tournaments. Everything else is free and easy to play with friends, and this is an absolutely amazing game.
The game itself is very fun and engaging. I enjoy the back and forth pacing this game has as opposed to the turn based systems other tcgs have. This game has flaws, but it is a good pickup if you are a tcg veteran or if you have watched a lot of artifact content already.

--monitization--

As far as price is concerned, I prefer this game's market model to other tcgs 'grind until you give up and spend money' model. I like that there is no reward for playing this game like a second job, just pay for what you need and enjoy the game.

All of that said, a full set of an expansion will cost around $150-$200, which is in line with other digital tcgs, and blows paper magic out of the water.  So it is nice that there is a non rng alternative that lets you skip the junk and get the cards you want if you dont have more than an extra 30 dollars to drop. 

If you are buying this game, make sure to do some research so you know which cards you want to get. Give the casual draft a go to see how the game plays and to try cards you dont have.

--gameplay--

Like I said above, I really like the back and forth system of gameplay. Another thing I like is the opportunities for counterplay and comebacks this game offers. Having your board wiped is actually not as bad as it would be in other games like hearthstone or magic. Some games are absolute rollercoasters until they end, and I love how stressful it can get.

The lack of hand and board limits is a nice touch as well.

I have mixed feelings about the level of rng elements in the game. Some cards, like cheating death and fog of war, are pretty garbage card design imo. That being said, this game lets you respond to rng in a lot of ways, which gives the feeling of control despite heavy rng. I am sure the rng will annoy me much more later, but right now it is not messing with my experience.

There is also something to be said about the way they say they will go about balancing, which is a very hands off approach. I hope if they ever do nerf/ban cards, people are properly compensated. When problem cards do appear, their response will probably be slow and careful. Take that as you will.

The inclusion of a flexible tournament mode is a huge plus for me, but I have not done much with it so I will update this review when I have tried it. I know that through this mode, you can play 'pauper' formats like commons only. 

Playing this game with a friend is really fun due to the lack of downtime and occasional rng memes.

--conclusion--

Right now, I feel good about the game. I recommend it to anyone who is willing to watch the game a bit before they jump in. I will update this review in month if my feelings have changed, as it takes time to understand a tcg.
I loved! It is an easy to learn but hard to master card game. A truly digital mtg experience.

If you value your time and/or wants fair prices, get Artifact.
Great game. Yes you have to pay up front but draft is free, lots of free pre-constructed options and most cards are already worth barely anything so actual constructed isn't even that expensive.

Game is very complex, definitely a lot of fun. Would recommend.
This is how you do a card game.

People that are complaining about the monetization have a case I will admit: The strongest two cards of each color aren't as cheap as the rest of the set combined, but I feel you can still have fun in constructed even without that.

That being said, most of my time has come from drafting. Artifact's drafting is honestly perfect. I mean, it can screw you at times by giving you the same three terrible heroes that nobody wants over and over again, but isn't that kind of the point of draft? 

Anyway, people complaining about having to pay for competitive modes is pretty silly. Casual is not any different from competitive besides the tickets/rewards system. You're not missing out on anything besides the thrill of earning packs on a good draft run or trying to earn your ticket back after a bad early draft loss. It's a risk/reward system which is surprisingly generous, at least in Phantom Draft, the mode I play.

And if you aren't into that kind of risk/reward system, just go play casual draft. It's no different.

EDIT:

Nevermind they fixed every problem lmao
gameplay is fantastic but i guess the most pressing issue is the monetisation:

- its buy to play, so you dont really expect extra 'fees' (but to get a decent collection expect about double (that is; to get all the cards i wanted -not for one specific deck, just the ones that seemed interesting to me- i dished out another ~£20 on the marketplace) what the base game cost, and for a full collection maybe triple or quadruple)

- packs cost real money, the game gives you 10 to begin with (about the upfront cost) and you cant really earn more without spending more money (well there is; but on that next)

- the game gives you 5 'event tickets', these are used to enter some events; like drafting... theoretically you can go infinite in these events, getting slightly more wins than losses equals a ticket and going more gives you packs; so theres that but its unreliable

- cards are marketable (on the steam market)... and honestly most are pennies; theres a couple relatively expensive ones (axe being the main one, though drow and kanna are pretty high too) which creates a weird situation where it doesnt seem worth it to buy packs indvidually (you could get lucky with multiple axe drops and recoup the cost, but chances are itll be a loss compared to just buying what you dropped on the market)

- you can 'recycle' 10 cards into an event ticket (previously mentioned); obviously intended to get rid of bulk 'trash' (few are actually trash) cards and maintain a healthy price... but seems to be failing as most cards are less than £0.10, and very very few are over £1 (though last i checked the three major outliers; axe, drow and kanna were sitting at around £12, £7 and £5 respectively... currently these are very low compared to the high end of other paper TCGs; but ofcourse the future is sketchy and prices can easily fluctuate)

- unlike other online ccgs (well, artifact is tcg, but obviously the comparisons are going to be to hearthstone, mtg:arena etc due to its online nature); theres no daily quests or the ilk... like a paper card game, unless you spend money, your collection wont grow

- also a personal grievance; no integration with DotA+ (dotas optional subscription)... like buying artifact even gives you 1 month of dota+ and im surprised/appalled (maybe a strong word) that there isnt like daily/weekly quests for shards (dota+ currency) and shard integration in artifact (buying cosmetic card backs or those little imp things)... i think theres a massive missed opportunity to have the sub as a cross game feature


*EDIT* on the fluctuation of prices, axe is now £22+, drow £13 and kanna £9

*EDIT2* £16, £12 and £8 currently
Artifact is recieving a lot of negative attention for it's card acquisition model. I like it's model more than other card games I've played, but don't think it is perfect by any means. Game play is pretty solid and I would recommend it overall.
An excellent game with good strategic depth. It's not too expensive to get a good deck either.

Draft is free too, so you get to try every card in the game in the most balanced mode.
You can draft for free and buy a whole collection for less than it would cost to get the cards for 1 hearthstone/magic expansion. It's not expensive like everyone says, the problem is that you have to buy the game to be able to play it, which people aren't happy with. If you like draft you can play this forever once you've bought it, if you like constructed you can build the decks pretty cheap.
WORTH THE MONEY IGNORE THESE COMMIES IN THE REVIEW SECTION.
You could buy a full play set (3 of every card 1 of every hero) for around $160 including the $20 purchase point and inflated Axe and Drow cards. Go spend $160 on Hearthstone or MTG and see where that gets you, you MIGHT be able to build 1 or 2 "meta" decks if you focus, but you won't have every single card in a set and you'll be far away from having all the cards you need to build any deck you want. I doubt there are any pro Hearthstone players who have spent less than $1k on cards. This game has competitive play in mind from the start, AND THERE IS NO GAME CHEAPER TO GET TO A COMPETITIVE LEVEL THAN ARTIFACT. 

As for casuals, for $20 you get the best produced card game out there by a landslide. The art on the cards is great and every single one of those suumbiches has a voice actor reading lore. The animations and sound in game are awesome, and voice actors react to situations and heroes interact with voice lines. Producing these things cost money, sorry Bernie supporters. You also get 10 packs right away, which covers the cost. I've never played a card game which I liked and didn't eventually drop at least $20 on packs. Also if you just want to play phantom drafts forever you can, and sell back your cards. You might only get $5 back or you might make a profit if you get a drow and an axe. But this isn't a "pay to play" game. The tickets are OPTIONAL. I myself haven't used one, I just play my retarded constructed deck and casual drafts. In MTG Arena, it is worth it to play in the gauntlets because everyone is grinding for packs and will just quit after 2 turns if they don't get a good draw. Since nobody has to do that, the casual queue is much better than Hearthstone's or MTG Arena's. I would say however that having to win 3 before losing 2 just to get your ticket back is a little steep. Maybe get a random uncommon or something for your trouble but again I don't feel compelled to use my tickets so whatever.

As for the game itself, there are some RNG issues (my PA NEVER goes against a hero first turn wtf). Also constructed is kind of stale right now, hopefully that gets better with more expansions, but the phantom draft mode which again is free, is the real draw here.

My main reason for liking artifact however is the amount of in game decision making there is. In Hearthstone, %90 of the decisions are made during construction, and you just play cards when it is obviously time to play them. Magic sealed/draft is the same way, though constructed Magic does offer some opprotunities to "outplay" your opponent in ways more meaningful than just not doing the wrong thing in the wrong order. Artifact blows these games away in terms of in game decision making. Even in draft games you have to constantly make decisions and react. I can play MTG Arena games while watching Netflix, but not Artifact.

If you are an old school MTG player who has ever traded a Dual land for a Shivan Dragon, this game is for you. The cards are basically worthless so you just sell the ones you don't want to get ones you do for the deck you're building, kind of like trading in a game store back before eBay. GREAT value to this game and it is fun
Ok,so people who came here to see reviews on whether to but the game or not.I would say it depends on the mindset of you.If you are a whiny little bitch who thinks u have to spend so much money to Buy Game and to Buy heroes like Axe ,Drow and Kanna.Let me tell you that ,you can win the game without those heroes all you need is a good deck constructing skill.Buying a single card in Market is way too cheapand you can create a best decks by using market and some cards are costly but as more & more people open packs and get rares the price will also decrease don't worry about that.If you really want to play this game after watching trailer or after watching BTS Tour on Twitch go for it.By the way don't trust the reviews here.Most of them are posted by those Angry Idiots who doesn't.Seem to understand this Model.Thanks for reading.
Great game so far. I've spent 4.2h playing, and haven't had to spend anything more than the purchase price. There's a pre-built deck mode included at launch that's kept me entertained thus far.

If you want to own more cards than the game gives you up front, you have to buy them. If paying money to own digital cards bothers you on a gut level, the fact that you have to pay money to own digital cards in this game will probably be a problem for you. If paying money to own things doesn't bother you all that much, you may be able to enjoy this game.

Importantly, from what I've seen so far, most cards can be bought for just a few cents. In my case, I've decided to auction off the hundreds upon hundreds of Steam trading cards I've accidentally accumulated since they launched, as there are apparently people paying money for them ...
The most in interesting and in depth card game i've played to date. 
This game will eat your money IF you want to play CONSTRUCTED. The good news is that draft is free and its fun and if youre good enough at draft you can use your 5 event tickets to go infinite and basically play for free because you will be getting more packs than you know what to do with.
Not everyone likes arena like modes in card games but this one really stands out.
Dont be put off by people saying this is a cash grab, keep in mind that most other cards games cost even more unless you are willing to slave for gold doing mundane tasks that no one wants to do.
I want to first start by saying the pay model is much more fair than people are giving the game credit for. If you compare the model to other CCGs it's actually on par or even better than most. For people who aren't scared of spending money you can outright purchase the exact cards you want to make a specific deck (gone are the days of opening 20 packs just so you can convert them into the one card you need). The competitive modes allow good players to play completely free and still fill out their collection and you don't need a strong collection to play draft modes either. The hate is completely unjustified.

As far as the actual gameplay, it's actually a surprising amount of fun. It's different, its unique and it has the same kind of replayability as MOBA games due to each match feeling different than the last. If you are a fan of CCGs and don't mind the initial $20 investment, you will be more than satisfied with your experience. If you are really worried about the pay model then check out some other CCGs and tell me this isn't fair.

Artifact is worth your attention and even more-so if you are a fan of CCGs and/or MOBA games. A truly fresh experience, one that I suspect will draw a few wannabes in years to come.
[h1]Pros & Cons[/h1]

+ This is an excellent and very polished game. I played MTG for a few years a while back and I can confidently say that I find this more fun.
+ The music & atmosphere is absolutely fantastic.
+ The three lanes, although off-putting at first, genuinely allows for a much greater degree of depth and strategy.
+ Every card has a lore-fueled description, and voice acting to go along with it.
+ There is casual phantom draft!
+ Mousing over modifier or resulting damage number will display a popup that shows the source of all the addends and minuends, and mousing over any notable keyword in the game displays its description.
+ You can view both your and your opponent's deck lists (by pressing F2 & F3 while in a match). This allows for transparency and strategic improvisation.

- I can't currently trade with friends. The only way to get a specific card is by buying it from the marketplace.
- There is no spectate option. The only way you'd be able to watch a friend's game is through the Steam client.
- There's currently no option to play Phantom Draft against a friend.
- There's no obvious ranking system. A simple display of your MMR rating would be great.
- The monetization model. It's a pretty hot topic right now but basically you can't really grind for the cards you want. The only way to get any new cards in the game is by either winning a certain number of expert games (which you have to pay for with a ticket to play), buying a booster pack for $2 or buying the particular card you want from the marketplace. 

But as much as I dislike the monetization (I'm a poor plebian), I don't necessarily disgree with it. Gabe Newel spoke about this some time ago, I'll quote what he said and you can decide for yourself:

"If time is free, or an account is free, or cards are free, then anything that has a mathematical relationship to those things ends up becoming devalued over time, whether it's the player's time and you just make people grind for thousands of hours for minor, trivial improvements, or the asset values of the cards, or whatever. That's a consequence. So you don't want to create that flood of free stuff that destroys the economy and the value of people's time."

[h1]My Biggest Problem[/h1]

RNG. I understand why games incorporate RNG, it keeps it fresh and interesting. But the way Artifact incorporates is detrimental to player agency. Creeps are randomly distributed amongst the three lanes, and when you choose where to place a hero, they're placed semi-randomly in the lane you chose. And even when a unit is placed, the game decides, through randomness, what the combat target of that unit will be.

But the main problem I have is with the power level of randomness. Let's look at Ogre Magi, he has a passive that, upon playing a blue spell card, there's a 25% chance that the card is replicated upon use, effectively negating the discard. This isn't something small, this is a free copy of what could be a very powerful card. Either I play a card, keep my fingers crossed for a multicast and get angry when it doesn't happen, or get happy that it did, with the inverse for my opponent. That means that someone will always be at least slightly peeved off. It isn't fun RNG

Let's take the most egregious example: Cheating Death. This card is an improvement you can place on a tower. Basically when there's a Green Hero in that lane of the improvement, there's a 50% chance that when a unit would die, it lives instead. This is huge. The opponent and you are both relying on the result of a coin flip, which could drastically effect the outcome of this lane. That isn't strategy and that isn't fun. Either it won't work, and you're angry, or it works and your opponent is angry.

Again, I'm not outright against RNG. But if your goal is to make this the most skill-based CCG on the market, this needs to be changed in some way.
To the people negatively reviewing this game solely because of the market I have one simple question for you:
HAVE YOU EVER PLAYED A [b]TRADING[/b] CARD GAME IN YOUR LIFE BEFORE THIS?
This game is amazing!! Ignore negative reviews that complain about money. Yes, you have to spend a little, but it’s way cheaper than Hearthstone. 

I have every hero and 3x of every other card. It cost me $250 total. That number will go down. That’s a lot less than I used to spend in Hearthstone every expansion. 

This game has deep strategy and is just plain FUN. It’s totally worth checking out.
I have been dreaming for years about a card game, where not only deck, but also decisions made during the game matter. And here it is.

Yeah, some people are complaining about the cost, but they are really wrong. AS A TCG Artifact is cheap. As a free to play game it is expensive, since simply it is not a free to play game. But you can quite seriously consider buying it just to play free drafts, they are really fun.
3 ways to play...
Constructed: Pay2win
Draft: Cheese2win
PreConstructed: Red2win

Play if you like/good at drafting. If you are a decent drafter you can get card packs consistently and cheaply (compared to other card games). If you are a casual card game player, this game will either suck your wallet dry or won't hold your attention for long. There is a lot of RNG in this game, but the skill ceiling is high to the point that experienced players will almost always beat unexperienced players.
This is an excellent jumping off point for what, if given a chance, is a game that offers an incredible amount of strategic depth wrapped up in an extremely slick, and snappy interface that simply exudes charm. Games can last anywhere from fifteen minutes to even a little over an hour, but once you get the gears of your mind turning to the tune of Artifact, time truly flies. On my first day I completely lost track of it, and ended up playing twenty hours; the longest single session of my entire gaming life -- over twenty years.

There are layers upon layers of strategy to uncover here, and both multiple viable avenues for combating your opponent as well as sneaking up on victory conditions they might not even see coming. It is so incredibly satisfying to be holding all the right cards in your hand and be building toward a perfectly synchronized combo move that will just devastate your opponent. That is, until you see how what they've been cooking up with their dozen or so cards is going to gum up the works of your master plan.

The art design, and especially the sound design, are top notch -- but would you expect anything less from Valve? This is all around an extremely competent package that lays the groundwork for what is sure to become a very influential, popular game. The only caveat I can offer is that the game can be a lot to digest, and at first might seem nigh impenetrable. But truly, once you get past the initial barrier of inscrutability, you will find a well oiled machine that reveals itself quite readily.

Highly, highly recommended. Well worth the $20 buy in price, and the card marketplace is very reasonable. It's not a game for everyone, but if you have patience and enjoy strategy, it could be for you.
Unfortunately, there are a large number of people who expect everything to be handed out to them for free.  If you wish to play constructed in Artifact, then yes, you will need to BUY cards. Shocking, I know, imagine having to actually give developers money in order to play their game.  The market integration, however, lets you pick and choose WHICH cards you want to buy and not worry about rng lootboxing.  You can also SELL your cards if you decide you do not want them anymore.  Yes, you can only sell to your Steam wallet, so thats up to you to decide if its worth it.

Furthermore, if you decide "hey I don't want to give people MONEY for stuff", well then you can play Casual Phantom draft mode, which puts all players on an equal playing field, costs NOTHING, and is VERY skill intensive.  The "Draft" mode in a TCG is where you open a "phantom" pack (i.e. not a real pack, you wont get to keep these cards), select 2 cards from that pack and then pass the remaining cards to another player, receiving the remainder of another pack from someone else and repeating.  

In this mode, everyone is on an equal footing and requires ZERO monetary input.

At the moment, no, there is no "progression system".  There are no "quests" or "daily challenges" or anything of the sort.  There is also no "ranking" or ladder system.  Valve has stated they will add progression later on in updates, but do not expect hand outs of packs or cards.  Because of the real world monetary value tied to cards through the marketplace, giving out free cards would over time reduce the value of all cards to zero dollars.  There will NEVER be a way to get free cards without paying, unless you are always able to "go infinite" in paid events, where you pay to enter and consistently win enough games to get more prizing than what you used to enter.

All in all, this game is very new, and Valve will update with many new features over time.  


CONCLUSION:

If you wish to NOT give MONEY for STUFF, then yes, you can play Phatom Draft, a COMPETETIVE SKILL BASED mode on an even playing field, 100% for FREE.

You will NOT be able to play CONSTRUCTED for FREE.  The only way to get card packs is by PAYING MONEY or being EXTREMELY HIGH SKILLED(i.e. like 70%+ winrate in a highly competetive mode).

Currently there is no "quest" progression system or ranking, this will be added later but there WILL NOT be free card/packs/tickets because of the real monetary value.

The game will be difficult to learn, a similar learning curve to DotA 2, but I would highly recommend buying if you enjoy skill based games where there is a steep learning curve.  If you're hoping for a casual grindfest where you can grind 8+ hours a day to complete all your quests and win cards and play constructed 100% free, then either suck it up and free draft, or go back to Hearthstone.
One thing that wasnt advertised is that you can do endless of free phantom drafts, sure you wont keep the cards but other than that there is no way to get cards for free its a great game.
If you want to play a deep, fun, awesome card game, buy this. There is no need to pay any extra money after your initial purchase - you can play draft for free. Also, contrary to what people are saying, you CAN earn packs and tickets in-game - it just requires winning 3+ games in an expert run.

If you do want to buy some cards, Artifact is actually quite affordable compared to other card games.

Update: You can now earn packs for free just by playing. Great game, definitely recommend.
People complaining about the monetization model need to calm down and realize you don't need to have the best deck on day one. Play a little, enjoy the game, and slowly buy more cards to expand your deck just like a real tgc.
Such a refreshing and cool card game. The lane concept adds a new level of difficulty that has kept me intererested. Don't know why people are complaining about microtransactions, it's way cheaper than Hearthstone to play and much more complex.
Artifact is very strong TCG and offers a lot more with respect to gameplay than other online card games. They offer lots of game modes that are free to play, a social environment unlike anything else, and as someone who played MTG for a long time, very affordable when compared to othe TCGs.

This game is not free to play, but is by no means a greedy monetization scheme.
I love how everyone is rating this game negatively with comments like "cards are too expensive". The game hasn't even been out for 24 hours yet, of course they are expensive. And by "expensive" I mean there is a single card that costs $17 that you only need one of for some decks. Other than that, average card price is $0.62, which isn't too bad since the game has been out for one single day. Go drop another $100 on Hearthstone you idiots.
Long time cardplayer first impressions: Game has a solid foundation though constructed feels limited with only the core set out. 
Draft on the other hand has been a blast and I can already tell I am going to lose many hours on this game.
This game is really well designed and the implementation is really well polished.

I find the monetization better than other card games. It's comparable to a physical card game. You can buy single cards for fairly cheap. In the long run, I think it'll be cheaper (and less time consuming) to get the cards that you're missing because you don't rely on pack RNG or rely on grinding so much to (in other games) "craft" your missing card.

On the game design, the game is great fun. Every turn is intense, with different options, different strategies to think of. You come out of every game thinking there was something better that you could've done, or that maybe if you did X instead, it would've turned out better. In this aspect, it's just like Dota! E.g. should I push mid lane or defend my bottom lane, maybe only one hero can defend mid while I push top, should I save my abilities until an enemy show up, should I use a spell now to push for damage, which lane should I buff, etc.

AND the lore is a plus. The voice acting is superb. All this really adds to the polished feel of the product. 10/10.
I am not really sure why so many people dislike this monitization model. This gives way more to you then most AAA games do for a lower cost.

I personally am tired of other skinner box games and find this refreshing.
Great game. Richard Garfield did it again. Fun, enjoyable, and not tremendously expensive. $20 entry apparently ruffles everyone's feathers, but it's quite accessible and enjoyable. You can have tons of fun after putting in just the entry fee and never feel super forced to do more. It's just fun. You can buy more cards on the steam market easily (just unload some of the steam game trading cards)
As someone with a strong Hearthstone and MTG background, I have to say that this is one of the most amazing card games I've ever played. The game has the perfect balance of skill and luck which results in every game you play to be exciting. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to get into an online card game.
Hello Card Game users !
You might just stop criticising something you've never tried just like sex
Try it and you'll love it !
P.S Nothing is free-to-play in 2018
Great game i love it. 5/5

Graghics and gameplay mechanics are choice. Prices on content our very reasonable and affordable. Dont change a thing Valve, the haters are just going to hate.
Let's call Artifact what it is, it's a digital trading card game.  The pack cost of $1.99 each is a bit steep, and there are some heros and deck builds that are just plain out of reach without good RNG on pack purchases, or buying from the steam store at some pretty hefty prices.  As of now, Axe is a good $15+.  Having opened 35 packs, I'm just not sure on this one.  The game is fun; don't get me wrong, but it's going to be pretty darn expensive to enjoy.  I'd guess that new packs will feature new heroes and cards, and that if RNG is not on your side, you'll be continually over spending on packs or making transactions on the marketplace.  I hate to make the comparison, but it feels a whole lot like the Diablo 3 marketplace that Blizzard eventually removed all together due to its adverse impact on the game.

/** 20 Hour Gampelay Update **/
With 20 hours on record, there is absolutely no doubt that this game is amazingly fun!  I enjoy the strategy and the complexity of the card game itself.  It takes a good dozen matches before I think you really latch onto what is happening in the game.  That being said, I like the expert games with the reward payouts.  That means, you guessed it, more money spent on tickets.  Unlike packs, a 5 set of tickets is 4.99; so call them a buck a piece.  If you win 3 games before you lose 2, you get your ticket back; otherwise you don't get anything.  At 4 or 5 wins before 2 losses, you can claim a ticket + 1 or 2 card packs respectively.  Right now, my deck isn't as solid as I'd like; so I'm running about 2/5 on actually getting a pack out of it.  What does that mean?  Well, it means I'd of been better off buying the packs.  

For those debating on rather they should buy the game or not, keep it in perspective.  You need to spend money for cards, period.  No matter how you get them, they cost money.  However, the game is fun.  When there are some cash shop improvements, I will likely change my review to a thumbs up recommendation.  I just can't recommend a game that I'm $70 into already, and I still don't have the deck I want to build due to card RNG.  Many people, rightfully so, don't want to invest that kind of money into a digital TCG.

/** 12/21/2018 Patch Update **/

Ok, they finally fixed a lot of the early game pack monetization by adding levels to the game that give you rewards based upon your obtained level.  You can get card packs as well as tickets for the various levels of progression.  The biggest issue I have with this at the moment is that rewards seem to drop off after level 16.  AKA - you only earn an extra 15 packs from the leveling / progression system.  That may because of the early introduction of the system in this latest patch, but so far so good.  The balances in this patch seem reasonable as well.  You can start to feel the meta dynamics come to play, and understand why a dynamic play style will be important for quality players.
This is a good TCG game and only one that I really enjoy playing. The hate is and bad reviews are so biased and subjective. You don't need to pay anything above the price to play it and to have fun.
$20 and you can phantom draft for forever. Constructed players are a bit out of luck with free stuff, but the game's so polished that that I'm more than satisfied already.
This game has one of the best monetization models in the card game industry. Here are some of the reasons:

- Free phantom drafting with the only restriction being a 30 minute cooldown to prevent abandoning decks
- A 1 ticket phantom draft where a 50% winrate nets you profit and you can go infinite in
- Can directly purchase cards. Don't have to pray to loot gods to get the cards you want
- Allowed to draft with friends for free
- Playing competitvely is optional and completely unnecessary for rewards
- A one time buy in instead of a predatory F2P model

The biggest problem currently is the price of constructed decks. A meta deck can cost upwards of $100. If you are looking to play because of constructed and don't want to pay money every few months to keep up I wouldn't recommend this game. However if you are a limited play fan, this is the game.
Amazing game. Deep gameplay, and the draft mode allows you to play every card in the game for your $20. Only spend extra if you want and you can recoup costs at every turn. Would recommend.
I feel like most reviews are coming from an era of most online card games being a grindy, 'do your dailies to get handouts' model.

While some games do this better than others, Artifact just went the other route, simiar to MTGO. Pay to get in, buy your cards.

This isn't nessicarly P2W, it's just the model of the game. Same way phyiscal MTG works.

If you don't like that model applied to a digital card game, that's fine, but I think this game is mainly targeting 'Spike' MTG players.
Short review to defend Valve's monetization from idiots who are used to F2P models, will probably update in months to come.

GAME:

Game quality is excellent.

Some RNG certainly sucks, the worst of which is what you're offered in the consumable hops.  3G TP scrolls make a nd break the game.

MONETIZATION:

People are upset about the monetization of a TCG that represents paper cards.  This is the first and only digital TCG where you're able to buy and sell any individual card, just like a paper TCG.  If you're done with the game, you can sell all your cards on the market, for example.

Who this TRULY sucks for is for the true F2P people, meaning young kids w/o jobs and money, and also people from less fortunate countries like places in South America and Eastern Europe where they feed themselves on $20 USD.

While it sucks the cost to play is extremely significant, this is how life is.  If you're reading this, you probably speak English, so be thankful that you're fortunate and have opportunity to better yourself instead of stuck in an economically depressed region where people make $500 USD a month.

For the game itself, the cost is excellent and also very fair.  No games will let you complete a collection or buy individual cards for your decks as inexpensively as Artifact.

Day 1, prices were be expensive, like Axe has stabilized at $15, but come one or two months later, all the rares outside of a few will be under $0.25 USD.  Most of the trash rares are already that cheap.  Outside of the top 10 cards, no other card costs $2 even, and that's only day 2.  Prices will continue to fall as supply is basically endless from people playing draft and opening packs.

You can buy 3 x all the uncommons and commons for under $10 already on day 2.

If you enjoy TCGS like HS or Magic, this is a great game.  The other TCG I enjoyed the most was Duelyst, but the developers went to sh1t.

This game is great if you're seriously into card games. It's the deepest and most skill-intensive card game I've played, and I have played Hearthstone, Eternal, MtG, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and Pokemon at competitive levels. If you're more of a casual TCG player, the base game is great for the draft experience, but you have to be willing to put in the money expected of paper TCGs (or become a god at draft to grind expert draft gauntlets) to build a collection for the full experience of constructed play.
This game is fun as hell. A fresh take on the card game format. They do alot of new and interesting changes to the stuff youre used to. three lanes of play, an equipment system, heroes and their effects on gameplay workin that Highlander vibe. this is a daunting amount of stuff to be aware of, but the tutorial, combined with a brilliant, smooth UI system keeps the info coming at an easy pace. any questions? just double click the thing at it takes you to the cards personal page where everything is neatly explained to you.

Once you actually get into some games you realize you can take some of these strategies super deep. Valve has this bad habit of making games with a stupid level of detail and attention to the design and this game is no exception. The game clearly promotes preparation, improvisation and strategising over just picking all the best cards and stuffing them into a deck.

Im really interested in this game. it feels like theyre only scratching the surface of what this format can do and im excited to see where the game goes from here.
The monetization system is not bad. People complaining that this is not free to play are the reason why so many companies are turning to systems that MILK money out of your pockets. Hearthstone requires 50 dollars each expansion by itself, that only gets you around half of that seasons collection! Artifact has a great trading system and 20 dollars for the content plus hours of fun is definitely worth the price.

However, I do have some concerns about gameplay. The social aspect is very lacking. You are unable to communicate with opponents and the matches seem to make you a bit lonely as time goes on. Also, the gameplay takes really long. Each game easily goes 30 minutes and that's a huge amount of time. 

I believe this game is on a path for success.
Best game I have ever played, from the bottom of my heart thank you valve. This is my first card game and I hope you can hear the people who love the game as well as the people who have issues with the monitization in particlual. This game is only 20$ and it is so much more fun than dota 2 because you dont have to depend on 4 other toxic ragers lmao. I love strategy and i played all the civ games eu3 eu4, etc.... and this is very fun for me. I know you guys will introduce even more cards, layers to gameplay and etc and am looking very much forward to it. I have been playing all night all day got 4 hours of sleep i think i am addicted, and I dont even fully understand 1 color card deck yet and there are 4! nevermind actually building agro decks control decks healing decks with my favoirite cards, look forward to it. I am PLAYING THIS ALL FOR FREE, with the DRAFT MODE. You dont have to spend a cent if you dont want to.  AND who cares if I end up spending 20$ total over the year on gauntlets and tournaments. ITS THE PLAYERS CHOICE TO ENTER. IF YOU GO 4-2 YOU GET YOUR TICKET BACK AND A PACK LOL. WHO SAID YOU GOTTA GO BUY 40$ AXE CARD. people are mad at nothing. I played dota for years and i spent like 20-40 dollars on a few skins over my whole career, And it enhanced my ENJOYMENT. NOT MANDATORY.  WAIT A MINUTE, YOU GUYS WANT THEM TO GIVE YOU ALL THE CARDS FOR FREE, AND A FREE GAME? ROFL WHY?????????????????? WHO GIVES YOU A FREE GAME??????? NINTENDO??????
Fantastic Game in terms of the base set, can use every card in the game for free in the casual draft, Spent $150 Canadian to complete the entire collection, and have since earned $50 of that back from playing expert and selling off my pack winnings. The game is nowhere no more pay to win than hearthstone is, plus you can trade in 20 of your useless cards for an event ticket that can lead to another event ticket, and 2 free packs if you're skilled enough. The grind is not for time, the grind is for skill.
Game is absolutely amazing, im loving every second of it! 

Dont mind the complaints, those are the people that try to whine when every game launch. 
There is nothing wrong with the game nor the buying/selling the cards and there is alot of different gamemodes to play and to get good in so you can play drafts and constructed and earn free packs!
I was waiting for this game since ti7 announment. Watched few streams etc, but once you start playing you will not want to stop... so GOOD.

Need to think 10steps ahead sometimes, pleasure to play.
Well, 10 hours in and I feel like I sort of know what I'm doing, which is nice. Been mostly drafting, and I've never played dota, just other card games. 

I don't really get everyones issues about p2win, since as far as digital card games go, this is probably by far the cheapest of the bunch to be competitive in if you also have a life (and I say this as someone who does not in fact have a life, but does have rather excellent card collections in SolForge, Hearthstone, MtGA, Eternal and other games without ever paying for them). Yes, it is not free to play. But I dont really get why everyone would feel entitled to play for free anyway, when there has been real work put into the game and SOMEBODY will have to pay for that work. What the system does is to more fairly distribute those costs among all the players. Everybody pays, but nobody pays very much. Seems ok to me.

The game is... interesting so far.  It's enough different from other games to feel fresh, but it is still a card game. You still have mana, still play creatures, still bash your opponents life total. It doesnt play THAT differently, and it's not actually all that crazily complex. Sure it's not Hearthstone and it is more aggressively complex in its base rules than Magic, but I'm not convinced it's harder to get into or play. It's fun though.  I reserve jugdment on balancing until I feel like I can confidently say that my bouts of frustration are not simply from me being bad at the game.

Now, my main issue so far is that it feels kinda slow. The reason for that are the many MANY animations happening all over the board all the time. The transition between lanes takes absolutely forever, the towers exploding takes painfully slow seconds and... well, everything is just really really slow, which is awful because so very little actually happens in every turn. I feel like 2/3 of a game is just waiting around for animations and it's been driving me nuts. It's ok for a few games at a time, but this is actually the first card game I've ever played that I cannot keep at for more than 2 hours or so at a time.

Awesome game! Such a refreshment coming from Hearthstone to this. 3 boards makes shitty RNG a lot less of a factor than in other games, i feel it is much more skill based since you can always make a move on 1 of the 3 boards. I also love the monatization of this game, no more praying to RNG jesus while openeing packs, want a certain deck? Buy the cards on the marketplace..most cards are like 0.03cent lol!
anyway ATM for me this is the best card game on the market, the most "competitive" one for sure. The strategy goes really deep.
It's rare that in a card game I feel like I'm actually outplaying my opponent rather than simply drawing better cards. This is a thing of beauty. People might be complaining about monetization, but you can buy most cards for a few cents, or just play the totally free draft mode or use the surprisingly fun preconstructed event decks.
Pretty fun so far. Most decks can be made under ten bucks. Cheaper than most f2p cards games if you account for grinding time. Hard to figure out and takes a while to start digging into the meat of the mechanics. Very different game than MTG, Heartstone, and Shadowverse. Most similar to Gwent but mostly just the math portion. Matches usually takes much longe and RNG feels high at first but averages out over time. The random arrows system doesn't feel great and can makes a huge impact on the match. 

I wish there was a story mode, but bot matches are pretty robust; allowing you to give the bots any cards outside your collection. It's not a great game, but good. I hope they continue to add more mechanics and make it feel less mathy. There is too much math in the game and a lot of effects are just numerial and boring. Infinite casual draft is great, but penalty for leaving a draft is too generious. People would just draft and drop if their build sucks; there is only a 30 min penalty. 

Market place is a neat system. Only a handful of cards cost over a dollar and only a couple are over 10.  This system isn't for everyone, f2p gamers are going to hate it. There is a lot people who would prefer to grind everyday for a month to make a deck then to spend a cent. Take if from a Magic the Gathering Arena player, this system is much better and cheaper if you value your time. 

However, this game doesn't provide any dopamine rush(eg.reward packs and tickets) unless you play the expert modes that require you to buy in with packs and/or tickets. There is no reward system for casual play. I can understand not giving out packs for free for casual play, but at least give me ways to unlock achievements or icons((I need my dopamine fix). 

It's a good game, but feels more like a board game than a cards game. 7.5/10(5 is average)
As someone who doesnt have the time or drive to grind out cards like in games like hearthstone/mtg arena, having the ability to buy whole deck at a much much cheeper price than either hearthstone or mtg is very very nice. I probably wont even be doing that though as i spend most of my time playing the monthly featured decks and drafting. If you didnt care about your card collection because you were going to mostly play featured decks or draft you would probably make back around 60-80% of your purchase price just by selling the packs you got for buying the game. I got an Axe (25CAD) and some dire priestest(12CAD) so i came out with a bit of a profit, though most people will probably get around 60% back fairly easily.
Awesome card game with better monetisation than its competitors. Draft mode is free and is a lot of fun. The gameplay has a tremendous amount of depth (this can be a bit overwhelming initially), the three lane system creates lots of meaningful decisions and opportunities to outwit your opponent. Graphics and sound are superb.
Alot of fun. Flexible system makes it tempting to keep tinkering and trying different decks and approaches to win a game. Satisfying and addictive gameplay. Different modes offer different flavors. Games are usually mind bending and little decisions could end up making all the difference. It is the spirit of DotA well captured in a card game. I'm excited to see what's coming if the starting point is this good.

Monetization: instead of defending or flaming, I suggest you read about the different features in the game before judging (preconstructed, phantom draft etc). Additionally, the community market and deck lending. Personally, it is cheapest card game I ever tried. Including "F2P" ones like Hearthstone.
Seems to be a great game.
The cries about the price are *mostly* unwarrented. Do some research on the topic instead of using the steam reviews as gospel.
Great Game Very Fun, Guys please give it a chance and let it grow on you!!!

Btw i wish game animations look like the trailer, the trailer looks epic!!!!
I'm a bit surprised at how much fun I'm having with this game. The only downside to the entire experience (which can be an upside) is how complicated and difficult it can be to learn the game. Thankfully, the in-game tutorial is good enough to bridge the gap most of the way and there's a lot of streamers who have been showing the ropes.

If you enjoy TCG's, don't let the monetization model scare you off - you can sell your excess cards in-game and most of the other cards go for cents, with one or two exceptions. It's worth exploring if you enjoy complex but rewarding games.
Really in-depth game. Probably not great if you're looking for something to play casually/distracted, but if you want to a game where you can zone in and wrack your brain, it's great. Somewhere between MTG and Chess. RNG isn't as bad as it seems at first glance.
Really depth card game. Best out there at the moment. Monetization model is actually the best, too. It is transparent and at the end, under the line, cheaper than its competitors.
Very very good so far, deep gameplay, lots of strategic options, I'm not a fan of "Free" to play mass grinding which helps for me.
Slick UI and Dota 2 players will feel at home.
As far as card games go, the monetization is the best in the industry. You buy cards you want without ever having to spend a dime on gambling with packs. It's undeniably pay to win, but if your fine with that the game is fantastic
This game is excellent! The negative reviews are mostly people who want a F2P model.  
This is a better game overall- more strategy, better features and design, than hearthstone.  It is more fair and direct with its monetization.  Give it a try if you’ve ever played hearthstone.  I can’t go back.  

Artifact feels like chess where HS is just checkers.
Strategically deep game with exciting battle system and beautiful polished audiovisuals. Also, no grind required. It's the best card game in years and Valve is just getting started.
This is a really fun game. It is sad there is so much "credit card wins" reviews, this is much more reasonabley priced than MTG and there are actually fun and interesting ways to play with all the cards without spending more money than the cost of the game. I also love how I can, if I want to play constructed, choose cards from the market place (usually for less than $0.10!) to buy and build decks rather than grind for hours for those 2 - 3 cards I want to play in my deck.
Obviously where they take it from here (expansions and updates) is yet to be seen and could destroy this great game but hopefully they keep doing what they're doing.
Artifact is the right blend of fun and challenging.  Clearly the game has a lot of depth.  Decisions feel consequential, and occasionally even stressful, but exhilirating at times.  It actually reminds me of the feeling I get from Dota.
The game is fun. If you want to play it for fun then the free draft mode is worth the price in my opinion. I'm also looking forward to playing in/hosting some custom tournaments (e.g. common only - a deck would cost less than 1 dollar, excluding the packs you get with the initial game purchase). These two modes/features should be in more (all) card games. As long as the free draft always includes the most recent sets I'll continue to recommend this game and drop a few dollars if and when I'm in the mood as a thank you.
One improvement would be to make the tutorial and perhaps X free draft games as a demo so people can actually try out the game before purchasing.
10/10 great card game. Monetization my ass. They set it up exactly like a very prominent physical cards game. If you wanna play draft night you gotta pay to play. Get the fuck outta here with negative reviews. You wanna play spend some money.
I am no expert in the game and have only played the game for about 6 hours, but as someone who has always had an avid love for trading card games, I feel like valve has done an excellent job. The visual polish, complexity, and overall flow of the game feels amazing. Now, the largest complaint that everyone talks about is the fact that there is no way to propetually play this game for free, and that you must pay to play competitively. For a pack of 5 event tickets, I believe the cost is $4.99, so ultimately the cost is $1 per Phantom Draft. So you drop one event ticket to draft up a deck, which takes a minnimum of about an hour if you are even slightly trying. Now if you are terrible at the game, like me, you go through your gaunlet and say you win one game and then loose your final two. At roughly 20 (or even more) minutes a game, that is 1 hour.  So between drafting and your three games, you got about two highly entertaining hours of play......for $1. Now you go play endless Casual Phantom Draft for free, and try again when you are better. I highly recommend the game for anyone that enjoys TCGs, and enjoys a challenge. But, that is just my 2 cents.....
Very fun and mechanically sound card game. I don't mind the monetesation, it's very similar to Magic: the Gathering in my opinion and because of the ability to trade/sell cards it seems like it will be worth it in the longrun.
I love the depth of this game over other digital TCGs.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/a1ikq9/artifact_has_the_best_monetization_model_of_any/
Pretty easy to pick up, has new and different win conditions than what's out there, obviously a very high skill cap. Really enjoying it and looking forward to playing for a long time.
This is such a difficult review to write because there are two parts. The game part and the monetization part. One is brilliant, the other is awful. No second guesses on which is which.

A) The game of Artifact is brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. It fuses the best from MTG, Hearthstone and DOTA into a deep and interesting game that's visually polished and beautifully balanced. It's not for your toilet warriors in Hearthstone. Games take a long time, they require you to think and plan but the reward is great. I felt like I backdoored a core successfully after setting up a decoy that lured my opponent to overcommit in one lane. 

Stuff like that is like watching a wonderful trap in chess come to life and is the lifeblood of any strategy game player. First game, and I got that rush and I love it. It has so much depth, some RNG, but it always feels as though you have the ability with some clever plays to turn around a losing position.

B) Sadly, we must talk about the elephant in the room. The monetization model for the game is really poor and you feel it too within almost immediately. After you've played through the tutorial and maybe browsed the cards a bit, you soon realize... I can't get any more cards if I don't pay for them. It really hurts a player's enthusiasm for a game when they can't keep playing and unlock more of the features. I'm entirely gated off from constructed at the moment as I refuse to pay for extra packs or cards at this time. 

So why am I recommending it?

Two reasons. 

1. Free phantom draft. I initially canceled my preorder of the game, but changed my mind after I saw Valve include this for launch. It's amazing really that they allowed this through, because draft is where the game shines and the free phantom draft mode is so enjoyable that I honestly feel it's worth $20 just for that. 

2. I have faith they will fix it. The speediness of Valve in adding in some features like the free phantom draft gives me hope they will find a way to balance this out. A game this good should not be missed by card game enthusiasts. If it keeps a healthy player base, the draft mode in this game is AAA quality, and when Valve find that perfect balance -- perhaps a new progression system -- it will be the best digital card game on the market.

Heck, it might already be in terms of gameplay. But we're still a ways to go before we have the full package.
fun and challenging game. Play free casual draft to prepare for expert draft, and wait a few weeks and buy cheap cards on the marketplace for constructed.
Excellent video game. Extremely competitive, and very deep in theorycrafting and execution. There's a little bit of luck involved in your draws, and there's a little bit of luck involved in how your first lanes randomize, but other than that, sheer skill and strategy.

As someone coming back into the card game genre from a 20 year hiatus (Magic in the 90's), I can tell you that this definitely has the feel of old school card games. While it doesn't seem to be tradeable, that there's a mode where players draft random cards and put together the best deck they can seems to solve any perceivable problem in finances preventing good decks.

The market place seems really well fleshed out for deck-building, and dirt cheap at that. I'm hoping to see some cards jump up drastically in value as the game goes on, because as-is, you could build pretty much any conceivable deck for next to nothing compared to real life card games. $50 for the most expensive possible decks, if you bought every single card? I experimented with building an new deck from scratch, built around cards I don't even have, and the total came out to like $4.00, including several rares.

There's a way to get access to cards free-of-charge in the form of tickets, but they're finite. If you aren't good enough you won't get new tickets, and will have to buy them. This seems to be the sole-reason for people complaining. Part of me likes this though. I would be turned-off if there was a carrot-stick gimmick in this game. I'd rather just play it because its fun, not because I want to grind out e-bucks for 200 hours so I can get e-cards valued at a whopping $5.00.
It's well thought out, great gameplay and great idiot blocker on deck builder. Given that everyone on the internet has an opinion on this game, I say play it for yourself. If you don't like it, just refund it. If you like it, congrats! You found a new game you like. I know card games aren't everyones cup of tea, but that's what opinions are for and my opinion is that I like this game.
Really fun card game with lots of interesting choices. Don't listen to what everybody says about the monetization strategy. First of all it's a card game, secondly you don't actually lose the value since you can sell the cards, lastly it's a lot cheaper than getting equally good cards in Hearthstone.
the best collectable card game without scummy monetization
fun and addictive
you can sell or buy cards on market,or change into tickets for competitive runs
no need to login every day to grind for the peanuts other games give,just play what you find fun

the 20$ are worth it, the monetization can be a little bit expensive but you don't need to be competitive, you can play casual and avoid spending more than the starter 20, in fact if you're lucky you could even get cards and sell them for more than 20... i feel like a lot of ppl here are used to the free to play card games and justhate the monetization.
You have to pay for the game, which gets you something like 4-5 card packs, then buy more packs to play.
Its like a IRL card game where you have to pay for cards even if youve never played b4.
I dont think its that wacky but people really seem to not like having to pay for the cards.

The game itsself is just a more complex magic the gathering, without counter spell cards. At least thats my first impressions
It aight
There is no debate that the game is great. It's the best TCG I've ever played (previously: MTG, Gwent, HS, Pokemon, Shadowverse...). Simple mechanics and great depth of gameplay. It looks great and really polished, too.

The monetization is fair. Not overpriced, and you can draft forever for free. That already is worth it, and getting singles in the market will be pretty cheap overtime IMO.
20 dollars allows you to play draft (the most competetive mode) for free with all cards available. If you wan't to build a competetive constructed deck you can buy only the cards you need instead of lootbox mechanics making the cost of a deck incredibly high. Or f2p where you grind for years to finally complete an outdated deck. You can recycle 20 cards for a free gauntlet run with rewards. It's not a free to play game but all this crying about having to pay 20 dollars to play a game is insane. 

It basically comes down to what is your time worth? I would think most people find their time to be worth more than a few dollars here and there for a competetive run as opposed to countless hours to save a couple bucks.
The largest gripe I've encountered regarding the game, has nothing to do with it's mechanics or gameplay, but rather the cost. Some may see the pricetag and walk away, or find out you have to buy cards in order to obtain them and do the same. The thing is, those cards you're buying, outside of a few rares which are totally unnecessary to build and play a competitive deck, cost between .04 and .07 dollars. 

Legit, you could search your cup holders in your car, empty our your pockets, and look around your furniture and find enough loose change to buy upwards of 20-30 cards. You can spend money on packs if you want, but it's totally unnecessary, seriously, just buy the cards you want. If you want to play the "expert" modes, feel free, a ticket costs a dollar, and if you can go 3-2, you make your money back in a new ticket and possibly additional $2 packs. Keeper draft (where you draft and keep your deck afterwards) does cost a good bit more, however, it does have much higher payouts compared to the other modes, and its main benefit, where you get to keep the drafted cards, is sort of unnecessary when you consider the card pool isn't massive right now and you can buy whatever you want for a nickel. 

Mechanically I'm still trying to understand the game and balance of plays, but a majority of my games have been tooth and nail until the very last turn, often winning right before my enemy could make the finishing blow or vice versa. It's intense! You have the interaction of gwent and mtg in the form of passing turns, without any of the landscrew or mana tap issues that plagues magic. There are tons of different strategies and combinations between the heroes and their respective colors, all of which work. Some match-ups you face are gonna be harder than others, sometimes you get blown out early game, but even then, you can claw and fight your way back to grab a last second win.

Also, you get a fuck ton of pre-constructed event decks with some of the best heroes anyways you can play with for free, all of which have a nifty feature that lets you buy the deck if you want, by auto-grabbing the cheapest copies of those cards from the steam market place. You also have the options to set up totally free draft tournaments and the like with friends, all while playing and making your own house rules.

TL:DR Initial cost reflects the 10 pack 5 ticket welcome package ($25 value), cards cost less than 8 cents, all gamemodes are free, preconstructed competitive decks for free, 60% winrate (3-2) needed to go infinite in "expert" mode.
I've played a lot of card games over the years - most rcently MTGA, and Artifact holds it's own. It has a very unique twist with a lot of strategic depth.
I have been waiting for this game to release since they annunced it almost 2 year ago. I knew that valve had the means and with richard garfields help, the know how to make the next best DCG. 

I had played magic for years, but in the last few years it became much to expensive between card prices and travel expense to continue. So I went into the DCG world, starting with MTGO, but was just as expensive as MTG, and soon found Solforge. I instantly fell in love with that game, but the develop was awful. They destroyed their own game. Then into Hearthstone and Eternal I went. HS was fun, for a while. But became boring and simple very quickly, on top of that the decks cost almost as much as a magic deck and You need 5 to play at the competative level. And eternal developed have ruined their own competative scene. 

So enter Artifact, no game has ever promised and delived eveything it advertised. Its a rich, and depp game that while it isnt free at all, is very const effective. And manages to hold onto the "premier" card game feel of MTG. Easy 10/10, I love it, and will stay with it as long as I can.
This game is a ton a fun, if you are on the edge of whether to pick it up or not... PICK IT UP! 20 bucks gets you some free packs, but if you are in it for the draft mode its WELL WORTH YOUR MONEY. After you blow your ticket in expert play, head on down to f2p phantom draft mode. Endless hours of fun
So, I've made back more money than the $20 dollar buy-in and I've played more than 40 hours. Seems like decent value to me.

Not a constructed player tho. Draft 4 lyfe.
Thankfully, Valve has changed their stance on the monetization of the game and things seem to be looking up for the game. The game has had some trouble keeping a steady player count but personally I've never had issues finding a game in less than 30 seconds or so.

The game is heavily RNG based which can be very frustrating at times but overall I've enjoyed my time with the game and I continue to play a game or two every once in a while when I'm not busy playing Dota.

OLD REVIEW:
A great game which is unfortunately plagued by a terrible monetisation scheme. Likely going to steer away from any future Valve products if this is the example that they've set for their new standard of games.
Everyone complaining about the monetization model has no idea what they're talking about. You do not have to buy RNG packs to get the cards, you can buy every card individually on the Steam marketplace, and most cards are less than 10 cents there. Sure, powerful cards like Axe are more expensive, but that's what a player-driven economy is supposed to do.
An absolutely amazing game. From start to finish, gameplay is fantastic, and super in depth. The amount of skill and control it takes to successfully maneuver three different lanes at once is amazing.  And this is all coming from someone who hasn't played constructed. You don't need to dump money into this game to have fun. I've been having a blast with expert phantom drafts, and if you still can't go infinite, or don't want to drop a little money on tickets, you can play a similar mode for free.

I think the monetization is actually pretty decent. As most people point out, "you have to pay to get the game, in which you have to pay to open more packs." However that's where I disagree.  First off, as mentioned before, you can play casual draft for free as much as you want. Second, deckbuilding is not that expensive if you don't buy packs. Just buy the specific cards you want off the market for cheap and you're good to go.

Overall I've had a great experience and would reccomend it to any competitive TCG player, as well as any casual player that doesn't mind dropping the initial $20.
At first I laughed at Valve when they announced it. And I pre-ordered it a few days ago because I got so hyped.

I am so happy with this game. It is what I always wanted of a CCG/TCG. It has the feeling if a real-life card game, but it's digital and still brings such excitement and joy of playing it. The gameplay is fluid, interesting, complex and full of interesting encounters and turnarounds.

A lot of people say it's p2w. IT IS NOT. It is what a card game should be - you purchase a base deck with some boosters (you get 2 decks and 10 boosters, which are valued more than the $20 you pay for the game) and you can buy booster packs containing 12 cards for $2 each, OR buy individual cards from the Steam Marketplace, which creates a market for the game which is controlled by the players.

The game's complex 3-lane board and 2 towers on each lane is a classic card game representation of a MOBA, just like they meant it to be. It might seem intimidating, but it's lots of fun and quite interesting and a welcome change from all the other card games out there.

There are lots of ways to build a deck - there are 4 categories of cards, distinguished by a card's color. You have control, aggro, support or lategame and gold. You can mix-match all colors, or you can play only 1 color - it's all up to you. The recommended way is you build 2 colors.

And just like in a MOBA you have 5 heroes which go in separate lanes (there is a possibility to have all 5 heroes on 1 lane, but it's uncommon and requires playing cards with specific effects). There are creeps you can spawn and which spawn randomly each turn. There are items, which are representative of the Dota 2 game's shop (there's also a hidden shop item shown each turn).

For game modes, there are plenty:
[b]Social Play[/b] which includes:
[list]
[*] user-organized tournaments which have a set of rules specified by the creator
[*] private lobbies you can invite your friends into
[*] open play which gives you the opportunity to open a room to all your friends or a Steam community to play with you
[/list]

[b]Casual Play[/b]:
[list]
[*] playing versus bots to test decks or just train yourself to become btter if you don't want to face real opponents
[*] global matchmaking which matches you with another player
[*] Gauntlet, which has a set of specific rules and gives you a deck or a choice of a few decks to play with
[/list]

Now, the last one is called [b]expert play[/b] - this is where the real game is. This is what most will call the ranked play. However, it requires an entry ticket (one of them requires booster packs as well, but I'll get into that in a bit) which is purchased with real money - $5 per 5 tickets (you are given 5 tickets with your initial purchase). The goal is to win 3 to 5 games before losing 2 games. Here are the available game modes:
[list]
[*] constructed - you build a deck and compete against other players
[*] phantom draft - build a deck by picking cards from a series of cards which are given to you from a random pool to choose from
[*] keeper draft (2 tickets, 5 packs) - you again pick from a series of cards, but this time it's the cards from the packs you opened, you also keep all the cards you pick!
[/list]

Entry tickets are what a lot of people are angry about. But it's not bad, it's very well thought out:
When you play expert games, you pay an entry fee which is usually just 1 ticket. For winning 3 games before losing 2, you get your ticket back. For 4 games you win a booster pack. And for 5 games - 2 booster packs.
For keeper draft, it's different since it requires 2 tickets, so:
3 wins - 2 tickets + 1 pack; 4 wins - 2 tickets + 2 packs; 5 wins - 2 tickets + 3 packs.

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]
This game is awesome, has great potential, NOT P2W, $20 is a great price for this game.
I danced my monkey ass off to get into the closed beta and it was worth it. Fantastic game. Matches are intense and exciting, every single game plays differently. I've been waiting for years for a great online TCG and it has finally arrived!
Absolute blast of a game. Strategy is the keyword here.
Very deep and complex, you will not figure it out right away.
Can be a bit daunting but boy is it satisfying when you figure it out and win a close game by makng a clutch move.
You can get lost in it for hours, it's so much fun.
Deep, interesting strategic card game with significant replayability. Access to draft mode for free allows infinite replayability, and the whole set of cars can be purchased for far less than it would cost in normal digital CCGs.
GReat stuff, if a little overwhelming at first. The economy seems just fine, I guess people enjoy grinding hundreds of packs to get one card vs paying $5?
Awesome card game. People complaining about the monetization of this game are just butthurt that it's not a free to play game. By making everyone pay, it evenly distributes the cost to develop among the entire player base. The developers won't be dependent on whales dumping 100s of dollars into the game and the majority of people never paying a thing. The monetization decision they went with was great for the average player, because it means you can purchase a competitive deck through the marketplace for a reasonable price.

Also, this game is just so much fun to play. If you really don't want to spend anything, draft mode is arguably the most fun mode to play in and that is completely free! This game has so much more depth than other card games I've played. It seems more complex than Magic the Gathering, but manageable because the computer tracks everything for you. So you just get more time to make your decisions!
Artifact is everything I wanted it to be, it's complex and cerebral in a way that so many games are not these days, every game truly feels like a battle of the wits. As far as monetisation goes I have played the game for 10 hours now and have not spent after the initial purchase, there are plenty of free modes to try. I personally have been playing expert draft, of the 3 tickets I spent I have won back 2 and 3 packs, an additional 5 tickets costs £3.95, hardly bank breaking. There are ways to play that don't cost much money, if you don't want to spend money on packs and singles then don't.
Really great mechanics and fun ways to outplay your opponents.  Monetization works really well for me.  You don't have to grind for weeks and still not get the specific card you want.  Great free draft mode.  Definitely worth the purchase.
[b] Note to the reader... [/b]
I feel like I need to put some major shortsightedness of those who are reviewing the game.
It is extremely important to note this game is a TCG, it is a TCG no different than Magic: The Gathering, Yu-Gi-Oh, or even Pokemon Trading Card Game. IT IS NOT a CCG like Hearthstone, Tyrant, or Gwent. Many people who are reviewing are trying to compare the game's marketing to that of Hearthstone. 
...Which is like trying to compare donating to Goodwill with donating to a charity. 

[b] You will likely enjoy this game if...[/b]
... you are one who enjoys drafting rather than constructed.
... you like to play TCG on a tabletop medium and are aware of the costs involved in playing a game like that.
... you enjoy games the require careful planning and forethought.
... you enjoy the same above and like dota.
... you would like to play a TCG with friends that you otherwise couldn't play games with in person.
... you like games that were created by the legend that is Richard Garfield.

[b] You will likely have a problem with this game if... [/b]
... your primary exposure to TCG's are games like Hearthstone.
... you want to only play constructed but are not willing to spend money on the cards.
... you want a game that is more relaxing and less thought provoking.
... you want to communicate with those you are playing against.

The games take anywhere from 20-60 minutes on average.

Within the game there are 2 primary game themes:
[b] Constructed [/b] - You build and play a deck of at least 40 cards with the cards you own.
[b] Draft [/b] - You open booster packs, pick two cards and receive a different boosster pack with 2 less cards, and take 2 more, rinse, wash, repeat. You do this until 5 booster packs have been used, providing you with a pool of 60 cards to build a 40-card deck. You play against others who have done the same.

Within these themes, there are two primary formats:
[b] Casual [/b] - free, no prizes
[b] Competitive [/b] - costs tickets, prizes depending on how well you play

For those who just want to play draft and don't care about constructed (similar to those who like to only play arena in hearthstone and really don't care about the rewards aside the gold it costs to play again), you can play casual draft for no cost whatsoever! Those who wish to try to get more packs can spend tickets to play competitive to earn more tickets and a few packs to expand their owned card pool. 


[b][u] TL,DR [/u][/b]
All in all, this game is extremely fun! While Artifact may seem dauntingly confusing at a glance, it is considerably easier to catch on than it seems.  If you are looking for a [u]Trading Card Game[/u] As opposed to a [u]Collectible Card Game[/u] then I can't recommend this game enough!
Great game. Best card game I played huge, props to valve. There are things that need work such as progression system/social system/ advanced spectating options. All in all game is great and I guess we need to give artifact devs some time to polish the product but it just launched yesterday so I have high hopes in the coming weeks to see updates to these systems
maybe the game is a little pay to win but is really funny and you can still win if you use your brain not all the time but enough to win some rewards in gauntlet
the people that ask for a good game but then say shit like pay to win or to complex are lame
Having not invested any money in this game, I played nonstop for 9 hours against my friend, I managed to make 5 or 6 unique decks with the cards I got from 11 packs and had a lot of fun playing against my friend on release and playing draft today. Besides some connection issues right after the game launched and delay of starting packs for some people which are temporary issues that don't affect my opinion onthe game IO am really happy with this game, 10/10 recommend, you don't need to spend money to have a lot of fun.
This game is extremly addicting , usually I find card games quite boring especially games like Gwent or Hearthstone where you have to grind for hundreds maybe thousands of hours to get a decent deck , in Artifact tho , I got 11 euros back just from the base packs I opened and 3 more from the packs I won with a ticket , and guess what I got my ticket back too so no money invested , as long as you make a good deck and you have a brain you should profit a lot from this game , a lot of people that come and hate on it are Hearthstone or Gwent fangays that like to mindlessly grind for so many hours , they don't deserve this game I hope they leave as soon as possible
TL;DR: THIS IS AWESOME AND ADDICTING AS FUCK
So far I am enjoying the game, I quit playing Hearthstone because it was becoming too much of a burden on my wallet to keep up with new expansions and changing metas. I like that Valve is giving the option buy specific cards instead of trying to open them through just packs alone.

They give you $20 worth of packs when buying them game, so you essentially are just buying your first 10 packs upfront, instead of buying into to game in a not so direct way.
I feel like no one has played a TCC before. This is one of the cheapest TCC games due to the fact you can build your deck all from the marketplace without needing to buy packs which in the end would be highly inneficient. Also the fact that there are free Draft modes, tournaments, play against friends. So many things that neither Hearthstone or even Magic the Gathering Arena has. Day 2, this has more than other online cards games, the only issue I have is the ticket system which is bluntly, absolutely stupid. Otherwise its a better system than most.
Artifact is the most strategic TCG (at least among the digitals ones) and is really fun to play and get better. Huge props to Valve for trying a new monetisation system that i think is the best thing you could hope for in a TCG, a market where you could buy singles. If you want to build a deck you know exactly what it would cost you. They could maybe add some slow progression outside of modes that cost event ticket, but even without it, there a lot you can do with the initial purchase of the game. Free draft is a huge plus.
As a long time card game player, both digital and in paper, Artifact is the first digital card game that actually seems to be trying. Between having an actual market so you can purchase exactly what you need, and having a fresh take on the genre that escapes the flaws of the original card games, Artifact is a fresh experience that is easy to learn and difficult to master. Plus it has infinite free drafting, so that is cool too.
Really fun and refreshing TGC

Payment model might be on the heavier side compared to competitors but it has its sides

I recommend this to all card game fans, could be difficult to grasp for new comers to the genre but it's nothing that few mins of YouTube doesn't fix
Super fun. It's the cheapest card gane you can play. Reviews criticizing the monetization model are stupid. It's absolutely the best monetization model ever. You can go in the steam market and buy the cards you want for cheap instead of buying hundreds of dollars in packs like all the other cards games out there. Deep strategy. Three lanes of cards and cute little deck imps.
I'm pretty thrilled with this but it isn't for everyone. I've been a huge dota player for years and always liked card games like MTG, Vs system and Hearthstone. This card game is distinctly different with its three lane system. It is fairly easy to pick up but mastering seems like it will be a challenge. I love the music, the animations and the voices of the characters. Also unlike its competitors this game does a really good job of making games seem fair and pretty close. Sometimes in MTG or Hearthstone you know if you have won or lost by turn 2 or 3. I have yet to feel that way about this game.

Fair warning unlike other card games this game is not F2P. The secondary economy allows players to buy and sell cards they dont need on the marketplace. So if you take card games seriously and want to play the best decks available it is actually cheaper to play than its competitors. However if you want to just grind out daily quests to build a collection this is not the game for you.
This game is incredible, and definitely the best digital card game on the market right now.

That being said, if you want to grind for packs or otherwise not pay extra for constructed this game is absolutely not for you and that's OK.  

If you want to buy cards it is one of the cheapest constructed card games.  If you want to play pauper or draft, this is hands down the best game you could play in terms of value for your money.


Very suprisingly valve was very fast on my critisism (and that of many other players). And has fixed its biggest flaws, within weeks.  Thereby earning its Thumbs up.

- Great game Deep gameplay
- Nice lore and atmosphere
- new leveling system to get some packs
A fantastic TCG from Valve. The market is something card game players have been asking for for years, and the free draft mode makes this an instant buy for me.

People complaining about the lack of grinding are idiots, and don't understand basic economics. If you want a second job grinding for free packs, go and play hearthstone.
An absolutely beautiful and deep TCG and I know it may not be the best for some, but for me, I also love the RNG aspect of the game.

90% people not recommending this game right now has this mindset:

$20 is too much for entry fee and saying that they haven't spent a single penny in Hearthstone and have lots of cards and are proud to be a F2P supporter and cheap gamer.

What these bean-for-brains don't realize is that not everyone's time is as valueless as theirs are since a large cut of people can't sink 8 hours a day in Hearthstone to grind in-game money for their cards.

And I'm ofc in the latter part and I'm absolutely satisfied paying a bit over $20 to make a deck that I want and be able to straight up buy a card that I want from other players instead of submitting to the only option that's available to players in a lot of CCGs for a specific card that I want: digging through countless loot crates called card packs. 

At least here, I have options and knowing that Valve knows that my time is not valueless as the other people mindlessly sinking their time into Hearthstone, I'm happy that Valve made it this way, also keeping out low quality F2P zombies.

I love the game and it has such huge potential which they are fulfilling greatly right now.
Don't let the reviews sway you from getting this game, its pay to win, just like every other TCG game, but people are sad this isnt Half-Life 3 so its bad.
All these reviews about the economy when it was clearly stated this would work just like physical MTG.  Not a big deal, exactly what I was looking for.  Game is even better than I expected.
I share a lot of other player's concerns about the monetization strategy. However I feel $20 is a fair price for unlimited casual phantom drafts, and I don't find the constructed format to be interesting enough to spend additional money on. If subsequent expansions aren't included in the casual draft mode, I certainly won't be a long term player.

I think the issue Valve is going to run into is actually that because Draft is a more compelling format than Constructed, most players have no incentive to bother accumulating a card collection at all. A "supplemented draft" mode that straddles the line between the two formats could be a good compromise.  Valve also needs to provide at least something the players can grind for, even if it is cosmetics, or  some other free to earn sign of progression, even if it has no game impact or marketplace value.

Also, unsure of the legality, but if players were offered some mechanism to "cash out" I think it would go a long way toward calming the player base, even if it meant taking a giant haircut on exchanging cards for a credit to the player's steam wallet. Or maybe valve could let players exchange cards for selected other games in limited time promotions? That way at least valve could realize the majority of the revenue, while giving players some small exit strategy.
Two-days impression: I have watched at least 100 hours of Artifact streams learning how the game worked before it came out. I used to run a Magic: The Gathering game store IRL for 3 years, so that's my card game background. 

It feels like 4-color Magic, but on 3 separate boardstates. There's a lot of neat mechanics and the like, but honestly the voice acting and tutorial/bot games are so stellar you can play it just for that. The deck builder is pretty straightforward and quick to tell you what "ideal" conditions you might consider. I prefer it over MTG: Arena because it feels like there's Story/Lore of DOTA2 and enough different ways to play that I can always find a reason to do it. 

I spent an additional $20 in packs, used some for a keeper-draft and opened the rest to build my collection, but it looks like the market has most of the cards for cheap once you know what you need. As a newbie, I prefer just packs and drafting to get better, since there's always time to buy a rare if the "need" arises.
Really good deep game. If you dont want to pay dont do it, But I dropped around 80 bucks on it, a little more than a new game, and have a lot of cards and you get commons and uncommons so cheap on the market that it isnt really a problem to get a lot of cool stuff.
A fun, complex ccg is always welcome.

My first impressions are positive, a lot of voicelines and interactions (selfisch cleric has great lines) adds a lot of charm to this nice looking game.

The fact you have 3 boards to work with and you can respawn your heroes onto different lanes is great, it helps you come back from something that would normally be a lost game if it was Hearthstone for example where you only have one board.

The UI is also great, one of the better ones in terms of visuals AND information, there is a lot of information you get like what card has been bought from the shop (golden colour), when the card was drawn and if the card has been modified with something you played.

Don't be discouraged by the fact you have to pay to play this game.
What you are paying for ,other than being able to play the game, is a starter pack with 2 premade decks, 10 card packs and 5 event tickets.
There are paid game modes where you get rewards for winning X amount of times but there are also free game modes including a free phantom draft, the catch being that you won't get any rewards and are just playing for fun.

If you disagree with the fact a digital card game is trying to be more of a real life card game in terms of the economy (paying for cards, no grind for it) then that's fine, this is an expensive hobby and even if I can't cash out for real money (you can get money on steam wallet via the market), I will still most likely use that money to buy games on Steam.
Artifact is a really well designed, intricate and extremely fun trading card game. Every game feels fresh and exciting, and the deck building is already interesting. 
The price tag might seem too high for a card game with in-app purchases, but if you are a limited player, you can have a lot of fun for the base price with the casual and the private drafts (both modes being completely free to enter).
On the other hand, if you are a constructed player and do not want to spend any additional money, look elsewhere. If you're ready to buy individual cards or packs, you will find that deck prices even right now ( at launch ) are pretty decent compared to other TCGs and even CCGs.
Great game with infinite free drafting an an extremely cheap way to get cards in the steam market place without ever needing to grind. If you don't mind paying a little for your entertainment this is the game for you, I purchased every common card in the game for less than $10 and play commons only with friends and have a blast
Quality game.  Don't listen to the money grab nay-sayers.  Legacy TCGs out there require that you buy packs and play for fun.... we've just been spoiled by gridny games for the past several years.

Artifact matches can be so incredibly exhilirating... most games come down to a final turn which will make or break you.  If you don't win in your lane of focus, your opponent could win on the next.   Do you go big or go home and play on the offensive, or do you try to stall a turn and guarentee the win in th next round?  The great thing about this game is the significant degree of choices you get to make.  Hearthstone, MTG, Eternal, and the like don't even come close.

So what are you waiting for?  Come play some games :)
This game plays nothing like the casual card games you might be used to. Your heart will beat faster, your fingers will swell, the shear intensity matched only by fast paced RTS games will overwhelm your mind.

In the end of the day there will be a sense of achievement. You got better. In a card game. Still it somehow matters
As a huge card game fan, I find Artifact to be an absolute delight. Every intricacy of gameplay is well thought out, provoking difficult and interesting choices. The system is conplex, and yet easy to take in at a glance. Garfield has clearly learned a lot from the extensive overhead of M:tG, resulting in an utterly elegant system.

Visuals are polished to a level previously enseen in a card game. Everything is smooth and gorgeous and alive. The imps have a huge variety in animations that almost make them feel like geniune spectators instead of simple UI elements.

As for the cost, I don't see why people are complaining so much. $20 and you can do as many phantom drafts as you want. If constructed is your thing, that's going to unfortunately cost more, though far less than any other CCG. Ideally they'd just charge $60 and give us every card, but the current economy is acceptable.
i didn't play much so i can't say if it's good or bad overall but i enjoy playing it 
what consern me is how much money that i need to pay to get a good deck but for now it's very good
As far as the negative reviews go, this game still has a lot more to offer than any other online TCG/CCG.

First of all, drafts are free. I'm not a big fan of constructed formats cause once the player opens the game with a card, you know what you're already up against. That doesn't happen in draft, and every other card game I've played had an entry fee for drafts. This one doesn't. Sure you don't get any rewards, but how many times have you been rewarded with free cards after beating your friend in a card game in real life? That's correct, never.

Second good thing about this is you can buy any card on the market if you wish to play constructed + apart from a very few amount of overpowered cards, most of them come cheap and you dont' have to spend hours and hours grinding *insert in-game currency name here* to buy a pack and then end up being disappointed cause you didn't get what you wanted.

People complain about paying to play for this game. You have to understand this is a tabletop TCG brought to your PC and it works as TCGs are supposed to work.
Artifact is a brilliant modern digital card game. The game is deep, highly tactical and strategic. It's a lot of fun to play. The initiative system does away with the "yawn my opponent is playing so I have to wait" but you can always react immediately. It's much more action packed and there are just so many options to consider. Having heros to start with also gives te game a lot more character.

Why all the negative reviews from people then? Well, Artifact isn't Free to Play. It costs money. People aren't used to this in the digital space anymore so they riot. They don't see that through this cards retain value as they can be sold on the steam market place. If I quit Artifact I'd be able to get my money back, or well - most of it. It's more like a physical card game in that sense. It also allows you to buy exactly the cards you need.

Sure, you can't grind your way to a top tier deck but honestly that grind isn't for me. Go play another game if that's important. Meanwhile, the initial purchase includes starter decks, boosters and the ability to play one of the most enticing modes (draft) forever for free. And there is no paying for that and no disadvantage.

Go Artifact, and thanks Valve!
One of the most unique and well designed competitive card games in recent memory. Not content to be just another Magic clone, Artifact makes bold new choices and backs them up with great execution. The mechanics are deep but easy to grasp once you play a few games, and they do a good job of playing of the DOTA theme. The unique lane based combat leads to tactical and strategic decisions that will test even card game veterans. Any fans of the genre should check this out. 

For those who aren't TCG degenerates, the $20 buy-in gets you unlimited casual drafts and drafting right now is the mode to play. Compared to Hearthstone or MTG, the monitization model is more than reasonable.
So far game has only cost me 20€ and has been a lot of fun. The game has a of depth and can be quite overwhelming for new players. I think people who enjoy the challenge of Dota will enjoy this game, too.
Valve is taking this game places. It was a bumpy start but Valve is LISTENING TO CUSTOMER FEEDBACK and making the right choices!!! Plus, they never once asked the community if they even have phones so... they're winning on that front.
I've played a couple rounds with friends smashing the starter decks together, a few casual drafts and a keeper draft. That put me at the ~9 hour mark and so far, so good. I've really been enjoying myself. Been quite some time since a new CCGs mechanical systems have given me stiff nips. I think the last two that have made me sit up and take notice would be Shadowfist and Middle Earth: The Wizards back in 1995. Now, I am definetly still in the honeymoon phase; whether this one will be as deep and maintain the same long lasting interest as the former two I mentioned (I still play 'em) remains to be seen and too early for me to objectively tell. I have no issues with the monitization model because it comes the closest to the real world model while allowing me to break the rules in one signifigant regard. I see a card I want for a deck I buy it. That's it. I don't want to churn daily quests or grind games for hours to get my cards "for free." I already have a job. I sold a rare from my keeper draft for ~$5 and bought a couple dozen cards to modify my starter decks with for a about nickle to a dime, each. Other games where you bust up your cards into cookie dust or fairy sprinkles or whatever the return rate is booty sweat. Finally, I can play phantom drafts (no retention of drafted cards) for _free_. I'm about to make my $20 bucks sit up and dance for me in a way that cannot be equalled by nearly all competitors, to date. Magic: The Gathering Online has a singles market but no free draft so nuts to that.

That being said, I can recommend a purchase for aficionados of the genre and an encouragement for the curious with spare holiday dukats to step on board. If you think your in the later camp make damn sure to not accept the event tickets and boosters that come with the account or no within-two-hours return is possible (to quote Surly Joe, "You seen 'em; you play 'em.") I'll probably make an update middle of December when formats may or may not rotate.
Game is setup like a trading card game not the standard digital card game. If you would rather buy singles that you want and play with the deck you want I highly recommend, because it has deep strategic gameplay. It plays more like a strategic board game with cards though. If you want a game where you grind free packs and pay in spurts then this game is not for you, because again its styled more as a trading card game not the standard digital card game f2p setup.
What a fucking game. Do you enjoy card games? Then Artifact is for you. I'll break down some of the features that are available to you day 1 of the game:

- Can you sell cards? Yes
- Can you trade? Not yet, not sure if it's coming, but the official FAQ says there's something coming
- Is there a ladder? No

Has:
===
- Tutorial (If you do the tutorial, don't like the game? DO NOT ACCEPT PACKS, if you accept packs you can't refund, but hopefully you like the game - you can also test the free practice draft before refunding to see if you like that)
- Selling Cards
- Converting duplicate cards into event tickets
- Free Practice Drafting (Phantom)
- Free Constructed Match Making
- Practice vs Bots
- Deck Building
- Copying decks from online into deck builder (CTRL+V)
- Purchase a deck from the deck builder to complete your deck
- Paid Export Constructed (for rewards, cost tickets as entry)
- Paid Phantom Drafting for rewards (1 ticket as entry)
- Paid Keeper Drafting for rewards (5 packs + 2 tickets -> keep all your cards from the 5 packs + chance to get your tickets back and earn a few extra packs in the process - basically a competitive way to open packs w/ higher chance of getting better cards)
- The cheapest packs in any card game. Imagine buying a pack and it has a legendary in it? Well in artifact every pack has rares in them and Rares are Artifact's version of Legendaries. So that means every pack contains a legendary essentially. Which is why the marketplace has so many cheap cards

Doesn't Have:
===========
- Person to Person trading (FAQ has some information about this coming soon)
- Ladder (Progression systems are coming)
- Get money back from selling cards into your bank/credit card (not possible, everything is just steam wallet money)


Going Infinite
===========
Essentially it's only possible to go infinite in Expert Phantom Draft because you're only investing a ticket that you can get back after 3 wins. I went 5-1 last night and it felt great. 

You can go infinite, but you can go infinite without rewards too meaning 3 wins 2 losses means you can try again, going 4-5 wins nets you packs + your ticket back.

Keeper draft there's not really an "infinite" way of drafting unless valve changes rewards. The reason is because you're providing 5 packs that you get to keep all the cards so essentially if you ignore the 5 packs it's just phantom draft except you keep the cards you've invested money in already. Think of it a cute way to open your packs & draft, it also has better cards tbh.

Last note is games last on average 20-25 minutes, mentally prepare yourself for that.

Game is balling, super skillful with a basic entry level. I'd recommend it.
I only play casual Draft that is free after the initial purchase and it's pure fun.
It's p2w if you play constructed, but that's for every TCG.
The depth and gameplay is better than any other digital trading game.

I was lucky and got back 60% of the money spent on purchasing the game from selling cards on steam market.
 Valve made a great game with peffect mechanics. In it's core it is the best digital card game ever created. A lot of people compain about monetisation .I find it is less pay2win than in other games cause you can focus on building really specific deck or low money common ones  with a decent knowledge of the rules you don't need the "top tier rare one" . I understand some people frustration by  the lacking of progression reward ( grind ) actually in the game . 
Finally the price of the entry for the "competitive" modes seems decent to be taken seriously by most of the players . 
Just take some times to get your hands one the Rules and a lot of fun is waiting for you .

amazing card game with really not nearly as bad monitisation as people claim, i actually think its one of the best, cards are super cheap, often not being more than 0.05 0.10 dollars and you can specificly buy cards, rather than opening packs and just hoping you get the one you want.

very deep in gameplay too and the presentation is lovely, from the voice acting to the cards caracter interactions to the just adorable little imps.
If you are the sort that is willing to pay for your entertainment, you wont find a cheaper card game out there. The gameplay it self is deep with constant meaningful decisions.
Since the negativity towards this game has reached levels of absurdity, i worry that those who are on truly on the fence about this game will be dissuaded by the loud and short sighted. It is only fair that they hear from someone who truly loves and embraces this game.

I have a pretty lengthy history in games and card games in general. For complexity and strategic depth, Magic is probably the best card game on the market atm. However, there is a fundamental problem with it being an analog (physical) game. Tournaments are cumbersome and time consuming in organization and execution. Cheating is still an ongoing issue. Card balance control is inelegant and relies on bannings. All of these issues can be solved by going digital which is where Artifact steps in.

The in client tournament system is revolutionary. Already there have been numerous qualifiers for decently sized tournaments (seatstory cup) and this convenient system is a boon for the amateur scene. Sites like doubledrow.com also help expedite the process and allow the general populace to easily and efficiently participate in the tournament scene.

Even the most negative detractors have a hard time criticizing the gameplay. Being an avid chess and MtG player, this game combines both of these games beautifully. The strategic and tactical depth is unparalleled. I have played Draft, Pauper and Meta constructed extensively with a respectable win rate. Pauper especially was a pleasant surprise. Playing only with commons did not detract from the experience at all while also introducing creative deckbuilding elements.

Draft is usually a card games most popular game mode and Artifact allows you to do them for free with the caveat that you will not be playing for prizes. I have also hosted a number of mini 4 man tournaments with friends (also free) and could play for some predetermined stakes.

Meta constructed is great and the most complex imo since blink dagger is such potent tool and creates a completely different dynamic as well as playing with the most powerful cards in the game.

The monetization model is the biggest sore spot and main subject of contention from the complainers. This game is best compared with MtG. Frankly, anyone who has a clue to what their talking about should know that maintaining a collention in Artifact costs a fraction of what it would cost in MtG. Also, the ability to buy and resell cards at similar values is significantly more fluid than the huge value hit players take from disenchanting cards in the card games that use card creation materials. Also, it is a nice option to have to be able to purchase specific cards that you want rather than grinding out those materials.

Yes, outside of the winnings that you may receive from events using the 5 tickets and the ten packs from your initial purchase, you have to spend to money to build a collection. But honestly with all those previous points and the fluid nature of the market, it is much easier to receive a higher return on investment than the other games. Another thing, if you have a friend who has access to a lot of cards there is a function to share decks with your friends so you can both can access all the cards from one collection. Sweet bonus, say I have 1 copy of axe but i built two decks that run a copy. You are still able to play both of those decks with your friend as if you had two copies of Axe.

Also, it is unlikely that the Artifact we currently see will remain the same for long. Valve has a history of evolving their games and adjusting to the needs of their players. Look at Dota 2 on release and what it is now. Valve has proven before that they adapt and respond to their players.

I am usually one of those people who would rather just observe that participate in the internet dialogue but when I see so much negativity towards such a beautiful game, I could not help myself. In an age where AAA games are nearing $100 and people are complaining about Artifact's pricing just boggles my mind. This game is worth every penny you choose to spend on it.
It is a pretty good "Trading Card Game".
People that say "Mimimi It is trash because i have to buy cards" ignore the fact that in "REAL" card games like "Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokémon," you also need to buy your cards.
A rare card that many people want, will cost more than a very common card no one wants. I cannot understand how people can be upset about this, Thats just the way the Economy works.

In my Opinion Artifact is the Best Trading Card Game on PC.
-It has a very refreshing Turn on the basic concept with the 3 Boards And Towers.
-It is made properly: I did not encounter a single Bug/Glitch on launchday. Everything worked Properly.
-It has a great integration of the steam market, and allows Easy, Quick, and Safe Buying/selling Options for The Cards.
-It got many different modes that allow to switch the game up if "Standard Constructed" gets boring.
-It does NOT require constant money to be played. There is a casual mode which does not require any Ticket usage.
-It is Graphicly Pleasing, The Pictures and Animations Look really good.
-(Subjectiv) I Personally really like the Soundtrack, It sounds Good, but it does not distract from the Game.
First Impressions.

I'm a big fan, gameplay wise Artifact is something else, it feels very in your face and important at almost all times, and the polish is really up there.

There are some issues for sure, lack of in game social features, a couple small bugs,  and the lack of an upfront progression system. It's been out for a day and I hope these things will get addressed but I'll give them a little time and see.

The big issue for many is the money side of it, but personally I'm happy with it, as someone who has actually spent money on cards before this game is really quite cheap, and with free phantom draft I'm super hooked.
I'm just going to leave a positive review here to try and help balance things out. If you're part of the OMFG-EVERYTHING-SHOULD-BE-F2P!!-generation that are doing their best to make sure developers can't make bread, then yeah, prolly stay away from this game. News flash! Developers need money to keep developing games. Stop fucking draining the fun out of the products by because you want everything for free. Get a fucking job or stay the fuck off card games. There's plenty of terrible games out there for you to sink your useless time into.  But I digress.. I've only sank a couple hours in so far, but my initial impressions is that this game is a legit contender for GOAT card game.

As far as costs go, it's still going to cost you less than Hearthstone and far less than MtG.
Of all the mobile card games released, this one is the most engaging i've played. Every single turn is a nail-biter and a different strategy is required each time you play, even with the same deck.

The only gripes I currently have for the game are:
-Game feels expensive, no real account progression other than buying more cards for collection. No way to earn free packs.
-Some heroes seem leaps and bounds stronger than others. Some balancing may be required (Axe).
This is definitely a card game for people who loving to think and try out different strategies. Can't understand why so many non-sense 'p2w' scams are here.
Great game. Reviewers are spamming because you need to buy the game (to stop bot accounts flooding the market and to stop you from re-rolling your 10 packs like in Shadowverse). If you have a look at the cost of the cards on the market, apart from 3 heroes, everything is of reasonable value. The Artifact community will be creating many tournamets in all kinds of formats including my favourite, Pauper which is just using commons and uncommons. 
Yes you do need to pay £16/$20 to get started but with free drafts and lots of ways to play on a budget, I really don't see why people who enjoy card games, both physical and digital, would turn their nose up at the game!
Great game feel, great concept and most of all great fun!
Chess-like. RNG seems fair. Monetization is very fair, if you want a card you can buy it for pennies rather than having to grind and get lucky by opening packs. The ability to sell your cards and "get out" is also huge.
Excellent game! As a long time Magic the Gathering player, the game is fluid, deep, and complex. Lots of potential for outplay.

The main gripe is the montization of the cards. People who are judging this model do not play TCG games. The model allows you, for a one time fee of buying the game, to play unlimited hours against friends, bots, or drafting. The only thing you would want to spend money on is if you wanted to play constructed. You literally do not have to pay a dime after buying the game unless you want a card collection. Even then, most cards are under .25c.

What other card game allows you to play with all of the cards for the cost of the game?

Fantastic game 10/10.
When people say this game has pricing and monetization issues, they are for the most part wrong. Compared to Hearthstone or Gwent or MTGA, where the only way to get cards is to buy packs either through grinding or real money, Artifact has a much better model. You can get any card in the game whenever you want for less than $0.50 for the most part. There are a few cards like Axe that are >$10 at the time of writing this review, but that price will go down, and he isn't even 100% needed in every deck. In addition, you get $20 worth of packs when you buy the game, as well as tickets to play events with rewards. So you get more than the value of the game in cards/tickets when you buy. Also what others seem to forget is that there is a completely free draft mode that everyone can play. Draft is the most balanced mode because everyone is on the same playing field regarding picks. This game is more expensive than Hearthstone or Gwent if you would never pay for those anyway, but you have to consider how much your time is worth. if you grinded for 10 hours for that card you want in another game, even at minimum wage thats at least $80 you could spend on over half of a complete collection of the first set in Artifact. I think that this game is priced and monetized very fairly, as most good decks will cost less than $10 and you can get them right away. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that like in depth card games.
Launch day review!

The good: Elegant design, high production value, unbelievably fair economy, mechanically deep

The bad: No chat, no progression system, mechanically deep

Knowing Valve, the support for this will be excellent. Can't wait to see where it goes~
this game is good. The complexity makes me feel like I could have played better to win. The game is affordable because I can just buy the cards I need. Also, since I am a bit of a cheapo, I really like the phantom draft feature in casual play. I can draft the cards for practice with friends and have a fun time learning the cards as much as I want.
Fantastic game. A lot of strategic depth with the card and lane interactions, and the passing of initiative. Cards are well balanced and the games I've played so far have all been close. Presentation and sound on the game board is top notch. Several formats available with draft and constructed casual and competitive, and the ability to host tournaments in the client. 

The market is a good implementation. There is the option to play infinite drafts or a constructed event for no more buy in; but for those that want to play competitive constructed and build a collection the market model that Valve has chosen is far better than the popular ccg's around as in Artifact you can actually buy the specific cards you want from the market instead of relying on pack luck - should make it a cheaper model for buying specific decks.
Amazing, innovative, and complex game. I have played Magic, Pokemon, Hearthstone, and many other card games (and also Dota) starting in the 1990s.  Artifact is without a doubt a tier 1 card game staple.  Looking forward to seeing how this plays out over the next few years.
This game really shouldnt be mixed. 
 
 It's a fantastic breath of fresh air into the stale world of digital TCG. I know people don't like the online marketplace and the monetization scheme of this game, but I feel a lot of those people jumped on the wagon before really thinking for themselves. You CAN draft for free, you CAN have tournaments with friends, and you CAN buy singles for a reasonable price compared to other TCGs. Valve will listen and fix issues with the game, we need to be supportive in a positive way instead of a negative one. When new players see the 'mixed' reviews of this game, that will send a note of unsurety and might scare off people who would contribute to that open marketplace. Ive already seen significant price drops for high valued cards, and the game hasnt even been out for 2 days. What I think we should be talking about, is the lack of a rank or mmr. If I want to play draft, and I have a good record, I want to show that. I want people to think 'this guy has a good win/loss record, thats cool' and I want to be proud about that. Maybe have a medal or banner of some kind, something to work towards. 

 Overall I really think this game was crafted with love and passion, and I would hate to see that ruined because of a mob mentallity. This game needs some work, like any other game. But we should be supportive and trust Valve.
tl;dr: 9/10

I don't understand all the complaints about the monetization model. For 17.95€, you get:

[list]
[*] A free draft game mode that can be replayed endlessly (similar to arena in Hearthstone, without entry fee
[*] A free event mode with fun prebuilt decks
[*] A built in tournament mode where you can play tournaments with friends or strangers, including a commons only and a commons+uncommons only constructed mode
[*] 5 entry tickets for expert gauntlets, which should be enough for at least 10ish hours of gameplay if you are not 100% incompetent (and you can practice in the free draft mode, so there's no excuse really)
[*] 10 packs to get your collection started
[/list]

In my opinion, that's a pretty good deal. The game is incredibly fun, and not as braindead as Hearthstone tends to be. I personally like the art and the flavor texts, but to each their own I guess.

Being able to trade card on the marketplace is huge, and it makes the full collection a lot cheaper than in most other games. A full collection is currently around 200€,  but the prices might shift. Building a top tier deck is around 10-50€, depending mostly on the heroes it's based on. I just went 5-0 in a constructed gauntlet using a deck I built for 12€, so in the end, I think Artifact will be a lot cheaper than Hearthstone (to build a top tier Hearthstone deck you have to invest at least 70€, probably more).

The negatives: there's no way to grind cards/packs (probably a good thing as it would wreck the economy, but still annoying), and some features like spectating a friend's game, drafting 1v1, and chat/emotes are still missing, although the devs are supposedly working on the last two complaints.

Overall, I would rate Artifact 9/10, I will update the score when I played it more and know how long-term entertaining it is.
Valve has done it. They created a really solid TCG.  You can easily create competive decks with very little money at all. So Axe cost 16 dollars ...you don't need him and if you do you only need 1.
This game is not for everyone, but for the niche it targets, it absolutely amazing.

The game is a blast to play and very easy to get sucked in.  The starting packs, event tickets, and starter decks are very fair for the price, alongside unlimited modes such as casual phantom draft.

Compared to other TCGs, particularly Magic, this is much cheaper while still having cards retain value when compared to CCGs.  If you want to play constructed rather than draft, you will likely to have to invest more than the initial $20 into the game, which some people are not a fan of.  With modes like pauper (commons only) and being able to get a copy of every common card for less than $10, there are options for players on a budget.

While this game is not for everyone, for players interested in card games (especially those with a background in MTG), could not recommend this game high enough.
It's a modern Hearthstone with Dota wallpaper. It's three basic HS table (monsters with attack/defense, spells and artifacts) at the same time. This allows for some gameplay gimmicks, but does not feel wildly different. The business model is the biggest departure, with some modes (say 3 out of 9) requiring constructed decks with cards costing actual money and no free packs available. There is a ton of stuff you can do without going near these modes and buying every card will set you back about $200. You decide if that seems reasonable. But I suggest playing the base game a few times before investing to see if the appeal lasts.
I have always been really into cards games going back to Pokemon TCG and Yu-Gi-Oh! In 2014 I started playing hearthstone, a game I really enjoyed, however the game started to get stale and to expensive to keep playing. I have high hopes for this game and everything I have played so far has supported this.
Very good TCG with an excellent monetization model. I'm happy to buy cards I want if I want to expand my collection, rather than grind gold for hours in the hopes of randomly opening a card I can use. 

Alternatively, if I do not want to spend money on the game then I can endlessly play Phantom Draft or something similar to my hearts content.

Regardless of your opinion on monetization, the game itself has a lot of depth, is very challening, and also very rewarding. Highly recommended!
Coming from MTG, and having played almost every digital cardgame in existence, my early impressions of Artifact are good.
Gameplay is interesting and engaging, the monetization model is fair in my opinion, and the game looks stellar.

I have some minor gripes about some of the UI elements but that's it really.
Very nice game. The monetisation system isn't flawed - basically every card game requires you to buy additional boosters to be efficient at competitive play, and this one is no different. Due to steam marketplace, it seems like not that big of a problem though. When comparing to other TGC games like hearthstone, Artifact seems like it will be less RNG based, making more use of strategy and understanding of the game then just pure OP cards. Time will tell, but for now, I can see how this game can be a lot of fun, even without further investments.
Easily the best card game on the market right now. Not sure what the whining about the price model is, it is extremely good compared to things like hearthstone. The only thing that beats Artifact in terms of pricing as far as I know is Gwent. You can play casual draft or if you get really good you can expert draft and earn cards for free.
Valve brings it's own card game and I have to say I do like it very much. Expanding the dota universe lore, very deep and complex gameplay, good modes.
I'm no stranger to card games, having played Netrunner, Hearthstone, HEX, Shadowverse, MTGA and now Artifact. Speaking honestly, this is easily one of the best digital CCGs out right now. 

The marketplace is not what people are used to. Since this is B2P, there are no daily quests, in game-currency, or free to play rewards. This unfortunately makes the game feel a bit dull from a certain perspective, but it's insanely fun to play without any of these rewards, and some form of progression is reportedly coming. 

If you're on the fence because of the monitization, keep in mind that there is no dusting of any crafting system: you can just buy the cards you want. While the top tier cards like Axe, at the time of this writing go between $10-$20 CDN, most other cards range from a couple of dollars to mere cents. It's a bit of an ask to buy cards when people are so used to the Hearthstone/MTGA model of grinding for free cards/packs, but it definitely gives you some choice in what kind of deck you play. Anyway, can't wait for the next set and beyond!
I've been playing this game for a good while now, and I can say I'm completely smitten. The game price is better than other online TCG's in terms of of completing a set and the game itself provides a ton of depth while being set in my favorite game universe, DOTA.
The gameplay is super fun, great strategic depth and when I lose it feels like I could have played better and won. Cost is pretty cheap and you dont have to pay for the modes despite waht others are saying. There is free phantom draft you just dont get to keep what you drafted or get rewards, seems fair to me since you didnt pay an entry fee. That and no need to grind for "free" cards at a rate of like $1 value an hour played is great.
Great game so far, though I look forward to seeing where prices hover after about a month.  Tournament-viable decks are $30-$50 if that's your thing, but at this point I'm just running draft and selling rares I get from packs.  If you don't like TGC models that don't let you play casuals for free forever (hearthstone), this game probably isn't for you.

This review, however, is subject to change based on whether or not they add some degree of progression or incentives to play over the next few months.  The only large flaw this game currently has is that the game doesn't track your matches, offer progression, or any sort of reward, tangible or not, for any form of matches played.


The game looks great and gameplay is intuitive and enjoyable. At launch there are a few features and functionalities absent, but they'll come so I'm not going to list them.

There is a good variety of game modes, both FREE and pay to play. The $20 price tag includes 10 packs and two starter decks. 

I absolutely recommend this game. It's a great next step for card games.
Game is difficult to get into much like dota. The games seem to be designed to be close and decided by a 2-1 split which is fine by me but not for everyone.
Much better than I was expecting. 

I see people complaining about the monetization aspect, but I believe that the cards, packs, event tickets, are fairly priced and allow for much more gameplay than some of the other digital cards games on the market. 

Plus, there is a free draft. Sure, you don't get to play with the cards, but free draft whenever you want.
I'm not a card game player, I hated Hearthstone. Luckily I got this game free from going to TI and being a DOTA player it made me want to try it. It's amazing fun so far and really easy to get into but with a lot of depth once you know the basics. Highly recommended to give it a try.
Dota and MTG are 2 of my favorite games of all time, and this is as close as you can get to a hybrid of them. Has the competitiveness and intensity of Dota in a tcg package.
The gameplay is deep and rich with mechanics. It has the complexity of Magic the Gathering without the clunkiness that comes with translating MTG to digital. The Dota 2 flavour is amazing for a familair player. 

I feel the monetization is fair for a TCG. The marketplace and the deck building feature makes it easy to buy only the cards you need. I've been able to buy 80% of the heroes for around 4$ and all the common cards in the set for 5$. With those, I've been able to create some pretty fun and competitive decks. 
You also get to draft without any aditinal cost and the Call for Arms event gives you access to 6 pre-made fun decks with different archetypes to experiment with. 

I agree that a progression system with some rewards would be nice, but I feel the game provides a very compelling experience as it is now. 

5/7 


Great gamer, but you need to go into it expecting to pay money, like a real CCG. It's a pretty deep and complex game, and is a blast to play. If you're not cool with spending money on cards, then stay away, but if you're okay with it, then expect to find a deep and rewarding card game, with interesting mechanics.

As a side note, a complete collection costs around $200-300, which is much cheaper thana other games (Hearthstone for example, costs upwards of $500 for a complete basic set), granted you can sell repeats, and if you get lucky, like I did, you can get some of the more expensive cards (Axe in my case) for free in your first ten packs.
I can’t help but think that people complaining about the monetization model are complete ignorant concerning TCG games. Especially digital ones.

Every single other game forces you to grind for packs to build decks. They have a complete RNG loot box system that you have to throw your money at to be able to be competitive.

Artifact is not like this at all. You get to choose which card you want and buy it.

Axe is 14 bucks right now at launch. Most of the other cards are below 50 cents.

How in the world of TCG could you possibly be upset about how the game is monetized?

Unless you expect all of the cards to be given to you with your 20 dollar purchase? In this case rip for the longevity of the game and future expansions.

I honestly think this is a case of the Reddit/internet hive mind. Same thing happens with every game. As soon as the bozo with the loudest voice complains about something everyone jumps on board to rally with this idiot. I’m not saying these things are never justified because there are plenty of reasons to “rally” but there are just as many misplaced ones as there are justified ones.

The monetization is something that the TCG community has been waiting for for a long time.

On top of all this the most balanced way to play (drafting) is fucking free. Casual phantom draft allows you to use all of the cards in the set for free.

This coupled with tournaments with friends is revolutionary in the realm of online TCG games so before you start rallying along with the crowd that’s against the monetization please get informed because the way valve has chosen to launch this game is a giant step in the right direction for the TCG genre as a whole.

Edit: when you guys have played the game enough to feel good about a review please do so. Negative or positive. Based on a lot of these comments people who are complaining aren’t familiar with the TCG market and don’t see this as a huge step in the right direction as it should be seen.

That being said I do agree that the ticket system for expert play feels bad for a lot of players as you aren’t sure if you’re going to be able to win back your tickets and will thus have to buy more but these modes rotate out on 12/14/2018 and so I am left to believe that the “progression” that they are planning to add will be some sort of ranked ladder that will not rotate and will not cost tickets.

This is my assumption but I would be willing to bet that I am correct about this. If the ranked MMR system doesn’t happen then by all means point and laugh and say I told you so.

Perhaps the progression system will award tickets and packs and give incentive to play more casual modes to participate in these tournament like events.

I do hope that a ranked ladder happens and that it doesn’t cost tickets. I can’t see them adding MMR system to the current expert pool. I think that would be a huge mistake on valves part but I guess we will see.
Highly polished, well balanced, INTERESTING AND FUN card game that is well worth the initial $20 investment.

Beyond that $20, you may be offended at the microtransactions for packs, or for tickets for events. In order to earn new packs for your collection, you are required to spend money unless you are among the best of the best. If you continually win games in paid event game modes, you get your ticket back and can play again for free. Otherwise you will keep spending a few dollars on tickets. Beyond these game modes, there's a FREE draft mode that is functionally the same but with no card rewards. Also there's special timed events for FREE that are a ton of fun and great to understand mechanics of decks and cards.

Fans of Magic will appreciate the depth of this game. Fans of Hearthstone will appreciate the polish. Fans of Gwent will appreciate the mechanics, and looking at all the pretty numbers. Fans of Elder Scrolls: Legends are probably actual robots.

If you ever consider spending money on another card game, consider spending $20 on Artifact instead. You won't be disappointed!
Artifact is a wonderful card game with a steep learning curve for those willing to put in the time. People have been calling artifact "pay2win", however this is a sentiment that I strongly disagree with. The game has a cost of $20, which includes 10 booster packs that sell for $1.99 a piece, and 5 tickets that are $.99 a piece. You are allowed to use preconstructed decks for free, you can construct your own deck with the cards you get and play constructed for free in casual, and you can even draft for free in casual. In expert play you can spend 1 ticket to take a constructed deck in, and if win 3 games without 2 losses you get your ticket back, if you win 4 you get your ticket back and a free pack, and if you win 5 you get the ticket and 2 free packs. Phantom draft is set up the same way with its rewards, and for Keeper draft you need 2 tickets and 5 packs, and regardless of how you do you get to keep all 60 cards that you choose in the draft. The rewards for keeper draft are 2 tickets and 1 pack for 3 wins, 2 tickets and 2 packs for 4, and 2 tickets and 3 packs for 5.

This means that when you buy the game, if you play with the free decks and get comfortable with the game, you can at the very least play 2 keeper drafts and 1 phantom draft for free, with the potential to get enough rewards to do atleast one more run of either.

If you want to play expert constructed and have a decent chance at winning then yes, you do likely need to spend more money on boosters, however this is generally the same situation as magic the gathering, where even if you buy a starter kit you likely will need to buy certain cards that can cost a lot of money in order to play competitively. People also like to complain about how its pay2win because of the marketplace, however magic the gathering has many online stores to buy specific cards, with many cards being much more expensive then even axe, who is currently the most expensive card. Compared to magic the gathering this game is relatively cheap in its entry to competitive play.

Very good card game! A lot of strategy I have yet to learn and surprisingly easy to pick up! Would recommned for anyone who has 20 dollars to spare should buy this since you can play unlimited free construction without paying a single dime more. That alone will make this game worth it for a long time to come.
The game is mechanically sound, and provides you many gamemodes to enjoy. For the casual gamer this game is not for you, but anyone who enjoys dota lore and card games dropping $20 is completely worth it. The only gripe I have is the lack of ways to get packs besides playing expert mode, or literally buying them.
This game redifines what online TCGs. It takes full advantage of the steam market to have a similar economy to physical tcgs. This game is NOT FREE you DO have to pay for everything you wana play. It is expensive to play competitivly but not as much as other reviews make it out to be. For about $200 you would have every card (in the first set) but you can play 1-2 competitive decks for about $60.

enough about the monetization lets talk about gameplay.

Contrarly to other card games this game has been designed with draft in mind.
It brings new innovative game mechanics.
The randomness is intimidating at first but rarely decide the outcome of a game.
The LORE is everywhere if its something that interests you.
Every card has lots of voice acting.
Visual effects look incredible due to the fact that this is a pc game first.

If you are interested in card games but find the monetization apaling. I would suggest you at least try the draft mode that is included with the initial purchase.
So far Im thinking the game is really damn good. Mechanics are solid with some pretty interesting and new stuff that I've never really seen in a Card Game. Main difference is that there are three boards that you and your opponent are competeing against all at once. The other is the hero system in the game. This system requires you to have 5 heroes for each deck, each hero comes with their own 3 special cards along with a special ability (there are some that don't) that they can use without mana. One major thing that makes the game very unique is that heroes will come back after death to join the battle again. You can also modify these heroes with items and cards that will give them special abilities, health, armor, and attack. Heroes also have specific colors that they're assigned to (blue, black, red, green) and if one hero of blue color is in a lane you can play blue cards in that lane, if not then you cannot play any blue cards. This works the same for every color. This is what makes the game super fun for me since there is a lot you can do with this system and makes an interesting new challenge I haven't seen in any other Card Games.

Another cool system in the game is the shop. For your deck you'll have to put 9 shop cards in your deck. These aren't part of the deck you draw but in the shop where you can buy items for gold (which you earn from killing heroes [6 gold] and creeps [1 gold]) from 3 different decks. One deck that gives you a random item, the other gives you cards from your own item deck, and a consumable which can be potions and a town portal scroll. Do not underestimate the shop in this game, it can give you some game winning items and is also essential to make you heroes stronger.

Now for the game's business model you obviously have to spend 20 bucks to buy the game. With this you get 2 starting packs and 10 packs of cards (which I think have 12 cards each). This will start you off with a decent amount of cards to make some decks. So far I've been doing ok with the stuff I got and I didn't get anything particularly strong. Note that these packs are guaranteed to have at least two rare cards in them unlike other digital card games. Also don't think that you can spend 20 bucks and just ride the rest out free. You can technically do it with the 5 event tickets you get from buying the game. However, this game is primarily a TCG (Trading Card Game) not a CCG (Collectable Card Game). Difference is that in a TCG you're going to need to spend money on packs or even cards themselves in order to get what you want. Some of you may love it or hate it. I personally love it since you don't need to rely on packs themselves and just use the marketplace to get what cards you need. I've seen some reviews complaining about this model and is probably the reason why this games reviews are mixed right now. I think this because the game has really nothing wrong with it when it comes to gameplay or graphics. The game has been very excellent and charming with what heroes or creatures will say when you play it next to another card or when you do a really cool thing on the board. The Imps are also really cute and funny with their reactions to when you clear the board or when your tower is about to die (the look they give you makes me feel really bad when I'm about to lose). So I think for the most part it has to come down the buisness model and the amount of time each game takes. I think my average time is about 20-30 minutes but I can't really confirm it. So the games do take a while compared to your average digital card game. However compared to MTG I think its on pare with the amount time it takes for a game. Its not a big deal for me but for you it may be different. If you're iffy on the buisness model thats ok too but remember that this TCG is probably not going to be as expensive as other CCGs since theoretically you can spend hundreds of dollars trying build pro level decks quickly instead of using the slow and inefficient free to play systems they have in those games. So yeah Artifact may be a little Pay to Win but so are some of the other great TCGs such as MTG or Yugioh or even just the most popular CCGs. This is just part of what the genre is about and what makes Artifact unique compared to the average CCG you've seen probably a million of since Hearthstone came out. So I would definetly reccomend this game. If the buisness model bothers you I still think you should give it a go, 20 dollars isn't too much money so giving it a play won't be too bad.
This game is super fun. I don't think it's going to be fun for everyone because it is very complex.
But, having played and loved many card games, I don't think anything offers the slow/methodical play that this game does. If you are frustrated because none of your friends want to play the super complex board game on your shelf, you should try artifact.

Also, in regards to the monetization, I spent $15 on the marketplace and picked up a bunch of heroes to play with, and a full black deck.

If you want to spend a lot of time grinding for cards (I don't think that's a bad thing. It can be a nice sense of progression) then you won't like this. But if you are coming in ready to spend a bit of money so you can play with specific strategies, I think this will ultimately be much cheaper for you. Plus, if you enjoy experimenting with sillier non-meta decks, this is definitely a good game for you, as non meta cards are less than $0.50 on launch day and dropping.
The only people crying about this game are the peasants who have never played a real trading card game and expect everything to be handed to them just by spending enough time and not any money. I do take concern with actual buy in tournaments as I'm not a fan of those and hopefully valve can remedy that. Otherwise everything else about this game is phenomenal and really $2 a pack is nothing but peasants will be peasants
TL;DR: Long time legend Hearthstone player. I love Artifact and will focus on that for now. Having tons of fun doing 100% free drafts. Don't miss out if you are into card games.
It is a very fun game with the option of buying packs of cards, which isn't really a bad thing considering that other games like this also have you buy packs but the good thing in this game is you can sell the cards you dont want or even just trade them.
I really like it so far. Yeah you have to pay for cards, but honestly you do in HearthStone and the other card games. But they pretend like you don't. Here it's an even playing field and they respect your time. You aren't tricked into playing every day to do boring quests and unlock stuff. You play a card game like you would have in the old days of MTG and stuff.

The gameplay is super fun so far too.
Fun and drastically cheaper then all the other online card games if you actually want to build a deck. Somehow they managed to totally capture the feeling of a Dota 2 match in a card game!
Just purchased the game and I am happy to see the ability to buy and sell your own cards. Compared to other digital card games this is the best decision they could have made. I hate grinding for packs, and being able to buy the cards I want when I want them is wonderful. Mechanically the game is very well done too. Complex, but easy to understand.
I have been waiting for this game ever since it was announced. I love Dota 2, and I love Artifact. The way the monetization is done is amazing for casual play. Gameplay is intense and super fun! Looking forward to hundreds of hours not spent playing Dota 2 :)
People are crying for this being pay to play, but man is this game good or what. Beats every other digital card game for me. Card's are dirt cheap except the best ones. you can play free draft if you so want and don't like expert gauntlet with event tickets etc.
This game ain't expensive as decks in mtg or yu-gi-oh.
Little long end with the games, but the amount of choices and options you have is crazy. This is thinkers dream card game.
10/10 for me easily and can't wait for expansions to expand the card pool which is the downside in every card game when they start, it's little small, but still damn good.
Balance is questionable, but I don't mind it so much, it's same in every other game also. In HS there is always meta with like three different deck types that totally dominates it, same applies here, though I can't be sure for this is still so fresh game.
Anyways go buy it if you enjoy deeper card game! Superb work on this!ää
Phenomenal game. I've played all the other card games, primarily HS over the last couple years and this blows it out of the water. You have control over the results, the game is entertaining, production is AAA, and game mechanics are as fun as they addicting. Thank you Valve for this polished gem.

And just for the record, the $20 I spent to purchase the game has been already paid-for by the cards I got in my packs. To anyone bitching about the P2Play model you're absolutely insane, the system here is incredibly generous and gives you 5x the value for your money compared to any F2P game (cough* HS) which is anything but FREE to play at a competitive level.

For $20 you can play phantom draft (best game mode) for free, drafting between all cards. You don't have to pay a penny more should you chose not to.

After pioneering the F2P model for Dota it's impressive Valve found a P2P model that's anything but crippling. Best game I've played in years.
Look I know a lot of people are worried about the $20 dollar entry fee on top of paying for cards, but there is a silver lining to it all. Not only do you get a kick ass card game but you also get 2 pre-made decks (Don't know what the price of them leads up to sorry), 10 packs (Valued at $20), and 5 event tickets (Valued at $5). So not only are you getting 25 dollars for your 20 but you can also sell the duplicate cards you have, or turn them into event tickets. Coming from an era of card games where you had to go to the store to buy packs or buy singles from a card shop there isn't much difference here. There are a lot of people upset at the fact that you can't grind out for cards and packs but the simple fact is that because you can sell the cards that making that an option just isn't business savvy. There is a difference between CCG and TCG and people really need to learn it.

In terms of gameplay, its intense. There is so much strategy and complexity in the cards that you can make a deck about pretty much anything and it still be viable so long as you play it right. And with the combination of colors your imagination can run wild with all the possibilities. There is a bit of a learning curve but once you get over it there are so many little tips and tricks you can pick up along the way that makes this game really shine. With so many different play styles being encouraged in the game mechanics and the cards every Timmy, Johnny and Spike will get something from playing this game. I've wanted a card game I could really sink my teeth into and I finally got it, and the fact it mixes my favorite video game and card game of all time, I really can't complain.

Side note on the lore... There is a ton of it and my god is it good. Because all the card lore is voice acted you can just sit there for hours and listen to the characters tell their sides of the story. If you weren't a fan of Dota before maybe it will catch you eye and have you take a look.

All in all I really wished people would understand that not every game is gonna be free, making games costs money, keeping them running more so. Yes you have to buy packs and event tickets but when you step outside to play Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, or Magic The Gathering you aren't gonna be given free stuff. So in truth this game isn't for those who don't want to put money into it (or grind through gauntlets and earn packs) and that's okay because you can't make everyone happy. But for those of you who want a good card game and want to dive deep into it, You got the right game.
How do I get through one night without you
If I had to live without you
What kinda life would that be
Oh I need you in my arms, need you to hold
You are my world, my heart, my soul
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you?
I want to know
How do I breathe without you?
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live
Without you
There would be no sun in my sky
There would be no love in my life
There'd be no world left for me
And I, baby, I don't know what I would do
I'd be lost if I lost you
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away
Everything real in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live
Please tell me baby how do I go on
If you ever leave
Baby you would take away everything
Need you with me
Baby don't you know that you are
Everything good in my life
And tell me now
How do I live without you
I want to know
How do I breathe without you
If you ever go
How do I ever, ever survive
How do I, how do I, oh how do I live
How do I live without you?
How do I live without you, baby?
How do I live without you?
I like the depth of the game.  Free draft makes the business model much better.  Worth $20.  The production quality is very high. If you like draft modes pick this up for sure
Artifact provides new depth to a genre that seems to be struggleing to take advantage of the online card game scene with more boards, a higher skill ceiling, and classic charaters from dota 2 to boot.
The gameplay is really refreshing and complex, the outplay potential is high and the better player usually always wins. I don't really care about the economy, but I also don't have a problem with it. You can get a full constructed deck for much much MUCH cheaper than in most other card games. And draft mode is literally free. The integrated tournament system is amazing, too.
I have one complain: The game definitely lacks a sense of progression and really needs a progression system. I'd also prefer a visible MMR.
One neutral point: There are not many cards right now, but thats pretty normal for a new card game. Expansions will help out.
As a lifelong card game player of almost every single TCG and LCG on the market I am loving this so far. Love the model. Love the innovative gameplay. Richard Garfield is a god. 

So far things bode  very well for this game and I can't wait to see where it goes.
People bitching about cards costing money in a game?
In what game do you not pay for cards in these games, this way you just can get cards you want cheaper 
than paying for 200€ for random cards by getting them in the market. 

Besides draft mode doesn't require you to have any cards so i don't understand the issue?
Only constructed requires bought cards but who the fuck requires all cards anyway.

So far i've enjoyed my games
Best card game I’ve play so far since MTG
RNG still exist but not gamebreaking like some of the online CCG right now
Buying card feels way better than have to grind countless hours to buy pack to get card we want
Wish to see better future expansions

10/10 for card game lovers
People do not understand. This is not a CCG, this is not intended to be free or cheap. This is a TCG, welcome to the world of TCGs.  Games such as Magic and Pokemon, but there are plenty others to speak of. If you are looking for a new TCG, to sink your hard earned money into then this is for you. Its fun, exciting and full of strategy to take down your opponents. If you are not looking to sink hundreds of dollars into a card game then this is not for you. Guess what you will be ok, that is fine. Please stop rating games poorly because you are ignorant. The monetization is done well, imo.  It breathes a breath of fresh air into playing a TCG, instead of going to the card shop opening packs and then finding random people or friends to trade with. Also yes many hours can be spent for $20 too. Look it may be the cold hard truth, but if you are having trouble coughing up the $20, that is what valve wanted, A: want to make a ton of money, no one is denying and B: they want there to be a price to ride, so that keeps people that wont take it seriously out. Obviously typically the more you spend the more serious you will take playing the game. Essentially betting on each competitive match adds a layer of seriousness and stress, upping the ante when it comes to competitive matches. Also not to mention it serves as a warning that this is not F2P, and essentially not to expect it to be cheap. A TCG where you have to buy even starter pack is going to run you some money. This game does the best that I have found at taking the paper card experience and making it digital. So everyone saying they are practicing seedy micro transaction practices sound daft.  

Look the game does an excellent job at what it sets out to do. That is to be another TCG, and TCGs are expensive. Just look at top Magic Cards, the card alone is $1,000s. If this wasnt what you expected and you were thinking more along the lines of Hearthstone or ESL, that is not the games fault but your own.
im having fun so far. you dont have to keep buying cards to have a chance(you get about 185 cards with the game), i dident and i have a 50% win rate so far. plus you can play the free phantom draft.
I think this game can fit into a specific niche inside the online card genre.  Its not as complex as MtG or as easy to understand as hearthstone. It fits right into the middle ground.  As far as the cost is concerned I think its fair enough, average prices of a full relesase game these days are $60, thats about what I would spend on each hearthstone season a year. From this perspective I can have most of the cards I would need to have fun in this game in constructed. The fact of the matter is for $20 you have access to causal phatom draft which is a free and unlimited mode that gives you access to everything this game has to offer if you can't spend money on packs. Cost is reasonable, but we'll see after how expansions and markets place dynamics are worked out. I'd recommend for the car loving community to at least give this a try, even for the casual player there is definitely $20 worth of value in this game for you. Highly recommend.
Complex and competitive card game with really affordable pricing, great visuals and interesting mechanics. Don't listen to the haters who just want another f2p grindfest and give it a try!
Good game buy it and come lose your dignity. Alternatively you can come slap the hell out of my minions because my decks are bad, either way fite me you won't.
One of the best card games I've ever played. Just like MTG, you have to spend money (or be really good) to be "competitive". That's the keyword. You can play this game endlessly for free though if you want to play casually through the amazing Phantom Draft mode. However, I do wish there was a leveling system to get more tickets and packs or some sort of daily quests.
The dream card game based on my all time favorite game, Dota. 
Excelent gameplay and replay potential. I can see myself sinking a lot of time to this game. 
A lot of hiccups in the start but knowing Valve, they can iron things out soon.
fantastic game, mechanically it provides one of the best card game experiences you will ever have. 

as for the hate towards monitzation ---- listen to this: 

most of the people complaining fail to realize that when games such as hearthstone have f2p options and grind4content, what happens is your dollar when you choose to spend it is worth A LOT less. in this game the consumer actually gets a lot more value out of their dollar, making purchases actually worth it. especially buying individual cards. f2p would basically make the game  better for the masses while making the people actually supporting it bleed by having to spend much much much more money to keep up.
A great game. Irrelevant and insignificant RNG. Completely free-to-play mode after paying the initial price and the cards are dirt cheap. Well-designed and I've been playing Draft for 10 hours straight.
Great game overall.
Seems like people have forgot that games cost money, so many are shocked.
Can easily make a decent deck with close to no money at all.
The first impressions are amaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazing. Great complexity, graphics and modes. Bunch of ways to play for free after buying the game and gigantic potential for future.  Don't listen to the HS fanboys or other brainwashed idiots.
One of the best card games I've played since Magic The Gathering, it has the speed of Hearthstone and the strategy of Dota (without having to constantly herd your teammates). I see a lot of other reviewers complaining about the monetization model but it's actually super friendly: you can build almost any deck you want in the game for a few dollars since you can purchase specific cards you want off of the market (the highest price card during this period of high fluctuation is about $18 but there are very few that even get into the dollar range with many being a nickel or less), you can play unlimited free drafts, you can play the event decks, you can play drafts that cost a dollar and potentially win your dollar back plus packs (though I'd reccomend playing a bunch of drafts first so you can get the hang of it) and you can destroy extra cards you have to get more tickets to play drafts. There are only 3 rarities in the game and you are guranteed a card of the highest quality on opening a pack. A couple of dollars is not worth more than your time unless you do not have any talents or skills, please help support this monetization model if you enjoy this game.
A great card game. So many ways to play and enjoy the game. The market gives you an option to get cards by other means than gambling on packs.

I didn't get to play that much yet, but I love the gameplay. Your good moves feel rewarding : winning feels like a deserved accomplishment. And when you lose, you can clearly understand why, or at least get an idea of where did things went south. You can truly learn from your mistakes.

I can't wait to see how the game develop, and while I cannot play that much (work + family), I look forward to my next games with excitement!
Got into the game because of dota but stayed for the engaging, extremely intense gameplay. My first few hours flew by since I was having so much fun. Controllring a game to victory with nail biting mechanics and timings is what gives this game a unique identity in the card game world. I think there is a lot of truth behind the "cash grab" sentiment since calve would rather make money making competition to hearthstone then retain there employees to create the game people have been asking for forever. Never the less the depth of this game justifies it's production in my book and if you're willing to forgo playing a good game because it might of stopped something like HL3 or Portal 3 in your mind then I don't blame you.
Great game. The gameplay is by far the best card game I've ever played. The pricing and the use of the marketplace actually makes this game quite cheap too.
Don't get discouraged by 20$ price tag, this is the best card game right now. Don't listen to the people who didn't play the game and hate for the sake of hating
Wonderful card game, having a lot of fun with it.  Does require a lot of concentration and brain power to see the lines to victory, as the 3 lanes mechanic does bring a host of new strategies and pathways to winning.  T


*Price*
While TCG nature of this game may put off some to the initial buy in price, but it's actually extremely reasonable.  To put it in perspective, other online TCG's require you to purchase packs that may or may not include the card you want.  If it doesn't have the card you need, you either have to purchase more in hopes of getting a wildcard (MTG:A) or destroy 4 of your legendaries to craft another (Hearthstone).  With this, you just buy the card you need off the market.  If you get extras, you can sell them.

*Gameplay*
Very fun, often times able to make large swings in one turn to come back for a victory.  I wish there was more defining traits to a deck archetype.  To elaborate, the deck identity (Control, Midrange, Aggro, Token, etc.) isn't very clear here and the decks play very similar to each other.  

There's a LOT of RNG here.  I don't think it's as bad as let's say hearthstone, but it's certaintly fustrating.  A good example is Cheat Death.  For 5 mana, all your units this turn on a lane have a 50% chance of surviving all damage and living with 1 hp.  This is a HUGE swing if they all survive, and a HUGE detriment if they all die.  Either way, it doesn't feel that great to either player.

While this game isn't perfect, there certainly is a lot to love. I'd give it a 3.5/5  (2.5 being an average game).

Definitely fun and worth a shot.
Took me a while to get used of the mechanics, but now I'm having a blast playing it. The game is very fun to play and every match has a different ending. Different from other card games, RNG doesnt feel as bad. Regarding the cost of the game, 20$ is reasonable, you het 2 basic decks, 5 tickets 10 packs, which in total cost 25$. 10/10 would recommend.
Great game to play. Despite concerns about pay to win, it handles itself well enough that you can enjoy it casually.If you do want to play competitivly there is an expert mode which uses tickets as you play for rewards which include a ticket and packs depending on the gamemode.
Game is amazing.  If you like card games you'll love it.  Contrary to other reviews, it's not expensive to get into and you can draft for free if you like.
Fairly steep initial learning curve but a really fun and rewarding game. Especially recommended for fans of competitive strategic board games and card games.
Well designed, mechanics have the structure to beat out MTG once there's a few more sets, keywords, and other things to flesh it out. Second hand market makes it better to play if you're 'serious' about card games. Valve crushes it again.
Disclaimer: I haven't put any money into this game, because I don't typically play card games.

Artifact is exactly what it says on the tin - It is a Dota2 card game. It's not like playing Hearthstone or MTG but reskinned to be Dota-like - It's really its own take on the Dota2 mechanics in card form. And it's very nice. Graphical style is appealing, gameplay so far feels like it has a reasonably decent amount of depth whilst being very approachable and simple to get to grips with on the surface.

Even though I haven't put any money into the game, I figured I'd offer my take on the monetisation that has been causing such a fuss - This is exactly the kind of payment model you'd get from a physical TCG. It's not what you're used to if you wanted Hearthstone Dota. Don't buy the game if you want Hearthstone Dota. This TCG has a real card economy, which may or may not be to your tastes depending on how you want to play your games and whether or not you really enjoy hats on TF2.

If you just wanted to play for free, I can't recommend buying the game. But if you would have gotten into MTG or such despite the constant cost of investment, then Artifact is a neat little game that I would definitely recommend.
TLDR:Great card game with very refreshing game mechanics. Hope they slow down the initial card intake and give a way to get decks over time of playing. 

Artifact. The Dota 2 card game we have been waiting 2 years for it’s out. 

To give this game a proper review we will have to see how valve handles the next 3 months covering what people are upset about. 

On to the game play. This is the most innovative card game around with not only one gameplay mechanic being changed but almost every way you play being different from other card games. From the deck building being based around your 5 main heroes and the fact that you must plan your lanes in order to play cards is a refreshing change. The shop mixing up the gameplay past the fact of drawing cards is a good change of pace. And the win conditions compliment diversity in your play-style. 

I can’t speak for watching the game being played but I’m hoping valves past titles(Dota 2 & CSGO) have taught them how to present a game in a esports manner. This will help the competitor nature and growth of strategies to the scene. 

As for people complaining about the monetization of the game. I agree some type of passive way to gain cards over time would be nice. Right now the only way I have seen to get new cards is to play & WIN at least 3-5 ticket(you are limited with these) matches. This just seems a bit too hard for your casual gamers and is slightly off putting. 
On the other hand having all 300 plus cards at the start of the game would be insanity overwhelming. To be honest the starting 100 cards you get are just too much. I have only opened 5 decks and promised my self that I would only open another deck after I win a match. I think a slower as well as steadier way of gaining cards would be better for newcomers and also in courage people to keep playing. Even if it’s 3 decks a week that would add up over time.
While one might dismiss this game because it costs 20$ upfront to purchase it, dont let that hold you back if your in to card games. This game is fantastic and a must play for anyone who really enjoys the card game genre. As for value, in hearth stone if you wanted a deck you HAD to buy packs of cards and hope what you need is inside their. In artifact all you gotta do is go to the market place and buy what you want. Which is almost always going to be cheaper than cracking open packs. If you lean more towards the casual side of things, they offer a free version of their draft mode (Arena mode for heathstone players). That you can play as much as you like. While in other games like magic & hearthstone drafting ALWAYS cost something. So their is nowhere to practice unless you got cash to spend or time to burn and earn gold.
Not being Free to play and marketplace for cards is good much cheaper to play then the likes of hearthstone purchase the cards you want no chance involved
Played the game for a bit today. I think it is a great card game! 

Pros:

-Great graphics (for a card game).
-Core gameplay is fun, interesting and difficult. 
-A decent amount of are modes available.
-Steam market. You can get the exact cards you want/need.

Cons:

-When you buy the game you can not endlessly play all modes and you do not have all the cards. The modes where you can earn cards (through packs) cost "tickets"to play. Winning 3 games earns you back your ticket, 4 wins earn you your ticket and 1 pack, and finally 5 wins will give you a ticket and 2 packs. If you lose twice, you 're out. This makes expanding your deck hard especially when you find it difficult to play the game in the beginning.  

-Steam market. You can only buy cards with real money. 

-If you want to play competitively, for example with a premade deck, dont expect to pay the 18 euros. You most likely will need another 20, at the moment of writing this, to craft a playable deck. 

Tip: If you are out of ticekts and want to get some cheap tickets, just buy some carppy 0,01 cents cards from the market. 20 cards will give you a ticket.
Bear in mind this game is new and I've only played for 12 hours at the time of posting this: 

tl;dr: game is excellent, but you'll probably spend a few extra bucks on it depending on how good you are, and which format you like to play. You CAN play this game without paying more than the $20 and still have a great time.

If you're interested in serious constructed formats, this game will cost you an arm and a leg. However, I find the limited format, draft, the most fun and least expensive. There are also free modes, but these don't yield any rewards (yet). With that out of the way: this game is excellent and a ton of fun. Artifact is intensely complex and has a huge amount of depth to it even with the small card pool. It is also possible to "go infinite", which means to play the "paid" modes indefinitely, without actually paying (if you're really good!)

Also: I paid $20 for the game, played a couple Keeper drafts, sold the good rares, walked away with $27 and two extra packs. Bad news: I'll probably end up spending that on Keeper drafts and tickets.

Update: 40 hours played and I'm still really enjoying the game. I'm currently sitting at about $60 in my account after winning packs and using them to play Keeper drafts and then selling the cards. This is basically a sub-minimum wage job at this point.
Artifact: surprisingly good value for $20. Unless you want to play Axe right now, constructed is super cheap. The economy is easily the best of MTGO and Hearthstone. Phantom drafts give you at minimum an hour of entertainment for a dollar if you lose twice fast.

Highly recommend
Polished, fun, endlessly deep and engaging. 
Also the amount of card interactions, voicelines, and attention to detail is damn staggering.

Note: This is NOT a F2P game. Most of the reviews here seem to be by people who still do not get that. This is a TCG, not a F2P CCG like Hearthstone.

I bought the game for £16. Opened few good rares in my packs, and got £28 in value. Bough every common/uncommon in the game for £10-15 (That's nearly 200 cards, 2/3 of the base set), and then bought some rares for a deck that I want with my own money cos the game is fun.

10/10, would Bolt of Damocles multi-cast again.
Actually a very well-designed card game, I reccomend giving it a try. The monetization model is in many ways much more forgiving than other ccgs out there. Even if it isn't what many people wanted from valve, it is still a very solid game.
giving a negative vote justs because valve made a cardgame and not your beloved half life 3 is a joke...

also for the people saying its pay2win, you could use that logic for every trading card game like magic,yugioh,hearthstone etc
investing more money gives more cards and more ways of playing (obviously). 

the other end of downvotes are hearthstone players that cant use more than 2 braincells for playing a cardgame

overall a good tgc by far not perfect but atleast they try a new way and dont just make another hearthstone clone like 99% of companys
Here's the thing, too many people here are spoiled by the 'FREE2PLAY' model that is out nowadays such as Duel Links, Hearthstone, etc. People have to understand that they are aiming for that nostalgic feel that real life card games provide. In real life the only progression there was Hobby League tournaments or finally beating that one person you struggled with.
I come from playing Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, a bit of Magic, and some other card games in real life. Valve provides the same concepts as those things. You buy packs, or you can buy a single card if you don't wanna spend X amount of money on packs until you finally get that one card you want. You can sell cards too or trade em in for an event ticket! 
Honestly the people that are complaining don't come from card game backgrounds. And I love the fact that in a few new expansions from now, you can not play the game and come back and all you gotta do is of course adjust the playstyle accordiing to the new meta and buy single cards to be up to date. I personally hated the F2P models that other card games provide. Buying packs just to get that 1 card I really need. And sometimes its not even a rare card I needed, sometimes it was a common card but had to open up X amount of packs when I wish I could've just bought that one card.
Anyways I highly recommend this game, the mechanics of it is amazing! Its alot of in depth and strategy.
Picked it up on launch, didn't know how long it would take me to get used to it but it really only takes 2 or 3 games to get into the rhythm, of it. Nearly all my games have been really close, which is exciting and fun. I've only bought 5 extra packs and I'm not having too much trouble in constructed matchmaking.

The draft modes are played with temporary cards so there's less chance of getting stomped by a P2W deck. Those gauntlets are hard but fun to see how far your draft can take you.

If you want to only pay the initial cost and nothing else, this game lets you do that ad still have fun.
Very good game. Complex but intuitive, fun, matches takes long time, requires you to have skill, you can play casually forever without spending extra money into the game, the cards you open in packs can be sold in the market if you like as well as traded.
The gameplay is fun to a point that I have been playing this game nonstop since I started it, and haven't stopped at all until now, in which case I am doing so only to write this review!
If you're a fan of RPG-ish board games, or non-mobile card games like MTG, you'll love this game!
DO YOU GUYS NOT HAVE PHONES?
Artifact's model is very similar to physical card games where you need to buy into it to be and remain competitive (for constructed). If you enjoy this structure and enjoy the mechanics of the game, you will certainly enjoy artifact as it gives you the ability to play competitively (how you would by going to locals) right from home. The market is still settling, but from what can be seen so far, the prices aren't very prohibitive.

That being said, there are plenty of outlets to play casually without investing large sums of money. Community and user organized tournaments, featured events, and casual constructed/draft gauntlets are all available upon purchase. Prize events, like local physical card game tournaments, have a buy-in.
I have to disagree with all critics of the monetarization model. Of all the crooked monetarization models for TCGs, this is by far the (1.) most honest and (2.) cheapest. Also free Phantom Draft that costs absolutely nothing and is a completely proper gamemode. This draft mode is way better than e.g. Hearthstone's or Gwent's Arena mode and costs absolutely nothing to play and you do not need any own cards!
Actual F2P games will trick you into spending way more money than this game ever will.
I am a veteran Hearthstone and Gwent Beta player so I know what I am talking about.

Towards the actual game itself: It might be too soon to have a final opinion on this, but I have been playing about 3 hours and it's A TON OF FUN. I imagine playing lots more! Feels like it is just the right amount of complexitity and RNG.

The graphics and sound is beautiful too. Voiceacting is spot on. So much to learn now!
Its fun to play as a $20 game with free Draft modes. The card enconomy makes pay to win for Constructed mode, but compared to MTG looks cheaper and compared to Heartstone there no grinding or in game currency needed.
its fun, challenging, and straight-up exciting. I've never played TCG's before, but knowing Dota 2 really helped.

edit: I wish it weren't so memory intensive... its a Trading Card Game

edit 2/8/19: as concurrent players continue to drop, only the super-tryhards are playing now...
           and most of the time its frustrating more than fun...though occasionally you find a fun 
           match
Super solid so far. Best part is that no 13 year olds add me after the match and talk about my mom like in Hearthstone. Thank you Valve for finally making a card game that costs money
Do not let the people crying "terrible monetization" put you off of a great game. There are plenty of ways to play without paying more than you have to. If you like deep card games then look this up.
Excellent game.
I don't understand why people cry in one game that you can play every mode for free in Casual. Cards are cheap and you can even sell them if you stop playing.
 First off I just wanted to thank Valve on a great game and an almost flawless release. Bethesda could take a lesson from you guys. Secondly its so nice to make the jump to this from Hearthstone a game of pure randomness where the skilled player increasingly does not win.
First Impression: The game itself is fun so far.
Economy: Well, it's a TCG with a TCG marketing model. What did you guys expect? Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic and Pokemon all similiar pricing models.
Bought on release, not disappointed at all. Cards are cheap on the market, easy to learn after a while and overall challengingly fun experience. First online card game & not disappointed.
Waaaay more depth in each match than other CCGs, like 50 choices made instead of 5. Very cool and distinct strategies, synergies/combos aren't forced but just natural properties, the same deck can have very different games. The balance is kinda shit (maybe 20% of cards are unplayable in all modes) but the gameplay is just better.

As for pricing: $7 for all commons, $25 for all uncommons, $150 for all rares.
An amazing game, but be aware that if you are a competitive person, then you will need to spare some cash at the beginning, not a problem if you know how to play the steam market..
Great game, very intense and stressful compared to other card games, though if you're into that, it's a good thing. There's a lot of thinking to be done about every action and one mistake might just cost you the game. "15 seconds remaining" has never been that hard to hear before. 
It feels like your actions and strategy matter, anticipating your opponent's actions feels rewarding.

The monetization actually feels very generous despite the negative reviews, you can just draft all day long if you win a bit, then open packs and recycle the bad cards to draft more
No, Artifact is not a F2P game and no, Artifact is not HL3.
No, you can't grind cards by doing daily quests.
If you prefers paying with your lifetime instead of a few $, maybe this game is not for you, but it's not my case.
I prefer a game that keep me interested because it is deep and enjoyable, instead of a shallow game that "force" you to come back with shitty rewards.
From my time with the game so far, I can safely say that Artifact is a very, very solid game. Like Dota, its the type of game that will kick your ass and have you begging for more; the game can be very difficult, and when you start you will make tons of mistakes on both a tactical and strategic level that will drive you nutty. Unless there is a very clear gap in skill between players, its not the type of game that you can mindlessly phone it and expect good results regardless. Once you  realize how to fix the mistakes that you make, their is a real feeling that you are actually getting better at the game, and that feeling is what will keep you coming back for more.

The monetization model, while controversial (quite a few of the negative reviews state up front that the game is great, but that they don't like paying for things), is in my analysis fair. For your twenty dollar buy in, you get roughly 25 dollars worth of free-bes (ten packs valued at $2 each plus five event tickets valued at $1 each), plus two starter decks of moderate power. All methods of gaining new cards to permanently own cost money, so players who want to dive into competitive constructed gameplay will need to be willing to invest some additional cash. However, the steam market integration helps tremendously with this, as players will be able to simply buy the cards they want use instead of grinding through packs or taking their chances with events. As of this writing, most cards on the market are available for less than half a dollar each, with the more powerful cards costing one to four dollars each (the most expensive is Axe, at $14 for a playset). If you only want to draft, you can do so for free.

RNG usually isn't a huge deal, with one or two notable exceptions. Most RNG informs your decision making and provides a limited degree of challenge; the most notable examples of this are card draw and how unit attack targets are determined. The only time I've had RNG consistently irritate me by consistently nullifying the effects of my decisions is when I play against a deck that runs "cheating death," which can prevent units in a lane from dying.

If you like card games, this is definitely one to try. I have had fun so far, and if you like to try and defeat your opponents by using mind games and outthinking them, chances are you will too.
I like the gameplay portion of this game a lot but hate the business model.Its best in card game genre in gameplay aspect and one of the worst in business model
The cost of the game gets you free game modes with access to all cards in the game. You can play the game without ever spending another cent, and play with every card in the game. If you want to spend money to own cards to build your own decks (beyond the ~100+ cards you get for your game purchase) you either buy packs like HS/MTG or buy the cards themselves like MTG, the cost of the cards on the market place seem good with low cost to buy the majority of the cards. 

Yes there's additional fees because it's a TCG, not sure why that seems to offend so many, when it's basically how the vast majority of TCG are.

If you like TCGs, this one is really great, and the fees reflect the genre and are what you'd expect.
Deep, satisfying gameplay; challenging to study, build decks and play in the moment. Game pace is not too fast but feels relentless. So far feels like rng  forces me to remain flexible but still allows me to focus on maximiinge strengths and minimizing weaknesses of my decks. I love it.
As someone who has always been interested in online card games I can safely say Valve has added the most interesting addition to the pool. Though it needs a bit more in the content (visable MMR, more insentive to play) in my personal opinion I know valve will surely fix that problem soon. 
would reccomend as something to play when DOTA makes you too salty. 

A deeply clever card game that orchestrates chaos and harmony as deftly as its action-packed counterpart. At times you will feel lost, and at others you will feel that you have expertly needled the achilles' heel of your enemy. Matches are long and thoughtful, and the reward is an intellectual satisfaction I haven't found in many other games. Every card's flavor text has full voiceover, and the game does much to flesh out the lore of the world of Dota.

Yes, you are asked to open your wallet to purchase packs or compete for a chance at earning more cards. If that is not for you, feel free to pass on what is otherwise an incredible game.
So,  a couple of things. 

Artifact is really, really good. The game playing out across three lanes ensures that you always have interesting decisions to make, and that a complete game with one person being the attacker and the other scrambling to defend is kind of hard to have happen. Even a losing game still makes me feel like I had a good chance to win, I haven't come across a game that felt hopeless from the beginning. The card interactions are great, the level of strategy involved feels like it's a bit higher than competing games. 

A lot of people are really upset about how the pricing model works. And after having a bunch of games on the market with a number of grindy ways to acquire free cards, I can see why that happened. But for those of us who cut our teeth on these kinds of games with M:TG and other paper games, Artifact feels quite generous.

What's most generous, is the ability to play what I feel is the most fun mode for the game, draft, for free after purchase. Sure, you don't get rewards, and you don't get to keep the cards, but you get to play a great game in its arguably best mode. Literally no other card game on the market does this, and if you want to simulate it in other games you'd have to use some questionably-legal third party recreation software. 

When I play card games like this, I tend to only play limited modes. I play Magic as a cube draft with friends. The only times I really got into Hearthstone was doing Arena runs. So for me, Artifact is a great choice.

If you want to play constructed, be prepared to throw some money at the game, but not as much as you would to get a competitive deck in Hearthstone or MTG Arena. Espcially nowhere near as much as paper Magic. If you want to play draft, in the gauntlet or in tournaments, and just have a great time with a complex card game, this is my favorite, and I'll be playing a lot of that.
Quick Disclaimer: I have never played a virtual card game before, nor am I skilled in anyway at this game (im pretty bad). 

I was not aware of the hype around the new Valve game earlier this year, and the disappointment that followed for many... so I am a bit indifferent to that whole ordeal. I've also only played a few matches, so i'm no master yet. This is just my personal opinion on the game from a someone who's new to the whole genre.

This game feels great, it looks beautiful, it runs smoothly. Every one of my matches has felt like this magical game that I was expecting when I bought Artifact. The art is amazing, and the mechanics are great. I haven't really experienced the potential for any OP builds yet, and overall the game does require quite a bit of skill and strategy. This game covers most playstyles I can imagine with it's recommended decks, and also allows for custom decks.

I also haven't run into any bugs yet, which is a major plus for a new release, even if it had a beta. From what i've seen so far, most of the negative reviews are based on the card trading behind it. Personally, the amount of cards you start off with is more than enough for me. However, the difference in the amount of cards they gave at the beginning compared to the amount you can buy is... a bit too much. I understand that they want people to go through and earn more cards or trade later to increase the overall "replay-ability"... but it does seem like a steep difference, but like I said, i'm fine with the amount of cards you start with.

When I think of a card game, both physical and virtual, a expect there to be many different packs that you have to purchase individually. To play the game, you need to purchase a pack or two yourself... which you could say is included in the game's price. With these starting decks you can play the game how you want, and if you want more later... get more later. The card's aren't all that expensive, unless you want to buy all of them at once. However, if you buy all of them at once, I feel like that removed a decent part of the gameplay, struggles, and personal progression.

If your wondering if the game is broken or boring, it's working fine for me and tons of fun. If your wondering if the game limits you to the point where you can't really play unless you purchase more content... it definitely does not. There is enough to have fun with at the beginning, and a lot you can expand upon later.

Also, the little imps Lux and Nox add just the right touch to the game. They are adorable.
Overall extremely enjoyable. If you love draft formats this one gives you an infinite draft format in the form of casual phantom draft. Physical TCG monetization in an online card game means you should weigh that cost first and foremost before spending the initial $20. Market prices seem to be mostly reasonable with the exception of Drow Ranger and Axe but their prices should stabilize and decrease as well over the coming month. The ladder, (non casual where you can earn rewards) phantom draft, and keeper draft all require event tickets. You shouldn't have too many issues getting enough tickets to milk as much out of the system as possible if you know what you're doing. 
Gameplay wise it's about all I hoped for and more, but again understand that just like any card game you'll have to spend money to get what you want in any reasonable amount of time. Overall the amount of money you would spend on almost any other digital card game would cost more than just buying the cards you want on this market, but you won't have the option to grind outside of using tickets. Overall though the draft format seems to be more popular than constructed, so you should have no problem finding matches in draft mode if that's all you care about.
Great card game Valve, running like a champion under Ubuntu with my potato laptop. Visuals are great, the music is fantastic, gameplay is flaweless. Lot of content avaliable to play after purchase of the game. But no game is perfect at the start, i'm sure that Valve is going to add the missing futures in near future like trading with friends, some sort of accomplishments, etc. But still i highly recommend this game!!!
Artifact changes up the digital card game scene by focusing on draft over constructed play. Finally there's a card game on the market where your collection of cards (acquired through purchases or grinding) isn't the defining feature of the game. Are you tired of running up against the exact same "top-tier" and meta decks as you struggle through your monthly ladder? Have druids or rogues or whatever is popular been the bane of your existence? Artifact has free and unlimited phantom draft play, so the chance of you running into the same deck twice is near-zero!

Regarding the model for purchasing packs, I don't plan on playing constructed or keeper draft, so it doesn't impact me. Unlimited, free phantom draft is an awesome feature that will provide tons of playtime for me.
The first card game I've ever played and every game has been a ton of fun. This game might give you a headache but it's fantastic. Everything about this game is stunning, I would highly recommend!
Really enjoying this card game, it iwas refreshingly different from some of the other CCG's digital and non digital. While the monetization system is annoying it isn't much worse then any physical card game. Would still recommend it if you enjoy CCGs
Great game, yes you pay upfront but the base game (with the current no pay stuff you can play) will keep you busy for multiple hours if you like card games (Hearthstone/magic..)
Lots of nice ways to play the game regardless of the money you put into it. Don't get dragged into some mob angrily yelling about how this game doesn't allow you to get cards for free, despite this being known information for quite a while. This game isn't hearthstone and if you want something like hearthstone, go play that game.
Really enjoy the game, one of the few online card games that natively runs on Linux and allows support for trading. There's been some criticism of the monetization scheme, but only time will tell how ugly it gets. I'm still hopeful valves will push for accessible cards even for competitive play.

-
Business model/ monitization model (cash grabber for competitive ones
though Gabe Newell explained this in the media presentation why Valve chose this kind of model)

You gotta pay to get every thing you don't have.




P.S. : I want this game to grow and to be successful but I think they need to convert it into Free to play game OR at least CHEAPER. It would be suffice to give the early buyers compensation would be enough just to save the game, in my opinion.
Excellent game mechanics. I don't understand complaints about the monetization system, you can play draft for free, and while the most expensive constructed deck might cost some money, most cards are very cheap on the market.

You only need to pay to play if you want to play the prize awarding modes.
probably the best card game in the market right now
you can get card that you want instead of grinding for it for hours

the gameplay is fun and challanging
RNG is there but it is not a game breaking like heartstone does....


Definetely the best card game(CCG/TCG) on the market by far. This is coming from someone who played HS for 4+ years and have reached legend multiple times. Rahstakhan's Rumble is a major disappiontment. I, for one, welcomes our Artifact overlord.
Easily one of the best games I've ever played. The ruleset and polish are extremely good. If you're even remotely a fan of card games, give it a shot.
The best card game currently. Best game design. Best visuals. Best music. If u only play draft mode like me, there is also no need to spend any more money.
Fun and nice game ! Recommended for sure . I have played hearthstone but this game is way better with 3 lanes to play from and there are many casual modes which are free to play!! love this game .
The good: this game has the most beautifull and complex gameplay I have ever seen in a collectible card game. In hearthstone or MtG games are often simple enough that almost all decisions can made automatically, and playing feels just like going though motions. If you lose a game, you can usually correctly attribute the loss to the RNG or deck building choices. Here it is the exact opposite: gameplay is engaging and challenging, I am rarely sure about the right play and every time I lose the game, I left with the feeling that the game was winnable if only I played better. This alone compensates for all the downsides in my mind, but others may feel differently.

The bad: the high complexity and monetary cliff to participate are going to be a huge turnoff for the people new to the genre. Thus I am worried that this could easily become a game that hardcore gamers and pros love, but never captures a wider audience.

The ugly: The game appears to be poorly optimized, barely running on the strongest 2018 macbook pro, and randomly crashing. There are also server issues with lag and disconnects. Graphics also have some room for improvement. Overall the game feels like it lacks polish and was released too early.
Amazing charm and aesthetic with gameplay mechanics that are verry strategic and rewarding, not to mention the animations and art bring a smile to my face.  The microtransaction system is flawed but manageable, it's true that right now there is no ingame money progression or ranking system which not having the latter is dissapointing to say the least.  Still the fact that you can sell your cards means that having an in-game currency would negatively impact the whole buy/sell trade system.  You can make a good deck with very little money and once you have the cards you need you can always sell them.  I've had tons of fun playing it thus far in spite of the lack of ladder and progression.  Hoping they add that later.
Great depth. Graphics need a bit more optimizing for crappy laptops, and hand control is tough with lots of cards in hand, but the game itself is amazing.
Very enjoyable, much cheaper than physical card games but more expensive than most digital card games. Phantom Draft is my favorite game mode so ultimately the intial 20 dollars got me everything I wanted forever.
An excelent game in itself. I'm not bothered by the way the game is monetized because I like supporting games that are fun. I will definitely continue to support it in the future.
I am having a blast of a time playing artifact.
For anyone that played dota, it is easier to understand the basics because most concepts are similar to those we find at dota. But mastering this game will demand a lot of "trading card game skills". 
If you are not willing to go competitive, just stick to the free sections and have some fun. But if you want to get to the top and be one of the best, be ready to face some fierce competition in this game! Highest recommendation possible!!!

EDIT: oh... and I forgot to mention: I miss some Valve achievements and those cards to craft emoticons, backgrounds and upgrade our steam profile... :(
A little background for context. I play a fair amount of physical TCGs. I've also played a couple of digital but have only put money into digital TCGs with marketplaces for singles (Hex, MTGO)

The Game Itself:
I think the game play is amazing if you like complex board games or TCGs. The client is well made the game play is smooth. That being said if you don't like complex board games or TCGs it may not be the game for you. It's too early to really talk about meta health or game balance i think. 


Monetization:

I have not put money into this game beyond the entry fee so far. I think the cost to buy the game is fair for what it gives you. I was hesitant before the free phantom drafts. Now after playing I think the 26$CDN is probably worth unlimited phantom drafts alone, let alone the fact that they give you a bit more than cost value in packs and tickets.
The price to pay competitive looks like it will be cheaper than physical MTG. My only hesitation with investing money into the singles market is that there doesn't seem to be a good  means of 'cashing out'
With hex because there was a market + trading you could sell your collection for real money outside the game if you wanted to leave. On here i could fill my steam wallet via the market and buy video games which is ok.... but if this game lasts a long time and has similar value to MTG there is the chance of eventually having thousands of dollars in cards and if I ever stopped playing i might want real money over steam credit.




I'll never regret joining something that can cause so much asshurt without even trying. It's like being delivered a fresh bottle of tears every Monday.

remember to buy singles through market instead of gambling for them in packs
I have had a really fun time so far and would recomend anyone who likes Dota or card games to pick this up.

A few gripes I have however:

There is no progression and because of this it can sometimes feel like playing casual modes are pointless.
Some of the more expensive cards are the most powerfull and required for some constructed decks. I was really looking forward to playing a blue deck but currently I would need to drop $40 on cards to finish the deck.

Despite these problems the gameplay is very deep and intense and it seems as though valve is going to update the game regularly with based off of feed back and new expansions to keep the game fresh.

Would recommend
Great game with great gameplay. People are disingenuously reviewing this game alongside hearthstone and games similar. It is NOT free to play. It delivers an experience completely separate from Hearthstone. And I argue that its cheaper to play competitively here than hearthstone (with the randomness). Want a card? Buy it. The economy seems predatory and honestly? If it was free to play with this economy it would be, but the $20 price tag lets you know this isn't free and isnt going to be free. Also, if you don't like constructed with its "p2w" format just play draft! There is a casual draft format that doesn't require event tickets and can be played infinitely. Great game. Worth your $20.
People complaining about the "cost" don't get it. Being able to purchase single cards on the marketplace for pennies makes this game WAY cheaper than other card games, WAY cheaper. Game is alot of fun, albiet matches do run pretty long. More features are supposed to release after launch. When that occurs my rating of this game will go up. For now SOLID: 8/10.
I’ve played SV, Harth...Pokémon. Nothing compares. Everything going on with this game is absolutely out standing. I had a savage pack ready to melt this dude tower and he goes and uses the Helmut of persuasion. I’m thinking aw sheet but then on second draw I was able to drop chad daddy mid land, take my creep back and straight melt. Green Blue decks a best.
Really fun game in the vein of MtG. Color based decks, with matches usually coming down to the wire on both sides. The game provides a free draft mode with every card available, and also provides pre-made decks to try online to see what style of play you prefer before constructing your own. 

The mass of negative reviews is mainly from the idea that players have to pay for cards. I'd argue that this system is acceptable due to the cheap price of the cards (.05-.10 cents for most, with rarer cards dropping in price by the minute), as well as the ability to win cards in the competitive draft mode.

Ultimately, the game is a lot of fun and I'm excited for the future. If Valve gives this game the same treatment they gave Dota 2, it's in for a good time. Absolutely recommend.
The game is a magnificent reincarnation of MtG in a proper digital form. Totally recpmended to all CCG fans (Specially old school paper MtG fans). Thanks, Garfield & Valve!
Artifact is a complex, fun card game that never repeats the same game twice. It's three lane system and creep spawning mechanics make every game feel different from the last, even if you're using the same deck. The review bombs for the game are not indicative of either the quality of the game itself or how many people are playing it.

The most important point to address is the payment model. Most people misunderstand it to an incredible degree. You can play the game forever, without a spending another dollar, after the initial $20 purchase. You can do as many free phantom drafts as you want (normal drafts, you just don't keep the cards), or if you're into constructed, you can do either the Call to Arms Gauntlet, where everyone is on an equal playing field using pre constructed decks, or just general constructed matchmaking. 

As far as constructed goes, if you want to be seriously competetive at it, you will have to spend *something*. That is not a concept that is new to Artifact, that is just how card games work. People point to Hearthstone as an example of a F2P card game, but to play that seriously and competetively, you either need to put in money or work at it like a second job. Artifact does not lie to its players; it knows its competetive edge is not free and it never trys to tell you that. 

Overall, the negative reviews of this game are almost entirely either angry Half Life fans, or people who don't understand how card games work. Artifact is Complex, fun, and doesn't take any more of your money than you want it to. You could have unlimited fun with this game by doing the free phantom drafts alone. If you're in the market for a new card game, this is absolutely worth a shot.
I bought this game the day of release and I'm a pretty picky gamer.   I really like it.   I'm not sure what bees crawled into some people's bunghole over it, but it's a very well done card game.   Thank you and congratulations to the developers!
The game is really enjoyable regardless of the microtransaction issues. It can be played with the given cards from the beginning, and as a casual player that is mroe than enough.
This game is fundamentally awesome. It can be a bit expensive, but for $20 you can forever do the things that you can in Hearthstone and the like (without the grind). I am pretty sure constructed is still probably cheaper than other games anyway.
i really like this game. And the most exciting part is the RNG is not the factor that decides every game but rather the decision that was done by the player himself.
For the record, I played in the beta - I have been playing the game for a whole week to come to my conclusions.

Artifact is of the of the best TCGs I have ever played as far as depth and complexity go. There is a lot to keep track of, but after playing a bit, it becomes easier to understand. 

That said, the monetization model isn't for everybody. If you're familiar with other TCGs, the pricing model will likely seem much cheaper or more fair. To anyone else, just expect to spend to spend extra money if you want to play constructed. Prices are fluctuating a ton with the launch, but things will get cheaper over time. If you don't care about constructed, you can play draft as much as you want, for free, through the casual phantom draft gauntlet.

Each color or house feels unique in how they play, and I imagine they’ll feel more unique as more expansions are added. Games feel slower right now, with new players reading everything, but from my experience, most games only last around 10-25 minutes. 

I have only had one game where I feel like I lost to RNG. Every other loss can essentially be put down to me not playing as well, or noticing a misplay I made earlier in the game. As such, much like Dota 2, it feels like Valve is going to do whatever they can to help ensure the game is going to be a successful esport.

With that said, here are a few small nit-picks.
[list]
[*][strike]There is no colorblind mode. I’m not colorblind, but others have spoken out on how difficult it can be to tell rarity symbols or card colors apart.[/strike] Taken care of!
[*]There is no 1v1 draft with friends. If you want to draft with friends, you need at least 4 people. If this changes, I’ll try to remember to come back to this review and change it.
[*][strike]The buy tool doesn’t list buy offers for you. It simply checks if any are being sold for the input price, and remove buy offers shortly after. Personally, I would like to keep those buy offers up so I can make the purchases I want to once prices go down.[/strike]
[/list]

[b]Overall, this game has a niche audience. It’s a 8 to 10/10 if you are a part of that audience, and a 1 to 3/10 if you’re not.[/b] If this game interests you, go find some well explained gameplay, or give it a shot.
Artifact is a very good card game. Incredibly well balanced, very deep gameplay and a really unique spin on the PC card games that have gotten so popular in recent years. I've no doubt that Artifact will be far more niche than Hearthstone much like DOTA has less players than League but Artifact is thoroughly enjoyable and a very rewarding gaming experience. 

Ignore most of the reviews complaining about monetization. This is a card game. Much like Magic or Pokemon. The packs cost money, the cards cost money. You will have to pay to play. There are ways to earn free cards and there is a free draft mode that will allow you to play with all of the cards in the game and win more cards. Still you will need to pay for certain cards more often than not. There is a marketplace run through Steam that will allow users to buy and sell cards and the cheapest go for $0.03. You'll be able to buy a reasonably competitive deck for <$20. That's opposed to the hours and hours and hours of farming you'd need to do in Hearthstone to get to the same point. And that's only if you want to play constructed. 

Again, Artifact has a free draft mode with all of the cards available. You can play that infinitely to your heart's content. Anyone who is on the fence I'd recommend you buy Artifact and give it a try. You'll know after the tutorial whether or not you want to keep playing and if you don't you can request a refund.
Fantastic, genre-expanding card game from the mind of Richard Garfield. One of the best card games I've ever played with with the ability to sell and purchase single cards on the steam marketplace.
I like being able to actually trade and buy cards. I honestly don't understand the criticism of the monetization method, being that it's the same as all real TCGs.

If you have a problem with buying cards for your game, I don't think card games are right for you.
this game is a masterpiece like you COULD buy packs and tickets OR you could just get good at the game and get packs and tickets WHILE having fun. but if you suck prepare your credit card. 9/10 still not as good as ricochet.
this is a digital card game.  you have to buy the cards, as if they were in real life.  i am ok with that because i have played magic for years and enjoy card games like this.  there is also an option to sell all your extra cards you dont need.

this game has fresh mechanics and is very fun.  

really meant for competitive card game players, but the casual mode if you dont want to spend money is also fun.


Great game. Draft is more fun for me, which you can do for free and doesn't require any cards. After spending my initial packs and tickets I pretty much broke even.

I love that there is 0 grind, I got hooked on some other games playing for daily shit and bonuses and I am glad Valve stays away from such practices and relies on great gameplay to keep people around.

If you want to play constructed game will get a bit more expensive but it seems Valve did a great job of ensuring card prices don't get out of hand (every 2$ pack will at least one highest rarity card), as ccg goes this one is pretty cheap. 

Ignore reviews by entitled crybabies.
Magic, Hearthstone, Faeria, Gwent, Prismata, I've never enjoyed a card game more than Artifact. They've found a way to give you more control over the flow of the game without burdening you with tedium. Almost every decision you make is strategically interesting rather than merely complex. Most other games emphasize Micro and the favorable trade. Artifact is primarily a game about Macro and encourages you to read into your opponent, make plans, and change your plans on the fly. It's been said that Artifact has a low skill-floor and a high skill-ceiling, this is due to the fact that playing into lanes offensively and defensively is intuitive and is enough to win games (with a little luck). But if you're capable of synchronizing a surprise three turn lethal while feinting and stalling your opponent, you can absolutely do that.
This game is incredibly fun, Incredibly affordable, and incredibly polished.  Don't be afraid of the cash you should spend, Its very affordable
I've spent maybe 40$ extra and feel like I have a mostly complete collection

I've played a few online card games but this one has the best gameplay, far more skill-based than any other game. Economics of the cards are fair in my opinion. Do your own research and don't just read the people complaining about p2w, also read the opposite side and make your own decision.
Pros:
-Complex, but fun
-Beautiful artwork
-Well thought out social and competitive modes
-Easy to pick up and put down if you are time constrained

Cons:
-Packs seem a little pricey
-Deck building comes off ambiguous and unclear at times
-Not on mobile yet :P

Overall:
4/5
The game is really good. The depth and complexity is really there for people wanting to get a way from auto-play curve card games. The monetization is pretty decent and is pretty much optional since the draft mode is free to play and gives you a very good experience overall. The initial $20 dollar purchase gives you 10 packs which is just the cost of the game.
It is fun.

Having played a few TCGs in the past the hurdle to get acquainted with the game mechanics is not significant. That being said, the skill ceiling is high and this is only the initial set of cards, promising long lived enjoyment.

The business model is a breath of fresh air to the stagnation of microtransactions for core game content. If you do not want to pay at all after the initial price, you can still play all the game modes without paying anything further. If you want to pay, you can gather cards or play draft with stakes. People asked Ford for faster horses, he gave them automobiles. Please try to learn to drive.
Dont believe most of the reviews here. Is obvious that to play a collective card game you need money (duh).
But there is plenty of modes to play for FREE that let you play even the cards that you dont own. This game is a lot cheaper than HS.
People here are just trolls
It's been sooooo fucking long coming that we have a TCG that actually is complex with the depth of MTG, this comes from someone who absolutely loves CCG's and have collected and played casually over the years, up until around 2014 i started playing hearthstone, and after reaching Legend 14 times it just became a boring grind, because of how dumbed down that game was, all you had to do was netdeck the broken decks (and due to the game fundmentally being retard-proof) you could win with the deck, without issues, now the cards in Artifact arent too complex, the game itself REALLY is, so even a moron netdecker will have issues with Artifact.

I've also seen reviews about people complaining that they need to pay money for cards (have you ever played a fucking card game before hearthstone? lmao) these people have been conditioned by HS to think that its okay to dust £50 worth of cards to create a £3 card. Utter mongoloids.
(Not to mention 90% of the cards in this game sell for £0.03)

I also strongly believe that your collection means more when you've invested into buying them and not just "Ohh let me buy £60 worth of packs, dust everything, and make the £10 worth of cards i need" - Room temperature I.Q HS player.

Now would i enjoy this game more if i have never played DOTA2? Yes, yes i think i would, but do i like it more because i've played dota2? absolutely.




tl:dr

Played HS for 4 years and lost actual braincells playing it, i am finally happy that there is a TCG that i can feel good about winning games with instead of "Haha i played Dr Boom on turn 7, GG shitter"

You LITERALLY feel good about winning in Artifact because you literally can't win if youre stupid.
Complex, deep and breath of fresh air on the card market. Definitely worth it! Monetization is very fair as well, due to being able to buy singles off the Steam market.
I don`t understand why people are bithing about the monetization system, this game is suposed to be like that you buy cards or packs you build decks and battle in paid or free tournaments and the paid ones have prizes that compensate the cost, and don`t even get me started on the card price the most expensive card in game currently is AXE he costs 14$, the next card is 7$, after the fist page 99% of cards are below 1$ tell me how is this game expensive and this date is only 1 day after lounch all the cards will drop even more. AND it`s a excelent card game. Have a nice day.
Gameplay is amazing.  Monetization model is a little odd in some places, but I'd much rather be buying singles than playing the pack lootbox roulette.  Great game thus far.

EDIT: Double thumbs up after the 1.2 update.
I'm old enough to remember saving my money to go my local comic book store to buy Magic: the Gathering booster packs to try to scrape together a good enough deck to play with. Individual cards? No way, man. I couldn't afford it. Know what Magic the Gathering didn't have back in the day? A progression system. Cosmetics. Loot boxes. 

Artifact is dope. It's streamlined enough to be easily accessible but difficult enough to have depth.  I'm concerned about some RNG elements, but hey... it's an old school CCG at heart. Well done, Garfield and Valve. Don't let these negative reviews scare you.
Deep and exhilerating. Once you have the game you can play phantom drafts for free which is fantastic, and cards can be traded freely which means you actually own your decks in a meaningful sense and most decks (that don't include axe) are cheap.
So the game part of Artifact I feel is great. I played few matches and had fun. Also constructing a deck is not as bad as I thought. Once you understand some elements. I like how much elements of Dota were successfully adopted into Artifact and how well they work. 

I feel like maybe the random elements of the game such as where creeps and heroes are played can feel perhaps unfair at times. 

I don't see any fault in charging for this game instead of it being a Free 2 Play game. I just feel that perhaps Valve could have done more to get the point across as to why Artifact is not F2P since we are in a period where it is comon that most games like this are F2P. 

Valve have again been all to silent on this which is sad to see.
A very engaging and elaborate TCG, with many, many different strategies to be utilized.  I have just scratched the surface of this game and can't wait to play more.

Can be overwhelming at first, and expect to lose a large majority of the games when learning, I know I am.
Absolutely wonderful card game. You can play all the modes for free. Including draft! No wasting time grinding for hours just to play your one draft session a week. You can instantly queue up and play anytime! 

People are complaining about the monetization. I find that to be bullshit. I spent 100 dollars in magic area to draft. And felt like my 100 dollars was wasted. The money I spent here felt tangible. Unforced. Not to mention I can sell any of my cards on the steam market to buy any other card I need. I don't ever need to open packs and hope to just get lucky. 

10/10. My new favorite card game.
Really into the game. I've seen lots of reviews where people complain about buying card packs in a card game they paid for, but they dont seem to realise those $20 they paid for it was the price of the card packs they got and they also got gauntlet tickets on top of that. Right now for anyone who didnt have a lucky draw on the first 10 packs and your deck is left wanting, just sell some steam trading cards and buy some of the cards you want from the market. For all of the intent seems to be that this is litteraly a trading card game, just digitized, and if you play and physical ones this game will give you the same feel.
Pay2play > theoretical f2p. Have fun feeling compelled to do dailies everday for other card games and getting dust value back that is worth 1/4 of its crafted cost. Not surprised seeing as how a paid 10 dollar game on the app store gets 0.1% the downloads a f2p game does.
For $20USD you get access to 2 pre-constructed decks that you can take apart and alter and you also get 10 packs to get you started. Considering packs are $2 you're gettings your money's worth. Now to the gamemodes. You get access to free constructed and free draft. Forever. If you've ever played an acutal card game before you know how much fun draft is. You can trial literally every card through draft. There is the option to play "Expert" versions of these gamemodes, if you wish to have a chance at winning prizes(packs), however I would recommend staying away from those until you become familiar with the game, as they require tickets to play, which cost money. Should you end up wanting to play constructed, there are only a handful of cards over $10. If you've ever played YuGiOh, it's quite the refreshment from $100 Ash Blossom, Infinite Impermeance, Zoodiac Barrage, etc. This game is absurdley cheap for what you get and has a surprsing level of depth and intricacy with it's plays. As someone that has sunk thousands of hours and dollars in other card games, this one has the potential to be one of the best.
This is a TCG fanatic's game, not for casuals or stream ganderers.

Mechanically tight and elegantly designed, the balancing of three lanes and semi-persistent heroes creates matches where there is always something you could have done better to pull through for a win.

Draft mode is where it is at, and the pay2win complaining falls kind of moot.
Granted, I've only played around with the main game a bit. However, I will say that I find the mechanics a lot of fun to interact with and the design is fresh. The game feels streamlined and comfortable and is fun to play. What I really wanted to say with this review is how I feel about the aftermarket place. Understand that my feelings may change weeks from now depending on how it shapes up, but I do think that the business model behind this game isn't necessarily a bad thing.

My problem with most digital card games is I don't feel a sense of ownership over what I'm paying for. The aftermarket gives me a chance to get rid of extras and replace them with different commons I may not have picked up from the minimal amount of packs I plan to buy. This is already an interesting angle as it's close to how a regular table top card game works. And as for the initial $20? You go to a local game shop and have interest in a game you see? You're going to pay to pick up your first deck. You want to make changes to that deck? You're going to pay to buy a couple of pack or to get the "best" singles on the marketplace. This doesn't looks like a gatcha grab pay to win business model to me. The fact that it's integrated to a secondary market makes the cards I'm paying for have more value. (This is where I may change my mind in a few weeks after seeing how that works out).

Finally, the pay to play barrier could be a good thing for the game as not everyone will always craft the best cards in the game or pay for the most expensive pieces on the market to follow the meta. The price to build a deck is real which will make people work harder to play with what they have or the limited amount of pickups they purchase over time. This can lead to a more interesting world in match making. "Why did my opponent only play one of that "busted" card? Well, he only had one. He added 2 of another card I've never seen to act as second and third copies." Or, man! I've never seen anyone play those two heroes together. They actually work well in my opponent's deck." The business model here has the potential to breed creativity in the players of Artifact which makes for a much more interesting game on a casual level. On a competitive level? You might get into trouble. 

But how much do truly competitive players spend on other games in the genre? Or, other card games in real life? You want the latest Magic deck that topped? That's gonna cost you a good chunk of change only to rotate a few years later. (Unless you're into extended or legacy). 

I will admit this may all be wishful thinking, but I'm excited for the future of this game to see if it shakes up positive or negative. I haven't spoken much about how the game itself plays but I don't intend this write up to be this type of review. To go into that shortly though, I think it's fresh and I am highly interested to play around more with it. I do wish there was slightly more rewards offered to the modes, but what's there is appealing to me. Thumbs up until the future changes my mind.
Best DCG out there.

Excellent valve quality game.

Sure if you want to play constructed games you need to buy the cards you want to play as in every other collectable card game. Draft mode is completly free and 100 times better than the other DCG.

This is the card game i've been waiting for.

Also, awesome Linux support since day1 flawless.
If you're coming from a background of Hearthstone or Gwent where you can grind for free, you're in for a rude awakening. This game will cost some dollars to play and maintain.

If you're coming from a background of Netrunner or Magic or some other LCG, this is the dream. Incredible depth, available on your laptop, with Valve polish.
Very well designed card game.  The ability to strategically outplay your opponent far surpasses other card games on the market.  A few RNG effects (like cheat death) slightly undermine the great design, but overall it's a fun experience. The  monetization scheme probably needs to change for this to appeal to a wider audience.
The game is as polished as you'd expect a Valve game to be. Ignore the review bombers complaining that Valve isn't showering them with feel good loot drops and free cards.
A good game, but the games take far to long to play, 30 minutes is a short game, should just play an hour long match of DOTA, if you can get past that, worth playing
I really like the game so far. I played many card games before such as Heartstone, Magic, Gwent etc and was really looking towards what Valve had to offer with Artifact. So far it's been a pleasure. The game is deep and engaging with multiple thing to think about. Having to fight on 3 boards is a new thing to me and I find it very unique. 

Also, the economy of this game is very good compared to other games. You can realistically make competitive decks for less than 20$. Many will complain because they have to pay this extra in addition to the game's base price. However, compared to other card games it is dirt cheap. I've payed over 500$ for Magic decks in the past.

I also like how the game handles event tickets. Even if they're 1$ each, these events provide you with hours of fun if you don't completely suck at drafting and playing. It's always exciting fighting when there's something 'on the line'.  If you don't want to put money on drafts, there's also the option to draft for free (without rewards) and draft for free between friends.

Easily recommended!
For anyone who's tired Blizzards RNG simulator and money grubbing by offering you pennies per hour to grind their game. Esentially making you feel like you HAVE to spend money on hearthstone to be worth it's while. Then this may be the game for you.

 Artifact is very upfront with the pricing of the game and packs, and even has a marketplace where you can trade for the cards you need/want. This game heavily encourages players to trade on the market without need to spend thousands on packs like in hearthstone. 

 On top of this they even have a free draft mode that you can play against other players to familiarise yourself with all the cards and once comfortable can spend $1 per entry or dust 20 cards (use the ones valued at $0.02) which will allow access to expert draft where you put up packs against other players and will see a return at 3 or more wins.

In all I believe this game will in the long term be much cheaper than how hearthstone operates where I feel like I'm missing out unless I pre-order every expansion. I'm so glad to be done with the dailies that make you log in and play their game for the sake of the free to play format rather than playing the game when I want to play.
The best card game I've ever played. It's very deep and strategic. You have to think carefully how to counter opponent's action, sometimes you even need to pass to lure the opponent to reveal their trump cards first.

And since it's TCG, I can find any cards I want in the market. No need to buy packs since there are so many sellers out there. Even the most popular cards don't cost you too much if you buy them from the market. You can sell your unused card in the market too.
I would recommend this to everyone. Getting in on Year 1 of this game is like being able to be at the beginning of mtg or hstone, but I think this game will be even better.

I initially had my doubts with the monetization model that Artifact seemed to have, but Valve has really come through with their response to the community's concerns. 

-This is the ONLY card game that allows players to play the draft mode for FREE forever. This is insane to me. I could never imagine MTGA or Hstone allowing players to play arena or draft for free. This alone makes the 20 dollars an absolute bargain. 

--The cheapest draft in MTGA is 5 dollars (granted you can grind 5 days for a free one). 
--Hstone's arena is 2 dollars or 150 gold
--Artifact has 20 dollar upfront cost, but you get 10 packs with content you can sell and after drafting for a while, the cost/draft plummets.

--Artifact also allows infinite free drafts in custom lobbies, so you can play with your friends whenever. 
--MTGA does not have anything like this (they barely just got direct challenge) and drafting in a store is over 12 bucks per run (although you can recoup a bit of the costs selling rares)
--Hstone doesn't have anything like this afaik. 

-Paid modes are not great, but I think they are more than forgiveable with the other free modes Valva has provided. They have also set up a recycle system for worthless commons. 20 cards = 1 event ticket, which I think is pretty generous. 

Overall, this game's greatest weakness is the fact it only has 1 set active, but it has an EXTREMELY bright future.
People are stupid. Here you get like any deck you want lacking maybe 1-2 Cards for 5-7 € directly from the market . Good luck with that in Hearthstone or any other game like this. 

So people want free packs where after months of grind you get half the stuff you need if you are completly f2p over this ?

You can play the draft for completly free which includes ALL cards. So F2P players get all the content like what do you actually want ? You wanna make profit ? This ain't wallstreet.
So far I am enjoying it. Haven't put any extra money in, and just did a fun social draft. Can't wait to go play more of it. Game isn't perfect though.
From the outside look, pay a cost of 20$ would make people hestitate, 
but this game cost a LOT LESS than other card game due to the Market System
Would recommend
this game is stunning. i would definitely recommend you to try this game (even if you don't like dota 2)

BUT
1. i don't really get why this game is SO frickin' expensive?
2. why is dota 2 free then? (i know that theres in-game purchases but still)
3. i just payed to play this game and i have to pay much more for the full experience, that sucks dude
4. okay, let's take two popular card games like hearthstone and gwent.. oh what's that? ah yeah, they are FREE and they DO have and in-game purchases like any other normal game these days

so valve, please listen to us (like you never do lmao) and lower the price of this game for at least 10$ USD

anyways i still recommend you to give it a shot and see for yourself

(btw i sold my dota 2 inventory just to buy this game and now im mad)
It's a good game and even just the FREE phantom draft mode justifies the price tag.. Pauperformat can be played by just putting 10 extra euros in. It's not free, it's not cheap (it actually is if you don't plan on playing constructed) but it certainly isn't as expensive as people make it out to be.

edit: I did get my money out of it in terms of playtime but this game has a lot of problems that are yet to be fixed.
The outrage for this games price is so lame. I understand we should not be backing a game that wants you to spend money on it but this game could compare to what the creator made, Magic. Cards are all worth money. But that does not mean the game is expensive. The most expensive card on the market right now is Axe, who has been moving below and over $20, right now he is $13. If you are looking to finish off a deck the average price of a cards I have had to buy is 10 cents. There are some rare heroes that range a for a couple bucks but honestly is that how far we let it go to give it a bad review? 

If Hearthstone were on Steam is would be crippled by reviews, Artifact is surpringly cheap to compete, and you cards actually have value to sell and look for other options. I hope reviews level out, and people calm down. The virtual aspect of the game seems to push back the idea that a card has value, the game is $20 for the reason of giving the cards value. 

There was a reddit post that put together all the prices and totalled it to be about $170 dollars for the whole set. This is day 1, cards will start going down over time with more and more packs to open, and around the time of that post Axe was about 12% of the price of the game. 

I really enjoy the gameplay and will have fun putting decks together. I can compete with the 5 free tickets given to me for more packs, and craft or sell my bonus cards to use for anything I would like. I would say the price of this game for most players should be $30. You can easily round out a ton of decks with that price, and if you really feel like getting a strong rare hero you can shell an extra $10, or at most currently: $13.
After I played many online TCG, I can tell you that Artifact is at the moment one of the cheapest when you wanna create a top tier deck. Most cards cost nothing on the marked expect a few.

The Gameplay is unique and its a welcome change to magic arena (what I still play too).  Since Heardstone was always to simple for me, I wouldn't even compare this game to heardstone. We get way more strategic depth with artifact.
Amazingly intuitive and polished game with a new twist on card combat.
Never found the mechanics hard to grasp, and as a Dota player everything makes sense.
Love the longer form of games. In MTG: Arena most games are over in 5 minutes. Be ready to have a battle of wits for 30 minutes in Artifact.

I really don't understand why a lot of people are so up in arms about the monitization.
As a longtime Magic: The Gathering player, I can attest this is a lot cheaper than that. And Valve obviously made it this way 
 to explicitly force cards to hold their value over time, just like real TCGs. I applaud the move towards a more serious type of game.

Modern CCG games have made a habit of rewarding players for playing, by giving unlocks and coins, Artifact remembers what's actually fun about playing: the game itself without having to lure the players in with some fancy points that expire at the end of each day to force them to keep playing.

I scheme you can buy this game, never once buy a single booster pack, and still get hours upon hours of good quality entertainment out of it. If you want some more variety there's a bunch of free decks to play with, and you can borrow a friend's deck at any time.

I don't understand the internet and it deciding that everybody must now climb on the hate train. Just try the game, you'll love it.
Excellent game.

Every play feels impactful.  Almost every match is very tense and the cards turned out to be very cheap compared to what people on Reddit (almost always wrong 
) Thought.  I opened a drow and time of triumph in my first packs .

This game is extremely competitive and I predict will be a very good esport.
This is the most cheap card game to play competitively at this moment. Buying absolutely all the existing cards in the game costs around 100$ at this moment even when prices are extremely inflated because of hype, whereas a competitive deck in HS costs 300-400$ or requires you to grind infinitely opening random packs.

If you're a 100% casual who doesn't really care about the quality of a game and just wants to click a couple of buttons and have flashy popups saying you leveled up, yes the F2P HS alternative is better for you, If you are a bit serious about games and want to get competitive without spending 300-400$ like you need to in HS, this game is definitely for you. This gameplay is multiple times better than HS though, hence the price tag.
When I played pokemon TCG in real life 20 years ago wizards of the coast rewarded me and sent me a card pack everytime I played 5 games with my friends. They would just mail me a booster pack. They also randomly gave me starter decks for free. I was then able to just jump on my computer and list the cards for sale and theyd magically vanish from my posession and money would appear in my wallet. The company made money and I made money this was fair.
This game is great, with incredible depth, and offers alot more per dollar than other games in it genre. Dont listen to the haters who need games to be f2p.
I've only put like 5-10 hours into the game so far but I've been enjoying every bit of it. The basics of gameplay revolves around battling it out on 3 lanes with your heroes/spells/minions from your deck. Between rounds you can buy items with gold you've earned from minion/hero kills to help out your heroes. You must deal 40 damage in 2 lanes to the towers defending them, or 40 in one lane and then 80 to the ancient behind the tower there.

The deck building is some of the most unique I've seen with the 5 heroes you pick being a core part of your deck, and deciding which colors you'll have available your deck. Each hero is associated with one of the four colors: Red, Blue, Black, and Green, and has their own unique stats of Attack, Armor, and Health as well as 3 of the same signature card unique to that hero that are included in 40 card your deck. The item deck built seperately from your main deck can help you shore up some weaknesses, like low health blue heroes using Stonehall Cloak or Traveller's Cloak to increase their health and stay alive early game, though some of these items can win you games on their own like Horn of the Alpha (25 gold: equivalent to 5 hero kills) generating a 14/14 unit every 2 turns.

I've really enjoyed the gameplay so far, though I feel like I haven't really scratched the surface of fully understanding the depth in this game. Knowing when to pass for initiative even though you have a spell/minion you can play in the current lane is huge. Initiative allows you to play cards before your opponent, possibly making game changing plays in that lane such as stunning or killing your enemy's heroes leaving them unable to play cards in that lane. You also have to be aware of what is happening in each of your 3 lanes this and future turns. You have limited resources and need to know when/where they would be used best.

Buying the game provides you with 10 packs and 5 event tickets. There's no free way in game to earn cards/packs/tickets, though there is a marketplace for cards which allow you to buy cards you need for constructed from other players, with a 15% fee going to Steam. You can however play draft unlimited for free, some believe this is the best/most fun game mode but I can say Constructed has been super fun so far too. Luckily I opened up about $15 dollars worth in cards from my 10 packs included. I sold off cards I wasn't interested in or thought might be overrated and bought up some cards to build a deck with. 

It's likely not a tier 1 deck but if you're playing casual matchmaking or with your friends you can easily still compete, I've won my first 5 games with this sweet Red/Blue swarm control deck using Luna, Beastmaster, Kanna, Tidehunter, and Timbersaw. Kanna at the time of writing this was about $6-7 but I was lucky enough to find her in my 10 included packs. Each of these other heroes only cost me $0.30 or less each. 

Do I recommend this game? Yes, if you're looking for a new TCG with interesting deck building/gameplay and are willing to spend a few bucks to build a constructed deck. Keep in mind if you are wanting to build a Tier 1 competitive deck you will need to spend some money, it's hard to say how much as the prices are fluctuating quite a bit so close to launch, though if I had to guess it would be around $50 depending on the colors/heroes you plan on using. If you're only interested in draft you can play that mode for free endlessly so that is another thing to consider.
Great gameplay and tons of fun. The demonization of the monetization model are unwaranted in my opinion. $20 price tag along with no trading help prevent scams. If you didn't want to spend another cent the free draft could keep you busy for a very long time.
Very interesting game with a lot of depth.  Unlike Hearthstone you have 3 boards to control.  Unlike smashing the face of the hero you have to destroy each tower, 40 health.  After a tower is destroyed it leaves an ancient, 80 health.  To win you have to destroy 2 towers.

There are 5 hereos you have, you spawn with 3, one in each of the three lanes.  When a hero is destroyed by other heroes or minions/creeps they need a turn to rest, they keep all their items, but I don't think they keep spell effects.  Heros can be buffed by buying items, like healing them or giving them armor and weapons or more health.  Unlike in hearthstone where your core hereo cannot really be buffed beyond using its hero power.

Simply put there is a LOT more depth to the game, is it super complex?  No, but there is a LOT to learn with all the mechanics that are straight forward.

Money wise:
I spend almost $100-$200 each HS expansion so spending money is no stranger in any card game imo.  What is awesome is if you want a card, unlike spending dust, which for legendaries in HS is a nightmare, you can simply buy the card for as little as $0.04.  Now if your not as poor as a goblin peddling bad hobbit pipe weed, this should be easy for you to afford, especially in comparision to other card games.  It does miss the free to play elements like dailies, so for competitive players you will need to open a lot of packs or buy select cards, which isn't a big deal.

On average it is just about as expensive as HS, and yes I wish there were dailies to open packs as well which motivated players to play, which I'm sure they might change in the future.

But the fact that there are so many unique color/combos and items that you can use gives this game a lot of depth and creativity that hearthstone lacks.

The game is built for advanced players imo, and probably will take a lot more skill to master than hearthstone which also relies more and more on RNG elements.  You can even fortify towers and give lanes buffs and cross buff other lanes.

Being a multiple legend HS player, and an angry orc most of the time, I would recommend this game and give it a solid 8/10 for now, but it is probably the best card game on the market so far, and it is something new and fresh.
THIS GAME IS FREAKING INTENSE!!!
EVERY GAME IS FREAKING INTENSE!!!

The games you win feels very nice and worth it whilst the ones you lose feels like you could've done something better to prevent that scenario from happening.
It never feels like a one sided match.

While you do need to get lucky in terms of getting cards from packs, the phantom draft is very fun and you get free packs from winning the set games.

If you have the time and skill, I suggest you grind the draft first rather than spending tons of cash just to get that 1 card you wanted.
I really like this game. It is more strategic than any other card game I have ever played. The gameplay itself feels more like chess.

Everyone who complains about the monetization doesn't understand how economics work. If you don't like buying cards, don't want to pay to win packs, just don't play constructed, what's the fun in following the meta and copying other's decks anyway?

You can play draft for free forever. More deck building. More fun. No meta decks. No additional payment required.
Excellent card game! While a few thing have to be imnproved (Better ways to join open tournaments, Ladder etc.) Valve already adressed those issues. 
When the community marked settles in a few days you'll probably be able to get the game+most of the cards( IF not all) for a AAA game price! 

Dont listen to people who say the monetisation sceme is terrible. It's not perfekt but WAY better than most other card games.
This game is probably the funnest card game I've played online.
I love the game play and the cards, the art style and the lore.

I know alot of people are upset with the way the game is monetized and they have every right to be, but personally I don't mind it as it lets me get the cards I need when I want them, and its just like a real life TCG unlike all ther other CCG's out there.

but this is all just my opinion.
Definitely worth the $20 dollars out of the box. Yes, you don't get all the cards. No, there is no way to grind or earn stuff for free. 

This is a deep card game that blows away HS and Gwent in my opinion. I want to sit down and have a mental battle. This game checks that box with the base offering. You get draft for free and rotating events. If you want to have all the cards or run constructed decks, you'll probably have to pay a bit. You can literally get all cards minus rares (a huge and playable amount) for under like 30 bucks day of launch and prices are dropping.

If you want a fun, deep, polished card game that offers draft and events, plus other options at more investment, then Artifact is the game for you.
You get to  just draft for free as much as you like, after years of playing magic: online its pretty awesome to be able to draft without paying for it (just the $20 the game costs) never been much of a constructed player since its all just net decks so the "monetisation" of it doesn't bother me, just play the superior free mode.
So everyone is complaining about the p2w format...

In the beginning, I´d like to point out that 2 most expensive cards on marketplace right now are Axe - 14$ and Drow - 10$. Price will probably drop in the future, and i think that you can definitely play without these 2 heroes competitively... I think that you can build your deck around 1$-6$ it really depends on many factors... But in my opinion if u can afford to buy the game for 20$ you surely can afford to buy a deck for another 6$.... And you even get 10 packs for free and 5 event tickets, and with this u can do all the magic... JUST DONT WASTE YOUR EVENT TICKETS, you need to understand the game at first to be able to compete for the prizes in expert mode.... Do you even realize that if youre collecting REAL LIFE trading cards, you will pay probably like 5$ for single booster pack?! 

In the end id like to say that i think Artifact is the best card game i have ever played, Its worth the money and it will keep you entertained for a while!
I dont mind spending money on games.
But this game is balanced around money. There are cards clearly stronger than others and purposely so.
So i dont want to rate this game good unless they acctually balance the game.
Apart from that, a good player will win more often and this game has a ton of potential if balanced.

Editing my review:
This game is not balanced and costs money not only to play but for competing currently. However even with the major flaws, the game is insanely fun, strategic.
It is without a doubt the best game current in the market (come on gwent).
So i am recommending this game in hopes that the major issues get fixed.
Incredible fun for a relatively minimal price. Keep in mind you can sell the cards you open in your starter kit, and just play a ton of phantom events for free!
great gameplay with lots of constant difficult decision-making. i can buy my ideal deck for $40 on day one, for a total $60 cost, less than most AAA titles. or I can keep playing gauntlets for prizes, and eventually build up to a full collection for only $20.
Pricing is atrocious and will probably kill this game if valve doesn't fix it.

That said if you like TCGs and draft the endless free draft mode is easily worth the price of admission. Just don't buy a single microtransaction till they fix all their bull.
The game is great, no longer are you only relying on your top deck to win a game. Two people playing the same deck will not have 50/50 chance on winning. A good player would win 3/4 times more than the netdecker, it's that great!

The monetization is fine, it's even better than F2P-models.

I bought Artifact at 20€ I paid 5€ extra and with that i can buy almost all the cards I need to make a new Deck. I still have 1€ lying arround and two cards for sale at 3.5€. The average cost price of a card is 0.10€ (most of the time 0.01 or 0.05).
Sure some cards are priced 1 or 2€ (even 12€ for one specific card, lol). But you don't need them.
Even if you do, a Hero card, you only need to buy it once for 4 Cards.

I spent less money on Artifact than any other F2P card game (HS & MTGA) and got to try a lot more different decks!
Pros:
- Very complex game
- Game is pretty simple to under once you're able to play 1 or 2 games despite how complex it is
- You can sell your cards (or trade them in the future(?))
- Casual Draft

Cons
- Axe
- Kanna
- Lich
- Drow Ranger
A deep card game with a lot of upside. I personally believe there is a lot of misrepresentation of the monetization from those who normally don't play TCG games.
1. $20 price tag - For the price you get 10 boosters priced at $2, 5 event tickets worth $1 each, 2 starter decks. Overall you are coming out ahead.
2. Marketplace - the marketplace takes the rng out of the collection aspect which is underestimated. Having the ability to specifically purchase the card I need versus opening packs at $2 a piece is honestly welcomed. Seeing a streamer spend $300 with no Axe is just depressing, at this time you but the full set off the market 1.5 times for that.
3. Casual phantom draft - This addition is fantastic. The ability to play draft with all available cards for free to practice is excellent. Being able to genuinely practice drafting and learning the game before wasting event tickets is something other games should look into.

The game isn't perfect, but this is all a learning curve for Valve. Card prices will fluctuate, but they will generally drop over the coming days as more copies are agreed to the market, Valve will collect information and make system and balance adjustments, and I believe the game will grow and evolve given time. 

The recycle system being added so quickly gives me hope for their willingness to listen to suggestion and criticism.
Despite the game not being F2P you do get quite a lot of cool options just for the initial purchase. The Free Draft mode + tournament system alone make this game a great purchase for its value. Definetly worth for anyone who wants to try out a new card game.
This game is an instant classic. Honestly Richard Garfield's crowning achievement, which is really saying something. The future for this game is very bright, there are just so many knobs that can be tweaked.
After a rocky start, valve have really turned it around with the decision to do incremental balancing and the adding of a progression system. The game is really enjoyable to play now.
The gameplay of this game, at least for me, is way better than any other card game out there. That said, many people are concerned about how to get cards in this game. Right now there is no way, to get cards from just playing. But there is the steam market, which acatually makes this game really cheap if you compare it to other Trading Card Games. 

While building a deck you can see which cards are still left, and how much they cost on the market. You should treat this game like a real TCG. If you do that, you will see, that this game and its steam market puts you in a very good spot to get exactly the cards you want, without the grind. Yes, you will have to pay for them, but at least you know what you get and you don't have to rely on card packs. You also can sell cards your own to make some money.

So overall this business model actually plays out pretty well, at least from my perspective. That said, putting in some money is a necessity. Try to inform you about the business model of this game (there are many sources out there on the internet). It is not as bad as many people want to belive.
Absolutely the best card game and one of the best games overall I have ever played. Each game requires you to think on your feet and plan ahead to win the game. There is no best line of play to memorize as there are so many variables. The monetization is really not a problem if you get good at playing before risking in expert mode. I made over $105 already and plan on increasing that.
Very fun card game, lots of strategic depth and influential decision making.  Fair amount of RNG, but enough ways to influence it to where losing games almost always feels like your fault due to mistakes.  I haven't had any games where I've felt like I couldn't have possibly done anything better.  My only other card games have been a fair amount of Magic and Gwent.

Monetization isn't as bad as other people are making it out to be, in my opinion.  If you are good enough, you can sustain and continue to earn cards through phantom drafts for free, but mathmatically speaking only a minority of players will ever be able to do this.  Card prices are not reflective yet of what their final prices will be, and I suspect that competitive decks will be significantly cheaper than currently predicted as more packs are opened.
This is an interesting take on the card game genre and I really like the gameplay. That being said I do think that the current economie of the game needs some tweaking. Currently the only way to get new cards is to buy them or buy tickets to compete in tournaments in order to win packs. I like the idea of cards having real value and understand giving free packs away would undermine that but I think they could have done it a little different. Like offering passes that allow you to grind for cards.
I believe valve will listen to the community and make the necissary changes and since the gameplay is fun I'd recommend this game to anyone that likes trading card games and doesn't mind spending some money.
Brilliantly designed card game, and the business model is nowhere near as bad as people are making it out to be. My only fault with it is the fact that there's no direct trading, either allowing that or removing the 15% marketplace "tax" would make it so much better.

EIther way, you can play the game forever including all of the premium shite as long as you're better than at roughly 50% of players. You can earn infinite packs and tickets this way by playing the expert draft and just recycling unwanted cards you get from pack wins into extra tickets in case you lose any.
A polished, extremely complex card game, a massive amount depth in just this initial set. The complexity comes from all the usual card game resources (Tempo, Cards, board state) multiplied by 3 for each lane with the addition of gold and items. compared to 

The matches I have played are always very tense, playing across 3 boards leads to very interesting situations where both players are trying to figure out where to commit their resources and maybe trying to bluff the other player into overcommitting somewhere.

The user interface for both deck building and actual play is the best I have seen it's simple, intuitive, and powerful.

Notably missing is a progression component, which I hope is in the works. 

Seems the monetization is the main complaint of most, it being almost identical to magic the gathering online (another game I  enjoy) it doesn't bother me, seems well worth the money in fact. Although a rewards system in the style of hearthstone is something I wouldn't say no to, but the lack of it leads to a more 'pure' experience that's about enjoying the game and not grinding gold.
Gameplay is exceptionally satisfying and strategically deep. Not everyone will enjoy the game forever, but for some people, you will be instantly hooked. It's definitely worth a try. 

For those of you worried about the monetization, it's genuinely not that bad. The primary game modes are all free to play, and rotating free events add variety to the mix. If you love draft modes, you can play that all day,  every day without spending a dime. Constructed players may have to invest a bit for a top tier deck, but the market place makes building a new deck simple and easy to understand costs to build "dream decks". If you're an obsessive collector, and absolutely must own every card, cost of completion is around the $160 mark. But I want to stress to anyone who balks at that number, you do not need to own every card.
Played the beta, this is hands down my favourite card game... Its probably going to take some time for people to adjust to the econ, and the game itself does need tweets but so far im really enjoying it.
Fun game. Animations are very polished. It does cost $20 but you get 10 free packs, 2 tickets and 2 starter decks for free with the game. In the shop, 10 packs cost $20 so you kinda do get ~$25 of value from a $20 game so yeah? its kinda free to play if you were going to buy packs anyway???
Love this game! It also isn’t expensive at all overall and especially not compared to other physical tcgs.  Some people are obsessed with f2p but my time is a resource and I’d rather spend a little money than all of my time grinding cards.  There are still some features that I’m looking forward to Valve adding but overall I’m really excited about what they’ve done!
Excellent gameplay, one of the best card games I've ever played. Deep and complex, but not so difficult to learn.

It feels gratifying to win, and even when you lose you had a good game and could put up a fight, not like in many other games where you often are in auto-pilot and spectating how the match unfolds. There is enough RNG to relieve pressure and allow the weaker player to sometimes win, but it is nealry always RNG that you can work around. In Artifact bad luck feels like extra challenge, not the frustration that you couldn't do anything.

Be aware that you will have to pay more than the initial price if you want to play constructed competitively.

But you can do a lot without micro transactions: inifinite draft, pre-constructed decks events, play with friends with casual decks.
So far the most enjoyable ccg I ever played(out of 10-15 which isn’t much).

Mostly because of design choices like making the starter mana 3, which reduces idle turns, making 3 lanes which means that if you are not lucky on one you don't just lose like in other games but you can just aboundon it and still win on other lanes. Also “money cards” that are independent from mana. Siege cards that are independent from lanes. Consistent hero buffs. And the random spawn placement and targeting is rather good than bad. A bit of randomness adds dramatic events.

In general just a good ccg. 

The pricing is kind of bad. The nature of it is the design choice to use steam’s card trading system(and make money from it). Because of that they were forced to make the game pay2play. To fill the market with initial cards. And that is why they can’t add any way to earn free cards, because prices of card would drop. Same thing with the payed tickets. And at this point they can’t just redesign the whole system.

But. They added a free versions of the payed modes. You can’t get rewards. But do you really need them? Not really. The random draft modes are the most fun ones anyway. So you don’t really need to pay to have fun. 

A good way to calm the pricing outrage  down could be for example:
[h1]Giving 1 free ticket every week to those who have 0.[/h1]
It will give people who lost all their initial tickets a chance to play again without damaging the market and valve’s income too much.
I will get my complaints out the way first. Complaints valid as of 29/11/2018, these problems may not exist in a future version of the game.

1. The game does not have a free in-game currency like the coins in hearthstone
2. You can exchange cards for a ticket (which don't guarantee getting a prize) but not for an in-game currency like dust in hearthstone
3. There should be a separate timer for each turn as suddenly u can get 15 seconds remaining without knowing how much time you had in the first place
4. There is no message at the start of your turn, the small coin flipping over is not that noticeable
5. Packs are very expensive - like every microtransaction
6. No in-game chat - using steam overlay can take you out of the game

Valve has done a good job adapting DOTA 2 into a card game. They have achieved a great mix of fantastic visuals, music, gameplay, and added their own unique spin into the card game genre. I have been pleasantly surprised at the amount of veriety offered on release by this game which offeres many more game modes than hearthstone did at release. It provides new players with pre-built decks to play around with without spending any money and allows richer players to test their strategic might against other rich people further dividing the lower and upper classes of society and therefore, I am sure it will be another great money-maker for Valve. Now they just need to add DOTA 2 style cosmetics for each hero and this will be a perfect capitalist game where you have to spend money at every corner.

Too capitalist but, good game 9/10
Very good game. Hard to play as there are many choices you have to make. Get ready for lot of learning.

Beware. This is not f2p game and as it is common with valve there are many things missing at the moment like some kind of ladder/progression. They promised to implement it
really good card game , free phantom drafts
-Not like HS where each expansion will take you 4ever to grind or 100$ out of your pocket (market will be cheap)
-There is RNG but it can be countered by your skills (in most cases)
Great complex game with all the hallmarks of something special. The games are long and complex and strategic, it definitely feels less like a quickfire TCG game and more like a Moba, which makes sense as it's a relation to DotA2.

It's immensely fun, and tense throughout.

All in all, a great game which I'm looking forward to playing much more of in the coming months.

My nerves can only take 1 game a night, as I'm mentally exhausted by the end. So many twists and turns!
Reasons to buy Artifact:

- finally a good digital TCG
- you can easily sell/buy cards on the market
- much cheaper than other card games
- very complex and strategic
- no grinding
- in-game tournaments
- it's the best-looking card game, beautiful UI and graphics
- THE LORE (+there is a comic)
- VALVE made it

What's missing:

- you can't trade with other people at the moment
- no progression system (but VALVE is working on it)

Don't think hearthstone, think MtG. This is a TCG not a Card game like hearthstone.

Gameplay is fun and engaging. It may be that it is new, or that is Dota themed but I enjoy it more than heartstone and MtG The monetization is fine if you're okay with Magic 

The basic starter pack in magic is $24 (on average from looking just now) and you get 125 actual card. This is $20 and you get 100 cards. 

If you want more cards you buy the actually ones you want from some random or you buy a pack, like magic.

You are not just given packs or cards randomly, again like magic. 

You can earn them though, playing draft gives you the chance to win packs. Win some games and you get packs. If you are bad and lose everything you don't get anything. Just like going to draft days with Magic. 

Each pack being $2.65 AUD is not really fair I think though, it's more than a magic pack which doesn't make sense to me since you don't actually have to print these cards off.  That's my only complaint really. 

If you have not played a lot of magic because of the prince than this probs wont do it for you. But if you have you'll find nothing crazy price wise here, just some fun af gameplay.
Strategic card game with variety of cool cards and combos combined with interesting game modes besides smooth gameplay
and amazing music. This game is worth atleast a try.
A collaboration between legendary game designer Richard Garfield and Valve, Artifact offers the deepest gameplay and the highest-fidelity experience ever seen in a trading card game.
I really enjoy the mechanics and if you play well enough you can get infinite cards/event tickets. While I'm not necessarily a fan of the monetization, I understand that is how they aim to give the cards market value. *Shrug* Oh well. It's fun to play with friends.
I think if you really like card game and willing to pay money to buy expansion cards, this game would be a great game for you,   I don't want to remenber so many detail and caculate the damage. so I deside to quit this game, bye bye.
Everybody complaining about money-aspect of the game, forgetting that this game has one of the best cardgame gameplay EVER.
So even if it's just for a draft, without spending more than the 20 dollars entry fee, make yourself a favour, and try it.
Mechanically, this is the card game to look at for a card game that uses the digital environment to the fullest. Tons of fun, quite polished and very rewarding to learn. Just like DOTA, you'll be learning new concepts for weeks and maybe months after you start playing.

As for the monetization, the big elephant in the room for many: The prices are currently high, but I hardly expect those to stay high at all. In the long term, I expect Artifact to be the cheapest card game around by a large margin. 

The pack prices are incredibly fair, there is no discount for buying large amounts of packs at once and you're very likely to at least get your money back from the packs. There is also no free-to-play grinding seen in similar free-to-play games, and I couldn't be happier about this. 

Free-to-play currencies and quests often equates to a tiny discount on buying packs, often multiple times lower than minimum wage. As such, the free-to-play currencies are a downside for every player group. If you don't mind spending a bit and aren't a whale, you're going to be spending more because pack prices have to take the 'f2p currency discount' into consideration. If you're entirely free-to-play, you're generally going to feel like you're progressing at a snail's pace and far behind anyone that did buy packs. If you're a whale, you're just paying more than you have to because of the pack prices being inflated.

Artifact solves these issues in a great way: You can buy the game and then play for free, forever! There are even ways to progress your collection off the initial tickets. And a month down the line when card prices have stabilized? You'll probably be able to pick up a tier 1 meta deck for less than you paid for the game itself. 

All in all, I think Artifact is a game with amazing mechanics and depth. The polish is amazing, but I'd like to see that promised progression mechanic implemented just to tie things together. I can't wait to see how the market shapes up and look forward to many years of Artifact to come. :)
Absolute wrecking game. Was so hyped about it and now its finally there. The Payment model is a little bit messy, but if you informed yourself before it shouldn't surprise you. Gameplay,animation and voice acting are awesome so what? 4,5/5
There should be a free ranked contructed game mode. I gaurentee making a deck in this game is way cheaper than in hearthstone. Most common cards are around 4p and and nearly every rare is below £3. Problem is there are no rewards at the moment unless you are spending money on tickets. Gameplay is great.
Decent enough card game - it has cardpacks as microtransactions though.. so make of that what you will. 
Cards can also be bought and sold on the marketplace. 
Single games can take up to 30 minutes to complete, good allround tactical game played across three sections of board make for it to be a decent strategy card game

Slightly better than Hearthstone imo. 

60/100


Pros
+ Simple to learn, hard to master.
+ Animations and voice lines are on point.
+ Music.
+ Most of the card art, only one is terrible and I'd say that's Lion.
+ Free Draft.
+ Hosting tournaments with lots of different rule sets.
+ Ability to buy the cards you want directly instead of praying to RNG.

Cons
- Time turner is a bit high some people spend 1-2 mins per turn which can make the game drag on.
- Game can be expensive if you care about constructed.
- Some of the colours are a bit IMBA at the moment, Red and Black seem ahead of the curve.

Total Score: 9/10

I personally don't care to much about deck building, I enjoy just drafting. Games can go on a little long so reducing turn times down could be a good start. Heroes are an excellent idea even if some of them need tweaking to bring them a bit closer.

Highly recommended.
Even though havent played much, I'll recommend this game since a lot of people are downvoting for stupid reasons like servers were not working well for half an hour on launch day etc.

Regarding pay to win rage, vast majority of the cards can be bought in market for less than 10 cents and up to 50. Axe value already dropped double, its realease day people I dont think game is going to be very expensive. You also have free modes to play so...
This game plays like a heavy strategic board game, it has a tough learning curve but rewards you with much more depth than you'd expect to find in a card game. This game is not Hearthstone or Clash Royale, it's a turn based strategy game with hugely variable starting setups to keep it fresh. It is a tense battle of wits with an onslaught of interesting decisions to be made.

There are a lot of negative reviews about the monetisation of this game but you can definitely enjoy it without investing a ton of money, the draft modes add even more depth that pre-constructed deck games and allow you access to all the cards in the game so there's no requirement to buy all the cards for the top 'meta' decks. If you're interested in constructed modes and building a collection I think the market and keeper drafts allow you to do this at a reasonable price compared to other similar CCG's.

The event tickets required for expert competitive play are reasonably priced for the amount of time such events take and add extra tension because you've got something real at stake. I know that's not for everyone but you can have plenty of fun without it.
Amazing game. For those who don’t want to pay more than $20 you can play the multiple free modes available. Or you can spend a literal couple of bucks on the market and make a commons-only deck to compete in commons-only tournaments.
Valve fixed the game. They nerfed the broken cards. Got rid of dumb rng cards. Buffed garbage heroes. Added a free progression system that gives some free packs. 

If you stopped playing I highly suggest you give it another try its arguably one of the best cardgames on the market now. The cards are also cheaper than ever now so its not a bad time to get into it if you haven't tried it yet.
Not recommending until they add some way to collect cards without paying. 

Everything else is really fantastic, though. Of the few games I've played all have been great and one of my most recent matches was one of the most intense and exciting games I've ever had playing any card game. I really like how cards now have a Steam market value, but tying everything exclusively to the market is pretty ridiculous for Valve to think players would be fine with that, and shouldn't be tolerated. Steam's already making a bunch of money on the market transactions anyways, I don't know why players can't earn money themselves if Valve will always make a percentage every time a card swaps hands. It would be cool to grind for cards to sell so you could buy the ones you really want. It's much better than hoping you get good odds in a pack opening, and makes players play the game instead of just throwing in money.

I'm pretty optimistic that this will change however, since playing the game doesn't feel like it's a quick cash grab even though they spent very few resources on making it. A long term economy would be better than a short lived game. Submitting negative Steam reviews might help. Who knows.

Update:

Yeah, they did it.
game bad rng gay fuckin dab on the haters :^) nice bow geek and gamer gunk and garbage i hate women
Hey Lois, remember that time I took AP Chem then quit because I wasn't ever supposed to be in it?
The cutaway gag begins with Peter in high school, looking exactly the same. He is sitting at a lab table with his friends, also the same as usual, on the other side. Barack Obama enters the room.

"Oh my god, Barack Obama, former president of the United States? You're the chemistry teacher?"

"Yes I am, Peter, I took up teaching after I was done with politics." Obama shivers. "Damn that Donald Trump, he'll never be as good at getting out of work with golf."

Peter and the gang laugh. "So what's the smell? Are we making fondue today?" Peter pulls out a small container of something, with a wire running from it to the wall. He immediately starts to drink it.

"Peter no that's hydrochloric acid!" Obama takes the acid from Peter as he's only had a small amount. "This is a chemistry class, not cooking."

"Damn it." Peter runs out of the room making a funny sound.

A few seconds pass in silence.

Joe awkwardly says "so no on the cooking?"
(Peter is seen out a window falling over and dying.).

An excellent card game. Loads of fun, deep, but still accessible for casual players. Draft mode is awesome, free unlimited drafts. Not for the extreme impatient and not paying attention players - you will lose your games.
I play...
- DotA ✓
- MtG ✓
- Hearthstone ✓
-Armello ✓

TLDR; game fun but game long and game expensive but also slightly [strike]underdeveloped[/strike] a brainlet, high hope for big brain update

>>So my views may or may not be biased<<


PROS:
-Mechanics
-Artstyle
-DotA content is on par with the actual moba
-Fresh new feel to cardgames
-Unique
-Very competitive vibe 
-Built in tourney mechanics and group play mechanics, very easy to create and assemble

CONS:
-Pay to Win (almost like any other cardgames)
-No progession mechanics like hearthstone where you can grind for packs and etc. (quests, objectives, etc.)
-Long ass animations though are eye appealing but after a while it gets obnoxious
-I wouldn't say its worth $20, more so between $10 and about $15
-NO SPECTATING OPTION CREATED YET!

I haven't played CGs before but this one is easy to pickup once you played the tutorial. You can tell from the get-go it has deep gameplay potential and relies more on player skill than luck. As they say, "easy to learn, difficult to master" which is a good sign for a competitive game.
Been hyped about Artifact for the past week. Played ~3 drafts 4-2, 0-2, 4-2, and it's very different from other CCGs right now. The depth and complexity that comes with the decision making is very interesting. I agree with Reynad's point that the feedback for your decisions aren't very clear whether they were good or not, but that comes with time. Definitely worth checking out. Being able to draft infinitely with a $20 investment is worth it to me. Getting a full set is about 300 as well.
The game is cool and fun, but i honetly hate thoes little dragons, may you could put a option to desactivate them... please

And what is the deal whit the spanish translation, they translated literlay what the heroes names mean, like tinker is claled inventor and LG is caled the comandant of the legion.

If only getting new cards weren't such a hassle. 

First of all, the gameplay is top notch and can be intense most of the time, when different built decks collide and different players and different playstyle battle it out -  its thrilling, its intoxicating. It could be more!

But that intensity is lost when a player has a higher premium in their card collection compared to the other, so there will be times when playing a 20 to 40/50 [even 60] minutes match (which should be long, exciting and overwhelming) - its purpose as a game as a whole is completely defeated by having to surrender 2 to 5 minutes in due to monetization that can at times give an unfair starting advantage.

So you pay A$30 for starting packs and some boosters like everyone else. Cool. But I don't wanna keep buying cards that aren't tangible, so sometimes it doesn't make sense. But Valve is the developer and publisher, so they own the market and IP - reminder that Artifact needs to compete with the other Digital Card Games and their prices in order to appear reasonable to a player.

I'd advise Valve to allow the community to judge the price of a card (or a pack) and allow reward packs  - generous rewards - not that cheap, unwanted and unfulfilled reward system. 

Still, the neglect and heartache fans, communities and hobbyists have suffered throughout years since Trading Card Games were concieved is present. It will improve - many games have had poor launches in the past.

And! When people pay for a game they shouldn't feel swindled once they've dipped their toes into the deep end.

Oh, and what a shame that a game developed with so much passion is reduced to cinders by poor initial payment scheme.
This game is everything i wanted/waited so long! Playing since release 13 hours already and still not planning to get some sleep... I cant stop playing!
Artifact is a very unique card game. It has lots of interesting mechanics, and ways to play. Some people hate this game solely because of the microtransactions. Well, if you were to play a real card game like MTG or Pokemon, you'd be spending money on every single card you use too. It's not fair to say a game is bad based on how the genre typically works. The actual gameplay is fantastic. If you don't want a real trading card game experience, then don't buy this game. Be prepared to spend a little more money on it. If not, then go enjoy some Hearthstone, which is also a very good card game.
This game has already impressed me, it has so much depth and strategy and as a former Hearthstone player it just seems so much better.

You need to be aware of the monetisation strategy before you buy though but personally I have no issue with it, especially when it seems like buying cards on the market will be relatively cheap. Completing your collection will be much easier then Hearthstone. I look forward to seeing where the game goes and the potential for future expansion is great.
Awesome card game with great mechanics, every time I lost I felt like it was because of something that I did, not because my opponent got lucky or I got unlucky, etc.

I am loving the draft mode and I can't wait to learn even more about it and get better at drafting and playing.

Well worth the $20, and since I'm mostly playing Draft, I just sold my most pricey rare cards I got out of my packs and made back about ~$15 so far. Since you can play Draft for free, even if I run out of event tickets to play Draft for rewards, I can always just play Casual Draft.

Also looking forward to checking out Constructed! Along with the constructed decks I can make from my own cards, there's a mode to play pre-constructed decks with rare cards against other people.

Why everyone heff to be mad.
Solid card game, more strategic than hearthstone. ONLY DOWNSIDE (other than paying for cards, which isnt terrible in my opinion), is that there is no way to grind for cards or any type of progression that is meaning full and keeps you playing, no monitary gains IE cards or packs. This makes the game dull, however the real excitement for me was creating a deck that i could effectively win with. I recommend the $20 purchase because this is a valve game and you will get your money back on steam, and if it is not for you at least you tried.
Was able to play for a few hours on release night.  Very well designed and intricate card game.

I don't understand the fuss about having to buy cards, it's a trading card game and that's how they work.
A full playset of common cards, can be gotten for about $10 on the market, and uncommons a bit more than that. Rares can be expensive, but the most expensive ones are $10, and you do not need them to stay competitive. This can definitely be an affordable game.
How much do you value your own time? Cheapest card game out there if you do not have unlimited time to grind.

Game is very well presented and offers a unique gameplay experience that feels very rewarding to play. 

Lack of progression hurts the game a little but it won't be much longer until that's out
Don't understand the complaints about monetization, between infinite free drafting and the marketplace this is easily the cheapest online TCG available atm. 

Any game that makes me jump up and yell "eat my ass" at the top of my lungs after a hard won victory is pretty good in my book.
Legit loling at all the "p2w" comments when there are plenty of great free modes to play any card you want.  You can get nearly every card in the game for very cheap.  A lot of fun, a great game in general.
Gameplay:  Overally, really enjoyable.  Like poker and chess had a threesome with Magic: The Gathering.  Really enjoying the free draft mode (where I started) and can see myself spending most of my time there, and in player made tourneys. 

Monetization:  After just 2 keeper drafts and $1.44 spent on the market I have a large collection that I can use to build a ton of fun decks. I don't have every card I want, but for $21.44 total, I have way more than I would have in Hearthstone for most of my first year playing.  For people that never spent a dime in other F2P games this probably isn't the game.  For anyone that hates grinding like it's your job, the pricing is fair.  I expect to spend less than a typical AAA in my first year playing, and you can enjoy the entire set of cards in free draft mode if you never want to spend more than the initial $20.
If you don't want to invest the money to make a SUPER COMPETITIVE EXPERT DECK there are still more than enough balanced and free modes to check out. At launch they have a "call to arms" event with 5 different pre-made decks. These are great as you get to play with cards you don't own with an even playing field (you know...skill). 

The real joy so far has been doing the casual/social tourney's with Phantom Drafting which allows you to break the game in fun ways by getting past some of the restrictions in place and play with tons of cards you won't get to keep, but with oppurtunities to play with them in silly ways.
Extremely good game, haven't found a TCG this deep and engaging since I first started playing Magic: the Gathering beack in the 00s. The UI is snappy and responsive, and being able to choose free draft/constructed/pre-constructed limited gauntlets is worth the $20 price of admission alone.
For years I was looking for a digital card game that would hold my interest, I have tried Hearthstone, Gwent and various other F2P Card games out there.

Artifact got me excited to try it out after reading about the complex way you play with the 3 lanes as well as watching quite a few streamers play in the Closed Beta days before the game launched, it only made me want to really play Artifact.

Concerning the cost to play a lot of people are hesitant to fork over "Tons" of cash just to play normally. Depending on the type of mode you are interested, the game is very cost effective in my opinion. For example I value Draft mode loads more than constructed as I was never great in finding best ways to make a truly winning deck most of the time. With Casual Phantom Draft, I get to play it forever until I either expire or Steam goes under which is very unlikely. Although you do not get rewards in this mode it does not really matter as It is random draft so it does not matter what cards I get from my own personal Booster Packs.

Now for the constructed Argument, even though it will cost you some cash to make the deck you would prefer, pretty much all common and uncommon cards on the steam market is around £0.03 or around £0.10. That makes it very cheap to construct most of the deck you want. When it comes to Heroes that the deck plays around most of the common and uncommon heroes are very cheap as well Between £0.03 and maybe 0.50 if that. With more people putting up their excess heroes and cards in the market all those prices will eventually drop to almost dirt cheap.

All in all either Draft or Constructed I'm sure you will find it enjoyable even with the very little cost to play Artifact.

Update:

As of 20/12/2018, There have been two updates so far;

Last week - They added colour blind mode with suit colours to every card, a leaderboard to the Call to Arms mode which tracks highest stream for each type of deck and added Chat in the form of voice lines to every card as well as making custom messages.

As of 20th - They have no added a Progression system where you can earn upto 15 free packs and some tickets for leveling up as well as profile icons, a Skill rating of sorts that starts at 1 and goes upto 75 depending on your matches as well as Buffs and nerfs to certain cards that people have been concerned over.

Big update from valve before the holidays, much needed changes that I am sure many hesitant to play people will welcome, and I hope they will now give it a try.
I wonderfully deep and fully featured card game. As intimidating as it may look, Artifact is surprisingly easy to start playing, and every turn presents a insane amount of interesting choices. Wins feel well earned, and you truly feel like you're playing against your opponent, while the RNG is determining the situations, not the outcomes. There's quite a bit you get for base price of $20, 2 starter decks, 10 packs (packs contain 12 cards, 1 will always be a hero, 2 will be item cards, 1 rare (which is the highest rarity), 3 uncommon, and 8 commons, with a 5% chance a card is upgraded a rarity), and 5 event tickets, but the real value is that you can play unlimited phantom drafts, for free. To be able to spend $20, and just draft without farming a currency or paying extra is fantastic, also the draft in this game is how I feel it should be play.  Not to mention there are constructed modes, and in-game tournaments (creatable by users) that can have custom rules like pauper (commons only). Finally the market when unlocked on release should make the cost of constucted decks very cheap, allowing you to just buy the cards you need. I'm really happy with this game, though I do look forward to some sort of out of game progression to be added (which has been mentioned as their top priority), but it is definitely worth the $20 price tag, and I see it being my main card game moving forward.
People are frustrated and I can see why but Valve's intent is to make Artifact similar to that of a physical card game where you buy packs and trade cards through market systems/bartering. It's not as pay to win as people say and it's pretty fun. Is it hearthstone worthy? Not sure yet but if you have the wallet to sustain this particular hobby then by all means go for it you won't regret I suppose.
Love the game. Monetization doesnt bother me at all.  Cards are dropping in price like crazy down to the .05 range making this MUCH cheaper than other CCGs that  *FORCE* packs to be the only source. Unless you're one of the 0.001% that was completely F2P in hearthstone, you know damn well you had to buy several packs for legendaries and epics. And being able to sell cards gives you a much better return to buy others, unlike HS dusting where you only retain 25% of a cards value in dust.  I see myself putting a few hundred more hours into this game
I love it. It really felt like a turn-based version of Dota. This is genius design, how the lanes became boards. However... this game is being review bombed because of the card costs, but those people are forgetting one very important factor: the cards are tradeable. Not just for cards, but also for cash!

The crowd isn't always right. There is literally a spending limit because say you have 10 great cards, you can sell them or trade them for cards of similar value. This is miles better than the masked P2W in fartstone. If anything, this game is much cheaper, but people are freaking out because it did not do a good job hiding its cost. Now, this review is not final, I only played 3 hours at the time of writing this. Let's see how things go in a few months.

Finally, I think the game could have launched better if it were F2P with 1 or 2 welcome card packs, with an optional starting bundle for 10. Here's to hoping they consider this, and also consider some form of reward for winning casual games.
great game. there are a lot of different modes and rulesets already built into the game (i.e. pauper, mono color decks only, 4 color decks only, call to arms decks only). in-game custom tournaments, casual and ranked constructed, free phantom draft, bot matches, plus all of the expert modes that have rustled everyone's jimmies.

in addition to the 2 free starter decks they give you, the 10 packs ($20) and 5 tickets ($5) you paid $20 for, the call to arms event provides you with 6 other decks for you to play with. while it would be nice to be able to get cards for free, which is now the precedent set by other card games, there's plenty of other stuff to do without paying a dime for. did i mention there's a free drafting mode?

currently tickets are only sold for $4.95 for 5 of them, but you could buy 20 commons for a nickel a piece and convert that into a single ticket. $0.05 appears to be the lowest price or they'd probably be cheaper
i absolutly love the game. i didn't even open my packs, just played free phatom draft and the game is amazing. i don't care about constructed and free arena mode is all i care about, since I'm not very competitive and don't like playing for money/prize.
the game requires a lot of thinking,strategy and bluffing. lots of fun and for 20 usd I get to play it with all cards as much as I want.
The game's fun, like... insanely fun. When you've got a match where both players are close to winning and your heart pumps super fast, it's great. I've never had a match where one person just stomps the other like in Hearthstone. As you know it's $20 to get in, there is an in game currency but it's only used to buy the "ranked" modes. That being said, you can play the events for free (currently it's a constructed one), you can play constructed for free, and you can draft (like Hearthstone's arena) for free. Currently the only way to get new cards is to pay for them, like your standard physical TCG. Things that are needed are stuff like player trading. Overall, it's very enjoyable and not really pay to win as pretty much everyone has a chance to win. And if you don't want to spend money on packs then just play phantom draft, it's completely free!
Awesome game! Fantastic depth and the most tense ive ever felt playing a game in my life. 

Mechanics
The mechanics are the best in ccg market and make it an incredible game to play, nuff said buy it haha. It is unusual and difficult to grasp at first but that's what makes it so great. 

Looks and feel
 It also looks beautiful and the fact it's set in the dota universe adds so much more to the experience. Fantastic presentation and sound design.

Monetisation
There has been some contriversy as to the monitisation of the game. As someone whos's played thousands of hours of dota and had the experience of playing a fantastic game for free, as well as spending a similar number of hours on ccgs such as hearthstone, I feel like I represent a good middle ground when I say the it's fine. Compared to HS and magic this game is incredibly cheap and given the thousands of hours im likly to spend on it every penny's gonna be worth it. Plus if draft's your thing playing it regularly will cost you practically nothing. In fact if your good, you could well make some money on the market!

Difficulty
If you havnt had experience playing ccgs in the past I would be wary, it's diffucult. I Must have spent 30 hours before release watching guides and pro player, but was rewarded with a perfect 5:0 straight off the bat and that's what makes this game great. It rewards good players and encourages thoughtful play through every move. There's also a lot of great content out there already, enough to get you beating players as soon as you enter the game.

Summary
If you like ccgs or are interested and willing to put in the hours you should definitly get this game. 9/10
Fun, intense, and deep. Not as cheap as other card games, but it really isnt really as expensive as people make it out to be tbh. 

Want more social features like chatting and stuff.
Alot of fun and more complex than hearthstone. Yes, there is RNG but I haven't felt like it was anything that doesn't balance out with good deck building and some understanding of game machanics. With the 20.00$ purchase plus 20.00$ more I have a competitive constructed deck. Thats less then the 50.00$ I usually spend on a Hearthstone release. 

Free phantom drafts and the tournements will also give someone who didn't want to spend more than the orginal 20.00$ to get in. Thats where I see spending most of my time anyways.

I do wish there was some kind of ranked mode though(Draft or Constructed. Preferably one that doesn't cost money to get into. Really surprises me that there isn't.
Artifact has enough depth to be engaging without suffocating players, demanding they commit thousands of nuanced mechanics to memory. You don't have to be a huge Dota 2 nerd to get into it either, though it helped me appreciate all of the sultry VO on them cards. A+ job, Valve and Mr. Richard Garfield!

(I got this game for free for attending The International 2018.)
As a note for any of the people out there saying "Omg this game is all pay2win" "this game is stoopid i want a refund becuz its no fun to have to buy cards" THIS IS NOT HEARTHSTONE. This is not a F2P card game. This is built to utilize the steam market and work like a normal card game. If you dont like it because you need to buy the cards, sorry charlie, reasearch what kind of game you are buying b4 you buy it.
I am enjoying the difficulty, strategy, and opportunities to come back during a match that Artifact offers. I thought playing three lanes of cards would be too much, but it's such a beautifully well thought out playstyle and I did not think I would like it. If you enjoy TCGs like Magic the Gathering, or Hearthstone, than you will enjoy Artifact. There is a learning curve, so do not rush into anything. You will burn yourself out. Play the clock, watch your gold spending, and pocket those big cards for the perfect moment. Patience is key.
I was skeptical of artifact as a result of the monitization scheme.  Many people are making fairly valid claims against the current monetization but I also believe that they are not really looking at the entire picture. Or rather, there seems to be this default idea that you need to own the entire collection to have fun in any card game.  I suspect this mentality came about as a result of Hearthstone where if you do not have a meta deck you get crushed on both of the ranked and casual ladders.

Artifact is not like Hearthstone; if you play with the base game you have access to a much wider variety of game modes; most importantly the phantom draft mode which allows you to select from the entire card pool.  It also seems that like with hearthstone, Valve has plans to keep running "brawl" style game modes like the current pre-constructed mode which allows you to play against other players from a set of preconstructed decks. 

As everyone else agrees almost universally, the game is actually really fun.  The main hangup is the monitization but if you are like me and you don't really care about owning the entire set and just want to play the game casually, then there is more than enough here in the base package to find enjoyment.  Artifact's draft mode reminds me of when I used to play MTG with my friends.  We never had Optimal decks and very rarely did any of my friends or I go out and try to find specific cards to make our decks work.  We play with what we got from the booster packs that we bought and we had all kinds of strange and interesting decks.  

I've played about 4-5 hours thus far and I haven't opened a single pack yet (why would I, I don't know what is strong).  I haven't used a single event ticket either because I want to get a feel for the game and the different cards before I try to play the game competitively.  When I do decide to play the game this way, I might start putting down some money but mostly just to run the competitive draft modes. 

Another thing to note for people complaining about 20 dollar axe cards; these prices on the market have changed drastically over the first 6-7 hours that the game has been live.  Axe costs about 13 dollars right now down from the original 20 dollar amount.  Most of the common cards are going for 0.01 cents (down from .10 cents) and many of the other cards are less then a dollar.  I haven't done any math but from what I saw before, the cost of competing the set would be about 100-130 dollars if I decided to buy everything from the market (and this is with the current prices).  There is absolutely no way that the prices will hold and I guarentee that within a week or two the most expensive cards will be around 4-5 dollars max.       


This is a great game. To hell with all these self-righteous, over entitled babies crying about having to spend real money on cards. Go play something else. This game is not for you. Highly recommended for its depth of play and open market trading.
Artifact is a realistic take from Valve to creating a TCG. Not a CCG, TCG. Trading, Card, Game.

Valve is taking on the shaky grounds of card games by creating value to the cards you acquire by playing "expert modes". They require tickets which after first given 5 tickets require payment.

But there is a reason why this game has to many monetization aspects to it; Because to keep the game's card collection that you own to have ACTUAL value and tradeable, this sort of P2P system is necessary.

What do you expect? Pay 18€ for a game and expect you can start playing for free? CCGs are free because there is the choice to play without paying for anything.

If you already paid for a card game, you'd expect to be spending more for the game - which in return gives more content!

These crying excuses that ripoff knobheads are giving with their Not Recommended reviews are 90% because they expect that after an entry fee to a TCG you could make free profit.

The game is FUN and the monetization seems more fair than what CCGs offer.
Opened 10 packs that Valve gave me with the game, sold expensive cards, opened another 10 with that money. I spent 5€ for 3 packs, got 2 Drow Rangers, sold them, bought another 10 packs, got my Chen that I'll keep for myself, bunch of other cool cheap cards and I got 7 more tickets for events.

10/10 would launder cards again.
Buy a game, open free packs, construct a deck, test it, sell unwanted cards on the market, complete your deck buying cards you need from the market, test a deck in freeplay mode, use free ticket to participate in ranked games, win, get your free packs or ticket (replay button), get good, never spend a dime.

P.S.

MTG: Arena is better. Hearthstone sucks. Shadowverse is a perverted unchristian heresy.
This was worth the wait. Being able to play this game and learning much more than watching other people play it is so great. You may be thinking too yourself "A DCG that cost money!? That's ridiculous and on top of that, the money i have to spend for packs! Greedy devs."  Nah, it's not like and definitely not like other DCG. I can go in-depth on this whole topic but you could look up other reviews. I ain't going full nerd on a fucking review.



Artifact is Game Worth Buying 

First the big issue! it haves flaws for example the P2P model in Ranked mode it would be Okay if atelast 1 ranked mode is free but nope all of the Ranked mode are Pay to Play wich ruins the ranked mode, you can still play for "Free" if you play another game and sell the items to get money for cards and then recycle the cards for the ticket but it is extra work inedeed

still i as a player who loves card games (Not Heartstone) the ability to play DraftMode for Free in casual mode and the Market place for cards makes me happy i don't like to buy Packs of cards to get what i want so im okay with buying the card that i like and be done with it, if you want to have all the cards, sure get the packs if you wish i still belive that the Market is cheaper

im not into Ranked that much soo i would say that it is worth to buy this game only say this if you are going to play it in Casual Draft Mode wich is the best way to play the game and how it was design to be play and since is draft you get to play with cards that you don't own soo no money needed

you can play in construct if you want and build your own deck it is fine as a mode and in this mode you will need to put money to get more cards but honestly this mode is there just because is the standar mode in any card game it aint the focus of this game anyway so.. play is fun but Draft is better

Bots are good and you can make the Deck for the bot to use against you wich make it good if you don't like to play with people or want to test things out 

Finall Note about the P2W """issue""" is the base of any Card Game any card game is Pay to win do you think that you can win with standar cards against a player with a deck already made with much better cards???? in any other card game no you can't in this one... you may have a chance.... a little chance but a chance to win
 no joke there since there are 3 lanes if you play it right and push the enemy heroes in to other lanes leaving that lane to die, you can still win because to move heroes to another lane you need cards or respawn and if they don't have any way to move it... you can win
I felt compelled to write a review because of the HUGE misinformation the negative reviews are providing.

TL;DR If you’re afraid of paying to play the entire game don’t There’s a free draft + free draft with friends (no games do this) 

The negative reviews I’ve even bothered to read are all abounded by one thing: “This game has microtransactions, Valve is greedy, you can’t do anything without paying money, to be competitive you have to shell out tons of money!” But what they all fail to see that, Valve has shifted and created free modes for those exact demographic to enjoy the game. Artifact is a BETTER version than most digital tcg I know of and those who fail to see this don’t understand how AWESOME their approach to digital tcg is. 

You have “try against bot decks” where featured or highlighted mechanics of the latest season are all neatly compiled together for you to test out the latest flavor against bots for free, and then decide if you want to pitch in. You have a casual matches against bots in general. You have a casual constructed play. 

But the two main breadwinners are this: Casual Draft, and Casual Tournament. 

Yes, you read me. A FREE CASUAL DRAFT.

Meaning you will have 100% access to EVERYTHING the game has to offer in this draft mode and UNLIMITED plays versus what Hearthstone or MTG: Arena FORCES you to use a currency to even buy in. Granted you don’t “win” anything but so what? You get to PLAY and that’s what matters. This brings me to Casual Tournament which you might be thinking: “oh so what, I can make a custom tournament whoop-de-hoo I pay 20 USD to play the same deck against my friends.” Yes, you can do constructed but you CAN PLAY CASUAL DRAFT WITH FRIENDS IN A PRIVATE LOBBY NOW. The minimum is 4 and I think it goes to 32 but from my knowledge that’s the FIRST TIME a digital tcg has allowed this, Hearthstone+Magic+Pokemon+Yugioh don’t do this from what I’m aware of. You can FINALLY do a draft/arena styled match against ONLY your friends for FREE as MANY times as you want. Enough freakin’ said.

Sure you pay 20 USD to get in but afterwards you can play unlimited drafts against rando's, and unlimited drafts against friends. Sure you're restricted in construction so in that regard if you like that I would stay away for now until they introduce another way to earn cards outside of steam marketplace. Sure, you don't actually win anything but so what? Most games award you with no real progression but we love them anyway (MOBAs, Rhythm Games, Fighting Games, etc.) and with draft at least you can always access what's new.
Best card game I have played before. Being able to buy the exact card you want on the community market fixes a lot of the issues I had with other card games.
The game is great, I like how it's played, it's given a ton of polish, etc.

The issue is that the only way to get cards is to pay for them. Because of the market, valve doesn't want bots, cheaters, and hackers cheating the system and ruining whole thing.

In it's current state, constructed decks, regardless of casual or expert, is pay to win. Phantom draft is fun, but casual can be exploited into creating some unfair decks. 

The current system is a compromise: "We wanted to try x, and we knew it'd piss people off because it's different and doesn't appeal to the f2p crowd."

At the same time, we have possibly the closet thing to irl trading/selling tcg. It's awesome, but it simply would not succeed with "free" cards flooding the market.
Lots of strategic depth, filled with tons of lore and voice acting regarding the Dota 2 universe.

All in all a really great card game, and I am not just saying this because I was in the beta.  The ability to purchase whatever card you need for your collection from the steam market directly instead of opening a lot of packs is also an added bonus and they mentioned that they would add trading eventually IIRC.
Really fun. Hope I don't get carried away and forgot about work.

A match is about 20-30 minutes average. Obtaining cards from the market is very easy and pretty cheap honestly.
Despite the review bombing that is typical of steam and reddit, this game is actually quite fun. I enjoy the three lanes and tower concept. Yes you do have to buy the game and still purchase more from there but it also uses a community market which is part of the reason its not F2P nor will be in the foreseeable future. I agree with this concept, it does limit the entry consumer a bit but it also allows for more serious play. They even have events where you can play with prebuilt decks free! You never have to spend a dollar beyond and can do this if you want. Whoever compared this to HS transactions is clueless. Hearthstone if jumped into today would run you about 150-200 dollars for a solid deck to compete with. Thats not even top tier.  A proplayer made several decks in here for less than that. Valve has been taking a % since the day the market launched. I dont see a problem with this nor has it been a problem till this game launched. Seems like the haters are going to continue to hate. This game is easy to play alot to master. The  only thing I feel like should be worked on are the % to hit or flip a coin cards like cheat death. There are too many and i understand it adds variety but it also screws over one player massively (hearthstone has the same type of cards.) I will take this over mulligans and mana starvation though. Magic is old and outdated. Its the best game in the card market imo right now.


Added:Casual(Free play) 
Next they are adding: Progression
New generation of card games.
Best gift from Dr. Garfield to Magic the Gathering fans for 25th MTG anniversary.
While Wizards of the Coast / Hasbro are busy creating casual hearthstonish things like MTG Arena; Valve and Dr. Garfield created such masterpiece and new card game for next decades.

Or in the other words, in terms of complexity / strategy:
Magic the Gathering or Hearthstone -> Checkers
Artifact -> Chess
great game so far with a really high skill ceiling. adds a lot of unique mechanics such as gold economy, items and debuffs that allow for some complex and fun plays to be made. i dont like how you cant craft individual cards and have to instead buy them individually because in the end thats kind of like a double-down cash grab where you pay for packs and then pay for the cards you still need as opposed to crafting cards with spares like in hearthstone. you can make pretty powerful decks for cheap though as far as i can tell, most of the cards that cost a lot on the marketplace are more ontrol oriented cards save for axe and drow so its defenitely not a dealbreaker.
I am having a lot of fun. Yes there are issues with the marketplace and with the rewards (or lack thereof) but the game is solid. If you are looking for a card game but not wanting to deal with Hearthstone, I would recommend this game. The game play is solid, the animations are smooth, the music is great, a lot of detail went into the actual game it self.
I've played dota 2 and I've got to say I was a bit disappointed when I learned juggernaut(my dota 2 main) isn't in the game at launch. Also no nightstalker which is disappointing. Other than that got axe in my first ten "free" packs so I've just been stomping my friends in social matches. Solid game, will play more. Also chen seems fun and meepo is in this game so that's a big bonus.
Absolutely the best card game I've ever tried, and I've been making a good one myself a while back.

With 20$ you can play as much draft as you want, no other payments required. You might want to buy boosters or singles for constructed, though, but they look amazingly cheap too. I put extra 10€ this far. I'm going to play constructed for meme decks and weird stuff, and draft seriously.

Just released, I've been playing all night. Bot games, a few casual drafts and a few constructeds with a friend. It has been so fun it's amazing.
I play Hearthstone, MTG, TESL, Duelyst, Gwent, Slay the Spire, Meteorfall, and more. At its core, Artifact is an excellent strategy card game with a lot of depth. By design, the monetization and gameplay are not friendly for casual collectors, so I wouldn't recommend it as someones first TCG. That being said, I've only played a few games of Hearthstone since the new expansion and am constantly thinking about new strategies in Artifact.
This game is great. Only a few plays in so who knows what'll happen as the meta develops, but right now I think this game could dethrone Magic as the true competitive card game. If you like having lots of choices and rarely being at the mercy of topdecks, try it out.
After spending more time with it i'm starting to lean towards not giving a crap about the paywall.  As a card game it's brilliant.  Even cheap/commong cards are very viable. Placement and trying to read your oponent will make far more of a difference than having lot's of rare cards.

I'm going to miss being able to grind forever to get some cards but my time is valuable and when you approach this simply as a digitized physical card game the payment approach starts to make sense. 

I think cheaper packs and a way to earn event tickets through casual play could alieviat a lot of complaints... as you can earn card packs through competitive play via tickets.
It's fun, if you're looking for a refreshing and strategic card game to play casually then go for it.  From what I can tell so far, you don't need to invest much money to have a decent selection of cards.  My first impressions of the card power levels doesn't indicate any sort of Pay2Win, having more and rarer cards just seems like a way to add flavor to your decks rather than a necesarry part of winning.

The competitive modes requiring the paid entry does seem like an odd design choice, but it hardly keeps you from enjoying the casual and social modes.  If you've got some friends to play with I would definitely suggest buying it, however if you're interested in the competitive side of the game, consider the cost of entry (one dollar per-entry ticket) before buying this game or you will be disappointed.
I like when a game is new and the bots are better than humans because none of us know how to play yet. 3 game win streak in the gauntlet event, cant beat the tutorial.
Artifcat is an excellent game that unfortunately has a steep price point. I would suggest looking up the card prices and watching gameplay videos before purchasing this game. With the purchase you should get enough cards to make a deck, but to make a strong (and sometimes even playable) deck requires either buying single cards from the market or opening packs.

Despite this, the gameplay is strong, and I would recommend the game. Just don't expect to be able to freely get every card, one thing Valve should improve with this game is give some alternative way to obtain packs, even if its one pack a week.
Just won an expert constructed draft my first deck I made from the 10 packs they give you for buying the game, two of those games were against decks made with obviously alot of money thrown into them, I'm enjoying this game and finding it very relaxing compared to other card games.
Great game I am very satisfied with my purchase. I don't have time to grind free to play card games. I appreciate I can just buy the cards I need to play a deck. Don't have to deal with cruddy crafting mechanics. Just plain fun like TCG's used to be like.
Fantastically deep card game. Best one on the market. Don't let the traditional monetization or the minor rng scare you. This game is incredibly tactical and strategic, cannot recommend enough.
A fine game that is going to suffer a review bombs because people can't move on from a game released 15 years ago, it won't allow you to grind at a rate of 0,5€/hours and somehow makes people forget how to read.
If you are a fan of really any TCG then you will most likly enjoy Artifact. Lots of customization and little intricate details that will take time to enjoy and also leave you more excited every time you win. You can buy whole packs of 10 cards for a couple of dollars and buy then by the single. There are only a few cards that are pricey at the moment, but I am sure those prices will lower as people discover new strats and the cards become more common. 

***Very important***
Most of the negative comments are either about not getting thier packs when they get the game or the price of cards. They will get thier cards but the server was laggy according to the devs. As far as the paying fore cards, you can get them for free. You start with 5 tickets that can be used for drafts. By winning drafts you earn more tickets and packs of cards. So if you are good then you should have no issue getting cards without having to pay. Also like 90% of the cards are like 0.10 so its not like most of them cost an arm and a leg.
Fantastic game, with a ton of depth.

Don't let the haters fool you.  This is a FAR less expensive game to stay competitive than any of the competitors.  Instead of getting random packs (which you can do if you want, and get more than twice as many cards), you can just flat out buy the cards you want.  Many cost literally a couple of pennies.

I think the hate is coming from Hearthstone fanbois who for whatever reason feel threatened by this game.

$20 for the first 10 packs.  How many packs of the new Hearthstone expansion would I get for free?  Oh that's right NONE AT ALL.
//UPDATE//  
With the new update valve definitely went in the right direction. I'm still not happy with the core system but i can see some progress being made.  
There is a way now to gain packs just by playing, that's great, but you stop getting them after you reach a certain level, so eventually this is gonna become a problem again.  
The major thing is the fact that Valve now will balance cards. No more 15$ card on the market that you have to buy to be competitive.  
Overall the game is MUCH better and as long as they continue to improve upon it, i feel like i can now recommend this game.  
I will update this review if valve fucks it up again.


//OLD REVIEW//
The game presents itself very well until you open the free packs, then you realize that in order to buy a good deck you have to waste 15$ for a single card...but wait, you have time right? surely you can have fun playing while slowly grinding towards some kind of card reward right? nope. NO WAY TO OBTAIN CARDS OTHER THAN $CASH$.  
But hey, you decide to sell your car and get yourself a good deck to play competitive. SURELY THE GAME WONT SUCK ANY MORE MONEY OUT OF YOU, RIGHT!?... be prepared to PAY to partecipate to the competitive games.  
But hey, at least there's a ranking system where i can see how i place myself against everybody right? lol nope.  
This is not a card game. This is a credit card game.  
Oh and by the way, after you realize all this, they won't even refund you because of a tiny easily ignored text they put somewhere when you opened the packs. I feel violated.
It's fun when you know how to play. I leaderd it before buying and it's definitely influenced my experience positively, i imagine it can be frustating if you try it blind and have no experience with card games.

It's will be my main game in 2019 and probably for many years.

Artifact isn't a Digital CCG, it's a Paper TCG that happens to be digital. However, it keeps all the worst parts of digital and ditches the best parts of paper. I recommend it because it's fun, but it's VERY important you realize what you're getting into if you decide to purchase this game.

Graphics + Sound:
The game looks great. Animations are fun, and cards are readable and distinguishable from each other, with great art. The UI, on the other hand, isn't quite perfect. I've always been a fan of the "clean fantasy" UI of Dota2, and this is more of that. However, there's some weird things, like how cards "fall off" to the side when your hand is extra full (it looks terrible, despite being functional), or how you have to double click each time you want to add cards to your deck (rather than double clicking to add 1, triple for 2, etc.). Sounds and music seem good to me, and the voice acting is pretty great.

Gameplay:
Artifact feels like a wonderfully complex game, but it's not terribly difficult to wrap your head around the rules if you've played a TCG in the past. The three lanes make it feel like you're playing 3 games of another TCG at once, where each one can affect each other. Effects that hold over between hero deaths make for interesting strategies, and the randomness of the item shop help make each game feel different.
If the Item Shop and card drawing were the only RNG, I wouldn't have any qualms, but there's RNG all over the place. RNG  if Bounty Hunter gets buffed at the start of a round. RNG if your units will be protected from death by Cheating Death. RNG for how many units Lich's Chain Frost might kill. I was really hoping Valve might see how the negative raction to Hearthstone's heavy RNG cards impacted perception of the game, but I guess they decided "RNG is fun." It's not.
Valve has said they won't be balance changing cards. I feel this is a good thing, because it causes R&D and playtesters to be much more careful about what they pass through, and make bans/restrictions a much more serious issue. However, I can see how you might think the other way, where Valve may play it safe with the power level of their cards, to avoid banning things and tanking the value of a card. It's definitely something to consider when deciding how you might put money into the game.

Progression + Monetization:
Unlike other Digital CCGs (Hearthstone, MTGA, Eternal, Gwent, etc.) there is no way to earn cards and packs for free. No in-game currency, and currently no rewards for free to play formats. This reflects paper TCGs, where the only way to get free cards is to have them given to you by friendly people. But Valve took this a step further by disallowing trading between players, presumably to prevent real money transactions they can't control and earn a profit from. This is possibly the most damning part of Artifact's monetization system. These two factors combined distinguish it from both Digital and Paper CCGs, and make it the most Pay2Win CCG to ever be produced.
Events also follow a Paper CCG format, with any event that has rewards costing event tickets to play. These tickets cost about $1, so the cost is easier to swallow than Paper CCG events (which usually cost $5 to cover the prize pool for a brick & mortar store). Constructed and Phantom Draft events cost 1 ticket each, while Keeper Draft costs 2 tickets and 5 packs. It is theoretically possible to go infinite with these events, by winning and earning some tickets back and making the rest back from packs, but this is highly unlikely, as Expected Value of packs is currently less than $2.
Artifact will have a rotating Standard format, so prices shouldn't get too outlandish if you want to buy full sets to play Standard. A full set of the current set costs around $260 as of writing, which is far from terrible.
For F2Pers, there is challenge (friend) matches, bot matches, PVP matchmaking, and Free Phantom Draft, all without rewards. There is also an event running with premade 2 color decks that is F2P, without rewards. I forsee something like this being the 
 norm. However, the real kicker is community made tournaments, which do not cost event tickets to play. This is where Artifact's real potential can be unlocked, allowing for different custom rulesets like Commons and/or Uncommons only (Pauper), monocolored decks only, 4 color decks only, or event decks only. An organizer could run a free event with prizes (like Steam credit), or you could play an event with your friends, really letting you play how you want to.

So if I have all these negative things to say about the game, why do I recommend it? I don't necessarily recommend it, because each of the parts taken from Digital and Paper CCGs feel a bit halfhearted. Give us a way to earn packs or single cards for free, or give F2P events that give rewards.  However, between the community tournaments, free draft mode, and cheap price of full sets, I can see this being a great game for casuals. If you're a competitive person, I feel this game is significantly cheaper to play than many others, IF you can get over the heavy RNG.

At the end of the day, this brings back feelings of playing Paper Magic, with a seemingly heavy emphasis on draft, and an overlooked emphasis on community events. I look forward to seeing if Valve is willing to fix some of the issues the community has with the game, making it more friendly for casuals looking to get their feet wet in competitive.

Remember: EVERY TCG IS PAY TO WIN.
We now know how many entitled, whiny little pc players can crawl out fo the woodwork.

TL;DR - The Game is excellent. An addictive mix of fun deck building and depth of strategy.
I see people complaining about their card packs, spending money to earn money, and then turning around and complaining about the rng or P2W. Fly you fools!
The games mechanics are excellent, and so refreshing to see the new implemenatation in an age old genre - card games.
With the excellence, intrigue, depth and strategy befitting of the Magic Grand Masters, or the sheer fun of casting cards the likes of Yu Gi Oh's smite, this game has got it all!

Dont listen to the haters. Theyre just here for profits.
Quit pc for once and go play a game with some actual cards.

Good on ya Valve!
My intital review of Artifact was one with much distaste, I had heard about their monetization style and felt it was a bit insane. 20 dollars intitally and then you still had to buy backs? but as I began to play and learn the game I realized it was more like buying a starter pack, a booster set and access to event tickets, just like one might do with a physical card game.

While I still have some disagreements in the game, the lack of a progession system that makes it feel like you're improving and how the card market place is more or less rigged to give valve the most amount of money, the gameplay is actually quite solid.

Certainly pouring money into this game gives access to better cards, which in any other digital card game would make decrees of Pay to Win, the actual price of many good cards, even those that one might say were lesser then other good cards, allows for a good level of play and less of those "he has axe? this game sucks because I have to pay money for axe." many cards feel powerful, with only a few that feel weak (I'm looking at you OD and CM) but it's possible future expansions make give for creedence for such cards, only time will tell.

To end, I enjoy the game greatly and will play a great deal of it, but it definitely needs some work before it can really shine in the future, but Valve is and always has been the company to make things work in the face of adversity, so maybe I should give them a chance? 

As per progression, while it seems that the main way to get more cards shall remain purchasing packs, doing keeper drafts or even browsing the ludicrious marketplace, I still would like some ways to get cards outside of those options, I'm not counting on it but it would certainly take away from the 'pay to win' feel that many cry out against. 

TL;DR I was wrong about the game intially, though I have some reserves, its much better than I thought it was going to be.
This is a ton of fun to play. A lot of haters are crying because they don't like the way it's monetized, but the decks are a lot cheaper than a competitive deck in MTG:O or paper MTG. I guess a lot of people have never played a real card game before! It's definitely not pay to win (like Hearthstone), and the drop rates are much better than other games in the genre. At the end of the day, one card in this game is worth more than every single Hearthstone player's collection combined (since you can't resell HS cards!) 

I see myself playing this a LOT in the future, don't let the naysayers keep you from playing the best digital card game currently on the market.
Well polished and more tactical than other card games and definitely a good game.

Would benefit greatly from Dota's Matchmaking system instead of this whacky monetized system and things like user profiles are jarringly missing.
GGreat game, can stay free after the initial 20$. 
If you want to go more competitive if for you you have to put more money and that's OK.
Amazing mousic and graphics.
I fucking suck at this game coming from casual games like Hearthstone and Gwent. If you are a casual like me then be prepared to get your ass handed to you. Visuallty the game looks amazing. Game feels overwhelming with the decisions you have to make (for me at least). Still trying to learn but it is fun.
Valve delivered a stellar next generation card game and managed to get rid of dailys and mindless grind in the process too. We even have the freedom and choice to buy either packs or single cards off the market, and many cards are dirt cheap (often only 0.05 cent) too. It's too bad that some people prefer Grind Simulator #53465 instead of a proper, polished, and highly enjoyable card game. An absolute recommendation from me: My game of the year so far. To everyone on the brink, I can only say if you enjoy anything related to Artifact: Give it a try, there is no way that you will be disappointed if you give it a fair chance, it blows all the competition out of the water.

Conclusion
The number one choice for Trading Card Games. Grind-addicts must look elsewhere.
Game is great. Very fun and challenging.

I wish the monetization was different. Currently no way to get cards without paying. 

But technically if you are good at the game you can get packs for free forever.
Complex and very enjoyable card game though the games can take quite some time if both players think (which you are supposed to) instead of just spamming  cards like you do in other card games.

Pros:
Built in free draft mode to avoid constant playing against constructed meta decks
Marketplace to bypass RNG packs and get specific cards for fraction of cost of trying to get via packs.
No daily quests, play what you want when you want to.
Players/Community based tournaments
Card game where thinking>cards.  A badly played meta deck will lose to a mediocre deck played well.

Cons:
Must spend money in order to obtain cards which can be sold for money.  This obviously makes sense but many people checking reviews consider it a con so I listed it anyways.
The initial placement.of heros/creeps is uncontrollable RNG (all you can do is select which 3 heros of the 5).  This can lead to some games being in a critically dangerous state before you even got to play a card if you are against red or black.
I've already played 3 hours and I only have positive emotions about the game. All my expectations and time I spent didn't go for nothing. Especially the emotions from the game will be higher if you are a hardcore DotA fan.
the Expensive thing that keeps getting shouted is complety overblown 

There are like 8 cards above the price of a dollar

For instance i spent roughly 15 dollars on top of the 20 and I have at least 75% of the entire collection(with 3x), thats insane consdiring 15 dollars in something like hearthstone or mtga will net me about 10% of a set
IF YOU LIKE CARD GAMES
Then I highly recommend this game to you! To start, the developer is Valve, which means it will be an incredibly polished and highly promoted game that will greatly outlast most of its peers. The community behind the game will be able to count on Steam's resources to congregate and trade not just ideas and strategies but cards as well. For old-school fans of trading/collectible card games, this game being made by freaking Valve is a huge win... that is my opinion, of course.

HOWEVER
There is some controversy about the pricing, and if you were looking to pay competitively FOR PRIZES, then I may have some bad news... it will cost you! Now, remember that you can use >>>ALL<<< the cards in the non-prize modes, but if you want to win prizes then you will have to collect (by any means available) the cards to compose the decks you will use and then use tickets to enter events. Like TF2, basically. (just the ticket aspect, no hatrtifacts) 

THIS ONLY PERTAINS TO PRIZE MODES
Theoretically it could be expensive to max out with the absolute best cards and to play nothing but prize modes all day long. (though by design they cancel each other since the prizes are... ugesdit... tickets and cards) 
This however, is your choice since ALL THE CARDS ARE FREE IN NON-PRIZE MODES

BOTTTOM LINE
20ish dollars gets you an absolutely top notch and unrivaled card game that includes all cards (no grinding/buying) in friendly modes, a market to sell and buy cards (if you wish) and the possibility to dominate the internet with the size of your wallet against other wallet-breathers, but only if you REALLY wish to...
I'm surprised (or maybe not) that most of the negative reviews are based around cost of the game, especially for a TCG. 

Compared to MTGO, cards and events are less expensive. The base game is more expensive but I hardly think a $20 price tag is much to ask for a game with high production value and replayability.

Compared to Hearthstone, packs are cheaper, you get twice as many cards, and you can actually buy and sell cards with other players (what a concept!). That way you don't need to dump stupid amounts of money to build your deck via slot machine.

The gameplay is interesting and thought at much better than I thought at first glance. There is RNG, but it's all pretty low impact. Yeah, several successive unlucky arrows might put you behind, but compared to randomness in the card draw of other games (or the entire game of hearthstone), the game is usually decided based on how well each player plans and adapts to the board. It forces you to think about the macro game, the big picture, which I think is pretty unique for a card game.
Amazing card game but.....
NO matchmaking history
NO Leveling/progress system
NO emotes or ways to interact with opponent
NO replays
NO ways to add opponent after match
NO ways to get free packs
NO incentives to play casual
feels very single playerish at times but is a great game that I hope can add more features as this is VERY barebones atm
TL;DR - It's good and you get your money's value if you focus on draft.

I managed to sell enough of the cards I got at the start to make up for the entire cost of the game with a surplus.

Constructed is out of the question for me, at least for now, but two months from now cards will be very cheap to buy so a meta deck will be easy to construct and in most cases a lot cheaper than any other card game
You will never know the consequence untill the very very last second
breathtaking-10/10


However
1.unblance cards
2.20-30 minutes per game
3.you need trickets in order to continue playing(ticket to arena to win)

Still I think I had a good time cuz I got axe and dark ranger from 10 starter packs
*All of the complaints in my previous review of the game have been adressed and now I'm updating it to positive.*

Game is fun to play, has deep strategy, and your choices really do matter. There's some degenerate decks (Looking at you Blue/Green combo) but what ccg doesn't have a few degenerate decks. 

Only complaint I have left is that games are really long for a card game. We're talking 20-30 minutes long. 

Anyway, if you have the time to play a ccg I highly recommend this one. It has some of the best core mechanics of any ccg on the market.
Excellent game so far , Causes me to think, i love thinking! And i love to win when the game is good and fair...

There is an RNG element but (at the moment) , not so bad.
This game breathes new life into the TCG genre. Steam cleverly utilizes it's long time intergrated market to make it simple to sell and trade cards, making it beyond easy to get access to cards you need- to build your ideal constructed deck. This is not seen in most online card games, sans MTGO. So I applaud Valve for having an open market on release. So those who complain that the entry price is steep in addition to needing to purchase packs are just being silly. For your $20 you get 10 packs, two intro decks, 5 tix  and some DOTA subscription if you care about that. Honestly, its pretty fair initial entry pricing for a typical TCG. The presentation is great. So stylistic and cheery. The concepts introduced are interesting and could be considered a great evolution to the hearthstone formula. You get plenty avenues of approach to defeating your opponet, more than I've seen in any other card game appart from MTG and I'm very impressed with mechanics and design ideas they've established. There is incredible ground work for future expansions and I can see this TCG being a long term investment for a lot of players, such as my self.
I got this game for free because of Ti8 attendance. If you like dota, you might enjoy this card game. The gameplan could be fun, but you have to spend money. I have no plan to play it competitvely,  only play bot game for relaxing
Pros:
+ Great game
+ Option to buy single cards via market place
+ Valve game

Cons:
- 10% + 5% tax on market place transactions. C'mon valve.
- No p2p trading
( - No free2play way at all for people who want to grind instead)

Still overall a great game with an even greater future. 


Simple rules but incredibly complicated with all the depth you would expect from Richard Garfield. Absolutely love the game. It's monetized like a TCG and that is fine. If you have played MTG, pokemon, or any other TCG it's a lot like that. Only real negative is that there is no trading with friends.
Enjoyable gameplay.   Reasonable monetization model.  Plenty of modes to play for free.  Marketplace makes it affordable and easy to complete decks.  Tournament modes are excellent for playing with friends.
Really well designed, the servers tended to crash a lot on first release but it's better now. 
For those crying that it's pay-to-play, what the heck? The majority of card games are. And if it's Free-to-play and a card game then expect it to take ages to simply get a handful of decent to good tiered cards. 

If you like strategy and being able to win with any deck and strategy this is for you.
If you like being topdecked and countered at literally every single card you play and/or either steamrolling opponents with decks that you either grinded for years of play or bought loads of packs just to get a single card you want then play Hearthstone. It's "free".
This is a fun, complex game with a lot of depth. I appreciate being able to buy singles instead of being forced to get cards via lootboxes. Lots of ways to play for free as well.

Cons:
Games are a little long
Yeah, the payment model is almost a crime, but all TCG are pay-to-win by nature...

the fact that you can cash out some of your investments in cards via the steam market offsets the fact that you can't progress without buying additional packs...

and if you're really good at this game, you can virtually buy any game in steam....
Dota but in a BRILLIANT card game. Don't listen to all the haters writing reviews calling it pay to win, it's not, those bitches just want everything for free. Game is great, like MTG, deep and intricate and complex like dota. If you like card games that take lots of thought and planning, this is the one.
Having played MTG, Hearthstone and Shadowverse extensively I can safely say that Artifact is one of my favorite card games now. The fact that for 20 bucks you can play the phantom draft mode is enough for me as draft has always been the most balanced way to play card games like this. 

I love the new three lane mechanic and the shop mechanic. Its charming how well they translated Dota2's feel into a card game. 

The nuances that these mechanics add coupled with how turns work leaves tons of room for creative play that bring back the style of the "stack"mechanic in MTG. Hearthstone and SV never satisfied the itch that magic did with the ability to cast instants in the middle of your opponents turns ("Secrets" would be the closest thing to being able to react to an opponents spells prior to the attack phase but is just preemtive). 

The turn phase that happens between both players before attack phase brings back that feeling of being able to actively counter or defened something before attack phase happens and I personlly love this about the game.

Im glad they went this direction as it adds more room for craestive spells and mechanics in the furture. 

anyways. 10/10

I probably wont play any other card game ever again. 



10/10
Hey, I have a problem, the game did not start on macbook. I have the error: "Unable to Start Game. Failed to initialize Vulkan. Please make sure your driver and GPU support Vulkan"
I can't reccomend this game strongly enough.  If you like deeply strategic head to head play, this is the best card for that I have ever played.  I started on Magic a bout a year after it's release, and played a number of the ccgs.  The only real stand outs back then were netrunner and Jyhad (later renamed V:tES).  More centrly I have truied Hearthstone, and both versions of stand alone Gwent, as well as most of the FFG Living Card Game style games.  And I was a comeptetitive D&D Minis player for a few years, makig it to top 8 before winding down from that scene.  

There are plenty of reviews so I won't deep dive on the mechanics, you can get that content all over the place.  But I will speak to the monetization debate.  There is a lot of disinformation and entitled complaining happening, often the later as a result of the former.  

Once you pay the entry fee of $20, there is a ton of content available for no addiional cost.  Draft Guantlet for example, can be played for free an unlimited number of times.  It is all I have played so far, and I am having a blast.  There is also the pre-constructd launch event that allows playing with all sorts of cards across the set.  I could go on, but the link below goes into these issues in more detail.  So, I'll leave the curious to further investigate as you will.  

I hoe this was helpful!

If you're a fan of TCG's such as MTG, you're going to enjoy the game. Especially if you're also a fan of Dota. Like MTG it is gonna cost some money to own an entire set, which is why a good amount of people will dislike this game. That's completely fine, not every game is F2P and caters to those with limited income. If you are fine with that, you probably already know you don't need to open packs (always the most expensive and worst idea). You can get loads of cards for cheap and I imagine that will always be the case after the market is given time to stablize after a release. All of the current hate is due to non TCG players and a lack of progression system (which in my opinion is fair, however it was announced for the future). 

TLDR: If you aren't dirt poor and have played TCG's before you're going to enjoy this game.
Loving the game so much, but it has cons aswell, beware, some of them will be adressed.

Pros:
- Unique Deisgn
- Lots of Voice Lines
- It's simple to play  (seriously, it's not as complicated as it looks like)
- There's events in which you can play with specific decks 
that include cards that you don't own, in public match

Cons:
- Everything cool is pay to play
- There's no Progression (however there will be in future)
- There's no Rewards for anything (theye may be drops in future
according to Reddit leak)
- Sometimes games last too long
- Axe OP
Not sure why so many negative reviews. The game is a ton of fun at least from what I saw. No issue getting my 10 free packs. I've played 2 games of the featured mode and won both but they were quiet close and competitive!  I don't know why anyone is surprised by the microtransactions. You people spend $100s in Hearthstone and other things in real life and you scoff at $1.99 for a card pack? Great game! Looking forward  to seeing more!
Addicting and high quality TCG, 
Prices are only gonna drop with time don't listen to the HL3 hate, 
totally worth a shot even for a non card player like me.
Two hours in, I'm definitely hooked.
Great card game with lots of depth and plays like no other card game in the market right now.
Animations are smooth, UI is beautiful. Can't wait to get better at it!
This is a fun card game. The negative reviews are all by kids that have barely any hours played and read an article telling them they couldn't afford to play it. Don't listen to the cryhards you can play this game and have fun for just the base price. If you want to play competitive yes you will have to spend money.
I've been playing this game since the beta, and I have to say it's really enjoyable. This is the brainchild of Richard Garfield, the creator of modern/hobbyist card games, and it is significantly better than Magic: The Gathering, but I'm not sure if it's as good as Netrunner.

If you're a card game afficianado, should you give it a try? Yes, almost certainly. It has a very high skill-ceiling, and most games that you lose, you will be able to look back at and figure out something that you could have done differently to prevent your loss.

If you don't play many card games, should you give it a try? Maybe. While it has significantly less RNG than the two big card games (MTG and Hearthstone), there is definitely still a decent amount of RNG there. Some matches WILL be decided by luck. It's up to you whether you're willing to put up with that.
Really enjoying it so far. 

Tonnes of fun, they give some good starter decks to try out and the free modes are all I've used for the past 3 hours and I feel like I haven't scratched the surface.


Thought I would edit this with my updated playtime. My only gripes as I played through were the lack of progression and broken cards which ruined the economy (some cards were horrendously expensive and in draft people used these). Valve has now either fixed these issues via updats or have changed their stance and are fixing 'broken' effects and adding cool effects to cards (such as Quicken)

I feel a lot of the negative reviews are outdated so thought I would do my part in bringing this game to the rating it deserves. (CERTAINLY is no longer deserving of the 52% rating). Would urge any new viewers of the store page to check any dates of reviews and trust more in those posted (or edited) after the 20th December (Latest update)
Pros: 
*amazing sfx
*lots of lore
*very satisfying gameplay

Cons: 
*reviews from half life fans who gave 20$ to valve just to leave a negative review.
Gameplay is very engaging, I've had some amazingly close games so far. I feel I'm really in control of if you win or lose, there's incredibly low RNG compared to other card games.
This is overall a relly fun game. Its depth in gameplay is just amazing. Everyone searching for a new challenging card game might find their new favorite game with Artifact.
Edit: Enjoying it a bit more now knowing I have something to work towards and that there are ways to earn packs and tickets. Recommending it if you enjoy TCGs that are very deep and take time to master.

Having fun but just now realizing there's no way to earn any rewards for battling bots nor playing with others unless you use tickets and even then you have to win enough to earn them. There is no progression nor any reason to play unless you have the tickets and the money to shell out, and even then your just working towards more tickets and packs. It's sad because I am enjoying the game but I'm confused as to what's going to keep me playing. Give us something to work towards other than continually getting and selling new cards.

On a positive note, this is one of the most enjoyable TCGs I've played in awhile. I wish there was an in between yes/no.
Opening statement: Artifact is an amazing game already from the tutorial to playing with friends if you like card games you will love Artifact.

Cards: Obtaining cards costs money but you can get them from the Draft mode like, to enter Draft you will need an event tickets which you can either buy with real money or scrap 20 useless cards to get one, doing Draft lets you gain more event tickets or even packs if you win but if you lose many times you won't get much.

Every card you get from packs can be sold on the market like CSGO skins but hopefully much less expensive since you get the highest rarity card in each pack, steam of course takes a cut which I personally think should be lower but it most likely won't happen, anyway you can buy singles from other players to complete your deck instead of having to spend £100+ on packs if you are unlucky which is always a plus.

Gameplay: Artifact has so many mechanics that some player might find overwhelming at first however it does get easier when you begin you understand everything, the complexity comes in the form of knowing how or when to play cards in many different situations

Finishing words: Artifact may be considered by many to be one of the best online card games out there however it is not without its problems, most people are upset by the way Valve is marketing the game and an upset community can die out fast, only time will tell but if you love the game then stick with it.
Beta Review

A pretty fun card game overall but it has some pretty hit or miss aspects with RNG.

So to start off you have 5 heroes, 3 that are deployed on round 1, and another 2 which are deployed on rounds 2 and 3 respectively. The problems lie in the fact that:

1. Hero spawns are completely random. You do not get to choose which lanes your heroes go to(for the first round). You DO get to choose who you send out first but the lack of hero control at start can make or break a game but this can be a nonfactor if you plan ahead.
2. Creep spawns are completely random. You dont want to send two creeps to the mid lane leaving your hero top to die? TOO BAD! The hero spawns could be completely ignored if creep spawns weren't so ass at times and a lot of times if your card is not tanky enough (that is at least 7 hp or at least 1 armor at the start) your hero will die on round 1 and the lane will be a very hard battle to win. Red heroes will always have the advantage in the early rounds because they're the only ones that can survive Round 1 almost everytime. This is not to say there is anything wrong with this, the pros of a Red deck are how strong you are early and the cons of other colored decks are how weak your heroes usually end up being, this all just really goes back to Creep Spawns and not being able to protect your heroes because you were given no creeps bot for your Drow vs an Axe. 

This was a major complaint among some of my friends when playing the game along with creeps drawing random aggro from 3 units one turn which can make or break a victory (again, shit spawns causing shit aggro causing an infuriating situation where you either have the cards you need to change the aggro or have just been royally fucked by RNGesus himself.)

The game itself has no insentivizers for you to keep playing it. There is no big reward for winning games outside of Expert Play, no ranked mode, no real goal. I don't see any reason for people to keep playing. Heck, the only reason I keep playing it is that it is a nice pass time for waiting on friends to play Dota with, or taking a short break from Dota. Addiotionally, it is nice that I can play this on my laptop so I have something to do for fun during some off time between classes. 

The game felt pretty fun during the beta, trying out various new decks and strageties is always a fun thing for me but when I'm met with the same Axe, Ursa, PA, with the occasional Drow Ranger, strat I can't help but feel like the meta is already stale. With all that said, I hope that the Game Launch will revitlize the meta and bring in more things like silly builds and more hero picks outside of the current and because of that I am hopeful for the games future, especially with Valve at the helm, and am very optimistic about this games future.

fixed the glitch so i got my packs, the gameplay is great and very fun as well as strategic, monetization for cards keeps going down most cost less than 20 cents.
So I will say this first. The game is great. As someone who comes from playing Magic IRL and Magic Arena/Hearthstone this game is fresh of breath air. The Monotization is hardly a problem it just follows a TCG way of doing things instead of the CCG way of doing things, so this will never be a valid argument in my opinion. Everything is done well from voice lines, animations, art, etc. The only truly negative thing i can say about the game right now is I haven't received my free 10 packs, event tickets and starter decks. Other then that i have zero problems. Ill just play Phantom Draft.
Created by Richard Garfield, Artifact offers a depth of play hitherto undreamt of. For your initial $20 purchase, you recieve access to the rotating, pre-constructed deck format alongside free global matchmaking and casual constructed and draft gauntlets at no extra cost. You can participate in paid versions of the two formats, Constructed and Drafted, for a nominal free of 1-2$ in tickets with the oppurtunity to win prizes and recoup your entry fee should you finish with a positive win ratio.

The gameplay is stunning, and I often find myself looking back on a match knowing that there was some line of play across Artifact's three lanes that I could have done better. RNG in this game is designed to be mitigated by cards, and I have never felt that I lost a game because of the roll of the dice. The three lanes mean that you will find that most players when presented with a board state, will often end up in different unique situtations as opposed to linear one lane games. The style execution of the game is outstanding - with an immense wealth of voice lines and character interactions. Artifact expands on the existing lore of the Dota 2 universe, using card lore, voices and comics to tell the story.

I would highly recommend this game to any card game enthusiasts that are looking for a digital card game to play.

In terms of economy, the market prices have been rapidly dropping since release and it seems that acquiring a full set of cards will easily be less than what it would cost in Hearthstone through the Steam Community Market. Even without using the market, one of Artifact's core modes, Draft, can be played completely free.


Hands down best card game I've ever played.
Lots of strategic depth. 
Free drafts and prizes for 4wins in $1 draft. Sell rare cards and buy steam games with them.  What other game let's you do that?
While basic on overall niceties at the moment, Artifact is a great card game that sets itself apart through a number of interesting, deep mechanics that speak to me much more than its competitors. The buy-in price is easily worth it given the bevy of game modes that can be played going forward forever for free (and give access to new sets of cards, without having to buy in). The lack of grinding associated with F2P stuff makes each match more meaningful to me. Lots of great social options for playing with friends also makes this feel more like when I used to play Magic all night at a friend's house than any other digital card game. It's good!
The deepest and most polished card game in modern memory. IT IS NOT EXPENSIVE, don't believe the lies. Many rares can be found on the market for <50 cents. With only 3 rarities and only 1 hero needed, it is very easy to obtain top tier cards cheap. 

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  A+
Enjoying the game so far. Market will take a few days to settle, but it's a huge plus to be able to price decks out and not have to grind for hours and gamble on packs to build the deck your looking forward to.
Very fun game, casual draft is free to play. LAN modes are fun, ranked is potentially expencive though. Valve are great at updtes and patches so I am optimistic for the future
Simply the Dota of card games.
Polished game, complex, great outplay potential. Most likely going to become a great esport.
Free draft wich is pretty much neat.
it also has a good tutorial (unlike dota), and is deep in lore. Also have great visual and sound effects.
There will be people that will not like the game just because its not HL3 or bcs they have to pay 20$ to play it, but for me atleast i like it and most likely continue playing it for the 5 years to come !
Superb game, a lot of fun, it is not p2w as people mention it, just won the draft 5/1 got 2 packs for free and a new entry, once you get used to the game and you understand the mechanics and farm/grind should be fairly easy

Also the cards for constructed ( hoping thats the way this game is gonna go with the tournaments/ranking system ) are fairly cheap and easy to get

I rate this game a 9/10
As someone who's invested a good portion of their life into MTG, Hearthstone and other TCGs I can say that this. Is. Unique. Determining how good it actually is will take a matter of time. The formula is very interesting and leads to different games every match and since there is no established meta currently you can play how you want and enjoy it. The cons from what I can see? Getting packs seems far too difficult, I had assumed since it had a 40$ price tag that obtaining packs would be far easier. Of course people will cry "pay to win" but I think that with the addition of marketplace and steam trading of cards the economy for cards will be very fair. Some cards may end up being incredibly expensive or difficult to obtain from packs once "gems" are discovered. But for now, I take the game as it is. A very very fun alternative to MTG or Hearthstone.
Best card game since Yu-Gi-Oh.

The game is anti-gatekeeping which seems to make fans of some cards games upset. In this game you can be completely new and have the same competetive deck a person that played 100 hours would have, by spending $30 or less. Do that in any other card game... You start playing Gwent and find out you like it. But you need cards to be competitive and the ONLY way to get them is buy packs and hope to RNGesus. Or use scraps which can be farmed over a few hours every day. After a few months I would have the card I needed to be competitive but... I've already moved on to other games that don't want to keep me staring at the pay gate while people say these card games are 'Free to play'.

Also I'm guessing a lot less kids will play this seeing as it costs money and requires skill instead of being able to buy 100 packs with your parents CC.
A lil money for a epic card game, worth it.

tho if theres no achievements and progress added in, the game will lose decent amount of players.achievements and progress always get gamer hook on one game. plz notice mem valve
Way better than Hearthstone, better mechanics, better gameplay, etc. 
If you are looking for a similar hearthstone experience this game is not for you.
The monetization is actually better than expected it to be. The game can be played even without paying with casual draft. The only cons I see if when you try and go play competitive you will need cash to play competitve constructed. Other than that this game is so good.

Patch 1.2
The game is much better now after giving rewards. They have now a progression system and a way to give tickets and packs. For the time being let's hope for more to come. I feel like the game needs more. Overall good changes. 

EDIT: 

After playing the game for almost 2 weeks now I realize that this game reward good players. By winning alot of expert play you can actually make it almost free to play by recycling the cards that you have won or selling cards then buying low cost cards to recycle. 

The game revolves around the community tournaments which you can earn real money or steam wallet.

(outdated)
TLDR: Reward good players. Not casual friendly. Needs to have 1 free ticket every week.

Cons:
Artifact is not casual friendly but you can still enjoy the Casual Play and Draft.
Not much real in-game goals like MMR or archievements only perfect runs, but still meh.
Constructed Play is almost impossible to play without paying money.

Pros:
This game rewards "Really Good Players". 
Hardcore card gamers will really enjoy this game. 
Community tournaments are extremely fun and rewarding.
You can earn money by being "Too Good."
The monetization model is not bad as people say it to be. But we need to have free ticket every week.
I enjoy this game a lot and recommend it. It does come with an economic model that many people will debate. That said, I'm sure I'll get enough time and enjoyment out of this to think it is worth it. Cheaper than an older card game, less gambling and required grind than the new ones. Buy it and play free phantom draft. You'll easily get your money's worth.
Collectible card games aren’t just for hobby shops anymore. Now, you can play with your friends on your PC or mobile device from almost anywhere. And with card games  having gone digital, you can undertake solo adventures with the same intricate rules and endless variety as their physical counterparts. Whether you want to hone your card game skills or try something totally new, check out the best card game in the digital space.
The Game is great! I am really enjoying the free draft mode. The 3 lane system and passing 'initiative' allows you to play your strategy how you want it and it makes up for a different game most of the time, but i noticed already that in many games one lane gets abandoned by players and almost everyone focuses on two lanes instead! 
The game offers many different cards with its first set which allows you to build many different deck Archetypes. 

Te only part i don't like in Artifact is the fact that there are currently no free rewards, so i can't grind for anything new and the only option to aquire new cards is to pay, hopefully this will be changed in the future maybe include something like the one free entry tournaments with milestone rewards like we have in Clash Royale.
Great game despite people whining about it not being F2P and letting them grind cards for pennies an hour at a real job.
If you like drafting, you can draft forever completely free. If you like constructed you'll need to shell out a bit of money for a few decks but most cards are dirt cheap.


Fact is that even though you NEED to buy cards (if you are playing constructed), this game is much cheaper on average for a competitive player than games like MTGA or Hearthstone where you can kiss 500+ dollars goodbye to build a true tier 1 deck.
One of the different Card Game ever -..- This is MMO BATTLE CARD GAME??!

BTW to be honestly I love the IDEA of this game that you need to control many things in single game to win BUT I feel it too long for card game I mean Look you need to play around 20-25 min for one match?? 

HELLO WE PLAY CARD GAME NOT A BOARD GAME DUDEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
I only played the 2 tutorial "missions" and (opened the packs) so far looks good... 

pros:
- sounds and effects of cards and round animations look good.
- runs good, way better than hearthstone
- seems to have enough depth at first sight.
- easy to grasp on the basics like placing your heroes in the start or what to buy in the shop at the end of the turn etc.
- u can play draft endlessly without further spending cash if u r into that.
- u can sell your cards for steam bucks on the steam market and there is an ingame version of it oo.

cons:
- the said ingame market which wont let you set the price of the cards.
- as of yet, no way to earn new packs or cards for just playing, without submitting tickets (u only get 5 of it, included)
- where your heroes and creeps attack are rng controlled (but can be modified by spells n such).
- games take too long. i completed the tutorial missiond which are basically 2 matches against bots in almost an hour. thats too long for 2 games, and i only played against bots who dont think just act.
- i didnt notice a rank system or whatsoever for competitive play when i was tinkering in the menus.
- the price which is basically the price of the 10 packs u get (17.50euros) plus 1 euro. i can see the deal valve thought they were giving customers though because out of the 5 (1 euro/each) tickets u get 4 is basically free but come on...
- oh and u basically loose your right for refund if u open the 10 packs u get for the purchase.

overall i wont say that this game aint worth the purchase just that you wait until it gets the polishing it needs.
I've played almost every online CCG prior to Artifact and I have to say after several hours of playing it, I'm just not into it. If it had any sort of f2p economy I might load it up every now and then and eventually get into it, but after doing a few free phantom drafts and then my two only keeper drafts possible (can't keep more than one hero from each pack which I find ridiculous when trying to build a collection) from the 10 packs and 5 tickets they gave you I just can't see myself dropping money to play this game.

EDIT: I decided to give the game another shot. Rather than paying more money to draft again I decided I'd use the cards I got so far to create a constructed deck and see how that went. I was lucky enough to pick up both Axe and Lich in draft so making a semi aggresive RB deck wasn't tough. After a few matches I tuned it a little bit, added Blue for Zues and went 5/1 in Casual Constructed. Dropped 10 more dollars in the market to round out my item shop and tune the deck some more and I have a competitive deck (in casual at least). Will have to see how that works in Expert. 

The game definitely has a steep learning curve, even for veterans of CCG games as the mechanics are vastly different. If you can get past the P2P economy and enjoy constructed it could be a lot of fun. Draft economy definitely needs a fix as it's pretty ridiculous you can't go infinite, even with a perfect record.
Game is super solid. If you believe otherwise I'd advise giving a closer look to the core design concepts (especially initiative). Most reviews are upset about the cost of entry, I'd advise checking the market in a week from now if it's something you dislike. Just know that the most expensive card is hovering around 10 dollars (and going down) and draft is playble for free.
Game is a great example of a modern and competitve TCG done right. The economy component makes it feel like a proper TCG, the game has complex and rewarding mechanics, and overall probably the best card game out on the market. People are salty because it isn't F2P but neither is Magic, Yugioh, or Pokemon TCG
Only done one match, gota say it was close and scary already a great game. Could even tell the guys bought a couple of packs vs my customs starting pack, not going to be a pay to win at all. xd
There's a great game here buried under a mountain of idiots who refuse to spend about 20 minutes having a strategic match up and / or won't pay ~$50 for a full game experience.
Plenty of outraged people are mad about a card game that costs money (aka every card game ever made). Great atmostphere and great gameplay with minimal amounts of RNG.
Prety good p2p(pay to play) game. Lets compare draft and costructed

draft 10/10 - main game mode, can be played for free

costructed 7/10 - can buy cheap t3 deck right now (2$) and more expensive t2 deck after some grind

https://www.artifactfire.com/artifact/deck/kozmic-black-7086 10$ and few cheap budget https://www.artifactfire.com/artifact/deck/ramp-green-budget-by-fesor-1-2-9659 2.5$ https://www.artifactfire.com/artifact/deck/icys-rb-aggro-1-0-budget-2-10284 2$
I was upset earlier cuz I didn't get my free packs but I got them now!
Only played 2 games so far but I can already tell this is the best strategy game ever made.
If you are low IQ i guess you won't like it because it takes a lot of fast thinking.
So just go back to your trash console ports like fallout 76 or battlefield or whatever crap game you like.

This is the best videogame released in the past 5 years at least. First time in a long time a company dared make a game for high IQ individuals and didn't casualize the gameplay to make it fun for a broader audience.
People just wait for the release, so they can put up a bad review. Wow. Just play the game, give it a chance, and then decide if it's good or bad. Don't be so biased, because of a market/p2w/notfreestuff. It's a fresh game in the genre. Give it a shot, for me it looks interesting. Nothing spectacular to say "WOW", but you have to think what you play and how you do it, you get rewarded for some of your plays, and it's really satisfying when you get a free pack from just being good (or lucky, as always) in a draft. I'll try it some more and edin this later on. Cheers !

EDIT : Played some, it's really competitive and it's satisfying when you win, i like it. Overall it's a good game and has a potencial. 

About the money - If you ignore the fact that some cards cost a lot (for now), for, maybe like 10 euro, you can buy many and decent cards for many different archetypes and decks, so youcan have fun, the cards are easy to get from the market, and if you feel lucky, you can try opening a pack or two, so you can get something good, or sell stuff, to by other things, it worked for me so far. It's not a game that you gave to spend hundreds of dollars.
Complicated, fun, cheap (if you're smart about it), gorgeous looking and it's set in a cool universe, if you've read this far buy the game! and if you already have the game? Buy it for a friend!
Now that the game has been out for a few weeks and I've had a chance to properly play, I'll sum it up in the most neutral, unbiased way I can.

[u]Game design[/u]
To start with the game design, the design is really really stunning. The graphics are very well done, and the animations are amazing looking. This does give a very interactive gameplay feel, and is far superior to basically all other CCGs out there.

This is really the only solidly perfected thing about the game at this early stage. The game has real potential if it could just be more finely tuned. I'll explain these below.

[u]Meta[/u]
The constructed meta of the game is extremely boring at this stage. You basically have a 50% chance of matching vs. OP heroes: Axe, Drow etc. which are all $10+ on the market. In the early development stages, Valve exaggerated their goal of this not being another pay-to-win game, and it certainly seems the complete opposite at this point.

I'm not just giving off about it being pay to win because I don't have the money, I had almost every card in the game including Axe, Drow, Kanna etc. however I've sold them all. I feel that the experience of winning against someone with less valuable cards is extremely unsatisfying. I want to win because of skill and strategy, not by spending extortionate amounts of money on cards to get a clearly obvious mega advantage. Also Valve, stop calling it a Trading Card Game, that literally means you trade your cards with other people, not trade your money for a card with a 15% Valve tax.

I 100% recommend playing draft only at this point. It's super fun, as you come across a huge variety of decks, and if someone has an OP card or hero, you can respect their luck for hitting it in a draft, rather than being annoyed you're getting beat because someone spent more money than you, like in constructed.

[u]Social[/u]
I am writing this before chat is available in the game, however chat update is apparently coming in tonight's update. I think releasing the full release of the game before this feature was a thing was a slight mistake.

[u]Progression[/u]
As of now, there is absolutely no ranking system in the game at all. This is the biggest downfall, and the one that's getting the most attention at the minute. I'll not go too in-depth, because I'm guessing this is a feature that will be added very soon, but as with my last point, it's a shame this is meant to be a full release without such a core feature.

[u]RNG[/u]
A lot of people are complaining about the RNG nature of the game. I must say I don't feel RNG affecting the outcome of anywhere near as many games as people try to make out. Cheating Death is the only really messed up card I can think of, and I think the game would benefit from a mulligan at the start of the game, and possibly some freedom with unit placements.

[u]Monetization[/u]
The game is very rapidly losing players daily. In my opinion, I do not understand whatsoever the monetization of the game. Valve tried to say the game wasn't free to play because they didn't want it to be pay to win like other CCGs, but then they made it $20 PLUS we're expected to spend $100+ to get a decent competitive deck.

Valve will inevitably make this game free to play, but they need to act very fast. The business model of games heavy on microtransactions is about getting players into a game easily, where they then feel pressured to spend money to get boosters faster than working for them. With a high price tag, people cannot just casually download the game and see how they feel about it, they must commit to that purchase, which is why this game will never ever kick off to Hearthstone's level of popularity without it being free to play.

To sum all up, the game is good, and I can see it going far provided Valve adjust these areas of the game based on the complaints from the community. They certainly do seem to be listening to community feedback on this game, but probably only because they've seen the numbers and realised something has gone badly wrong.
I can say I'm pretty happy with the game right now. Since the first update almost every problem I had with Artifact is gone (specially considering I only play Casual Phantom Draft), and the only thing I think the game lacks right now is some kind of progression (and Valve is already working on it). In the end, I only have around 10 hours of gameplay, but I believe the game is in a very good state.
Game runs fine and the gameplay is engaging from the few games I played.

Can't recommend for people on low-spec computers as the game will run like ass otherwise..
Artifact is a very engaging card game, one that I'm glad has made it's way into my account from attending The International 8 for Dota 2. Also a very nice game to play while queueing for a dota game. That's mostly what I use it for.
This game is amazing. Seriously, for $20 you can get unlimited amount of gameplay in free constructed & draft game modes. You can also sell your cards on the market and possibly even make (Steam) money in the long run if you're good at the game. 
10/10 Valve, was worth [strike]buying[/strike] dancing like a monkey!
[h1]Valve got greedy.[/h1]
  Apparently Valve forgot everything they learned from TF2, CS:GO and Dota2. Making fun games fully accessible to everyone. Online games without players and communities are destined to fail.
[b]But... Nope.[/b] Valve decides to exclude 90% of the World.
[list]
[*] Pay for the game.
[*] Pay for cards to play the game, making the best cards the rarest and therefore most expensive. (when they said power level wouldn't be related to rarity)
[*] Pay to enter prize modes.
[*] Take a % cut of prize mode entry fees.
[*] Make a Trading Card Game where you can't trade. You can only buy and sell on their market, while taking a 15%+ cut. Sell a card for $0.03, get $0.01.
[*] Slowly inject cards behind a weekly time-gate to ensure the market decays, making it impossible to break even in prize modes.
[/list]

There's so many things they could charge for that don't affect gameplay. People love hats.
Why not charge for: different imps, hats for imps, different card fronts/backs, different boards, animations, dyes for cosmetics and features (river color), props like trees/flowers/dota2 heroes to decorate/place and make unique boards, chatwheels, emotes, and everything else you did in your other successful games.

[h1]The game isn't fun.[/h1]
This is supposed to be the best card game possible? They had complete design freedom to do anything they wanted on a digital only platform with a 3D game engine. And they made 3D versions of 2D cards with static art... They literally have 3D models, animations, and cosmetic systems to work with for every hero from Dota 2.

The gameplay is essentially completely reactive and plagued due to RNG at every step. It's not complex with the current card set and it's nothing like Chess where the initial state and immediate possible moves can be determined by a human skill level.

[list]
[*] Random initial placement of heroes and creeps
[*] Random card draws
[*] Random creep deployment every round
[*] Random attack directions
[*] Random draw of which item from your list you get to purchase during the shopping phase
[*] Random secret shop item and consumable item during the shopping phase, different for each player.
[*] Random card procs (Bounty Hunter, Ogre, etc)
[*] Randomness of card actives (Chainfrost, Eclipse)
[/list]

Is it possible for a better/perfect player to win 100% of the time? [b]No.[/b]

[b]The game just isn't complete.[/b] There have been a few features added since the game released, but they just aren't good enough.
[list]
[*] The chat interface is terrible. You can only chat by bringing up chat wheels. No chat log/box. Really, how hard would it be to have a chat box like your other 3 main games? Add an option to disable the chat box if you get butt-hurt by social interactions and can't handle it.
[*] No voice comms (with a disable option)
[*] Once a game is over, that's it. No replay, no stats, no game history, can't even tell who you just played against. Literally the only thing you can do once a game ends is immediately add them as a Steam Friend to chat... Any other game you've ever played is basically like it never existed.
[*] Progession system: Earn levels mainly dictated by a weekly time-gate to unlock a bunch of Icons.
[*] Ranking system: How can you tell if someone is good? You can't. There's a 1-75 rank bin it puts you in based on your hidden MMR, but it's essentially meaningless. You can't even see your opponents rank level! You can only see their Icon level which is basically just a measure of how much they play.
[*] No matchmaking leaderboards. (Featured mode win streaks leaderboard is useless)
[*] No unranked global matchmaking mode. Want to test some really bad ideas out? Play against a bot or else it's counting towards your hidden MMR.
[*] No demo mode. Want to try out cards you don't own? You can play against a bot that uses them, but you can't use them yourself.
[*] No anything profile related that you expect as standard after playing other Valve games.
[*] Basically, the only thing you can see about other people playing the game is their name and icon level in your current match only. (Or the dwindling concurrent user count online)

Because the game isn't inherently fun for the average person, there is no incentive to play. Valve's only option is to finish the game, make it more fun, more complete, and then relaunch as Free2Play without any paywalls so the other 90% of the world can try it out and create a better community. No players = no game.

Also, what about the $1,000,000 first place Artifact tournament scheduled for Q1 2019? When you consider the time it takes to announce and run qualifiers, and for players to secure their Visa's and schedule travel. There's only 2 possible options.
[olist]
[*] The 1st tournament is invite only and the invite only players are already decided, and Valve isn't telling us.
[*] The tournament is cancelled/postponed, and Valve isn't telling us.
[/olist]
After 110 hours of playtime, I can say:
"This game is a waste of time and money."
Yes I own all cards,
Yes I tried various technics.
Yes i played other card games.

DO NOT BUY - I did that mistake !
Congratulations new player! Here are 5 card packs that won't make any difference because you basicly had nothing interesting to combine them with anyways. Oh there comes your opponent! Someone 20 times your level because; well, there are no starting players for you to play with.
Enjoy getting wrecked until you pay more :)
Calculations about why people are leaving this game

Here are some calculations about expected return of Expert Draft/Constructed mode.

Assume an average player who's got 50% win rate, here's how much he is expected to get after a Expert Draft/Constructed run:
expected return = C(1,4)*(1/2^5)*7 + C(1,5)*(1/2^6)*(7+14) + (0.5^5 + C(1,5)*(1/2^6) )*(7+14*2) = 6.34375
So, average players' expected return rate is:
(6.34375 - 7）/ 7 = -9.43%

Explanation:
I use rmb as currency, which is 7 rmb for 1 ticket, 14 rmb for 1 card pack. But it doesn't matter what currency you use, we are calculating a ratio here.
C(1,4) means choose 1 out of 4, the same applies for C(1,5) which means choose 1 out of 5.
C(1,4)*(1/2^5)*7 is the expected return of 3 wins.
C(1,5)*(1/2^6)*(7+14) is the expected return of 4 wins.
(0.5^5 + C(1,5)*(1/2^6) )*(7+14*2) is the expected return of 5 win (with 0 lose or 1 lose).

Conclusion:

So, average players with 50% win rate is expected to LOSE 9.43% of his money each time they play an Expert Draft/Constructed game. This is astonishing and unacceptable. This is the only negative sum game that I know of (except lottery and gambling ). But Valve, you are a game company, not casino.

What's even worse is, when average players and below-average players find themselves constantly losing money, they just leave the game. That's what happened in the last 2 weeks. And with daily peak concurrent players of Artifact drops to around 10k, that means more than 80% of players have left the game. When that happens, those above-average players' win rate drops to 50% or below and starts to lose money. Then they will also leave the game. Things are getting worse day by day. Only the few top players will get positive expected returns. It's kind of like the poison circle in Player Unknown's battleground.

If there's no substantial change to this, daily peak concurrent players of Artifact will drop below 10k in the following few days.

I love the core mechanics of the game, and have spent more than dozens of Expert mode tickets. And I don't care about if it's F2P or not. But this Expert mode is just broken, because it keeps punishing players of the game until they just leave. I think Artifact has a huge potential but it's simply ruined by the arrogance of the people in Valve who ignore the urgent call of the players who actually pay for the game.
Without spending money, or using Tickets (which cost money) it is impossible to acquire new cards. So you start out, open your ten card packs, and those are the only cards you'll ever have for the rest of the game. Because there's no progression system of any kind, there's no real reason to play the game. It's like a real world TCG, but without any of the social aspects, nor the actual ownership of physical cards. 

I wouldn't recommend this game to literally anyone.
Even if you can overlook all the issues with how the game handles cards & microtransactions, a rapidly falling playerbase, a lack of meaningful progression, and its general poor launch - at it's core, Artifact's gameplay is an unsatisfying chore. 

There are very few times playing the game where random chance plays a small enough element for the average player to make a significant outplay, or carry out a game-long strategy outside of the premade 7+ mana game ending cards. The game includes a random element at each stage of gameplay - creep random lane spawns, attack direction arrows randomly generating, random card draw from your relatively large deck, random shop items each turn. This in my opinion leads to the vast majority of games being decided by which player draws the right random chance at a critical moment, rather than which player predicts the play of an enemy and plans around it. 

Sometimes all you needed to win a lost game was 1 card the whole game, a tp scroll to change a heroes lane after getting it deployed in a bad matchup for example, but the shop does not have a standard set of items, so you're out of luck. While winning, games feel very straightforward - you draw the right cards once or twice, and the game ends, in spite of losing your heroes over and over, or many misplays along the way. There is no clear path to victory without a good measure of luck, which makes a lot of your wins feel hollow and almost out of your hands.

Having said all that, the visual and audio design are fantastic, with a sleek menu system in the style of Dota, and an incredible amount of voiced lines for each card. There is clear effort and care taken with every part of the game, which only makes me more disappointed at how much of a near miss this game was. I do not see a way for this game to see a meaningful revival in playerbase outside of a complete overhaul and rerelease of a lot of the core gameplay and monetization, and even that could be a roll of the dice.
Pros:
Better visuals than most card games. Unique 3 lane gameplay allows for fun and varied gameplay styles. There are a ride range of cards at release and I can see some very big plays with certain decks builds. 

Cons:
There is zero way to gain cards other than pay out of your pocket. Every other card game has a ingame currency where you can grind to progress but not here. I am already bored of this game as there's no method of progression.
An excellent card game, flawed by a terrible monetization scheme. The gameplay and the mechanics are really good, which adds a breathe of fresh air to the genre, and the overall experience of the game itself. But the shady microtransaction practices prevent me to recommend it. The price of the purchase is not enough to fully enjoy it. You will need to spend more money to stay competitive, otherwise you'll be bound to the Draft Mode which at the moment doesn't have any progression system whatsoever, and doesn't allow to earn free cards. In fact, you can't earn free cards at all. Other similar games have login bonuses, dailies, weeklys, and many more mechanics to stay somewhat competitive even without paying anything more. With your purchase, only half of the game is available to you without paying more money. And this for me, is unacceptable. Unless something changes, at the moment, I don't recommend playing this game at all.
Game feels dead after a while with no progression unless u pay. Not sure why it was priced so high just to purchase the game when you can't have fun unless you pay more
Enter the Pay2Pay era!

Awesome production value, great mechanics, beautiful lore, but the game is built around a single purpose, to dump money into it. Everything requires payment, including the competitive mode, and as of now, there's no ladders, rankings or a progression system, not even achievements, imagine that. If you're not planning to dump hundreds of euros on a digital card game, steer away from it.

Valve is a real dissapointment these days, they've lost touch with their crowd, no longer a fan.
When you start the game for the first time and go trough tutorials, you're met with a pop-up message that claiming and opening your free packs makes this game non-refundable on Steam platform. Despite that red flag I accepted and continued to play for 2 days straight, before being met with a cruel realization that this game has many more microtransactions than I expected.

You start the game with 5 tickets and 10 card packs.
How to get more card packs:

[*]In order to get card packs, you need to use tickets that allow you to play in special game modes.
[*]The special game modes are just a highly RNG based (minus one) PvP battles (Not to mistake with TES:L PvE Arena system).
[*]One of these game modes allows you to draft 2 cards out of 5 pools of 10 cards and keep them after the game, but to start this mode you need to spend 2 TICKETS and 5 UNOPENED CARD PACKS.
[*]after you start one of the special games that consume tickets, you need to win minimum 3 games against other players, with maximum of 2 loses to get anything at all out of it. And that is just a refund of a ticket. Otherwise it's 1-3 tickets and 1-3 card packs, depending from wins.
[*]In case you didn't win 3 times and already lost 2 times, you get absolutely nothing and your used ticket/packs are gone.
[*]Or scratch all that and you buy card packs for roughly $2, because it's simply unlikely to win anything with the amount of out-of-control RNG that is going on in this game (No joke, it even randomizes the direction in which your creeps/heroes are going to deal damage)

Other ways of getting cards:
[*]Selling and buying them on Steam Market. However keep in mind that all the good cards are going to be much more expensive than any common board-filler. Many of them being more expensive then the card packs themselves.

How to get more tickets when you spent all of them on the game modes in hoping to win card packs:
[*] You spend irl money, around $5 per ticket.
[*] Recycling 2 card packs worth of cards (20 cards) to get 1 ticket.
[*] That's about it.

To sum it up - I really, REALLY hoped this game would be much better than what everyone else already guessed it to be. And I would lie if I said it wasn't a brand-based purchase.
Even with the crazy amounts of RNG, the game itself is pretty good, but the amount of paywalls is indeed downright disgusting. Some articles said you can play this game without spending any money, but how do you even expect to fight people who actually bought/earned enough cards to build reliable decks?

I do not recommand this game in its current state. The microtransactions are ridiculus. I only hope someday it will get a reasonable update with ways to get cards without spending money.

The fact alone you need to BUY an online card game is crazy enough.

EDIT: Isn't that just ridiculus in itself that people would need to come up with some plans and financial strategies to overcome the paywalls/make it worth your time?
Instead of advocating such behaviors and thinking workarounds, it should be brought down to the ground level and call it what it is - a ridiculus amount of microtransactions.
I have 2 accounts of artifact with a total of around 500hrs for both accounts. I find this game very fun and addictive but there are many flaws in this game that makes me very angry. 

As it is right now, I would not recommend this game for these 4 main reasons .

Problem 1: If you ever play DOTA, you know how important a TP scroll is. Well someone forgot to tell valve this because you can be stuck the whole game and not be able to buy a  TP scroll even with with 1 Billion Gold. 

Why can't you buy a tp scroll you ask? Well someone decided to make it appear randomly in the shop so if i doesn't appear you can't buy it even with all the gold in the world.   And you basically lose the game. Stupid? Yes.

Solution 1:  Make the TP scrolls non random by allowing players to buy it every 2 turns.

Problem 2: In DOTA, creeps waves spawn in every lane which makes sense. Unlike this game, creeps appear randomly and if they don't spawn in your lane, well u basically lose. Which makes no sense.

Solution 2: Make creeps spawn evenly in each lane. 

Problem 3: The chat mechanic in this game is so bad. There is 0 general /guild chat room. Talking to your opponent is so hard and annoying it's not even worth it. 

Solution 3:  Make a general/guild chat room so when people log in, they can chat. Also make chatting easier for players during game play so they can communicate with their opponent and have ignore option as well in case the opponents are rude.

Problem 4: There is no leaderboard or ladder ranking system for competition and rewards, aside from just gaining levels. 

Solution 4: Have a player ranking play system, so players who climb the ladder will have greater rewards and recognition than those who are on the lower rank.
Amazing card game that I'm probably never going to play again because of 2 reasons. Why? Read on my brief comments below...

After 50+ hours of gameplay, here are my 2 cents:
[h1][b]1. NO PROGRESSION [/b][/h1] - why in the world wouldn't you add a progression and gamification/level system to a game like this? You absolutely cannot level up or feel the "completition" achievement in any of the game modes...
[h1][b]2. EVENT TICKETS [/b][/h1]- now this one is a joke. Basically, if you want to play ranked (called "expert" in Artifact and earn packs) you need an event ticket that, guess what.... Can only be BOUGHT for like a $1 (or you can farm these tickets if you have high win-rate ratio in ranked), so basically you either need to be REALLY GOOD at the game to continue playing ranked or just spent bucks TO PLAY RANKED. Bear in mind, you've already bought the game for 20$.

also: 
- - - NO PROFILE TAB TO VIEW ANY STATS
- - - ZERO INTERACTION WITH OPPONENT

Isn't this ridicolous?
The game is fun. Games take some time, like 20ish++ minutes a match.

In my opinion, the most important aspect for complexity in these type of games comes from the possibility of being able to interact/disrupt your opponent. Hearthstone doesn't have any of it except for its Secret mechanic while Magic and Yu-Gi-Oh allow you to play cards in the middle of the opponents turn. Artifact, much like Gwent, takes a middle-road of sorts in where each of you play a single card in turns. This, by itself, gives it already a lot more design space for complexity than many other games of this genre.

Then there is also the game-design by itself which is simply pure genius, and honestly really refreshing compared to what else is out there. If you're looking into buying this game, and actually reading a review, I'm sure you're already aware of how it functions. There are a lot of small decisions to make that ultimately amount to your victory or lose and a lot of cool cards that allow for diverse playstyles. Concepts like pass bluffing and manipulating initiative are important. So is deciding to abandon a lane or purposefully keeping an enemy hero (in draft, which has limited mobility options) alive to lock him out of the game. It's just immense and you really have to take a step back and think about the overall situation rather than blindly following your simple game-plan. 

Then there is the RNG, with the advent of digital CCG/TCG there comes a myriad of advantages that just weren't possible in a physical format. Such as changing existing cards. One of such possibilities is the inclusion of RNG-esque things. The main-three RNG elements are the card-draw, the item-market, and the direction of your creeps and heroes attack - which can be manipulated. Those are all fine and fundamentally balanced parts of the game. But then there are some really heavy RNG cards. My personal rule of thumb is: Can this card more-or-less single-handedly win you the game, even if it's just a miniscule chance? If so, bad RNG. There are some cards like that in the game. Like Cheating Death which turns the death of your units into a coin-flip. Every. Single. Time. (Imagine doing that in reality, takes a while)

Compared to the most famous digital CCG, Hearthstone, the amount of such RNG-centric cards are really just miniscule. BUT they give an insight into the design philosophy of the future of the game. Essentially, it's not impossible for more of such cards to be printed and, sooner or later, they add up. An example of this would be the digital CCG Shadowverse. Which, at its release, only had a single relevant card of 'target a random enemy and deal 1 damage'. This was years ago. Now, after many expansions? There is a whole lot more.

Despite all the praise and fun I have with Artifact, I have to give the game a negative review, however. Why? Because of the pricing policy Valve is displaying and thus, by extension, that they care more about profit than their consumers.

Just for the record, I despise an f2p experience like Hearthstone, too. Blizzard designed the game in a way that, unless you spend actual money, you progress really really slow or have to invest insane amounts of time. If I had to name my ideal f2p experience it would be Shadowverse or Gwent. My ideal digital CCG experience would look like something akin to a monthly subscription with card-progression that isn't designed to get you to spend more money.

I also want to mention that it's theoretically possible to increase your collection without spending more money. By winning 4 games in a draft you get your ticket back and a card pack. And this possibility is what made me ultimately buy the game.

Now, with all that out the way. Their pricing policy. I am not talking about being able to 'only' buy more packs with actual money. I'm talking about the cut they take from selling cards on the steam market. You already pay money to receive the cards in the first place. Valve made their profit. But they want more. Because more profit is good, but it costs the consumer.  Capitalism, ho! What will this bring for the future? Nothing good. 

It's sad to see a company that used to make games(lol) now 100% exploits it as a business opportunity.
Pay for access, pay to win, pay to play outside of practice modes. Everything is pay, pay, pay.
Gameplay itself is ok, but has some flaws. Match takes too long (around 40 minutes), and there's too much randomness for my liking.
Famous quote: "When people in beta complained about Drow being OP, Valve didn't nerf her. Instead, they changed her rarity from uncommon to rare."

My dear reader, have patience and let me tell you all the truth about Shartifact, truly a unqiue game full of hype and fan anticipation (ok?)...

Artifuck is a game with awesome balance. More than half of the cards are completely worthless, some of them being straight up terrible in every possible situation being completely outclassed by others. (Some of them are also entirely outclassed by items everyone can buy, so no niche color specific mechanics hehehe). You would think a basic introductionary set of cards consisting almost entirely of raw stat buffs would be easy to balance... oh no! That is of course not true, it's intended as the creator of this awesome game is no other than the TCG GOD himself, Richard Garfield, with his genious philosophy of:
"People who play with the bad cards are stupid because they haven't figured out which are the good ones.".

So yes, having filler worthless cards to fill up a booster box is of course something very valuable to have in a digital card game. Artifatfuck is exactly that, a very close emulation of your typical scummy greedy TCG card game where your average competitive match consists of the same deck in every fucking damn game... It's all about skill, getting that +4 all possible stats instawin card first before your opponent. You shouldn't question why all tournaments use random draft games when this game has such variety and balance (random draft as in "pick random cards, but not the useless ones, that wouldn't be professional").

The promised "highest fidelity" gameplay is evident, with skills such as "50% chance anyone survives on 1 hp", "completely stop your opponent from doing anything this turn as long as you act first", you are left with awesome mindful games consisting of: uncontrollable random creep placement, uncontrollable random hero placement, uncontrollable random attack targetting, uncontrollable random variety of shop items... Wait, wait, I am just telling you this game can seriously be run on a casino slot machine and no one would notice.

Valve made sure to bring some very successful capitalist practices and they did well emulating your greedy uncle's game shop. With the slogan of "no free breakfast", you are ready to get into this TRADING card game. Just open the Steam Market and buy some effin cards (thank God the prices got lower and Axe doesn't cost more than the actual game now!), Valve will thank you for purhasing this game and then get another 15% tax on each bought card too. Don't think about direct free trade with your friends, that's illegal and hurts the free market economy... you understand, goyim?
You can't bring cards out of nothing, so NO GRINDING, sorry! This is real life TCG (but also this game is very unique and innovative don't forget!). You should know how much work has Valve put into making and distributing these cards. The only way to actually get more cards is.. you guessed it right? It's good to remember your greedy uncle's game shop now. You can play with the good guys only if you pay tickets to enter the "local tournament", your prize, of course, is the ticket you paid to enter.. and a card pack if you manage to finish well enough. Or you know, just buy the cards you need from the market, as that would be the only way to win anyway. (Here I should be telling you to invest in crypto instead, and make your greedy uncle pay your taxes. You can go one level further and make your video card more useful and happy to not render Artifail.)

Don't get me wrong, you probably heard lots of good stuff about this game. Valve made sure to organize a closed invite only closed beta closed tournament with all the good card professional players you all love, they surely loved this game too and weren't there only for the money. Ahm.
Of course, you heard all the good stuff about Artifag from them and how they are happily still playing and streaming this best card game ever made, and also talking about it non-stop to their friends and their friends' mothers (and their mothers' friends' friends). You should follow them too and do it exactly as well (that is: continue playing Heartsone/Gwent/thatothergameyoulove, you don't have to think about it too much, you will do well sabotaging the competition). Valve carefully listened well to all their honest positive feedback, such game consisting of masterfully perfected core mechanics barely changed throughout the whole beta period. Even the official post-beta release is still lacking basic game functionality like chat, replays, any leaderboards or any rank system or any game history/statistics at all...
Numbers don't lie. It is THAT good and E X C I T I N G! (now pat yourselves on the back Valve)

As a good reviewer, I would tell you to definitely get this game. That is, if there are still people playing it by the time it goes free to play. :)

Either way. May RNGesus have mercy on your green paper!
Artifact is unfortunately a really great game, and the best card game I've ever played. Why is that unfortunate? Because it's a money vacuum. It requires constant feeding of cash, with new packs planned to come out and no way to earn them for free. Cards on the market have a tax so you slowly lose your investment for every exchange you do. Events require paid tickets.

This is a credit card game with limitless potential to spend spend spend. And that's really sad because again, it's a really good game but they use that fact in addition to manipulative monetization to get you to pay up even more and regularly.
As a longtime CCG player, I've experienced a lot of games.  Been decent at a few... not pro level but could follow a meta and win a local tourney or two.  Magic, Star Wars (the original) CCG, LOTR, Hearthstone, Eternal CCG.  All had/have flaws, but I don't regret any of them.

I regret Artifact.  It kills me but I do.

Never in my time playing card games has a collectable game been so... unfun.  I read the hype about how it was designed by Garfield, was made to be an extremely competitive and cerebral game, and it sold me.  I would have tried it had the reviews been entirely negative, because I would have rationalize those people just weren't ready for a competitive card game.  Man was I wrong.  And I'm not even sure WHY I was wrong... it just isn't good.  It may be extremely tactical, and for all I know at the very top level of play it's the greatest game ever.  But for us average to even "good" players?  Horrendous.

The three lane concept is cute but ultimately unrewarding and extremely frustrating.  Part of the joy of playing these games is the cards, and Artifact uniquely is designed to prevent that.  Crucial moment in a lane?  The enemy can kill/silence your hero and prevent the play of that entire color of card.  Tactical?  Sure.  Fun?  Absolutely not, its awful.  I've played vintage through standard magic extensively, the mind games are not new.   What is new is the sheer amount of ways to prevent cards from being played.  Not countered, or nullified via clever play.  Stuck in your hand, useless, for extended periods.  Add this to the fact that the game is extremely long and tedious (single games can take an extended amount of time), and it really isnt any fun to play at all.

Flavorwise?  None.  Like dry toast left in the rain.  The cards, the characters, the mechanics... its painful to even look at.  How do you enjoy a game when everything from the art to the style of interaction is so dry?  I can't do it, I'm sorry.  

I really get the sense that the entire focus of the game, from A to Z, was twitch streamers.  Somebody thought this would be a great E-Sports game.  They lost sight of the idea that E-Sports games require an audience that gives a crap, and from my experience and the reviews I've read I don't think anyone will in a year.  A painful flop, that I really didn't want to be a flop.

If it's still around in a year, read the current reviews and see if they've fixed anything.  But I doubt it.  I think this one is stillborn, sadly.

TL;DR - I have mixed feelings about the game. Don't like the cost of playing / time investment. I don't think I would buy / play it, even if it were free to play. I also think that if this game came from any other developer, it would never get off the ground...But that's my opinion. 

For those wondering, I had a beta key, which translated into a free copy of the game.
*Updated the review to try to reflect the game release.*

What follows is my own opinion. I cannot speak for everyone, and believe everyone is entitled to their own opinion. If you have the spare cash and curious about the game, go ahead and buy it and make your own judgment.

I've dabbled in a few card games in the past few years (now that they're popular), and by no means an expert. I've played MTG, Hearthstone, Elder Scrolls: Legends and a few others here and there, including some table tops with some personal friends. I will try not to compare Artifact too much to other games, but they also tend to be the baseline for comparison.

Without further ado...

Artifact brings its own spin on the electronic card game genre. It pulls from other card games like the colours + varying playstyles from MTG and the lanes function from Elder Scrolls: Legends, all the while implementing core concepts from Dota like lanes, item purchasing, heroes, creeps and abilities.

Pros:
+ Visuals are really nice. If you like the visual style from Dota, you'll feel right at home.
+ Unique card mechanics you don't see in other card games (like Cleave), while implementing traditional mechanics like deathtouch (insta-kill) and trample (additional damage to lifepoints).
+ Win condition in the game is pretty cool. Destroy two of three towers in different lanes or Destroy the tower + Core in one lane.
+ Deckbuilding is nice. Minimum of 40 cards (no limit) and 9 items. The two are distinct from one another and don't contribute towards the same card total. I anticipate the game will bring in a lot of different deck permutations to keep the meta fresh. You have plenty of creeps, spells and Improvements (a type of passive ability you can add to a lane)
+ Cards and heroes bring unique abilities to the table
+ Access to casual (free) game modes like drafts, constructed (more on that below) and friend battles (albeit with no rewards).

All and all, Artifact is a nice card game which although doesn't bring anything super revolutionary, is still unique enough to keep things fresh. I don't anticipate the game to become stale because everyone can pick different colour combinations, each with different playstyles AND different heroes to choose from with varying abilities.

I should note while deckbuilding that each hero comes with three ability cards which contribute towards the card total for a deck. You are obligated to pick 5 heroes per deck, which takes 15 card slots from a minimum of 40. Make of it what you want. I personally think it's good for newer players to alleviate the deckbuilding process, but also think it is a little restrictive if you want a low card count while also ensuring you have everything you need from your deck. But then again, you can't have everything without making compromises.

Cons:
- LOOOONG games. This is partly due to the fighting in the three lanes. Each player gets 30-45 seconds to play a card, followed by another 30-45 second rebuttle until each player passes, then there's a face off. You can easily spend 5 minutes in a single lane, and deal next to no damage to the enemy tower. Games can easily last 20 minutes to an hour.
- Difficult to understand mechanics (at first). The tutorial only skims over the core concepts of the game, but this is no Hearthstone. The only way to learn the mechanics is to try them out. It can be difficult to understand which spells affects which target and who can target who. Don't get me wrong, complexity is awesome! However, I think the tutorial should provide examples of certain spells. Some descriptions could also benefit of a wording update.
- Lack of reward system for investing time. No login rewards, no in-game currency, and no way to "win" packs without spending money.
- The best card in this game is your credit card. The only way to obtain cards, packs and event tickets (this last one can also be acquired through card recycling) is through real money transactions. When the game releases, the marketplace will be available to purchase cards. This also means that unless you are willing to spend money, you will be locked out from competitive game modes such as phantom draft or keeper draft. If you intend to play competitively, constructed, and keep up with the game evolution and/or meta, expect to have to purchase cards/packs as they come out.
- The monetization model is disappointing to say the least. The game costs $22USD (which granted, provides you with two decks, 5 event tickets and 10 packs). The initial game cost + paying for cards + paying for packs + paying for event tickets will hurt you where it hurts most: Your wallet. Lord Gaben will roll around in the cash cow that is the card game genre in 2018.

If you've made it this far, I hope this review was helpful to make the decision on whether or not to buy the game. For me, it comes down to finances and the length of the games. I don't see myself capping out my credit card on virtual cards nor spending an hour to play a single game with no reward at the end of it all, especially when its competitors provide incentives to keep playing (in the form of card packs or in-game currency). If Valve comes up with a way to reward players for time spent playing, I might reconsider. As it stands currently, I can't recommend the game.
Do NOT buy this game. It is a very obvious scam. I refunded this after an hour.
I paid almost 30CAD for this game, finished the 2 game tutorial vs bots and was told to claim my reward, 2 starter decks, 5 event tickets and some other stuff. At the very bottom in small print, the game tells you if you claim your starter items you give up your ability to refund the game. I declined claiming the items so that i could try the game out a bit first before deciding if i would commit. 
And....  you are locked out of any social modes, competitive or casual until you claim your starting items and tell valve they can bend you over. Red flags.

GAMEPLAY
____________

pretty slow paced and clunky from the 1 hour i played of it. Just go play magic arena
Very disappointed I can't expand my library of cards without paying real cash. I feel like I paid an expensive cover fee to a really aesthetically pleasing bar that doesn't serve any alcohol on a Saturday night... 

I would be willing to grind if I felt I could eventually get the cards I wanted...

I guess I should've paid closer attention to the comments before going off the hype.

Great concept visually and gameplay-wise, I think the communities are waking up to money-grabbing schemes put on by the branding companies...*Cough*Bethesda- Fallout76*Cough* - there are too many of companies trying to do the same schemes for the creators to keep getting away with it. The people who earn money by trading their time, which is a vast majority of their player base, are like sheep being lead to the slaughter house.
Old Review | Before the update of December 21th :
---------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a PAY TO HAVE, PAY TO PLAY and PAY TO WIN game, with 0 game and deck progress for players who want to play "free". Has not any features or modes which will intigue you to play, as other card games do.
If you willing to pay some money, you can buy specific cards and make spesific decks which are practicaly and literally unbeatable. 0 challenge, 0 strategy.
That's my opinion after 72h playing, as a DotA, DotA 2 and many card games player. Very disappointed.


Updated / Additional Review | After the update of December 21th :
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You can now get up to 15 tickets and card packs for the current season for free ( season will last "few months"). I don't know if this is gonna be on every season, if it will be the same number of tickets and packs and how long will a season last to tell if 15 are many of few. It's better than nothing, which it was before, but maybe -or maybe not- it's a little cheese for the 48% of bad ratings. We'll see on the future.
- Account progress is now enabled and trackable, that's good, but I would like to see which are all these "playstyle awards" which give you extra exp. They are there, they work, but you don't know who they are.
- Some cards were nerfed, like Traxex and Axe, but still, there are these cards combinations that i reffered on my comments earlier which are unreal. That's still a big problem on the game balance.

I stopped playing Constructed, because I was mostly encountering these 2 decks and I'm playing only Draft for now, which I find more fair, because you can't pay just to copy unstoppable decks, it's based on strategy and a little bit on luck. I enjoy playing Draft, I don't like playing Constructed.

In conclusion, the update was a good thing. Of course they had to do it to fix the ratings ratio; it's a product and they want good ratings for good money. But there is still staff that needed to be added in my opinion; It's a big company with a big product on the background (DotA 2) to be just this. I guess more staff will be added on the near future.
Since there is not a "neutral vote" on the review and also the game is not balanced yet, I'll keep the "No" recommendation, which I hope I'll change on the next update(s).
The game itself doesn't look bad. In the beginning you will have tons of fun, building decks, opening your first 10 packs and luckily acquiring Axe as rare hero, just like I did.
After that, I was playing around in the social plays and I was really enjoying the game.
But later, it gets boring and boring. The cards that matter are so expensive! You will get stuck in a way that you can not expand your library if you don't spend some money in the market or by buying some packs. 
If you like being competitive (like I do), you have 5 tickets on the beginning and that's it... you need to satisfy yourself with the casual play or buy some tickets with real money.
For those who have played MTG Arena you will understand my point here. MTG has a system that you can play for free. Are you going to take a long time until you build your deck? The answer is yes! But at least you have the feeling that you're moving forward with the deck you wanna build.
As a result... ARTIFACT: no money = no cards = boredom
Unfortunately!
This is going to be a long and lengthy review, but before I start I want to give myself some credibility.
First of all, I have never played dota 2, so I am in no position to comment on the lore/truthfulness to the game/etc.

However, I consider myself a hardcore TCG/CCG player, I've top 100'd in hearthstone 8 months in a row, I played MTG for 15+ years and top 8'd many ptqs and gps, I won the champion cup in shadowverse, and in general I play a LOT of card games, and tend to do well in them.

That being said I think I am in a good position to critique this game.

First of all, the graphics:
This has got to be one of the best looking card games I've seen in my life. Every card has it's own voice, lore, and is rendered wonderfully, the board, hands, and little devil-sprites (I'm sure they have a name) are fantastic looking. In my books the graphics are 10/10.

Second, HUD:
The HUD menu out-of-game is a little unintuitive, some buttons are placed in weird places, opening or editing your decks requires you to "load" them (instead of all your decks being listed, you have to hit a "load" button and then "save" when you're done), deckbuilding is ok-ish. Your deck is a list of card names, you drag other cards from a list (your collection) unto your deck (another list). I would've liked to see some kind of binder or catalogue where either the deck, or the collection is spread out with full size cards instead of just a "name" in text that you have to click on to find out what the card does. In game HUD, again, looks fantastic, but sometimes when the opponent takes a while on their turn there's nothing to do (in hearthstone you can click the environment, in MTGarena, shadowverse, and others your mouse has particle effects that you can draw with) - not really a big deal to be fair, I'm just being anal. There's also always a card pack floating in the "buy packs" screen, this card pack shows whether or not you have a pack, which get's a bit confusing because the game makes it look like I have an unopened card park in my collection.

Next and the most important aspect of the game - what to do:
Unfortunetly there isn't much to do outside of playing the game. There is no ranked mode, there is no leaderboard, there is no rewards of any kind, no in-game currency, no profile icons, no cardbacks, no new voicepacks/game tables, no rank beside your profile, no progression of ANY KIND. If you play a game and win, what do you win? Nothing. Play and lose, nothing. In effect there is no grind, no climb, and overall this is the ONE thing that keeps me from recommending this game to people. This encourages players to play wacky/stupid decks instead of competetive decks, which is fun for those players, but not for players who want to win. The one "competetive" game mode in the game consists of spending a ticket (a currency) to enter an "expert tournament" - A gamemode that ends when you lose twice, and has rewards for up to a maximum of 5 wins, which is a grand prize of a ticket and TWO packs. Yes that's right, TWO packs.

If you're the best player in the entire game you have to grind out this boring "tournament" for two packs, which is redundant for two reasons, first of all, the cards in this game are very limited (as of now) and you can effectively buy 3 of every card in the game for $30 thanks to the in-game market (you can buy and sell cards, however 95% of the cards sell for $0.02). This means that it's cheaper to buy your decks that open a bunch of packs to get the cards, and second, you get prettymuch 90% of the cards in the game from opening around 20-30 packs ($50), since only about half the cards are playable, packs become useless (especially 2 as a grand prize) and most people will just buy other players' excess cards for cents. This results in the game's "expert tournament", a mode where you pay 1 ticket, and if you WIN ALL YOUR GAMES, you get back 1 ticket, and 2 packs, being completely unsatisfying.

I would like to see the wins extended to 8 or even 12, and bigger prizes.

Next, I want to explain something to all of you, in any given card game, there are what are called "whales", these players make up 0.5%-1.5% of the playerbase but account for 50% of the revenue for card games.

I want to bring this up because there is something missing from this game. Foils.
"Premium", "Foil", "Animated", or "Golden" cards are animated or holographic versions of cards that are hard to obtain. Players like me want a fully foil deck - and we are willing to pay for it. If valve implements Foils into the game, the "whales" will spend A LOT MORE MONEY on packs trying to get foils, the community will open a lot more packs trying to get expensive $100 foils that they can sell on the marketplace, there is FINANCIAL reasons to add foils, but also it makes opening packs much more exciting! Casual players will gamble because there's a chance to get big money, and packs will suddenly become appealing, because again, after spending about $40 you own every card in the game, and card packs become useless.

I wanted to talk about gameplay but I feel I've rambled on too much. If you're still reading this by now, this game needs a way to progress, so a win FEELS like a win, a ranked system - with monthly or yearly rewards, an esports scene, a profile that you can show off, a way to communicate in the game, and a way of determining who the best is, and ofcourse, FOILS.

Until any of these are implemented I cannot recommend this game with good concious.
I don't recommend this game for the following reasons:

1. Silly economy. 
The description "pay to pay to play" pretty much sums it up. The game is not free to play, yet expects people who are interested in prize play to constantly pay for tickets... AND pay for cards on the market on top of all that? Very much feels like they're trying to have the cake and eat it, too.

2. Lack of a progression system. 
They more or less tried to fix this with a rushed leveling system... but it's far too slow and far too unrewarding to incentivize staying in this mess of a game. 

3. The game itself. 
All of the above might not be that bad, if the game was awesome. After all, abusive business models in digital CCGs are pretty much a given nowadays (unfortunately)... But it's just not that good. The gameplay is unintuitive for newcomers, full of infuriating randomness (I'll say it: much more so than even Hearthstone.) and just feels clunky overall. The three lane thing might have been a neat idea in terms of translating the DOTA feel to a card game, but it doesn't seem to bring all that much depth to the table, in my opinion. It's just a BO3 in which all matches are played simultaneously. What you're left with is a game of trying to stack more numbers on your side of the board. Boring.

4. Valve's silence. 
I know that's just the Valve way and all that, but maybe that approach just doesn't cut it anymore in 2019. Considering the magnitude of the trainwreck, some more info on what they're actually attempting here might have gone a long way in helping people trust that betterment is on the way. Personally, I have given up and sold all my cards already, with a lesson learned to not believe the hype of big names.
Buy game.
Open packs.
Sell Cards for profit.
Uninstall game.

Edit: I gotta admit the gameplay itself really isn't that bad.
Though the monetization model is absolutely unacceptable.
The game itself plays perfectly fine, if not a little on the way too slow side. It's a fine enough Magic style tabletop game with the added functions only a digital environment could achieve. It's fun at times, but not something I can really sit myself down for often enough.

 But I just cannot get behind the games monetization. One of the advantages of making a digital ccg over a physical one is that you can get rid of all the problems the distribution of physical card games have, like replacing paying for individual cards with things like Hearthstone's dusting system (which is admittedly on the stingy side when it comes to actually dusting cards but I digress). 

Not only does this game not try to break free of traditional methods of card distribution, it actively encourages it with how easy it is to just put cards onto the community market. The game is also twenty goddamn dollars at base, with the justification being they give you packs (which they just recently cut down to 5 from 10 btw), some event tickets (which are also for sale and your only way to enter the competitive ladder and drafts) and two semi-playable decks. But even games like Magic make and give away free decks to dip your toes into the game and figure the basics, and Hearthstone has the decency of things like Brawls and quests to earn more packs.

The entry fee of $20 is utterly unjustified here for the actual beginner's experience. I wanted to give this game a chance since I love Mr Garfield's game designs, but I just can't. For a similar enough experience, just go play Magic.
SEEMINGLY AGAINST ALL ODDS artifact is a massive failure in nearly every way. valve has plenty of stellar designers, quite literally billions of dollars at their disposal, all the data they could ever ask for.. and they made this.

the art's beautiful yet dull. i'm not sure it could be more boring. axe literally just wants to fight all the time and yet his art displays him standing triumphantly gazing off into the distance. like that was really the best you could do? he's not swinging in for a dunk? tf? dunking is the axe dream and it's not reflected in the card art at all. and nearly every single card is like this. beautiful yet ultimately floundering around the core identity of the hero or item.

the game is exhausting to play. wins feel empty. losses feel awful because a single match takes so long and if you're playing artifact properly and paying every ounce of attention you have on exploiting the initiative mechanic, it's exhausting. maybe the games feel so long because the game is such a drag to play? hard to know.

you're asked to pay for the game once then you're asked to pay a dollar to play the competitive mode every time you want a better experience.

artifact takes all of your attention and as much money as it can get. it demands everything and leaves you with nothing.

it's clear that artifact is nothing more than a monument of valve's greed. i ache for the days when they were ambitious and wanted to tell breathtaking stories and weren't looking to pilfer a few more dollars from my wallet. 

and in a way i'm happy that artifact failed as badly as it did. maybe valve will return to making great video games again. it has to be an awful feeling to have a project you spent five years on fall apart as badly as this, but maybe they'll learn some lessons from it when valve releases their next game in ten years.

please don't buy into this disaster. burning your money to keep warm on a cold night would bring you more joy than artifact.

and if you've read this far and want more, i'd like to take another 40 seconds of your time and ask you to watch this: https://clips.twitch.tv/MagnificentPluckyCucumberFrankerZ

artifact is the hero that cant attack, cant move, but is ultimately balanced and skillful. 

valve is so out of touch with their fans it hurts.
It's hard for me to openly and honestly recommend Artiact as it currently stands. The draft mode is probably the most compelling aspect of it, but every time I boot up the game and play a few games I end my session feeling exhausted. Not in the "Ah that was a satisfying battle of wits way" but more of a "There's just a lot of information on screen" kind of way.

I feel like many of the systems in the game aren't there for gameplay, they're there to be similar to Dota 2, and while I appreciate the efforts, they just don't work well together.

The two biggest pains points for me: Imbalance and Randomness.

Card games do not have perfectly balanced cards, it's the nature of the beast and what ends up making draft formats funs. But Artifact is different in that it has Heroes. Unlike "bombs" you draft in, say, Magic: The Gathering, heroes are core to your strategy in the game, and keep coming back the entire game. They sway battles just by existing, sometimes in other lanes. The difference in a good hero and a bad one is GIGANTIC, to the point where having one or two key heroes in your draft can seriously carry you hard.

Randomness is also huge in Artifact. It's built into the core game. Due to how position on units works, you have a 25% chance to attack a target to your left or right, regardless of if your lane is full or empty. This takes away from a lot of the strategy planning ahead can have in combat, but does make combat tricks feel more valuable. Either way, this on top of the three decks in your shop, on top of natural card draw, on top of cards with random effects... It just feels like too much. The series of small random chances do help shake up the game, but sometimes they throw battles into your opponents favor out of seemingly nowhere. It makes for good back and forth gameplay sometimes, but even after 15 hours I can feel it grating on me. 

Artifact is a good game for a certain kind of player, I'm on the fence on whether or not I'm that kind of player. I'm enjoying Casual Phantom Draft for now but each time I run through a draft, I just find myself not wanting to touch the game for a few days. 

Artifact might be for you, but it's certainly not for everyone.
This is one of the most fun games I've EVER played, super addicting, but the systems in play are f---ing horrible. 

Pros:
- Great gameplay, addicting
- Barely feel 'helpless' and that there's always outplay because of the unique gameplay
- Represents Dota as a card game well (I have 4k hours in D2)
- Great unit interactions (like in Dota 2)
- No rigid 'objectively best' deck, lot of variation and RNG involved in determining what decks will control momentum. 
- Seems relatively* balanced in my experience? I've played many multi-colour decks that I thought were powerful. 

Cons: 
- Terrible social features, non-descriptive and basically not there. (e.g. You can't add your opponents in-game.)
- No in-game viewer for Pro-games (like in Dota 2)
- No progression system whatsoever
- No ranked/ladder, it's basically the wild west in non-expert constructed. One game is against whales (Modify Player with Big Credit Card), and another is against someone who is running 4 colour. 
- Terrible monetisation, you're basically stuck in a 'Expert Loop' where you're basically going to go 3-2 (T H R E E  H O U R S  W A S T E D) most of the time and get perfect runs only if you get insanely lucky on Draft, or lucked out on your free packs so you have good items and heroes to beat the crap out of people in Constructed. And guess what, if you run out of tickets you better hit the market place to buy 20 cheap cards that cost slightly less than a dollar, it's better than how they force you to buy tickets in sets of 5 for 5 dollars. 

Rant Section - Suggestions & Frustrations (feel free to skip): 
If I had to sum it up, the only people who plugging the hell out of this game are streamers and people willing to play by the 'real card game economy' type structure because they believe that it works, because they have enough extraneous money to just not give a damn about it. Yes, if card packs were easier to get, card value inevitably goes down, and that would destroy the ticket system. But you know what? If this game had /DAILY QUESTS/ that gave you ONE ticket per day it would not destroy the economy, you know why? Because you still have to buy in to this game. You still have to win the 4/5 games in Expert to get card packs, and honestly based on the way most people who aren't 500 IQ players goes, it's not going to affect the market severely. Sure, some rarer cards might go down, but cards will always be worth something *because* of the ticket system. And the fact that people can't grind alts or throw games by multi-boxing means that a lot of the problems of f2p card games goes away. 

"You're just mad because you're bad" - Calling out Reddit/Steam Forums: 
There's honest criticism to be given to this game, because it's a great game, but plagued by terrible decisions. Honest conversation can only be had when people who are paying out the arse for this game shut the hell up and actually understand that not all experiences will be the same. They make tonnes of money from this shit, you don't need to defend them. Especially when they're driving away people who you KNOW would love this game if not for the horrible model and [lack of] systems. 

Also the tutorial explains things, but they should have like a card ruleset or something

Ending Statement: 
I don't give a shit what 'real life card game economies' are like, Credit Cardifact is going to drive away players, Influencers and streamers are doing them a favour by being able to avoid criticising monetisation, seeing as they already have a shit tonne of money since they're not advertising it for money but because they know the game is fun. Valve won't back down from drawing people into a game because they think they can 'profit by playing', but people should at least know it's pretty unrealistic to just farm packs out the ass unless they shell out for a solid Expert Constructed deck. 

TL;DR - Best card game, terrible monetisation, non-existent Quality of Life, no quests or sense of progression. 

Why the hell did you think about an economy first and player experience (outside of matches) second?
This game has so much potential but in its current state is not fun. The fundamentals of a good game are there - this game takes a lot of strategy to play well. The presentation is also great - card art and sounds are top notch. The number one issue with this game is progression. Unless you pay money, there really is no sense of progression in this game. Sure, Valve added a barebones progression system in a recent patch but it's laugable how poorly that was implemented. If you're on the fence about this game, do not buy it now. Valve will likely fix several shortcomings with future patches and expansions so at some point this game will be worth buying.
The monetisation of Artifact has been done to death, ultimately people will decide if they want to put money into what I would say is a relatively cheap card game compared to others on the market, so instead I'm just going to discuss the gameplay.

First up, the gameplay itself is very engaging. It's undeniable that matches are incredibly intense and absorbing experiences. There're plenty of things to keep track of without being too overwhelming, and the cards are fun to play around with even if there's a lack of fancy visual effects to everything. One of Artifact's least touted, but I believe best, features is that you're very rarely out of a match until you lose your last few structure points. I've eked out wins from opening positions that went disasterously and I've had victory snatched away from me in situations where I'd been ahead all game. That kind of balance in a card game, particularly in Artifact which has relatively few board clear effects, is pretty impressive.

On a bad note about the gameplay, the learning curve to the strategy is somewhat fiddly. You make a lot of decisions in Artifact that, unfortunately, you never really get to find out if they were good or not. For instance, if you choose to abandon a lane then you'll never really know how it impacted the game outcome, even after the match finishes, because games generally run close anyway. You could argue that this just means that figuring out the strategic nuances in the game will take longer and so players will remain invested in playing, but it's sort of frustrating when you're trying to learn, and I suspect it's the kind of thing you only really have an understanding of after a considerable number of hours.

However, engaging gameplay aside, Artifact does have one big problem at the moment and that's that there's not actually anything meaningful to do in it yet. There's no progression. If you play at the moment then you're just playing for the thrill of the matches themselves. The only meaningful progression available is the Expert Phantom Draft, which rewards card packs. If you're good then you can technically grind up a collection this way while still playing and enjoying the game. You could also get packs from Expert Constructed wins to expand your collection, however to play Constructed in the first place then you've probably paid to get a fair bit of the game collection already anyway. But that's it. There's no ladder, no visible ranked matchmaking (the casual matchmaking will put you against someone at your MMR, but it's not a visible number), no achievements, no campaign adventure, nothing.

It's understandable that the game's essentially in early days and the game itself works beautifully, but there's just not a lot to do at the moment that earns you any kind of progression. Arguably, playing the game itself and getting more skillful at it is meaningful progression, but, let's face it, the gamers of today (myself included) want something visible to show for their time. Even an account level experience bar like in DOTA would be a start!

To finish, I've enjoyed the ~20 hours I've put in so far and I haven't spent a penny other than the initial buy in. I've Casual Phantom Drafted the whole way and enjoyed it aplenty, but I'm going with a negative review overall because matches, while intense and fun, are also fairly mentally taxing and when you remember that you get nothing to show for the effort you put in then it does make the prospect of playing another match seem a bit daunting. In other games, playing for the sake of playing would be fine, but a competitive card game needs something to show for your efforts. I'm sure Valve will implement something like this in time, and if they do then I'll likely change this to a positive, but for now I'd avoid unless you really want to sink your teeth into the gameplay itself.
Edit: Balance changes were made and a mockup ranked system is now in game, also now there are 2 tickets and 2 packs obtainable for free each week, up to a total of 15, but they halved the packs you get with the initial purchase, so now the price you pay to play is just ridiculous. Apparently the real issue is just in the monetization model, paying 18 € to play a game where you have to pay for everything else is not viable when competitors give you stuff for free and playing doesn't feel like a chore. Anyway, since my first review, literally nothing changed, even with this patch. The ranked system works in a weird way and you don't usually get matched with the same rank, meta decks are still there, no way to use a hero that's not fucking disgustingly strong, and the exp system to level up your account and get more free packs, is quite fast in the first levels, but since each level needs more point to get to the next, you get to the point that it's not viable. Someone on reddit even made the maths and found out you need a ridiculous amout of time to get to max level, because you get 60-70 points for each win, and like 8\10 for each loss. The real core of the game is really interesting, but the delivery is quite frankly a disaster, looks like valve didn't learn from their mistakes in the past, or worse, is testing the market to see where they could push their greed, but stats show it's not working. Expecting this game to go f2p soon, maybe with its monetization model reworked or something like that, because now to break even with the tickets system you need a 65% winrate, which is possible but for a very limited number of skilled people that can easily go infinite with their 40-50$ decks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game is very fascinating, the gameplay is just one of the best in the genre. Having to distribute properly the resources in your hand is really interesting as a concept, having spells, improvements for the map, creeps, and most importantly, different colors for different kind of playstyles. Summoning a creep or using a spell requires you to have deployed a hero of the same color. Games can last up to 40 minutes because of the intensity, and every choice you make can cost the game. It's a very nice TCG experience and i would totally recommend it. There are 2 different game modes, the Casual and the Expert. Casual is free to play, with different modes, such as a single-game matchmaking with your deck, a Phantom Draft gauntlet where you have to win 5 games in order to complete your run and you can lose up to 2 times, but before joining the matchmaking you have to create a deck drafting random cards out of some packs, and then there's the Constructed gauntlet, with the same 5wins-2defeats as its Draft counterpart but with your deck of choice. Expert is literally the same as Casual, with the only difference you have to pay to partecipate in a gauntlet in order to win some rewards. Basically, the entry fee to play in Expert mode is literally 1€ for every gauntlet, and this honestly is absolutely not viable for the average joe that wants to have some risk in his games. The whole system of Expert mode, to be honest, is bad and leads players to leave the game more and more. Players who are average, finish their tickets fast, and since they don't really win anything from the Expert mode, they'll leave the game, making the stronger guys waste tickets on people who's stronger than them. 

The only game mode that is viable is Phantom draft, both Expert and Casual.

But let's be honest, you play a card game for the constructed experience, you don't want to pay 18€ to play random drafts forever, the real core of the game is creating your deck and testing combos and shit. The problem with the game comes exactly at this point. You're having fun crafting your deck, then every constructed game is dominated by the meta heroes and spells, and every single game is just a random selection in the meta decks pool. The real issue is that this situation is dictated solely by the fact there are only 2 type of cards in this game: trash tier and god tier. God tier cards are expensive, like in any normal TCG, so it's still a "normal" situation. The whole point is, this is a online game, and balancing cards should be a literal change of some variables in the source code (not a programmer but i guess cards stats are hard coded). This lack of balancing is most likely a problem that comes from the monetization system of the game, which in my opinion is the weak point and the main problem that led away most of the playerbase in less than a month since launch. When you have a literal stock market with people investing in axecoins and drowbucks like they're a cryptocurrency, nerfing the strong heroes would just lead whales away, and that's not gonna happen. This game was clearly made to get money, but it's a totally anti-consumer way to do it. Any average player that likes the game, will just be crushed by some rich boy with the best cards, and altough it's true skill beats money, that works only for actually skilled players. 

Spending money for cards, is not that bad per se, every card game requires you to get the cards to play, so in a sense the game is doing what it's supposed to do. But it's not working, and numbers show it. The complete lack of anything remotely player-friendly is encouraging people to leave, once they've finished their 5 starting tickets and are left in the pain of playing constructed vs axe legion forever. 

I wouldn't recommend this game in its current state. There are some features missing like player profile, replay + spectate system, and altough a ranked system is coming next week, i really don't think it's going to fix anything. 

I didn't have high hopes for this game to be honest. When i saw the announcement during TI7 i thought this was complete bullshit and valve fucked up, but i bought it anyway, just to try it out and give my personal opinion on this, and here we go. The core game is incredibly good, but then after you play for 15-20 hours, and start to understand what's going on, you get that the meta is already stale and the game isn't interesting anymore at all. 

The positive side of abandoning this game is that you mostly get back all your money selling the cards without having to refund, which is nice. And also you can't refund because the game almost forces you to open the 10 packs you get with the initial purchase, making it very explicit that you can't refund the moment you decide to take those starting "rewards".
DO NOT BUY THIS.

They will not allow you to refund if you open the card packs.
The ONLY way to get new cards is to pay real money.
Complete scam. cant get my money back and cant do anything unless i spend more money.
Artifact: A great card game, and VALVe's newest child. It flips current online card games on their heads with entirely new ways to go about things. It is not without it's gripes however - I believe the game is amazing in it's state, but being unable to get cards unless you buy packs (literally the *only* way) is a huge turn off, including missing player -> player trading. Market integration is interesting where you can buy any card but they don't control inflation, Axe (a hero) for example is currently ~$20. You can open packs and get heros *that come with the game*.

A lot of these small things ruin constructed, as it's impossible to properly make a deck without buying from the market unless you are absurdly lucky with packs. Some of the things I listed need to change before I can recommend the game, but that is not to say that the game is bad, as it is QUITE the opposite; Artifact is an amazing game in its mechanics, damaged by many small problems.
NEWEST EDIT: DO NOT BUY, VALVE IS NOT GIVING ANY COMMUNICATION OR TELLING COMMUNITY IN WHICH DIRECTION THIS GAME IS GOING, THERE IS NO PLAYERBASE, WAIT FOR UPDATE/REWORK AND THEN SEE IF ANYTHING CHANGED FOR BETTER AND IF IT'S WORTH BUYING, RIGHT NOW YOU ARE BUYING DEAD GAME THAT WILL MAYBE BE REVIVED OR MAYBE NOT WITH UPDATE THAT MAY OR MAY NOT HAPPEN, AS THERE IS ALMOST 0 COMMUNICATION FROM VALVE.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why I can't recommend it, well it is simple, in current state it just doesn't come even close (features/monetazation) to game from where Artifact idea/theme comes from, and if it doesn't improve soon, it will lose almost all playerbase so I hope Valve is reading/listening to feedback and that will act quickly.

Edit: Game was updated, added skill rating (altho it is very bad, skill rating means nothing), seasons, leveling, with leveling you can earn tickets and card packs (seems 15 per season, altho no idea how long season lasts) but sadly at same time they also made 1 thing worse and it is shame (it is like 1 big step forward then 1 step back at same time), [b]buying game used to reward players with 10 packs 5 ticket and now it rewards you with 5 packs and 2 tickets and I think this is big mistake [/b], Valve made some good improvements but with this change they are making game more expensive at start (game that already lacks playerbase, wtf). Then many features are still missing and rewards for ticket modes unchanged, very low, not worth buying ticket for it,  that needs to change (increase rewards for ticket modes) with hopefully some way to get more players like going f2p (letting people play standard modes and if they wanna play prized modes then buy tickets/game) or at least demo (let people try game, 2 tutorial games) that will give players view into game before buying it then I think I will be able to recommend this game.

Artifact is card game based on Dota, runs on same engine, uses almost same interface, if you open Dota and Arifact you will see that menu, options are been copied nicely and that is good but what is not good is that game has been rushed and so many things are missing, I could say that probably just 10% of Dota feautres are in Artifact, some very important features that need to be in Artifact are not here (list of in my opinon features that are missing is posted down in review).

[strike] Valves approach to balancing Artifact (they don't want to balance it)is not good [/strike]. Valve changed their status when it comes to balancing and for better (first balance patch is out) you can read more here https://steamcommunity.com/games/583950/announcements/detail/1714081669510213123
Game has potential, I personaly like draft mode, tournaments feature is nice allowing players to create their own tournaments also there are auto tournaments created by game, and there is huuuge space for improvements and that can be looked as good and as bad thing, it's bad because space is there because game feels like early access, beta, but if Valve works on it, it can become very nice game full of many great features.

[strike] You are here buying and expecting to buy more in order to keep playing (you do have few modes to play for free but no rewards), no ladder/MMR of any sort, no any kind of way to "earn" cards or ticket to play drafts with rewards (there should be some way to let player earn ticket even if it's 1 per week) [/strike] Since last update there is progression and bad skill rating sytem, leveling that rewards you for playing with rewards like card packs or tickets, however one thing still stands when it comes to rewards for ticket modes. they are low, not really worth buying ticket, just getting even, getting ticket back is very hard, you need 3 wins for ticket back, 2 wins will reward you nothing (half ticket would be nice / 10 random common cards, you can recycle 20 for 1 ticket), rewards needs to be increased, and when it comes to effects, nothing special, you don't even see "big bang" effects when you claim rewards (compared to other card games)

[b]As far as features go, as I said there are so many that they could copy from Dota yet they didn't, so here is what is missing in my opinion (Dota-like features):[/b]

1. [strike]No progression , or some kind of ladder.[/strike]  (added skill rating but this solution after some playime feels useless, game still lacks proper good ranked mode, mmr and leaderboards,  seasons and leveling system system that rewards you with packs/tickets are ok, 15 ticket/packs per season)
2. Region/custom/[strike]ingame chat [/strike] (ingame chat added) 
3. Better friends/chat ui that doesn't involve steam overlay,
4. Spectate mode (Dota has DotaTV, CSGO has CSGOTV) with filters for friends/top games/or compared to Dota where we can filter to find games with specific hero, in Artifact it would be nice to filter for colors. 
5. Replays and match history (there is no match history with stats, wtf) are one of most important feautres that are missing.
6. Profile UI with stats and comments and match history
7. checking opponent ingame profile and stats
8. [strike]Adding[/strike] (you can try to add opponent after game)
9. There could be even twitch/steam.tv embed somewhere with option to hide/show that remembers your option choice.
10. Game is not free 2 play, tickets are used for modes with rewards, but as I said rewards are low, just feels not worth it, wait to change, ask for change.
11. Many players suggested demo for game if it's not going f2p (standard modes only f2p), let people play tutorial (2 games), let people try game before buying it.

And some in my opinion not Dota-like features that should be in Artifact:

Hearthstone-like collection view.
Drafting against friends 1v1. 
Events (HS-like weekly brawl that rewards with something even f2p players).

[b]Menu optimization is improved but still very intensive compared to ingame performance, I hope they are still working on optimization and as far as menu goes, it could use 1 more Dota like system option that can improve performance on low-mid end pc - "low quality dashboard".[/b] (This might help little bit, https://steamcommunity.com/app/583950/discussions/0/1741101364283976160/)

This game atm is very demanding, harder to run than Dota (same engine, same UI), and this is card game for card game one would expect way better performance, I have no idea how they plan to make this game run on mobile (they said it will come to mobile early-mid 2019)
I hope I will see some updates aimed to improve performance.

Also as always Valve is silent on all fronts (no advertising, blog, no community manager, twitter is little bit active for now), I don't care that Valve is known for their "silent work", it is time for change, silence doesn't work in every single situation, Valve needs to talk to playerbase, let us know what are your plans, road map (what feautres can we expect down the road), something...

I hope they are at least working on something, game is losing players. (Also once again my review leans towards not recommended but after all improvements I can see light at end of tunnel, game needs more improvements, and I don't see reason for $20 paywall with already ticket paywall ingame for drafts and extra card paywall for constructed, it is multiplayer game it should go f2p (standard modes only), also more features (Dota-like menu features) before I can recommend game)
Don't buy it. Terrible economy model, pay-to-pay-to-win structure, drawn out gameplay where a strong start will decide the match. Man do I regret the purchase.
I'm guessing it'll be free in a couple of months anyways. What an awful money leak.
You'll have to be totally committed and put money into this for it to feel even remotely fair or fun.
Play literally any other free-to-play card game if you're looking to have fun without paying your way to the top.

The gameplay mechanics are fresh and interesting, but the economy spoils any potential enjoyment. Get ready to lose!
I did two tutorial matches, and hit next through the 'congratulations for finishing the tutorial' modal.
Which apparently unboxed an in game consumable without my knowledge.
Which disqualifies me from requesting a refund.
Shady as shit, Valve.
Worst Valve game ever.

First of all wouldn't refund as I had apparently opened the tutorial packs (you have to accept otherwise it freezes), yet there were unopen. 

Secondly, it is major pay to win. It says "matching with your skill level", yet these players have Axe, Legion Commander etc and are pro's.

Thirdly, there is a very big learning curve that has put a lot of people off. The ranking system does not work either. I would highly advise against buying this game. It should have been free like Hearthstone, although thats pay to win - at least it doesn't charge you at the beginning!
STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.  Shady AF.

Steam has a refund policy for any game you purchase through steam.  If you play it less than 2 hours and have not had it for more than 14 days you can qualify for a refund for said game.

This shady game states the money goes toward in game items.  Even tho when you look at the purchase history for the game it states you paid $19.99 for the Artifact game and $0.00 for the starter pack.  They will deny you a refund because of the starter pack being opened even tho you're directed to open the starter pack and were given the starter pack for free.

After that hogwash, you must continue to dump money into the game to stay competitive.  The microtransaction scheme is about as much pay to win as you can be.

I do not recommend anyone try this game until they stop the flagrant abuse of steams refund policy.  Run very far away from this game until that happens or you will see more and more games try to circumvent the refund policy with shady practices.
I cannot reccomend this game.
After paying close to 30SGD, you do not get the full game.
Instead, you pay 30SGD to be told that you do not have access to the entire game.
There is NO FREE WAY to earn card packs; the only way up is by spending money.

Too Long; Didn;t Read
DOTA 2 is great because its a free to play model. 
Artifact is bad because it is a Pay to Win model.
I really wanted to like this game, especially after all the hype from Pax Prime 2018 where I won a local tournament (i.e. I got a beta key). However, this game is a money sink. After playing quite a few hours in beta, I've determined it's impossible to win pretty much any games in conctructed without spending $$$, unless you're lucky and get paired with another non-spender . 

I was hoping this game would un-throne Hearthstone, and that I could switch my attention over to this. But alas, I don't think I will. In Hearthstone I can pre-order each expansion and F2P gold throughout the year to have a pretty complete collection. Blizzard entices me into spending money by making me feel like I can still earn cards without spending money. But with Artifact, I don't see the value of putting any money into this game, as there is no way to earn cards. Yes, that's right... there is currently no F2P elements or progression for playing. I'm disappointed; I think this game could top Hearthstone if the developers would add F2P elements. I would jump ship for sure!

On a positive note though, where this game shines is draft mode, especially since the playing field is evened. I do wonder though about the longevity of this mode. I fear it will grow stale and my interest will wane (since who knows how long until an expansion will pop). 

Valve-- if you read these reviews-- please add F2P elements so players can earn cards. I switched to Hearthstone from MTG for a reason...I don't want to be a whale.
So after playing this game all I can say is wow, simply wow. This game is so Pay to win it makes me sick and I will explain.
First things first, besides the cards you get in the begining, you must either sell your cards to purchase new ones or spend real money. Outside of that their is no in game currency or method to earn packs by simply playing. They give you "tickets" which you can use to play an arena mode, if your familiar with hearthstone its like that, but you only get 10 tries. During that if you lose twice your out and need 3 wins just to earn the ticket back, problem is you will be facing people with op cards and I will further explain.

People will say that you can play draft and that it isn't pay to win, BS after you draft it allows you to add cards that you have to the draft and swap them WHICH COMPLETELY DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF DRAFT.
Don't buy this game, it uses the skin of Dota 2 to lure fans and cover a sea of microtransactions, this is not worth the full price I paid. I think Valve knew this as well as they even go the extra mile to make sure that once you realize this you cannot get your refund as is stated and I quote, "Refunds: Once you've claimed your Starter Decks and Card Packs you will be ineligible for an automatic refund of Artifact via Steam. Before claiming your Starter Decks and Card Packs, you will be able to play games against bots and other players using pre-constructed decks."

Thats like right after the tutorial why would you give players free cards and say if you open them, too bad so sad no refund for you, that is so idiotic, seriously what were you thinking !?!

In conclusion I cannot reccomend this game, it was fun don't get me wrong, but the pay to win and overflowing microtransactions with the game ruin it.
Pretty sweet game with a God-aweful economy. Basically pay for everything...

The game itself is freaking amazing, it has to be the best strategy CCG I played. It's deep, complex, engaging. 

But the way you can't earn anything for free, and have to pay for absolutely everything is a huge deal breaker for me.
Wanted to refund this game but since I opened the packs you got with it you're not eligible for a refund. Thanks for abusing your own system Valve, you money hoarding greedy bastards. The Valve of old days are truly dead.

[h1] You walk into a store to buy a shirt [/h1]
You wanna buy a new shirt. You find a nice, good looking shirt. You go to the store and you buy the said shirt for 17,95. To your surprise, as you walk out of the store, you find out that the shirt, is ripped apart, and you only got a piece of it. It is at that point, that a salesman approches you and tells you that if you want the other parts of the shirt, you have to give more money, to them, or to other random customers that have bought the same shirt and they've got the parts that you don't have, and they are willing to sell them. After that, he lets you know that, you can't actually wear the shirt, and you have to pay, a "ticket" price, every time you wanna wear it.
Yes, this is sarcasm, and maybe not the best analogy, but still, too much f-king money to play the game, buying cards/packs on a card game is one thing, buying the actual game that actually gives you close to nothing, and having to pay event tickets to enter the actual ranked game modes, is a whole other topic.
This game has promise.

That said, don't buy it. It's a mess currently. The amount of RNG in this game is staggering, it makes Hearthstone look like a good game. Now if you play TCGs you'll know that managing RNG from draws and resources is par for the course. It's literally the bread and butter of deck construction. Minimizing bad outcomes and maximizing good ones. However this game has 4 layers of RNG, all of which work against eachother to make preparing a winning boardstate almost entirely a matter of chance and very little skill.

The 4 layers of RNG are 

Your spell deck
Your Item deck
Your lane placements
Your arrow placements

How do we prevent ourselves from being fucked in other games? Well we build a good deck with a good resource curve and a win condition, then we fill out our deck with ways to get our win condition on the board, OR survive long enough to get our win condition on the board. We can do that in this game, for the most part. We can still get bad luck and draw cards we don't need or can't play, but that's ok, we're used to that RNG that's part of deck building.

Now you also have an item deck, you put 9 cards, they show up in the shop in random order, hopefully you have the resources to play them when they show up. Maybe you won't. Maybe you won't see the item you need. Same kind of thing as above, however these compound as one of your items may be part of your win condition. AND the resource generation for this deck is based in... ANOTHER LAYER OF RNG.

Lane deployments! Your first turn your heroes go to what are essentially random lanes. I honestly can't remember if the 1/2/3 order puts them in left middle right, or if they just randomly get assigned to a lane, However it doesn't matter since you don't actually get to see what heroes the enemy is fielding before the decision is made, so they're essentially random anyways. You don't know where the turn 1 creeps are going, and you have no option to perhaps double up heroes in 1 lane and sac a lane. You also don't have your cards drawn at this point either so you wouldn't be able to make an informed decision about what spells you have when deciding lanes. Then at the same time Creeps are sent to the lanes randomly. Enjoy that. Do you have a hero who buffs creeps? well he might be alone. he may NEVER get creeps in his lane. Sure there are cards that create creeps, but that's another layer of RNG of course. Now, Depending on how the game matched up your heroes and creeps in lanes, 1 or 2 of 4 situations will occur in each lane. You'll have a hero vs a hero, your hero vs their creep, their hero vs your creep, or creep vs creep. Depending on how this Randomly assigned lane organization plays out in each lane, you may just lose a hero on your first turn, giving the enemy a gold advantage. Maybe you drew into a 1/2/3 cost card of the color of your hero that needs it, but maybe you didn't. Anyways now you have no gold, and your enemy has some. Turn 2 comes around! They buy items, you don't. Welp snowballing has already occured, and now it's time for RNG 4.

The arrows! you get to deploy your 4th hero, Maybe you're putting in to a lane to replace a hero, or into a lane to support another hero. Who knows! Well one thing you do know, you won't get to choose where in the lane it goes! You just send it to a lane and hope it ends up where you want it to. And you also hope that it is attacking the thing you want it to. YAY more RNG. Sure there are spells that will move arrows, or move units. However they're rare, there are 2-3 effects that swap units, and under 10 that change attack targets accross all 4 colors. Sure it's set 1, but this is a HUGE part of the game. Hope you draw into them, oh btw arrows reset after things die. hope you get an advantageous 2nd arrow.

If you're still reading at this point, know that I've been playing card games for 30 years at a highly competitve level. I have no problem with the draw RNG inherent in deckbuilding games. However these layers of RNG compound on eachother to take away any and all agency you as a player should have. That is why I cannot recommend this game despite how excited I was for it.

I should point out, I only ever write reviews for games that I care about. There are plenty of other games out there that I hate, that I silently just uninstall. This game could be amazing, however currently it's not worth your time, let alone your money. You'd be better off sinking quarters in a slot machine Less RNG.
Not being able to earn cards without paying money or useing the market. is the biggest reason i cant reccomend this game. its super fun and really fresh but its just half a game even if you pay the 18 euro it asks its no where near enough to play for real.
1 - game already dead for those who play just for fun.
2 - the game itself became totally p2w.
3 - can't get cards/tickets without paying real money.(lvl system is pure sh*t)
4 - the random stuff, its really annoying.
5 - broken cards.
6 - no refund (didnt like it? F yourself).

spend your money on meth, more healthy.
This game is good.
I have spent nearly all my hours in Draft and I really enjoy the mechanics, but if you are thinking that this will be something to replace Hearthstone or MTG Arena you are dead wrong.
Let’s get it out of the way, the monetization is indeed flawed, the only way you obtain cards is via your own money being sucked into Gabe Newels wallet, passing right by the grave of Gordon Freeman.

Progression
Every game you win and play will feel unrewarded and just a waste of time. There is no reason to play. You don’t get anything at all for playing any match other than Expert play which is just casual mode where you pay real money to have a chance at winning anything rewarding. There is no XP, no ranking system and no virtual currency (or arcane dust) earned through winning.

Heroes and Balance
There a lot of low tier heroes and a select few A or God tier heroes, now there being strong cards in a Card Game is not an issue, but this on top of the progression and monetization really ruins this game. Axe (a good hero card) at the time of this review is on the market for $31… Annihilation (A board wipe card) is $10… soo if you want to just outright buy the cards then hope you’re willing to drop $100 on your deck.

Card Packs and the Luck of the Draw
You can get cards in these card packs that come for free with the base game, so essentially you have a chance to get cards that have no value. The packs themselves are just too expensive ($2.50 or like $2.80 if you’re in the AU), yes they cost the same as a regular tcg games card packs but when I buy a regular card pack of let’s say Pokémon, I get a physical item. I’m getting an item here that cannot be traded and can’t be used in any other way than to play this game; while other virtual card games do the same most of those games are free 2 play.

Tldr
Bad monetization, no progression and no reason to buy this game.
I honestly can't stand scrolling through my collection and seeing $ values to all my cards. 

And, it might actually be cheaper to buy everything in Artifact, compared to buying everything in any other card game.

But theres never going to be a point where I just play the game, and don't worry about the $ value of cards.
About 100 hours in now. can't say that I am a veteran, but can't say I didn't give it a shot, either.
The pay-to-play-aspect didn't bother me too much in draft. Usually I make enough packs to recycle cards/sell cards for tickets and be playing endlessly, more or less. The inital price is justified thinking about how much time I could genuinely spend on the game.

Drafting was a lot of fun for a while, but now that I have explored the process, the novelty fades. 
The endless RNG is becoming frustrating. 
Slowly farming booster packs isn't incentive enough to cover this up for me.
Getting 3 very bad drafts in a row, losing a highly favored game to cheating death and I must say: I've had it for now.

Haven't gotten behind the paywall for constructed yet, but watching streamers I get the impression that this mode has some serious issues. I won't spend the extra money just to try it.


I think the game has a lot of potential, but for now I must answer the question
"Does my life quality improve from spending time on Artifact?"
with a clear "No".

I'll have more time for more fun things now.

heartstone introduced me to the wonders of ccg/tcg. been an infinite arena player since the closed beta but stopped since 2 years ago due to getting bored of stalled/uninteresting/recycled game mechanics.  Artifact in comparison is a very refreshing game due to slightly more complex and deeper gameplay and deck building, which is what a lot of hardcore hearthstone players were asking for.

my core game mode is phantom draft (pretty much like hs arena but with more choices and freedom) so the points I'll make will be making will reflect only on that mode unless otherwise mentioned. I've spent 50ish hours on phantom draft as of this review is written. 

- gameplay wise, i am not too sure about how i feel about it. i dont hate it but i dont like it either. I have mixed feelings about it. I've hated the fact that you cant position the heroes and choose the targets during deployment which takes away the sense of control from you. yes i am aware of you can pick the lanes you want to drop your heroes onto, i am talking about the positions not lanes. in which i think this is the most annoying game mechanics of the game. There are simply too much RNG is dictating the core part of the game, more so on phantom draft mode since you cant exactly draft all your dream cards, you have to make do with what you have. often, you just lost the run without even playing due to crappy/fragile heroes and crappy rng during the first few deployments which put you into massive disadvantages due to your opponent having a lot more gold than you. 

- balancing wise, i cant say i am well versed about all the cards and meta but it feels like red and green are simply too good in phantom draft mode while black is the average. blue is the worst in term of raw stats. blue is simply too conditional and hard to extremely hard to survive early game. 

- incentive/progression/rewards - as of right now, it feels lacking the thrills/incentive to keep playing due to the lack of progression and actual reward. while one might argue that casual modes are free, but for me, it also lack of the thrills due to the fact that you get nothing in return. in short, a player can just abandon as many draft as you like until you get the perfect draft where everyone have the insane draft, which is kind of defeating the purpose of a draft mode.

- the fear of spending money without getting anything back. i think this is very similar with starcraft 2 ladder fear, players are afraid of losing rank and discouraging weaker/newer players from trying hence making the paid modes even harder since those who dare and will spend money on the tickets are usually already kinda good at these modes further alienating new/weaker players to try these modes. the cycles will only get worse and worse, eventually there will be very little players on these modes. i think the current model is simply not sustainable in the long run, business and players number wise. 

-User interface wise, the UI overall is usable but not exactly polished, the hand is quite difficult to navigate especially when you have a lot of cards, they simply clumped together, browsing and picking cards from your hand become really difficult especially on tournament mode where the time constraints are much shorter. the auto camera zoom is very annoying as well. 

- Monetization wise, It has the worst forms of monetization packed into a single game. 
Pay to play ✅ 
Pay per play (tickets) ✅ 
Pay for lootboxes (packs) ✅ 

- will update when i've more to rant/add. hopefully it will be a positive review then. i kind of enjoyed the game, but i am not too sure i am willing to continue playing it in the long run.
I've played a lot of card games, physical and digital and so I come from a position of a reasonable understanding of how their systems work and compare. Artifact has a unique system to replicate a MOBA as a card game, the hero cards keeping modifications, the respawns, the item shops in between turns, all thematically fit well with the game. 

Despite being interesting thematically, the game really suffers from its monetization scheme and overreliance on RNG to makes the game more than a number crunch. The idea of a digital TCG where the cards have real value from supply scarcity is good in theory, but Valve appears terrified of deflating the value over time. There is zero way in game for players to get more cards without paying, making the game feel like a microtransaction cash grab. The worst example of this is the arena system in Artifact which costs tickets (money) to participate in and only gives rewards past a three win threshold, I'm struggling to think of another card game with as stingy a reward system. 

Arena/Draft modes are usually played by two types of players, new players who want to experience new cards and find out what they like while expanding their collection, and Spikes who want to optimize their strategy to go infinite. The current system only allows Spikes to feel satisfied, as a newcomer to the game will not be able to get to that three win mark to get new cards, despite the run costing money. 

Hearthstone is notoriously bad for its RNG, with cards like pre-nerf Yogg turning competitive matches into coin flips on the spot. Artifact is worse. You can argue that many decisions are made post RNG so skilled players can minimize it's effects, but with the inherent RNG of card games (drawing cards) along with Artifact's additional randomized systems, it's past reasonable to say this is a skill based game. What this translates to is in game games being heavily affected, and sometimes determined by RNG factors that players have little to no control over, the targeting system, the creed spawn system, the initial hero spawns, the item shop contents, many of the cards using % chances of working, it's all too much. 

Can't say I recommend this game, as someone who really likes and enjoys a range of card games for their systems and various skill levels required Artifact just feels bad to play.
Fun for one hour. Then you realize you're stuck with the same RANDOM cards you get when you first play the game (unless you make further purchases). In a PvP game, having the ability to pick and choose is kind of important.

Stay far away from this game.
The good:

It's not Heartstone


The bad:

The multiple lane mechanic isn't very engaging, you usually end up abandoning 1 lane and focusing on two and even with just two lanes it feels like games drag on for a lot longer than they should.

While a lot of new ccg's try to move away from rng by giving ways to minimize it, Artifact doubled down on it, it doesnt give the ability to mulligan and stuffed a lot of dicerolls and coinflips in the core game mechanics while lacking much of the flair other rng heavy cardgames have, making it more tedious than fun to deal with. 

Constructed seems very stale due to the limited amount of cards and very pay to win due to the price of cards being tied to the steam market instead of a set value.

There is little hero or card  balance, in other ccg's most cards can atleast fill some niche role but in artifact a lot of them are utterly useless and some are just weak versions of a rare more expensive alternative to push players to spend money on the market.

The game seems more like a multi layered poker probability exercise than a tactical ccg, the overall mechanics design feels awful. This might have been a nice game 2 decades ago when all it would have to compete with was Mtg, but when compared with the other ccg's out there, that perform a lot better in pretty much every aspect, this game is just not worth it.
*EDIT* - Made this review before the Dec 20th patch. I had only played 2.2 hours and they rejected my refund request. I'll keep playing the game, so if I have more hours played, I'm just giving it another shot. Hope valve made some good changes.

My review will consist of my rejected refund request.

PS - Discovered there's an in game warning I missed - https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/jXLVk5Rp_TVIkjW7GiD6tQhiEszECwSt428QKlR4IuY/https/i.imgur.com/mAEjzq1.png

Unfortunate for me I guess, that's far too dim to see on my screen. Usually this kind of thing would have a "Warning:" or a red font to indicate it's something worth reading, not the least important, dimmest, most unique (only used once) font on the entire page, on a page full of standout text, a page that's usually just to acknowledge your received a pre-order bonus, a page that's usually skippable, not usually an "I Agree" type page... but I digress...


"I'm sorry to be another one of those people but this game model just isn't acceptable for me.

I don't want to play a game where once I run out of tickets I can't progress in any way without paying real money, and that's what this game is. That's not what I understood when I signed up. There aren't even objectives outside of competitve play (some gated with pay access), and meaningless play. If there's only competitive play and absolutely no method of collecting anything in the game, Ithis is basically just a pay to win gacha, and I wouldn't sign up for it now, or continue to participate when more seasons/cards come out.

I didn't use my event tickets, and I only played one online game and a piece of another before quitting and realizing it isn't for me. Sorry I reached 2.2 hours, I spent a lot of the time reading and looking around. Please help me out on this one, you can see from my history I'm a good steam customer I don't refund or complain often.

Thanks."
casual player/non competitive are better playing quick/draft mode game

serious player/competitive should spend a lot of money to stay relevant in ranked

a bit sad i cant get refund because 2 hours to me is just like a basic tutorial and remembering some of deck list that the game provided

but i still can get some steam wallet back by selling some of rare card that i get (mostly because duplicate, lol)

i wouldnt recommend it for people who like to build deck without spending money to buy card pack on this game, unless if they just want to play casually (which i think probably they would stay away from artifact and keep playing other free-to-play (or free to grind LOL) card game)
I've have been using steam for 10 years and this is the first product I feel have really tried to screw me with its marketing and information when bying the product.

The tutorial felt good and were well done. The gameplay seems intresting. I open my 5 packs packs and think OK now I'm gonna get into this! I test out a couple of bot matches to realize that they give 0 xp of progression. Ok, well then I'll try test my newly aquired skills against som fellow players. Getting matched with only people 15-25 lvls higher then me. The turn timer is really short and stressful. And of course I do lose since i dont have any cards. Well thats learning the hard way I guess. No hard feelings. But...

Losing games have rewarded me with between 8-16 xp. You need 500 to level up to level 2 which grant you the 1st reward that I have already PAID for. So I have to lose ~40 matches to get my first already PAID for pack? WTF... One match is at least 15 min. So to progress as a newbie I have to spend around 10h losing against people that are 20 lvls higher than me to get my first tiny pack that I have paid for. I have purchased a lot of Early access titles and those are a bit of a gamble. But they mostly lacking gameplay or have a little more bugs than usual. Thats what you expect. But bying an premium title from no other company than Valve with the marketing of unlocking most of the things I paid for being force to spend countless of hours of scewed gameplay (you need lvl 16 to unlock all pre paid rewards). THAT'S JUST HOAX.

Most normal companies have pre paid content unlocked through the tutorial/getting familiar with the client. To get he things I've paid for in this title I have to switch to full Vanilla WoW grind. The is unacceptable.

I'm VERY disappointed. No other game with forced gameplay to unlock PAID content expect you to grind 100+ hours. That is nothing but a scam. I have to WORK for what I have already PAID for. I have better things to do. You are prompted to open the packs after the tutorial so no refund is available. That is NOT the problem. The problem is HOAX marketing. I have never run into another game that have pre paid content unlocked by 100+ hours of scewed matchmaking losing to unlock your stuff. Get yourself together Valve. This is not only silly, but a VERY unserious way of selling and marketing your products.
Really nice play modes and competitive game. Awesome mechanics, but no progression system, no way of earning new cards without money and no ladder. 

Not recommended in its current form.
such a disgusting feeling when you lose your last 'free' ticket without winning a single booster)) uninstalled at the same moment. im not good for this game.
Artifact doesn't go out its way to utilize the digital aspects of card games, instead clinging onto the old ways of physical trading card games. Instead of buffing or nerfing existing cards, they plan to fix balancing issues by selling new card sets and make the old ones obsolete via set-rotations, much like Magic the Gathering. While there are benefits to doing things this way, some of the reasons are heavily rooted in its monetization scheme. Nerfs would mean instant loss of value, which can be unfair to people spending hundreds of dollars to assemble constructed decks. Many areas of Artifact's design seem stiff, afraid to stray too far from a formula that "works", no matter how flawed.

Even Artifact's drafting mode, which is no doubt the most enjoyable way to play the game currently, is held-back by a lack of innovation. Drafting is currently nothing more than selecting cards, 2 at a time, from cycling booster packs until you've got enough to build a deck: then queue up for a gauntlet via matchmaking. Drafting heroes is really cumbersome: each time you pick one, you're locked out from picking an additional hero until the next round of picks. With only 5 rounds, and 5 heroes, that often means you'll get stuck with a weak or unfitting hero.

Fortunately the gameplay itself is quite promising. A lot of people think it's "Hearthstone with 3 lanes" at a glance, but that could not be farther from the truth. I've played a lot of different TCG/CCGs: MTG, Hex, Yugioh, Pokemon, Gwent, Hearthstone, Solforge, etc. and I can safely say that it is the most complex and mechanically-deep card game I've played so far. The multiple lanes add a level of decision-making that isn't seen in any other card game. There is a lot of room for mind-games and planning due to how the turns work. Also rule text on cards is thoroughly explained with tooltips and detailed descriptions, which is something I think a lot of modern card games are severely lacking.

Ultimately, at the end of the day, it's just a card game with a Dota 2 theme. I wouldn't say that Artifact is a particularly special experience, but if you're really into card games it's worth checking out for the free drafting mode. The $20 pricetag might seem steep, but you can sell your cards on the marketplace and potentially get your money back. Just don't expect to be able to grind or unlock cards, it's not that kind of game. If you want to build a collection and play constructed format, expect to spend at least $100 if you want to run a top-tier deck. While this is very standard for a card-game, it seems rather unacceptable for a digital game to be this expensive.

I could see myself changing this review to a thumbs up some day, but right now the game just feels very lackluster. The current set (Call to Arms) is very small, and you see the same few cards used over and over again. There's no match statistics or game records, there's no spectator mode to watch my friends play, no achievements, and no progression system (like unlocking cosmetics). Once they add some new sets and spice things up, I'm sure it'll feel like a lot more complete experience.
pay to pay to play, very good game if you only judge on the game play, however the business model is little weird and unacceptable to many, feels like a gambling in draft where you can get owned by noob just having better cards even if you are better than them. Eventually you will start feeling discouraged from playing or wants to dump more money to win it back, I think it's a never ending paywall in the end since you will always end up dumping more money in, not to mention if you want get your ticket back, you have to reach a 75% win rate at first. Which imo is ridiculously high. I wish the business model was purely base on cosmetic and cards are made free available to anyone, that way it's all about skill and not getting stuck behind cards, or free ways to get cards, yeah true card values get lower but check the price right now, it's super cheap anyways in the first place, common/uncommons are around 0.06 to 0.1. Time of trimph already at $5, sooner or later they will drop even further. There is very low value in the first place, I will dump more money if they add cosmetic, for example animated heroes/special animations/foil and etc.
Also you can compare to HS all you want, but this model imo is a little better than HS, at least 
you can get some value back in your cards, I say people comparing this to HS is not seeing the real issue, the real issue is that trading card game in general is a money sucker, it is the whole genre to blame, gamers should be aware that this whole genre's payment mode is niche and totally not f2p friendly. However, doesn't mean it shouldn't be changed or challenged.
Much more than just a bad game: this is definitive proof that Valve's corporate culture and flat hierarchy are failed experiments.

You were once capable of greatness, Valve. You can't just keep buying projects that are already successful, chewing the teams up and spitting them out after they release a single product with your logo on it.

Reorganize your company, re-hire the people with creative vision, and make real games again, please.
I've never seen a game with such strong qualities that I resented so much.  As a long-time fan of HL, Portal, Dota2 and also as a TCG player (MTG, LoTRTCG) I am bitterly frustrated with Artifact.  Seriously, this PAINS my heart, Volvo - its a broken a$$ game.

TL:DR - Gaben, give your loyal followers 10 free non-tradeable tickets a month so we can play the only fun, fair and balanced mode of this game (expert draft) because we are already paying the upfront cost AND paying for the cards AND paying for tickets.  Fix the random creep spawn mechanic because the game as it is has nothing to do with skill and everything to do with what lanes you randomly get creeps in and who has the bigger wallet.  Also, please add some scoreboards and stats and let us trade the cards.  Do that and we will recommend!  Dayum.  Until these changes are made I'm not wasting anymore time/money on it.

PROS:
- The game is smooth and looks good.  The music is great.  
- You can find the information you need with ease; For example, double click a card that says it has 'Siege' and hover the mouse over the word and it will tell you what 'Siege' does.  User friendly.  
- Fun mechanices.  You take turns batteling in 1 of 3 lanes.  There are items like blink dagger that allow you to swap lanes and of course a lot (not all) of the heroes and items reflect the DOTA universe.  To win you have to take 2 enemy towers OR 1 enemy tower and the ancient that spawns after it.  There's an item shop to visit between each round.  You play with 5 heroes per deck and each hero has its own special cards that automatically come with the hero.  (Though I think it's bullsh!t you are allowed to use two of the same hero in drafts.)
- The premise is genuinely awesome and the mechanics are really cool, and DOTA heroes abound (not all of them in game yet).  This could be a REALLY fun game.  It's MUCH better than that simplistic Hearthstone, no offense to fans.

CONS:
- There are TWO HUGE problems that need fixing before I can recommend the game.

1. THE ON-GOING COST:  (And I don't mean the cost of buying cards, or the upfront cost of the game, I mean the on-going cost to keep playing!)  
- When I first heard people complaining I was rolling my eyes thinking, it's a Trading Card Game, what do you expect?  The cost of a pack of Artifact cards is much less than the cost of cards you'd walk in to buy from a store, so who cares, right?  ...I was wrong.  There really is a problem.  You are getting tri-taxed to play the game.  
- You pay the upfront price of the game which is currently $19.99.  Okay, I'll pay that for the production value and because it's based on DOTA, and you get some cards with the purchase.  (Half, if not all, of the heroes don't even use their real voices from the game.  Maybe that's a pet-peeve but ... come on, you know we're buying this because we want to play a card game with our beloved DOTA heroes!!!!!!)   Anyway, that's $19.99 just to have the ability to play.
- Next there's the cost to buy cards and let's face it, in a Magic the Gathering (MTG) based trading card game you have to buy better cards to play better.  I wish they'd considered a more complex, strategic and solid game base, like LoTRTCG by Decipher, inc.  MTG *always* comes down to the most expensive deck wins.  But hey, MTG is still fun in spite of that.  So again I thought, okay, I'll just sell my crap duplicates and some of the rares I'm not building around and use that to buy the ones I need.  
- Then the sucker punch - YOU HAVE TO BUY ADDITIONAL TICKETS TO PLAY.  Now, you can play with friends without purchasing tickets, you can play for free with bots (who does that?), you can play casually without tickets, but you don't win anything, you aren't tallying up stats or a score, and its not like you can pull your deck out of the computer to go play with a bunch of buddies next door and you CANT TRADE THE CARDS.  If you play constructed you face someone who paid for super cards which you may not be able to afford and you lose, so that's out.  
- That leaves expert draft mode as the only fun and balanced mode of play (Casual draft without the ticket price has nothing to win, no stats, and is boring).  In expert draft each player starts with random cards and builds a deck out of them so its fair and balanced and fun.  But for this you have to buy a ticket to play.  So yes, the cost is a real problem.

2. RANDOM BUTTFVCKERY:  You might as well be paying to flip a coin.  The killing blow is rarely a matter of skill and who held onto what cards at the right time and who chose the right cards together.  With MTG its a matter of lucky shuffel and expensive rares.  With Artifact, its FAR WORSE.
- It literally DOES NOT MATTER how smart you play or how well you build your deck, the killing blow will be determined by the random number of creeps that spawn.  You can be poised to take someone's tower for the FIFTH TIME IN A ROW and the game will continue to spawn 3 random creeps for that person in that lane and you can ARTFULLY DEAL WITH THEM EACH FREAKING TIME and it will STILL JUST SPAWN MORE CREEPS FOR THEM.  But after 11 FVCKING rounds after you've exhausted everything to defend your other lanes while it keeps rescuing your opponent, it will then randomly SPAWN NONE FOR YOU.  This can happen to your benefit as well and you will sit there with a SH!T EATING GRIN about how you were really screwed but got 3 random creeps and then won....until you play again and it happens to you.
- The point - its frustrating and it sucks!  You might as well take your dollar for the ticket price and buy a lottery ticket instead.  There literally is NO skill and the winning blow is LITERALLY a matter of luck.  To want us to pay to play, after already charging us for cards and the start up cost, for a random-win game, is just too stupid.  

FIX:  Valve, I can recommend this game and its upfront cost AND its additional costs if you please 1. add some dang stats and other features to give us something to achieve in it or give us the ability to TRADE the cards and 2. please give players 10 non-tradeable tickets a month... (even if they expire when the month ends).  Make these monthly hand-outs non-tradeable and non-sellable to preserve the market of the game and the rarity, but please give us something.  Right now we are paying TRICE to play and there is no incentive and no way to earn new cards without paying yet again.  If I knew I could have a few shots at expert draft every week or so (again the only mode that's fun), I would be much more likely to play and spend money to build a better deck (even though it doesn't really matter).  I think the best solution is to keep your starter price for the game, but give us a certain number of free plays each month (non-tradeable tickets).  If I want to play above and beyond that, fine, charge me for another ticket, but you gotta give us some ability to play and have fun here ...especially for the upfront costs and microtransactions we're giving you, and the fact that skill means nothing in this game.
The worst buy I made last year, for sure.

Not only is the game devoid of any progression or anything to earn you cards (at least at launch, it seems they added it now, too little too late for me though), but it's also a very complex, high-skill game where SO many decisions you make across a single game have so much impact on its outcome, that half the time I don't know what I could've done right unlike other games such as Hearthstone, shadowverse, hell even magic.

If you're a casual card game player, avoid this like the plague.

Biggest regret of 2018.
Pay 2 Play garbage. Not only did they give beta players the game for free they also allowed them to unload all their rare cards before the market was available to everyone. They got ot sell their cards for $50 while we can at most get $15 out of the same card now. 

Valve scammed every single person who preordered with this.

Hopefully this game dies within a year so they can start to work on HL3. 

This is pay to win and pay to play scam.
13 hours in, and the cards balance is absolute garbage. The game is literally pay to win, so there's no way a free player can enjoy this game fully. Match is about 30 min long, and you cant redraw your beginning hand. Not really recommended for free player.
Very bad optimization. The game has 10-20 fps on the minimum settings and low resolution, while my PC not just meets the minimum requirements, but surpasses them. I am able to play CS GO and Dota2 on minimum settings, but not Artifact. I cannot imagine how this game can be playable on phones and tabs with a such bad optimization. I really hope they will fix this, as the game is good. Until that I cannot recommend it, if you want to play on laptop or a PC with an integrated / budget videocard.
As a Valve game, we expect a good game. And that's one, as long as you pay.

Easy to learn, hard to master. Do not worry, the two tutorials of the game make us perfectly understand the basic mechanics. Then, the game invites you to open your pre-built decks, then to discover your boosters: you agree to waive the refund of the game.

Once your boosters are opened, you can play all the game modes. And that’s where you see the biggest problem of the game.
[list][*]Do you want to play with your custom deck? You can build it only with the cards you own.
[*]Do you want a new card (via a card booster)? You have to pay, and you are not sure which cards you will receive.
[*]Do you want a particular card? Go to the community market, and pay.
[*]Do you want a ticket to try to win a reward? Take out your credit card.
[*]There is simply no way to earn free cards (no reward system, no daily login bonus, no community challenge, nothing).[/list]

Yes, you can win boosters by participating in runs. However, the ratio required to win cards is very low (4 wins for a maximum of 1 loss), so you will easily lose your tickets. By buying Artifact, you receive 5 tickets. Spend 1 ticket to (maybe) win a reward:
[list][*]Win 3 games (with maximum 1 defeat) to win 1 ticket.
[*]Win 4 games (with maximum 1 defeat) to win 1 ticket + 1 booster cards.
[*]Win 5 games (with maximum 1 defeat) to win 1 ticket + 2 booster cards.
[*]Lose 2 times, and your run stops.[/list]

Finally, yes, you can play with all the cards in the game for free. This game mode is called the [i]Casual Phantom Draft[/i]. But the cards drawn are random, and will never belong to you. Once your deck is built with these cards, you participate for free in a run, in the same way as paid runs with tickets, except that you will never win anything. Once a condition of end of run occurs (5 victories for 1 maximum defeat, or 2 defeats), the run ends. You will need to redo a new deck with other cards.
The reflection is long, if you lose a lot, you will spend a lot of time creating a deck against little time to play. You will be quickly disgusted with the game.
Game is dead already. With a ridiculous business model, it was doomed from the start. There are better ways of spending your 20 dollars. Had the foundation of a good game but any hope for it is gone now.
I love the concept and the gameplay. However I just refunded it after figuring out there is no way to acquire cards for free. That's pretty rediculous with a $20 base price. It's a shame this great game is ruined by valve's greed.
I Think that this game has great depth and the mechanics are amazing. The best card game I have played, i did enjoy magic and hearthstone but they didn't feel rewarding and sometimes you couldn't do much but feel helpless(I'm sure it happens in this too but i'm yet to experience it). This game requires deep strategy, I would say it is highly compareable to chess.

However I will not reccomend this game until they change the reward system, for most players this will be a large turn off. I will change my review when they change the reward system(or lack of one).

Even something as basic as a login reward system of sorts would be fine similar to warframe.
Not impressed.  As someone who has been playing magic the gathering for close to 19 years, won an international tournament a few years ago, and 3rd place last year in Ireland...

As someone who enjoys Hearthstone RNG (fun factor only, just quick tavern brawl while I eat lunch or something) it has given me some laughs at least.

Artifact has given me nothing. Briefly during the tutorial match, I felt the thrill of all the micro-management and how complex it gets, but that is the only strong point. I have never played DOTA 2, I do not like MOBA's, so trying to relate to the references in Artifact just doesn't work for me sadly. Really wish Valve took this chance to create an entire new story and world, especially since they had Richard Garfield at the helm. 

Overall, I think Artifact is a missed opportunity. I was so hyped for it, because I am suffering from Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone burnout, I have tried every card game out there, Elder Scrolls was decent, but I got bored fast. I am just thankful I have Magic the Gathering Arena online now.

Something about Magic the Gathering has always spoken to me, the quotes on the cards, the expansive usage of vocabulary actually helped me impress teachers in my highschool days when I would write papers, etc. The artwork in Magic is also gorgeous and very creative year over year. This game is just lifeless and dull in comparison, I wanted to love it, I really did.

For those of you with slower computers, this game will run a little laggy, not the games fault, I am aware my Athlon 200GE with Vega 3 graphics is very weak. lol
*****Refunds: Once you've claimed your Starter Decks and Card Packs you will be ineligible for an automatic refund of Artifact via Steam. Before claiming your Starter Decks and Card Packs, you will be able to play games against bots and other players using pre-constructed decks.*****


TL;DR No refunds*






I mean I guess it's better than most since you can actually trade the cards but tbh not worth $20 buy-in just to easily partake in the TTG aspect of it and the gameplay of it isn't too amazing.
1. The Game Itself
The Artifact game is a unique experience that, on its own, has not received nearly enough recognition for what it has accomplished.
Artifact distinguishes itself from the leading 2 card games (Hearthstone/Magic) by switching from a strategy-focused experience where the game really starts at deck-building (what is my deck trying to achieve and how do I do that as efficiently as possible) to a tactics-focused experience where your deck becomes more of a toolchest to engage the board/your opponent.  The change from namesake cards hiding in your deck to automatically deploying them very much smooths over the inherent variance that card games suffer from and lets the player feel more in control during the course of the game.  Automatically deploying creeps (albeit to random lanes) keeps each round fresh and allows players to really showcase their ability to adjust to a constantly changing battlefield.
The concept of three lanes is a great way for players to work on resource management, as each round the player must ensure that their mana/gold can support 3 lanes, and it also asks the user to decide when losing a lane is worth it in the grander scheme of the game.  I'm a fan of resource management in general so this aspect was a nice bonus.
Common complaints arise when people are introduced to the fact that units attack in 1 of 3 directions (forward or either diagonal).  This caught me very off guard, especially given my history with card games (beyond the big 2) but thinking back on it, this is exactly what a TACTICS game needs.  This is combined with an item shop (additional toolbox game mechanic) that itself has variance.
On a polish level, there is absolutely nothing negative to say about Artifact, and in fact I applaud the immense efforts Valve put in to really make the game feel smooth and alive.  In fact, bar none, the VO for this game blows most games (not just card games) out of the water.

Overall, the game, once understood, is a fresh take on card games in general and I would very much like to see more from this genre.

2. The Monitization
This is where things get hairy.
I think Valve made a huge mistake by trying to copy the monitization model of paper card games, and especially to try and build the economy around the Steam marketplace (which really says "greedy" to me, especially because of the marketplace fee).
I understand the game was originally created to instill a confidence in the marketplace: cards would never get balanced, players could not grind for cards (like with the big 2), events that give rewards must have some sort of entry free, etc.  Whether it's for the market or Valve despises "addiction mechanisms" of other games and wants to be more ethical, I feel the current version is still missing the mark.
One common reason I've seen is that Valve doesn't want to use lootboxes and wants users to be able to buy the cards they want directly, to which I reply: "well why not make this a living card game (sell the full set)" or "what about a subscription that unlocks all cards"?  Both of these are just as ethical but doesn't rely on a marketplace and instead Valve could make money off of cosmetics.  I very much feel the monitization where you pay $20 for the game and then pay for each card (and where the "resale" involves losing a percentage) is not helping the game reach its full potential.  I was very much disappointed that no matter how many hours I put in, there was no guarantee I'd ever see a new piece of content (new card).

3. Client Features
The client itself has a lot of features missing from other card games but is also missing features that I'd expect from a fully released, competitive card game.  Chat/friends lists are mediocre, there is no way to review past games (replays/stats), there is no way to see how you rank relative to others, the client didn't have any connection to Twitch (to watch streams/tournaments), accessibility settings, and the list goes on.  In this regard, the client feels like a public beta (by contrast, the in-game experience is a released game).  I fully expect these features to arrive if Valve continues to support Artifact but, at the time of writing this, the client feels very lacking.

4. Summary
This game very much appeals to a specific type of player and JUST that type of player.  Decision fatigue is very real especially when you are just starting out, monitization is somewhat designed to take money from bad players and benefit the very top players as well as Valve, progression is non-existent/hidden, but if you're able to look past all of that, the core game loop of Artifact is a wonderful, unique experience.

There is a very small subset of people to whom I'd recommend this game hands down.  However for the vast majority of gamers, I would recommend saving your $20+.
[b]It's a TCG so you pay for your cards with money.[/b]

This is totally fine with me. I used to play Magic the Gathering at some local store and I can assure you I am fine with investing in cards ...... BUT this is not a real TCG at the moment. I can't directly trade cards with friends. I cant lend my cards to a friend so he/she can try out if it could fit their deck. All I can do is put them on the store and have them sold off automatically which takes away alot of what is a TCG. Trading with people is an essential part of the experience. 

Oh you got this card? How about I give you this and that? What are you looking for? Maybe I got something in my collection to give you. Oh hey you are new? Just take some of my unused non-value cards enjoy.

This part is missing entirely at the moment and the only reason I for myself can't approve the monetization model of this Game.

[b]Otherwise a great Game. Please make it a real TCG.	[/b]
As a huge fan of cards games I cant reccomend this one. Its not a bad card game, sure the gameplay is a little slow and the three lanes can get tedius, but it is entertaining. I always felt like there was something to fix. But there is one big flaw. There is no way to get more cards without buying them. There are no daily quests, which means you have to buy packs to get any more cards than you started with. Which means:


Expect to spend more than the $20 if you are looking to get more than the basic cards.


That being said, if youre a big card game fan and dont mind buying packs, its not a bad game. 
P.S. MAKE DAILY QUESTS
Puchased and was enjoying myself. Until I relised you are not awarded with cards/packs via in game progress/rewards. Beyond the point of a refund now as i opened the original packs. You don't get a chance to see the complete lack of in game card rewards untill after you open the packs and void your refund. Thanks Valve, shady fooks.
This isn't a review from and angry customer but from a dissapointed one. Artifact is one of those cases when the game mechanic is fantastic but the business model is garbage. If you don't agree with this model you should buy this game ONLY if you like draft as it's free to play and there is no need for microtransactions. I knew what I was getting into before buying the game so I wasn't suprised by the microtransactions and my review isn't biased because of this.

The reason I wrote "game mechanic" is because the core game is great but the UI has its flaws and the end product seems rushed and unfinished. This would have been ok if this was a small company but not one of the biggest in the industry. Valve decided to omit MMR so after playing for a while you feel like there isn't a goal at all as "PlAyInG fOr FuN" won't get you far. The rushed UI for free draft still has the button claim rewards if you win more than 3 matches without losing 2 times even though there is no reward. There isn't a chat with the opponent or any taunts. No daily goals or anything.
This is absolutely unprofesional from such a company and for a product that isn't free.

Next, the business model. A lot of people argued that this a a perfect model for a TCG, however there isn't even any traid. The only thing you can do is sell your cards on the market for a 15% cut. I'm not going to debate is it really good or not as there are a lot of pros and cons but I'm sure this game will be dead in a year if they don't drastically change it. I'm really frustrated with this point because the game is fantastic. The matches aren't decided from the beginning and it feels fantastic making stratigic plays that win you the game. But because of the price tag of 20$ and microtransactions the audience will be small. If they followed the Gwent model of getting rewards as I believe it's the best (you can easily get a competitive deck just from playing) and sold cosmetics as Valve does in Dota and CSGO then Artifact would have been huge with a growing playerbase. As it is the player base will be shrienking every day until the game dies.
I was really hopeful for Artifact, I thought Valve could show the world how to make a proper card game, and by proper I mean a game where money or grinding are not interfering with the gameplay, just like Dota. Don't get me wrong, the game is fantastic, it's deep and beautiful, but Valve really missed out on the monetisation here.

Many people say it's cheaper than any other card game and they're missing the point entirely. A Valve card game with a Dota theme should have every card available to everyone for people to experiment and play the game and not to play the market. I would be fine with a higher upfront price and however many microtransactions that do not affect gameplay, and maybe another "expansion type" purchase whenever they release new content but always with every card or aspect of gameplay available to everyone from the get go. This is what I thought was "The Valve way".

I will probably enjoy some draft now and then but I'm really dissapointed in Valve on this one.
AVOID. 

This game has one goal in mind - to suck as much money out of you as possible. Any cars beyond what you get with the cost of entry costs money - every game mode with a reward costs money. In other words this card game is going to use the best card of all - your credit card. 

Even if you're okay with spending tons of cash the game itself itsn't even all that great. Most of it is pretty hands off - with so much emphasis on card placement on the boards its absurd to me that you have no control over hero placement beyond lanes and randomized targeting system means your monsters will end up wasting attacks - i had a tower down to a few health and 3 of the 3 people in the lane assigned to attack a single creep for some dumb reason. There's more random aspects to the game than there are player choices. 

Mana is automatically ramped a la Hearthstone - each turn adding 1 to the initial 3 mana available to cast your cards. While I'm sure theres plenty of depth if you can get over the random elements in the game I cant really get behind a card game where matches take 40 min - 1 hour and - like I mentioned previously - unless you're paying money there's no reward or progression to speak of for playing. 

The cards themselves are prety bland, a single color, text and a picture. Meh. At the time of this review the best cards in the game cost more than the game itself. 

If you have tons of free time and tons of money I'd say go for it - but for everyone else there's PLENTY of other card games that are not only free, but are very generous with packs/cards/progression. The whole point of this game is for valve to take a cut from every sale and resale in a card game which will net them insane profits. 

Boo Valve, boo.
1. Zero progression.
2. Zero ways of earning cards.
3. Pay to win.
4. Pay to play competetively (even though you purchased the game).
 
This is supposed to be a Valve game, not an EA game.
Valve.... why have you done this?
It's 2018 guys, c'mon...

P.S. The game does have some strong positives but they are completely outweighed by this EA-style business model.
This game is an actual disease; it's designed to appeal to those with addictive personalities and to slowly drain their bank accounts of every last cent just for a few good cards. It is absolutely horrifying to see Valve adopt such a shitty sales model for a game; if you are going to release a card game, don't charge for the fucking game and then charge for the cards as well, it's one or the other. 

Also, the tutorial is a facade, you do not own all the cards you play in the tutorial or all the cards in the prebuilt decks, you can't edit the prebuilt decks for this reason, and you only obtain a few of these cards after you open your starter packs, immediately disqualifying you from a refund, this game is designed to trap you in and take your money.
P2W + B2P + P2P
I am wasting my time so you don't : don't waste your time here. Period.

By the way, that's funny how they now specify their refund policy and our non-retraction acceptance before order payment after Valve was fined (not long ago) for not doing so.
And now they offer you to get items in this new game, after (2+ hours) tutorial, to even have a look to rest of game features, that will prevent you to get refund if you decide to.
Shady? Scammy?

After novelty aspect, there is no replay incentive.
Artifact won't get into MTG market, well played Mr Garfield! hehe...

I hope future will prove me wrong and make my time and money worth again x_x

Honestly, it's a pretty fun and competent TCG. That being said, I couldn't reccomend buying it. Valve cut the value in half by only giving new players 5 packs instead of 10. In addition to that, the vast majority of the playerbase has left. It now takes a significant chunk of time to get into a match, and the likelihood of that match being against a evenly-skilled opponent is nil. 

It hurts to say because I do genuinely enjoy the gameplay, but I'd absolutely avoid purchasing the game in it's current state.
I usually don't write reviews, but I want to write one for this game, beause I was looking forward to playing it. I have almost 3,000 hours in DotA 2, which makes me even more disappointed in this game, because I like the characters, the art, the lore, and the idea with the seperated playing field.
However, there are so many fundamental issues with this game:

-RNG can screw you just as much as in Hearthstone. Games can be decided by creep RNG, attack arrow RNG, item shop RNG and initial deployment RNG (and all chance based cards of course, but at least you can influence those). You can lose a hero in the very first round without being able to react at all and from that point on you are in an immediate disadvantage in that lane. You can win or lose games because in the decisive moment, one player got two creeps in the lane where they needed them and the other player gets the creeps in lanes where they are completely useless. 
And why can't I at least decide which opponents my heros attack? It feels completely stupid when my hero would be able to deal 10 damage to the opponent's tower but rather decides to attack an enemy to the side that would die in this round anyway.

-No way to earn cards without paying. You know f2p (free to play), you know p2p (pay to play), you know p2w (pay to win), now get ready for the next step in the evolution: p2p2p: Pay to pay to play. Sure you can play without buying tickets or packs. But in that case you will not be able to earn cards and there is no incentive to play, because there is no progression towards anything at all.

-Losing in any of the modes where you can earn cards is so much more frustrating than in similar games. When I have a bad arena run in other games, I just lost a bit of in-game currency that I earn back relatively quickly by just playing the game anyway. When I have a bad arena run in Artifact, I feel like wasting real money. This is even worse when you lose due to bad RNG.

I could write more, I'm just so disappointed in this game. Anyway, here's some suggestions how to fix this:

Reduce RNG impact:
-Get rid of random attack arrows for heros. If there is no opponent blocking my hero, let me decide where I want to attack. Arrows for creeps are ok.
-Make a deployment phase before the first actual round. Keep the limits that you have currently (e.g. one hero + creep per lane), but let the players decide the position of the units. Have alternating turns for this, just like the normal rounds and give initiative in the first round to the player who passed first during the deployment phase.
-Let the players position one creep per round themselves. I know this is not how it works in DotA, but the creep RNG can just screw over your game so hard, I cannot think of a better solution. I'm not only speaking about losing games here, you can win really contested and exciting lanes simply by lucky creep deployment. And then you're sitting there: "Thanks for winning the game for me I guess". Doesn't feel like a deserved win.

Ways to earn cards without paying:
-Make an arena (or some other mode) that you can enter with some form of reasonably aquireable in-game currency to earn cards. At least for me, this is the minimum they need to change in this game before I consider playing again. There is simply no excuse for not having this in the game. I guess this is the result of publisher greed winning over player satisfaction.

That's my opinion of the game's current state. I could maybe overlook the annoying RNG factor, but not being able to earn cards by simply playing the game is just horrible. Valve seems so step in line with Blizzard and Bethesda by prioritizing monetization over player enjoyment.

The production value of the game is certainly very good, but I cannot recommend it at this point (it also took me five tries until steam finally decided to post this review...).


Update after the first patches:
You can now earn a limited amount of packs and tickets in the game. I played another five hours to see if that is enough to make me like the game, but it just isn't. The RNG just sucks out all the fun for me, it is still one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.
I would give it a medium rating now if steam had that option, but because I have to chose between recommending it or not, I won't change my rating. I still don't have fun with the game.
From the beginning I decided that the game wasn't really for me and so I wanted a refund. Turns out that if you open the 10 packs that artifact gives you you cannot get a refund anymore. I guess I have to play the game now that I got it.
Two things I did not like about the game , how random the creeps spawn , and that it always start from the left lane !.. like ALWAYS. makes you must have blink cards equiped or return to fountain ccard to move heros from a lane your enemy abandonned because if you keep your heros there hoping you can deal 80 damage to a fountain .. that is never going to happen.  I think fountain HP must be dropped to 50 or 60 so your enemy starts to give a Sh*t when its really low !

I still plan to play the game more , might change my review if I start to enjoy the game more ... The cards are kind of well balanced in my opinion.  I just feel that the game is more luck depandant than anything else.

Thank you valve for making a new game finally , last game volvo made was in 2013 , I am shocked that it took them over 5 years to come out withh a cards game ... please get serious , I barely open steam anymore beacuse all AAA games now are being released on their appropriate lunchers , now please go back to making me HL3  or a new IP or something. If you dont  steam will die slowly.
One of the biggest disappointments of 2018, THE biggest disappointment for me. A game from Valve and Richard Garfield, what could go wrong? The game is not fun and frustrating at times. Did Richard Garfield have any involvement in this game? It seems like he just spent time in the valve offices to give ideas and not get hands-on, since I see no evidence of playtesting to see if gameplay is fun. Every card game has an element of randomness but the randomness in Artifact is on another level. Creeps can spawn in lanes that you don't need them in or enemy creeps spawn in front of your heroes denying killing blows or significant damage on towers. Arrows directing damage is also random and direct a lone creep to destroy a tower or a hero to direct all their damage to a lowly creep. These aspects are not small things, they can add up to a win or a loss. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR MONEY, I thought if you did you kept the cards in the decks that you can play. You do not keep them, you only test them out and cannot change them. That means you have buy all the cards you need to get a deck you are interested in playing (and how do you know if you are going to like the deck? you only can test out only specific deck created by valve). The item deck is also random. Want a teleport scroll to move a hero to another lane? Tough luck, you don't get one when you need it - better stock up. There are huge disparities in the power level of heroes - some heroes are unplayable (if you do you are playing at a disadvantage), most of which are the ones that you are given for free. 

Perhaps draft will be the great equalizer, you don't need to buy a constructed deck to play (although you need to pay to get into a draft). Draft is confusing and a bad experience, mostly due to heroes being in the packs you draft. You need to open a good hero (later in the draft you need to open a good hero in the colours you picked) in your first pack as all the good heroes are picked early and often so you will get those underpowered heroes. It feels so bad playing this game: intiative is confusing and frustrating (making sense to people who play this game for days), most cheaper spells have such a small impact so that they are usually useless, colours do not have a solid identity and having heroes of a certain colour in a lane to cast spells of that colour is stupid. They can try to balance the game as they are trying with the patches but what is needed is a complete redesign of the game, as it stands the game is frustratingly dull and I am baffled as how people can play more than a couple of games in Artifact (perhaps they bought all the cards they need and now are invested?).

Valve can do wrong (remember Ricochet?) but I recommend that they now stick to developing steam and updating their previous games. Artifact is further evidence that they do not want to make (fun) games, riding the card game bandwagon and trying to get a quick buck off the steam marketplace - no-one is forcing you to make games Valve.
Richard Garfield and Valve - what could go wrong?

A lesson learned for me. I didnt really know anything about the game before buying it. Also I immediately pumped ~80€ in buying packs. Holy shit, what a disappointment.  I love TGC and strategy, but this game is boring af. And on top of that it is an economy driven by greed.
First i was super exited when first heard of this game. Closer release and when i had more info how game works i wasnt even sure if i wanted play anymore. Im not even talking about how much money it could cost. Yeh it still small negative thing. But im use to pay for card games. So its nothing new to me. This card game it self is one of better ones. Maybe little too much random elements and i hate how your first heroes can just die first round just with coinflip.. or you can kill enemy hero just like that in first round if you lucky. I wish we be able have more control over where creep go and damn the attack arrows give huge luck factor too.

Main problems i have with this game is that if you dont like draft mode. There isnt much to play for. You dont really get anything for playing other modes you get no rank, points or anything. I felt i had no reason even collect cards in this card game if the Draft is going to be main focus. In draft you dont need any cards. This game can be good for people who love draft mode. But player for my self who never liked it. There isnt much to enjoy.

Game could come good in future. If there be reason to play other than Draft and maybe lessen some luck and random factors with creep and attack arrows what do make huge impact how game go.
I find it hard to give a valve game a negative review.
Especially when games [b]much worse[/b] then it like hearthstone have so many active players.
but if you are looking for a tower defend card game i would have to recommend

[u]Scrolls[/u]  (or "[u]Callers Bane[/u]" as it's called now)
     [u]Free game no microtransactions, amazing gameplay[/u]
Or if your just in it for some fun rng 
classic mode on [u]Chaos reborn[/u]
The gameplay itself seems solid and with enough depth, with a nice variety to build decks to suit the needs of various game styles and the overall presentation is top notch.

However all cards are purchased with real money with no way to grind for random card drops, coupled with more gambling oriented purchases I can't in good conscience recommend this game.

THIS GAME IS A TRAP.

Valve have taken over 4 months to address any problems with the game, and refuse to communicate with the community about the issues they have because they believe themselves to be so enigmatic and infallible that they don't believe that they need to actually consider what their rapidly shrinking community needs from them in order to fix their game that they dramatically over-promised and under-delivered with. Artifact is, in fact, hilariously emblematic of the core problem with what Valve has turned into since they enjoyed a modicum of success, in that Valve is so fixated on the idea that they AND ONLY THEY are the authority on what makes a good game and what does that they failed to even listen to their own HAND PICKED BETA TESTERS, most of whom had been playing other online CCGs professionally and/or had a significant amount of expertise in DESIGNING THEM. They completely ignored the numerous warnings and reports from their Beta testers, which was clearly a huge mistake because many of the problems plaguing Artifact right now are ones we have evidence of not only EXISTING, but, in fact, HAVING BEEN REPORTED TO VALVE MONTHS IN F*CKING ADVANCE during the beta period! Which means that the period of time before official launch that some players were allowed access to the game WASNT EVEN A BETA PERIOD! They weren't employed to TEST the game, they were employed to SELL the game! THAT is why they were large-audience streamers and personalities, not because of their expertise, but because Valve wanted to exploit their influence for next-to-free advertisement, which is an apropos display of the exploitative and lazy behavior that put Artifact in the ground in the first place.

The most awful thing, however, is that all of these things would be excusable if Valve gave any indication whatsoever that they actually gave a crap about the quality of their game. In truth, Artifact is the clearest example of bait-and-switch that I've ever seen. Valve sold the game on the premise of competitive support and tournaments and events and regular content patches, and then when people purchased their product, they wordlessly abandoned it and their audience along with it. At the time of writing, the most recent "official" Artifact update is from December 20th, 2019. That's over TWO MONTHS AGO, which is HALF THE ENTIRE LIFETIME OF THE F*CKING GAME.

Artifact has revealed a level of systemic unprofessionalism within Valve that I sincerely hope will haunt them for the remainder of their tenure as a developer. Although, I suppose they aren't really a developer anymore, are they. Developers care about their product. Valve has gotten so used to merely selling the hard work of other people and taking a slice of the pie that they've forgotten what it means to make and maintain a product of their own.
I've been a fan of card games all my life, played a fair share of Magic back in the day, and a ton of Hearthstone. Dota 2 is also one of my favorite games so naturally I had to get this game right away. 
Now, I love the game, in my opinion it's way better than Hearthstone, it's harder as well, but that's what I enjoy in a card game. The plays that make you think the most, thinking about what to play in which lane, what not to play to have initiative where you need it, etc.

But even with that I can't recommend this game if you're not someone that's willing to spend a lot of money just to fill your collection up, and not even have a complete one at that. Which is where the game's real problem lies.

It's a 20 dollar game, you get a starting collection and 10 free packs + 5 tickets. Each pack contains 12 cards: 2 items, 1 hero, and 9 normal cards with at least one of those 12 being a rare. So a new playing would have 10 heroes, 20 items and 90 cards. That's an alright start, but it seriously limits you in what kind of deck you can play and the effectiveness of that deck. A lot of the key cards in this game are rares, so you need to be lucky enough to get those already.
And the credit card is indeed the strongest card in the game, because that's it, there is no ingame currency, everything you want is with real money. Card packs and tickets alike. There is a steam market of course but again, pay money just to be able to play a decent deck on top of already having bought the game.

There is the Expert Play option which has 3 different modes, each of which let's you play up to 5 wins or 2 losses, whichever comes first. But you need to pay 1 ticket to enter, and the 3rd mode requires 5 packs on top of that.
As a skilled cardgame player and if you've already spent a lot of money on packs to be able to get a proper deck, then you're likely to reach 3 wins or higher. At 3 you get a Ticket, 4 gives you an extra pack, and 5 gives you two packs. So if you manage to reach 5 wins you get your ticket that you used to enter back, and you get 2 packs. Which certainly isn't great, but it's something.
Now, that's for players that have spent a lot already, if you're a new player and look to not spend any money, it's highly unlikely that you'll consistently reach those 3 wins just to get your ticket back. You'd just end up using your 5 tickets, maybe win a few back but run out eventually. And then you're completely done, nothing left to get unless you pay.

So for that reason I cannot recommend this game, as much as I love playing it. You can only win through your credit card, and let's be honest, that's not a win.
The game its actually good, but i cannot recomend it since there is no progression in this game if you don´t spend money after buying it, there is no ranking system, you cannot play a practice draft against your friends (yes, you can create a tournament, but you need at least 4 people, i don´t get why they don`t added the draft option when playing against friends, makes no sense to me)

Never expected a Valve game to have this kind of monetization that doesn`t allow any progression for the players that want to go F2P after buying the game
Artifact. When archeologists find the fabled software legend Valve Software, they will collect this [i]"Artifact"[/i] and attribute it to their downfall. It is just that bad. Pretty looking, but pay to win and relatively basic. Save your gold for something else my friends.

Fight me GabeN!
PAY to PAY to PLAY. Sums it up really good. 
Oh, you want to play anything else other than casual, Do you want to play expert ( ranked basically ) ?

Well you gotta PAY real money sucker. 
This type of monetization would be disgusting even if the game were ftp.
edit. Valve has released a few patches that have improved the monetization/progression but at the end of the day the gameplay is pretty mediocre and it's just not enough for me to reccomend the game.

Putting aside all the monetization issues, the game is... alright. It's pretty complicated but the balance between the cards is way off. Much of the Call to Arms set is essentially unusable in constructed and there are heroes/creeps/spells/items that are simply worse than others.
This artifact is not yet curious.  

Amazing execution, the Development and Art departments did some great work but this is let down by Game Design and Product Management smoking crack.  
First off, the monetisation setup for this game is worst-of-both-worlds. Not sure what they're trying to acheive but they're turning their backs on network effects by making it hard for free-to-play players to enter. We'll see if that gamble pans out in the long term but I remain skeptical.  
In terms of design, firstly, its not very interesting. Its just Hearthstone but more (three boards). 
The current meta basically comes down to trying to make it so your enemy can't use their cards. So, its not fun for someone to lose. Its not really a fun game yet.    
Generally the card design/scaling/balance is completely off. I'd say they'll fix it over time but considering some of the cards available in the game i'm not sure. They'd have to delete/rework a few card effects for me to gain hope.   
Primarily, I don't understand how you make this game in 2018. It does literally _nothing_ to address any of the issues the base design of Hearthstone gave us years ago.   
For a Valve game I am deeply disappointed by the lack of game design innovation. 

Amazing polish, lots of great ideas but sadly the fun has not been found. Go back, try again. Rework the fundamental design and pacing of the game and you might have a winner on your hands. Before that only play it if you don't mind spending cash and want a change from HearthStone/ShadowVerse. I'd suggest checking Gwent or maybe MTG instead.
Fun game, absolute trash cashgrab monetization model. Bought this game to play free draft mode with a friend. Turns out, they don't even allow that. If you want to play with a friend you need to play constructed, which costs a fortune to get a halfway decent deck additionally to the full price you already paid. Nope.
The amount of RNG in basic game mechanics is utterly baffling in this game.

I bought this game because I was impressed by its complexity and believed they would replace some of the randomness inherent in card games with actual difficulty/skill.

Instead I am met with random unit deployments, random attack patterns for unblocked units, random shop offerings, .....
And that's not even going into some the utterly ridiculous RNG cards in this game. I just won a game due to my Drow facetanking the superbuffed enemy sven for 4 turns straight due to Cheating Death.

I was already on the fence due to the whole monetization and complete lack of any progression thing, but this game is far too complicated for casual fun and far too infuriating from a competitive point of view.

Downvote from me
[h1]i have 300+ hours in this game. was w8ing it for a really long time. but now, i am really disappointed, here is why [/h1]


[*] game is not really rewarding. i pay for game, i pay to get some tickets through recycling. got 11 perfect runs in prized draft. i invest both time and money at least moderately. i can't even make single constructed deck yet with 300+ hours.

[*] last updates giving some tickets and packs are just not enough. i almost got lvl 11 and what will i get for playing after reaching lvl 16? i tell you what, nothing unless i pay more to play. its not really hard to add some rewards to free modes.

[*] rng is huge both in drafting phase and in game. many times i lost because of a minion turns another way or 2 hereos of mine are dead at the very first round etc. or in draft phase, i pick some good blue cards and planning to go 2 blue at least. guess what, i never see a blue hero to pick in whole draft phase. this is way too much randomness.

graphics are alright, general gameplay is alrgiht. the deepness is really cool. but it needs to be improved in regarding rewarding system and rng asap.
Artifact has a lot of interesting ideas but frankly for me the cons outweigh the pros.

Pros:
+ Despite people who haven't played card games before complaining, this game is extremely affordable and probably the single cheapest CCG on the market right now.
+ A lot of unique mechanics and ideas that breathe life into the genre

Cons:
- The slog of going through 3 lanes makes games extremely long and tedious
- the cards themselves are boring with most just being damage spells
- Very few cool creatures, you pretty much are expected to just focus on your heroes and other creatures are an after thought one of the big appeals of a ccg to me is seeing all the cool creatures
- THE BIGGEST OFFENDER is RNG, this game has an obnoxious amount of RNG which makes you feel like your decisions and strategies don't matter. I will never play a competitive card game where your strategies are left to dice rolls it is poor game design.
It's like playing in a Road Runner episode, only... you're Wile E. Coyote and nothing works the way it should.

RNG. You get or you don't get the cards (like every cardgame), but on top of that, random items in the shop, random number of creep spawns, random position of creep in lane, random position of heroes in lane, random attack directions,  random-random-random everything in drafts.

With MMR, you eventually get ppl close to your skill level, which means games are decided mostly by RNG. But... you need to win 5 before you lose 2.

Now add real money to that mix. Pay for those tickets and packs only for game after game after game to be fucked by RNG (in  your favor or not). Fun, ha?
This is one of the best card/strategy games I've ever played. Sadly, there's no way to earn cards/packs without spending more money in the game, and the competitive draft/constructed modes are locked behind a paywall as well. The lack of ways to earn cards without paying makes it impossible for me to reccommend the game to anyone, and it will severely affect the playerbase. I hope Valve realizes this greed will most likely drive the playerbase away towards more generous f2p CCGs.
This game is actually very fun and theres a lot of complexity. There is no way that i can recommend this due to its monetization regarding tournaments, or even casual collecting of cards.
packs are £1.59
constructed must win 3 games before you get that ticket back, before you lose two games. if you win two additional games (up to 5) you get one or two packs respectively to open. again before you lose 2 games.
the first draft tournament is one ticket, works as above for prize support and you DONT keep your cards you draft.
the second draft game you spend two tickets and 5(!) packs to enter. basically same rewards as above, but you do keep your drafted cards too.

there is no other way to obtain cards, apart from market or buy a pack.
you can break down excess cards on a 20 to 1 basis for 1 ticket.

I really do love this mechanically and this will be fun to play casually with friends, but i honestly cant recommend this because of its real world cardgame monetization into a virtual cardgame, where you can never get your money back as any cards you decide to sell goes straight back to your steam wallet.
Too mentally draining to the point of not being fun.  There are better, more exciting card games to play.  The free dota mod "dota auto chess" is basically a better card game than this.
The game is very rich with decision making and there are a lot of variables influencing the outcome. The gameplay is surprinsingly very intense for a card game, you almost feel like you're playing a strategy game in real time.

Despite its very good gameplay I can't recommend this game because of its predatory monetization. Even if a similar monetization is being used by nearly every digital card game, that doesn't justify this type of P2W model being propagated and ripping people off.

Buy only if you love card games and hardcore strategy games, and have enough money to continually throw at a single video game, otherwise avoid and wait to see if they (hopefully) change their ways.
Short Warning:

- You cannot buy cards with in-game rewards.
- All packs have to be paid for with actual cash
- Buying this game gives you a starter-set basically.  Not access to everything there is.

Fgured this out 3 hours in. Refund denied.

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. The monotization is abismal. You WILL NOT get enough cards at the start to build a viable deck. You WILL NOT be able to earn more cards without spending money on tickets, to play in gauntlets, that will give you 1 tecket back at 3 wins, 1 pack at 4, and another pack at 5 wins, 2 losses and the gauntlet is over. The game itself is great, its a dope card game. BUT, the base mechanic of spawning in units into the lane breaks the game. Heros WILL NOT spawn accross or next to other heros, meaning you WILL NOT be able to kill heros that are in lanes without specific ressources. And these ressources are minimal too practically non existent depending on the deck you build/colors you choose. Meaning draft is broken, because anybody who happens to get cards that spawn units will win. Constructed is bland because the unit spawn is broken. Everyone is playing swarm because the opponent will never be able to attack their hero in the lane. Or playing decks built entirely to destroy heros as quickly as possible, which require more cards/combos and mana than swarm making them incredibly inconsistent. There is practically nothing in the game to destroy numerous units, and there is practically nothing in the game enabling you to attack specific units (in fact the swarm decks have the most options for selecting targets). This game is insanely unbalanced not only in strategy, but in monotization. Since the above factors are the entirety of the game, if you DON'T have the strongest cards, you will never win. Meaning you have to buy packs/cards just to enjoy the game.

I was so excited for this game, what an utter dissappointment. If you like spawning units on a board then you will love this game. If you want deep strategy in a deck building game, go play Yu-Gi-Oh duel links or Magic Arena. Valve has made no effort to adjust their monotization, so it is incredibly unlikely they will do anything about the inbalance of the game.
all the potential fun and enjoyment is completely ruined by the fact that its literally pay-to-win.
You can not get more cards than the starter pack offers, unless you buy them by packs or win them in a arena mode which requires a ticket payed with real money.
There is not a single benefit in playing the casual or the ranked online mode, becasue you dont get any kind of ingame currency or progress and thus you have to suffer countless losses against players with a better cardcollection.
As long as they dont change the ways you can get yourself new cards and expand your collection other than right now, i will not recommend buying this game.

I want to start with the 2 things that from my point of view are essential for an online TCG:
1. Being able to trade my cards directly with other players (even if just my friends, or people I've had on my friend list for at least a month - still, as long as anything like this is not available, this is not a TCG)
2. Some kind of ranked ladder for both constructed and draft (both free and 'expert/entry+reward' variants!). Without some kind of progression, I'll get bored of this game sooner than later.

Other than that, the game is honestly great - balance is tough to judge this early into the release, but it seems fine and I feel like the RNG is also having just the right amount of impact where I feel like I don't feel that I lost games I deserved to win and vice-versa.
I'm enjoying it very much... but as long as both of the things I mentioned are not present, I feel like I should not be recommending it to others.
Pay 2 win... very disappointing if you buy this game and shortly figure out that you can't make any progress in the game without paying additional money. This is outrageous... Buying the game for 18 € and having to pay for each additional pack which include the same basic cards you already have in your starter pack. So it's basically money burning. Also there seems to be not even achievement or some campaigns or leveling up or something to strive for. So this is like paying 18 bucks for a demo-version of the actual game! Valve brings PAY-TO-WIN to a higher level. Good Work!!!!


This game is great, and nobody should buy it.

It's got very satisfying, highly strategic play. The game feels great to play, you are constantly making interesting decisions, and it's overall just a blast to play.

However, this game was released as a skeleton of what it should be. There's no chat, no progression, no way to reliably get cards without dumping money into the system, the market is a mess right now, and as it stands the budget required to participate in constructed play is *ridiculous.*

If this changes, I will gladly update this review.
Sorry, Valve but Artifact is an unfair/unbalanced card game.
Let's start with good things first:

+Graphics are good for a card game. (Card animation effects, spell cards, trap cards, and attack moves).

+Gameplay idea that you have to fight on three lanes just like in the real Dota2.  Take down towers and go for ancient. (but there is something I don't like about it.)

+Unlimited card decks. 

Now Bad things:

- Unfairness You can't manage your starting hand or hero placements on fields. You start the game. Enemy Kills every single hero in every single lane. In the next round, he takes 2x siege and game is lost... (Valve, please add an option where players can choose which hero going to which lane.)

- Many cards are unbalanced. (1mana cost +2 modify hero red card/-2 armor 2mana cost red card/ +2 armor mana cost 2 green card/+3 siege mana cost 3 black card.) And IF happens that enemy gets 3 copies in hand of that card at the game beginning... You're done for. Or this deck - Two Ogre Magi/ One Crystal Maiden/One Zeus and One Veno. Not fair at all. You get electrified after every single card. Plus two ogres get TWO copies of cards back to owners hand, and cm keeps refreshing tower's mana.)

-Confusing. Once we're talking about cards. There are so many cards whose effects are so similar, sometimes you forgot which was which and then you play out the wrong card just because it looked like that one card.

-Now the thing I said earlier that I liked the idea about lanes BUT why you have to take out just two towers to win? If it's Dota 2 card game, You have to kill ancient. (Wouldn't it better when you destroy enemy's tower You have to kill their ancient AND ANCIENT COULD SHARE HP ONE EVERY GAME after tower been destroyed. Example. Lane 1. Kills tower, ancient shows up creeps hit it. 80hp-12hp=68hp/Lane 2 still has tower 22hp/ Lane 3 Sven kills the tower and ancient shows up, but since creeps on lane 1 hit it now it'd have 68hp on the third lane.

-Matches are a way too long. It takes ~30-40min to finish one game. (And if another person is trolling it can get even longer. I mean if Player waits till last second of his allowed time and then plays out card or ends turn. Just to waste other people time.)

- Getting Card parks and Tickets. You can get Card packs and tickets till level 16 after that you can't get anything. To get into prise play, you need one ticket. If you don't have it, you have to pay 4.50 EUR for five tickets OR recycle 20 cards to get one ticket to get into prize play mode. Then all you have to do is win 3x to get one ticket 4x to get 1x ticket and 1x card pack and 5x to get 1x ticket and 2x card packs, which is pure luck. Don't even bother with Constructed deck prize play because there are people, who play with OP decks. If you want to win best is Phantom Draft.

-Microtransaction also ruins the game. People who love to spend money get Strongest cards of the game, build decks and destroys everyone else who is playing in a fair way. (In my opinion, this is the reason why Artifact's player count is dropping so fast. Imagine you're a new player and you get destroyed by op decks, without a chance to win, also cards which can confuse new players. VALVE What you could do about it? Look at Hearthstone for example. You can't buy cards just card packs, skins, Campaigns. Also, They have brawl game mode( just like a prize play) where you collect in-game gold by doing quests, and you can enter this mode. In there People can earn Card card dust or basic card pack.) Microtransactions are not needed. They a game PAY TO PLAY TO PAY more.

-Too much game modes. Featured mode|| Solo play=>Bot match/Bot Challenge|| Standart play=>Global Matchmaking/Constructed/Phantom Draft|| Social Play=>Open Play/Challenge a Friend/ Tournaments|| Prize Play=>Constructed/Phantom Draft/Keeper Draft
Why would you need that much? I don't get it...

-This is my individual opinion. But Can you add more animations for Imps?  It's sometimes annoying when they act all the time in the same cartoon-ish way. (I mean more animations when your tower gets destroyed. Every time one's Imp farts at the tower, and another imp is dropping his jaw.

Like I said Idea of the game is great, but they really need to fix many things. GUYS IF YOU WANT TO BUY ARTIFACT Wait for summer or winter sale otherwise it's not that worth it.
This is Pay-to-Win and Pay-To-Play to the core. There is no way to win a Casual Constructed Gauntlet, if you don't buy cards. 90% of my opponents has the strongest heroes and cards in the entire collection. The only games I manage to win is casual global matchmaking.
It's really a shame as I think that Artifact has the best gameplay and potential of any card game out there. If they don't fix the economic model, I don't recommand buying the game unless you are ready to put your credit card hero on the table
Just another Pay to Win game. It rely a lot on good cards in order to be on par with other players that spend extra to buy good cards (to build a good deck). Anyway, the hero & spell setting/ merchanism need a lot of improvement. There're many cards that are totally imbalanced, and it really depends on luck to win against these cards. Not a fun game I'd say. The standard is not even 10% of Yugioh, or 20% of Deck Heroes.
HOLY SHIT! what a terrible game. SLOW ASS game with stupid mechanics. I've played only 2 times and its already over 101min with fuckin tuts? now i can't refund it? good job valve. I want refund!!! never buy this game! I've never regretted it so hard
This game fails on a basic level, not as a game, but as a product of one of the most trusted and liked companies ever.
Please, Valve read our reviews and give us the changes we, because this is a MASSIVE waste of a game and consumer trust. Paying for consmetics is one thing, paying for the actual content and reason to play after you already bought a game is simply ridiculous.

-I really like the DOTA2 themed card game and it's inovations and ideas
-It has great mechanics, animation and voiceacting
-Easily one of my favourite games so far


HOWEVER, what Valve is doing is oureageous. Many other games like Hearthstone, Duelist or Shadowverse are at least free when you start them. This game costs almost 20$ just for 10 packs and the oportunity to pay more.
Yes, you can play constructed, but dont expect to get far without throwing at least 3 times as much.
The ONLY redeeming quality is to play casual draft.

I am deeply disappointed that a game like Valve can do something like this, as many of us thought that they understood what games are about. They have milions of fans that would even buy the game for 30$ no problem, but at least give us some decent features in the game exept the MASSIVE CON of an external economy that even rivals the real world's.

To play this game you should have very powerful card... credit card!

I'm sorry, but this game is just pure cash grab. I did not expect it from Valve, who has created so many good games so far
TCG where you can trade digital cards for 15% fee and can't easily cash out with real money. Thanks, but no thanks.

Also, I don't know what was Valve thinking when they decided they will let public beta testers to collect cards for almost 2 weeks in advance and then letting them sell cards on the market few hours before official release.

As of gameplay, this game went a little too far with RNG effects in my opinion, I guess to make it feel like "it can't be solved". Many of those effects are just not fun for one player in game (either effect works and opponent is unhappy about it, or effect didn't work and you are unhappy about it). That even inculde the arrows for unit attacks, it feels so damn bad when your hero dies because random creep decided to attack it instead of going straight to the tower. There is some room for tactical gameplay and strategical planning, but in the end I felt like the game just lacks in fun department for me.

The RNG aspect stays still the same, it is in fact what forced me to unistall the game. There were situations where creep + hero and arrow placements in first few rounds decided the game. Enemy could easily damage my tower and get gold from killed heroes and I couldn't prevent anything. In few cases good opponent draws/starting hands also decided the game. It works both ways I guess and that's rng I can live with in card games, but still my opponent probably wasn't very happy when it happened to him. In the end, if you don't like losing to RNG this game will make you angry on regular basis.

I played only phantom draft. Keeper draft when you compare it to other real TCGs is just negative EV (expected value for people not familiar with the term). In MtG or Hex you could win packs you used to enter the draft (for instance, in Hex you could win 5 packs for 3 wins, and 3 packs for 2 wins, queue was 1$ + 3 packs, and it was also keeper draft). As you can see, skilled player could easily build collection and still draft (just by selling extra packs on auction house), less skilled player could sell cards and still draft. Going infinite was a thing, and it had some value attached. 

In Artifact you get 2 tickets and 3 packs for 5 wins, with means you will always have to buy at least 2 packs if you want to play more. If your drafted cards/packs were bad (low value), you will have to give Gaben some dosh to go on with keeper draft.

Now let's go back to Hex for a second again. Because playerbase was shrinking in Hex, they changed draft to something similiar too what Artifact have, cost to enter was 1$, you played to 3 wins or 2 loses. 0-1 wins - 0 packs (I think it was changed to 1 random rare later), 2 wins - 2 packs, 3 wins - 6 packs. As you can see, it's not as great as regular draft, but still much better than what Artifact gives.

And to be fair, don't play Hex either, game was badly managed and it is dead now. I'm just using this game as comparsion, because that is the last TCG I played.

Ok, let me show you some data from my phantom drafts with my 5 initial ticekets:
1)   3:2 - ticket
2)   5:1 - ticket + 2 packs
3)   2:2 - 	
4)   4:2 - ticket + 1 pack
5)   5:0 - ticket + 2 packs
6)   1:2 -
7)   5:0 - ticket + 2 packs
8)   3:2 - ticket
9)   4:1 - ticket + 1 pack
10) 2:2 -
11) 5:1 - ticket + 2 packs
12) 1:2 -
13) 0:2 -

Win rate: 67.7% (40 wins / 59 total games = 0.677)

Got very unlucky at the few last games, or as I imagine it to protect my fragile ego, Valve flagged my account so I started to recieve all the worst rng. All in revange for my initial negative review :)

About packs, I opened my 10 packs and all the packs I won and sold all the cards that still had some value. Valve giving me my 10 packs with 3h delay and early open market for beta testers meant I earned ~1/2 of what I could get if I would have fair chance on the market (if not even more). Can't complain as I got the game for free, but it still makes me little disaapointed it was handled that way.

After cards I sold on the market I still had enough cards to make 8 more tickets, but after I lost my last ticket from the initial 5 I decided it is definitely not a game I will enjoy, also the value to the time investement is just not there. So I just sold all the commons/uncommos. In the end after 32h of playtime I have 22$ extra in my steam wallet . Considering half of the packs were from draft, you can say that after 30h and win rate of ~67%, you can make 11 bucks (or simply you get 1 pack every 3h on average). Don't get hyped about hitting Axe or Drow, there are high chances you will get great rares like Watchtower, value ratio is not in your favor.

Take what you want from this information, maybe it's a game for you. As for me, I'm not going back to Artifact.
The game need atleast one way to effectively try Grind to earn cards without actually investing anything extra apart from the 20$ that we are already paying .. Even a weekly free deck would make me want to invest my time on this .. The game itself is amazing and i really wish i didn't have to spend 5$ each time i run out of event tickets..
i really like card games and mechanically this game is pretty neat (likely due to Richard Garfield's involvement) but the internal economic system provides no way to expand your collection and compete in some of the potentially more competitive and high-skill game modes, such as ranked competitive play.

event tickets are the currency used to enter game modes wherein you have the chance to win that ticket back and potentially earn a couple of packs. you are provided with 10 packs and 5 tickets to start with. if you open these 10 packs and get garbage rares worth nothing on the marketplace, and you exhaust the 5 tickets provided, you currently have no way to earn a single more card other than to pour more money into the game, or 'game' the marketplace with your current cards in the hopes of turning a profit.

the ability to make beneficial trades to increase the value of your collection is something seen in physical card games (such as Garfield's 'Magic: The Gathering'), and the decision to allow users to buy, sell and trade cards is a welcome one. however, physical card games like MTG provide players with opportunities to engage in weekly local contests (such as Friday Night Magic events) at little to no cost - and at these events, you can potentially earn new packs or cards, and trade with and meet other players.

the mechanics of this card game in themself are very interesting, fun to play with, and make for consistently close games. they've managed to make every game a challenge, and there is a good balance of opportunities for skillful play and roll-of-the-die chance that makes for a really fun time. but the combination of a pretty malicious monetization scheme (for a PAID pc game) and the complete lack of any social play means that i can't in good faith recommend this to anyone.

tl;dr: really interesting card game with a terrible monetization scheme and a lack of social play opportunities. if you have a lot of expendable income and an interest in card games check it out, if you don't.. don't
Above average gameplay, trash Valve operations.
They use no daily quests and no free packs making CCG players disappointed. 
Then use unlimited 55% off enraging TCG players and everyone who purchased earlier.
FINE.
I have never written a review before, but I will make an exception for this one.

The game is irritating, you get 5 card packs which makes no difference at all because it has no balance. If you dont want to spend extra money in card boosters, the only way to get boosters are either with tickets, or leveling Up. Good luck on that, because you will face opponents 20, 30 levels higher than you with way better cards. You get nearly no XP after each match (20 to 50) when you need 1000 or more to level up in the beggining.

Matches can last for more than half an hour, depending on the situation, and the way that cards are deployed on the battlefield and attack adjacent cards are completely random! Even if you play right against opponents with cards way better than you, make no mistakes and understand the mechanics of the game, you still need to be lucky!!

This game should be free to play, and then ppl could decide if they spend money or not with cards. Totally deserved my review so that no one else wastes more money on this piece of unbalanced garbage!

Even though i like playing this game, it's obvious that valve fucked up big time with the monetizing model itself.
Mechanics wise its an alright card game, here's my gripe, i didnt know how heavily restricted it was behind paywalls once you got in so i wanted my refund, steam is refusing it on the terms "that i used ingame items" the ingame items i used was the free packs i got for doing the tutorial and on this ground theyre refusing a refund, so 0/10 due to horrible business practices both when it comes to paywalls in an already paid for game and for refusing refunds on bullshit grounds.
So unblanced its unreal. waste of time and money. Almost like there never going to make cards balanced when they can make money off them from the market.

Also the "MM" doesnt exist
If you see this review.
You are lucky.
This game is not a Free Game at all.
All the cards you have to buy for it. Mostly the card is like 0.11ish or something but if you want to win alot. You have to spend like 40~50ish to get the best deck.
And also is not even fun. There is a ticket system. If you spend one ticket then you could go for "expert play".The most person has best deck won.And you can not lost 2 times, you have to win 5 games in a role or only lose one time in 6 games. If you win 3 games+ you could get your ticket back. if you already lost 2 games. byebye ticket. 5 dollars 5 ticket. that is all. image if you lost all day.
PAY2WWIN
Not like heartstone you have daily quest to finish to get some Free golds.
Is fun. but is not fun when this game eating your money.
DO DO DOD OD OD DO DO OD OD D NOT BUY THIS FKING TRASH GAME
As a fan of MtG, I found this game seemed overly complicated for what it was trying to achieve. Seems to rely heavily on RNGeesus and buying packs to be able to build any sort of deck.

Considering how Dota is free to play, this game is outstandingly expensive - having to not only purchase the game, but also buying packs, cards and event tickets with real life money! If Valve were to add a feature which allows us to earn in game currency we could trade for packs and cards then perhaps it miiiiiight be worth it, but I would not recommend this game as it is in its current state.

The animations are very pleasing, but the mechanics are difficult to learn and not very well taught in the tutorial ; but then again Dota isn't exactly easy to learn either... (but dota IS FREE!)
For newbies - 
Open the ten packs. If u get Axe, sell it for 25USD then use all tickets and close the game.
                                  If u dont get Axe, use all tickets and close the game.
U have no way to get any cards without paying for either packs or tickets.
Fun to play, but only for extreme hardcore players.

Annoyingly long games (worsened by never-ending animations), tons of RNG, no progression and pay-to-play.

Can't see this as anything more than a cash grab.
Artifact is an empty shell of a game that failed to learn from the mistakes of its predecessors, it is predatory and wholly in opposition to the common player, who will only feel overwhelmed and outcast from an already stale metagame that garentees they will never have the buying power to contend with the best players.

Artifact is pay to win, and features no form of free progression. The £16 that you pay to enter to the game, does not garentee you the same value as any other player, you are gambling whether your 10 welcome packs will contain expensive cards.

On top of that, many design choices simply don't make sense for the fun of the player. RNG is omnipresent and only serves to become a sources of stress, not a fun gamble. Artifact is not a game that allows you to feel like you're in control.

I would not recommend Artifact until its base price is removed and the Developers show any desire to balance the game with the common player in mind.
Real World Money Centric Economy.
This means you can only buy cards and packs with real money.
Yeah, you will need to pay for the game, than you will need to pay for the cards.
I hope they doesn't make cards regularly, or it will be a real money grabber.
Common VALVE, you are way better than that.
Worst.  Devs.  Ever.  

Did not respond to feedback, instead just made empty promises of updates with ZERO content.  

Nothing to be done, especially if you do... nothing to save your game.
Having almost exclusively played free draft I find some rng aspects too impactful to enjoy the game longterm:

1. Why is there no mulligan?
There are cards to lessen some rng, but how are we supposed to get them in time (ie. 1st turn)?

2. The initial placement + arrows matter A LOT
There will be matches where your first three heroes will die 1st round, you cannot do anything about it and your opponent didnt even have to play a card. There are enough comeback cards - but starting at a significant disadvantage or advantage you had no influence on feels weird..

3. The shop
1 item out of our 9 item deck ? Feels like another layer on rng on the 1st turn rng (prob. better in constructed)

4. The Monetization
just as a preface - I bought the game intending to play only free draft - I more or less got what I payed for even though I wish I could have enjoyed the game a bit more:

no crafting - only card -> ticket conversion (20:1?) - expect good cards to be expensive
 
The monetization is however refreshingly honest - no daily quests, no rewards, nothing to get you hooked and maybe pay  sometime in the future - you like it -> you pay more; you don't -> well thanks for your money. Then you realize they put a fee on "expert play": 
Pay for the game - pay for at least 1 competitive deck - pay to play "seriously" - well valve lost me somewhere in this process. 

5. Conclusion:

If you just want to play a card game casually from time to time the price is a bit high but you might enjoy it. (buy on sale?)

The p2w aspects are not that bad in artifact, but the game asks for a lot investment upfront and even then it leeches cents for "expert play"..
Artifact is a well-presented and unique card game that is fatally dictated by a prominence of RNG which can negate any powerful plays and sway matches unfairly. Despite having 3 lanes, the game is fairly restrictive on where cards are placed - you can only play matching coloured cards in the same lane so if you're light of one colour in a lane and the RNG doesn't deliver draws to mitigate this; you can lose just by bad luck alone. 

The business model of pay to play, pay more to compete and pay even more to win isn't quite as bad as first feared especially with card prices sliding however despite its stylish aesthetics and DOTA 2 lore; the game feels rather drab and not worth investing in unlike comparable games in the genre. The population is also quite low and many still seem on the fence about truly committing to the product.

This is definitely not the quality game I was expecting - Valve have made some small strides early on with adding progression and improving balance but the one thing than cannot be fixed is the fundamental RNG which is the foundation of this game. Strategy can win matches no doubt especially with well-established decks of experienced players but at its core, RNG can prove too much of a factor for most players. 

*Also this game will try and bait you into opening your free packs - if you do this, you will lose the right to refund. 

Not yet. Wait until valve fixes it. 

Pros: 
The voice acting is good, 
lore is interesting 
3D art and animation is stellar.  
There are interesting modes that don't require owning lots of cards
A full collection is "only" a hundred bucks. 


Cons:
Card combat: In hearthstone you choose the blockers. In Magic the enemy chooses the blockers. In artifact it is totally random and automated.  
Card variety: Most of the cards just minor stat variations
Card balance:  Rare cards are often stupidly powerful and straight upgrades of common cards.
Card market: nearly every card is worthless, except the OP cards that are over priced and in every deck 
Card mechanics:  the card text is inconsistent and many mechnics are unintuitive
Deck progression: there was none until the community demanded it, and then it was just slapped on in a shallow miserly way. 
Game feel: It is difficult to play many games in a row, each game requires a lot of attention and feels tiring

It appears that Valve landed on a broken experience early and then polished it to a mirror sheen. They will probably fix it, but its hard to know when since they aren't communicating. Not worth getting into as a main game, but it may be worth paying $20 just to see the Valve game that flopped.
First, BOTH Magic and KeyForge are more dynamic with more surprise actions. Artifact is also not bad as gameplay, it shines. But it's kinda slower.

The only serious issue with this game is the business model. While you CAN sell your cards to buy other cards, you lose value in the general time due to fees. All other TCGs or CCGs do allow some progression without spending money. Magic Arena, Hearthstone being nice examples. 

Basically, this is a "Credit card game", this is what I dislike in it even if it's innovative it just does not fit well. 

Do I recommend? No. Better play KeyForge physical.
BUYERS BEWARE:
This game contains a “Starter Pack” that is given after the tutorial. Once it’s open, no request to refund will be considered. This is intentionally imbedded in the game, and Steam customer service will not consider this as an extenuating circumstance.


Additional packs of cards require more investment. In general, the more you buy, the higher chance of winning a public match you will have, with little, if any, regard to your skills. 

Why can’t Valve continue the Dota 2 business model, which new players enjoy playing and experienced players pay willingly for items that don’t affect gameplay (so as not to deter those don’t want to pay now but may consider paying later).? Why collecting a huge down payment and reducing the number of players significantly? Hope the customers can teach Valve a lesson.
Needless to say, do not buy this game.
In spite of the incestious ethically questionable marketing, the game failed to gain an audience at launch. The gameplay is so random, you can't tell if you are playing the game, or the game is playing you. Majority of the events that happen in a game are decided by RNG. The game was designed this way to make each game feel grand in scale while keeping player input to a minimum. Playing against someone feels like a competition in taking a picture with a dozen cats. Your input is there, but the cats decide in the end.

Playing the game is such a chore, the it lost 99% of its player base in two months. This had quite an impact on the market that Valve had such high hopes for. 

On the topic of Valve, they abandoned this project at the first sign of trouble. 

It's a dead game, abandoned by its players and developers. I would only recommend buying this game if you are really intersted in game design and want to see what not to do.
Artifact intrinsically is a fun game. However, it's not worthy of investing money into. I have opened 10 packs, used my starting 5 tickets and bought a budget deck for $13.21 to play constructed.

The game doesn't tell you any of the rules for keeper draft. It doesn't tell you you can only pick one hero per round.

The game doesn't tell you you can only do one phantom draft every 30 minutes. It locks you out if you want to practice your drafting.

The game doesn't tell you that if you're a novice player you will get destroyed in any of the ticket entry games. I received 0 prizes from my 5 tickets plus 1 (traded cards in tickets).

The game doesn't tell you what your MMR is so you don't know where you stand or why you are losing.

The game doesn't tell you if you are actually playing against humans. It's so lonely in there.

The game doesn't tell you what happened in the match because there is no replay functionality. I want to improve my game!

I constantly get disconnected. When I reconnect I cannot zoom out or view other lanes. If I disconnect while looking at a lane that is not being played I cannot play cards.


You should get 1 free ticket every day to give me a reason to actually try expert play. It's not worth the money investment when I know going in that I will lose.
I am a big fan of dota and card game, so I expected a lot from this! Yet it gave me some disappointments.
1/ Gameplay: Creative, 3 lanes impacting others is a new concept; 2 towers or 1 ancient. great
2/ Card trading/selling/buying: Not really a good idea. since you can have anything you want with money., it decrease the desire and joy having new pack and open them, I mean "I have a good deck and beat everyone, what's now ?"
3/ Players: No idea because we rarely talk. and what to talk about ? Our next moves ?
4/ META DECK: A SUPER SUPER BAD THING IN CARD GAME. all I see around 20 matches were the OP lame and same heroes, creeps, spells, if this is okay with Dota 2 because the heroes are free and there are various choices, and player's skill is key. Cards play 80% of chance to win here. (It's called card game duh)
CONCLUSION:
Sounds good, doesn't work !
I sold all card in the game like another way of refund (round 80% if initial cost), It was fine but i would not recommend this untill they have more choice of powerful deck and less OP cards.
The game is by no means bad, but the fact that it is made incredibely hard to obtain packs without forking over more money tips it onto the negative side for me. The game does not allow for you to learn a lot about the game without either paying a lot of attention to videos and streams of the game or experimenting with the various cards and gamemodes, but if you want more cards to experiment with, you have to play expert gauntlet which requires tickets. Since you're probably not that good at this point, the risk of you losing tickets is pretty high and sometimes it can be down to RNG. Although I do enjoy the game, I would not recommend it to anyone that is not big into card games and/or does not have a lot of money they are willing to sink into it. I think it would have been much better if Valve had made the game free, and had made packs/tickets cheaper. Note that tickets are almost £5. You could get hours of entertainment buying a good game on sale for that rather than a slight chance of winning 2 packs. e.g. You could get a game like Hollow Knight for around £7 on sale which grants you up to 100 hours of content or you could get 2 tickets or 3-4 packs. Buy at own caution.

EDIT: If you like me, find draft modes more fun anyway, then you can literally just play those on casual and not spending any more money will have no effect. In which case, feel free to buy it. You'd probably enjoy it.

EDIT 2: Valve has added some ways of getting packs and tickets through grinding. However, you can only obtain up to 15 tickets and some more packs, so it will only help a certain degree.
Pay to win. You cannot earn packs any other way than paying money. Steam will not issue a refund as the original packs which you open when you start the game have been opened.
Money,Money and more Money.  If you dont plan on spending money ontop of the $19.99,matter how good you are you'll lose. Another money trap by valve. I warned you!
pay2pay, game forces you to spend money to play competitive game modes. no other wat to get tickets for competitive game modes, no ingame currency. all the game wants is your money ^_^
A very sad story.

Game had thousand of bad reviews on day one based on monetisation of the game.
Valve did not act, nor did they communicate with fans.

Never forget you make games for us to enjoy, we are not only wallets.

Its just not fun enough to play with. I played draft for most of the time since construct is just a big joke. In draft you would spend hours struggling to out play other players, and if the rediculous amount of RNG, whether its the drafting, drawing, or attacking arrors, happen to be favoring your side, you will get a reward that is so pitiful its basically insulting. If you lose on the other hand, you will get mostly nothing but painful memory of getting swamped by some lucky guy. I had high hope for this game, I gave it more than enough of my time, and I am unistalling it. Not worth buying.
How humbling it must be for Valve to have their own game struggling to hold onto 'Mixed' reviews.  $12 to play one (1) draft.  That should say enough.  Anyone defending this is simply arguing that you should play only with the terrible 'starter cards' from now until the end of time.

Of course, Valve's extremely defensive posture regarding their refund policy on this should be a colossal red flag to anyone with a semblance of intelligence.  Unfortunately, I fell victim to the marketing hype.  I'm here to recommend you stay away.  The game and its concepts simply do not work with this tiny card collection.

I played Magic competitively for several years.  Every set had hundreds of cards.  There were dozens of sets.  The complexity worked because there were options.
Artifact has... 100 cards?  Maybe?  Doesn't work.
Would have been great if you could at least win cards and packs by playing. This is a money grab game and is utter disgusting that Valve did this to a great game. Dota is completely F2P but this is completely Pay2Play. Absolute abomination of a game :(
I will explain this is very simple terms. If you came here to play Artifact instead of Hearthstone because you were tired of all the RNG that existed there, like I did, the best path for you to take is not touch Artifact at its current state at all. There are so many RNG factors in this game like Ogre Magi, unit placement, etc on top of having bland mechanics like retaliate(damage return) and all that you just want to stay away from this game at its current state. I am a very avid card-game lover and if you are here for a game like Magic, stay far far away from this game. 0/10 Not recommended.
All CCG == Credit Card Game and Payment Simulator 2018 jokes aside, I didn't find the game fun. While it definitely has unique mechanics and high production value, the gameplay itself didn't click with me and business model I disagree with definitely did not help.

Please note that this is just my personal opinion - you may find the game fun, so I would suggest checking it out yourself, as you can always refund it before reaching 2h mark / claiming card packs that come with the initial purchase.
I bought this game 2 hours before launch thinking there might be a preorder bonus and technical there was. It was the call to arm even pack thing that wasnt said anywhere on the store page. I give them props they did make a well made game played a few matches against some friends one of mine had insane cards so i was beat very easily so i looked at his deck and opened in the deck builder and it would cost me 7.66$ to make his exact deck (top kek P2W) not only that but when i got the even cards I thought those were the preorder stuff. it wasnt it was basically a trap as soon as you open just ONE you cannot refund the game.  TO THOSE WHO WANT TO GET THIS GAME BEWARE OF THIS INCASE YOU WANT TO REFUND IT
Unique impression: Pay2Progress:
Player with 5 years of competitive CCG experience here. I've played about 12 phantom and keeper drafts, resulting in 6 perfect runs and found myself left with 7 packs and 0 tickets.

And at this point I faced (and all of Artifact players will) something that I haven't ever seen in any game I played. 
- THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF PROGRESS WITHOUT PAYING -

Now I'm completely fine with Pay2ProgressFaster (like in most of card games) or even Pay2Win, when the average quality of rare card is a lot better than the basic. But here is other story. Once you ran out of tickets, there is no way at all to get a single card without paying (buying pack or packs+tickets). Nada. There are no quests, no new player bonuses, no card rewards for any of the free events.

It took me 4 days of playing to realize it. Although the game interesting and skill-intensive (but enourmosly random compared to any other card game), this Pay2Progress issue is real and built-in the game.  

Hope this review will help players that are not sure if they want to buy Artifact. Make an educated decision.
Wanted to refund the game, as it wasn't really what i imagined the game to be. 

Valve declines and says:

"We cannot grant a refund at this time. This purchase included in-game items that have been consumed, modified or transferred.

I never bought something for the game, i just played the first two tutorial matches and thats it. They gave everyone a free card pack, and because of that they don't let me refund it. Some shady shit right there.
Importance of skill: 10%
Importance of RNG: 90%

The result is an unrewarding and frustrating experience, the game in it's current state of design is not fun. I have no doubt Valve will turn this game around into greatness as they have with all of their previous launches, but until then my review remains a thumbs down unfortunately :(
Just a waste of money played for a few hours figured it cant be that bad, no its fuckin 20 bucks for the game ontop of the fact that you cant get anymore cards without spending more cash and you cant get any money out of this game like real tcg in irl. I'd say your better off smoking a joint in two 100 dollar bills than play this shit.
Not sure on this one yet, lots and lots of luck involved in the games (attack directions, creep spawn locations, shop items, initial hero spawn locations). Fingers crossed they tweak it.
I would have recommended the game a few months ago.. However, I can't now.
The game feels ignored by Valve, there has been just one big patch and that's all. No new content, no improvements, no challenges, no stuff added that the community want so much... 
It is a unique game, the idea is very well-done and I think that the game is very enjoyable (I enjoy it much more than any other card games out there). The main thing is, however, the lack of support from Valve, which is very unfortnate and sad. 
Also, there are no achievements, no trading cards, no leaderboard, no visible ranks... 

Do not buy this game untill Valve wakes up and starts doing something in order to properly manage their own game.
Game runs well, looks great and despite an enormous amount of RNG, even for a CCG, it does have some interesting interactions you can make with the mechanics, which are distinct from other CCGs like Hearthstone, Magic, Netrunner etc. So why do I not recommend this game? It’s obviously because of the payment model. You start out with 10 card packs and 5 tickets. You can earn more card packs + tickets by playing in the competitive formats but you need tickets in order to do that so once you run out of tickets there is absolutely no other way to obtain card packs or tickets without paying for them. This would be fairly ridiculous in a free to play game but this game does that after you have payed $20.
This is NOT the game for the general audience, Artifact was made and tailored for the select few, either too rich to care about any costs associated OR people with a solid background of highly-competitive Tabletop Card Games (real-life or digital). Any other person probably won't be able to enjoy it in its current state. If you're looking to broaden your game repertoire or discover the genre, the Artifact is NOT for you. 

First, [u]PROS[/u]. What the game does succeed to present, it presents well.
[list]
[*]The mechanical aspect is superb. It's an amalgam of the familiar tabletop gameplay and some new elements which greatly expands the play-space.
[*]Games are usually close, there are lots of ways of playing from behind to turn tables around.
[*]The card artwork is good. Lots of big names are on the artist list, and it's pretty consistent in all its variability. 
[*]The sound palette is stunning. Every music track is vibrant, distinct and fits the board situation well. 
[*]The lore depth is enormous: Artifact draws from the Dota 2 universe and expands on it, this finds reflection in the sound design: cards interact with other cards present and react to the situation on board. Every card has its voice-acted description and all the characters involved are cross-referenced in one way or another. 
[/list]
Lore and card interactions are actually the main reasons I bought this game.

Second, [u]CONS[/u]. Almost everything above is muddied and made corrupt in one way or the other.
[list]
[*]Aftifact announcement, post-announce management, presentation and beta were horrendous. Several key features promised way before beta are still missing (you can't spectate others in-game, for example) and people feel betrayed by the fact that e-celebs had almost a year of experience before anyone else got to try it. Valve is as silent as ever. 
[*]Monetisation model is questionable. You pay a hefty sum upfront, then you pay to complete your desired deck, there is no way to gain cards other than winning the gauntlet or buying them from the Steam Marketplace.
[*]The frequent complaint is about the RNG nature of the game. I absolutely don't mind it, after all it's all about managing the hand you've been dealt, but there are lots of ways things could go south at any point and step of the game. Tutorials don't cover those in enough depth, so only experience would help.
[*]The receding player base led to a very unfair (skill-wise) match-ups: don't expect to win if you're reading this. People who know what they are doing are the last remaining players in the game. Casual matches are impossible.
[*]The music is fantastic, yet there are only around five tracks (Caravan, Red Mist, Aghanim's Obsession, Immoral Dreams, Fires of Rebellion and main theme?). Those get old very fast, considering the average match goes for at least 20 minutes.
[*]There is no way to exchange cards with your friends (or share a pool of cards when you play tournament), you can't even play 1 on 1 in the same way you can play versus a bot. You can't transfer or share any value in any other way than the Marketplace.
[*]Game optimization is nonexistent. Don't expect it to run well if your hardware is lacking, don't expect it to run at all if you're on a laptop. Prepare to google if you're on linux.
[/list]

Last, [u]CONCLUSIONS[/u]

If you are interested solely in the mechanics of the game, you could play javascript draft simulator, javascript artifact clone, in fact those tools were made by the community even before the open beta.
If you fell in love with the Lore, the comics and dota2wiki will probably make your day.
If you like the OST, you can find all the tracks on youtube.

There is simply no reason to buy this game right now, it's not worth the money for the average gamer.
Huge RNG based game. No control over the initial state of the game. No control at all over the minion spawn or even behavior (who they attack). If you want to influence all the bad RNG effects and revert the initial mess, good luck getting around it with a 3 mana pool starting state. Really difficult to catch up from a random bad starting point. Sometimes it feels you have little to do in some matches.

Good idea poorly executed.
Pay to Win after Paying for the game.
Gacha in a $25 game? You serious, valve?

And unnecessarily consume too much resource for a card game,
buy it only when they sale it for $5, I guess...
I have played Gwent and Hearthstone and honestly just find this game boring. There is no progression to speak of and no persistent leaderboard (even though Valve says that this is their top priority I have little faith in them actually releasing this in a timely manner). The animations are slow and they only way to earn packs and tickets requires you to be incredibly talented at deck building which I beilieve the majority of players are not (including myself). For the time being I would recommend giving this game a pass until more features are added.
Can't recommend in its current state. It's just a money sink with no incentive to play casually. Even if you win you still feel like a loser because either way you get nothing.
I want to address fundamentally what is wrong with this game.

- Not having a ladder on day 1

- Later patched progression systems were a huge let down.

- card prices weren't a big issue as I managed to make back most of the steam money I fed into the game.

- RNG affects some of the most important aspects of gameplay that I found very unsettling for a game deemed to be competitive.

That's really about it, but from a competitive standpoint, this game feels very much like Gwent in how alot it is a game of math. If you really want to play a card game, go play Slay the Spire or Hearthstone. Very disappointed in Valve.
MY RATING: the money that you invested/10




1. UNBALANCED! 
IT IS EXTREMELY HARD TO WIN WITH CHEAP & BUDGET COMBINATION OF CARDS AGAINST RARE & EXPENSIVE CARDS
NO MATTER YOU TRY TO WIN WITH JUST CARD COMBINATIONS AND YOUR CARD PLACEMENT SKILLS,
WITHOUT LUCK ON YOUR SIDE, YOU CANNOT BEAT PEOPLE WHO INVEST REAL MONEY.

2. IS THIS A GAME OF SKILL OR A GAME OF LUCK? (obviously most card games are both but STILL!)
AND WHAT IF YOU INVESTED REAL MONEY AND BOUGHT RARE CARDS, WELL TOO BAD FOR YOU, SUCKER! BECAUSE YOU STILL NEED TO BE LUCKY TO WIN.

YOU CANNOT CONTROL YOUR CREEPS (well there are some cards that enables you to BUT NORMALLY YOU CANT, ITS FREAKING RANDOM LIKE A STUPID AI)
YOU CANNOT CONTROL YOUR HERO PLACEMENT WITHIN THE LANE (LIKE WTF? IF YOU ARE UNLUCKY, YOUR HERO WILL DIE IN TURN 1, GIVING YOUR ENEMY 5 GOLDS, BASICALLY ALREADY LOSING THE GAME IN TURN 1)

3. THERE HAS TO BE MORE UPDATES
THERE HAS TO BE MORE WAYS TO OBTAIN FREE CARDS OR DUST OR SH!# OR SOMETHING
THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO OBTAIN CARDS JUST BY PLAYING AND INVESTING PLAYER'S TIME IN THE GAME

THE GAME CLIENT FEELS LIKE BETA OR SOMETHING
THE GAMEPLAY FEELS UNFINISHED AND THERE ARE GRAPHIC BUGS EVERY NOW AND THEN.

>>>>BEST OP CARD IS YOUR MAMA'S CREDIT CARD<<<<
pay $20 to play the game, Pay another $50 just to be able to win a single match, gameplay concept is good but the heros are unbalenced to the point where its down right ridiculous.
Pay for the game, pay for the cards, pay to play for rewards, no ladder, hard to watch, needs balancing, Valve wont say anything over a month. Do not buy at the current state.
What I liked - looks alright, pretty good concept of making moba card game. I mean if you ever played dota you'll enjoy seeing how they adapted the heroes into the game.

The rest... every turn takes so long, still seems like a lot of randomness can screw you over. And of course the constant expectation that you are going to pay to play. 
Well, it's not for me. I paid enough for my computer and setup, I'm not going to add games where I have to 'insert coins' to keep playing.
Gameplay and idea is awesome, but the whole market place trading cards and selling ruins it when you got no missions in-game to earn more cards by just playing. It's pretty sad I made $30 selling the cards I had opened and made my money back from this money grabbing mess of a game.
Great Game, too bad it's a dead game with no future, even Dota Auto Chess has more hope than this.
Yes I do own all the cards (roughly 250+ euro wasted)

Since November 2018 they didn't bother to improve and with the very few people playing it, there is no hope for a future expansion. (I mean who would like to spend 200+ euro for another set, I might be stupid but not that stupid)

I mean it has like 50 views on twitch....
I loved this game. I really wanted this game to be great and I bought into it hard but the recent change to the buy in cutting back on the amount of tickets and packs you get for just buying the game because they added a weak ass progression system is going too far. Valve needed to take the L on their profits for new players sake but have in my opinion shown that they're on damage control and player retention before the game is even out a month with a bleeding userbase. Sure this may be the most played card game on Steam and sure it may have the highest production value and polish but it is not the best for your money. Play Eternal instead.
Good Game but nor recommended, still new and need many development in balancing card... and ofcourse if you want a good card then you need to pay for the card although it can be resold its value will drop for certain after new expansion as it wont be as relevant as current meta, if you fight blue and your opponent sents out "Incarnation of Selemene" then you will 100% certainly lose the lane unless you have removal which is very scarce and will only be a weight if you hold the card for too long, so you need to beat blue type deck before they can get 9 mana. However its so hard to get through the tower as they kept stalling with aoe spell, spamming creeps summoning and annoying improvements that can deal up to 4 damage before action phase if you are late dealing with it. As I said before, removal are unique and scarce and its annoying when you fought with people that strategies are stalling game for 15 mins and ends up using that "Selemene" which can spam all their card in their hands, with green help it will be unstoppable! UNLIMITED MANA + UNLIMITED BUFFING!! If you ask me why I rant so much about the deck and why not use the deck instead is because I want to see many different decks that are viable to play and not only 1 to 2 decks that run the game, and as current meta, I will safely say that you won't beat any blue/green deck unless you are a more experienced player than your opponent and have a very good starting hand that can destroy 2 towers before they can get 6 mana. If you are using Blue/Green and fights with the similar deck then its just a matter of luck of whom is winning. Drow Ranger are also one of the most OP card too, her silence can make you unable to use hero skill and play any card for one turn. I wish I could refund the game and sell all those useless cards that I got.
Great TCG ruined by bad RNG and awful monetization win 3 games just to go through to play 2 people with $60+ decks impossible to get a 5 streak in its current state without spending $100's on packs or decks easy P2W systems and dont get me started on the RNG of squishy blue heros constantly being placed in front of axe because the player doesnt have the ability on where to place cards.
Pay to win and no refunds cause of garbage refund. Here pay 20 to play and we will give you somethings but if you use things we gave you no refund. Garbage cash grab will be dead in a few months.
Waste of anything you can imagine including: money, time, mental health, etc. Same random bs as poker, but in poker you don't have to buy cards/tickets to become broke.
Do you like your games with excessive microtransactions ?
Do you like your games with ridiculous amount of RNG ?
And do you like your games with really simple lore and card art ?

Then this is THE game for you, it has everything no one asked for.
Very disappointed in the changes to the 10 packs and 5 tickets that came with the original purchase but changed in 21st December for everyone no matter when the game was brought. No message advising this was a time sensitive offer. Left a very sour taste in the mouth and abhorrently anti-consumer. I want to keep playing and buy more cards but cannot bring myself to do so after this
A new low for Valve. 

Dota2 -> no base fee to play -> can aquire items randomly for free just for playing -> Valve makes ridiculous amounts of money off of microtransactions -> game is free so people are more apt to give it a try

Artifact -> base fee to play -> cannot aquire any items/cards ingame no matter how long you play-> Valve makes ridiculous amounts off of microtransactions -> game isnt free so it's playerbase is barred

I'm disappointed in valve for going down this path. They will make absurd amounts of money off of players buying/selling cards on the steam market (5-10% of every single item sold on the market this way depending on the game). It seems in more recent years steam has been 'losing face' to attract more playerbases to become shackled to their platform. Valve has really gone downhill trading it's good reputation to further capitalize their monopoly.

TLDR: pure greed. Valve will make more than enough in microtransactions from this game; and having no way to earn in game cards/items will hinder the playerbase and their reputation as a company.
While the average Artifact game is more enyjoyable and strategic than any other card game I've played (let's stop calling Artifact a TCG when there is no trading at all), my problems with the game lie with not the monetization (which I think is bad, but not quite as bad as many would have you believe), but the RNG. 

Card games inherently have RNG via drawing cards, and it's unavoidable and not worthy of discussion. Artifact has more RNG than any other card game that I've played due to the fact that its very fundamental mechanics are built upon RNG. Heroes and creeps are deployed randomly within a lane you choose. When placed, they attack via a 50% chance to hit straight across, and a 25% chance to swing left or right. Cheating Death is the single-most complained about card when RNG is involved. What does it do? When played, each Green hero in the lane played has a 50% chance to not die to lethal damage. Coin flips on coin flips on coin flips.

Richard Garfield and Skaff Elias, two of the Artifact game designers, went through design with the mindset that cards will rarely, if ever, be changed in terms of buffs or nerfs, and that they plan to update the game and therefore the meta with new sets. The problem? The hands-off approach leads to a months-long stale meta with, in Artifact's case, cards like Axe and Drow (two cards that are *significantly* stronger than any other heroes) run rampant on those not willing to shell out the market price for the card or the money to gamble on unpacking them. 

While Valve has the final say on what happens to Artifact, i.e. they may nerf cards if met with overwhelming feedback, I don't expect much of the above to change due to how much Valve has already raked in via the market.

TL;DR: Gorgeous card game with interesting (fully voiced) card lore, enjoyable and complex gameplay, marred by RNG in the core mechanics, a poor design philosophy, and by extension a handful of overpowered cards dominating the game and market.
I'm going to do something unique. I'm writing a negative review that isn't about monetization, but about gameplay:

It sucks.

The hero mechanic is just a way to get stunlocked or find yourself staring at a decent card you have the mana for but can't play. That's not fun.

The lanes mechanic is just a nuisance and adds nothing but DOTA flavor, but if you've played CCG's before, you know how quickly your hand can be depleted even with cards to draw cards. The ability to have as many cards in your hand as you want is great, but it loses it's value really fast when you have to split cards across three lanes and only get two per turn to restock--plus anything you bought with bounty.

The bounty system... I don't like it. I understand it's purpose--partly for DOTA flavor and partly as a bag of tricks to help kit out heroes and shore up weak decks and hands, but it's still a garbage system. It's best feature is that you don't have to spend mana to use your bounty bought cards--but that doesn't offset how unwieldy it feels and the overhead of having that shopping phase every single round.

The victory conditions are absurd and built on the desire to have a three lane card game.

But the real killer here is: you have so little control over the things that matter. You don't get to pick what your minions or heroes fight. You don't get to choose blockers. You don't even get to choose where on the table things end up.

I've played a few games and I still don't know what the rules are for creep resupply. It's just another random thing that happens without your input or control every turn. Maybe a lane will get reinforced, maybe it wont. It doesn't even appear to be a consistent number of reinforcements from round to round.

If you always wanted to play a Rubik's cube where the colors were constantly changing, the sides rotated on their own, and  wasn't a cube but a set of three balls you could juggle, and it looked like juggling them was causing things to happen, then this is the card game you've been waiting for.

Alright, so I'm 27 hours in, and while I am enjoying myself, I really don't think I can give this a recommendation.

Underneath these problems there is a great game dying for an expansion or two and some minor tweaks to OP cards.
Had to refund it. The game itself is interesting. It's a nice twist on familar card games. But the paywall is ridiculous. $20 for a game that requires you to buy new cards once you're past the tutorial? Every other card game like Hearthstone and MTG Arena let you unlock cards and packs as you play, you can rank up, do challenges. Artifact? Valve just wants your money. 

If this was a free game with a Pay for Cards option, that'd be different. But basically, this game will always cost you more than $20 unless you have no intentions of improving your deck
Pros:
1. Great Concept.
2. Great Theme.
3. Great Graphics.

Cons:
1. Bad pricing model.
2. Cards are way too imbalanced.
3. Bad mechanics.
4. Game is difficult to spectate.

Verdict: 3/10

As a PC gamer / TCG gamer. I had huge expectation for this game. Matter of fact I bought a new laptop so I could play this where ever I go. After understanding the game, I felt like it went to a wrong direction at some point during the game development.
The game's mechanics is probably the worst I have ever played. It's just not up to par to modern standards.
Don't waste time trying to balance the cards. Forget about Richard Garfield. Forget about the money you have spent developing this game. Hire someone else and REDESIGN THE GAME COMPLETELY! Otherwise this is just another hopeless game... just like DOTA 2...
Gameplay is okay until you realize that your 20$ only makes you eligible for human rights and actually being able to spend money, or else you can't do sh*t without spending more money to buy cards.
Valve has taken a pretty creative angle with Artifact and to be honest at its core the gameplay is good and demonstrates the potential for a very high skill cap. I've played around 35 hours or so and I think with the right direction, the game can definitely become much more popular than it is currently. Artifact however faces a lot of issues, I personally only picked up the game after the in-game progression was added, this is because for me personally it feels much more rewarding when you play a game and know that your time invested reaps rewards of some kind, especially in the digital card game space. (I've played Hearthstone, ESL and MTG Arena and the pokemon tcg) With this in mind I think the progression system needs a lot more work, as right now it is a very slow grind in order to get anything, this also nullifies the "buy the game and get x amount of packs" because whereas before you could buy the game and were automatically rewarded with the booster packs for purchasing the game, after the progression update you have to essentially still grind to get the packs you would have got with the purchase before the update which I think is pretty stupid. Keeper draft is also mostly pointless as because of the low player count you will almost always be matched vs streamers or very high skill level players and the matchmaking time is very long additionally the rewards you get for doing well are not really worth the entry fee a lot of the time unless you are an exceptionally skilled player. Keeper draft is also far less forgiving to players who get an average amount of wins in comparison for example to Arena in Hearthstone where someone who is a casual player can still get decent rewards for average results.

Regardless I think Artifact is fun and has a potentially bright future ahead of it if Valve continues to make adjustments to progression and to come up with creative ways to keep the game fresh and exciting and accessible to new players (which  would be a huge boon to smoothing out the matchmaking balance issues).

It's tough to say at this point whether I would recommend the game. It will certainly be interesting to see how the game plays a few months down the line and I'll certainly recommend it if things improve, but until then I'm leaning toward (if you enjoy tcg's) rather wait until Artifact's more glaring issues are ironed out before committing yourself to this one.
Dead on Arrival game that does little to change or forward the genre. Really wish the game was not a CCG and instead had a fixed cost for packs with some changed mechanics to reduce RNG.
If youre new to these types of games get ready to get stomped.  Unless you spend money on cards.  The match making sucks, its pretty obvious theyre pairing newbs like me with people that know what theyre doing and have bought cards.  Makes it a bitch to get used to the game for us newbs.  Wouldnt recommend it unless you know how to play these games.
Oh man i've played TCGs before but this s**t is insane. The RNG is off the charts where one random effect can ruin 30 minutes of carefull planning. Now i know games like this rely on RNG to draw cards but the abilities themselves are a hellhole. The only good thing is the limited time mode that's on right now but I have a feeling its not gonna last. Word of advice if you do buy it, sell all your rare and uncommon cards cause this game unlike DotA wont last long.
I’m going to be ignoring monetization here because you probably already know how you stand on that. 

Artifact has a lot of interesting ideas at its core, but as it stands if you’re at all apprehensive about buying the game I would recommend against it. These are my major issues with Artifact:

[b]Power Levels:[/b] There is an obvious disparity between the power levels of cards. This is most obvious when comparing heroes. Most of them are simply unplayable, due to poor base stats and/or terrible signature cards. While some, such as Crystal Maiden, are clearly supposed to serve some sort of niche, using them is a liability because a stiff breeze will kill them, and they can’t even one-shot the melee creeps that spawn every turn without some sort of investment. Even in draft, there are many cards that are just unplayable, along with a select few that basically guarantee you a win if you manage to draw them (Time of Triumph being the best example). While drafting in Artifact might seem daunting at first, after one or two drafts you’ll realize that >50% of the cards you’re shown are never worth picking. I’ve tried to force blue a few times, but it always seems like I don’t find any of the key cards that I would need (also, most of the blue heroes are terrible), so I just give up and pick the other colors.

[b]Buffs & Nerfs:[/b] The issue of buffing objectively terrible cards is something that could be easily remedied in a digital card game. Unfortunately, at the moment it seems like Valve doesn’t plan on doing this. I can understand the refusal to nerf anything, since it would make all the people with the nerfed card mad, but there are so many cards in this game that are just so bad, and if some of these cards got a few changes maybe there would be more to the game than just picking all the best cards of a specific color and calling it a deck. Draft would benefit too, since increasing the general power level of a set usually makes it more fun. And hey, maybe it would make me feel something other than disgust every time the game forces me to pick Bloodseeker.

[b]Mechanical Space:[/b] The base set is pretty limited in terms of the mechanics that it uses, which means that most cards end up doing the same thing but in a slightly different way. You can see how some alternative strategies could potentially be used (such as focusing on gold generation), but there either aren’t enough cards to support that playstyle, or they get smashed by the cards that are just good in every situation. This is partly why every draft deck feels pretty much the same, is because the design is so straightforward that there really aren’t that many card synergies or draft archetypes. You WILL draft three colors, and you WILL just end up picking the best cards from each color and shuffling them into a deck, and as long as you don’t make any blunders or get unlucky and face a guy with two Drows and an Axe like I did, you should be able to at least break even. This is most likely an issue that will be fixed in later sets, but for now it seems like there are only one or two ways to play the game.

[b]RNG:[/b] There are a lot of RNG effects in this game and while they aren’t as bad as Hearthstone's, having bad luck can be extremely tilting. True, there are ways to play around bad creep deployments and arrow spawns, but it’s definitely frustrating when things just don’t seem to be going your way time and time again. Several cards have in-built RNG which is borderline inexcusable. The biggest offender is obviously Cheating Death, a card which you can play against and do everything right and still lose to because the 50% chance for an enemy to survive a fatal blow procced several turns in a row. Thankfully, if you play draft you won’t have to see this card very often. Cards that you WILL see often are Bounty Hunter and Ogre Magi (okay, maybe you won’t see Ogre as often since he’s blue). Bounty Hunter’s RNG usually only matters in the first few turns, but it can easily lead to a turn 1 or 2 hero kill and 5-15 gold for your opponent which they wouldn’t have gotten otherwise. Ogre Magi’s RNG effect is only set to a 25% chance, but if it procs off of a key spell, like a Thundergod’s Wrath, you’re probably just going to want to kill yourself. Mobility is very important in this game, and the one mobility option that you’ll always have access to (even if you get an unlucky draft) is TP scrolls. TP scrolls don’t always show up in the shop at the end of the turn, though, meaning that, in worst-case scenarios, you’ll be waiting multiple turns for a TP scroll to show up with a hero sitting in a lane being useless, while your opponent’s already evac’d everyone to mid. I’ll pretty much always buy a TP scroll when it’s offered to me, and I’ve still gotten screwed a few times.

[b]Reactive Play:[/b] Maybe this is just me, but it rarely feels like I have a plan when I’m playing. Rather, things occur on a moment-to-moment basis. My opponent plays a buff on his hero which will lead to my hero getting killed at the end of the turn, so I respond with a buff on my hero to give him more health. There are just so many things that can happen in the span of a turn that you’re kind of just forced to go with the flow. I mean, I usually win my games so I must be doing something right, but it doesn’t really feel like I outsmarted my opponent most of the time. Maybe this is something that will change with more experience in the game.

[b]Final Thoughts:[/b] I don’t think that Artifact is completely done for, but I think a lot of the game’s future lies on the second set, especially given the aforementioned “We’re not going to change anything!” policy. There’s a lot of easy fodder for hate right now (Drow, Axe, ToT, Cheating Death…) which isn’t unjustified, but I hope that Valve learns from the problems with the base set and uses that to inform its design going forward.

[b]Taster’s score: C-[/b]
The cost of the game is atrocious. Never seen a p2w like this. No progression through playing, no rewards nothing. Aslo a lot of RNG, and no viability in 90%+ of the decks. 
The balance is bad, since many heroes and just too bad to be played. The shop system is full of RNG, the deployement is full of RNG
On the upside the game looks and play great. But it's honestly not worth to buy it now. Wait a bit and if they actually make smth out of this you might spend your money and time on this thing.
This is a really good game, the best card-game to date, with an AWFUL business model. 
Until they fix it so that you can win decks for free, this is a negative review for me.
If that changes, so it is not milking us dry for cards, then I will highly recommend this excellent game.
Very disappointed with the amount of RNG they put into the game. The random deployment and attack directions are plain stupid. Not even talking about the Cheating Death fiesta... If I wanted to play casino I'd just played HS.
I really want to like this game, it has got alot of potentional and if i see some changes I will definitely change my review. However, at this point, I simply cannot advise you to purchase this game.

As I'm sure youre aware by now, you can purchase the game for £15.99 (or your regional equivalent) and you will recieve a couple of decks, 5 gauntlet tickets and 10 packs. You might be thinking 'hey, not a bad deal' however you are sorely mistaken.

This gives you a small percentage of the cards available which is like 'ok I mean i can build a deck with this'. You're right, you can, however have fun getting absolutely wrecked, keked and decked by people who have spewed money at this game. Some heroes are just flat out better than others, no ifs or buts about it, sure you can build decks around strategies but if you don't have all the cards, you're screwed.

'How do you get packs?' You might be thinking, 'surely there is a free way to do that?' Well yes, you are actually right on that one, just use the gauntlet tickets you've got and go into the draft! Great idea! Oh wait, you're new to the game and wanted to draft to get adjusted to it and learn all the different heroes and cards? Well too bad bucko cause now you've lost 2 games without achieving 3 wins and you get F*** ALL. That's right, no consolitaion prize, no little 'I tried!' medal or anything. Just kicked out and blam.

Oh hey, you can try the keeper draft! Just put in the 5 packs you were given at the start of the game and gamble them all away in hopes of picking out better cards. Oh you can only draft terrible cards? Tough luck, youve lost your gauntlet and gotten no reward besides the atrocious cards you picked up!

Don't worry though, you can recycle cards for gauntlet tickets, only 20 cards for 1 ticket! Oh wait, thats the equivilant to a pack? And if you dont make it to 3 wins you literally just lost everything? Oh wow, great idea Valve!

There is absolutely no reward for playing this game. No achievements, no money to spend on packs, no daily quests, absolutely sweet F all.

TL;DR: Valve are absolutely taking the piss, no rewards for playing, you're gonna get stomped by people who have paid in and there is no way to gain cards without spending money.
Had fun for a bit, but then got really bored of casual play as there's literally NOTHING to gain out of it but the 'joy of the round'. The most fun I had was in Competitve, specifically with Keeper Draft. 

Sadly the event tickets are ridiculous and I'm not paying for those. It's one thing to buy 5 packs to enter into the keeper draft, screw 2 event tickets on top of that. 

Hearthstone has more replayability in casual even, you get like 10 gold after ever 3 wins or something - I wish Artifact would give you like 1 event ticket after every 10 wins or something. Otherwise buying 5 packs, spending 2 tickets, and winning only 2 times so you don't even qualify the reward... HORESHI

*EDIT* to the person who commented below, I still disagree with the cost of the event tickets. Especially needing 2 of them to play a keeper draft on top of the 5 packs, while you only need 1 ticket for other competetive modes. If my friends and I all buy Magic packs and make an impromptu cube match, we can keep all the cards we drew as well but didn't have to for a ticket to play - especially 2 of them.
Let's talk about the elephant in the room. This game is pay to win. It's pay to play. It's pay to everything. That's not a flaw with the game. It's built in. It's open. People who complain about it are missing the point entirely. The pay to win aspect? Not going to affect my review in the slightest.

That said, I'm leaving a negative review... for the following reasons:

The players are slow. I mean -slow-. Like need-to-wear-helmets slow. Mitch McConnell turtle-man slow. They take forever to click buttons even when there's zero choices to be made. I can imagine my opponents sitting there, furiously masturbating when they're winning and delaying clicking the button for that gratification... or conversely sitting there drooling, mouth open and stare blank as they try to figure out what button to click when they're losing.

More than half of my games my opponent has nearly run out of time. Win or lose. I have to watch freaking youtube videos in between my turns just to keep myself entertained. That's not good design.

You know what. I'm gonna leave it at that. No more other reasons why this is a negative review. Please, for the love of all that is holy, add an option for a faster game with half the time limit. Please. Jesus.
I played Artifact since the morning of 29 Nov. to 11pm, I lost all my tickets without win even 1 ticket. the so called "MMR match" is so fake. There is no balanced enemy. Everyone is stronger than me. I played many card games before such as heartstone, magic and Yugioh and there is no card game's environment is bad like this. The very urgent problem Artifact need to fix is how to creat a good gaming environment. Focusing on making the game as hardcore as possible will make the users lost most of their interest honestly. 

I have listed down several drawbacks:

1. The p2w content is huge also, those spend $20 on Axe or the high value card have their win rate boosted largely.

2. Artifact's mechanics are super unfriendly to new-player, You have to spend time on the casual play where there is literally 0 reward!!!! Zero!!!! there is not even a profile to display your win rate.  Then before you lost your interest, you will spend ticket in expert play and no matter which mode you choose, your will lost like shit until your heart is broken simply because this card game is so complicated.

3. As I mentioned in the beginning, MMR is fake, the matching system is not based on win rate for sure.

If you have not bought the game yet, I would like to suggest giving yourself a cooling-off period and consider the purchase really hard while watching the gameplay video and online review to finalize your mindset.
Framework is good, details are every where. Half of the RNG is stupid and pointless. Flop without manual deployment doesn't help newcomers while creating some uncontrolled RNG that could often snowball. Shopping RNG is also just nonsense, opponent might just casually find a Helm of Dom and wins him/her the whole game. Arrows are OK mechanic wise, but feels really baffling. Draft is just gambling. Time of Triumph is as dumb as Ultimate Infestation in Hearthstone. Red/Green ramp make the  constructed meta toxic and dumb as hell. The game's called "who draws ToT first, and more". The remaining players are also bad. I just got bm-ed every single game I lost today. I'd rather play rock paper scissors, it's a deeper gameplay and friendlier communication. So well done GabeN and Richard, and keep investing Auto Chess! Good luck!
A complicated card game with poor onboarding guide and terrible monetization
- You have to pay for the competitive matches to get so called "free" packs even though you have paid 20 bucks for this game. 
- Although there are some free ways to play with evey card, you cannot obtain any of them without buying fucking packs.
- Almost impossible to "go infinite" in draft because of the mmr system guaranteeing a half-half win rate.
- Very complicated system. Too hard for new players who never played TCG or DOTA before.
- Lots of essential gaming mechanics are not mentioned in the guidance.
- Do not accept your "free" rewards! YOU WILL BE  INELIGIBLE TO GET THE REFUND, IF YOU HAVE CLAIMED YOUR STARTER PACKS.
Like any card game you'll have fun for about the first 30 minutes, then lose repetitively in constructed to chinese-named players willing to drop $200 on an overpowered deck, then lose repetitively in draft mode to players who somehow drew top-tier meta decks while you draw yet another pair of common "change target" spells to put in your forced four-color deck. I don't know why I thought buying this game was a good idea, so spare yourself my problems and buy a couple drinks instead, at least that way you'll get one evening's worth of fun out of your money.
I hope Artifact will eventually become a great TCG. As it stands now it suffers from imbalance, lack of progression, lack of rewards, and lack of social communcation. There are some great foundational peices in place, but I wish Valve would have waited and had a longer beta phase. I look forward to Valve taking feedback and creating a great game eventually.
Let me start off by saying that I think the gameplay itself is wonderful, It has depth, it's enjoyable, and it's challenging. Now the issue I have is that there is basically NO WAY to get cards for free aside from the ones they give you when you start. You HAVE to buy more cards unless you win phantom draft every time in order to get your tickets back. Also, if you open up the packs they give you at the start, you are unable to refund the game. There is NO NOTICE of this anywhere. If the game was free to play, this would at least be somewhat excusable, but the game is $20 and still pay to win. Don't buy it until they add some way to get free cards.
I really wanted to love this game, but the monetization model and the length of the matches are way too much for me. The game design is perfect, and really deep. 

I think i will buy it again later if there will be a more rewarding casual gamemode and a better monetization model. But as it is now, i don't recommend to buy it.
I was really excited for this game to come out, but it's been a disappointment playing it. It's very pay-to-win where having a certain card almost guarantees a win. Yes, there are ways to earn packs for "free", but this involves BUYING a ticket to participate in the Expert Play to try and win packs and earn back your ticket. Now this would be fine, if Expert Play wasn't filled with OP cards and combos where it's near impossible to get 3 wins just to earn back your ticket, let alone get 4 or 5 wins to earn packs. There needs to be some *major* balancing changes to some of the cards because they can outright win or lose a lane just being on the board. In addition to the whole pay-to-win fiasco, there is just so much RNG that it's very unlikely that you're actually able to pull off the combo that you want with your deck, especially so for free-to-play players who don't have the fleixibility in their decks in order to compensate for when they get screwed over by RNG. This game has a lot of potential, but in its current state, don't play it unless you want to spend a minimum amount of $50~
DO NOT TRIAL THIS GAME - NO REFUNDS CONFIRMED

Valve will refuse to refund it, even if you havent played PvP or traded cards or anything.  I played under 1 hour and I was able to select refund but they contacted me refusing to refund on the basis "I might have traded cards", clearly their game and I didnt.


I had high hopes for Artifact, but in the end the results are mixed.

Pros:
--Polished UI
--Nice art
--Nice mechanics
--Nice music and sfx

Cons:
--PTW. Competitive decks cost a lot of money.
--Not just PTW, but competing in events is "pay to enter".
--Economics are completely tilted in Valve's favor: I opened 10 packs ($10 value) and got about $4 worth of items. Really?

Conclusion? Check it out if you're a die-hard CCG fan, but be wary. Valve didn't execute this well. They got very greedy with the business model
Somehow, this game ended up in my library, I have no interest in Dota or Card Games, but it randomly showed up, so why not try it?

I have to admit, it was more fun than I expected and I can definitely see the appeal, the 3 lane board also makes things much more interesting, I can't really go in depth since I have no real experience with card games.

Other than that, the art and general look of the game is really nice and slick, I'd love to delve in deeper really but the monetization in this game really hinders me, and if I look at the other reviews, it seems I'm not alone in this and I do hope that Valve listens to this criticism coming from the community, so more casual card game players can delve into Artifact.
"Artifact offers the deepest gameplay and the highest-fidelity experience ever seen in a trading card game."

Deepest RNG gameplay ever and the most infuriating experience you will ever see in a card game that was suppose to be "SKILL COMPETITIVE GAME" also trading card game with no trade at all.

Lets talk about the RNG first :

- First round Heroes deployment RNG (you can't even choose which lanes your heroes goes in the start)
- Creep spawn RNG deployment (0 to 2 creeps will be random add to your lanes in random combat positions)
- RNG in items in the shop phase (You don't even have control over your item's deck why did we even made them in the first place?)
- RNG in deployment phase when deploying a new hero (you can chose the lane but not the combat position)
- RNG when attacking with your units (even when attacking with your hero you just have 0 control in your board UNLESS you use/have cards for that)

Now to the infuriating experience :
- Lock mechanics (Random lock in cards because of effect of cards/items that you can't counter-play at all)
- Cheating Death (50% Coin flip that something in that lane doesn't die because why the fuck not)
- More RNG bullshit (Bounty Hunter's jinada, ogre magi's multi cast, Tidehunter's Ravage,Homefield Advantage, etc)
- First player to play 1 high mana cost often win the game(Time of Triumph, Incarnation of Selemene etc)

This game needs a massive rework.
[b]Not worth the monetization model[/b].
Don't get me wrong, card games are P2W by nature (take MTG for instance) and you gotta pay for every card, but IRL Magic you get to keep the physical cards, where in digital CCGs those "cards" die if the game dies.
It's hard to explain, but that monetization model belongs to the real world. Not even MTG videogames do that s***.
It may have a very large movepool that includes support options like Stealth Rock, a gigantic HP stat, and a unique typing in PU, but Wigglytuff constantly finds itself outclassed by other defensive Normal- and Fairy-types such as Audino, Clefairy, and Granbull thanks to their better stats overall. This relegates it to being an offensive Stealth Rock user that can pressure Defog users with decent neutral coverage. However, Wigglytuff's middling defenses and mediocre firepower make using it difficult. Wigglytuff also has to compete against other offensive Stealth Rock setters such as Aggron and Aurorus thanks to their better stats, typings, abilities, and ability to actually pressure Defoggers such as Skuntank.

Play Plants versus zombies heroes instead
As much as I like dota 2 and wanted to like this card game i cannot recommend it in good faith. The entirety of the game except for a few rare exceptions involve forking over increasing amounts of money for new cards to stay relevant and have a chance at winning tournaments. The gameplay is very similar to Heartstone and Magic the Gathering so I would only recommend it to people who plan to spend lots of money and really commit to the game.
Even in a free to play game like hearthstone you can play for completely free and eventually get a good collection. In this game you £16 for 5 tickets and 10 card pack with a free month of dota plus, and that is all the content you get :)
Valve is a multi-billion dollar company that loves money first and foremost.  Players are absolutely not the priority here.  Wrap you head around that fact before proceeding to read my scathing review.

Save yourself the headache.  Valve completely ruined a game that had tremendous potential.  I entered the game skeptical, I gave it every chance imaginable, I listened to all the people that defended the game in order to gain perspective, and ultimately I've concluded that this is one of the worst games on the market to date.

What makes it so bad compared to other horrendous games?  The wasted potential and blatant attempt to cash grab its players with no regard for the game itself.  This is a service to designed to make money.  It's not designed for player fulfillment.

It does almost everything wrong once you go deeper than the surface level animations and game concept.  The cards are unbalanced yet overpowered cards can never be nerfed due to the egregious economic model.  The poorly designed card pool leads to spikes of disappointment throughout the gameplay.  The market economy is so badly botched that this alone ruins the entire game and demolishes any hope of future potential being realized.

I've experienced gameplay bugs that caused me to lose a few games, and this isn't even considered a major problem to me because of the other glaring issues with the game.  You read that correctly:  Game breaking bugs that cause a player to lose a game that they had to pay a ticket to enter isn't even a top concern for me at this point.

The community is destroyed due to all the aforementioned issues.  If someone wants to make sound critiques, then they are perceived by many to be overly negative.  If someone compliments the game, then they are perceived by many to be delusional.  There is no way for a community like this to grow.  The fact is that the issues, at their core, stem from Valve's greed, which the player base cannot fix or control.

Throw this game in the trash can.  It is beyond repair.

What about Valve's reputation with other games?  Valve got lucky.  They managed to find a way to syphon money from their players in the other games without causing too much damage to the game itself.  Their attempt to syphon as much money as possible from would-be Artifact players has actually ruined the game at its core.

Artifact is such a blatant misuse of a good concept that I'm considering programming my own version of this game because of how much wasted potential there is.
Update after 27 hours at the end//

After seeing the game on streams and reading about it upfront, I really wanted to like it, but some parts of the game make it very hard to enjoy it longterm as it stands. Overall, my current review summary could be called "very mixed".

To start with the positive, the gameplay itself is fun and I could probably recommend that portion of the whole experience. It is more RNG driven than you might expect at first and you can and will lose (and win) games in the deciding moments to unfair RNG results, but that is not even the dealbreaker here. Nonetheless it should be mentioned, that I am lost from a design standpoint, why a fair share of cards exist that can make or break a game on a 50% chance. I would hope that in an upcoming expansion this is not further utilized as losing a 30min game to a random effect is a very upsetting experience.

Having said that, what really makes the game difficult to enjoy is simply the setup of game-modes. As described by many others, you can chose to play constructed and draft completely for free after buying the game. You will not have to pay tickets but also not receive any rewards. At first that sounded promising and I hoped to play the game that way and enjoy it. However, it simply does not work that way.

Playing the casual-draft, you will play against many people who are completely new to the game, new to the mode or simply are not invested into it and play along. If you played card-games before and are familiar with the draft concept, it will be very easy to achieve a high winrate here but it is a very awkward game experience. It becomes worse when looking at the casual-constructed mode, because people with starter decks will be playing against people who invested money and run fully-fledged decks. I am sure you can imagine how much fun that is. To top it all off, as there is no ladder and no ranking of any kind, people will concede games very easily in the casual mode, if the state of the board does not suit them.

To enjoy the full game experience you will have to turn to the expert mode. If you want to play the constructed mode here, you will have to buy packs or cards from the market and thus, invest money. Running a starter deck here is surely possible, but do not expect to win any games at all in that case. 
Further. any mode in the expert section costs a ticket to enter, which can only be acquired for hard cash or by trading in cards, which you had to pay for as well. 
To sum up my experience and to illustrate the issue: My last played draft was done in the expert mode, costing me a EUR 1 ticket, whereof you get 5 with the game purchase. I won two games in a row and then lost two in a row bringing me to a 50% winrate. The last game I lost to an RNG effect in the last round. My ticket was gone and with two wins I was one short to get a ticket back as price. I paid 1 EUR to play four games without any reward.

From my perspective, I had and would have fun playing the game on the level you can find in the expert section. However, I cannot see myself paying 1 EUR every time I want to play a round of 2-6 games. Sure, winning 4 games grants you one ticket and a pack as reward and 5 wins adds another pack, but the average player will not win that many games in significant amounts.

I think the game has great potential, but I would recommend to wait with a purchase until changes are made that allow playing the game in a competitive environment, ideally with a ranking system, but without having to constantly pay money only to -in simple words- keep playing the game.

Update after 27 hours:
After 27 hours I have to say that I will stick with the negative review. After playing it some more the whole game appears to be in a state far away from a finished product as the balancing of cards is completely off in several cases and the game design has flaws that are hard to understand (RNG on where a hero gets deployed round 1 can snowball into deciding the game and often the game is then decided in favor of whoever plays the first broken or at least game-deciding card).
 
On top of that the monetarization has not been thought through or the developer actually expected people to happily and continuously pay money to play the game. Without putting further money into it and only playing the free-mode, it does not feel like having access to the whole game but moreso to a limited trial-version. 

To be honest, I feel quite tricked by the developer and find the approach more than questionable.
I want to describe the negatives that are not economy-related, as these are more serious and indicative of the quality of the actual gameplay component of the title.

Bad deckbuilding - There is no synergy between cards, limiting viable strategies. 
Significant RNG - You can effectively lose a match before playing a card if you are unlucky enough.
Unsatisfying combat - Nothing has weight. Killing enemy heroes or minions is hollow, it doesn't sound, look, or feel important.

I hate to say this, because I was actually having fun with this game. I bought it on stream, played it on stream, and refunded it on stream. It's absolute nonsense that you have to buy the game and then buy each and every single item in it with no way to earn them beyond spending money to win 4-5 games in a row. There's a lot of potential here, but the fact that A: it has the audacity to charge you $20 for permission to spend more money on it, and B: ABSOLUTELY does not make that clear at any point until you go to build a deck, means it's an absolute money grubbing travesty. This is the first game I have ever refunded on Steam, and I will do everything in my admittedly limited ability to ensure no one else spends money on it either. This kind of business model can only be avoided by showing the developer in no uncertain terms that this is not how we are willing to spend our money.
Honestly i invested some + moneyz to the game after its launch ( which  i earned from dota 2 item sell :P ).
Game seems lacking some more of stategy in allowing you to pick lane of first hero spawn and place they land.
Model of game pay2win is 85% true -> you will also need some luck ( not much of it though ).

What hurts me most is lack of possibility to get new cards not paying for them -> like winning tournaments or game events.

If they charge for game from start then why they block the way to get new cards if not for money.
I would understand it if there will be physical realese of game and you would be able to get cards you own digital in physical form, else its just treachery and gay bank heist.
buy the gane --> buy cards --->pay to  pay---> pay to win 
change this sh*t so people can enjoy this game 
i think 17,95 € more than enough for cards game its realy fun to play 
but i dont recommend this game cuz we still have to buy some sh*t in game as well as we still wanna play it.
I am sad to write this review because the game has great mechanics and a lot of depth. The one thing that makes all of this irrevelant is the greedy business model. Without any way to earn free cards or packs it is simply a credit card game if you want to build your own deck.

Also I have noticed that 50% of my games see the enemy leave before the game has begun simply because they don't like the heros I have. Without any progression model or free way to earn cards players have zero incentive to actually finish the game. Valve have made a serious misstep with the business model and I urge them to make major changes and fasst because the game is already at risk of failing. I am simply not having fun being smashed by players who happen to have the money to buy Axe  or Drow.

I am very sad because I was excited to play this game but now it just leaves me feeling hollow.
Actually insane how much pay to win this game is. I tried playing the expert play mode and played against someone who just copy pasted a deck from idk where and just paid for all missing cards. It is literally unplayable because u cant even get any cards for free except for beating 4 pay to win players in a row which is pretty much impossible and then u will just recieve another trial for expert mode. There is not even a weekly card pack for free or something. So if u get shit cards at the start u need to pay extra money to get better or ber really lucky. I reall regret buying it save ur 20$ and get a different game or somthing different with it. 1.5/10
Is this some sort of pay to win? You pay for the game, and have to pay for the packs, and by the way, they cost $2 each, no matter how many you are buying. 1 pack? $2! 10 packs? No problem, $20! 100 packs? $200! Your soul for 1000 packs? It costs an aditional $2000
For 20$ you get: opportunity to play the game, to buy cards and tickets for events. That's it. You get no cards whatsoever. I don't care much about the fact that the only way to get cards is to buy them, but the fact that you get nothing for 20$ is ridiculous. GG, Valve, hope these 20$ made you happy.
The game was fun, great potential for this one... but the fact that there is no way to obtain cards other than buying packs or using the store to purchase seperate cards when I've ALREADY spent 20€ on the base game is ridiculous. This is total P2W and it's not even F2P. 

I highly recommend it if you got too much money to spend because it's fun. But i will be playing MTG:A

Just give us another masterwork of a singleplayer game without in-app purchases pls.
Don't waste your money. You won't get it back even within the return window. Steam/Valve apparently likes to insert starting items which automatically applies the "you opened this" nonsense even if you don't actually open anything. I made a point to escape out of opening the starting packs, and yet somehow something else still opened.
Unfortunately the game is unbalanced and has too much RNG to be enjoyable for me. Attacking in general is all RNG, sometimes a creep (spawn RNG) will spawn in a lane and soak up a dozen damage due to attack arrow RNG. Two turns in a row of a tower missing 6,7 or 8 damage from a hero feels like a very weighted RNG moment.  Heros aren't balanced either, with some being just completely better than others. No nerfs incoming due to valves policy about nerfs at the moment.

Initiative (going first) was actually a really cool idea at first. The idea of passing a lane early, possibly at a disadvantage, to go first in the next lane would be really cool if there werent a plethora of cards that gain initiative just by playing them. Meaning you lost value on a lane or two prior just to be "outplayed" because your opponent was lucky enough to draw a card like this. 

Overall, too many feelbad moments in this game for me to sink any more money or time into.
The monitization of this game is not an issue in any manner.  $1 phantom drafts that can easily go infinite is not a bank busting business model.  This games issues is varience...

I came to artifact with a fairly vast historical experience from MTG and MTGO.  As they are also Garfield games they give a good starting point for reviewing this game.  This has potential to actually be a good game.  A very good Game.

The problem is there is just way too much pure randomness spread throughout the game.  The issue with Artifact is there is absolutely no way to minimize the various.  I'm not talking about variance that comes with card games naturally.  The variance from drawing a card is part of any card game, minimizing that variance is part of what makes games like MTGO great.  

In Artifact the issue lies with the other amounts of pure randomness you can't play around in any manner.  If you play a hero (and/or the random creeps spawn) in a lane you have no control over where they enter the lane.  To be honest I actually like this feature of the game and think that, like the variance in drawing cards, this you can play around and skill will shine through.  

The problem is once a creature is in lane, there is a %50 chance that any creature will not attack the target it is supposed to (%50 straight ahead and %25 to either side).  This prevents any skill involved with playing creatures as their attack target is literally not what you planned for %50 of the time.  There are MULTIPLE cards that rely on pure chance to be active as well, things like %50 to survive instead of die, %25 to have a card return to your hand instead of discard when played, %50 to stun enemy creatures, the list goes on. and on. and on.  Like any high variance game you remember the bad beats more that the surprise wins so you always walk away feeling cheated.  

The end effect is the game becomes who can get the most creatures on the board the fastest and then get luck with attacks to buy the good item and become unstoppable.  

Again with some minor changes to remove the variance of cards already in play this can be a VERY good game.  At this time it's just a coin flip.  That always feels like it comes up not in your favor. 

MTGO had a few of the same issues with it's early sets, I just find it hard to believe that R. Garfield forgot the lessons learned with them...
Comment dated 28-Dec-2018.

This is my first time writing a review for a game.
Artifact is a card game like the card collection game in the real life except it is digitalized.
At the moment when i wrote this comment, I gave a "not recommend" for this game.

This card game is not balanced at the moment. The designers are not yet finalize the cards cost vs cards advantage. Quite alot of cards are poorly designed with no meaning for it to be in a deck at the moment.

If any players want to play this game and win, he or she will need to buy cards. Got money, please buy the blues cards such as Annihilation and At all cost, Conflagration which are All blue OP Cards (they are not cheap and all are expensive cards). 

The first few rounds are not able to win; the blue deck or semi blue deck will drag using those 3 sets of cards with a Ogre Magi and his Ignite total 9 cards which is damned high ratio to get. then the blue deck will win after mana cost reached like 7-9; you can use Annihilation in a group of opponent's lane with just a single blue hero and win the game easily in the middle game. Just don't need to be afraid to lose any blue hero; and in case and if possible, need to lose 1 hero each round so that every round you can play a hero card in an advantage lane to win; and play Annihilation or At Any Cost if needed.

I do not recommend the game to player who don't have budget to spent. It is very disheartening to lose most of the time.
That is why Artifact lose more than half of the players in the first one week of the launch!!
I am not proud with that purchase. I am paying for internet, electricity, heating and for so much more things and for sure I will not pay more for this game. I understand that "EXPERTS" or so called "PRO" will get the full exp of the game and it will be fun, but not for me. It's disappointing. it's not funny. No recommending and advising to avoid in any costs ( what a paradox)! It's not worthy.
TLDR; Game itself is alright, core gameplay is solid, found that my collection was more appealing as Steam credit for new games than something I couldn't be bothered to play more than once every few days at this point. With more expansions, and features that bring it out of feeling like an Early Access title, it could be worth people's time but at the point it's mostly a disappointment.

///

For those that don't already know, Artifact doesn't have the most stellar reputation at the moment. "Deadgaem" and P2P2P2P memes infest the subreddit when the mods aren't shutting them down and the playerbase has seen a drastic decline since launch.

Hyped to an extreme after several months of no information after it was revealed and boasting the credentials of MTG creator Richard Garfield on the design team, Artifact was sent out to the community at large with very high expectations. Indeed, the year long beta had big names from the biggest digital card games lauding the intricate and complicated gameplay, the silky smooth visuals and the feeling that this isn't just another children's card game and a contender for the highest level of strategic esports, some of which were so captivated by the gameplay that they moved away from the gaming scene where they first made their names. Sadly, a client that feels like it's barely out of beta and a slew of balance issues that were raised by those very testers were left untouched and the game was released into the wild feeling more like an early access title than the long awaited triumphant return of a legendary publisher. Furthermore, the market itself while reasonable by traditional paper TCG standards is still egregious from the standards of modern video games. In 2018 if any game gated entire powerful gameplay options behind $10-15 a pop DLC paywalls, there would be rioting, but this is a digital "trading" card game after all and, well it's cheaper than paper Magic (and arguably other F2P models if you're already willing to drop cash on the product). I fell prey to this thinking myself in the first while as I bought myself a few decks that I wanted to play and realized, after some time, that I could literally buy entire new fantastic games for the same cost as a few cards.

The gameplay itself, after nearly 80 hours of playtime, is alright. The core game itself is solid, taking ideas from HS and Gwent and refining them further while injecting the flavor and lore of DOTA2, a 3 board system that has an interesting way of handling how you use cards all wrapped up in an antiquated (if reasonable by TCG standards) economy. F2P it is not and while that's certainly good (to a degree) from the standpoint of a customer who's already expecting to drop a few hundred dollars, for the casual audience the reality of needing to pay for tickets everytime you want to play in an Expert or Keeper draft wasn't ideal and the fact that you were stuck with just how lucky you got when opening your first 10 packs, and how well you did with the tickets, greatly limits what you can do in constructed isn't a recipe for runaway success, and the low playercount at the time of this review represents that.

All in all the game is alright if you enjoy draft but expect to pay the equivalent of a AAA title if you're looking to build any competitive deck outside of the pauper scene and that, for me, is what really ended up encouraging me to sell my collection and uninstall in the end. After the time I spent I was barely logging on once every two days for a match and couldn't be bothered to finish any runs.
I love Hearthstone. It's perfect to play while I grind a skill on Runescape. It only requires so much attention and it is damn fun... 

This game though... It eats your attention. It demands you respond to the move of your opponent by making you each play one card after the other. It requires you to look turns ahead, not only on the board but at who has initiative.

There's some small balance issues but, for the most part, you can dodge those crazy strong units by moving into other lanes. There's some obnoxious spells, but other than cheating death, none of them have made me want to rip my hair out. Whenever I lose, it's close. Whenever I win, it feels earned.

I haven't been this sucked into a strategy game since I started Blood Bowl four years ago. Now, I'm playing Artifact with my buddy who got me into Blood Bowl and we're once again talking strats and trash talking over discord.

I hope this game takes off. The monetization model sucks if you're not willing to spend. I've dropped $20 after the purchase into the game and have not only a few decent decks but 17 hours under my belt. That's not a terrible deal and I have a feeling it'll be another 40 hours until I want to drop another few dollars on that next dope card or deck.

I hope they add some kind of reward system, only because I want the population to stay high and I want the game to thrive. The gameplay is so damn good, it certainly deserves that.

Valve is smart. I believe they'll come around. Even if you can just earn event tickets or something.

Edit: I have gotten my money's worth. I love this game. I will be turning this review to a negative until it is revived. It's dead. Don't purchase it unless you are just DYING to try the gameplay. Great game. Bad marketing, social features, and no playerbase.
dgsht predatory buisness model

can't even try the game vs friend without opening your starting item
no trade allowed out of the steam market (daddy gaben need a new yatch kiddo)
no way of getting card for your collection while being a f2p player

did i mention this is game as the worst RNG out of all TCG i played?
Total garbage. At least I got my money back selling the cards which is nearly impossible now, since 99% of cards are worthless and they don't give you 10 packs for buying anymore, only 5. (I know, I know, you can get packs by playing. But keep in mind this game had 60k people at launch and now it has 600. Don't expect to be paired against noobs and get ez wins with no effort because that doesnt happen anymore. For all of you saying the game is not pay2win and it's cheaper to build a deck than Hearthstone, you're just fanboys.... I've been playing Hearthstone for a year now and I have several competitive decks, and I only bought the welcome pack, which is the cheaper. The only thing Artifact does better than Hearthstone (and basically every other card game) is that all cards you get are marketable and tradable. It's an interesting game, but Valve is greedy af. This should be free2play. Don't buy it, you will regret.
Kept freezing and I lost my tickets because I couldn't even play because of the freezing issue. It runs fine now after it updated, but its a bit too late for my tickets and it costs money to buy more.
I dont know who wrote the bogus review about Valve still being in touch with their gamers, but this is just a money hungry card game or is it just me? Atleast give me a way to sell my cards in game to buy other cards besides having to put it on the market. How are you supposed to progress with your own cards when you get a bunch of average starting cards? I know luck of the draw and all that but come on give me a reason to grind atleast. I'd rather play Magic Duels.
The game is good, the mechanics are good, the only big and huge problem is that if you want to have new cards you cannot do anything else but to pay (as of now), even when you've already payed for the entire game, there is no weekly drops, there is no way on getting cards other than paying (or trading with some luck).

Also the game is heavily rng based, much more than heartstone.

If you are gonna buy it, keep in mind that you are not paying for a game, you are paying for 10 packs and 2 decks, cause if you were paying for the game you could at least get something from it.
Legit just bought the game, played for 4 hours got rekt by everyone that bought 500 packs, then sold all my cards to get my money back and now i have 0 cards in the game :)
There is no point to play Constructed, since there is no RANKED LADDER for it, so there is no point to get full deck because all "pro play" is behind 1$ paywal to enter and play DRAFT. 

Why would I buy packs over tickets? And all I get from DRAFT besides packs which I don't need in first place is... more tickets! Cool, I can finnaly play the game for free if I'm good! 

So all cool stuff is actually behind CUSTOM games and tournaments, which is not user friendly, considering price and other 1$ locked game modes. 

In games like this there should be global ladder for construncted at least. I see no fun finding good custom games, I just want to play. I don't want to test my RNG luck in DRAFT for 1$ since that's only place in game with people who care about winning but still locked by silly MMR.
In short: The Design, Gameplay and Dota feeling is great. But there is no reason to play the game without paying additional money into it! Unless you don’t care about getting any kind of rewards.
While Artifact isn’t free to play like all the competitors.

Cons:
•	Without paying money you can kind of only play casual Draft which will give you not even a reward if you finish it 5 0.
•	Constructed makes no sense because it’s Pay to Win.
•	No motivations to play since you get no rewards without paying money.
•	No ranking/ladder.
•	Playing competitive will cost you event tickets.
•	So without spending more money you are very limited.
•	When you pay for tickets, the fact that you play with your money does not make fun.
•	No daily tournaments
•	No ingame spectator mode for your friends.
•	It would also be nice to create decks together ingame with your friends.

I personally don’t like it when matches go on for so long and then you maybe lose it because of some randomness. Obviously Draft matches are longer then constructed. But without paying money for new cards to get a competitive deck constructed is no fun.

There are maybe too much random factors of which some can instantly lose you the match when both players are equally good. The random factors for competitive player are a bit too much still for the overall player it is fine and still much better compared to other card games.

It’s not only Pay to Win in constructed but also Pay to Play in competitive.

You need to consider that you also get 5 Entry tickets and 10 packages. The 10 packages are not worth much. With the 5 entry tickets for competitive you could get some rewards and keep on playing there but only if you’re a good player. Since the Streamers and so on already played the beta they are obviously much more experienced and I wonder if there is a matchmaking since there is no ladder.

Don’t get me wrong without the cons Artifact would be a great game. 
(Personally it might not be as competitive as the old Gwent could have been but that is no option now anyways)

They did a very good job on creating a different card game and the list of pros is much longer since they did a lot of good decisions.
Not only the design and the sound but most important the gameplay feels wonderful!

If you can live with the cons you should get it.

At the moment there is the call to arms event on which you can try out 6 different preset decks playing against each other, also without rewards.
[h1]tl;dr[/h1] Gameplay is good but the monetization makes the game bad.

This game is amazing, strategic and fun, easily the best card game I have played, and it's so sad that it is ruined with it's monetization. I know that card games are usually pretty expensive, but normally there is still a way to get cards without using money for them. The community market makes this a bit cheaper than other card games or atleast you don't have to buy lootboxes to get a random chance for a card you need.

[h1]GAME MODES[/h1]

Tickets are used for expert play where you have 3 options,
[h1]Constructed[/h1] Where you play with a deck you made out of your collection. Costs 1 ticket to enter.
[h1]Phantom draft[/h1] You choose 60 cards from the random cards presented to you and creat a deck which you can't edit between matches. Costs 1 ticket to enter.
Both of these modes you get prices: 3 wins = 1 ticket, 4 wins = 1 ticket + card pack, 5 wins = 1 ticket + 2 packs.
You can keep playing until you have won 5 times or lost 2 times.

[h1]Keepers draft[/h1] Same as Phantom draft but you can edit your deck between matches and you get to keep cards you drafted. Cost 2 tickets and 5 cards.
Prices: 3 wins = 2 tickets + card pack, 4 wins = 2 tickets + 2 card packs, 5 wins = 2 tickets and 3 card packs.

These game modes except keepers draft are in casual play, no need for tickets but you get no rewards.

[h1]MONETIZATION >:O
THERE IS NO WAY TO EARN FREE PACKS!!![/h1]

[h1]18€ initial payment[/h1]
10 card packs, which are worth maybe 5€ in the market if you are lucky.
2 starter decks, which are absolutely horrible.
5 tickets, which you can use to get infinite amounts of card packs if you are a godlike player and the rng is in your side.

[h1]Card packs and tickets[/h1]
Card pack costs 1,75€ and contains 12 cards with atleast 1 rare.
Tickets are sold in stacks of 5 and cost 4,5€ per stack.

[h1]Community market[/h1]
Most of the cards cost less than 1€, there is a lot of cards with price tag less than 0,1€ but some cards are very expensive in the market, when I last checked 25 more pricey cards cost around 75€. Remember that you can have 3 times the same card in your deck so every time you see a price in the market you need to triple it. (Except hero cards you can only have 1).
Card packs are sold 1,75€ per piece and contain 12 random cards where atleast 1 is rare.

[h1]GAMEPLAY[/h1]

[h1]Decks[/h1]
Decks are constructed with
5 different heroes.
X amount off spells, X amount of creeps and X amount of improvements (usually equals to 40 cards).
X amount of items.

[h1]Colours[/h1]
4 colours: red, green, blue and black.
You can only play cards with the same colour as your hero in the lane.

[h1]Basics[/h1]
There are 3 lanes which each have a tower with 40hp for both players. When tower dies it reveals the ancient which has 80hp. Towers have mana pool starting from 3 and rising 1 per round. Mana is used to play cards.

[h1]Start of the game[/h1] At the start 3 heroes are dropped 1 for each lane for both players. Also 3 creeps drop randomly in the lanes for both sides. In next 2 rounds you get to choose a lane for your last 2 heroes.

[h1]Gold[/h1] You get 1 gold for creep kill and 5 gold for hero kill. Gold is used for items in shopping phase after each round.

[h1]Rounds[/h1] Each lane is played separately from each others. When both players have ended their turns heroes and creeps will smack whatever target they are aiming for and the game will move to the next lane. After 3 lanes have been played the round ends.

[h1]Items[/h1] Items are used to upgrade the stats of your heroes (health , dmg and armor) and can give usable skills that cost no mana. In shopping phase you can also buy consumables (health potions, free random spell and free random item)

[h1]Heroes[/h1] Heroes have special signature cards that are added to the deck, they also might have a passive or usable skill. When a hero dies it spawns back to a lane you can choose after 1 round.

[h1]Ending[/h1] You win by destroying 2 towers or a tower and the ancient.
Can't earn cards by playing, you need to dual wield your parents credit cards to keep up with the meta.
Can't refund the game after claiming the 10 booster packs offered after the tutorial.

Money grabbing game - LITERALLY pay to win.
Played first ticket gauntlet, had two good games, won them both. Next round I go against a £100+ deck. Got crushed by OP cards and items like axe and blink dagger. Also played against the RNG wonders of cheating death.

Cheating Death: 50% chance of Anything in lane not dying in the lane! Completely broken and shit game mechanic. Who honestly thought this was a fun and skilfull game mechanic?

Only buy if you want to spend $$$ and feed Gaben more pies.
I played through the tutorial and enjoyed this game a lot. However I recieved no cards for my 20 dollar purchase no starter decks no packs and there is no way to report this other then to request a refund. Its a shame I would have really liked to play this game but with a critical flaw like players not getting the things they purchased I cannot support this game. steam really dragged richard garfields name through the mud.
Honestly don't think I could be more disappointed in a Valve title. 

All the hype, the only giving it to a select group to test before release. Numerous of features missing. The cost of the game on top of the cards, which are only dropping constantly reminds you the game is built on a $y$tem. 

Really don't see me playing this much more without some sort of major update.
EDIT: 

Artifact is moving in the right direction, but it needs to move a lot farther to warrant a positive review. The gameplay is great if you're looking for deep strategy, but the game unfortunately is still bogged down by it's archaic pricing model.

Literally a few hours after I wrote this, they put out an update LOL. This update gives you 
1. 10 free packs per season
2. A change to their balancing philosophy to not care about the market when balancing cards. They've already nerfed the most powerful cards and my favorite, *buffed* some weak cards! This is a huge point in favor of Valve.
3. They added ranked progression, TBD on how this will affect the game.

If the prices over time become reasonable because of change #1, I'll update this review, HOWEVER, compared to *PC Games* (not other TCGs) their pricing model is still predatory. I'd gladly drop $40 bucks per expansion for a full collection but paying >=$160 for a full collection is ridiculous. (FYI I think Hearthstone is just as bad so chill).

Original Review:

Artifact is a good game with a terrible pricing model that drags it down.
The pricing model even makes each match worse because the developers don't want to "crash the market" by actually balancing cards. 

People would say it's the cheapest TCG and that might be true, but all TCGs are predatory. It's like consoling you by saying this is the least hungry lion when you're trapped in it's cage. Compared to a regular PC game, this pricing model is basically a joke, especially given that non-card PC games are *more* expensive than this game to make and maintain! Imagine paying a dollar for every 5 ranked matches of Dota 2.

The only way you're going to enjoy this game is if you're a Magic player that wants to play a good digital TCG for cheaper. This is only because you're already used to getting gouged for your money.
Interresting???
the pacing is weird and nonsensical. I like card games but this one I really did not have any love for.
3 lanes is.. weird? I can see where the challenge would be but... the cards and effects around this are weird and it just isn't an enjoyable game for me. I would recommend to stay off from purchasing that game.
by the way I write this review durring the event where we were allowed free play. I will not buy this game later. this game has very rough edges andreally, really needed more time in the oven.

--update : it's still in my inventory. I never bought it. whyyyyy valve whyyyyy I can't even remove it
They writed a warning with tiny font "If you claim the card packs you can not refund"
I couldn't see it.
Now I have a game which I didn't like it.
Take your cards back, I don't want to play this game!
Got this game for free. Probably would have paid for it if I hadn't. Glad I didn't in hindsight.

I've enjoyed the times I played it, but never felt motivated to come back. The few times I returned were because I was trying to make an active effort to give it a fair chance.

Unlike Hearthstone, I also didn't ever feel the urge to play "just one more game". This is mostly due to the fact that it is a much more complex game, and therefore each game is on average more taxxing to play than its more casual competitors. As great as it feels pulling off some creative tactics that bamboozle your opponents, it feels equally as crummy when it happens against you. This is mostly due to the amount of things to keep track of, and unless you have the patience to think through every possible outcome, you'll probably not have a great time.

Here's a timeline of my experiences with the game:
1. I started it up, and immediately wasn't sure if I should open packs or save them for keepers drafts.
2. Decided to play a bunch of the premade deck events instead. (over the holidays)
3. Was too busy to play for about a month.
4. Came back, and the playerbase had essentially died.
5. Haven't opened it since, and my packs are still sitting there uncracked.

If it weren't for the fact that this game seems like a sinking, if not already sunk, ship at this point, I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys a game where you have the potential to make some really creative plays, yet has the patience to analyze and find the ideal move (not me). A game like this requires a strong community however, and at this point it seems like a lost cause.
The game at its core is fun but it needs a lot of work. I play card games casually to spend time and have fun but one artifact game is like 40 min and takes full focus from me so I cant play while doing something else which is not I find is not ideal for a card game. the must be a better rank system than this, its not satisfying nor rewarding and its not for free so its feels very bad to loose and not that good when I win. the cards and game play can be refined too. 

I really hope big changes come soon. looking forward to change my review soon :)
(First Impressions)

This is the first time I have experienced buyer's remorse w/ a game on Steam. 

I paid $20 entry price for a game which is worse than Hearthstone and Gwent (both are free and a load of fun), and which expects me to pay a ton more just to make it playable. Worst of all, the game isn't even fun or enjoyable. Very random, extremely boring matches, games taking like.. 5x as long as Gwent or Hearthstone. Much less enjoyment for time spent.

If the game was free I could have at least tried it out, decided it wasn't good, and uninstalled, but now I have lost 20 bucks and can't even refund after 30 minutes of playtime because of their parlor trick making you agree not to refund if you want to actually try playing. 

I am going to give this game a little time to see if I can get some fun out of it but I am doubtful at the moment.
Cannot recommend this game. Fun game, great new mechanics to a stale genre, but microtransactions are the ONLY form of collecting more cards. Your playtime amounts to nothing. Not only do you have to pay 19.99 to access the game, but you will have to dump your wallet into their palms once more if you wish for event tickets or packs. Cannot recommend until this is changed.
Right now, this game is just a cash grab. You cannot get any free packs outside the initial 10 packs (and the potential packs you can get from the 5 tickets). This game literally makes you pay 20$ to pay again. Their model is so bad that its EA level shit. Even if the game is free, this model is still shit. bad move valve, bad move
WARNING YOU CANT GET A REFUND IF YOU OPEN UP CARD PACKS!!!! 

 - NO refund because i opened up card packs.
- when deckbuilding you are forced to have your heroes signature cards in that deck. 
- ON DAY 1: I Opened 20USD worth of packs (10x) and got 6.88USD worth of cards on the current market value. This type of EV Value is already an indicator of a dying tcg game.
- Game creates to0 many Analysis paralysis momments in just 1 round. 2 EXAMPLEs: Creeps spawn in randomly which force you to redo the math/resources counting each round. Your oponent plays a card and  destroys your creature, so that green card you were hoping to play cant be played so now you have to rethink on the fly an calulate the math.
- colored cards can only be played if you have a hero of that color in that lane, but if your opponent goes first and wipes it out.... your hand becomes locked form playing same colored cards. This creates OP moments that can lock you out in a turn if you randomly draw same colored cards. and you got no way to *&^%$@@# help yourself
- not f2p friendly
- META is straight trash, it is down to 2 decks and essiantly you are goldfishing with little interaction.
- market prices have crashed, EV value of  1 pack is atrocious.
I also want me money back as many here . I paid for cards almost 300 euros and its the most stupid thing i ve ever did .
You let the game die and the economy die as well / All prices are gone 95% down so my 300 euros now worth 30 euros !!!!
Adding in all this no update for 2 months , all major tournaments and ladders are postponed with no announcements until they see what Valve will do with the game ! Speculations say that Valve may invest to Dota auto chess and abandon Artifact !

And what will you do for us that we supported the game by day 1 ? That we played more than 800 hours to this game ? I even gifted the game to a friend to play together and he stopped playing a month ago ! What will you do for us ? Anyone even read this comments ? I feel i was robbed ! 

No recommendation for the game ! Dont buy it ! 2 months of silence by Valve is too much ! Nowadays games launch with an update schedule for the year coming so that you ll now what is coming ! 

This case is similar to Paragon from Epic games when Epic announced that  they ll take down the game servers of Paragon to invest in Fortnite instead ! And I dont blame them they went for the big money :) 

At least make an announcement !
Wanted to refund this game, but since I opened the "FREE" packs you got with it, you're then NOT eligible for a refund. Thanks for abusing your own system Valve, you money hoarding greedy bastards. The Valve of old days are truly dead.
They just released unfinished game. 
Mechanics are great, graphics and gameplay overall seems very good, but Im still missing literally any motivation to start the game... you can pick one of these reasons why motivation to play is missing (and not only for me, if you see other reviews):
NO rank system,
NO quests,
NO chance for new players to get packs (you need to train with good cards to get better in the game so you can win some packs, but you need to buy good cards to train with them - great system :-),
NO phantom draft with friends
NO proper friend list in game (you just get redirected to steam app)
As much as I enjoy the game I don't reccomend it. Sure, its fun and a unique spin on the card game genre, but I can't reccomend it.
Pros
- Unique
- Fun gameplay
- New/Interesting game mechanics

Cons
- Horrible payment system
- Pay to play and pay to stay relevant as the meta changes
- Uninspired "1 ups" (a card will be just a better version of another, with no changes except just higher numbers or lower cost)
- Credit Card > Skill
- Very little come back mechanisms (throughout all colors)
- Bad tutorial
- "Golden Boner" Guides that yell at you
- Pay to play competitive mode


Also as someone who has played many irl card games, this just doesn't come close to feeling fair. I've played Pokemon TCG, MTG, Yugioh, and Keyforge. All those games have/had great balance (with the exceptions of very unfair meta, in which new sets made fair) and this doesn't feel the same. I understand a new set may fix this, but until that comes out, and  if you have to pay money for it, I can't take this part out.

Also matchmaking is supposedly based on skill (doubt it), when it should not only be by skill, but money spent. Braindead kid with $100 is better than a big brain who's broke
Tons of potential, bad execution. 

I got lucky I got a few Axes to let me get at least a semi decent deck.  Then realizing you always need to spend cash to make any progression, you are going to kill the game before you even start.  Needs to be at least one Daily progression quest that is free, otherwise what is the point of playing the game until a new set comes out? Servers will will just be full of hardcore wallet warriors that will just scare casuals off and result in empty que times.

Mechanically the game has WAYYYY too much RNG.  RNG to draw a card, RNG for creeps,(which doesn't bother me much), RNG for hero placement in a lane and RNG for who they are targeting. What kind of strategy can you legit make when you have a 12 damage hero with nobody in front of them, that decides to hit a creep next to him that is already going to die from the ally next to him?  So many games I have lost to heroes being idiots and just randomly deciding to not attack the tower, or when I place a hero in a lane, they always match up with a creep vs a hero they can one shot.  A cleanup of those mechanics to make some consistency would be nice.  Keep creeps random, 100% good.  Heroes let each player pick a field and then pick a spot.  Make everyone attack straight forward unless you play the tons of cards to redirect them.  

Really want to love the game, but there is lots of easy things to fix that will make it 100% better since the interface/animations are awesome.

On an added note: Cheating Death needs to be removed.  I had a game won after a long game.  I have luna and sniper in a lane with a 6 hp Omniknight and 2 hp Sorla Khan.  I opened up with Eclipse, 7 charges.  2 hits on omni, he lives.  5 hits on Sorla, she lives.  I cast tower barrage, they both live. Combat happens, THEY BOTH LIVED.  10 times in a row, cheating death activated and since I couldn't destroy the tower that was at 4 hp left I lost the game.  I wish I had this recorded.
Valve did address a lot of the problems with Artifact back in December, but the main issue remains that the game just isn't fun.  The game isn't balanced, it takes way too long to play one match, winning isn't satisfying, and there's more RNG than online poker.  The game just sucks.
The game had promise, but Valve overhyped, and severely under delivers in this game. The monotization really doesn't help in any way.

The game is beautiful. It feels good, looks good, sounds like dota. However, the matches are LOOONG. You could probably play 2 or 3 hearthstone matches by the time it takes to finish one match. This wouldn't have been an issue IF there was some klind of good reward system for making you waste all your time in one match. You play you heart out and in the end... nothing. Queu up again good lad, or buy some packs! That's it. Don't think you can try it out and refund either. As soon as you oopen the packs that come with your game, Valve will just say they won't refund because you opened in game items. SERIOUSLY? It's not like your keeping the packs anyways. Id rather go play Hearthstone again after this crappy experience.
Whole Valve fan base was asking for new games (L4D3, HL3 etc.) but NO.
Valve choose to release card game. Why? Because they saw how Hearthstone is successful with making $$$ with each new expansion and Valve was like: Hey!? They are earning so much money! We want it too! 

And that kids is how Valve created ARTIFACT.

• PROS:
+ GWENT: The Witcher Card Game (If you want to enjoy best premium cards ever & most free to play friendly game ever made) 

• CONS:
- Economy (Pay to Play)
- Unable to trade cards
- Cards are only sell-able (33-66% TAX cut for VALVE - ANOTHER VICTORY for Valve)
- In first screen you have to (or can) OPEN PACKS (If you did you can't refund game so another greedy move from Valve)
It's fun, but my friend spent money and instantly became god

Edit: Don't be fooled by their so called "Card Drops" being added to the game you only get 10 extra card packs and thats it, and even then you have to go through the level progression system to even get them. Personally I see a issue in the future for this game, don't get me wrong it's a fun and great game however we were given the free packs for purchasing but as soon as they drop the next line of cards im sure to say we aren't getting squat, so add actual drops plz valve.
I feel that Artifact is a fundamentally flawed game. The concept is nice. A card game utilizing Dota mechanics and lore to its fullest extent. However, while polished, the game is just too complex, unrewarding, and just downright unfun to play. 

The cards are boring. Because most of the cards/hero are boring/simple, many are just strictly better or worse than others. The gap between bad and good cards is staggering.

I did enjoy deckbuilding and experimenting with different builds though. 

I would rate this game with a 
2/5 for how fun it is
2/5 for the rewards and progression
and 
2/5 overall
100% pay to win...
This game will not reward you in any way for playing, the only way to get cards if through the steam store or real money
I enjoy playing this for now, but I regret buying it, I only play cause I feel bad for spending that money.
DO NOT BUY - they won't refund it, I have 112 minutes game time and played a few games, but because i started the game and opened the starter pack, my refund was rejected - dirty business practice. 

Why do I not recommend: It's not fun. Having played a huge amount of MTG and Hearthstone, this games core concepts really don't work well together, the very random elements overwhelm any fun to be had that card games depend on, the random targeting elements really hurt the game.

I don't like that I have to spend a base amount of money and then the game is full of microtransactions..  

Steer clear if you want to try.
Plays very slowly, 1 games can take 30 Minutes. Also there is a huge random factor, sometimes there are games u feel are unlosable and then you get terrible spawns and your opponent turns it around.

Also there is no free2play progression at all, no dailies, no mmr, no way to generate cards apart from the 10 starter packs. You ever have to pay 1,75€ per pack or buy a ticket for an event and then get something out of it. Unfortunately its impossible to make up for paying users by playing a lot.

Dont buy this game if you dont want to risk having to put some extra money into it. If you are a good player, you might be able kinda sustain yourself, through selling the cards you get from a payed event on the community market and then using that money to buy your next ticket. But definetly dont recommend this game for kids or panrents wanting to buy their kids a game
Wow, I just bought this game and didn't get 10 packs for the steep $20 game price. Turns out just 2 days ago they changed it from 10 packs to 5 packs for new players. There's no good reason to buy this game for new players. Not only did they nerf what you get for your purchase, the game is pretty dead. Not enough new players so new players will get matched with players with powerful decks.

It's also super RNG based. If you thought hearthstone back in the days of knife juggler and imp implosion was bad, this game is much worse. It's completely luck where your characters get placed and who they attack.
Magic Arena is better.

Artifact has too much RNG and there's no way to grind for free cards/packs like in Magic.

The game is fun but the business model is half-assed. No rewards whatsoever for the free modes, and even the best players can get royally fucked over in drafts and go 0-2 because of how much RNG is in the game.

I am glad already sell all my cards (incluede axe) before they loss their value.

pay to win? For me its pay to have a card
since you can beat everyone with cheap black hero deck
or everyone be unlucky to always face your red/black hero with their glass hero

this game available for not spending anymore player? yes u can play draft mode or play constructed deck from artifact even you doesn't have the cards.

you can't control unit (except with card effect) + unlimited board size + unlimited card in your hand + no restriction to use item on hero = Praise the control decks
yes, control deck everywhere . .
but remember you can defeat expensive deck with your starter deck
believe in the heart of the cards
I cannot recommend the game. It is riddled with RNG and I think it really suffers from poor design choices.

I did enjoy my time with it for the first few days where I was immersed in the game, learning the mechanics and just enjoying the polished visuals and sound design which I think are better than any other card game I have played.

However it didn't take long until the cracks started to appear. Almost every single thing that happens in the game has an underlying coin flip/dice roll that can decide an outcome. Creep spawns, hero deployment positions, random damage effects of cards like plague ward that could be the difference between upkeep-killing a hero or dealing 2 damage to a creep... Not to mention fundamentally poorly designed cards like Cheating Death whose existence alone proves that the game is just not very well thought-out.

All in all, I might come back to it if the game receives a complete overhaul to its core mechanics or at the very least an interesting expansion. The problem is with the way that the economy is designed, Valve has left themselves in a position where they can't really balance cards...

So really I don't know what can save this game from itself.
[h1]TLDR: IN MY OPINION DO NOT PAY MONEY TO PLAY THIS GAME, IT IS AN ONLINE CASINO.[/h1]

This game isn't just pay-to-play, it's pay-to-play-pay-to-win. While on the surface, the game plays fine, the way it's been set up is not only bad for players, but possibly opens Valve up to liability for running an illegal gambling operation.

First problem - There is too much randomness in the game. 

You do not have control over the exact placement of your heros, who are placed in random initial lanes, then in random positions in lanes you pick later. Creeps are placed randomly, and randomly direct their attacks. You have a choice of at least three 'shop item' cards between rounds, one completely randomly sellected, one randomly selected from your deck, and another randomly selected from 'basic' items. The amount of gold you get to spend on 'shop item' cards is in part determined by the random placement of creeps, and one player will always gain an early gold advantage due to this random placement. If you play draft, the draft selection is not a group pool, but a randomised selection of cards, which are apparently randomly narrowed down after your picks. You can only pick one hero per pack in draft, making the ability to balance your colours hugely dependant on chance.

Second problem - Even the smallest of prize rewards are hard to get.
The game apparently matches players of similar win histories, in order to get an expected even chance of winning the single game. Matches are all one-off games in a gauntlet, with elimination on your second loss. To win the smallest prize, a single play ticket, you have to win three games before being eliminated. (You pay one ticket for entry, so the smallest prize is basically a refund.) To win a pack, you need to win four games before being eliminated. However, because you're being matched to produce an expected 50/50 chance each game, this makes it significantly unlikely to win three games before you lose two. It is even more unlikely to win four games before losing two.

Third Problem - This appears to me to be an online casino.
Valve allow you to sell cards on their market place, in exchange for currency denominated value you can use in the Steam store. Let's stress this... Valve let you exchange the winnings from a game of chance for coupons for their store. [i]There may be legal issues with them doing this.[/i]

Because of these major and fundamental issues with Artifact, I strongly reccommend against paying any money for it.
"The game is fun. If it's not fun, why bother?"  
- Reggie Fils-Aime  
These words from Reggie ring true here. From legendary game designer Richard Garfield, Ph.D, comes Artifact. Another card game. I'm a *huuuuuuge* Magic: The Gathering fan, so I had some high hopes for this game. The monetization scheme really scared me, but unlimited "phantom drafts" seemed fun. Boy was I wrong. This game seems fun, but it's bogged down by a complicated ruleset and just waaaay too much randomness. Minion / hero placement really matters in this game. That alone isn't bad. But what frustrates me is that basic creeps are distributed to lanes randomly. Ok, whatever. Not too bad. But the randomness gets measurably worse when each minion determines its target randomly. I can count the times I've lost because of this. There are minions that can subvert this, but they're few and far between. The design in this game is stellar, and I don't think I'm mincing words when I say that. The game is certainly well-designed, but it's too complex for it's own good. There's just too much happening all the time. The game has charm, but when every game feels like a slow crawl, the charm wears off. Overall, the game has its merits, but with a dwindling playerbase, complicated rules, and slow gameplay, I'm going to say this isn't a fun game on the whole. It has it's moments, but those moments don't come often. The game isn't fun; so I have to ask: why bother?
There's way too more RNG then I expected. Initial units placement and attack arrows are often very frustrating. UI is a bit messy, and game performance is much worse then expected from a card game.
Most importantly, game charges a lot for anything related to ranked play, in addition to the 20 USD upfront cost.
Artifact comes of as greedy, lazy, and much less satisfying to play then I hoped for.

P.S. Phantom mode is fun if you don't mind paying 20 bucks just for all of it.
Played the game a bit and it wasn't for me so I tried to refund it. Turns out you can't refund the game since you "opened" some packs which you get when you log in and play the tutorial.

Nice move valve.
Needs a lot of improvements. No mulligans so you can get boned by a bad start more than most card games. Claims to be majorly skill based and yet arrow rng makes the hearthstone clown fiesta look skillful. Super shop rng as well. Cards like golden ticket shouldn't exist. Wouldn't actually mind the payment model if the game were actually good.  It has needless complexity and rng masquerading as depth.
I usually enjoy card games, and even mediocre ones have me stuck for a while before I figure them out and move on. Artifact however took me less than 10 hours before I was utterly bored with it. I've had absolutely zero desire to log back on and play. I think a lot of it has to do with the lack of progression and the random unit placements which just has such a huge impact on how the games play out. It's just not that fun playing a strategy game where you play a card and just have to hope that the units end up where you want them to. Would really recommend just playing Magic the Gathering Arena instead. Or even something like Hearthstone or Elder Scrolls Legends. Anything but this, basically.
The pay 2 win system ruin it all
One thing about valve that i liked is Valve never did that thing
They only makes cosmetic item and stuff but never make it to ruin the gaming system
And now with P2W system only a rich kid can get to a high level
3/10 and take a deep breath for a Valve Glory time
[b]EDIT for Build Your Legend Update on Dec 20, 2018:[/b] 

[b]ABSOLUTELY DO NOT BUY.[/b]

 While the new update does address some original issues I had like "lack of progress" by adding Weekly bonuses and Ratings which you can earn "free" tickets and cards, Valve also changed the number of packs and card new players get upon purchase!

If a new player was to purchase the game now, they receive [b]5 Card Packs, 2 Event Tickets, and 2 preconstruct starter decks. [/b] Players like me who had purchase prior the the update got 10 cards packs and 5 Event tickets. New players are getting screwed in a card game that needs more new players.

The game still needs a lot of work. Games can still take long periods of time, and while RNG is inherent to every card game, the RNG in Artifact feels less fun.


[b]Artifact is a Pay-to-Play digital card game in a space where established Free-to-Play card games like Hearthstone and MTG Arena exists.[/b]

To the people who want to argue that Valve made a card game where your cards are "worth" something. They are not worth anything. From a economic standpoint, it's a digital card game so there is no cost in production when creating card opened in pack (unlike in physical tabletop MTG cards). As people open more packs (either given for free or purchased), more cards will exist in the Marketplace and card value will inevitably trend downward.

As anyone who has played Hearthstone, MTG, or any card game, Valve will release new expansions and create new cards that will be more powerful or offer new mechanics that trump the old base cards. Initially Valve has maintained that to get cards you need to spend money to buy packs or buy the cards from the Marketplace. With the new update that allows players to get "free" packs as you rank up, it hard to figure out how Valve is going to proceed. Will players be able to get free packs from the inevitable new expansion or is it going to be a Pay-to-Win model?

[b]My original criticisms of the game still stands. Games take too long and still not fun to play. [/b]
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[b]Original Review[/b]

It's like playing DOTA 2 without any of the satisfaction of playing a game. I LOVE DOTA 2 despite the fact that games can take too long, the people I play with and against may be terrible human beings, and the game has a steep learning curve for a beginner. Why?

Because playing and learning to play DOTA 2 is FUN!

Artifact games take way too long (compared to other cards games), have too many random elements that are not fun to play with or against, and there is no progression system that incentivizes me to continue playing.

Winning or losing a game of Artifact is not fun.It's not necessarily a bad game, in fact, Artifact is a well produced game with high production values. But it is not fun.

These are fixable issues but the current iteration of Artifact makes the game very unenjoyable to play.
I think this game has alot of potential to be great, i wouldve refunded it but the tutorial itself takes about half an hour to complete and if you play 3 full matches you have already passed the refund time nice scamm you pulled, if i had known this game was just gonna be another RNG infested shit hole where the only way to  proggress through the game was to drop 500 dollars i wouldve never purchased it, i want my money back.
this game sucks.. first you have to pay for the game, then if you want to play competitive you have to pay too. you want better cards for random free play? guess what you have to pay...

compared to real tcg the market is controlled by valve.
you dont own the cards you buy with your money and if valve decides to change drop rates you valuable card has lost all value. people stop comparing it to RL TCG
The gameplay's fun, but the game's economy is pay-to-win, lootbox trash.  Hope you're ready to plop down another $60 if you ever want to play Constructed competitively.  Not to mention, there's no way to get any rewards or progression in the game for free.  Any mode that has a reward is pay-to-play.  Hope you enjoy paying $1 every time you wanna do Constructed or Phantom Draft with the chance of a reward.

Also, if you plan on using the Steam marketplace to get cards, prepare to get gouged.

Subtotal
1.97 USD
Artifact fee
0.73 USD
Steam transaction fee
0.73 USD (fees charged by Valve Corp.)

Total:
3.43 USD
I was very hyped for this game, and I knew it's hard to learn. But after playing it for around 10 hours, I just don't have any desire to launch it again. Artifact feels more like a chore than an entertainment.

Let's put RNG issues, lack of progression and ladder, game and card costs aside.

Is Artifact fun to play? NO. The game supposedly has a lot of decision making, but all those decisions boil down to reacting to what your opponent does. And there's usually only one best play (reaction) you can do. Sure, there are moments when you can decide between making a risky high-reward play and less risky play. But again, it all comes down to reacting, which, in turn, comes down to what cards you and your opponent have.
Artifact is a great game, I love it. Just as I love Dota 2, the way it plays and the strategies employed are amazing. It looks great, feels great, and is great overall. The way the marketplace and "Expert" gamemodes work is just flat awful. The only way to get new cards is to pay for them which is near on impossible for a poor college student. The game almost forces the people who dont have a lot of spare cash to sell their best cards. Some cards are worth a pretty penny but those are also game winning, soon as they are played "GG" cards. I wouldn't mind it that much if after I sold those great cards to get into expert mode I was instantly matched with a guy who is clearly paying to win, with say an axe, pa, sniper, lc, and some other black hero. Having an axe, pa, or sniper in your deck makes it near on impossible to lose and if your facing one or all threee of those your pratically screwed from the get go. So you end up wasting that expensive card, not to mention that just like hearthstone, contary to what the streamers say, there are places where the luck makes you lose. WHich again I wouldnt mind if I didnt lose my mone because this asshat drew every single card he needed in the order in which he needed it, while I drew jackshit. That wouldnt be such a problem if it didnt cost you money, yes hearthstone does that same thing but you dont have to spend money in hearthstone. So you just wasted your time, instead of wasting your money. 
1. I would not recommend buying this game till value puts in a way to earn packs or tickets without paying
2. expert mode matches you with oppenents based on the amount of money you spent on the game because it doesnt matter how good you are at a certain point after you win so many times youll hit a pay2win cieling
3. or something along those lines.
Issues With The Game.
The game is too complex for many players to follow, multiple lanes/boards, the shop, only being able to play cards if you have other cards in play first, understanding how to win a match.
The game has too much RNG that outright wins the game.
Matches last too long.
Matches are too complex for people watching from Twitch, Youtube, Steam
As of right now, the game cost too much money for someone looking to get into a card game considering how many other card games are out there.
The marketplace seems bad because Valve can make some very rare powerful cards that end up selling for $10, $50 to over $100s on the marketplace and will define decks.

So no i i wouldn't recommed it.
I would not recommend this game in it's current state. This is not because of the monetization issue like a lot current reviews, but because of the gameplay.

I was really excited for this game and  I have 6 perfect runs in casual and a few expert draft runs. The two main problems to me are game length and RNG
[list]
[*] Game length.
[/list]
The games in artifact are way too long unless you are playing mono red or red/black. I don't want every game to last 30+ min just because I want to play blue. Its also basically impossible to run out of time without them implementing the tournament timer into basic play. If someone's using all of their time I usually just end up misplaying a bunch because I'm so bored that I'm watching YouTube while they take their turns. Being bored and muttering [i] come on [/i] while I wait for my opponent isn't appealing to me. One of the larger problems I have with dota is the length of games from que to end, I want something faster from a card game.
[list]
[*] RNG.
[/list]
Richard Garfield talked in an interview about RNG and how it like it as long as its done correctly. Which in his words meaning the higher skill opponent will come out on top most times, and how there are tools to counter the rng in the game.

That applies less so to draft in my opinion than constructed, and I only enjoy draft. You don't have the access to the same tools to counter rng as you would in constructed. The amount of RNG in this game is just too high. You have creep deployment /creep placement /hero placement /attack arrows /item shop /card RNG (cheat death/ veno wards etc. ) on top of normal draw RNG. It feels like sh*t to get dumpstered in the opening deployment, or have some bullsh*t arrows during the game, regardless of if you win or lose. I (maybe most people) notice when they get screwed more than when they get lucky. 

I gave this game a good chance and I want to like it, but I just don't enjoy the game in its current form and would not recommend it.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tH2w6Oxx0kQ
Make no mistake, I love this game.  I love the complexity (it's not as hard as it looks to play once you learn the basics) and almost everything about it...

But in no good conscience can I recommend this game.  It is a money pit.  To consistently win in expert constructed you need the best cards, and to do that you need to pump a TON of money into card packs.  I have a beta key so I got 10 free packs, plus bought 20 more and got 2 x Axes so in essence I only paid for 10 packs once I sold the extra one.  I have never even seen some of the cards, and it is all but impossible to consistently get 3+ wins without certain cards.

On the topic of progression, there isn't any.  Not without doing the above (sinking tons of $$$ into packs) before you can even start to get 3+ wins and even then you might just be better off buying individual cards off the marketplace.

Again, I love this game, but the pricing model is an abomination of corporate greed, and like all of these ridiculous TCG/CCGs, it is a massive money sink - unfortunately, this one is the biggest of all.

If I want to have some fun randomly I might play normal draft (as it doesn't cost anything) but outside of that I'll be selling my Axe and Drow and taking my time and money elsewhere.  It saddens me to say that.
Common pay to win card game that is not worth buying. So if you like how Hearhstone ladders and rankings work out you probably like this one then.

Also if you open your starter booster packs the game isn't refundable. So keep this in mind.

Also there is no gold in this game you can only buy boosters or new cards with money. 

The game itself had potential and it had nice interface and graphical effects but it just wasn't enough. 

This game needs another mechanic for obtaining tickets and boosters than real money and only then you should consider playing it.
Nice gameplay but too long
It cost huge money to get all card and it does not have any reward like daily quest, win x game, etc
No money in game, Everything requires cash
You can't even refund this game. Don't buy this
Địt con mẹ game lừa đảo đắt vcl, bỏ 20 usd ra đéo được nổi 1 deck meta
Pay to access the game and then Pay to Win without even a way to grind out cards. The game itself is fine, but don't buy this game unless you want to spend additional money on it as Steam will not refund the game no matter what.
Cons
-There are too many overpowered cards.
-Each match takes anywhere from 30 minutes to 1 hour to play.
-The idea of buying virtual cards to play is stupid.
-The idea to play tickets to play is stupid.
-No Ranked play (however you can pay to play in competitive mode, what???)
-RNGx3 in a card game??? The creeps can spawn in any 3 lanes. The creeps can attack different directions. Lastly, cards have RNG components.

Pros
I have $10.17 left in my Steam Wallet from selling my cards.
It's really 50/50 for me but maybe a bit leaning towards negative. Considering how many great games there are today a 50% review is a bad one.
So core design is great. Very good towards Dota fans(who don't play CCG anyway=)) and very fresh. Game feels more like a grand strategy, that a quick tactical skirmish like most other CCG. Every loss leaves you with couple ideas why you may have lost and what to try next. Deck building doesn't feel like it takes exel spreadsheet to do. I have been doing pretty good with just a deck built from several tries and errors. The experienxe is finished, most game go toes to toes even if you are at disatvantage there is rarily every a "ragequit" moment when you realise that you have already lost but there is still 20 more mins for it to painfuly end. All in all core gameplay and its execution hit a bit hardcore or just smart players very well and first hours feel great.
But then you start to notice the little things. Where do I begin:
- There is something wrong with product placement and monetization. Clearly there is.
- No progression
- A person watching a TV show while playing can make you suffer. There are a few turns that require thinking every game, but mostly you stick to the plan.
- There are 10 heroes. Not 45. Maybe other players just don't have them, but I c Axe Legion every game. Poor fellas.
- No "feel" to victory. I am more happy when I win vs a bot in WC3, than winning a 5streak game here.
- Animations are irritating and frankly controls feel a bit off.
- Ohh boy in game market interface does not work
- UI and navigation could be better. (I am talking about a lot of cards in the hand and minions on the field. Just +1??? Come on you can do better)
- No point in owning any cards. Therefore no point in playing for packs.
- Comparing to other games drawing is very meriocre. Unity student project feel doesn't leave you.

To sum up: Feels like a beta. Clear focus was the gameplay, but there is no "hook" to it. Hardcore games feel good coz you learn and get rewarded for the effort. Great idea ruined by hasty release, lack of attention to details and UX and sloppy marketing. The reception would be lightyears from what it is now if Artifact was a payed early access alpha/beta.



The gameplay of Artifact is incredible, easily my favourite card game of all time - and I've played all of them. However, I cannot recommend this game to most people as everything else about the game is just bad.

First of all, the Constructed game mode (50% of the game) is easily more p2w than any other card game I've played. There are three ways to get cards in Artifact, and all three cost money. And if you decide to sell some cards to buy the ones you want, you'll have a 100-200% tax unless they're rare cards that sell for more than 1-2p. I'm not a fan of the Hearthstone model, but this model is far worse.

On top of the fact that there's no reward for playing the game (unless you pay for 'expert' mode), there's also absolutely no progression system, ladder, quests, or other content to promote replayability. So unless you're like me and you really love the gameplay, you'll probably get bored very quickly.

Not the mention the fact that the game is very unbalanced right now. There are 1-2 heroes of each colour that completely dominate, so get used to seeing Axe, Drow, LC and PA in constructed. A lot.
Perfect example of great concept with poor execution. Valve should listen more carefully to player's feedback instead of putting their heads in the ground pretending that their game is perfect.

Artifact's failure is the just punishment for their arrogance.
People say that Axe and Drow are the most OP cards. That is false. The credit card is the most OP card and you'll win if you use that card more often.

Jokes aside, Artifact is a great game in both presentation and gameplay. But as it stands right now, I can't recommend it because it is plagued by a greedy monetization scheme - yet I keep seeing people defending it. I can't remember the last time people were happy when they have to pay $180 to get a full game.
Another brilliantly designed game by Richard Garfield. The gameplay is complex yet simple, It does well to mix Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone yet having it's own distict strategy and feel. Imagine multiboxing in MTGO but you and your opponent share a single hand. There are a lot of ways to approach a game. Also sneaking in a win feels really satisfying like back dooring in a moba. Voice acting and sounds are really well done and the animations are smooth. Another plus is that you can spend money in the community market to buy the singles you need for a competitive deck without having to deal with the RNG of booster packs. This really makes this game feel more like a TCG then a CCG.

However, I cannot recommend you getting the game in it's current state. I believe the game has a few things holding it back from being a instant recommendations. These things could be fixed in time which is why, I wish steam has a a mixed review option. Valve has taken a beautifully designed game and nearly ruined it by it's aggressive montization and business model. The game in it's current state offer no progression to it's "f2p" players, after your first 10 packs and 5 event tickets, if you fail to make back event tickets or packs you have no way of expanding your collection except by buying packs or buying cards from the market. Casual drafting and "Casual" constructed does exist but there is NO REWARDS for playing either modes, there is no "quest" system or "reward" system in place for putting time into these modes. They are there for practice. Paid events while cheap do not offer good rewards for the time and effort put into them which while not a big problem, I personally do hope this is considered to be changed.


This game can be an easy recommendations if or when Valve decides to pull back on the montization and have a healthier and more friendly environment for f2p (after the $20) and budget players, as well as some time of progression/motivation system for players.
I like it but i fucking hate it at the same time, clearly a paid advantage for people who people who pay for more than just the game. should be free to play in my opinion
+ Good Game with good mechanics. 

- Pay2Progress (Pay2Win is normal for a CardGame - But Pay2Progress is a joke)

You HAVE TO  pay for the cards, there is no way to get cards by playing. An "good" deck cost around 30€ in the marktplace or u have to buy booster-packs for 1,70€.
If they add a mechanic to get free cards like in Heathstone, I will give a better feedback, couse the game is realy good.

Meanwhile I will play Hearthstone =)
I've played over 5000 hours of DotA and TF2 on multiple accounts and love what Valve puts out but this is the most scummy business scheme ive ever seen. Your excuses for its terrible business model are wrong. "Card games have been doing it for years" Not digital card games. People claim theres more value when you buy the game than Hearthstone, RIGHT NOW you can log in and claim free packs and a guranteed legendary. Do no support this terrible practice for an average badly RNG made game with no progression to make you feel like ever picking it up again, 90% of its playerbase is dead and it deserves to be. Put people back on the TF2 team and stop promoting trash like this. Dead game OMEGALUL
Re Tard Alert! Re Tard Alert!

I just don't understand the 50% off of the game after one week from the release. Let's wait and see the 90% off on christmas sales and no refund or any kind of reward for us who pay the full price.

I feel like I am fooled by valve.
Kudos for originality and not sticking with the same old MtG model a lot of these games clone., but the game felt too obtuse and random to have any real fun with. If you're big into deck building and pretty hardcore about the genre you might enjoy it, but to a casual tcg fan, there are much better options out there.
Don't buy this game. The architecture for this card game is pure retardation. You spend  CDN $27 to buy the game, you get 10 packs and 5 tickets. Seems sweet right?

Wrong, you will  soon learn that outside of those starting items, you have no way to get any cards outside of either paying for them/packs or winning gauntlet matches with the tickets given.

Don't even think you can refund this game after you open those initial packs, you can't refund the game if you open a single one. Is the base itself good? The answer is yes, however with the architecure of this game be prepared to lose if you don't own the more expensive/rare cards needed to gain an edge on your oppenent.

Which brings me to my next point, the rares are SIGNIFICANTLY better then the starting cards provided. I understand the rares have to be better then the starting cards/commons, but the differences is staggering.Why play keefe when Axe is an option? Axe has better stats + a better signature card. Why use lycan or Rix when Drow exists? Drow has a significantly better signiture card and ability compared to both of them.

As the game is right now, I can't recommend this game to anyone unless some major changes are made to the game's architecture.

I honestly beleive Valve can salvage this game if it goes free to play, and has a premium mode that allows for marketable card drops for players who have either bought this game at full price or wish to opt for premium.

TLDR: I can't recommend the game in it's current state
the game is hanging to dear life right now, the devs said that they'll be here for the long run. so there is a possibility that they'll revive it. but for now it doesn't have much going for it, if you're interested in it, wait until it's back on its feet to buy it.
The game is a money pool, you have to invest almost the triple of the cost of the game to get a decent competitive deck, nowhere was especified i would have to invest so much after i got it, i followed advices from internet on selling the cards i got and get new ones so i won't have to invest a lot on a decent deck and even so i keep finding that if i don't buy the more expensive cards i can't even be competitive making this game a pay to win game and to top it all there's no incentive in other gameplays to even try and play them and get more cards, so if i don't invest money i don't get cards and to get cards i need to invest money, this makes the game boring and not fun at all, because to play decently i need to pay even more, nowhere in the descriptions was especified something like this, that i should invest even more money to be able to enjoy the game at it's fullest, very disapointed in how this game ended, i don't want to play it anymore and i want my money back if i knew this would happen i would have never bought this crappy game.....
After 4 days of play I can already say this game is dead: no ladder, no fun game modes to play, matches are boring. I guess Artifact was made to spill a lot of money from people who believed it could be a great game, including me. Please devs do something about it.
The mechanics are really strong but as of release it just feels like a demo. Other than straight up buying new cards there is nothing to work towards, not even a ranked mode yet.
Imagine taking hearth stone, but then getting rid of ranked play, solo play, earning free cards for playing, and left you with just the micro transactions. That is artifact.
So. i played 28 minutes of this game . didnt even got to the point where it says if you open the packs you can't refound it. that 28 minutes (the first tutorial) was more than enough to convince me to refound. Artifact is what happens when you strip a game down to the point where it becomes a credit card reader with a mini game. and people will buy packs because they like to win. who cares if there is no progression,social, or grind system in place to make your collection bigger? They have a dedicated fanbase to milk. For a while.
Excuse me if im impolite but this is a returning occurrence with many game studios and it needs to stop.
if you dont want to pay more money on this game, please dont buy it. it takes more than half an hour to finish a game.why not play dota2 if i have so much time?moreover, you cant get new card unless you pay more money. it is impossible to win the master match, which is the only way to get new card without paying more.this game is a piece of shit
The game is good and nicely designed, but unfortunately it's for a narrow audience: people with time and money.

Forget about having this as a Trading Card Game (BTW, the game is wrongly tagged as TCG by Valve once that there is no trading). This is a hole new genre that I call CCG (Credit card game).

Artifact matches take around 40 minutes to complete and the game (will) require a constant flux of money in the order of $100 – $300 a Season to be competitive. Less will give you selective cards, so it can be possible to play with less but you wont have most of the cards.

This game is NOT for you if:

* you want a game for quick plays and casual fun. A match can take as along as a DOTA 2 match.
* you do not posses extra money to continuously spend on it.

In overall the game is good, but without putting money on it and only playing the free matches , there is no sense of accomplishment, there’s nothing at all, as if this was a game specially designed for competitions and pro-players.
Way to much RNG, feels like I'm playing a clicker game with just random stuff going by.  I've played magic semi professionally in my past and totally understand rng, deck building and the mechanics of the game.  

Its kinda strange because they made the game complex which instantly shrunk the crowd they could attract and made me think that as a advid card gamer, I could really get into it, but then they add so much randomness to it, it just takes any depth away, since you can pretty much get snowballed out turn 1-3, then have a random few targeting things not go your way and game is done.  Could even be less than that.  And yes it can go your way, but the amount that can go your way or the opponents is just a rng coin flip every turn.  I've seen so many of my games that I was easily winning due to strategy deck building and deck building rng, and then totally lose it to 3 heroes attack 1 minion two turns in a row, or get no summons in a row for like 3 turns and only need 1 summon to win.  So way way way to much rng losses for my liking.
If you want a strategic and deep card game, this is fantastic. I would recommend it purely on that; however, the following are missing which could be a huge turn off for you and may be a reason why you may not want to buy in just yet

1) No progression at all. No account profile, rankings, history, etc etc. Really moronic. Doesn't take away from the gameplay at all, but may take away from your enjoyment of the game. It's frustrating to go on a losing streak and not have anything you're working towards

2) Getting packs for free is pretty much not going to happen. 20 cards recycle into 1 ticket, which is 1 chance at getting 1-2 packs if you win 4-5 matches before losing 2 in certain modes. Moronic, because those cards most likely sell on the marketplace where you can at least use that to then purchase cards you need. If you're an average player, you won't be making this goal and will feel frustrated and again, without account progression, question why you bother pressing launch. It feels like a vicious cycle that you have no other option but to spend more money into an already $20 game. Players arent expecting insane amount of handouts, but being able to some extent grow your collection naturally even through lengthy goals would give great incentive and quell the freaking out

Great game at its core, that is overshadowed by quick launch missing core features of a "live game" with a questionable monetization behind it. Although to be fair, they are targeting the more hardcore card gamers that are familiar with dropping some $$$ to be competitve so it's now that outlandish for that target audience. This though causes the new players and more casuals to be upset and question it.
well, i got this game to play with friends and i cant 1v1 draft like i though and now i cant even refund it cuz of the 10 starting packs i got, dont get this bs and go play shadowverse or HS, the better games
Was really enjoying playing this game in bot mode. Then decided, hey! Let's try against a human "of equal skill" according the game. Was matched against someone who had obviously spent some decent money building his deck and got completely annilhilated. Despite the very high entry price point, it looks like you need to drop quite a bit more for a decent deck just to compete, as the starter decks just can't compete.
While the draft gameplay is brilliant, and easily worth the initial payment, the game is currently a bit disappointing and as much as I love the concept and mechanics and themes as a Dota 2 fan, the game bugs me in several ways:

- The full set costs around 250-300 euros. Most of this value is in the playsets of the few good cards of every colour. Now, I'd be more willing to pay this if Valve didn't tax the shit out of cards on the marketplace. The taxes (and release of new sets and time) lead into cards not retaining their value, and therefore I cannot justify the several hundred euros as some sort of an investment. 

- The game lacks balance and is full of heavy RNG-mechanics. Now, these could be fixed by balance updates. Which Valve has claimed to avoid as long as possible, maybe to mimic the real-life TCGs more and to make cards preserve their values (which they already do not). If they change their mind and manage to do balance updates (and hopefully card reworks for stuff like Cheating Death), I'll come change this review into a positive one and maybe throw some more money on the screen. Balancing a digital game around new releases, while leaving the previous content into unplayable state is just lazy and greedy design. 

- The lack of basic features, such as chat and ladder ranking/progression system. These are coming sooner or later, but for now the game feels quite empty to play. No interaction and no challenges.
Artifact has some very fun takes on the CCG genre. Functionally fighting 3 battles at once is cool and does entertain. HOWEVER! It suffers from the same old CCG problem, which is that it's 100% pay to win. Cards are drawn randomly from $2 packs and you just gotta hope you get good stuff.  This is the same problem with Magic, etc, so it makes sense the creator of Magic would continue this approach. I give it a week before people are just getting straight up outmatched by big spenders. Cool idea, but too expensive long-term.
The pay-to-play system of this game simply ignores basic human psychology. It does not feel good or rewarding to progress in this game, especially in the face of incredible new progression systems from its competitors like Gwent.
I wanted to try this game and give it a chance since it´s published by valve and we got steam because of them.

But I REALLY regret that now.

First of all, I didn´t like it after the tutorial so I asked for a refund.
They falsely claimed I had already consumed or transferred any of the items that came with the game, which isn´t true.
I bought the game, played the tutorial and left it there.
The 10 Packs you get for starters where still unopened.

So I asked for a refund a second time, same claim.
Maybe something comes with the game that is consumed while playing through the tutorial which seems like a ridicolous trap to get the steam refund out of the way.

Then I gave the game a try in casual PvP.
If You win a game in Hearthstone for example you get something of a reward (Gold to buy packs)
Artifact doesn´t reward you. You get a victory screen and will be linked back to the menu.
No progression system of any kind.

This seems not too far from counter strike where one may have an account level which is barely relevant and most "progress" comes from having a good time while getting better at the game.

However the big difference between the two games is. In Counter strike, every player gets the same weapons and chances of achieving them without paying for each weapon.
In Artifact you have to buy the cards and there is absolutely no way of achieving them by playing.
And that AFTER you already spent 18 € on the game itself.

Compared to Hearthstone which is free to play AND features the possibility of getting boosters with new cards through playing, Artifact seems like a scam. And that without mentioning that with every marketplace transaction where you buy a card from another player steam earns another 15% of the card´s value.

Giving this game a try was such a depressing experience that it will surely affect my future decisions of wether I´ll give other valve titles a chance or not.
Until the implement a way to get cards without paying for them, so you can decide to grind or buy.  I do not recommend this game.

Sad too because I love Dota and I love this game, but it just reeks of a money grab.  And don't feel inclined because you get a free month of Dota Plus, I have Dota Plus and its virtually useless.
Okay gonna say one or two shit about this game

First, playerbase is so fucking dead. You have to play guys that overlevels you and you may fight with the same enemy all over again. How ironic right? Only 1.5-2k players after only 3 months.
Second, the cards have no longer value. Which means the game doesn't deserve 20 USD anymore. I am not saying I bought the game for cards or anything but at once you got a chance to get the game free or even profit. Now the cards are valued less and everyone have them. 
Third, don't buy packs or don't play the game to get them. They give you shit. Literally. At best you can profit 1 or 2 usd atm. Well, there is another thing that you can buy shitty cards for cheap and turn them into tickets but it doesn't effective as before.
Fourth and the last but not the least, the game is good at core as everyone says. Graphically and techinacally good. Looks good, runs well. But the game lasts too long for many players which could be dull and tiring. On the other hand Valve tried to add some ranking system and progression to the game but failed in my opinion. You can get card packs up to the level 16 then some shitty avatars. Who cares at all? There is still no feeling of progression. There is also some sort of ranking it always goes up and it is pretty dull as well. 
 The game is often based on luck. Of course you can try to outsmart your opponent by thinking and planning ahead of them. However, it doesn't really work at some case because there are some fucking cards that fucks up your tower in one hit if it's below 20 or some cards can fuck your whole lane up and they can get 3 of those cards into their deck. If they got a card that you wouldn't like then you're done for. Even valve tried to change some of the heroes and cards and add some features the game still fails. 

Lack of fun. You can win the game buying some goddamn overpowered cards at critical moments that can happen pretty fast and randomly. You can't ALWAYS outsmart your opponent, try to flank them or gank them or anything like that. Some of my playtime is fun though, spesifically at the beginning times which everyone didn't have all the cards like Annihilation, Time of Triumph etc.
Game's not for me. It's a legitimate card game gone digital which is neat, but the ruleset is too complex to be enjoyable. It's difficult to know if a play I did at any given point was good or bad because of the way the board and turns work. Not to mention the inability to place creeps and heroes where you want them on the board is incredibly frustrating. I would also recommend that they increase the value of killing enemy heroes because as of right now it feels like you're just giving them the ability to move them to a different lane if they want to. It doesn't seem strong enough for what you have to invest into doing it and no momentum is gained by killing enemy heroes like you would expect.
Reasonable card game, but I expected more from the creator of Magic. Too much RNG for it's own good. Also, the art style and conceptual source material is not my cup of tea.

The monetization model is atrocious. MTG only got away with it because it was physical and the first of it's kind. Ah, of course, Valve gets a huge chunk of your money if you sell cards - that's the whole point of the game, right?

Considering even MTG online is being phased out for Arena, with a more modern monetization, it's simply incredibly Valve tough they could get away with it. Newsflash, they can't.
6/10

Artifact is an "EARLY ACESS GAME" with the potential to be the best card game ever
 
Gameplay is good but everything else is completely dogshit. Bad card balance. Bad monetization. Pay to pay to play. 0 progession system.

However, all of its cons can easily be fixed and i believed the game will be more complete within a year. 


This game can turn into 10/10 in the future  ( imagine 100+ hero and more card with proper ranking and progresssion system).

Buy this game if you don't care and want to have fun right now, but i recommend not buying it to force valve to fix this game faster.
Pay for everything.  No progression without paying.


Also, the game isnt actually that deep or strategic.  The RNG of where minions appear, and what arrows (which determine what direction your creatures attack), is severe.  For example, your 12 attack hero might get an arrow pointing at an enemy hero and kill it, giving you gold and removing the opponent's ability to play spells in that lane.  Or it might instead attack a basic minion in the other direction, doing basically nothing.  This is unnecessary bullshit RNG, and it swings games.

Artifact is kindof like playing 3 games of hearthstone at once.  Complete with the bullshit hearthstone RNG.  Randomness kills the depth.
Bottom line: this game is using you to fund tournaments for the very elite streamers that they gave beta access to.  The hope here is only to get an esport game going that revolves around money generated at the expense of your everyday gamer, just trying to have fun. It's clear why beta access was not granted to us little people. We would see it was not intended for us.

I get that this game has a bit of strategy involved towards winning.  Not purely rng such as HS.  But I just don't get it.   LIke why play?  Just for enjoyment?  Well, there are plenty of ways to find enjoyment and still feel like you are actually progessing towards a goal.  I don't really understand the goal of this game. Is it just to see how many tickets you can win?  And grind towards a few free cards. It's pretty clear the developers want cash more then they want you to be rewarded.  For me there is no incentive to play.  Just say you go out and buy every card available. Now what? Ok, you want to play in tournaments for prizes.  That works.  I see that motivation.  If there is a large enough audience that takes that path I can see the game having a future.  But for casual players like myself, It's quite boring.

For example.  I like to play texas hold-em.  Add real money the game gets quite addicting if you are comptetive.  But just to play texas hold-em casually, while fun, gets boring quickly if you are not being rewarded in any other way then just passing the time.

So let's say you play the game for 3 hours staight.  During that time you probably got in 7-9 games.  For a competive player tournament bound or streaming time played is probably is not relevant.  But for the average Joe, what have they achieved?  Maybe a few tickets and fun.

Now compare that to HS.  Regardless if yoo p2w or a casuall player you can at least feel like you are achieving something.  Rank, gold, or cards, and it much more interactive.  Just my thoughts. I get the feeling this game was designed soley to enrich and give nothing back to the community.  Everyone deserves to make money for their products but I just dont see how the average gamer can afford to play this game.  You will probably never to read this:}
It's not bad but the 3 lanes tends to slow the game down a bit. I like the concept it. Anyone familiar with hearthstone will feel that the voice acting is vaguely familiar.. 

im ambivalent about the game. it feels like the they've made the same mistakes as blizzard did with hs and no doubt there will updates a apleant in the next few months.

None the less, dispite eagerly awaiting this game it has been an aniticlimax and I'm not geeting the enjoymernt and laughts I thought I would out it of.

I'll play it again maybe in a few months. 
 

Mediocre at best. Has massive balance issues, gameplay is somehow underwhelming and sometimes downright rediculous. The fact that you can't control what your units/heroes hit or defend is super annoying. But my biggest problem with the game is that it is super SLOW, oh mah gawd the neverending animations and the waiting waiting waiting... 
This game needs work, I've played a lot of Valve games and I can truly say this is the first time I've been really disappointed. 
Nobody should spend money on this.

P.S. They also advertised that you get a month of DotaPlus with the purchase. Yeah that never happened.
im totally disappointed , valve have made a money graber machine. 
enough with pay to win , the sadest part it that i cant get a refund bcs ive opened some packs ingame .

Do NOT waste your money on this.
Would refund this "Game" if I had the option. Why do you think HearthStone did so well? I can tell it wasn't because people loved to fork over more cash just to be able to play the damn thing. Not only is it free to get into, but you could also work your way up the ladder by just playing and getting in game coin to get new and better cards. This feels more like a demo that I paid for. Like "Look at all the kewl strong cards you could have for the low price of XXX.99" Stay away from this it's not worth the time or money.
Horrible montization. Paying money to play competitively stands against what Valve stood for. Very dissappointed.

Can't refund once you open a pack. Such scam much wow.
Get past the monetization and if you can forgive that part a lot of people seem to be happy with the core game play.

But no. Match after match after match they all end with "if I get lucky arrows in lane 1 and survive, I can kill him in lane 2"

And that's... boring. It reduces skill and deck building ingenuity down to a series of coin flips. Match after match you'll be fucking livid when you get screwed by any of the many many aspects of RNG. When it works in your favor, that's great, but it does leave the win feeling pretty hollow.

Prices are tanking instantly on day 1, so I guess if you want to waste some time in it and fill out the card list off the market for like $35 (minus a few rares like Axe and Drow) then I suppose it's not terrible as far as that goes.

But getting **really** invested in Artifact? Not until the expansion proves this game can do a lot more than just look pretty.
Hmmm, It is a hard to master game. If you accept the packs you can't get refund(, which is kind of lame since if you want to try something else than the tutorial you need the cards)

matches take a bit to long to allow for casual play.
A good card game with an abysmal monetization scheme. 

It doesn't help that the Artifact community is generally cultish, bred and fed on physical TCGs, justifying the absurd price cost of card games (which development costs are way inferior to any AAA game out there).

If you like constructed, you'll NEVER be able to play this mode without forking over more and more money, but Reddit will tell you that you should only play draft anyway (cheeky!).

There are a thousand other problematic issues, long story short don't buy this game till they change their economic model
There is no way besides the first 10 packs to get new cards without paying.
This means that there is no way to acquire the complete collection without paying more.
This greatly limits the already limited tactics/strategy in the game.
Not great even if its free to play. To pay something for this nonsense is ridiculous.

On gameplay, there are too many flaws in the design of this game.
At the start of each round, minions' are added randomly into lanes, and their positions are randomized. This causes make or break situations in the mercy of rng
Only drawing 2 cards per round while you have to manage 3 lanes is just silly, and greatly restricts your control in the game.

Might as well make a game that toss a die to decide the winner and sell for $30.
this game has pros and cons

pros: 
it's sort of funish to play
it isn't as hard to learn as people claim especially compared to actual dota 2

cons:
you have to buy fucking 10 dollars in packs to play arena??? and the game costs 20 dollars whereas hearthstone is free and arena is 2 bucks a pop and you can earn more gold through dailies and arena awards. valve is coming in late to the game with a less fun product and asking for payment and micro payments not just for skins but it's fucking PAY TO PLAY

fuck that
Cool game but right now there's not much to do. You can buy cards and play constructed for fun or take the challanging way and try grind the packs one by one. Unfortunately game is RNG based and some cards are very imbalanced to the point that drafting and playing them means almost an instant win. Lot of times you just lose a game before playing a single card because opponent has better heroes that got better spawn RNG.
Giving it a "No" to encourage Volvo to
- fix the ridicoulos RNG spawns and RNG attack cards
- fix heavily over/under powered cards and heroes
- implement better rewards
A complete disapointment... i want it to refund the game btw and the geniuses in steam said i cant even i had less than 2 hours played and bought the game literally 1 hour after i try the refund...ffs
This is the first game on steam, i really want to refund but i couldnt anymore.
I make a mistake, i should listen to my friends warning, im so greedy, i wasting money on this uncomplete game. Daym , i feel so angry to my self while i write this review.
I wouldn't recommend this game with a high pay-wall to nourishing your card collection.
You pay $20, and you only get 5 tickets. (With the 10 packs, but who cares about 10 packs, you can't make a decent deck with "only" 10 packs)
New players are going to lose these 5 tickets easily against experienced players who've been playing since beta, it's just not worth it when there's no grinding mechanism to obtain new cards.
Pay more, or no new cards. This is the underline reality for fresh starters.
The game itself is quite enjoyable but it is lacking many features. Here are some of my complaints...
First of all it has a horrible economic model if u dont want to constantly spend money on the game. Since there is no regional price due to market, it hurts the playerbase in many countires. Being have to pay more to play competitive mode is such a joke.
  
Secondly there is no progression system or a profile page that u can track your statistics. No ranked system.

Some cards are game breakingly op (like axe and drow ranger) and they said, they wont get nerfed because of market value. ( yea appereantly market is more important than game(balance) itselfs) Constructed is a joke due to op cards. 

Some wierd rng. Among the card games I have played, this game has one of the least impactful rng but still it can get realy annoying(looking at u cheating death) and game changing. Creep spawn doesnt have to be totaly random. Why not make it 1 creep spawn for each lane every turn? Rng in this game is not horrible imo but can still use some improvements.

No social interactions. Cant chat with opponent. No rematch option after a fun dead even game.
 
This game is considered as trading card game. Except u cant trade. Like come on. 

The share valve gets from card sales in market is realy high. 

So the core of the game is fun and i will still play time to time but at this state its hard to recomend the game to anyone.

Edit: After telling us that they wont nerf cards unless it breaks the game because of market value, they just sold the game (value packs) for $9 2 weeks after release. Just dont buy this game if you dont want to get scammed.
The experiment to turn traditional CCG economies was a bold one, but it just doesn't work ; there is currently absolutely no reason to play the game. There is no progression, no sense of direction or goal to be had. It's as if Half Life 2 was a sandbox wave survival shooter. The guns are cool! The movements, physics, system - all great! Yet the game itself is boring.

The mechanics in Artifact, the lane / hero system with multiple phases is incredibly fun! It is an awesome card system in a garbage economy package with nothing to do. 

The review is a very regretful "Fuck no". For now. Valve can make it work.. They really can... God only knows what happened to make them release this unstructured pre-alpha.
Artifact in nutshell:
- buy the game
- buy best cards or loose
- new meta comes
- buy new best cards or loose

Thanks, but we have the same game called HearthStone, that game also stole my money.
This game gets so many things right yet I honestly can't say I have had any fun with this game. This is weird considering the amount of hours I have in it. I found the game interesting because of the mechanics but that didn't save it from the issues that plague it. The main problems with this game are as follows, the amount of RNG that Richard Garfield put in to this game is a disgrace, the next issue is the monetization model I honestly can't believe how awful it feels knowing that you can't do anything meaningful in this game without investing more then the upfront cost. I knew that it was going to require more money going in to it this isn't my first card game but it feels wrong to charge your customers up front in order to have access to the game and then nickle and dime your customers after they bought in. When Valve finally decides to overhall this mess of a game I would gladly play it again until then stay far away and if you regret your decision like I did then make sure you cash out now before the market collapses due to others leaving the game.
Devoid of content, it is very nice for the Dota lore and whatnot and has a nice amount of polish but needs a LOT of work before I can recommend someone buy this. Probably should have been an Early Access game in it's current state.
Blatant micro-transaction machine. You pay £20 to be allowed access to waste your money on core game elements that do not come with the purchase of the game.
Trash server.
Always disconnected from the server during the expert game recently.
I can visit any website instead ARTIFACT INTERNET CENTER. Really sucks.
The single least enjoyable card game I've played.
*There aren't any left of center strategies or angles of attacks here. The game seems to largely be about reading the board and maintaining tempo and all colours have tools for this which leads to muddy feeling identities. Only Black feels distinct with its roaming cards and cross lane damage, everything else feels like a neopolitan blur.
*Ironically, despite the reward for tempo control the turns are glacially slow with irritating overlong animations for pretty much everything. Games regularly exceed 20 minutes sometimes taking 30 or more.
*The flop and creep RNG detract from the much-hyped strategic nature of the game. There's a reason Kanna has a tier 1 deck and that reason is largely bullshit mitigation.
*There are also obnoxious RNG effects that never should have made it out of closed beta: I'm looking at you, Cheating Death.
*Draft isn't a very level playing field since you're not drafting from the same packs as the people you play. Feels great running into double Axe while you're cruising in the 3+ default lane.
*The rewards are miserly given the costs of entry.
*The monetisation is straight disgusting. 

People have gone on and on about how this is so much better than freemium games, and perhaps it would be if it were priced in such a way that it was noticeably cheaper than those games. Tickets at 1USD, Packs at 2USD. You really aren't far off paper drafting prices for a digital product and the digital product is a vastly inferior experience. Additionally, these prices are fixed globally. People in poor nations can just shove it I guess. It's hard to imagine valve doing anything but raking piles of cash in hand over fist even if they were to halve these prices. The only expert mode that's reasonably priced is phantom draft, but that would be a lot more enjoyable if you were playing a fixed set of games rather than double elimination. I drafted a sweet blue green deck and didn't get to really play it since I ran into the aforementioned Axe-wielding maniac one game then got utterly crushed on the flop the next game. Man, sure would have been nice to get to actually play that deck once!

Constructed appears already solved as a format, which, if correct, would speak to a lack of depth in the Call to Arms set.

I will probably hop back into the game for the first couple expansions' draft analysis to see if there's a more interesting sprawl and if gameplay has sped up, but I'm not holding my breath and I wouldn't recommend holding yours.

Actually, I might not return at all. The more I wrote here the angrier I got I can't think of any other game that made such a shitty impression beyond my big 3 shitshows: Diablo 3, Guild Wars 2 and Hitman: Absolution. It's knocked hitman out of 3rd. Valve should have known better with this one.

TLDR: A solid gold turd they need to melt down and shape into a more enjoyable form paying particular attention to action speeds. I'd have refunded if I hadn't been required to void that ability to actually play ticket modes.
After playing for around 40h I have to agree with other "review bombers" that this game is missed opportunity to bring the genre further. There are definitely some good improvements, but overall RNG element is definitely big con.  Plus the market makes it expensive to play the deck you want, thus creating at least partially Pay2Win environment - which is especially a shame when you compare to DotA 2 that is completely free to play (absolutely no in-game advantage for paying players like myself).
I've tried really hard to like this game, like beyond what is reasonable.  I really wanted it to be the big competitive esports card game.  I actually like the ability to buy specific cards and not have to grind them out or try to get them all from random packs / crafting BS.  At the end of the day though there is too much working against this game, from stupid RNG mechanics to poor card balance, with a multitude of issues in between.

The bottom line is the game doesn't give you a reason to care or continue to play, and I can no longer pretend there is one to trick myself into continued play.
Garbage game everything depends on rng. Only for ppl that wants to gamble with money but for that you have poker aswell which has less rng than this shit.
Honestly just isn't fun for me. It's too complex to be approachable also has annoying RNG. For example, you cannot place your heroes in specific locations. Addtionally, some cards are 50/50 that offer amazing benefits or nothing. This polarizes game play in a way that just isn't fun. Maybe I'm not their target but it just didn't capture my time or attention. Also I think the lack of social features and poor monetization is the last straw.
Was fun for the first week but slowly all the casual players have left and the only players left are the whales who spent major money on the best cards.
I dont mind the price and the fact that you have to pay for cards. But what i cant stand is too much rng and this game is full of it.. The placement of your minions, of your heroes on the first turn, random abilities and even the path they chose is completly random and it feels like your decisions dont even matter.. I played a lot cardgame (hs, gwent, magic, faeria the elder scrolls legends) and this is a rng-fiesta if you compare it to any of those games. Even hearthstone has WAY less rng than this game. And it does not even feel good to win if you got lucky..
Bought it, Sold all the cards(never planned to collect the cards), Basically got ~55% back (my bad luck?), now I got a cheaper game only for "Draft Mode" without the pressure of needing more cards.

Why the bad review? Because this game should be free with no cards OR $20 with cards. I like play to win not pay to win so trying to sell me on buying cards isn't happening but the gameplay itself is alright, not great.
I had such high hopes for this, the production values are excellent, the game is slick and beatiful and the art top tier.

That is where the positives end though. The player base is tiny now, so all you will run into is the same broken overpowered red/black red/green decks over and over again. It is so disheartening to be forced into these long drawn out games against mindless netdeckers, where you have very little hope to win.

The playerbase is incredibly toxic too, probably the worst I have ever seen. On then rare ocassion I can get a win against one of these red deck using people, you are hurled abuse.

Valve seem to show no interest in fixing these broken decks, so thr game will continue to die. What a spectacular flop this game has been.
As someone who loves CCGs, this game feels like it should be in open beta. It's very pretty, but there's a lot going on in terms of information to parse, and the interface doesn't make it easy to look up the many new effects and keywords it's constantly throwing at a new player. The interface also doesn't make it easy to parse the information of where effects are coming from and what they're targeting.

I understand that it's a bit like having best of 3 in a single game, the two consequences of the three lanes are that it asks you to parse a lot of information, even as a new player, and the time to play a single game is more comparable to an entire best of 3 round in another CCG. The amount of information to parse is also exacerbated by a turn timer that's very unforgiving to new players. Furthermore, the long play time and confusing mechanics for even someone who plays a TON of other CCGs  means I couldn't figure out the game well enough to determine that I dislike it until I'd spent more htan the 2 hours of play time that Valve allows for returns, so I'm wondering if I'm going to be stuck with a game that I'd have to spend a hell of a lot more time trying to figure out the obfuscated basic mechanics of, or if I just loathe what it is entirely.

The tutorial is poor, there's nothing that's explained to me the random elements of the game like whether your creeps are attacking directly forward or not, how cards are selected from the market, how freely spawned creeps are delegated to your lanes, or what spot in a given lane your hero is going to go into if you delegate them to it.

Draft at no point explains that if you draft a hero out of your 1st pack you can't draft a 2nd hero out of it. It appears to me that you're stuck with having to play whatever 5 heroes you draft... and i you ever happen to be forced to pick a hero in a faction that you weren't planning on playing at all, the experience you'll have as a newbie is feeling like your draft is off the rails because you're now forced to employ a hero in a faction you weren't even planning on playing yet. Best as I can understand (again, nothing is well conveyed to a new player) you can be forced into drafting an archetype that's literally not open from your draft seat unless you're cautiously and quickly drafting on faction/color heroes.

I paid $20 for what was supposed to be a finished game, but I feel like I'm ina paid for closed beta that was designed perfectly to be unrefundable by Valve's standard refund rules. I'm going to stick around a little while longer and see if it's worth it to have access to the casual phantom drafts and see how long it takes for me to understand some of the finer points of the mechanics, but once I do understand what I've bought if I decide it really is just awful like my first impression suggests to me it is I wonder if Valve will refuse to refund me because they sold me a $20 game stuffed full of microtransactions that gives you a job in the form of trying to grasp how it works, a job that takes long enough that I think they may not refund me even if I judiciously make sure I don't use any of my 'free packs' or 'free event tickets.'

But hey, Valve. Once I figure out the game, if I decide to ask for a refund, I'll edit my review if you prove me wrong and give me my money back.
Now both positive and negative reviews have some solid points in them, but for me, the biggest problem lies in power creep that is in Artifact even before first expansion. 

That was "cool" 20 years ago in some physical cg s; one card being obviously better than the other when counting raw stats or actives or whatever. But in 2k18 stuff like that shouldn't happen. Notice how best, almost auto-include cards have higher rarity.  You could argue, that people control market, and its going to be like this but there shouldn't be power creep to begin with.

'Printing' card just for the sake of 'printing' it is terrible design, and argument that you need bad cards so that good can stand out is even worse. 


I wanted to like this game, I really tried my best to be fair and give it a chance but I just can't and this is honestly one of the first games on steam I have ever regretted not refunding when I still could. 

I thought Hearthstone was bad but atleast there is an actual way to grind in it. In Artifact there is 0 chance or oppurtunity to grind, get new cards, develop your deck, or play for any kind of reward without spending money. Its obvious which cards are best, check the steam marketplace for which ones cost $20 and which ones cost $.01. There is no effort to hide broken game mechanics or imbalance because the player is expected to pay in order to do anything in this game and those who don't are thrown down a funnel of pay gates and rng until they only have 2 options: pay or leave. 

You get 10 free packs of random cards which most likely all suck. To get new cards you get 5 free tickets to play the reward mode (where you grind) but the tickets also cost money and in order to actually get new cards you have to win 4 games without losing 2 which is next to impossible without paying for the best cards because the chances that the random generation of cards you either have or choose from the draft mode being good are very low and the odds of you encountering someone who got lucky with better cards or bought better cards is very high. Once you use up the 5 tickets losing, you're out of luck unless you have more money.

The mechanics are just frustrating, you can't impact or choose the order of your cards or redraw shitty hands. You can't actually choose where in the lane to place them so you can't choose your engagements and placements its basically all RNG and luck. You can spend the whole match winning and outplaying your opponent only to get cheesed by the broken 2 turrets to win mechanic which functions like shooting the moon in that the one damaged turret that there are no enemies on can get gooned by lucky placement of creeps before you can react to it so you just lose. Speaking of cheese the game is dependent on 1 or 2 cards that get played at the end of every game and these cards decide who wins almost entirley by who gets to play theirs first, something determined at the beginning of the match at random. 

Theres plenty more frustrating things about this game but the TLDR is basically:
Broken, Unbalanced, Pay to win, Pay to play, Untested and poorly thought out mechanics, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY
The game requires you to download Steam Guard a WEEK in advance before you can sell cards. There was no warning about this and I've been waiting to play for MONTHS.  This is a huge turn-off as most cards I wanted to sell will lose value.  I dropped 100's of dollars in the beta for nothing.  I am a day 1 Steam account user and I find it extremely off setting that they did not warn anyone about it in game.


100% of the games are determined by the RNG :
- creeps randomly placed on boards.
- creeps randomly placed inside a board.
- spells with random effect (ex : 25% of chance to...)
- heros are also randomly placed on the board.
- guess what ? targets are also randomly selected...

And games are long and boring. 
Good to know, you can't get a refund if you open your boosters.
Perhaps you should include something that allows us to win free cards by slowly playing similar to dota 2 rather than this event ticket nonense, you could have been the chosen one to defeat hearthstone but you put yourself in a bad spot.
RNG the game. It will never be competitive. Wins and losses more often then not come down to a flip of a coin. Remove alot of the RNG and it would be a great game.
Terrible TGC, dont recommend buying it.
Currently there are only 2 ways to obitain packs and that is by buying each for about 2€ or (you guess it right) again by buying phantom draft ticket that costs 5 tickes for about 5€ and winning 4 matches to win 1 ticket and 1 pack or winning 5 (thats the most wins you can get) for 1 ticket and 2 packs. 3 wins gets you a ticket, if you cant get atleast 3 wins, guess what you'll need to pay another 5€ just to get tickets for draft. oh and btw lowest amount you can buy tickes is 5=5€.
Valve allowed beta testers to control market by allowing them to sell card on market even before game came out.
Business model seems terrible atm.
Only people who can recommend this game at its current state are probably Valve fanboys that cant see real flaws with this game.

EDIT: you know this game is a joke when Card alone costs more than game itself
After the freebies in the game, there's nothing more. No random drops, No in-game items to farm, just pure money grabbing sh!t. And that's all you got. You can then play all you want with given cards you got from the free pack nothing else. You can try the combos with free decks to play. At least DOTA and CSGO have random drops but this game is pure nuts, unless you rich AF.
I like card games and I'm ok with Artifact's mechanics... In principle. In practice, the game suffers from horrible balancing (which the developers promised won't be fixed) and this horrible balancing combined with their market means that the few good cards will have insane pricing.

I'm not one of those F2P lover who would rather grind all day than pay even a dollar.  I want a fun balanced game and willing to pay to play it, but not $200 at the initial release with all due respect. I don't need this game to be free like DOTA but I'd be very happy if Valve gives all the players the full collection for standard VG pricetag of $60, and then utilize the market to buy and sell premium version which look pretty but don't give you an advantage in the match.

I'll consider coming back to the game only after 1. It gets the balance patch it needs and 2. The prices drop to levels that make sense when you purchase a single new videogame.
Welp...

This game is really unbalanced, some cards are just way too powerful without any sort of "cost" for using them. (i.e. cards affected by this buff die after the combat round) You think you won a lane, and then BOOM, your opponent uses a card that wins them the lane in ONE turn.. Without any sort of set-up or skill.

It feels like it is in a Beta state right now, feels very unfinished, mind you the GAMEPLAY is great. Besides the gameplay, it lacks a lot of social features and player tracking (Can't track your MMR or anything of the sort).

I honestly thought Hearthstone was bad with its randomness of cards and unbalance issues, this game surely takes the cake.

This game is Buy to Play, then you have to spend money to obtain more cards. (I know, every other online card game allows you to buy cards) The problem with this game, is that it is very unrewarding in not only obtaining cards, but the whole aspect of the game is unrewarding.

Overall I would rate this game a 4/10, soley due to unbalanced cards and the lack of features I would expect in an online card game.


This game can be great over time, so I will revisit this in the future.


First of all, game is fun as a card game. But there are quite a few drawbacks that kept me from really getting into it.

many drawbacks are people already mentioned, like pay2pay economy system, lack of progression, no communication with opponent, greedy developer, bad-looking card arts, etc. I agree with all of them. But here I would like to focus to talk on the biggest no for me -----

That is this game is sooo freaking tired to play. I play other card games like hearthstone and gwent, they all seems fine to me, but for some reason playing Artifact make me exhausted so quick. After play 2~3 games a day at most and I just don't want to touch it anymore (sometime just 1 game if it lasts over 30mins, which happens quite frequently.) no matter you win or lose it didn't give you satisfaction or energy. The last game that made me this tired is Starcraft 2, which I didn't play long neither. To be honest, Artifact feels more like a Strategy game rather than a card game. but the thing is, if I want to play a strategy game, why don't I go for something like total war which is more fun and more visually appealing than this? When this idea come to my mind is the time I abandoned artifact. I haven't even used up my ticket yet, lol 

To conclude, Artifact is not a bad game from gameplay-wise, but it is not for me. I can see there will be tons of hard-core card games fans that enjoys it, but for my standard I want to have more chill and lazyness when playing a card game. So if you are not a really HARDCORE card game fan who is ok to sit in front of computer for >30mins a game, you should double think before purchasing it.


TL;DR: Save your money and buy Slay the Spire instead.

In a typical game of artifact, it never feels like you are in control. The RNG constantly gnaws at you, a couple of wrong arrows, a coin flip for your hero to stay in lane or not get stunned. People say they it can be played around, but those are only possible through cards, and guess what, drawing them is also RNG, so you have a couple of dice rolls before you can try do anything, which feels really bad.

Its just too boring to play after the first couple of matches. Heroes feel very uninspired. Most of them are stat blocks and feel samey after a while. Spells are the same, just +1/+2 to some stats. Not many cool effects. All these make the game a calculator simulator.

On top of this, the monetization has been god-awful. With a background of Dota, they would have been the primary audience of the game. Too bad that Dota players are used to the excellent free to play model and not the pay to pay model of Artifact.

Would not recommend in its current state at all. Instead, I would suggest you to play Slay the Spire instead. For about the same price, you get a fully fleshed out single player experience that is actually fun to play.
As an avid CCG player and a Dota 2 fan, this game offered fun game-play and interesting lore for the Dota universe. However, the game is ruined by the way you obtain new cards and card packs. The only way to obtain card packs is through the use of your Steam Wallet and actual money. There currently is no other way to obtain new cards and card packs other than to buy card packs directly in-game for $1.99, individual cards off Steam Marketplace, or by spending 5 card packs ($1.99 each) to receive your drafted deck in-game. I absolutely enjoyed the refreshing and new mechanics of the game. But, I cannot justify the amount of money you'd have to sink into this game in-order to truly play it.
In it's current state it's hard to recommend.  There's a lot to love about the game and it can be pretty deep.  However lack of cards to give good variety and too many random elements hold it back.  Card games like this should be mostly games of skill.   So randomness should be kept to a minimum. 

The chance of drawing what you want will always be of chance and it's something that can't be fixed.  I also don't mind cards like Luna Eclipse being random, but creature curve is just stupid.  Having a curve could kill an enemy hero or prevent a lot of damage hitting a tower that you wanted.  Curve randomness can greatly effect the outcome of the game.

Now I still play the game a lot.  As it is a very enjoyable still.  Just be warned and ready for frustration.  When an expansion hits and if they fix curving this will probably be a positive review.
bad game.

pay2play + pay2win = bad game

thewre is no way to aobtain cards in this game without spending money and there is no form  of progression whatsoever
this game sucks and i "immediately regret my decision" to have bought it.

too bad i cant refund cuz i idled my game for 30 mins and now i have over 2 hrs played.
I'm ultimately giving this a thumbs down, but before I go into all the things that are wrong about it, I want to take a minute to note what is right about it as well as respond to some of the less credible criticisms that it is receiving. First of all, this game is, frankly, beautiful. The care that Valve put into it is obvious, and it came out looking absolutely prestine. That's weird to say about a digital trading card game, but the graphics really are remarkable. Secondly, this was not something thrown together haphazardly or ripped from another trading card game. The lead designer was the designer of Magic: The Gathering, and despite the obvious kneejerk reaction being "Valve is just copying Hearthstone," this game is not even remotely like Hearthstone. Lastly, to those who are angry that Artifact is "pay-to-win," I can only note that ALL trading card games are fundamentally pay-to-win at least to some extent. I have never been a serious trading card enthusiast, but I have friends who tell me that professionally competitive Magic decks regularly go for over $200. Trading card games are not cheap, and that fact is not new. However, that doesn't mean that all pay-to-win models are created equally. And Artifact does do it really, really badly, which brings me to the review.

PAYMENT MODEL and GAME MODES. All trading card games are somewhat pay-to-win, but Artifact is buy-to-pay-to-win. You pay $20 to buy the game, then you spend another $40 if you really want to assemble a great deck. As of this writing, the best cards are floating between $5-15 each. And you MUST buy them if you want a decent deck. There are also competitive game modes in addition to playing casually or against bots. These competitive game modes offer a prize of a pack of cards if you manage to win 4-5 games without losing more than 1. But in order to compete, you must PAY to buy a ticket for each attempt to do this, and to stand even a remote chance of winning some competitive games, you must have already bought all of the cards to comprise a professional deck. In other words, you pay large sums of money to assemble a competitive deck, then you pay money to buy access to each competitive event, then on the rare chance that you actually win, your prize is... a pack of cards. The cards that you had to already buy in order to stand a chance.. to..... win them...? Whose idea was that..? It's absolutely nonsensical, and a shameless money pit.

UNTRADABLE TRADING CARDS. In a brilliant [sarcasm] move on Valve's part, the Artifact trading cards are not tradable. You read that correctly: you CANNOT trade the trading cards. You MUST spend real money on them. There is no simple/legal way to just give cards to your friends. By making the cards untradable except through the sanctioned in-game market system, Valve effectively ensures that the cards will hold a value well above what they probably would if they could be freely traded. Moreover, like the other items in the Steam Market, you can't just cash out your Steam Wallet, so it is a bit of a misnomer to claim that you got a "valuable" card. Even if you sell it, the money can't ever leave Steam.

NO SOCIAL ASPECT WHATSOEVER. The experience of playing Artifact is identical to playing bots, except some bots these days are programmed to taunt or trash talk and your Artifact opponent doesn't. Artifact currently includes:
-no chat
-no ability to friend request
-no rematch request ability
-no link to find opponent's Steam profile
-no record or replay of matches
-no visible MMR system (but invisible, yes) to know or show your rating
-no ability to trade cards with friends, as noted above
In genuine trading card games, people are not bothered by the pay-to-win aspect, because trading card games just developed as a way to derive more entertainment from card collections. You hang out, have a beer, play the game and check out each others cards to spark discussions. Then later your collection grows, you trade, eventually perhaps you get to an upper-tier of gameplay. None of this can happen in Artifact, because it is 100% asocial.

INFLEXIBILITY. For most card games that I have watched people play locally, mainly Magic or Yu-Gi-Oh years ago, something that struck me as interesting was that at lower and mid-tier gameplay, people could think of interesting strategies, build a deck around that strategy, and it could be a viable option that would stand a good chance of winning. In Artifact, despite the huge richness of game mechanics, the actual cards available and the abnormally strong pay-to-win element ensure that you're cornered into a few limited options if you want to be able to win games. For example, Artifact gameplay revolves around hero cards, and every deck must consist of exactly 5 heroes. There are many, many hero cards, but most are so bad that nobody who wants to win ever uses them. Axe, Drow Ranger, and Kanna are objectively top tier heroes in Artifact for numerous reasons. If you buy Artifact, you'll immediately notice that everyone seems to be using Axe and Kanna while dozens of other heroes get almost zero screen time. Why? Because those players got stomped by Axe and Kanna over and over, then broke down and bought Axe and Kanna. Because Axe and Kanna are great cards. Most decent decks revolve around the same tiny number of top-tier heroes, with a couple backup  heroes that play a lesser roll. And it isn't just heroes... You see the same exact cards of each colour coming up over and over, and it's just sort of boring. Nobody plays the other cards, because they tried and got wrecked repeatedly. So they either quit the game, or bought the "go-to" top-tier cards. 

PAY-TO-WIN, BUT DON'T. The most amusing part of the pay-to-win model to me is that this game has an invisible MMR system. So you get wrecked, get butthurt and go buy better cards. Then you win a couple. Because you paid to win... But then your MMR goes up and you stop winning again. Gee whizz, better go give Valve more money and pay to win a few more!  This can happen several times, then you'll reach the upper tier where everyone uses the same expensive cards.

The last one I'll go into is that aside from the previously mentioned problems with perceived balance problems and being forced to buy certain cards, I have to say that after playing dozens of games and logging over 24 hours, I find that this game is just extremely and generally unsatisfying. There is just something hollow about this game in spite of the rich mechanics. When you win, it's just sort of... whatever. When you lose, it's whatever. Often, you can't help but feel that the opponent just got a ridiculously lucky series of draws and that you were doomed from round 2 or 3. The mechanics allow for such extreme strings of luck that one player can in a single turn achieve a position that is virtually impossible to stop. Here's an example: on the SECOND turn of one game, my opponent played two cards which boosted his mana to 11. He then play Incarnation of Selemene, which provides essentially, unlimited mana. He also had out an Ogre Magi, whose special ability is a 25% chance to get an extra copy of any card you played. He then, in that same single lane of the same single round, proceeded to play 4 Foresights (+2 from Ogre) allowing him to draw EIGHT extra cards, then he played multiple creeps, multiple boosts, and an Emissary of the Quorum. It crushed everything in my lane, and the next round the damage count to my tower was -81..enough to end the game on round 3. The only way to counter things like this is if you just so happen to have a very specific counter like Annihilate in your deck and happen to draw it. Otherwise, you just lose. Period. And this happens A LOT.

Final recommendation: hardcore card enthusiasts who are content with seeing artwork and appreciating mechanics, buy if you want to have a look. Everyone else, especially those who expect this to be a fair or competitive game, I strongly urge you to pass.
This is a failure of grand proportions. Now, I'm not even talking about economy and monetization model, just the core gameplay. It's so full of randomness and disbalance, I can't even believe it. I mean, if it was an indie game made by some unknown rookies, sure, no problem at all. But this is a multimillion dollar company we're talking about with decades of game development experience. It's ridicuolous. Honestly, I can only see two reasons here for this: either this is a blatant cash grab or the game was simply in the development hell and nobody could do anything for some mysterious reason. 

Now, if you want some facts: 
[list]
    [*]You start with three  heroes deployed to each of three lanes. You can lose all three of them on turn 1 due to random placement and your opponent simply having more tough and powerful heroes. Which means your opponent has 15 gold advantage (which is huge), and on turn 2 you'll have 1 hero vs 4 of his. Guess what happens next.
    [*]There's a card Cheating Death which boosts a lane in such a way that there's a 50% chance that your units will not die due to a lethal damage on this lane. Yeah, you can feel true e-sports vibe already here.
    [*]There's a hero Bounty Hunter who has a 50% chance to gain +4 attack making it 11 in total, which one shots almost any other hero. Which means each turn you or your opponent will get frustrated by this passive ability depending on the outcome.
    [*]I think someone responsible for balance really liked red heroes. Because I can't imagine another reason for why there're so hilariously strong. For example, Axe has 7/2/11 (attack, armor, health), Bristleback has 8/0/12 but he gains +2 armor for each hero kill which is so convenient considering he one-shots most of the non-red heroes. For example, blue hero Prellex has 3/0/5. Or Ogre Magi - 3/0/7. And what is even funnier - most damaging spells do not penetrate armor.
    [*]If you don't know this already - you have no control over where exactly in the lane your heroes deploy or which direction they attack. There're some cards that allow you to do it, but playing these cards to fix it means you don't play something else. Or you might not even have those. Same goes for creeps - they attack in random directions.
    [*]Most cards are just modifiers like +1/2/3 attack/armor/health. Comparing to Magic: The Gathering it is so, so bland and boring. I buff +1, my opponent buffs +2, etc.
[/list]

I mean, seriously? And they advertise it like The Richard Garfield designed this game? Well, I hope at least he had some fun while doing it, because a lot of players certainly don't while playing it.

And what's most sad, this game easily could be absolutely amazing. I mean, the IDEA is great. There're three lanes of action, lots of decisions to make, lots of strategic potential. All you have to do is remove or rework randomness, balance heroes, add more interesting effects for cards, some abilities that not just modify stats, but DO SOMETHING ELSE. 

But frankly, I'm having a hard time believing any of this will be done. And there's no way this game goes big in e-sports with this balance and design philosophy in general.
Let's put it simple.
This is by far the worst game ever released by valve but honestly what you get with the 18 euros is worth the price. 
For the price you get 30% of the game and (depending on your tastes) the 20/50% of the fun. And for a card game it's a lot of time for only 18 euro. 
The rest is behind a price wall that goes from 60 to 200 euro, I honestly don't think it's worth so much even if I was an hard-core fun of this kind of games. 
Game at the moment seems more a WIP or early access, it lacks too much features and I think in this state it can die shortly. 
Gameplay wise is rough to decide so early even if I watched a lot of Gameplay and I put a little time on the game, but it is not clear for everyone I ear. Complexity not every time translate in deepness and most of the features are a little too boring (most cards are basic stats) and rng, even if you have a lot of way to play around it, it's a little too strong given the complexity of the gameplay. This means that a close game is almost always decided by too much decisions that are not not always foreseeable even for advanced players or by plain and simple rng. 
Games can be stressful/tense and long, but this can be a pro or a con depending from your taste. 
The tutorial is simply a lazy effort from dev side. The animations of imps are boring after a short time and some are awful (Zeus ult). 
If you play Dota there is a lot of lore, really a positive thing that can be useless for who has never played it. 
Music is really great but this give to me the feeling of a cold hearted game, I don't know why, like "here we are caring of this part of the game, I don't know who will care about the rest, we'll see". 
So, it's not a bad game, it's not a so good and it's not a cash grab because honestly it's too modest atm. I'd put a neutral review, it's worth 18 euro and the time you spend but since I expected more from valve I'll put this negative one, this is a lazy effort, sadly. 
I miss portal and half life.
Outragous pay 2 play model and there is no way to earn cards for free. It was fun for a bit, for about 20 mins in the first match, then I had to start browsing as my opponent took forever on each of the turns, making a match last upwards of 1 hour...much rather spend my time playing MTGO, also much less random matches. Maybe a few years in the future with fixed economy and fixed cards balancing, when there are many more cards and not just some cards which are stupidly broken.
Game sucks. There are only 2 options:
1. Make something good for the community - daily, weekly and monthly tournaments by valve with money prizes!
2. Refund everybody and delete the game.

Ofc valve will take option 3 - leave it be and slowly and quietly forget about this game.

[h1]REVIEW - 5 December 2018 - about 30 hours in at the time of writing this:[/h1]

I have played almost all the card games out there but before Artifact, I spent most of my time with HearthStone and Gwent. Blizzard went full casual and CDPR was proven to be incompetent to build anything that is not a single player experience. I was hoping that Artifact would be a fresh proposal in the market but unfortunately as the game stands I cannot give it a positive review or suggest it to other players. 

The positive first. The game is a blast to play. You always feel in control of your decisions and your moves are not directed just by the curve. You are playing for initiative and control of 2 out of 3 lanes. There is RNG in the core gameplay in the form of random spawning of creeps for both players but it feels manageable and doesn't break the game 95% of the time. The drafting mode is really fun and far better than anything that I have seen so far in any other digital card game.

Now to the bad. The game feels like it needs some balancing. There are bomb cards and there trash cards. The few cards that are in between are not enough to make it on their own without the bomb cards. There is at least one card that break the game (Cheating Death) which gives a 50% chance to every unit not dying when you are supposed to die. With games lasting up to 40 minutes imagine losing a game to that effect. It's infuriating. Yet Valve let this card exist in the full release of the game. 

The worst of the worst however comes in the form of the monetization model that this game has chosen. Anything you do in this game aims at making profit for the developers. You buy the game for 20$. You buy packs for 2$ each (no discount in bundles). You can sell cards in the market but Valve takes 15% of any transaction thus allowing them to make more than 100% profit from selling packs. And the worst offender of all, you have to pay a 1$ ticket (which you can only buy in bundles of 5 for 5$) to play in the competitive modes and only modes that give any sense of progression in the form of prizes (up to two packs and one ticket if you manage to win a total of 5 games). 

You can play casual draft for free which is one of the best features. But it quickly loses its allure considering the lack of rewards at the end of it. The free casual constructed mode is a joke as a free mode as you need to buy cards to play in it, so not really "free". 

For full disclosure, I am not against the 20$ entry fee. I am not advocating for a F2P model. In fact Artifact's model might be more affordable than that of HearthStone for people who want to get an entire collection . You can get all the copies of common and uncommon cards for about 30 dollars at this moment and that price is going to get even lower if more packs are opened. [b]My main problem that makes this game a rip-off is the fact that there is an entry fee even after you buy the game in order to play the competitive modes. This is absurd. Valve gives you 5 tickets to begin with and there is a huge psychological pressure not to lose the value. If you lose all of your tickets your only way of competing is by putting your hand back in your wallet. Why? You already pay for the game itself and new cards. Why pay for accessing the modes as well? [/b]

Another negative point is the poorly implemented social features. You cannot interact with your opponent. Although you can participate in online tournaments they are not automated and you have to clear a 5 hour block in your day in order to sit though the entire thing waiting for your turn to come. 

On a technical level the game seems to put some stress even to the most competent machines. My laptop is more than capable at meeting the required specs and can barely run this at full 60fps at low/mid settings. 

[b]All in all, I cannot recommend this game to anyone under these circumstances. The gameplay is fun but there are too many restrictions around it. The release feels incomplete as many of the features we heard from beta testers are missing. The game also lacks any kind of progression and even though Valve has said they are working on it, from what we have seen, we can expect it to have some kind of monetization as well. I am really disappointed in this attempt as I was expecting the savior of card games. It appears that the influence of Richard Garfield (creator of Magic the Gathering) affected the game's model by bringing the most outdated model from a physical card game to the digital area. This is a video game. There is no excuse to simulate all the aspects of the paper form. This could have been way more accessible and still would make a lot of profit, but no... They needed to make ALL the money. Just a lot is never enough. 

Stay away unless they make considerable efforts to make this more accessible. Personally I will enjoy it until I run out of in-game resources which should not take long. [/b]
To the crooks at Valve, make it so that people can refund this shit after opening the card packs instead of fucking over every single player, who had to open the card packs in order to play the fucking game. 

Yours truly,
An Angry Consumer.
After about 60 hours played, this is the first Valve game to receive a negative review from me.

Grossly imbalanced cards, less than impressive strategic depth, a very restricted meta. Wins are determined to an absurdly large degree by a) luck or b) how much money you are willing to invest in this game. The extent to which the player's skill is negated by certain fundamental core concepts is as astounding as it can be frustrating.

This game needs a major overhaul to reach the standards we are accustomed to with Valve games. Artifact is not recommended in its current state.
Pros
- Pretty cool and complex game with interesting mechanics
- Plenty of lores through voice acting and card text
Cons
- This game would attract a lot more players if it is free, having to pay to even play and having to pay more for cards to make progress is greedy way to monetize.
- Refunds are not available after free packs are opened, which the warning was written in fine print.

This game needs a demo to give people an idea on how this game works before comitting money into it.
Feels more like work than fun at the end of the day. Even winning seems very underwhelming. And this if a game where you are actually spending money to do any sort of match that means anything. So when you lose...thats $2 a pop. Save yourself the hassle and move on to the next game.
If you play dota you will like the game and I think its a good game but its not worth it's price tag. you don't get the most basic features of dota such as a profile, a chat, list of your matches, your average stats , how many games you won , how many games you played etc. Overall it's like you just play a game for the sake that you bought it or the fact that you are learning and still interested in it. It does not have any kind of progression system as in dota nor any visible mmr system although they say you have 50% chance of winning every game (i.e your opponent also has a similiar mmr to you), but there is no way to check that. And for a paid game, a card game none the less , they didnt include steam trading cards/badge for it. This game requires a lot more work than what has been put into at the time of this review.
You'd think you'd get value for your money, but as soon as you spend your 20 euro's you find out you hit paywall after paywall to unlock more cards. You can't unlock anything naturally, pricecard should be around 200 euro's in reality. Seems like a way to scam people out of theyr money by not being clear on this when selling a game.
Pro:
- Game is of good quality, nice graphics and animation.
- Inherited Dota 2 well
- Strategic and tactical 

Con:
- No daily quest or free access for card collection
- No card exchange between friends
- Time consuming as a card game

Overall, not recommended for the moment.
Monetization model sucks, no way to get free cards. Stick to the other digital cards games until valve decides they want to implement some form of progression that doesn’t involve your credit card.
Honestly, I don't mind paying money when I'm playing games.

That aside, I do believe Valve didn't do their best job when designing this game. It lacks content.
Content as in a ladder for constructed, achievements or anything that gives it replayability. Yeah, the draft mode is KIND of fun, but TOO much RNG really ruined that for me too.

I also encountered an annoying bug in which I didn't get the free decks after I bought the game, but oh well. After all Valve is just a small indie company.
At Valve apparently pay to win is acceptable as long as it's based around cards. It's safe to assume that this game wasn't any more expensive to produce than any other game that can sell you a complete package for $60 or under, yet they ask for so much more. Valve won't even give a definitive answer as to whether phantom draft will be permament or not. Expect card balance to be even worse than Hearthstone because they also have the market to consider here. This game has no competitive integrity, which is ironic considering it's based off Dota 2. 

You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.
11 years we've been waiting for closure on EP2.
And what we got instead is a boring, pay 2 win card game that nobody asked for.
I can't believe this is what has become of Valve.
After the tutorial rounds, I found that Artifact's monetization is even worse than I understood. You literally cannot play the game beyond the tutorials without forfeiting a refund. Even the modes that do not cost extra money to play require you to open the starter pack. I thought you would be able to skip that and just play the free draft mode, but you can't. You are essentially forced into buying a $20 nonrefundable license to play the game, no matter how you want to play it. This is fucking absurd. I don't care that there is a card economy where you can sell the cards you don't want. I care that there are microtransactions for ranked game modes. I would like the possibility to play the free modes. But, unfortunately, Valve has decided that you literally can't play those without spend $20 on content you don't want and that you also cannot have refunded. This is in the top 3 of the worst monetization models I have ever seen, along with NBA 2K series and World of Tanks. For real, I have no desire to play the for-pay ranked modes. I am only interested in plaing the for-free casual modes. But you cannot play them for-free. There is a $20 buy in that you cannot refund if the game is of enough interest to you to forfeit your refund on game assets you potentially won't ever use. I seriously do not recommend buying Artifact unless you see yourself spending seriously time into it and have no issue spending money even to play the "free" game modes.
Great card game without hearthstone randomnes, but with next level of uglyness monetization system. The servers arent working on the release - no packs and tickets for early buyers.
I really, really wanted to be able to recommend this game, but EVEN after only an HOUR of gameplay I can safely say this game has some serious, core issues that sucks all of the fun out of playing it. A first impression for this kind of game is extremely important and the experience was so broken it feels like a complete chore to play any further. [b]At this point, I find myself playing it for the sole reason that it is a valve game, not because the game itself is any fun to play.[/b] I'm a long-time, dedicated valve fan, and before you say that the only reason I'm giving it a bad review is "because it's not HL3" that's not true at all, I was extremely hyped for this game even though I've never played DOTA but it has serious issues that need to be fixed before I will consider changing my review.

[b]1. The game's learning curve is pratically a vertical line.[/b] I understand why this game is as complicated as it is. I'm not saying you should simplify it. However, the tutorials are, in its current state, essentially useless. It teaches you all of the blatantly obvious stuff ("Items purchased from the shop are added to your hand" YEAH NO SHIT SHERLOCK) but doesn't even touch the stuff that actually needs explaining. I literally had to google the purpose of the arrow cards that appear out of nowhere then dissapear just as fast, and every time the furry-fetish mascot imp thingies fly around the board placing cards everywhere I have no idea [i]why[/i] they're doing that, or what reasoning is behind the fact that the opponent gets more than I do or I get more than they do, because the tutorials don't actually teach you anything useful. Strategy is one thing, and that doesn't belong in a tutorial but BASIC EXPLAINATIONS of WHAT THE FLYING FUCK IS HAPPENING ON MY SCREEN would really be useful. There's also no explaination of what makes the end turn icon turn into a combat icon for the other player, so I have no clue basically when the actual combat will happen. Google time again.

Basically if online tutorials teach the game better than a game's inhouse tutorials then those tutorials need serious overhauls. Make it [i]three[/i] bot matches if you have to. Just don't leave it in its current state.

[b]2. Ragequitting is already on TF2 levels of bad.[/b] You're placed into a match pretty quickly, I'll admit, but as you will soon read, that won't really matter because people are allowed to forfeit whenever they want with no reprecussions for abandoning the match whatsoever. No penalty, no 5-minute matchmaking ban, nothing. In fact, out of the 5 casual matches I've played, THREE OF THOSE ended during the first round because the opponent quit just because I had a good start against them. Having the option to disable chat was a step in the right direction though, since now at least i don't have to hear "i fucked your mom" from all of the salty 5-year-old rich kids I'll undoubtedly be pitted against in the future.

[b]3. Gameplay gets repetitive often.[/b] In one of the two matches that actually lasted to completion, there was a lane where the opponent played like 7 cards when I didn't play any. That had me clicking the little circle icon for about 2 minutes straight while the opponent took his sweet time each turn waiting a solid 10-15 seconds before playing each card. Why anyone would consider this "gameplay" boggles me. At least while I waited I could I could watch the enemy furry-fetish imp thing wave its butt at my furry-fetish imp thing every time the opponent played a card with such [i]breathtaking, enthralling[/i] animations. [b][i]That sure oughta make players more patient![/i][/b]

[b]4. Microtransactions[/b] I won't go into detail here since many other reviews already do a good job at tearing this game apart in that aspect but what I will say is that the thing I'm angriest about is that fact that Gabe lied to us by saying "we're trying to move away from pay-2-win" and what did they immediately do out of the gate? OH YEAH! THAT'S RIGHT! YOU PAY FOR THE RIGHT TO BUY MORE CARDS AND EVENT TICKETS! Tf2 did it the right way by giving out weapons for time played and only pay for cosmetics. Too bad they realized that wouldn't make them as much money, and we can't have that can we?

Valve used to be a good publisher. But with Fallout 76 and now this in such a small timeframe I'm starting to lose faith in AAA companies alltogether. This game is not as shitty as FO76 because at least this plays bug-free but at least FO76 only sells cosmetics and emotes. Artifact is just not worth the investment at this point in time.

P.S. I've enabled comments because I trust that the community will be respectful to my views and not start a hate-fest but if this trust is broken I will be forced to disable them.
Looking past the abysmal business model, this game has way too much RNG for a game pretending to be a hardcore, competitive game. Creep spawn rng, attack arrow rng, cards like Bounty Hunter, Ogre Magi, Ravage, Cheating Death.
This game has as much as, if not more RNG than something like Hearthstone. You will win or lose games depending on RNG and it won't be few and far between, it will be every other game. Do not believe people telling you otherwise. 
If you're in the tiny minority of people that's alright with the business model and with the luck based gameplay, good for you. For everyone else, avoid this game like the plague.
I find no real incentive to play this game.
- game has no ranking system, or any sort of progression, and on top of that, you get no form of rewards for playing or winning, except if you spend extra money for tickets so you can play "expert mode" (since when is paying money to enter mode called expert ? )

- the "free mode" you get after paying to buy the game for 20$ offers absolutely no rewards, I won the gauntlet (5 wins) and clicked the "get rewards" and got absolutely nothing for winning...

- one game lasts 30 min on average which kind of sucks for a card game

- game is not even complete : there is no chat, no profile, no customization, no ranking system, nothing. 

- the price for entering the "expert mode" is too high. In order to enter this mode you have to pay in tickets... which you can only buy in packs of 5! For the keeper draft you have to pay 2 tickets + 5 booster packs. What in the heck...

Game is missing a lot of core functionality to even be worth a 20$ price. And on top of that you have to pay hundreds of dollars to buy a playable constructed deck.

This game and the transaction model behind is a disgrace for 2018. I wish I could have refunded but Valve made it impossible to refund, circumventing their own steam rules.

yuck
The game mechanics are great, making up for a very interesting gameplay experience.

However, the total lack of in-game rewards, makes the game lose all meaning. It's IMPOSSIBLE to get new cards without spending money. And playing any game mode that doesn't require a fee reward you with absolutely NOTHING. Not even an MMR number or rank, nothing at all.

That is a fatal flaw and there is no point in playing a game like that.
The gameplay in Artifact is exciting and novel. HOWEVER, it is very difficult to maintain any sort of interest. The current rewards system (how to earn new cards through "expert play") is only viable if you already have a larger card selection. The expert play for constuct is not worth attempting unless you have a few "key" cards (ex: time of triumph for red). Having this barier to entry encourages players to invest A LOT of money in order to get the full enjoyment from the game and it really annoys me/detracts from all the positive aspects of the game. I will most likely stop playing unless valve makes major changes to address this frustrating payment system.
I like card games, and have put a lot of hours into slay the spire, hearthstone, ect.  I also love dota and hard games!

This game feels very slow, the ruleset feels very clunky, each game takes nearly an hour.  But then I was like okay, I can put the time into learning it, until I realized that literally everything in the game cost money.

Then I realized theres no chat features, no ladder/MMR, and the most interesting modes cost money every single time you play them.

No thanks valve. :(
There is a good game here, but I really wouldn't recommend it due to the payment model. Card games really need to catch up to 2018, this kind of stuff shouldn't be acceptable anymore.
This game is great and all but really Valve!! 
There is no way to get cards except from buying . 
I'm already $20 down. If i knew i would get crappy cards in the free packs i would never have opened and get refunded! Waste of time.
Cause u never gonna win against expensive decks. 
Really dissapointed in valve! Im a dota player for so long... This is bullshit

There is no record of your win/loss. Like whats the use of winning ?
An enthralling card game that combines intelligent, expansive design and play while merging the essence of its source material - possibly one of the best digital card game experiences to exist. However, while I do not mind the TCG nature (purchasing and selling of individual cards) of the game, which I have made use of myself; I do wish there were a way to grow one's collection through a touch of gameplay progression - even the notion of mini-boosters for rewarding gameplay would go a long way towards further time investment in the game. As it stands presently, it's great to dip into every now and then, perhaps theory/money craft a few deck ideas, but that's where involvement ends. Indeed, I have been spoilt by other online digital card games, and not all games require a form of progression, but just a smidgen of a non-expert, non-ticket manner method in order to aquire more cards would truly solidify the game to me, at least in terms of time investment, which is perhaps the most important aspect of games to me these days. If there were a sideways thumb button, I'd be using that.
I really wanted to like this game. I played a lot of phantom draft and used up 4 of my tickets before I had to say "nope". I couldn't even bring myself to use the final ticket. I played very little constructed because of the high cost.

The Good:
-It's fun to pick up and play casually for draft -- you don't notice the issues right away, would be a perfect $5 game to binge on a weekend

-It is really simple to learn. The hardest thing to keep in mind is "what cards will my opponent have" but you'll learn that pretty fast.

-You can sell your cards, so the game costs closer to $10-$15 than $20 even if you get bad packs.

-The music and artwork is nice

The Bad:

1. RNG on the first turn can dictate the rest of the game

You don't decide which order your heroes are placed, where your creeps are placed, or which direction any of them are attacking. With the same hero/creep set up you can have one outcome where you kill all the enemy heroes and are able to play two improvements and Payday to double your gold... or just lose all your heroes. It just depends on how things are set up. It is absolutely bonkers.

2. RNG on "last" turns can save your opponent (or doom you)... or any other turn really

I don't mean top decking or what your hand is. I mean you can have lethal on your opponent and then your primary damage dealer has a ONE IN FOUR CHANCE of attacking an enemy that is already going to die and isn't blocking him. It's crazy.

Many cards are layout dependent -- Beastmaster's signature card a big one -- and the RNG determines the game. 

3. RNG from cards is pretty dumb

Cheating Death gives constant coin flips you can rarely do anything about, but it isn't the only one. There are a LOT of RNG-based outcomes in this game and outside of Blue you don't really have a way to keep your hand size large. That means the odds of you having a card that can circumvent the RNG from your opponent is low. 

Have a card that deals 3 damage to the enemy, use it to lethal an enemy hero, he survives due to coin flip. You aren't always likely to have another or enough mana to play it and, if you do, there's still a chance it can coin flip the wrong way.

4. Artificial "excitement"

The large amount of RNG elements will make the games constantly "close". By design it'll come down to "that last tower" over and over again, even with mediocre decks. If you pick good heroes and make brainless plays you'll almost always bring it down to one last tower.

5. General poor design only highlighted in longer games

The game has serious flaws at its most basic level but you don't see them until later in the game -- right before the game ends. Cards are designed to snowball and combo in extreme ways -- but only in the late game. Blue literally has an infinite mana combo that is meant to steamroll a single lane. Green has cards that increase in health, armor, and/or attack each turn and if you end up missing two turns then the enemy is basically impossible to kill unless you've designed your deck to kill large creeps. This is all relatively normal for a card game, but it stands out in Artifact -- especially drafts -- because most of these strategies aren't clever or difficult to pull off. They require one, occasionally two, cards and are set on autopilot. 

Its designed to make you think you've done something neat. Kanna automatically brings every creep into her lane. Play Diabolic Revelation -- which has her PICTURE ON IT -- and deal 2 damage to all those creeps. Then, use her SIGNATURE CARD to play hounds of war, summoning a creature for each damaged creature on the field. This isn't a clever combination, it is a *designed* combination and its all over the place in this game.

6. Hero balance is all over

If you could pick Axe or Pugna, which are you going to pick? It will be Axe 100% of the time. Even if you know improvements are coming and you want to kill them, his ability only allows you to kill one improvement in a normal game if it happens to already be in the lane you are in. MAYBE two, if you're lucky. Maybe you want Nether Ward -- 3 damage to the enemy tower vs. a blue deck is pretty nice.

Except Axe is still better because if you were able to cast Nether Ward turn two and Blue cast a spell once a turn for the next three turns, you will have now caught up to what Axe can do in one turn when he has a short sword equipped.

Axe without any signature card -- which is really good -- is still a better hero.

Drow Ranger is basically impossible to put away, Omniknight is maybe passable if you're really specific on your strategy, but compared with someone like Rix or Farvhan? No way. Its like this for every color.

The heroes you start off with suck, there are several mediocre heroes, and then there are 2-3 "must pick" heroes in each category. It's such a large divide that if you do a draft and don't get those heroes you're at a huge disadvantage. It's incredibly unfun to be drafting green and then end up being stuck with several Farvhan the Dreamer heroes and their mighty 0/6 creatures that fill up your deck.

7. Drafting itself is bad

I love drafting -- making the best of what you can get. But you know what drafting was like in Magic: The Gathering? You didn't draft lands. You drafted cards and then added the lands in after.

In this game, you need heroes to play your cards. Green plays green, blue plays blue, etc. In the draft, heroes are positioned somewhat randomly and only one at a time. If you pass the hero  up, they might show up again and they might not. You can literally pick only black cards and not see a black hero for an entire pack.

Instead of starting the draft with cards and ending with several heroes on the last page, or starting with heroes and then with cards, they mixed them up so its possible for you to just get a crappy draft through luck.

You can only have ONE hero picked per deck.... which means if you see Magnus show up and you need a green hero, but you want Drow, you're gambling between finding Drow, getting Magnus, or being stuck with Farvhan the Dreamer. If you pick Magnus and the next page shows Drow, congratulations -- you're screwed. It would make sense to just not show heroes and then show an additional card, but nope. Just says "look what you could have had".

8. The game is incredibly lonely

There are no social features to speak of. If you know people outside of the game you can organize a four person tournament. I have four people total on my friends list with this game and only one still plays it -- I couildn't fill up the tournament if I wanted to!

There's no way to match up with someone again, no way to talk or emote. It's just silent, every game. They could be bots masquerading as humans and I wouldn't know.

9. There is no progression or rewards

Playing games for fun is... fun. But progression is also fun, even if it is just showcasing stats. There's nothing to show you making progress in any way in this game.

10. Outside tournaments and events for this game are limited to the cool kids club

Most tournaments and events you see with prizes are limited to a select few twitch streamers and the like. There is no "scene" for Artifact, its artificially inflated and you aren't invited.

11. Every color is basically the same

There are some very light "themes", but ultimately you aren't picking colors. You're picking heroes. Items -- two of them randomly shown in the shop -- can completely circumvent entire strategies and offset weaknesses to the point that it doesn't allow for differences in the colors to shine until the end game.

12. Shop RNG

Shop are RNG is bananas. You have a selection that is randomly shown -- I can deal with that, even though that's a little weird. But they also present you with two totally different items. You can RANDOMLY be shown an item that can summon a 14/14 with Siege 6. Randomly!  In draft, you need town portal to move your heroes -- it can randomly be replaced with an item that heals 6 hp.

Avoid.
It is 2018 now not 1998, and you are still making TCG?  An ONLINE TCG??!!!

" I thought I paid $20 to buy a complete game for me to play, but I didnt know I just bought a chance for me to pay more."
game is good

but theres no in game chat
can't identify my opponent human or supercomputer AI because no way to talk
paid real money for tickets
always lose in expert phantom / keeper draft
my opponents must be supercomputer AI
by far the most advanced scam ever made

enable chat.
Paywall gameplay, awesome game with disgustingly greedy devs. Not worth the buy just yet, or maybe never if things do not change. For now  stay away....
The game is simply boring and matches take too long. 

It's insane that a typical artifact match can take more time than an actual Dota game.

On top of that, I really don't enjoy the way unit combat works in artifact. In Eternal and MTG, the defenders choose which units fight each other. In hearthstone the attacker gets to decide. The unit combat aspect of those games is really fun, immersive, and can be quite skill intensive. In artifact unit combat is largely decided by RNG but you can also sometimes spend resources to influence combat. I just don't find that fun at all.

I won't even mention the monetization scheme which has been thoroughly discussed elsewhere.
Played quite few games and drafts. Even when I'm losing to someone better than me it's just too slow. What am I waiting for. Pass the turn already and get going. 

I don't care about the monetization, I like the basic game. But the best experience is playing against bots, at least they're not wasting my time.

As it stands this game is not for me. It should be optimized for fast paced gameplay with like a timeout function or something for when you really have to consider a move. Or make it more like speed chess. 

I'm not going to boot it up again untill I see a big patch.
The game didn't accept my refund because of i open a box during the start of the game(force to open so that u can't get a refund)  The game is too hard to play only for 5 hours which was waste of my time and i highly recommend that you shouldn't buy this game
I'm a fan of Dota and TCGs. I don't even have a problem with the payment model, not dissimilar to MTGO, though tournament rewards need some tweaking. I was really looking forward to Artifact.

Holy shit is it a bad game. There is way too much RNG going on, the game is just not fun to play. I was absolutely the target demographic for this game and it still lost me. Probably for the best, if it was any good I would have dumped a lot on it.

Seemed like an interesting game made by a good developer but I can't recommend this in its current form. This game is heavily pay-to-win. I didn't open any of the overpowered cards and there's no way to get them other than paying $$s. Save your $20 and play this when it goes fully free-to-play.
Feel really bad for even purchasing this game. Thats money straight down the drain. Had a few fun games but it get s boring and shitty real fast. First of all you need to drop a lot of cash to get some good cards. Then they dont do anything cuz your hero was "accidently" placed infront of a creep. The randomness in this game is off the chart. 
DONT BUY THIS TRASH GAME. Ty

Artifact is a very fun and interesting card game. The concept of three lanes and color coded cards adds a breath of fresh air to card games.

While the above is true, Artifact is missing a lot of crucial features that would make it feel complete. The game still feels like it's a beta because of the lack of features. Here's a small list off the top of my head of very important features missing:
[list]
[*] No profile tab
[*] No match history
[*] No in game chat. period.
[*] can not spectate friends or rewatch games.
[*] Lack of MMR statistics
[/list]

These are just a few features that should argueably been included with the release of this game. At the current state of development I can not reccomend Artifact.
Game was fun when market worked properly.... Credit card is strongest card. Unless steam locks your market account for no reason every time you try to add money... then when you add authenticator it thinks you want all your sales individually confirmed under .10 cents... so selling cards is not worth the time and buying cards freezes your account.... Pay 2 win garbage. Crying shame they couldn't get their shit together since the gameplay is actually quite good.
I know that valve wants to simulate a real tabletop Trading Card game, so almost nothing is handed to you for free. But it isn't a real life trading card game. We dont have a physical collection of cards that we can shuffle through, admiring our collection and decks we have built up. It is a digital card game, treat it like one. Give us some way, any way, to earn packs for free. Fun game though, won't touch it again until they do add some sort of earning system.
This game is uninteresting. 

You won't gain any card for your constructed decks except if you pay money on top of the initial price of the game. There are "free" content though, in the name of draft modes. I will now focus on these modes for the rest of the review.

Crafting the decks sure is funny and requires some skills. But even if you come out with an interesting deck, most outcomes of games completely rely on the RNG.  Indeed, on turn 1, your heroes and creeps are placed randomly on the board, and depending on how the RNG goes, your heroes or your opponent's ones might die on 1st turn. This results in an incredible snowball because the 1st round winner will get coins, and thus be able to buy items to keep making good trades, while the 1st round loser won't be able to play cards for at least a turn in the selected area.

This is not my definition of an interesting card game. I'm very disappointed.
I never really post negative reviews for games but I can't in good consciousness recommend Artifact.

I had high hopes for this one. Some of the unique ideas (items/heroes/lanes) seemed interesting and like they could really put a spin on the original concepts from MTG. Unfortunately, it's just a dull clone, without any of the interesting card effects from MTG. Every card is quite literally just a statistic. Do X damage, spawn a token, add X health. That's about every hand dealt in this game.

I could complain about a lot of other things here too, but really at its core this is just a flavourless, uninspired copy of MTG. There's dozens of MTG clones that are free. Play those instead. Or play MTG. Just don't bother with this one. They were so busy adding more opaque mechanics and RNG that they forgot what actually makes a CCG fun: interesting cards.

Hard avoid.
ran out of tickets, now there is not a SINGLE card in the game i can aquire without paying anymore.

let this game die and come back to it when they thought their monetization over and then we can all have fun in this game

disappointing, lost a huge amount of money through by investing , the sell back does not even compensate too well either , f the market surge in overpriced cards feels like a scam now , I fell for it .. but had high hopes for this game , maybe I will keep my cards until something good happens ...who knows ????
This game has the makings of a fun CCG, except that it's not trying to make a fun CCG; it's trying to make DOTA2, but played with cards.

Lanes, randomly spawning creeps, an item store with a random selection, random unit placement in the beginning...

You can lose a match before you've even had the option to play a card, especially playing blue or black heores, if the RNG decides to put certain Red heroes against your hero, instead of against a creep.


In MOBA parlance, the RNG can literally feed a kill to a certain side, all based on RNG
This game is only worth it if you have some spare $ to blow and are a dota fan. 
When people joke that the best card in the game is the credit card, they are not joking. 

The only way to get packs is by using tickets to play ranked, and you have to win X number of matches to get a pack. If you lose a match you wasted a ticket. You get 5 tickets. The only way to get more tickets is to buy packs with real $ and recycle douplicate cards. See what happened there? Either way you spend money. You can buy individual cards as well from the market and I recommend that rather than gambling on packs. You get 10 packs when you buy the game, and unless you get god tier lucky in what you get, you're going to be spending money on extra cards/packs. Like most card games there are some staple cards and cards that are well prefered due to their versatility.  The gameplay is great aside from the system put in place for aquiring cards. The whole system is revolving around giving Valve more and more money. 

Avoid this game unless you are already a big dota fan.
If you are reading the reviews to find out if this game is a pay to win, you are right! I am really disappointed that i bought this sad sad game. Would there be anyway to give this back to Valve? The part that got me is the only way to get more packs is to use a ticket to play others in a gauntlet style matchs. If you win 5 you get a pack! lose 2 and you are out. Statistically this isn't right.
At the current state of the game no way do I recommend this game.

Artifact is a beautifully artistic creation. It has Many aspects going for it. The animations are impeccable and enjoyable. The combat is really cool and enticing. However it falls short in many ways. 

The biggest downfall of artifact has to be its lack of a F2P Model. The player can't invest time in order to earn rewards like more cards etc to create a sense of progression (I do believe they may have updated this I will update the review to reflect accordingly). You have to buy your way into the market place in order to have access to cards you dont have. You can argue that the secondary market is good for the game but it only benefits valve. They keep a % of a transaction as a fee for using the marketplace. Secondary issue is the RNG of the game creates a chance to lose by flipping a coin. No one likes bad RNG and this is an example of bad RNG. It will often decide the outcome of the game at the beginning.  Having access to only 4 colors kind of sucks, and not being able to cast cards unless you control a hero of that color. I think there should of been more colors introduced into the game tbh.

I'm kind of sad to see a valve game crumble and wither to nothingness. I do hope this game can bounce back someday.
This game is about to die. And there is a reason for it: The game is just not fun to play. It's too complex in a non fun way. The game has a interesting design, but it just doesn't add up to a game that gives you a good time.

Everything just feels like bullshit and there is no indication for the player that you have been outplayed. Well sometimes you are not even outplayed, your oponent just had that much RNG going for him and played a finisher card in round two. Deck building is crazy difficult, also because some cards are must haves and many are just garbage. Furthermore there are just way too many cards that just give +2 Attack. Yeah that might actually change the outcome of the game, but there is nothing more boring than seeing your damage going from 4 to 6 after you spend all your mana for that turn.


Just stay away until Valve makes major changes to the gameplay.
Absolutely no reason to play this game.

Each mode has major flaws with no overall objective or incentive to perform well or continue playing. The free Phantom Draft is so easily exploitable as each draft can immediately be scrapped and re-drafted until you have an unbeatable deck, this makes playing the 'casual' mode extremely frustrating and boring. The expert version of Phantom Draft requires entry tickets which are only obtainable through purchasing them, or sacrificing your collection of cards (20 cards for a ticket). This entry fee requires you to sacrifice any hope of constructed play without forking over additional cash. The constructed mode is a complete joke as to have any chance of winning you must invest tonnes of money to form a viable deck, with no progression (levels, ranks, MMR, anything). The gameplay becomes extremely stagnant as you verse player after player in the casual modes with more time and money than you, without any interaction at all (no emotes or forms of prestige). The playable decks featured in the Call to Arms arena only throw salt on the wound as they highlight the fun that could of been.  Bot matches have been the only form of real entertainment I've experienced from the game so far. Even if this game was free I would not recommend it in its current state. It is a damn shame I couldn't refund this monetization scheme of a game.

I do not understand why this game costs money at all and do hope Valve decides to change this disappointment of a new title as the core mechanics and gameplay are of high quality, but pale in comparison to the major issues.
When I played this in the beta, I was delighted. All I played was draft. If you're okay with playing casual draft for the rest of your life like I am, this game is great.

If you are literally anyone else this game will rip you a new one. Want to play with friends? Only constructed unless you play in a group, which isn't realistic having 4 people or more on consistently to do draft. Want to trade with friends? Not in the game (to avoid market scamming and stuff but c'mon now, there's ways to fix that). Want to collect? Get ready to pay out the ass one way or another. Want to play competitively? You have to pay every *single* time you play competitively in any game mode, some even more than others, unless you're a god with immense win rate that can make their money back every single time.

This game is wonderful. Richard Garfield designed a wonderful card game that is immensely fun. But goddamn, I got this game for *free* (from the Friends and Family pack) and I feel cheated still when it comes to literally everything except draft. The thought that they were considering not putting free draft in at all is appalling...

Rest In Peace 2008 Valve, We Loved You While We Could
I've played nearly every card game out there and Artifact has probably been my least fun experience out of all of them. Also, the monetization system is trash. Game is also near unwatchable for viewers which is another reason for me to avoid it as I like to stream my gameplay.
The game runs porly, and crashes, i tried to fix it tried to config video options, but 
idit didnt resolve, iam using lenovo y700 ideapad. And I cant get refund...
keep getting bong by those rich kids. and no way to earn new card without adding more money . game play is really nc but how i gonna play card game with just trush cards
Ok so i play the global matchmaking
pls explain how this works? im a lev 1
played vs a lev 7 ; 7 ; 5 ; 13 ;13  lol how am i suppose to win a game and level up what a joke
I am a hardcore dota 2 fan (Literally over 10,000 hours played and played other TCG like Shadowverse & Hearthstone.

It is really just so frustrating how Valve handled this game. It had so much potential to be the best TCG with how well crafted the game play is.  With solid graphics, strategic depth, great sound effects and unique elements thanks to Richard Garfield. However with all the ingrediants to make the perfect game Valve has just spat in everyones face for all who were anticipating Artifacts release.

Even with a brand new game Valve's strong stand on "Providing 0 communication" stands stronger then ever. It's like they don't even want their game to succeed. There are very obvious problems with the game some being not even hard to fix such as: no replays, no MMR, obviously overpowered cards that cost a fortune, connection issues, bad tutorial, challenges that encourage discovery/diverse gameplay.

The Artifact sub reddit is just filled with complaints about the game and Valves notorious stand of not giving a sh*t about the community that WANT this game to succeed. Even Panel members at Dota 2 events laugh about how this game is fail now and big community figures in other Digital Card Games that moved to support Artifact are jumping ship.

Don't buy this game or at the least just wait for it to be F2P which it surely will
A game totally about random - everybody writes about - you can make 40 card (minimum possible) deck - and on 11 mana you can't get your ultimate cards... and it's not one game - it repeats in every game. Don't buy this Random Sh*t! Don't spend money for game, don't spend money for cards - you can find a lot of games much better - and your ass won't be fired by facts you can't control... 3000 online isn't enough good reason? 
And also about boosters and complect draft - forget, you never get anything expensive - we played with 3 friends - nothing useful to get from draft/boosters - nothing that will help u win. Of course you can spend money for new PC - and get all these "IMBA" Annihilations and other trash - before they get fixed XD 
Final: Artifact = same joke and fail like Fallout 76 or moblie Diabo :DDDD
It's just not very good. There's not much to say about Artifact other than that. 

On the one hand, it looks lovely (excepting the Greevils). On the other, well, you have the rest of it. Artifact feels too much like Magic: The Gathering, even with the three lanes, heroes and items. So much so that I often wondered why I wasn't playing MTG, even though it is a game I have not touched in years. Artifact itself isn't too hard to understand, although there is a steep learning curve, but it's just not fun or exciting to actually play. 

There's a few reasons for this. Balance feels all over the place, with certain heroes of certain colors being obvious choices when bulding a deck, and certain deck colors being better than others. Additionally, while the game has a nice aesthetic and UI, it's not actually fun to watch or look at. Cards bang into each other and vanish. Gameplay-wise, the game alternates between feeling too random and too rigid. But, for better or worse, Artifact does capture the many feelings one associates with the game it was based upon, Dota 2.

The elephant in the room is, of course, the microtransactions. I am glad I recieved this for free because I would not have been happy about paying full price for Artifact, especially given that the ten packs I recieved resulted in a less than inspiring selection of cards. This leads to another issue: there are no serious ways for a more casual player to acquire cards without paying money.

Now, you can wager your tickets for a chance to win card packs. However, this will likely result in the player being swept by people who have already paid money to create killer decks. If you are a dedicated, competitive, serious player, then this may not be a problem. But it feels like it's just a tactic to wring money out of more casual players, especially if your initial ten packs don't result in an adequate selection of cards.

Speaking as a more casual player with more hours in Dota 2 than I want to admit, Artifact is appealing but never becomes fun or exciting or rewarding. Ultimately, it looks like Valve should've put all of this time and effort into resuscitating Dota 2. Instead, they're shaking fans down for the spare change in their wallets. And I have a feeling Artifact will make a heap of money, even if only temporarily, before people realize that -- much like the path Dota 2 was dragged down -- Valve cares about the game only in so much as it makes them rich. What will Artifact's Diretide be, I wonder?
Bought it and sold all the cards for like a 90% soft refund.
Can't say I enjoy the randomization of intial hero placement so your guy can get utterly fucked if faced against an unga bunga beatstick hero and the game will spiral out of control.
I'm one of the guys who like Dota lore so all the voiced card descriptions that tell a story of the pack theme is really nice.
the game its awesome but u need to pay for every fucking shit u cant get cards or play any shit and the game dont explain you that u MUST not open your packs or u cant use yours fucking useless tickets 


ohhh and u cant ask for a refound
Nothing like a niche game for an audience that has better options. I can't even get into this game and bought it to support Valve, and even then the basic bots are better than me, and the base decks are trash. This game is not for anyone trying to casually play a card game, as far as I can tell. Super disappointed with this game, there's literally ZERO incentive to even pick it up if you're not gonna burn 1000s of hours into it, and frankly, there's better games to play, wtf Valve.
It blows me away that the company that came up with the financial model followed it up with this.  This is a fantastic card game that is shooting itself in the foot with the pay for everything model.  There is no viable way to buy this game and be able to slowly get card packs over time without paying valve eventually.  Paid keeper drafts are fine, the paid constructed decks are fine.  Where is the progression?  Where is a proper ranked mode?  This feels like launch Street Fighter V, bare bones.  Which is really unfortunate because a lot of developers obviously worked really hard on the core gameplay.
Artifact really does well in capturing the essence of the Dota2 universe into a card format. The heros all have wonderful voice interactions with other heros and even creeps to further immerse yourself into the story behind Artifact. The gameplay is most of the time phenomenal and after most losses leaves you in a reflective period where you can point out your own mistakes and how you could have played better and this part of Artifact feels much more rewarding than other card games because you do invest so much thought and time into each match and decision. 

However on the opposite end of this there are points of RNG that can be at times incredibly frustrating. When a hero or creep is deployed it drops an arrow to indicate what that creep or hero will be attacking and this for the most part is entirely random. There are small cases where you can influence the arrows whether it be through putting a creep in front of something or specific cards but for the most part these arrows and the RNG they add are the games biggest flaw. I have lost several games due to heros piling on the same creep causing me to lose upwards to 20 damage in a turn which is half an objective needed to win. In the same vein when your heros get deployed they fall onto the board in random locations which further removes your feeling of control over your decisions in games. This can lead to really awkward feelings of lines of gameplay that can either be a really strong play or just an incredibly terrible play. Additionally at the start of the game heros are placed randomly so if your opponent has a lot of strong heros designed to kill other heros (black/red) and you're playing some of the weaker hero with low damage and hp (blue) you can instantly feed your opponent 5-15 gold in the first round and limit your ability to play cards the following round just because of the RNG placement of heros. If I could change anything in Artifact it would be the arrows directing combat and the RNG of deploying creeps/heros. 

And finally card design. What's the point of designing so many heros when you have some that completely outclass others. It feels as if you play any Red or Green deck you have to autoinclude Axe or Drow because they are just so strong. I'm not complaining about the strengths of these 2 heros but more so to the fact of why can these 2 be so strong and other heros so weak. This game is designed around the heros and it feels incredibly bland when half of them can't even dream of being playable. They need to rebalance the heros to where if it has a strong body maybe a less powerful hero card and vice versa and if this cant be achieved then all heros should be impactful both on the board and in their hero spells as well. 

Axe for example is a 7/2/7 which means he kills most heros outright and dies to very minimal heros and takes no damage from creeps, he is undeniably broken in what he offers on board control compared to every other hero in the game. Then we look at his hero spell Berserkers Call which for 6 mana allows a blocked red hero to fight all the enemy neighbors potentially not only clearing 3 positions on a board but wiping entire lanes or outright killing multiple heros in 1 card. Axe is insane. 

Earthshaker in comparison is a 2/0/7 meaning he can't kill creeps, dies to most heros in red/black outright, has no armor to prevent any creep or hero damage and comes with a stun on a 4 turn cooldown which often can be unreliable based on the RNG of positioning listed above as like Axe's berserkers call it effects enemy neighbors. Earthshakers hero card is Echo Slam which deals damage to enemies equal to the amount of enemies in lane. When there is a huge board Echo Slam can be devastating and outright win games, but when there's 1-3 units it is nothing more than a feelsbadman. 

If a hero can't kill anything on the board and often times dies to most hero on hero engagements than the abilities on the hero or its hero card should offset this imbalance and many heros fail to do this quite like Axe or Drow who are always good no matter what because they offer constant value through their hero stats and cards. If this game is to succeed they need to bring the weaker heros power up to influence more creativity in hero choices. 

Last part of rant is a specific card in Cheating Death. It's an enhancement that states if a green allied hero is in this lane all allies have a 50% chance upon dying to live with 1hp instead. If there's any card that should just be removed from this game it is this card. I've had several games that felt so good and then the guy plays this card and it just becomes this RNG shitshow and in all just feels terrible to be on the receiving end of this card. Either nerf this card to be 10-20% chance or just get rid of it because I won't play this game until that card is gone. This card doesn't cheat death it cheats players of a good experience. 

TLDR: Good game needs mechanics and heros reworked and balanced to meet its full potential. And Cheating Death should be removed from the game.
The ultimate rng simulator.

Draft rng - You don't need skill to draft 2+ Luna or 2+ Ogre Magi or to get a bunch of good cards.

Creep rng - 3 lanes and you get 2 creep randomly every turn

Hero rng - You have a chance that your hero gets killed by one of the enemy hero, it's 50-50 
with Bounty Hunter tho, because sometimes he has 11 attack, sometimes 7.

Hero/Creep rng - First round is absolutely random, but later at least you can choose the lane for your heroes, but the placement in lane is also random

Arrow rng - Left/Forward/Right - 25%/50%/25%. Your heroes and creeps are randomly attacking an enemy in one of these directions. If you never lost a game because of this, then you just haven't played enough.

Item shop rng - You get 3 item offers. The left one is totally random from all the items the game has, except basic consumables. The mid one is random from your items. The right one is random consumable.

Then there is a bunch more rng - rng spells, rng summonings, cards like intimidation that has 50% chance to win or lose the game for you in a lot of end game situation and i guess i am forgetting and i didn't mention the basic card game rngs.


Update: 
The game is still garbage, and the last update was over a two month ago. The game is so dead you will face the same enemy multiple times and all the draft modes are infested with crazy decks, 'cus players can just make a new deck over and over again.  No change will save this game.
So today I met the same people with a whale deck thrice in a row, I guess the only people who stays are the whale. 

I'm thinking maybe now is the time for a casual like me to retire, at first, I still found people who are my peers, but now, everyone just crush me silly.

Don't give me BS about deck construction, cheap deck will have a hard time winning against expensive deck, no other way around it, and I don't want to spend anymore money than I have to.

I gave Artifact a good review before, and yes, the game itself is still fun, but the playerbase is non-existent now.

I'd still with play bots now and then just to kill time though.
There is too much RNG in this game. Some of the Cards are needed to succeed in Draft/Constructed. So to win you either need luck or you can pay for them and play Constructed. I'm more of a Draft player myself, because i thought it feels more balanced. Afterall the way a match plays is just too random for me. After 30min I feel like i lost my time for nothing.

It's frustraiting - waiting for changes like chat and challanges, and till then I'm only playing with my friends because otherwise the game feels empty.
Artifact is a great game for someone who loves card games. It's very strategic and the fact that you actually have 3 gameboards gives the game a lot of depth. With that being said, I cannot recommend Artifact in it's current state. Valve has put way too much faith into their steam market and their economy for this game. It's a cool system to buy and sell cards don't get me wrong. But as of right now, this is the only way to obtain cards, next to just buying packs of course. So the only way to get cards AFTER the initial price tag of 18 dollars, is to put more money into the game...really Valve? The game also lacks any sort of progression, I don't know why they don't have a leveling system or even a simple daily-login system. You know, to keep the player engaged and let the player return to the game every once in a while. The fact that this game doesn't have any sort of progression system makes this game very stale and after you've kind of tried all of the different ''color'' decks...the game gets boring. You've seen it all. There aren't that many cards either atm, but they're probably going to make expansions so that should be fixed in time automatically. IF Valve decides to get rid of this weird and pretty greedy system and makes a progression system, then I'd say, buy it, you'll love it. But as of right now...big no no
TL:DR?
Pros:
+ Solid Gameplay
+ Great visual direction
+ Deep with moderately high learning curve

Cons:
- Slight imbalance in colours/heroes
- Lack of content
- No incentive to grind (No rank ladder or Achievements)
- Lack of features (No replay/In game stats and profiles)
- No thought into the updates


Well, this is my second attempt at writing a review for this title. Let me start by praising the work they've accomplished so far with it. It has SO MUCH potential it's not even funny.. It's a shame to sit here and write that, although fun when rng is on your side, the game is horrifyingly frustrating. Some call it complex and it is to some degree, but it's not exactly that complicated to play Phantom Assassin or Brisetleback on the flop and win the entire lane cause she/he 1 shots 90% of the cast. And there's a few instances of things happening like this.. Ogre Magi and multi cast, bounty hunter and jinada. I just find mechanics like this utterly game breaking and defeating although I'm sure one of you will say "Git gud!"

I bought into Artifact at launch before the Cheating Death fixes and first big CtA update. Looking back in retorspect It was nothing on the scale of what was to come to the forefront from those nerfs. We have Mono Blue and Red/Green ramp now over running the game and sapping any kind of enjoyment "I" (Me; personally) was having with the game. I find it so fricking hard to come back or win a game against either of these decks/heroes. So whether  I'm using Green/Black (Death and Taxes, I'm looking at you.. Essentially the worst combo of colors in the game so far. They really need to redo this deck. It's utter garbage compared to the other pre mades) or any other setup I've used unless I take a PA, gank and all the other seemingly imbalanced, underhanded and overpowered cards at our disposal. I just feel like the only way to get a win is to cheese your opponent (RN'CHEEZUS'). Probably why people say when they get a win it feels like an empty one. It's easily done too with blues constant wave clear which is hard af to outplay (Eclipse, Mystic Flare, Thundergods Wrath, 3 Ignites, Conflag, Thunderstorm... Am I missing something? Oh yeah, ANNIHILATE) This is just my opinion though and you might find it easier or more enjoyable.Another thing I didn't like was the adjustments to items. I suppose it was to try and level the playing field and help those what have bad flops back into the game.. This is counter intuitive. If you lose the flop (guarantee if your luck is as bad as mine thats at least %60 of the time) then your opponent is gonna snow ball and item spam you to death. Why would you adjust the item prices like that? If anything they should be more expensive and not cheaper as to make them more of a luxury rather than getting big items for a fraction of your gold reserves. They actually nailed the coffin with that last update. 

Another thing what gets me after so many weeks of playing is..... This game has literally ZERO content. No leaderborads, no achievements and no rewards (kind of sorted that one with the second update) Yes we found out through data mining and other sources that there's some development going on for a single player campaign and puzzle mode but really and truly, this should have been included already with the 20 initial fee. Not just access to draft (And remember people had to complain for them to make phantom draft free). I think this is just one of the main reasons they took a big hit in the player base. The game feels like its still in alpha/beta. 

Still a hell of a long way to go in the sense of balancing the cards and colours  and now items!!!!  Like I said, green/black is technically the worst combo at the moment, I feel. In a few months (Or years at this rate) I'd love to delete my review again and tell you how they've implemented a lot of mechanics which don't feel like day light robbery to play against and how amazing the game is to play after so many modes get added. For now though you're probably better keeping your eyes open for the updates and take it from there. 

PS: Just like to say... Shame on the people involved in the beta for this game. Wtf were you actually doing apart from circle jerking, investing in axecoin and leaving the game in the broken state it is so you could win a share in the 1,000,000 prize fund easier cause you were sat on tech?
You better have RNGesus on your side if you want to enjoy this, because boy is it random and that's ignoring the inherent randomness that comes with card draw. It is so absurdly random even Heartstone doesn't come close to it when it was it's worst. Here are some factors that might randomly decide the the game, with (approximately) descending influence on the game:

-Unit placement at the start. Enemy red brawler hero got placed against your squishy blue hero? You're now at a massive disadvantage right from the get go.
-Unit placement after the start. You really want your high-damage hero to attack another hero after being spawned in the lane? Too bad, he's hitting a creep for the next 3 turns.
-Attack directions. Oh hey look, that hero that has nothing in front of it this turn decided to attack to the left, killing your hero there.
-Items in the item shop, especially consumables. Really need that health potion or teleport scroll? Too bad, have some card draw potions.
-Creep spawns. Your creeps keep getting sent to the lane you don't need them to be in. 
-Items, cards and skill with plethora of unpredictability, such as: randomly split damage, random chance to disarm, random change to stun, random chance to draw a card after using a card, randomly place a unit with a random attack direction, random chance to lock your cards, random chance to deal damage to your tower.

And I'm not even mentioning the monetization models which has been (evidently) thoroughly explained in other reviews here.  It's a bad card game, save your time and go play something better.
what a waste of my money for buy packs and become shit cards, with this cards i cant build any deck vs other players and if you play vs p2w players, 0 chance with trash cards
Unfortunately, the game is pay to win and pay to play. Many essential cards are locked behind exhorbitant pay walls. It is not even a case that stronger cards are paywalled. Core cards of many decks are paywalled and you cannot even get a remotely competitive deck without these cards.
I actually very much enjoy this game.  I have played it for hours and I have a blast playing against my friends, talking about what deck combos are the best, talking about ways to improve reviews on the game, and most importantly talking shit when we beat each other in 1v1's or our tournament.

I enjoy the gameplay aspect of the board and how the game plays out very much.  It works.  It makes the game unique from other TCG and i love that.  I've play Hearthstone for a long time, alone with Magic and this game actually puts a smile on my face and makes me think about what I'm doing before I do it rather than aimlessly throwing cards on the board because they look cool.  The game forces a playstyle that requires you to forge your own decks and not look at ones online.  It forces and encourages you to try out different comps of heros, or cards, or items.  Just like in real Dota, every comp can get you a win, it's just how you build your heroes and how you play the game.  

What I don't enjoy is that you can tell the game was made to make money.  Made to make microtransactions happen.   Thing with Hearthstone doing buyable card packs is that Hearthstone is initally a free to play game.  You can play the game entirely for free.  You can climb the ladder, build decks, play in the arena, and even do some of the story for free.  A FREE TO PLAY GAME, giving content to players who don't want to pay money because they want to play causally, who don't care about what cards you have or how good you are.  They just enjoy the atmosphere of the game. 

That is what Artifact lacks.  HEAVILY.  This game has no free way of getting card packs other than when you recieve your first 10 when you start the game.  You get that and 5 event tickets.  Event tickets are basically a paywall to getting more packs.   People say that this game is shit, because you already paid $20.00 to play it, then on top of that you have to pay another $20 for 10 more card packs, don't let me forget to mention that they more card packs you buy, there is no discount.  You pay the same amount.  That is $40 spend on the game when you can go play a F2P card game that will allow you to play for free and earn card packs.  That is bullshit.   I feel people would love this game more if they gave a way to earn card packs.  Don't give the packs to us.  Make us play the game to get them.  I want to be rewarded for winning.  I want to have something to look forward too.  And I sure as hell don't want to buy a fucking "Event Pass" to feel the sense of accomplishment that I am getting better at the game.  Give us levels.  Give us ranks. Give us free tournaments.  Give us a game that we can play and not have to spend hundreds of dollars on to enjoy it.  Give us a game that isn't a cash grab for once.  Valve used to be ran by gamers.  Now it's ran by money hungry people who don't care about playerbase anymore.  Who don't care that their game is fun and enjoyable.

I don't care that you can buy packs.  That's not the point.  The point is that there should be a way to earn the packs rather than be forced to spend your money on a game that you BOUGHT.  It's bullshit and unacceptable.  No wonder the reviews are so low.
I'm marking my review as a 'No' but it's really more of a 'Mixed' review. This review comes in two parts: gameplay and my experience setting up/playing the game.

The actual game is fun. Its complex, deep, and rewarding. I see many people complaining about the 'pay to win' aspects of the game and while I agree to a degree, there is plenty to do that won't cost you a penny more than the base cost of the game. You get draft and prebuilt-constructed modes that always allow the game to be fair. Plus, buying/selling singles is something that you don't get in many electronic TCG games. 

Now to my experience. I understand that my setup(s) aren't typical. I'm mainly a Linux user and I have a laptop and desktop (desktop dual-boots, laptop is pure Linux). On my desktop, I don't have many issues running the game. I have hardware that supports Vulkan, but there are some weird texture/artifacting issues that I don't see in other games. It took some work to setup, but I eventually got it working. My laptop is a different story. It has older hardware (although hardware from 2012 shouldn't be defunct) and doesn't support Vulkan. Ok that's fine, I'll run Artficat using OpenGL, except I get a black screen whenever I do that. So I can't play this game on my laptop at all.

So, yes I recommend this game if you're on Windows with newer hardware, but otherwise maybe wait for Valve to patch and fix some core technical issues.
I am not sure if I can call it a gimmicky or a differently detailed/thought card game. But, the thing is that Artifact is not a stream friendly game. It is hard to watch and hard to adapt to someone's else situation. 

I can't justify the starting price. In addition, I find the lack of daily rewards a heartless decision which, kind of, turns me off. You can't collect anything without extra purchases. Come on, guys, it is not a printed card game. Even the atrocities (mobile) have daily rewards. 

I can't recommend it in its current state.
Look, I think the game is fun, and i do understand microtransactions, i really do, and i even think its one of the better ways of monetizing a game, instead of adding DLC that will make you feel left out if you cant or wont buy it,
BUT the big problem with this game is that there is no way of obtaining new cards without spending money, yes you can win packs by using tickets and winning "competitive" games, but you also have to buy the tickets, win two games, and then you get 1 pack, meaning you lose money winning or even worse losing games.

I like the game, i think it's a creative take on a multiplayer card game, but once you reach the limits of the deck you can build (which i didn't reach) with the cards you randomly get when you fire up the game for the first time, you are basicly expected to pay even more money to continue enjoying the game by buying either packs or individual cards.

I want to recommend this game because its fun, but i cant, because i can't recommend a game when i know the limitations of the game's monetization method.
I would have loved to get into this game, but I don't. The pace, the mechanics are not cut for me.
My main problem: the pace is too slow. One lane would have been enough for me rather than 3. Buying extra cards between rounds slows the game further down. Yes, potentially that gives you extra strategy but the time cost for me is too high. I prefer faster paced games. Or maybe i'm too formatted with MtG?
Personally i didn't mind the economy model they decided on, however after playing for about an hour i  decided it wasn't for me and asked for a refund.
I have played Plenty of Hearthstone and Mtg aswell as Dota 2 so i had great anticipation for this game, but i just find it terribly boring and unsatisfying to play, maybe that will change with future expansions but i doubt it.
Been waiting for Artifact for quite a while. At first i had enjoyed the experience, but then it was seriously getting on my nerves. Believe me when i say this game IS PAY 2 WIN and VERY luck based. This is all a pity, as the gameplay idea is very nice and definetely works. 

The best thing about this game is the story of the war between legions from Dota 2, absolutely amazing lore. I didn't think i should go thus far to write a negative review, but COME ON! I bought this game for 17.95 eur like everyone else, and then i have to buy a deck which is suitable enough to go up against others? or if i want to play expert play, 4.50 for a fucking ticket? Is this actually serious?

For people who can afford this kind of shit, their experience whilst playing this game will be great. Otherwise if you arent ready to pay around 60 eur extra to get a really good deck... just dont.

Personally i'll only be playing this game against bots, since i don't want my 17.95 eur to go to waste. Oh and yes, one last thing. if you plan on refunding the game. dont use your first 5 tickets for expert play, or you won't get it.

To those who will continue playing the game, i hope you have fun!

PS: If certain things will change, for example, being able to earn card drops and not needing to buy them. I will happily give this game a thumbs up :)
Pros:
- Great gameplay.
- There are many RNG factros, but the game still feels that you have control.
- High skill ceiling.

Cons:
- [strike] Lack of progression, some skin rewards or at least something could be nice. [/strike] 
- On my Mac 2017, the game constatly crashes when you alt + tab.
- Some UI bugs
- [strike] There are strong cards and week cards which is normal... and there is "Cheating Death" card which is 50-50 for every minion in that lane to survice a fatal blow. The purpose of this card is to counter board wipes like "Annihilation". The card itself is not that broken you can play around it, but the feeling that you won or lost because of this card is really bad. I am certain then you could think of a better card that is countering the wipes than this. [/strike] 
- Why I can't play draft with a friend... This can be fixed by lowering the min tournament players to 2 people or just a direct challenge.
- The tournament finder could be improved
- TCG - but you can't trade with friends
- There is no profile or statics
- [strike] With this pricing model I don't see how it's possible to nerf/buff cards and don't make someone angry [/strike]

Overall:
Gameplay is great, but there are many more const that stack up. Probably in the feature they will fix most of the problems, so I can revisit the review to make it positive.

EDIT: In "Patch 1.2" many negative aspects are covered. I think this is how this game should have been released. I am sure that after a few more patches this review will be positve.

EDIT: In "Patch 1/10" now you can't even play the game on Mac
Get nothing for pre-purchased, paid 20$ for trash starter cards(you have to pay alot to get top tier decks-these overwhelming contructed match), supposed to face RNG at start of every single round, no time for this game, TOO LATE FOR REFUNDING :(
I'm going to try something different and write a negative review that doesn't relate to pay2win. It's a CCG, so that doesn't bother me -- I'd happily pay to play a good one with interesting, fun mechanics and a long-lasting, dynamic and meaningful economy. Artifact, sadly, has none of these things.

99% of cards (for now, at least) relate to some combination of +/- damage and health. There are exceptionally few interesting or novel mechanics in play, with many of the genre staples having been left out (presumably to make the game feel different), and many of the interesting interplays between them left out too.

Add +1 health and +1 armor to your 8 health guy so that the 9 damage guy attacking him doesn't kill him this turn. Add 1 armor and 1 damage to the guys next to your guy. Meanwhile, your opponent is doing exactly the same kind of thing, nullifying each other’s plays more often than not. It's exactly as boring as it sounds. 

You also don't manipulate the cards on the play area and battles happen more or less automatically, with a little (fairly unwelcome) RNG thrown in to control the direction of attack. This removes a lot of decision making and agency and feeling of involvement that you get in other card games.

The whole thing ends up feeling over-thought, and playing it feels pedestrian and spreadsheet-like. No amount of fancy attack animations can overcome how dull your row of numbers hitting against their row numbers feels. 

There's painfully few interesting trade-offs or decisions to be made from one turn to the next as you often only have a single sensible option at each interval. Winning ends up feeling like an unsatisfying battle of attrition as you gradually attempt to whittle down the opponent's numbers quicker than he whittles down yours, hoping for RNG to be kinder to you along the way.

All the things that sounded good on paper, like the 3 lanes, and the inclusion of a shop, the placement of hero cards etc. don’t actually make the game any more fun. They just exacerbate the issue: you have 3 boring fights going on instead of 1, and the whole match is drawn out to lengths of 40mins+.

If there is any depth, Artifact is not nearly interesting enough to warrant the exploration necessary to find it. Note that the few positive reviews that do exist and that say the game is 'deep' never actually go on to qualify this statement or give any examples.

And in a somewhat devious move by Valve, as the game's developer and Steam platform holder: once you open the packs you get with the game you can't refund it. Please consider this negative review - something I've rarely made the effort to do in 15 years of using Steam - me returning the favour.
The game is good, I would give it a positive rating itself, but the comercial model is too much capitalist. You pay 20 bucks for the game, but you can't be happy playing it just with initial cards, becouse you will face some expensive decks that will crush you full of rare cards, and you will want to buy some cards (the game don't give you a single pack). Until here, no problem, but the true abuse is the market fee and dont allowing we to just trade cards by cards. If Valve claim that is using the MTG paper system, trade card by card is a pillar of the system. So Valve, remove the Artifact Fee from the market and reduce the market's fee.
This is the game that made me realize, that I love all the psychological tricks, gacha and f2p games use on us. You can repeat "you play for the fun, not for some reward" all you want, progression and rewards ARE fun, at least for a big enough amount of potential customers. The game itself is quite good, but that may be only my impression, because its at least a different concept. 

3/10 not engaging enough to "just play for fun"
The only reward you get in this game is the pleasure of defeating your enemy.
Wan't to do that? Insert CC in valve ATM.

Deep down i was hoping this game would go Dota2 way - where smart play is rewarded and fancy cosmetics for $ are available.
Core gameplay foundation is strong but the econonmy is ****ed. "That's how card games have always been," or "it's reasonable compared to Magic" is a rediculous argument. This is 2018 from freaking Valve no less. Expect better. Demand better.
Artifact is good on many levels, but heavily plagued not by the monetization, but by the lack of ways to earn stuff and increase your card pool without spending money.

If you don't have a lot of money to spend, then this isn't a game I would recommend to anyone. The only thing you can really do with the buy-in is to play Casual Phantom Draft which gets you no rewards. If you do have money, then you really won't have any problems playing video games no matter how expensive they are.

While other card games like Hearthstone are technically more expensive if you pay with money, they have NO $20 BUY-IN and you can still earn packs for free and play Arena to get rewards. Artifact on the other hand asks you to pay $20 just so you could play a game mode or two without any rewards. The 'Expert' game modes require you to have a decent card pool (which requires, you guessed it, money!) or tickets (guess again, money!).

It's a terrible system and Valve has to fix it ASAP and add a way to earn card packs and tickets without spending actual money on the game. 

At the time of posting this review, I cannot recommend this game to players who don't have a big wallet.
Artifact is a lot of fun, yet the scammy refund policy and the ever-present monetization is a big NO. 
I dont mind paying for stuff, I mind when the game low-key forces me to. Won´t touch it again.
Competitve play locked behind pay-wall

No progression system

No rewards for playing 

No incentive to get better or to win / lose

No thanks! Change or dead game.
No progression in f2p terms, in a title you have to pay just to play.
Some cards are simply direct upgrades of each other, treant is a green card that gives surrounding allies 2 armor, with 12 hit points, the Satyr shaman or whatever the fuck he's called is also a green hero card but only gives 1 armor and also has 2 less hit points than treant. They're both in the exact same card category and color, so if you're lucky you'll get the better cards in your opening packs or you can just dish out that cash. 
It has no quests, nothing to make you earn packs, except to spend tickets to enter the gauntlet, which eventually you'll run out of or lose very quickly due to the misfortune you might have had in the initial cards you got.
The market and all that seems like a great idea to me, it makes it feel so much more like a real card game and the gameplay is interesting, intense and very fun, with lots of rng and a need to be able to adapt to diferent circumstances instead of just spamming the same strategy in every game.
Unfortunately my funds are limited and whilst i do enjoy the game, i cannot support a non f2p game to have this kind of deep monetisation and pay to play or better, "play to progress" kind of structure.
Payment method aside.

The game isn't that great. Everything is RNG, it's just made to look like it isn't, creep positioning, attack direction, shop items, cards effects. You cannot reliably call a game with so much RNG competitive, you could play the same match 5 times a day for a year and have no clear winner. 

The design is beautiful, the cards are meh. Each deck is forced 5 heroes, you can't have multiple so ofc their will always be meta heroes, setting up strategies is more based on setting up mini strategies playing around a couple of your heroes or around a certain mechanic around color (4 color types so far) 

Hearthstone just does it all better and i'm not really a hearthstone fan anymore.

I doubt we'll see this game in the TCG big leagues no doubt valve will make money but that's about it.
Way too many random elements on top of a card game.  I really dislike the random attack directions and initial placement of heroes.  Who the heck thought that was a good idea.
a great lesson to all developers out there on how a game shouldn't be like. 20$ buy in, another 1$ dollar each time you want to play the competitive modes (yes, free modes are meaninglessly low effort and casual.) and let's not forget you also have to buy all the cars which were about 150 dollars for all but they are 90 dollars now because everyone quit the game. Those were 3 pay walls i listed and the game does not have a ranked mode or any sorts of progression, lmao i just can not believe this game was being developed for more than 4 years, the first thing this game needs is a new lead designer who actually knows whe he is doing.
Honestly really fun, unique, and engaging game. Simple enough to learn, difficult to master, and very rewarding to improve at. It rewards skill and gives you as a player agency, and very rarely does there feel like a blowout occurs. Unlike in other card games, your opponent won't discover a ridiculous answer, you won't get land locked or flooded, and your opponent can't FTK you because you weren't good enough to draw hand traps, and your wins and losses feel like your own. This card game is truly dota incarnate.

However!
After a while the game feels unrewarding to play. You can only draft B/G/X so many times before it loses its luster, especially that there is no progression. It feels very, very bad to win twice and still recieve nothing from a draft, and to only recieve two packs with $0.20 rares in each of them when you manage to go undefeated. You have no means of knowing if you're bad at the game or great or average.

Additionally, rares make the game unfun. Playing against an axe or drow in draft simply doesn't feel good when you had to run 3 basic heros, *especially* when a ticket is on the line. Doing well in a constructed match, only to get a lane brutally reversed on you from a time of triumph or annihilation or cheating death simply doesn't feel good. Nor does getting run down by a turn one Mist or Oath (especially within Draft). All of these non-situational 1 for X cards simply feel like bad design within the context of laning and resource management.

If you wish to have something fun to play occasionally with a group of friends you do not live near, or you wish for a breath of fresh air, I recommend this game. However, if you're looking for something you can sink your time and/or money into and be rewarded for, or something that you can spend hours on with friends, or something casual and relaxing and easy to play, I recommend Dota2, or a local card store, or a boardgame.
It is a well designed card game. Lets say market place is not a issue ok. It costs 20$. We bought it as a finished product yeah?
Then why the F this Sht crashes all the time during game?
Dota 2 reborn was the same story, but I forgive that because its Fing free, they took years to fix the bugs there regardles. 
Just let me play without  Fing crashing the Sht out of this Pice of Sht game. Fix your Fing sht please volvoooooooo.
Crashes every turn aaaaa reconnect, relaunch aaaaaaa.
I'm unable to play the game. I played through the tutorial barely with lots of lag and graphics blacking out. I changed all settings to the lowest that are available. I join a phantom draft. I go to build my deck and every single time it freezes while I'm adding cards to my deck. I'm unable to play. I know my computer sucks but I have it on the lowest settings and it runs smooth  until it decides to freeze up. Any help would be appreciated. I have been searching but can not find any relevant information to help me.
It was fun for a little while.


After 18 hours I feel like there's nothing left in the game to play towards, no stats, no achievements, no leader boards or progression of any kind, nothing. Every game is the same. So I feel like I have had the full experience of Artifact and there's nothing I would be missing out on if I just stopped playing now.


The game is very well balanced, but the game mode that is free to play, will have you run into people who have spent all the money to buy the best cards to get a deck that you won't beat, ever. Or you will be one of these people and decide there's really no point in changing anything up, you play the same game every time hoping to run into someone to make it interesting. The better and more fair game modes are the ones like Kepper's draft. Unfortunately that costs the equivilant of a meal to play each set, so not something I can continue playing just to have more interesting games.



Overall the game is a lot of fun for a few hours, and has a lot of potential moving forward as long as Valve updates the game and adds more for the community, but as it currently is right now, I would recommend not buying the game. Just wait until it gets better, if it does.
When I first spent a couple of hours with Artifact drafting, building decks, playing, winning and losing, I didn't enjoy it. I normally really like card games.  

At first I was hopeful that the fun was hiding a layer or two below the surface.  Artifact has a relatively complex layout and turn sequence, and within that familiar complexity is this mystery: If I wanted the MOBA experience, why wouldn't I just play a MOBA instead? This card game simulation of a MOBA is less exciting to play than either a MOBA or other digital card game not based on a MOBA. 

After playing several more drafts, unfortunately Artifact is just not very interesting. There are two glaring problems with game mechanics. 

The biggest turn-off is that the random placement of creeps and heroes at the beginning of each turn is way too much RNG for a game where placement can make or break you.  

The second biggest issue is that no spells can be played unless you have the right color hero in the right lane, and this makes for frequent and severe restrictions on card playability.  Losing a hero for a turn or two has all the fun of getting locked out of your own house, and unfortunately this is a core element of the game strategy.  It is like two people trying to lock each other out.  The effect is nearly identical to mana screw in magic but it can happen suddenly and at any time, even in late game, and when it happens can often lead to snowbally wins.  

In draft mode, which is what you will mostly be playing, this game feels very random and unbalanced, and I don't recommend it.
So you can play a couple of games for free in competetive modes, then you gotta pay up. In constructed you only find people who payed more. And this might be cause I'm not good but shadow mode for tickets seems like it comes down to which heros you got offered most of the games rather than skill. Those with cards attached that completely flip a lane will usually win. If you play the free modes, people will not finish their games if they think they'll lose, so it's fucking boring. I think this is a game they pushed really hard by buying off all the streamers and youtubers and I think it sucks. And thats worst of all, I didn't have any fun playing it, none, that doesn't happen very offten.

Love DotA 2 btw. Played Hearthstone Legendary mostly arena though. Playing Gwent still.
This review is for playing Artifact without spending any moneym aka what you get for free.

Pre-constructed Call to Arms gauntlet: Boring. Deck with time of triumph is superior to all and I won vs any opponent except some that played same deck. All in all gets old quick.

Phantom draft: If you get bad luck with the draft and do not get proper win condition cards its very hard to win. Also opponent seem to play with better decks, guess this is because its easier to abandon the draft and start a new after lockout period than waste time with suboptimal one.

General: Seems every opponent is milking the clock. Since its TCG and is designed for people to spend money balance is bad.
Had beta access from TI, still wouldn't recommend the game. Valve was made fully aware of the imbalance of some cards being broken. Certain cards, such as Mists of Avernus and The Oath, will instantly win the game if played on turn 1.

People are currently in a honeymoon phase as it just came out. They'll very soon realize how broken this game is.
First time i ever write a review for a game, but for Artifact i had to.

Gameplay wise this game is great, the mechanics are good and i did not experience any bugs in my short playtime so far.
For the price of the game you get 2 decks, 10 packs and 5 tickets which also is fair and i have no complaints there.

Now the real problem is in the way the game allows you to earn packs.
There are 4 game modes currently and only 1 mode gives rewards.

So i will focus on that mode as it is the most relevant to me.

To play constructed and phantom draft you need to pay 1 ticket.
This roughly costs a little less than 1 euro for me.
Now you only earn rewards after 3 wins which is 1 ticket as reward.
After 4 wins you also get an extra pack and the 5th win gives you a total of 1 ticket and 2 packs.

4 wins to get 1 free pack is just stupid, i can buy a pack at 1,75 euro so why would i take the risk of playing expert and losing money.

The big problem is in keeper draft
to start a run of keeper draft where you can keep the cards you draft you have to pay 10.55 euro
This is because you need to pay 2 tickets and 5 packs.
The reward system is the same again with slightly higher rewards upto 2 tickets and 3 packs + the cards you drafted for 5 wins.
Again if i would lose the game before i reach 3 wins i basically payed 10.55 euro for 5 packs.

Why is this a thing, where i have to pay for the game and pay again to actually play it for rewards (which are very lackluster)

I understand that a online card game is gonna be payement heavy to some point but as a heartstone player this is just mind blowing, i can play heartstone and earn free rewards even if its slow i can still earn them. In Artifact you cannot earn anything for free, you ALWAYS have to pay.
 
If they keep this system going i can assure you alot of people will quit this game before the end of december.
Either add some sort of in-game currency or add rewards to casual play where you dont have to pay to earn rewards.
Everyone's talking about microtransactions. Let's put that aside for a minute.

This game doesn't even have the most basic features of a multiplayer competitive game:
No profile tab. You can't see your matchmaking history, your favorite decks, your highest winrate cards, etc.
No replay functionality. You can't rewatch your last game to learn from your mistakes.
You can't chat with your opponent. Or use emotes. Or anything.
You can't add your opponent to your friends list to talk to him/her after the game is over.
-No card emotes/taunts.
-No post-game statistics.
-No ingame leaderboards.
-No ingame MMR statistics.
-No ranking.
-No experience/level progression.
(As a matter of fact, sometimes i feel like i'm playing a single player game. Since there is NO INTERACTION WHATSOEVER with the other player, for all I know valve might be testing their new dota open AI, or whatever the hell it's called, and I wouldn't be able to spot the difference.)

P.s: 10k online is rly UGLY for VOLVO game.
P.s.s: VOOLVO GIVE DIRETIDE!
Don't buy until they figure which direction they want to go with there monetisation right now it's a cash grab you can't play competitive without injecting money in the game.
This game is a really fun card game, it really is. But the random placement of creeps/hero WITH the random lane arrows on top of that, really made this game unfun for me.

I really want to like it and play it,but the random arrows and random card placement are a deal breaker.
The game itself is fun to play and constructing decks is fun. The main issue with the game is that there is no free way to earn new cards. There is no insentive for me as a player to actually continue playing the game. There is nothing for me to progress towards. No ranking system, no system to earn cards/decks via gameplay (without having to pay). Yes there are tickets to play where you can earn decks but once you run out of tickets, there is nothing I can do as a player to earn more cards or any form of ranking. 

It is one of those games that's fun to play for a couple of hours because it's new. But there is no incetive for me to come back to this game and play more. If it was designed with that in mind, that there will not be any progression, then fine. That's the design by choice. But if you're coming to Artifact looking for a competative expirience, best to save your money and invest in another game.
Had to change my review from recommend to do not recommend. I disagree with everyone whining about the pay to play aspect though, and here's why:
You pay 20 dollars for the game, that covers the 10 starting packs it gives you. It is enough where if you absolutely don't want to spend money on the game you COULD get good and earn cards through expert drafts, it would just be skill based. You can buy the entry tickets by recyling commons, so they are between 20-40 cents. If the card values are high you can make money doing keeper drafts. I suppose if valve wanted to, they could create a ftp version that still gave people access to the free drafts, but other than that its a card game where cards have value, giving away too many for free would ruin the market and it's one of the things I like about the game. There are plenty of online card games where you cannot buy cards.

Pros:
-beatiful game, runs smoothly
-card market makes building the exact deck you want possible, and means the money you put into the game isn't gone forever if you so choose
-a happy middle ground between MTG and hearthstone, good for streaming/casual play

Cons:
-no ranked ladder and thus no real incentive to keep playing
-RNG that makes me absolutely want to uninstall the game (cannot choose hero placement in lane, attack targets chosen randomly, cheating death mechanic, cannot mulligan starting hand or cards. for a game that wants to be strategy based this just ruins everything)
-a UI that could use some optimization (market prices aren't accurate, game spectating isn't client side, it's through steam and awful to use. viewing cards could be optimized, would be nice to see a number owned, I feel like this whole part could be re-worked)

Overall Valve really let us down with this one, and they will need to make some changes quickly to save their game. It is a great game and I hope they step up so I can badger the rest of my friends into buying it.
Even though I just played 8 hours, I would like to post my first impressions for the game. I will update my review another time.
First of all the positive things: 
- new concept with playing on 3 lanes offering stretegic depth
- different approaches to win the game
- nice animations
- good timer system so people don't take ages every time to take their turns

Summary: The game offers nice tactical depth, careful considerations of you plays often lead to victory or loss. It feels completely fresh and I like the general design of the game. The problem are the negative points, which are in my opinion very frustrating and lead to a negative feedback:
- not only card draw RNG decides about winning or losing, but also RNG like the minion and hero placement, their attack directions and the RNG on the cards theirself. And this is the biggest problem of the game in my opinion and probably the reason why I won't stick to the game. Draw RNG is normally sufficient in cardgames. If you add more RNG like in this game, which can determine who will lose or win, then thats very very bad for a game and leads to very frustrating moments. In my opinion, the RNG element is even bigger than in Hearthstone. The minions are placed randomly on the lines, lot of cards have a probability of 50% to trigger and the attack directions (left , right, straight forward) are random. This is absolutely horrible and not needed. Sure it will win you games, but it also will lose you games. I have no idea why a company would think that such a concept is fun. It completely extinguishes the competitive spirit of a game and -atleast for myself- ruins the fun
- probably the greediest economy I have ever seen. You have no quests or no free way to get new cards. You have either to buy tickets (or well, win above average) to get new packs or cards or you simply have to buy the cards. There is no way to get new cards as a f2p player. In the end you have to pay if you don't want to stick with just casual formats. This absolutely shouldn't be the case
-the cards are pretty imbalanced. There are effects in my opinion that are simply too strong and should get rebalancedm which will probably not happen since you buy the cards

Summary: Overall, the negative aspects of the game are that grievous that I will probably stop playing the game and stick to Magic. If you like losing games to RNG and you don't mind spending money to buy a deck, then this game could be something for you. But in my opinion, the game in its current state is horrible and unplayable and such a economy should not be supported. This is especially sad, since the ideas of the game are pretty good and refreshing.
DON'T EVEN TRY THE GAME!!! 
I've tried the game at launch and found single matches are too long for my taste. After finishing two bot games, I opened the starter pack just to check what I got, compared to the bot games. I didn't even play a real match or build a deck for that matter. But when I tried refunding the game, I was denied because I opened the starter pack.

It's very cynical of Valve for forcing the refund on indie developers but cheating the system themselves. So if you're unsure of trying the game, beware that you will sink 20$ on a non refundable game in a genre full of free to play alternatives.
Still has a long way to go. Might be ok in a few patches when some progression, social and just overall fun elements have been added to bare-bones base game. Monetization feels out of place and discouraging.

Free phantom draft is a good start, I suppose.
As it stands now, the game doesnt offer you enough. 
Limited card pool
Pay2Pay Model
No Progression System

I hope it gets better in the future but this is not worth it right now.
Gameplay is just meh.... Games take forever and are mostly luck based. there is no form of progression implemented and you have to buy cards with real money
All you need to do is spend some money, everything is gonna be OK. Spend for "purchase" so it can be in your library, spend for cards so you can play, spend for tickets so you can play Ranked. Every step you make is Money Money Money
Not only does this game cost money, but it also forces you to pay to play competitively unless you are good at the game. You don't get anything for playing casually. No cards, no system to earn the packs like Hearthstone does. This is a pay to progress game if you're just an average player. It's full of people who have just payed for all the cards and are now dominating every game with their near perfect decks. I would not recommend this at all. The actual gameplay is okay but no matter how consistent you try to make your deck, there are so many chance variables that whether you win a game or not is all based on the off chance a creep goes exactly where you need them to. This game needs a serious rework before I would ever give it a good review.
A good fusion of the RNG (in a good way) and visual feedback of Hearthstone and the strategy and depth of MTG without being too overwhelming, all wrapped in a satisfying DOTA flavor. It feels polished and responsive, and I typically wouldn't hestitate recommending this to anyone, but the business model is greedy as sin and really disgusting coming from such a reputable developer and publisher. It pushes further an already cancerous culture of overmonitization and greed. I would have much rather had this come out as full price with a full set, but unfortunately Valve seems to have taken the worst possible route for this and will very likely not be good for its longevity and reception. I love the game, but I find this beyond disappointing and definitely won't be going out of my way to support it as a result.
This game crashes constantly, I have lost an event ticket simply due to the crashes. Nothing I have found has helped, avoid buying until the crashes are fixed.
Update 11/29 Still crashing, cannot play a single game fully without a crash.
if you love DotA you must buy it , and valve i want to play artifact in dota or build my deck in there make them more connected I DONT WANT A 2 SEPARATE GAMES , I WANT A MASTER PEACE JUST LIKE DOTA IS
so many great ideas so little time  connect the game to DotA   like DotA plus works in dota and artifact both  or u can win card or buy card with battlecup or shards   poor example of what i have in mind but im not get money for it , so in short if u sell this game at least work very hard for it
Arfitact is an enjoyable card game, with fresh action and depth. However, the monetization scheme is hard nosed and you will be forced to put money down for the competative scene. I would like to see more weekly or daily challanges that would allow  players to earn packs or tickets. I understand that the whales will deeply enjoy this game, but the casuals will not hold up. If your not at least familer with the principals of CCG/TCG games then you will bounce off this. Each game is much more involved than other popular card games. 

[i]I enjoy the depth and vigor this game shows, but the casual player is likely to bounce, and their is no way to earn cards with out spending money.

TL;DR It's a good game, but costs more if your serious about it.
Oh my god....This game is horrible, you can't get any value and benefit in one game, you can't get gold or any experience in the game so you cannot buy the packs, and also you cannot craft or resolved the cards, you must use money to buy the cards or the packs what you want, so fxxking disgusting!
Imagine playing three Hearthstone games at once, but you share one deck between all three boards and the RNG is somehow even more infuriating. And there's a cherry on top: the only way to get new cards is to buy them with cash money, there are no login bonuses and no rewards from winning. That's Artifact.

Artifact's aesthetic scheme is clean and easy on the eyes (a Valve staple, those folks know their color theory), and the sound effects and voice acting are of equally great quality, but Dota 2 as a setting is utterly boring and all that Valve love almost seems like wasted effort. The tutorial reveals that the game itself is intricate and has strategic depth—probably already equivalent to Hearthstone, which has years of expansions over Artifact—but that's a moot point, as this game's monetization system (in lieu of a progression system) prevents me from being competitive or doing anything other than the free draft mode. I have no desire to spend more money on this game than the $20 buy-in, which means it's not for me. It's really that simple, we don't even have to address how unfun the RNG in this game is.

Artifact certainly has potential, especially backed by a company like Valve, but in its current state it's basically pay to win—or worse, online gambling—and I can't support that. Know what you're getting into before you buy this game.
i now understand why they make you buy 10 packs before trying out the game

If like me you love dota 2 and love card games, dont expect to love artifact
Never got the promised packs, requested immediate refund. Valve makes a game after all those years and still manages to fuck it up. Brilliant isn't it?
Wait until this game dies and gets reworked before trying. It has good potential, but your experience in the current game will ruin any future experience you have in the game. The pay to play won't be a problem as the value in cards goes down to their realistic floor. The real problem is the lack of daily incentive to continue playing. The designers of this game have no sense of what makes a game addictive. It's current state has no addictive qualities. Let the game die so the developers can resurrect it into something better.
In general I like this game... but... progression system is non-existent. It has so much potential but due to the fact that there is no way to earn cards without spending actual cash, I would not recommend it.
As of the time of this review I cant reccommend Artifact. It is missing so many features that I can not stay interested for more than one game.  No ranked mode at all. No real progression system.  Certain cards are horribly unfun to play against where it boils down to a 50/50 coin toss to determine who will win that lane. It needs a lot of work before I would consider it worth $20.
I really had high hopes this would been good, turns out its pay to win
There is absolutley no way to get free cards (compare to hearthstone) by just keep playing
Its also so random based when it comes to combat between cards
And worst of all, IT YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR THE GAME!
** THIS IS WHY STEAM NEEDS A NEUTRAL REVIEW **

UPDATE: Crashes on Mojave every time you click collection.

I really like it so far. It doesn’t have the character that Hearrhstone has, but it’s good and I’m digging it so far.

The only problem is that this is Valve and you’d think they would know that a game with a purchase price being pay to win is a huge No-No.

I’ve seen quotes that it would be around $350 for a full deck of cards.

So while I like it and would recommend it if you go into it knowing this, I can't give it a thumbs up because there is no neutral review choice. Otherwise it would just add to the blind positive rating :(
I am not happy with the sale,mandemz almost got my money, I was lucky to sell my cards and get money back but they shouldn't give it at a discount after a few weeks. It looks desperate and unless theres compensation this isn't worth your time.
Pay to play and Pay to win all in 1 scammy little rip off of every other trading card based game ever made.

So you buy the game for 16 quid then you go through 2 tutorial matches, after that the game makes you open a pack... As soon as you have opened that first pack the game becomes non-refundable.

Don't buy this game unless you are prepared to spend up to the base price for the game for 1 card from the steam market, thats right 16 quid for 1 (single) card (fml).
 
pro's; Animated little dragons (woop)

con's; Pay to win.
          Non refundable after opening mandatory pack. 
          Playing across 3 boards becomes tedious very quickly.
          Card prices depend on steam market.
          No way to grind for cards/packs ingame.
          No story.
          
Other FREE options are, Hearthstone, MTG Arena.
Man i do not recommend this game at all. While it COULD be a great game.. Valve decided to be a bunch of arseheads and skrew it up. From how you can get.. im sorry how you can buy cards.. to gameplay mechanics that the community told them were trash but meh they want it to rot thats on them.
The problem with the game is, putting aside the financial aspect of the game, I'm just talkng about gameplay here, you don't feel involve in the games unit placement and the games decision, so a hero can die and you will have no power over it because you didn't choose where to place it + the cards you draw can be unplayable for 2 turns or have no use in the lane you need it, the equipments are bland and boring.....I felt more involved in Warstorm, if anyones know that game, I played all the card games, still play MTG (paper), hearthstone, slay the spire, Legends..., I wanted to love that game, but the truth is ...it's boring, I see the tactical options the games offers, but in the end I prefer a Sudoku or a crossword puzzle over this
The overall gameplay and mechanics are ingenious. For anyone familiar with DOTA or MOBAs in general, you instantly see the similarities. It genuinely feels as though you are managing 5 heroes across 3 lanes in a MOBA game.

However, as many other users have stated, the model does feel like pay to win for three reasons:

1. There is no progression in the game. This means that there is no way to earn new packsk or cards outside of spending real money on the market and events, which cost event tickets. 

2. You start with 10 card packs and 5 event tickets. This means whatever cards you get from these packs will be whatever you play with until you essentially spend more money. Event tickets can be crafted using 20 cards, but again cards are hard to come by without spending money. This will only get more irritating when they eventually release expansions.

3. The game costs $20.00 USD. I'm generally cautious about microtransactions. There is a large amount of faith that valve is asking you to put into their game. The faith the game will remain relevant, and the faith that the money you spend on making your deck won't be wasted when they completely rework/remove cards (hearthstone).

TLDR:
I don't spend money on game until I have spent enough time to know that it is a game I enjoy. That being said, Artifact's gameplay mechanics is slick enough that I could see myself spending money on it. However, the monetary structure of the game forces players to spend more money before they can really have more "fun", which is fankly a bit insulting. If they add a way to get new cards, I can definitely recommend the game, but as of now I cannot recommend the game to others.
I love Valve and pretty much most everything they do,  a fan since HF1.  With this being said I cannot recomend this game to anyone, as it's not fun to play for casual players, and the community has become so small that all those who stayed are pretty much tough as nails. Now Valve decides to introduce a progression system based on wins, in a game where getting a single victory is a stellar task. What this means is that there will be no new players coming and staying and it will be dead before long. Just stay away.
This game doesn't worth a penny,

pay to buy the game, pay to win the game.
you want to win? pay and buy awesome cards which lead you you through a SWEET WIN.
It is completly unfair and unbalanced game, I'm still wondering how Valve is gonna implement ranking system and competetive play.

it is totally a chance game that you paying for that, so why not just install Hearthstone FOR FREE?
Phantom draft is really great and fun but there is no incentive to keep playing. No rewards, no interaction, feels like i have no internet connection. Stop being greedy, most of the money you earn is from completly free to play game. 
Didnt even bother to try constructed, from the pool of card games i tried, this one feels most p2w. And still no reward for playing/paying it. Needs  patch asap.
Each day 4000 people less in daily peek. Currently 20k players  and its 1 week after release  (from 45k)?


First review ever

no

refund for me

srsly you greedy basterds screw you

EDIT:

Do not buy it, you can't refund it, those greedy motherf*ckers wont allow coz you opened stuff that is mandatory for the game.
I have played magic the gathering since the 1990's, when I found out that the creator of Magic was doing a brand new game, I couldn't contain my excited, I pre-ordered as soon as I could.

However, this was nothing like I expected.  The game play is very slow, the gameplay is too random, the cards that you can obtain without paying not worth it.

This is by far the most dissapointed game I have purchased in 2018.
Do not play this game. It is totally not worth the money. For £16 you can buy so many other great games and have 1000 times as much fun as in this. Not only you have to pay so much money in order to get good cards so you can have a decent deck which gives you a small winning chance, but you play for 1 hour where the winner depends on who gets lucky or not. I totally do not recommend playing this game. Be wise with your money usage.
The most boring card game I've ever tried. I don't even care about the market or any of that. I wouldn't play this game if it was entirely free and I love card games.
I've wasted enough time playing this game, a thorough review isn't quite worth spending the extra time or energy, but I have to write something to leave a review.

My issues are with the core gameplay and mechanics, not the economy -- something I'm not thrilled with, but I think is a stellar improvement over the extremely high pricepoint (Hearthstone/MTG) of Artifact's competitors.

Based on these issues, the game is a very hard pass.
Poor card game, way too much RNG:
- start game with heroes at random position...
- draw cards at random, yet cannot play them on the lane you need.
- heroes are unbalanced.

Waste of time and cash. Don't buy, it will become f2p eventually (soon, since its so bad)
This is not a monetization hate review. I was lucky, I opened my starting package and got both Axe and Kanna as well as tons of good cards. But ultimately they will remain unused because the game became boring during the 2nd tutorial and by the end of my first duel, I really wanted to refund the game (but ultimately could no longer do it, due to opening my starting package - although I never got the screen stipulating the lose of refund rights.)

So, where do I start...

Artifact is just a complex looking, but very simple to play game. There's some strategy involved, but it is very slow paced strategy with very few if any sudden turns. Each lane/turn there's resolution that unless you are playing with a very powerful deck, you can only barely influence. Most cards basically play with number bonuses and penalties, and the game has very few keyword abilities. It's a numbers game, all and all. Not very appealing if you come from an actual CCG. 

Duels take criminally long time to resolve, compared to your usual aggro play of 5-7 minutes in Eternal, MTG Arena and so on. It seems the game is very open to stalling where small mistakes cost you the victory. Looks like Garfield's both recent games (Keyforge and Artifact) favor slow, methodical play. Fine but Bo3 is basically a whole evening worth of play. Halfway in the game I want to leave not because of losing, but sheer boredom.

At the end, Artifact is a game that will not appeal to existing CCG players. It's simplistic approach and focus on simple algebra bonus and penalties compared to interesting synergies and effects will be its demise as the novelty wears off. Sure, Valve can push the eSport and hype the game to infinity and give away cards during Steam Deals and whatnot, but ultimately it is lacking that long-term appeal that will grow beyond the DotA community.
Don't let people tell you that this game has problems but the gameplay itself is great, they're wrong. Not only does this game have a horrible interface, ranked system and disgusting monitization system, but the base gameplay itself is just so.. boring. Do not waste your money on this garbage.
fucking wish i can get my money back..i guess i left the game on to help with the kids past out and got 30 hours...dont get me wrong i did try it a lot wanted to get into it but for 20$ and random cards and op plays if other ppl have cards it gg if i see a axe i wp gg out.stupid man
Someone was on some type of drug. Either crack or just plain power.

This is a game model that is essentially the usual "freemium" except that you have to buy in. The cash you spend on the game gives you just 5 packs and some tickets for arena runs (draft similar to hearthstone). They sell the packs at $2 each which I find to be very overpriced. You can buy singles of the cards at varying prices based when you build your deck so the usual p2w as people would call it.

You get a pack on each level. 550xp to reach new levels. You have a WEEKELY thing where you get 550xp. You average >30xp per game. It feels there is no incentive to be a new player. The matchmaking is terrible because the buy in isn't enough to compete with anyone. You get thrown in with people who want to spend extra cash for all the cards they want for the strongest net decks.

I love valve but I hate this product. Immensely. Requesting a refund now.
The core mechanics of the game are good, but this initial version of the game is badly done. 3 reasons given below, and I don't think they are likely to change any time soon, so RIP Artifact I think:

1. Random effects shake things up, but they are not well thought through which means that the fun-factor due to randomness is not zero-sum. That is to say, for the person that loses the coin toss it feels like unjust bullshit, whilst the winner will hardly notice. This means that the net effect of randomness is skewed more towards 'unjust bullshit', since even if results go 50/50 for and against you, you will feel the negative effects much harder. Examples of bad RNG include: Jinada, Cheating Death, Arrows.

2. The card pool is extremely limited. Whilst there are a variety of interesting effects, there are no ways to build strongly synergistic decks since the card pool simply doesn't support going 'all-in' on a theme or mechanic. This means that the best constructed decks are essentially a collection of the strongest cards which leads to a boring meta, and one where only the most money-invested players are competitive.

3. Hero power levels are all over the place. There are examples where choosing one hero over another is *never* better, no matter the circumstances. In particular, this applies to the strongest heroes - namely Axe and Drow, who valve have decided to also make the most rare. This leads to the situation where the two most necessary heroes for a competitive collection are also the most expensive due to their rarity - a decision that can only have been made as a cash-grab for valve in the market. I don't hate the market as a monetization strategy, but I do hate that the two strongest and most needed heroes were intentially made the rarest to artificially inflate their value.

Basically, stay well away from this game until at least 1 and possibly 2 expansions have been released. Also, if valve don't get on top of balancing card power levels soon then the game will absolutely be dead in the water. Finally, valve need to show some good faith toward the player base with regards to expense vs. power level on the market - it is not acceptable to intentionally inflate the market by making the most powerful cards the rarest.
Wait to buy it if you can help it. Game is fun but suffers from lots of problems that may or may not be fixed with the first few expansions. Yeah stats, profile, rank etc is nice but that will be added, I'm more worried about gameplay. Nauseating amount of unfun RNG, I mean almost everything is random. Yes skill plays a part and can win you games but regardless I disagree with game design like "Flip a coin and your hero either gets 11 attack or 7 attack" Its just not fun for either side. Hero and creep placement is random within the lane, which targets that units choose to attack is random. Every turn you are offered 3 different items, a choice of 1 random item from any item in the game, a choice of 1 item from your deck of at least 9, or a random consumable. Yeah you get the idea. 

I usually feel like im reacting to what the game decides to throw at me, not what the other player does. Your highest attack unit gets blocked by the 1 random creep spawn so you miss lethal, your bristle decides to attack the creep to its left instead of the 5 health tower to win the game. These things can be dealt with if you draft/include the right cards, but how is a card "Choose a new combat target" fun to use? All you're doing is undoing what the game did to you. 

Tldr: Too much bad rng to reccomend in its current state, wait for the new expasion maybe things will get better.
RNG Cancer

This game is complete trash.
If you wanna play against a P2W Deck, then go ahead and buy this game and play constructed.
Literally every game you enter, a player will have atleast one of the most overpowered heroes. 

The most balanced gamemode is Phantom Draft, as that is the only mode in which kiddies cant win using their mom's credit cards, Even then, you have a chance of getting put up against a player who managed to roll the lucky dice and get 2 Drow Rangers and one Axe.

Honestly, if you enjoy gambling, this game is a game for you, every single aspect of this game is based on luck, a player with great skill, can still get destroyed because a creep managed to spawn in the wrong lane or place. 

You either get decent cards in the free 10 packs or you use your credit card to buy axe. Even then you can only control so much, as most of the game is based on RNG, from a creep spawning into an unwanted lane, to a spell destroying most of your cards instead of the oponents (wrath of gold)

No skill required, only luck.
I really like the game but i cant recommend it to anyone until valve fixes most of the problems.

Pros.
-Good gameplay
-Good variety in decks
-Good concept
-Fun to play

The core game doesent have any problems but the social aspect and business module are the problem.

Cons.
-U cant earn cards by any other way than buying them or playing the gauntlet
-U get gauntlet tickets by buying them or disenchanting 20 cards
-U will run our of cards if u dont want to pay
-No daily rewards 
-Pay2Play2Pay2Win
-No ranked system
-No mmr system
-No player profile
-No chat or emotes to communicate with opponent
-Feels like a bad single player game

I still really like the game but i wish valve fixed some problems they have here
I played the game all weekend. I love card games and Artifact seemed very fresh. It's not though. 

I thought Hearthstone was the peak of RNG card games, but Artifact just dethroned them. Will your hero spawn across from a stronger hero and get killed right away? Will any random creeps spawn in the lane you want? Will you attack the target you want to?

No one knows, it's all rng. It's unfortunate cause I REALLY wanted to like this game, but it's just not good. If you love card games and are on the fence about Artifact...Run!


I spend some money, played a little, and found little to like. Mabye it's because I'm a casual, but I lose every game. After losing 12 straight games, it simply isn't fun. I'm no stranger to board games and card games, but RNG and very superior opponents has left me with an empty feeling when I play. Selling my cards and not playing again. :(
I'm only going to talk to about the negatives as i feel people need to be warned about the game.

- Performance issues, you could be getting 120FPS and the game still looks like it is running slow or choppy
- RNG
- Pay for everything business model, that includes earning booster packs, entering events to the cost of the game itself (NOTE: There are Casual free modes that give you nothing)
- No social communication whatsoever with your opponent (no emotes, no text or voice chat), you literally might as well be playing bots right now.
- No trading (You can purchase invidual cards from the Steam marketplace, but the best cards cost far too much)
- Deck builder is poor
- No profile, no stats
- No progression system
- No seasonal ladder
- No card backs or cosmetics to unlock
- No foils or premium versions of cards
- Your event tickets get you nothing If you lose, other games even offer you something for losing
- Poor to non-existant single player content
- Games are far too long
- There are bugs and glitches

I will commend Valve trying something new but they need to fix most of the above. If you are looking for a digital CCG to play in 2018, going into 2019 i would recommend seeking out the following from the competition.

GWENT
Magic: The Gathering - Arena
Hearthstone
Yu-Gi-Oh: Duel Links
Pokemon TCG Online
Artifact has so many design decisions that I do not understand. With initial lanes being randomized, attack angles being randomized and there being no ability to muligan any cards, the fast majority of the matches seem to be decided by the opening. The tempo you lose due to bad RNG and losing two heroes in the opening is practically unrecovarble. The concept of being able to redeploy where you want is fantastic on paper, but it simply doesn't work in practice. Next to that, the poor balancing of heroes makes certain match-ups neigh impossible to win. This game does not have a Dota level of balancing going on. In this game, some heroes are just stronger. Period. Extremely disappointing game thus far.
The first Valve game I actually don't like. The rules are are confusing and there's too much happening at random, three lanes are a poor concept - it is just like playing 3 mediocre games at the same time, which doesn't make it one great game. No interesting deck synergies as of now.

I'll give it another go or two, I'll try to find some videos or streams to maybe understand it better and "get it", but right now it's just not engaging enough for me.

And I have no issue with how the game is monetised. I'll happily pay £60 for a good game, or even more for something I spend a lot of time playing, so complaiont that it's not free to play IMHO is a bit silly.
I love the look of this game, and mechanically its amazing. However its such a money grubbing sheme, it's basically a scam which pisses me off since the game it self is fun to play. Get your shit together value ffs.
Kind of liked the depth, but I prefer playing Hearthstone arena like modes. When i used all the tickets I found out there is no way to get anymore without paying. So after 20 euro I am allowed to have a certain amount of fun and then I have to pay again.
I think this game is not so good, 7 out of 10.
Pros: Nice animation, DOTA characters and some of them I dont know who they are? Super strategic card game, you cant count the combination

Cons: Monoton, there's no RANK system, expensive game for me, no adventure mode or something when u play, u can get free cards or rare cards without money or ticket, pay 2 win is a must

I had high hopes for this game. A strategy card video game that is very close to a physical strategy card game. Unfortunately, the game mechanics rely on RNG more than I can tolerate. If you like games that rely more on strategy than putting a lot of RNG based cards in your deck to secure a win, look elsewhere until Valve rebalances and adds more features.

Things lacking:

1. No way to trade cards.
2. No way to put up a card of a certain value as a reward to the other player if they win (as an incentive to keep playing).
3. Leaderboards
4. A way to communicate with players - hopefully an in-game voice chat or full steam chat integration.
5. A more fair and evenly balanced algo that relies less on RNG luck.
6. Nerfing the Cheating Death card.
Its  really fun game.  but the balance of some cards, and the incredable amount (and i mean A LOT) of RNG in the game makes it very very tiring to play.  its kinda hard to get packs once you start and i would not recommend this game to anyone who doesnt love and already play collecting card games
dont buy this game, its boring, its not fun at all, its very slow and klunky. Also when u buy you get 10 free packs and if you open those packs steam won't let you refund this stupid lame game. GO BACK TO HEARTHSTONE OR MAGIC this game is gonan die within the year.
Miss gray text in corner, click typical "Claim Cards" golden button slammed in your face during tutorial missions, lose ability to refund this game.  

I have 10 unopened packs and still can't get a refund.  This was a trick, plain and simple.  Like not reading a licensing agreement page and finding you just subscribed to 5 magazines and a Cd-a-month club. 

Greasy, Valve.
I had high hopes for this game, and followed it since it was announced, but sadly it isn't the game it was hyped up to be. The game feels anti social, there's no ranked ladder or any goals to work for. The cards are stale and boring and the gameplay isn't addicting or entertaining enough. At this point it's more enjoyable following r/Artifact and laughing at all the people who are still in denial over there.
Game is unfinished with missing features and poorly optimized, don't even think about buying this game because it will go f2p and if not it will be doomed because there is no chance it will recover with tcg business model.
BEWARE! You can not get a refund for this piece of trash as it contains some starting item pack and Steam will deny you any refund. This is a scam!

"We cannot grant a refund at this time. This purchase included in-game items that have been consumed, modified or transferred. Artifact - Playtime: 25 minutes Call to Arms - Starting Items"

--- The game is complete Shit too ---

This game is neither fun nor anything special. In fact, the slow gameplay that insists on playing useless animations and the random placement and spawn of creeps makes this an excercise in patience more than anything.

There is nothing free to play about this. You will need to shell out a lot of money to be even remotely competitive or have insane luck at drafts which are so random that you might as well play the lottery every week.

Do not waste your money on this pile of garbage.
Very disappointed there isn't a way to obtain specific cards without buying them straight off of steam market. It's a 20€ game for fuck sake, and a decent deck costs 20€. Top tier ones can go way higher. 

Cannot recommend before this is changed.
PROS
+ Very beautiful artwork and graphics
+ Runs fantastically on Linux and uses Vulkan ! (like DOTA2, still has to be mentioned)
+ Tight UI, well thought, setting up a game is intuitive and fast, in game UI is good too.
+ Fun imps making faces
+ Good sounds, fun voices (had genuine laugh at the Ogre Magi)
+ Some interesting tactical mechanics (lane reordering, action turn bluff...)

CONS
- Multiple stacked layers of RNG. No control on the game flow (random card placement in lanes..), personal RNG deck in draft mode (no shared draft), full RNG hand at the start of the game with no deck order control (and then RNG card picks), RNG card effects.. It's definitely not Star Realms, or to pick another Garfield product, it's absolutely not Netrunner. Results in really infuriating games where you have zero control on the game flow, be it a win or a loss.
- No personal progression unless paying for tickets AND winning which is not a given at all
- Zero social interaction even out of games (apart from direct steam friends)
- No ladder, no replay, no history. Largely plays like a single player game
- Some horribly unbalanced cards, in both directions.

VERDICT
Cant really recommend it. There are way better CCG's out there, with a more rewarding gameplay experience. That's a shame because this one is a well crafted, beautiful product. The full-on RNG kills it for me.
Unrewarding XP system (only three first wins per week really matter).
No incentive to play = extremely small and declining player base.
As a level 2 guy I have to play against level 20s.

Can't refund game (under two hours played), if you open card packs to actually test the game.
Too expensive for what it offers.

And it's no fun to lose a match because running out of time, when you want/have to attack another lane and need to side scroll through the lanes but your timer still just gives you 4 seconds to finish this turn.
Changed item prices which is really janky for those that had good cards before this update, you can no longer place any value on the cards you own, as in the future they can always be nerfed at a whim.

What makes it so bad is many people bough the game and cards based on valves reputation, we were in effect true belivers. While player numbers went down and card prices fell we felt that the game would rebound because valve was a good developer that made good games. 

Falling card pirces didnt bother us because we belived player numbers would go up over the long run, however nerfing cards and then offering to buy them at the lowest prices is dishonest shame on you valve.
There are profitable business models, and there's really just open, greed-driven profteering. Most games made by major companies kind of find some balance where they try to squeeze as much money out of their consumers as possible in exchange for making us actually enjoy parting with our cash, but Valve appears to have thrown caution to the wind.

Despite the initial buying price of Artifact, which gets you two starter decks and 10 card packs with the game itself, the only possible method to acquire new cards is through throwing more money at the game, either by taking part in Valve's exploitative lootbox system or through buying cards through the Steam Market off of the people weak willed enough to buy lootboxes themselves.

And the lootbox system is exploitative. Ignoring the legal ambiguities regarding Valve's ingame gambling systems (which are now banned in several countries, a practice which will probably spread), Valve is fully taking advantage of the fact that you have already purchased the game and will, as a result, want to get the most out of that sunk cost. That is, they're encouraging you to throw bad money after bad. By immediately making you agree to waive your right to a refund upon redemption of the 10 card packs you get with the game, Valve rather expertly locks you into this arrangement aswell.

Mechanically, there's nothing really to write home about. The hero system is interesting and provides some decent constraints that make you have to think about how you structure your decks. Running three concurrent boards throughout the game is a questionable (but again, interesting) choice - you can either destroy two of the towers of your opponent, or destroy one tower and proceed to destroy their Ancient. There's no real point in attempting to destroy their Ancient as towers have half the health and you'll be forced to play for a win in at least two of the boards anyways, or else lose yourself. That said, the game is new and there's strategies to be formulated and explored.

Given all that, I can't recommend Artifact as it stands. Until Valve backtracks from its exploitative lootbox system, provides methods through which we can acquire cards for free through a reasonable time investment, this game is a simply a cashcow that's attempting to exploit the popularity of Valve's existing Dota franchise as well as the rise of competitive card games such as Hearthstone. This isn't a free to play game, a pay to win model is unacceptable.
I would hold off until they've fixed the monetization issues, and I would definitely not purchase the game unless you have the mobile authenticator up and active and you can list your valuable items on the Steam Marketplace immediately. This game seems to me to be more of an exercise of if they can create a marketplace for electronic cards like MTG has done for paper cards (the worst part of playing MTG), instead of the people at Valve trying to make the best card game that they can. 

It definitely feels like a game of dota, with all of the frustrations that go along with that, at least here you can control all 5 heroes, and you don't have people raging during game. But games feel about as long as a game of dota... Doesn't seem like the game is designed to allow for multiple playstyles either, sure I've only been able to play the two starter decks, but even still. "Control" seems less like control and more like just snowball your opponent until you have won tempo in all three lanes and then it becomes impossible to lose. And "brawler" feels less like a creature strategy and more like a boggles strategy, where you just over spend resources on two or three heroes, while your other two end up wiping again and again just as a two turn block (if you're lucky).

Anyway... I was really hyped, but the game doesn't seem fun to me, and everything that goes along with it seems like it compounds the fact that they want me to pay money to continue to play the game. C'mon, at least give me the ability to earn packs... but I understand that it would ruin the marketplace you all worked so hard to try and do well.
This game's user interface seems designed to obfuscate, making it difficult to understand what is happening during the limited time provided for your turn. The game also has some serious design flaws, such as 'pathing'; which employs a random percentage based chance of whom your unblocked heroes and creeps will target each round. -- Requires drastic improvements to provide even rudimentary strategic play. Leaving the player feeling like a spectator.
I didnt wait this game. My estimations were linked only with creator(who is creator of MTG).
Trying to be objective:
+ This game looks familiar to whoever plays dota/hearthstone
+ Design of the game is pretty sweet(especially those little imps that follow your deck)
+ Game is easy to learn
- Awful randomness of whats going on in the game(drafts, cards in your hand, equipments, placement on the table, lines of attack, lock of cards)
- Balance of the cards is nowhere to be seen
- No interesting mechanics for deckbuilding
- No way to earn prizes inside the game beside donating(or having win ratio close to 80-90% which is impossible cos of randomness)
- Huge range of duration of games(from 5 to 30 minutes)


In general, game not even worths trying. Just play Magic Arena nor Hearthsone, and never ever touch that game. Its just born dead. 

The most powerful card is credit card.
 no-ingame currency.
game becomes un-refundable because of Call-to-Arm's which is part of the purchase and steam says it's a consumable item that the game almost forces you to open before more gameplay.
Bought this game because I loved HS and TESL. Disappointed that you have to pay more for everything right off the bat if you don't want to play the crappy starter decks (no free rewards through playing). 

No ladder.
Closest thing is a matchmaking with hidden mmr.
No single player campaign.
The tutorial is a 30-min bore that doesn't explain the rules, just where to click.

You can resign/lose/win with no consequences in the free modes, so everything feels casual.
You can play the arena but obviously you need to pay to play.

Interface is great.
Game is great.

Can't get a refund (I thought all games could be refunded, I was wrong...)
I can't seem to overcome the feeling that I'm an ATM.
theres a whole lot of quirks here, like constantly having to press the advance token several times because the opponent decided to play multiple cards in single succession. and if you accidentally open the packs you're given, you are ineligible for a refund
I've been on Steam for over 15 years (i.e. before CS & Valve had profiles) & this is my first review I've left (probably for a good reason). I wish I could leave a positive review, but after playing over hundreds of hours and different decks, I can't. I originally loved playing beta and bought into the hype (*please note beta was short lived). 

The weird thing about this game for most users: it's not addictive. You can see that as a good or bad thing, but I'm just frustrated at this point--the frustration being: why would I invest so much time into a game that I find so mediocre.
Actually I bought this game long time ago, only today get time to write a review. Two big problems for me: 
1. RNG plays too large a role in play. I always view artifact as a strategy game. Superiority should be gain by careful consideration but not some pawn that takes up 30 damage!
2. I dont like to buy cards after I bought the game. You got to make one free or "able to be free".
If you haven't bought it yet, don't bother: the monetization scheme is downright abusive, players left the game in droves, and Valve is keeping total silence as usual. Got my money's worth of fun during my vacation, though.
I'd love to recommend this game, I really would. But honestly it's completely imbalanced as a card game. Red Heroes are absurdly powerful compared to just about all of the other colors, but not all the Red Heroes. Just a couple. So basically you pay $20.00 and hope you get Axe or Legion Commander. If you don't, well, sucks to be you. 

Oh you liked control in magic and going for a late game win? Yeah well better hope RNG governs what attacks what in your favor. I literally watched the random creeps place the entire enemy wave to block my mid attack and then all of my creeps went into the row I had already pushed down. Great.

Unless you're willing to pay $20.00 to play the game and then spend another $30-50 for the cards needed to make a top tier deck (Because not all cards are equal at all, there are so many cards that are similar but one is better by miles), don't buy this game. Also you can't even try it out, because it has "Packs" that you get right away which count as DLC or something, thus making it non-refundable.

Again, it has potential, but right now it's a community run by whales and if you aren't willing to be one of them by spending the money, spend your time and money elsewhere.
This game is really fun to play. Too bad you need to spend $300 on top of what you ALREADY spent to get any cards! There is no way to progress and get new cards unless you SPEND MONEY. And even then if you go to expert play and try your luck with the tickets you still can come up with NOTHING. I spent money for $10 on tickets in addition to the $20 the game costs. And I have nothing to show for it. I cant be competitive in any game mode because I lack any of the broken red heros they have like axe or bristleback. The randomness of the lanes and what your creeps attack is INFURIATING. I can be the best dam player in the world and if a little RNG is against me I LOSE. Where the hell is the strategy??
The game really does not do enough to differentiate itself from its competitors as one might think/expect. Thus far, the game seems no deeper than your traditional TCG. The game just feels average relative to aforementioned competitors. I am giving this a no recommendation for two reasons. One is the barrier to entry, $20 bucks just to play the game when some other TCG's are free (and they give you free starter decks) is just not acceptable (I am skeptical that the value is really there for Artifact), especially when the game is not all that much deeper or special. The last reason is the "expert play." In other games, high level play is not hidden behind a pay wall. Yet, in Artifact, all "Expert Play" game modes are hidden behind microtransactions. If I wanted to play ranked CS or R6 those modes are readily available at no extra cost. Here, they are all hidden behind tickets/microtransactions. I understand that you can win packs and tickets to make back what you spent, but the fact that there is no ladder/ranked system for people who just want to use their pre-constructed decks is a problem for me. I'll update as I play some more, but my feelings right now are this is just a slightly below average TCG with high level play hidden behind paywall.
Great concept on combat for a card game. I would love to play it, but i wasn't aware that the only way to obtain cards was to use money to do so. If there was a system to obtain cards or packs through challenges or dailies i would be fine. And now I'm not getting a refund because the game forced Call to Arms - Starting Items to me. Just remove the cards from my account so I can't sell them then, because i can't afford to play competative unless i give real money anyway. I really don't want to downvote a Valve game, but there is a first time for everything.
1) Monetization. Basically, you have to pay for everything. Yes, there are free modes, but the game philosophy is p2w.
2) Initially I thought that core gameplay is fun, but actually, it's:
    a) Insanely RNG related. Almost every core mechanic in the game is RNG based. Not to mention cards which provide insane bonuses with 25% or 50% chance. There is no skill in such type of game.
    b) Extremely boring after a while. You won't play this game more than 2 matches per sitting.
3) Fancy animations are fun for a while, but then they just annoy you since you can't skip them.

The saddest thing is that tf2's development almost halted because of this game. For instance, the project manager of this game is ex tf2 dev.
This game is begging for your wallet, it not like anything Gabe said. You can not play any decent deck out of the first 10 
initial packs,unless you SPEND MONEY. The only option for me that fun is casual draft, but even then how do you enter the competitive scene. Short answer is SPENDING MONEY, regardless of what mode you are in you have to PAY for tickets, or some time cardpacks, and no even if you win 5 matchs its only return the number of tickets you have spent so no avaiability in long term gameplay cause each time you lost is a ticket you drop. THIS MONETIZATION SUCKS A BIG D.TIME
well... after spend several attempts to win a single game to get a new card. (as the way it should be ,at least for me)
And finally I realized It doesn't give any of it. You can only get a card from buying it.
With 2+ hours learning its system and playing till got a winning game, now all I got is nonrefundable game due to 2+ playing time and so much disappointment.

The game is good btw. Good gameplay. Poor system especially the only way of getting cards. Truly pay to win.
The game has a nice style but the monetization is a big issue here and the market is very unstable. I'd give it another go when they work some stuff out. At least Valve gives refunds so props to them.
Interesting card game, certainly well made. Unfortunately I don't believe that the current monetization model will serve the game any good in terms of longevity. If you don't care about the money aspect, feel free to check it out. I am voting with my wallet and ask for a refund.
Pros:
- Great game. Not going to sit here and talk about this for miles but it is a good. solid. game. Play it if you like complicated CCGs like playing difficult decks in MTG.
- Good art and voice acting/effects. Well polished and presented overall

Cons:
- Clear meta: There's some really obviously good cards so if constructed is your jam, you will need to get those or constantly get crushed by them. There are two to three fantastic heroes in each color and every. single. match. you will see those combined into a deck of just good stuff that stomps all over you. This is my biggest grief about this and the way to fix this is sadly just going to be by nerfing something that (by now) people have paid good money for  OR  adding new content that hoses these Tier 1 heroes but that doesnt do anything to make the other heroes any more viable. Like mechanically the game is great but balance wise, I can't see how they fix this without pissing SOMEONE off.
I cant recommend this until they start having things like a free ranked mode, every competitive mode costs money, and you already have to buy the game and the only way to get cards is more money.
Kinda wish there was something between thumbs up and thumbs down to give this game. It's well designed, but for $20 I hoped to get a better start. If you want to be competitive you'll almost certainly be plunking down a few more bucks for packs, and they're pretty expensive. 

I'm playing "Shardbound" right now too, which was F2P to start, offered a significant starter pack for 5 bucks, and lets you win cards so often I've already opened 100 packs in just a couple of days without spending anything beyond the five smackeroos. 

The tutorial explained the core mechanics, but after that you're somewhat thrown to the wolves, especially regarding constructing decks. There's no additional information in the game outside the tutorials that I can find so I guess the idea is to read up on the web to learn how to really play the game. Some explanation about the cleanup phase as well as advice for deck building would have been very welcome. 

One minor issue with the game - matches are pretty long. Most games I've played have gone 20-30 minutes, which compared to similar games is a bit hefty. Aside from the game itself being designed that way, most of my opponents have stalled out thinking hard about what they want to do next. I wouldn't complain that a game like this causes too much thinkin', but it can be annoying at times, especially if your hero gets knocked out and all you can do it wait for your opponent to think think think, take an action only for you to pass again and again. 

Like I said above it's a well designed game, but I'm nervous that it's going to have a hard time finding an audience with the steep entry cost. And obviously games like this live and die on whether people are playing it. I'll probably keep playing for a bit, but I'm not sure I'll spend any more money. A "get started bundle" with discounted packs would be very very welcome.
It's really hard to say how i feel about this game. its fun, I love how it looks the little demons have me chuckling as i play. But to spend more money to get more cards just makes me feel meh, I get it this is becoming the norm anymore but i don't like it, its a double edge sword. Devoted players will spend money hand over fist and get tons of cards making it hard for people who will play it so so way under balanced. And there is no way for the so so players to get cards just by playing. My biggest gripe is the event tickets you spend money to play events and if you lose 2 matches you forfit your money for nothing not even a couple of cards for trying, S#@T i would rather set the cost of those tickets on fire with a lighter and get more injoyment from my pyromaniac side that i don't even have!!! With that being said i would say buy at your discretion, i'll still play it i just won't do events mabe buy a couple packs but i will wait and see what the future holds for this game.
If I were a popular streamer whos fans provided the funding neccessary to own cards and play competitively, I might give this game a positive review. But this is a $20 game, that then charges $2 per 10 card pack, and then charges extra every time you want to play a ladder match.

There are no in-game currencies.

You pay out of pocket for the privledge of paying out of pocket.

2018 has just been a terrible year for gaming, hasn't it? EA, Blizzard, Bungie, Valve, etc... All of these developers releasing cash-grabs or lukewarm titles at best. Then there's the confirmation that there is no God due to the rise of Fortnite...
It's sad when the best game of the year was Assassin's Creed.
Got it, played it and now I'm reviewing it. That's how simple this game is. When purchasing the game, you'll get 2 pre-constructed decks, 10 card packs and 5 tickets. 

The tickets can be used to play in "Expert mode" where if you win 3 or more games (without losing twice before that) you can get your ticket back and additional card packs. Sounds good? No, because here's where the problem starts, tickets need to be purchased. That's the only way to gain them. Sure you can say, "git gud" but then, constructed play is superbly difficult to win because there are always people who buy tens if not hundreds of packs. Sure you can say "just play phantom draft lol" which is super RNG based in just drafting your deck. Its not any much easier to win when compared to constructed play. The biggest problem with this is that you're forced to stick to phantom draft most of the time because "Expert mode" is the ONLY way to earn any packs in this game. 

This brings up the first forseeable problem with this game which is the longetivity of the game. With the amount of money that is needed to build your own constructed deck and to play "Expert mode", it is inevitable that eventually the playerbase of this game will decrease. 

Do I recommend this game? It's a gray area really. I enjoy playing the phantom draft but I'm only 4 hours in, I don't know if I'll continue to enjoy it 10 or 15 hours in. The only thing I wish that Valve would incorporate in this game is a way to earn card packs, whether it be daily challenges or achievements or even winning in the casual play (and maybe giving greater rewards in expert mode). Maybe then this game would reach its full potential and only maybe then would I recommend it.
Oh boi, where to start...
lets try the positives! It looks nice, has a decent ruleset, music, presentation are all top notch. Annnnd, that's about it on that side.
As for the negitives, sweet jesus, where to begin.
Hero placement for start of game is random leading to uncontrollable immediate deaths, creep placement random, not enough cards to form more than 3 meta decks, some colors are just inherently better than others, mixing doesn't help as much as it does, feels like MTG 1.0, hollow wins and losses because of how little is controllable.
I could go on forever and that's not even mentioning the microtransation BS being thrown around.

TL;DR great skeleton of a game but this is alpha game at best mechanically
Pay money to pay more money. 

There is no way to "grind" cards casually like in Hearthstone for example. To get packs you need to play a paid game mode aka "Expert Mode" (entrance cost: 5 entrance tickets for 4.50€) and on top of that you need to win at least 4 games BEFORE losing 2 games to get a single pack out of it. 

The gameplay is fun, strategic and new but the payment system that evolves around the communty market (to grab dem sweet selling fees) is completely unfriendly to casual gameplay. Essentially Pay2Win.

EDIT: After playing 40h or so I have decided to quit. Even though a "mechanic" has been added to "earn" packs (quotes because after playing for 4hours I earned 1 pack just because of having the weekly bonus active). 

The RNG in this game is mind breaking and the "draft skill" increases despite of being a loser.  3/10 game.
The game has a lot of potential, however its failed to avoid the mistakes of other virtual cardgames and hasn't followed the sucesses of other Valve games.
I don't recommend this game because, until Valve changes the monetization scheme. Nice experiment which is not user-friendly at all. 

First of all I want to point out that the game mechanics are great and interesting. Goog game overall.
Biggest cash sink in the history of cash sinks.

Buy if you want to have to pay to win. No free cards, no free packs, you have to pay to play in tournaments... the list goes on.
The initial $20 USD is just for access to the program so that you can use it to pay more money. And after you pay enough, you still have to pay every time you want to play any mode that isn't completely meaningless. This game is beyond bare bones except for the payment system which is fully fleshed out.
I am going to give this a very HONEST review. And some wont like it, because the game is NOT balanced.

So first, references: I have been playing Magic since back in the 90's when you used to get beat up at school for playing the "devil card game"... and people called you a nerd and kicked your B*tt or trashed your books and clothes... no joke. MY, how the tables are WAY turned now...
I also am an avid ES legends player, and have dabbled in several other TCG over the years.

Artifact is a game for people who have the money to buy into it. Flat out. It is ENTIRELY built on the old style of TCG. You want to play, buy a pack. You want to be more competitive, buy more cards through boosters. Funny thing, the price of the boosters all these kids are complaining about, is exactly the same price Magic used to cost for a starter and a booster back in the day. So stop complaining, and go get a job that can make you twenty dollars a week and youll be caught up in no time... now, that said....

This game has a few fundamental issues that were not balanced properly. First off, only certain heroes are worth a damn. Some heroes have CLEAR advantages early game. Making it nearly impossible to not pick those heroes to play with. If you try to experiment, you will lose more than win. FOR SURE. 

Specifically, there needs to be a severe reduction on hero life for some heroes. Sven and Bristleback and Centaur... can literally be out of control by round 3, and for non-elite players... it is going to be a real problem. Because even if you kill heroes like Sven and Lycan... they are so powerful that they come back into the game 2 rounds later on respawn, and are still viable. Other heroes, including heroes that should have more abiilty to stay and fight in lane... NOT EVEN CLOSE.

So the game is very one sided, lacks a diverse meta, and honestly gets VERY boring after two games. 

Next, due to to the VERY stale meta, the lane mechanics fail. Creep waves do NOT respawn turn by turn in lane. The creep cards are placed into random lanes, and your heroes you assign to lane are randomly assigned to a location. So you have no means to actually create any kind of strategy that directly counters certain problems in lane. the game becomes 90 percent RNG based by card picks. So, often you will be stuck with lanes that have NO creeps in them, with heroes double or trippled up in a lane and WRECKING it. And no way to strategically counter if you have used ANY hero besides the ones that are in the meta.

Then there is the issue of ways to win. Destroy two towers, or defeat an 80 point core after breaking down one tower.... In my humble opinion... fuck that!
Destroy my tower, allow the core HP to be universal per lane, and allow mulitple lanes to attack my core... SURE. But dont make me lose after two towers.
I have lost several matches due to me plinking away at a core with 15HP left,  and my oponnent lazily destroys two towers because of RNG on the cards and I lose... that is NOT strategy or skill based play and it honestly SUCKS when it happens!

As it stands, this game is for people who have disposable income, are fans of the genre, and who are willing to spend the money and wait probably 6 months to a year before Valve actually takes the time to do balancing properly. As is there usual timeframe with DOTA 2 at least.

I think that for most players, this game will need to be pushed aside, and come back after the release of some of next years titles to be one of those games you use to decompress and take a break. Artifiact has some serious issues fundamentally that can be exploited in lane mechanics, hero meta, and tower destruction. Its just not a game that is currently worth it for anyone who cant afford to play it. Its just not THAT good.
Game is terrible. Really slow to play and costly to be any good. Opening packs isn't really worth it as you only get pennies for most cards. Impossible to grind for more cards and there isn't much incentive to keep playing. It gets old really fast. Also if you can't refund the game.
Very disappointed with the game. As a CCG player i was really excited to see what Valve would do. But after playing i think it's clear Valve got into a genre they don't understand. If you tried this as your first CCG and didn't like it, do yourself a favor and try Eternal on Steam.
The monetization isn't blatantly offensive. Anyone that's played a paper card game of some kind will be familiar with it, and this game isn't even as expensive as magic or any other paper game. I could very easily go to the market and buy every card in the game for less than it'd cost me to build my way to a meta deck or two in one of this games direct competitors. But I don't want to do that. 

Something just feels fundamentally wrong with the constructed gameplay. I can't articulate it well. In any other card game, plays are large enough that, typically, you can feel the impact the card you just played has. Mistakes are readily apparently, strong plays are immediately and obviously rewarded. Artifact is content to let you make a mistake, only to not let you see an apparent effect until several turns later. In a way, it calls back to ye olde Sierra Adventure games, that would let you play for hours after making a game ending move. Whoops, you didn't put a piece of tape on the fence to collect hair from a passing cat to create a fake mustache, better luck next time. For fans of Dota that have somehow made their way over to this game, this element of Dota has managed to translate quite nicely into artifact. "Ah, well, see, there's your problem, your carry farmed gold 1.2% less efficiently than the enemy carry, so they got their Game Winning Item first and that's how they managed to wipe your team 30 minutes later. Better luck next time!"

Drafting is still quite fun. It will only get more fun as they introduce more sets. Thankfully, there is a free draft mode. The absence of rewards aren't much of a dealbreaker if you aren't even aiming to collect cards to play constructed mode with. The paid gauntlets are there if you feel like betting a buck and possibly hours of your time on winning 5 bucks back in prizes. 

Thankfully, the 'brilliant' marketplace that also serves as a sole reason behind why no card can ever see significant balance changes also allows you to effectively cash out of the game. I don't know exactly how long cards will maintain their value (who will be buying the cards as the game falls in popularity?), but for the time being, you can buy this game, sell off whatever you get from your packs, and permanently participate in free tournaments, a free draft mode, and even event gauntlets that feature pre-built decks. It's entirely possible that if you stick it out or wait long enough, Valve will make some significant changes to the game. Your ownership of the game will always be there, even if you sell every single card you own. The way I see it though, if there are already more games for me to play than I have time for, many of which are already fun and not marred by fundamental problems, I don't really think it's fun or necessary to stick it out in the hopes that "it'll get better!", "wait for the next set!", "the next gauntlet rotation will blow your mind, you'll see!"....

For most players, your enjoyment of the game is going to hinge entirely upon whether or not your friends are willing to go in on it with you. For others, it may depend upon how much time you're willing to put into forcing some measure of fun out of the game by interacting with off-site communities on discord or major forums. I mostly like to keep to myself, playing on a ladder or in some "high stakes" mode that has me wagering some form of tokens or currency that represent time I spent playing the game, rather than wagering money. I don't think artifact will EVER let me play exactly like that, and it's not for me. 

Some might even call me a lizard brain dummy addicted to the endless dopamine offered by any other video game, I say the meta elements surrounding the actual gameplay in Artifact are poorly designed and the game should not have launched in this state. Realistically, Valve will get one more chance to polish the game up real good, as they'll have another soft-launch when the game becomes available on mobile phones and tablets. If you are on the fence about this game, I highly recommend you just wait until then.
Balance isn't in the vocabulary of Valve.
I don't know how they justify the entry pricing for this game. They give you a bunch of card packs and a month of dota plus for free - can't they just deduct that from the price and make the game free? 
There's no way to obtain new cards or tickets for the game modes that give you a *chance* to obtain new cards - without swiping your credit card. 
There's no progression system whatsoever. There's not much at all, if anything, that's rewarding about playing the game.
Not to mention the dodgy refund practices, where if you open the initial card packs that they give you - you can no longer refund the game.
Very entertaining card game with incredible potential, only to be put to the noose with pay to win and microtransactions further made taut by the utter lack of natural card collection. Without any means to get cards for free, work towards them with daily challenges or random drops this game's market will be flooded with whales who all own the rarest and most powerful cards, selling them for sums of money unaffordable to the average player.

Whoever thought players would want this kind of intrusive and microtransaction-gated experience needs to have their keyring taken from them and divided up between people at their office, to be bought back from them at a price equivalent to their level of importance.

Real bang-up job, Valve.
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! This game should have been released as an BETA to see the intrest, but paying almost $20 for this game is not worth the slow level ranking, ranking system matchups and random game modification scales. This game is broken, it's not even a joke. I can see this game going free to play soon like most card games.
The problem with a "physical TCG economy" as its implemented here..... You don't actually own your cards in the sense that:
1. You can't sell them for REAL cash.
2. You can't even TRADE them.
3. You must use Valve's marketplace to get/sell cards(in order to 'obtain from'/'give to' other players), which equates to losing money on every purchase due to Valve Tax.

And admittedly, something about the game just isn't really appealing. I certainly agree there is high-level strategy, I just lack satisfaction from my wins.
As many people already said, the monetization scheme is not quite good at the moment:

The fact that you cannot obtain cards/packs other than paying could be somewhat OK, in a trading logic with market eventually lowering prices in the future as more offer comes (right now Axe hero costs about 20$ which is the cost of the game....). Also the fact that draft play allows you to play without having in your collection all competitive cards is fine.

However having all modes of expert play costing tickets that cannot be obtained without using money is disturbing.
It is purely limiting access to some gameplay/parts of the game and seems very unfair in my honest opinion. I will monitor how Valve will consider all this feedback and sincerly hope they bring some event that allow you to earn tickets at least.
edit 21-1-2019 : IF YOU MAKE IT FREE2PLAY and make some updates it can still be revived,
otherwise Pepega.

>literally everything< cost money FeelsBadMan
ALL IM TRYNA SAY IS --> LET PEOPLE EARN INGAME CURRENCY IN ORDER TO GET CARD PACKS AND EVENT TICKETS
WE DON'T HAVE HALF LIFE 3 SO THIS CAN EXIST??? A good game, but the pay 2 win model feels outdated and immediately stiffling in comparison to Magic Arenas.
Don't buy this game.

I'm baffled. Who tf thought this type of cash grab game would be sustainable?

-You use one $1.50 ticket to get into phantom draft. (5 free tickets for buying the game) 
-If you get a 3/5 run,(40% chance) you get your ticket back, and if you get more you get packs. (33.3% chance for one pack, 16.7% for two packs) 
-A pack pays for half a ticket,(20 recycled cards = 1 draft ticket) meaning you need three packs won before you can make any form of profit from it. 
For all of you gamblers out there, those might seem like good odds, but considering you're new to draft, you will spend those 5 tickets at a loss in the blink of an eye.

Constructed is out of the question. Card whales spend their money buying 50 packs, or expensive cards off the steam market to make decks that are impossible to beat. You can either fork money over to buy cards, or recycle all of your decks for phantom draft tickets.

So draft is out, and then constructed is out. What is valves response to this glaring issue?
"FORK UP OR GET OUT! IT'S PAY TO PAY!"

The game is good, but it doesn't matter if it's good if I'm constantly playing at a disadvantage. I was looking forward to this game for so long too... Valve, you made me pay $20 to rope me into microtransactions. You are dispicable. Don't expect me to pay for another game from you if this is the type of company you have sunk to.
I like the Idea of a Dota/Cardgame, and the resulting game itself is great, but the combination of Pay2Play and Pay2Win is horrible, this even gets worse due to the fact that there is not a single way you could get more cards/tickets without investing more money. I hope Valve finds a solution, as it would be a shame to just let such a good game die.
This game lacks innovation where it should've been innovative. And it doesn't drag you in like Hearthstone. The graphics is plain, the card arts aren't impressive, I don't even wanna look at them, they're just cards when they should be heroes, artifacs etc. Valve should've tried making this a 3d card game, but I guess mr. Garfield is old-school. Too old-school. Also I  don't like the win condition concept - every lane matters in Dota, not just 2 of 3. The only good thing about Artifact is that it expands Dota lore, I'm looking forward to it, but NOT ta playing this game.
Bought this game after the big patch because that seemed really customer friendly only to find out they stealth reduced the packs you got from 10 packs to 5 packs, so honestly feel like I got scammed, don't buy this nonsense.
Giving it a thumbs down for the mixed review

RNG is so horribly designed. From directional arrows to All allies have 50% chance to survive with 1 health
Bad RNG is where one player will have a poor experience of the game and believe me, Artifact got tons of it
RNG IS important in card games I dont deny, but there is Bad RNG & Good RNG which I'm not going to discuss here
My point being is even if you play well, the opponent can still turn it around, in a stupid way
Being able to comeback is great. But being comebacked by some coin flip isn't
Good plays should be rewarded and bad plays should be punished, this is how it should be, not only for Artifact but for every card game
I don't see the game balance too. People are either playing red black or blue green. And Blue Green Infinite Mana deck, man.. Absolutely frustrating to play against
Then there's the monetization model which I don't need to say anything about

At least all of these problem Can be fixed (if they want to) because the problems are not based on the core mechanic of the game
They can better rework the RNG & card design, give some kind of progression system, add ranking system, player interaction etc.
After 60+ hours I find it a beautiful, fun game, with a more-than-average randomness and a nice flavour. These are pretty much all the positives in Artifact. The price of the game, for starters, is OVERWHELMING considering that card packs have to be bought and that even to play you have to buy tickets. The content is very poor even for a card game that has not even reached its first expansion. But the most enraging thing in my opinion is the disgusting way the player base has been ignored by developers. Patches are infrequent to say the least, and shallow too. There is a complete lack of communication ( no, saying they're "in for the long run" is not considered communicating ) and today, 26/02, there is no update about anything that could make the players consider not leaving the game ( around 500 players connected at each time ).Valve silence policy cannot be considered a policy: it's pure and simple lack of respect. For me, this game had the potential to be with other much beloved, successful card games, such as hearthstone, mtg arena, etc. and simply chose not to, for greed and hastiness. Too bad.
My bad that I've got caught by the overwhelming Artifact hype around.   I'm aware that I haven't played much, but you know what they say.  The first impression is the most important one.  The game is way too random and confusing,  the art style is far from being an eye-candy.  Most of the arts are mediocre at their best.   And of course how can I escape the monetization issues.  C'mon,  it's too greedy for a game we paid initially for.   Sorry, Valve, but I demand for refund.
This game was a predictable disaster from the beta.  Only provided to Valve-associated gaming pros who were more focused on mechanics than fun in the testing phase, the game turned out to be clean, but not terribly enjoyable.  Solo play can be fun in short bursts, but multiplayer is an annoyingly uneven catastrophe.

Want to play a fun card game?  Try one of the many others.
Gameplay-wise, it's a card game. There are many just like it.

This one does:

Not have a ladder.
Not have a play2win model.

It can be improved but there's legitimately no reason to play this over any other choice unless you're just burned out on them or really like DOTA's lore.
Lots of rng garbage and unbalanced cards.

Do NOT buy this game if you have trouble preventing yourself from buying card packs. You will lose all of your money. The way to get card packs is bullshit and the market system is a fucking scheme
I'm fine with buying a game... But there is no actual ingame way to grind for content and packs. The only way to get further is by purchasing packs with money.

I geuss there is draft mode...
I love the game.  It's just like a real TCG and I don't understand what is so difficult to understand about that.  It's missing a few things I expected like chat or communication of some kind, but I believe it will get there.  Game is extremely fun and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time playing it and believe I will continue to do so after future expansions.  There is no progression system which seems to rub a lot of people the wrong way.  Personally I would rather spend money to purchase the cards/decks I want to play; when the alternative is spending loads of time grinding for a slight chance of getting the card I want, but apparently that's abnormal.  I would highly recommend this to any real world TCG players.  Hearthstone loyalists...not so much.  (Also there was plenty of news that there would be no earning cards in game I don't know why it's such a surprise).

**UPDATE**
Valve has since decided to cater to those that didn't enjoy anything about the game in the first place.  Adding grinding for cards and greatly reducing the amount of time you have to make decisions are the 2 that bother me the most.  I know I'm alone on the time thing but this is a complex game and I was not taking that long but now a forced surrender because no kind of timer resets after my turn....really?  I was really excited to have an online card game that I can buy the cards, not buy a chance to get the card that I want.  They will likely be moving it to a f2p model and I (as a person with more money than time) am very sad about that.  This game had potential, it could have fit into a niche that really isn't there yet but it seems in their efforts to please everybody they have succeeded in pleasing nobody.   Goodbye Artifact, wish I could say it was worth it but it sure as hell wasn't.
I desperately wanted to enjoy Artifact, but it currently stands as a monument to the flaws of early CCG design. It’s random, it’s expensive, and it does a horrible job of teaching players both basic gameplay and high-level strategy.
Can't refund it, despite not opening packs or using an event ticket, I played a couple bot games hated it and now regret it.. Apparently accepting them equals using them fuck this game.
I literally can't refund this game because I opened the packs you get when you buy the game.  They don't even make it obvious that you forfeit your right to refund it either, apparently there's very small text somewhere on the screen that's deceptively easy to miss instead of a popup telling you.
As always VALVE makes great game and good mechanics.
But game is not really addictive or fun playing with friends like usually have been.
Right now there is too much cons in order to recommend.
My biggest problem right now is pay2pay system. Once you buy a game and open free packs, there is not any other way to get cards - only buying it from store (Right now not even tradable). They could prevent this problem with some daily/weekly task where you could get [b] UNTRADABLE and NOT MARKETABLE [/b] cards.
Second problem is game is not fun and not very attractive for my friends to play together. Best thing about VALVE games was  playing games together and having fun with friends. Right now there is nothing to do.
Right now ARTIFACT looks like a game that only swipe other card game audience and not making new one.

TLDR;
- pay2pay
- can't get packs for just playing game
- it is not addictive
- not game for you & friends, like other Valve game
This is a hard game to review. It was fun the first few days, however make no mistake: this is the definition of "pay to win" model that is rotting the core of modern day gaming. Whats worse, it isn't even free to play. 
I bought the main game and a few boosters but it is not balanced nor fun. You'll probably lose most of the time unless you make a big investment money-wise... and I've made my homework creating decks and watching tutorials but none of that helped. Even after that, your path to victory will depend heavily on luck. 
Games take between 30 and 45 minutes, so you need to make time for a match. Network is stable, and even when I got disconnected, I got reconnected quickly, so thats a plus.
The animations are long and tiresome, it surprised me how fast they started to get into my nerves, since they are an absolute waste of time. I wish the game was faster paced and matches would last no more than 10-15 minutes.

It has high replayability value game-wise, and the game might be better if you play it with friends, but I did not.

Stay away and save your money for some other experience, one that values your time and efforts better.
Cheers.
I am severely upset with Artifact's business model and gameplay. I decided to pick it up on a whim (as my friends were) as I'm a fan of hearthstone, duelyst, Faeria. Thinking I would get a good amount of content for a $30 up front. 
What I found on the inside was a ridiculously monetized marketplace, which admittedly is closer to an IRL card game, but it offers no way other than limited arena runs, to obtain cards through skill alone. 
Furthermore, I have not found the game itself to be very much fun. In its current state it seems quite unbalanced, especially when you take into consideration the heavy HEAVY random elements, which is not something I expected from a DOTA2 based game. Due to these reasons, I wanted to refund Artifact. 
However, you cannot. When you pass the tutorial, you are greeted with ten shiny packs. And since everything in this game is monetized, that's essentially buying DLC, causing steam to reject the refund, which is absolutely ludicrous. I have not and will not touch the marketplace, so what does it matter if cards sit or get deleted in my account? Just let me get my $30 back and be on my way. It is within 2 weeks, I have not spent excess money on it, but I do have 4.5 hours playtime as it took that long to understand how awful it really is. Don't buy this game. And steam support is a shitshow too.
So close to being a great game. However, the games run too long (30+ min) to permit much RNG. And you have to have permit A LOT of RNG to enjoy this game. Personally, I have no problem with the RNG on the cards themselves, and card draw RNG is a given, but Artifact introduces two new manner of RNG - the positions your units take on the board are randomized and so are the directions in which they attach. Artifact also provides you the unique opportunity to play a game for 45 minutes, agonizing over complicated and exciting decisions every turn, only to have the game come down to a coin flip targeting decision. And you WILL get to experience this often.
I regret not selling cards sooner. After that TI announcement, I thought it would be a well-executed game when it came, giving a nod to the 3rd world FTP dota folks that built the reputation its capitalizing off of -- I was wrong. The worst part wasn't the pricing, it's the game is not super exciting at its current state and VALVE seems to have given up on it. When the announcement came that valve was bundling the 10 packs with the game purchase (to prevent refunds) I should have known not to buy-in. I thought, hey, at least I might get a cool courier in dota -- no dice. I won't make this mistake again -- unless... release a Dota 2 RPG and then we'll talk.
I played it for about 2 days and got bored. I like card gams quite a bit and I'm even fine with monetization. I guess what I dislike about this game is feel like games are randomly decided by turn 1 with the random placement of heroes. Also feel like only a few heroes are viable making the games all feel pretty same since only a few cards are worth playing. I wanted to like this game but couldn't.
Well... I wanted to like this game, I really did. But first impressions let it down, the game-play is slow, dull, repetative, and non-intereactive. 

Buy are you're own risk, you might like it but I didn't and I have played TCGs for 18 years.
It's one thing not enjoying the game, That's down to personal preference/ opinion. It's another thing when you can't refund it. We've been scamazzed bois.
You have to pay to play the game and actually pay for every pack/card/event and there is no way to actually grind the game
Valve just tranformed into EA/Ubi
ofc it had to be on a dota card game with good mechanics i'm seriously pissed off

Requested an insta refund
Game actively tries its hardest to drive away casual players, small and actively decreasing player base, easy to queue into people with way better decks and way better skills, almost impossible to get new packs unless you grind like mad. Probably only worth playing for the 3 wins per week quest, but other than that don't bother at all.
No invoker.

Update after almost 30 hours: Well done, Richard Garfield, for a SHITTY game design. So much RNG that one can only laugh at how completely ridiculous it is. Right at the start, you can already get matched up and have heroes killed outright without player decision. It is all assigned by luck - at least let us have the illusion of choice to place the heroes. Characters attacking into unguarded lanes can randomly be assigned to attack a diagonal enemy - again by pure luck. Melee creeps that get spawned every turn appear randomly in one of three lanes - you guessed it, by pure luck again. Your secret shop shows 1 powerful item each turn for purchase, yes yes randomly. Your pre-assigned deck has about 9 items but only 1 appears each time (yesss, you are getting good now. In random order via pure luck) Ah yes yes there are consumable items available for purchase each turn too - RANDOM YAY! These are all on top of the usual luck generated by random card order when drawing from your main deck, as is typical in any card game.

Erm... what are we playing again? Roulette? I get what Richard is going for here. A brainless card game that the mass audience can have fun with, where skill is secondary and luck is everything so no one ever feels left out. If you want an edge, swipe credit card for highly imbalanced cards to draft. And yes, even then it goes down to more than 5 factors of RNG across various parts of the game as mentioned earlier. If you are lucky and you get that one card to win *cough*Vesture of the Tyrant*cough* you literally have a walk-over. There are obviously things that can break items, then again - timing of the draw blah blah blah. RNG yup.
One of the best card game ever made, with a terrible buisness model.  The $20 entry fee gets you fewer cards than a fresh Hearthstone account. You'll need to spend another $30-40 for a decent constructed deck.  However, if you are a fan a draft mode.  That may be enough to satisfy you alone.

The one redeeming factor with this buisness model, is the ability to buy specific cards directly.  So if you prefer constructed modes, just do that.  Don't waste money on gambling on card pack. Most cards are worth about $0.05.  So the $2.99 per pack could instead be spent filling out a significant portion of you collection directly.

You may have heard you can "get cards just by playing now."  Don't be fooled.  You can't just grind out your whole collection like in HS.  The max number of free packs is 15.  With matches that can run 15-20 minutes, and 100+ matches needed to grind all 15 packs.  You would be better off working a minimum wage jop during that time and just completing your whole colection out right.

TL;DR:  The gameplay is great.  But I can't reccomend buying it unless you have money to burn.  Or are happy sticking only to Draft mode.


What you people don't see is that this is a virtual game before a TCG. The gameplay you get isnt worth the original price. You cannot build a decent deck without spending. So you already lose a part of the gameplay. 

If we add the fact that they say you can refund the game if you claim your starter decks. Well you now have pretty low quality gameplay just to try it. And you can't try the deck builder at all.

Another point is that this is the first game valve published in years, and it is a complete cash grab.
While the core mechanics are (mostly) excellent--aside from a tad too much Hearthstone-esque RNG--the game lacks a progression system. This is extremely surprising coming from Valve, the company which essentially helped start the mtx and loot box craze. There is no visible indication of your rank (there is hidden mmr, though), there is no experience system of any kind, there are no achievements (on a Steam title by Valve!), there is no stats page, there is no match history page, there is no per-deck winrate breakdown, and there is essentially zero external reward for grinding. In 2018, the lack of external reinforcement mechanisms in a game will lead to a dwindling player base. They will go play games which do have some of these features. 

I'm not sure if any of these stats are accessible through their API, but needing to constantly use an external tool to render data which is available to Valve is a bit silly. I would not suggest buying this until they add some form of a progression system. Remember that even Pac Man had a rudimentary progression system in the form of visible high scores which were used as goalposts in subsequent runs.
Horrible RNG Game. Abandoned by developer. Abandoned by community. I kinda knew this was gonna happen after what they did to DotA 2 over the years...

Pure shit, honestly. Huge huge letdown. 
Just RNG is so pathetic in this game it's not even funny anymore.
This happens when big companies try to milk as much money as possible out of a game. 
- no ranked system in a competitive CCG except for Draft Mode
- tedious gameplay, people get too much time for each turn
- takes up at least 20min for each game, a standard game lasts 25-30min
- no alternative options of getting cards outside of buying cards with real money 
(wow they added packs up to a certain LV and never again)
It's fucking dead on arrival for a reason. MTG Arena is going to overtake Artifact from learning from their mistakes.
[3,9/10]
Valve hasn't made a game since 2013 and this is the game they give us after no L4D3 or HL3?

Honestly, I was never big on Magic but I remember that way more fondly than this. The fact that I pay $20 for a card game and then have to buy cards on top of that is ridiculous. Doesn't Valve have enough fookin money?

Honestly, the game should be free and packs should be like 50 cents.

UPDATE: This game currently sits as the 90th most played game on Steam. The changes have not been enough. What a nose plant by Valve. GJ d**s***s.

UPDATE: 1/14/2019 and Artifact is off the top 100 chart on Steam. MapleStory 2 and Football Manager 2017 are ahead of this crap. THANKS FOR SPENDING TIME ON THIS AND NOT EPISODE 3 WHICH YOU PROMISED TO CUSTOMERS!!!!!
My own CCG experience has been with Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone.

This is one of the worst CCGs I have ever played. Overtuned gameplay mechanics want you to think the game is complex and cool. But, in reality, it's just boring and pretentious.

Pros:
- Potential expansion and exploration of DotA 2 lore.
- I'm glad there was a refund option.

Cons:
- No progression system.
- Super long games (My time was about 30-40 minutes per game).
- Boring gameplay masked to be complex. But, in reality, gameplay feels like a chore.
- Pay $30 upfront for the game and you don't event get a decent card pack to play with.
- Sometimes I couldn't attack certain cards and the game doesn't explain why. This was during tutorial mode.
boring (even if u sink more money into card packs) and a waste of money, you can't return the game after opening it. go play hearthstone. my faith in valve goes unrewarded, maybe epic games really is about to take the throne.
Just because a 3-lane card game based on the DoTA2 franchise can be made, doesn't mean it should be made.

This is a swing-and-a-miss for me.

Pay-to-play effectively. Difficult to acquire new cards without an awful grind.
Already feel ripped off. Payed for the game and after the tutorial is nothing left to do, you can paly practice matches with kinda no cards or pay more money for stuff. It s like MTG in real life. If you like the game (it s not that great imo but not bad) and have like  monthly 100bucks floating around to invenst , then it s a game you should play.
Player base so low i get matched with people 10 levels above me. It's a shame cause its not a bad game at all. RNG can be somewhat handled but there are many situations where a creep rng will lose you the game. It is definitely pay2win for constructed mode. I mostly played featured modes which are fun tbh.

Wouldn't recommend spending $20 on this game in its current state but if player base rises in the future then go ahead and pick this game up (preferably at a discount or if it becomes free to play).
Tried playing but kept getting network issues. Could not connect to the server, keot getting booted out and the lobby system was intermittently available. Will update when I actually get to play it.
Honestly i am disappointed ... you would think that Valve has made enough out of the Dota francice to not want punish those who might be interested in a themed card game. To trully get into this game you need to pay far too much far too early 


I dont see the current pay model working very well - and will most likely why this game isn't bigger ... a bad launch can be really hard to shake for a almost mini game of WOW mini game 

Ive been playing mtg for a long time, and this is actually a pretty good take on digital mtg but it really lacks the fun and excitement. Games take forever and theres a ton of rng and there are so many things taking place at one time its hard to even figure out why you managed to win or lost or how to play a sitiuation differently or better. 

Games like this should be pay to win, following the mtg model, its a collectible card game where the goal should be to acquire the fun/cool cards. The problem is that the game is so big, that there are few individual cards that feel significantly more valuable then any others, and even fewer that have significant "cool" factor to them. 

Its not a bad game, but it has nothing to make me wanna play more currently. Too little fun for the time and cost. Its not satisfying to play and requires a ton of learning, money, and time to get anything out of.  I think they will turn it around in the future, valve is a top tier game company, but right now it feels like a big dissapointment.
The biggest mistake of my gaming life was buying $50 pack right after I start playing this game.
If I wasnt received this game for free, I will also complain that first $20 :D
No ability to chose where untis go, sometimes they attack diagonal units, sometimes they go straight ahead. No clue why. Some cards feel crazy OP and some feel worse than useless. Some cards are just unfair (like a 50% chance to survive lethal)
Lots of hype for this game, I played tons of HS and now MTGA and was excited to try this out. The mechanics are fun, but get kind of boring. Free phantom draft is nice, but there is no sense of progression unless you sink more money. Constructed is like 2 expensive decks, fun if you wanna see the same 3 heroes in a row. The three lanes is a nice concept, but sucks to watch on a stream, hurting any e-sport chance this game might have had. I had put some money in to buy cards for constructred, but a few days after launch, I sold everything to break back to being down just the cost of the game. Prices started to plummet after that. Some people might enjoy this game, but I'm not one of them. In its current form, I'd stay clear of this game. It isn't anywhere near HS or MTGA or even Eternal to be honest.
Everything is rng, you can lose all 3 heroes on turn 1 and get five 6 mana cards in ur hand. There is no redraw and you have no impact on turn 1.
There is no real balance between heroes, there are good heroes and there are trash ones. The same goes for the cards
Constructed costs money to play viably and drafts are entirely dependent on luck, if the enemy draws 3 lunas in draft you just lose the game and none of your choices mattered.
In order to get more cards you either have to buy card packs or pay a fee to enter an arena type system which is Constructed ( which requires you to have cards already bought ), phantom draft which costs around 1$ a ticket, and keepers draft which is a whopping 15$, which is a phantom draft where you get to keep the cards you draw.
I can easily say keepers draft is the easiest to win because people puddle for expensive cards which are often spread around 4 colours, but even then there is no reliable way to get cards outside of continously spending money.
Don't bother buying, you can buy the game and sell every card you get in order to patch that dent you just made in your wallet, but what you're left up with is a pile of shit that will anger you, just don't
So this game should be called "Lottery"

You pay $20 to play the lottery, test your luck.

Valve's headed in the right direction, but the game is still based on luck. Good luck new players.
You get your last free boosters at level 16. If you don't get better by then, it's back to the same Artifact when it first released.

(I just want to make a joke where I don’t say anything about the game to reflect that state that valve has us in but I can’t without explaining it.)
The fucking worse card game out there. How the fuck can you start a game with all the rng and then one of ur blue hero got laning with a fucking red hero and 2 fucking creeps? Was this game an other rngstone with the cancer casino mage or smth like that ? Where is the strategy Gabe told us that we will have ? DONT PLAY THIS GAME, GO PLAY MTG INSTEAD.
And then the fucking pay to play system. I dont mind throwing some grands into a good game like doto, but this is trash. A fucking cheap rip off milk cow. 
Will refund this game immidiately
Coming from hearthstone & also shadowverse (mainly), this card game is pretty different. I would say there are definitely alot of strategy due to how the game is split into 3 lanes which in my opinion is very in-depth. I was very skeptical about this and also excited at the same time but to my dismay Valve did not implement a way to gain cards for free even after the $20 USD ($26.99 CDN) intial entry fee which is to buy the game. I know that there is a market place and being able to gain cards is a way to reflect what real world TCG would translate into a digital economy (essentially buying cards from other people or trading with other people). I also know that there is an expert draft ($1 per ticket entry fee) which is like arena in hearthstone where you have to win at least 3 or more games to gain back your ticket and 1-2 packs with it. I also know that there is a way to play for free by phantom drafting casually but as every card game out there I play constructed ranked but this game limits me by having the upkeep cost of buying packs or going through the marketplace.

I do hope that they will add a way to at least gain packs for example daily quest or even weekly quest but it might ruin the marketplace economy and that is me just being selfish on what I want as a person who usually plays these card games for free. I cannot recommend this game unless you are willing to pay more than the $20 dollars initially and with every expansion/new cards that will come along in the future or you are a big fan of TCG and need a fresh game in the genre.
Casually it's great and I really like this game, I love the mechanics, I love the voiceovers and the animations and it's just charming but however, In a competitive sense I don't fully recommend this game right now. It's almost Impossible to have a veriety,  Because the only cards you need to know or own are red cards over the fact that they have really solid spells and the only overpowered hero in the game. Most of the other red hero's can also one shot almost 70% of the other hero cards that aren't red with base damage and survive because they also have a high health pool. With that said, It limits your options quite a lot because they are a MUST for front lines in early game, and that becomes even more true if your opponent is wise. 

In summary, there are specific cards that just don't have an immediate check unless you own the same ones or buff and condemn them and by the time you have the mana for a condemn spell and buff your cards it's just too late because your opponent is already running a tight ship right away just buffing away on already powerful cards. 

Hopefully in the future expansions there will be a solution to create more diversity or an update to nerf some things, they definately need it. I will definately change my review If things smooth out
I really cannot tell if I like this game, or because I spent money on it if I am trying to feel better about this purchase. Because of how much this is a pay-to-win game, you'll basically see a lot of he same cards beating you if you don't have them. There's counters, but it's a struggle while your opponent has a lot less of bad time. Axe is big in this way, being such a high damage and high health hero that you'll just flail hopeless against him.

Because this is more of a money printing application for Valve than an actually balanced game, supposedly, they will not nerf or balance cards. On my last run of games, after I did fairly well with my deck vs. some bots (losing no lanes in a streak) but getting completely curbed by human players, I am left unsure if I actually find this game fun at all.

If you are on the fence, wait at least a year. This game has promise; I like the lanes' complexity that the core card games tend to lack, but the game is direly needing balance and pro-community options.
This game is the definition of p2w. Pay for game, pay for cards (which cannot be grinded) or you can buy 10 random cards which will worth nothing. People are taking minutes for 1 movement for literally nothing (pure waste of time).
I have no motivation at all other than getting that one expensive card to sell it. Unlike hearthstone, you havae ranking system that rewards you. and spending money is not an option in that game even though you arent that good in the game. However in artifact, unless the RNG god is with you, and you have ton of experience and skill playing card games, you will need money to improve you deck.
I played hearthstone, MTG Arena & Paper and this game failed to getting me somewhere clicked when i played card games. The mechanic just boring, long and exhausting. Trading value is getting worse everyday, to get meta deck you should spend again more $$$. This game just finished.
Besides the microtransaction, Can we solve the connection problem? out of the 4 games i have played, 3 is stopped due to dc.
Can we have a reminder that tells you to pass turns even when you are look at other lane? It happens all the time when you finish your move and look away from the current lane.
NIce game with good mechanics, the only problem is the features are very limited. Plus the games last very long and sometimes seem very RNG dependant. Can't recommend it for now.
I bought Artifact before it got officially launched. I support it from minite 1 and didnt have the expectationfor it to be a Hearthstone "killer" BUT this game is trash, even after the 1st round of nerfs its an unbalanced mess (in my opinion) and some of its key mechanics are so fucking dumb and make 0 sense. I would 100% not recommend the game right now.
This is my first review but i feel as though i need to talk.  First of all i paid my 20 bucks which i wouldnt say is a bad thing if it was a good game.  I have played a bunch of card games and am a fan of mobas, so this should be the best of both worlds right, wrong!  I played the starting tutorial which didn't explain all that much at all. The game gives you a couple common level heroes and once you open your packs the game is unavailable for a refund.  In the packs i recieved duplicate of hero cards that are given to every one for free in the beginning. Did i mention you can only have 1 copy of each hero card?  So they actually have cards that noone can use in a pool of packs that people have to spend cash on which should be a crime.  so after i opened my packs i decided to sell all the duplicates i couldnt use, even at day 1  i had about 30.  for me to recieve 1 cent i had to sell them for .03 because steam takes .01 and artifact takes .01 minimum.  Since the majority of cards are common, steam and valve are going to make a killing because of the $1.00 i made i got to keep .33 cents.  Now onto gameplay, you start the game and it puts the heroes you picked in random locations in random lanes.  It prioritizes in front of the enemy but once those spots are filled then it randomly picks a spot to the immediate left or right.  Then when you attack you have a 50% chance to attack forward and if noone is there you have a chance to attack the tower or a random chance to target a neighboring enemy.  None of this is explained well in the intro either.  I encountered multiple bugs in my first 5 games.  Some heroes are rediculously overpowered so you can spend $20.00 on a card that has 7 attack 11 health and cleave and fight against a guy w a 2/8 in the base game whos ability is to come back faster after he dies.  Everytime someonething dies it gives the opponant gold which can cause a snowballing effect like in DOTA.  So, while your managing 3 lanes of randomness and feeling like every match you play is an uphill battle you never give up because there is the chance you can win because of RNG.  Every game i lost i felt like i was losing and the game i won i felt like i barely made it out alive and was stressed out.  after all of that i had 0 to show for it because unless you enter cash gauntlets you have nothing to show for all of your hard work.  That is exactly what it feels like, work.  I want to like it, i really do, but i just can't currently.  maybe after another 20 hrs of playing it will grow on me, but do i really want to spend 20 more hours on something when i have no sense of accomplishment, i dont see any reward, and it feels like work...
Game is fun and quite complex though I don't like the randomness of how hero and creep attack. I give negative because I simply cannot progress anymore since I can't really pay for ticket and packs.
20$ paywall.
U have to pay for cards in the constructed.
No ladder.
No proper progression.
U cant trade.
Game is not fun.
0 marketing from the Valve.
A lot of unnecessary RNG.
I was pretty lucky tbh with the random packs, got queue against 3 metadecks with more or less 25$ value minimum and one with like 35-65$ maximum, they already played not just the tutorial.
the game is fun, the nonrewarding and people upset because they dont let refund after seeing the scam is obvious.
valve what are u doing, bring a chance to your community to grind packs.
anyways, the game is fun to play, the unique problem is ppl who cant/doesnt want to spend more than the 20$ purchase at the start the game is just not fun
volvo pls fix and bring new operation cs go.
Nice mechanics and different strategies. First I thought I can go with a low budget deck, to grind free card packs up to have a good one. But you just can't get free card packs. Bullshit pay2pay game. More than just disappointed. Didn't want to believe the other bad reviews, that they say it's not possible to get free packs.
Before You Buy: You cannot earn cards by playing the game.

Important things to know:
- Upon purchasing the game you are given 10 packs to open and 5 event tickets. If you run out of event tickets, there is no way to get new cards without purchasing more cards or event tickets with REAL MONEY.
- The best cards are over-inflated, and you will lose to them if your initial 10 packs are not ideal.

Competitive Players: If you have any desire to be competitive you will have to spend money.
- There is no ladder today, and while they may be working on it, you will have no understanding of where you rank until it is released.
NOTE: If you win an event 3-2 you earn an event ticket, but this means you have to have 60% win rate on average in order to trade positively in event cards. You have to go 4-1 in order to earn new card packs, which is an 80% win rate.

Parents: This is not a $20 buy, there will be tail purchases for your kids and you will be spending far more than anticipated.

TCG Veterans: If you have played card games for years and are used to shelling out hundreds for the new, meta cards then this is no different. The only difference you'll find here is you cannot trade cards, you have you buy them.

All-in-all the game looks cool, but is heavily underscored by the lack of plausible growth and you will be over it 8 hours later when you have run out of event tickets and you have no way of playing new cards.
There is no point in buying this game because it's just about the players buying tons of card packs - which are expensive and more important than in any other card game.

There's no progression, almost no gameplay, no ranks, no market(can't even buy a good card)... Feels like a half-@ssed indie project.
不让退款，我只玩了教程1小时。游戏时间过长，我没那么多集中的时间打这款游戏。而且我没有把卡卖到Steam市场，10包不是送的么？没有卖卡，只玩了1小时都不给我退款。
所以我最后只能选择把卡卖了回点儿本。以后凡是这个公司的游戏，我再也不玩了。
Game Artifact：I only played the tutorial, only played for an hour (the tutorial is 1 hour) and found that the game is not suitable for me, a game time is too long, I do not have so much time. I hope I can get a refund.
Moreover, the card packs in the game were sent, which was not explained before. Besides, I am not a businessman. I did not get the card packs for sale at Steam Market.
So, if I don't get a refund, I just pay for the lesson? What's the difference between this and fraud?！
I applied for five refunds, none of them. I had to sell cards to reduce losses. I'll never play your game again.
I liked the gameplay but the game feels like it's missing something. Hoping that more game modes come out instead of having to shell out money to do anything other than quick matches. 

Also buying cards isnt too bad you can focus on making the deck you want to play instead of opening packs.
I cannot recommend the game in the current state.

Even if I ignore the monetisation that I don't like there are many problems, and the game feels more like early access.

My main pain points are:

- too many unbalanced cards
- quite a lot of RNG
- no progression system
- no reward system
- weak social system
It's more tedious than most card games.  The drafting process absolutely sucks because you end up with a 3-4 colors and really weak heroes a lot of times.  Honestly the overall RNG is worse than Hearthstone.
Good framework. The card store is a mess. No progression to get "free cards". The turn system is annoying and the A.I., not even to mention real players, take too fucking long to make a decision. Too many "gotcha moments", the phases are all messed up and don't make sense. The back and forth between the action and combat phases are annoying as fuck.


Nice try Valve, but you need to go back to the drawing board and come up with a fix.
Yup, this game is a complete failure. No part of it was worked out well, from the 3-lane gameplay to the frustrating hero mechanic, none of it feels fun to play. Add to that a terrible monetization scheme where any decent deck will cost tons of money, and you've got a 99% player drop in mere weeks.

Now we know why Valve doesn't make games anymore.
I really liked this game. Everything about it I enjoyed. Unfortunately there is no community, no progression, and no reason to play. I am very disappointed, I thought this could have been a great game. If Valve can turn it around I would love to come back to this game.
Games are 1 hr long half of which is just waiting for your opponent. Drafting is restrictive and limits you to one hero pick every 'pack'. Game is skillful and deep, but to the point where it is not fun. Classic garfield design.

Event rewards are awful. Packs are expensive, and ability to "sell" is restricted to steam wallet. Play HS, MTGA, Gwent or basically any other game. Artifact is for people who have lots of time and want to be competitive. Having played every TCG out there, I would bet on this game dying really fast.
is it a TCG or a CCG?  no one knows anymore lol

if you want to buy a casual card game this isnt likely the one.  you cant earn free cards like you can in other games.  the amount you can earn is limited.  meaning you have to buy the rest off of the market or from packs.  so if you wanted a CCG, this likely isnt the best choice on a limited budget.

originally this game made you buy all the cards.  this gave the cards value.  this has changed with the introduction of account levels and free packs from certain thresholds.  if you were interested in a TCG this change just killed that aspect.  all those players who bought the game now will return, get their free cards, sell them off driving prices down, and leave again once there is no more free stuff to gain.  of course there is this delusion that will get people playing in larger numbers and it will for a time, but after the well runs dry of free goodies it will return to the state it was in that prompted this change.

overall this means that eventually the game will be f2p, but it isnt yet.  currently it fails to be a f2p ccg or a p2p tcg and is withering somewhere in the middle.

its a shame too because the game is solid, fun, with some new ideas.  i like the game a lot in fact but the model at the moment reeks of a lack of identity.  investing in cards at this time is foolish as valve has proven they cant be trusted in terms of the cards values.  just wait, in about a month all the cards will be worth pennies at most and you can buy a collection rather cheap if valve doesnt take the marketplace access away and force you to gamble on packs.
Don't buy this game, casual play is utterly pointless. There's nothing to feel like you're achieving anything or working towards something. It's a stagnant mess

Sold all my cards i got from started packs. Got $20 AUD for them. Strongly recommend selling your cards and playing phantom draft mode olny. Feel like the game was worth the revised price after selling cards. $7 for the game isn't so bad. But $27 is a fucking rip off
I really like the gameplay. It's unique and makes RNG less of an issue. While RNG it is still a significant factor in your games it's no where near rngstones level. The only downside is the way Valve presented Artifact and how the player base has evaporated in just one month. Valve has also been silent on the 98% drop in player count. The future of this game probably won't see the end of the year. It's a great game but not worth picking up unless Valve makes substantial changes.
i really really didnt like it. its very complicated and its obvious that if im gonna do any good at this game i need to buy cards on the steam marketplace to compete which.... i dont really want to do i guess? 

Sorry Valve. i think im over my card game phases in my life. i mean Magic, pokemon, and Hearthstone, kinda beat you to the punch as far as influencing my taste in card games. Adding cute little dragons to an overly complicated mess doesnt make it fun. 

One last note please just do half life 3. if you do i swear ill never look at games on the Epic game store! I PROMISE!
Opened 20 packs, and have 5 packs of duplicates, 25% duplicates, so, you know how bad it is.
NO REFUND, don't buy unless you are 75% commited

TCG
the cost to play is around $180 for now
so no, go get some other games

and no refund, it did not warn you:
ABOUT THIS GAME
THE CARD GAME REIMAGINED
A collaboration between legendary card game designer Richard Garfield and Valve, Artifact is a digital card game that combines deeply-strategic, competitive gameplay with the rich setting of Dota 2. The result is an immersive and visually-stunning trading card game unlike any other.

STRATEGY UNBOUNDED
Wield your deck across three lanes of combat, answer every move of your opponent with one of your own. Unlimited hand size. Unlimited number of units you control. Unlimited mana you can employ. 

It’s up to you to decide the best way to navigate the constantly shifting tide of battle.

FUN WITH FRIENDS
If you’ve played card games around a kitchen table, you know the enjoyment that can come with house rules. Artifact allows you and your friends complete control in creating a tournament. Simply select your elimination or non-elimination format and deck constraints; then, challenge your friends to a crucible of your own design.

COMPETE GLOBALLY
Want to test your skill against the world at large? Valve-sponsored gauntlets and tournaments will give players the opportunity to not just play Artifact for the joy of mastery, but to win prizes based upon their level of play.
It's a decent well thought out card game. But its Pay 2 Play, Pay 2 Win, & Pay 2 do anything. Your $20 won't remotly give you enough cards to start with.

You can't earn anything in game, everything is for real money, single key cards sell for $36, there's no ranking, no leauge, no rewards.

This is one of the worst games for micro transactions besides maybe Dungeon Keeper Mobile.

I'll edit this review if it changes, but as of review its like a bad mobile game.

There are just as good, if not better online card games out there that give you so much more, and are even intialy free. Hearthstone, & Magic Arena (made by the same project lead) to name just two.

The way this game has been handled makes me slightly worried about Steam as a platform, and where it may go.
For a game in several years in development, it is still very incomplete (at current stage). The game needs more features such as chat and ranked mode. Do not buy this game if you only plan to pay the Initial payment and would want to play constructed mode. There are no in-game reward except fun(?).


Make 1v1 Draft a thing, Gabe.
Rly nice game enjoyed it for 1 day . But now i need to put more money for tickets or packs and i dont want to.. Sadly that this game will die soon if Valva dont doo something about getting tickets or packs with ingame curency or on daily basic cus atm this game its more pay2win that any other....
The expense of the game is a negative for sure but really the issue I have is that matches depend way too much on random luck.  In other existing card games there are typically two sources of randomness  - the cards you happen to draw out of those in your deck and card random effects.  Artifact has many more areas of randomness 

creeps placement in lanes
creature attack directions
items from the secret shop during the shop phase

Its a huge amount of randomness that to me just doesn't feel fun.  

On the plus side the game seems well made and I didnt encounter any bugs.
Kind of bummed by Artifact. Came from MTG expecting a good experience, and while the game is pretty and the core gameplay interesting, there are factors at play that make it a bad time to join. Initial fee is not worth it, which has been beaten to death by now. The game is poorly optimized for lower spec players like myself (I can barely run the menu without my system chugging), and the RNG elements are awful. Maybe there's hope for this game a few years for now but it doesn't feel like Valve is listening or supporting the community, and I bought in expecting differently. Major bummer; I feel had.
BUYER BEWARE!!! 

   As soon as you open your free packs you cannot refund the game. These are the only free cards you get otherwise you have to use actual money to buy more. There is literally zero other ways to get cards despite the game already being $20. This game is nothing but a cash grab from Valve and its sickening. I've been a fan for over a decade but it seems even the best companies fall to this era of microtransactions and shady tactics. 

   The biggest thing is it is a fun game, its unique and different. Its comprised of three lanes complete with random movements, a shop to buy items in, constant effects in lanes, quick spells, and so much more. The game looks fantastic as well, its polished with a bunch of fun animations and voice lines. The board and outer sceanery as a whole envlopes you into the game and makes you not want to put it down. 
 
   All of this effort is wasted however due to the aforementioned issues and lack of refund due to their "policy". The only place this policy is shown, atleast from what Ive seen, is within the games store page under system requirements. Tucked away in small grey font So they can state its clearly stated when its so easily overlooked I thought it to be part of the copyright text under every game. 

   I really wanted to love this game but with Valves underhanded tactics I cannot reccomend or support this game in any way, shape, or form.
There is nothing to achieve in this game.
If you want to play competitive you have to spend a lot of money.
The game itself seems good, but i cant recommend this business model.
If you want to spend lot of money and collect cards or play casual a card game without achieving anything then this game is for you.
General boring game that rely alot on RNG, building decks seems to be punishing you if you try to go for more than 2 colors or i found single color decks the strongest, which limit the options of how to play the game 10' fold. would not recommend this game.
too many random elements to the point where the game is just frustrating.

My unit has 15 attack and could kill their tower? Nope, lets target this 2hp creep instead! What a joke.
Sadly I've expected so much more from this game... They had so much resources and time to master it and make it a little bit more entertaining and interesting. The idea alone is pretty good however at the momemnt the game isn't offering enough to be even considered worth the money it asks for.
Never! Never ever buy this game. Why?
Are you ready to spend another $25 EACH DAY for in-game purchases?

You can't win any real battle with cards you receive.
Real battle means those where you can receive other cards as well. Win at least 4 of 5 games with your sh*tty card packs. Try, ha!
Other way of getting them is paying. That's it.

You either ready to spend here money everyday or you lose.
Choise is yours

Good luck
I would like to say so far I enjoyed the gameplay aspect of it and it was fun. So here are my pros and cons:

Pros:
1) Very different playstyle than hearthstone, magic or gwent
2) Deck building is fun, and playing requires alot of strategy from card placement to buying cards 
3) No grind for cards (i guess its also a con) o
4) I like that valve listened and added a free casual mode to practice decks
5) You can spectate friends and watch the game

Cons:
1)  Assembling decks or staying competitive costs alot of money. It costs around $200 plus to completely get all the cards (not that its needed, but its kinda helpful if u switching up the decks and wanna try new playstyle). It still costs $50-100 bucks to still have a competitive deck
2) It is a paid game (yes you pay to get into the game) and it isnt rewarding enough. To get rewarded you need to pay or buy tickets (which cost real money) to play arena etc. I dont think this game will go far if it does not do anything about ways to get ticket other than recycling cards (which again requires you to buy the cards in the first place).
3) The idea you dont need every card is fine, but it is annoying because I rather be spending time playing the game thing worrying about which cards to sell or buy to make my deck and if i sell i a card am i making a mistake etc
4) The game can be unforgiving in terms of rng sometimes if the card placement early on is bad and also it just seems that it will burn you out.
5) No way to spectate games other than friends games, I would like to see the ability same as dota 2 but right not its not there

I really hope they do make other ways other than recycling to earn tickets, cap the pricing on cards as I can see pricing inflation making the game worse. I did enjoy the game, its fun and addicting, but there is too many cons at this time for me to say its long term prospect is worse than hearthstone or magic. Cheers
Arbitrarily too hard and dense.
Not enough cards to balance the gameplay with both constructed and draft formats.
Draft is tilted too hard towards getting the best cards in the set.
Gameplay is very swingy and hard to win any match, even when you think you are winning.
Presentation is basic.
No instruction on what makes a good deck or what is a good strategy for the individual cards.
There are combo synergies that will blow out an opponent without them being able to do anything about it.
Randomness of card placement combined with randomness of drawing cards per round make games difficult to pull back from a poor hand.  In fact, poor draws out of the players control can determine which player will win the game.
Built-in monetary system is predatory and built specifically for those players with high win-rates.
2 Tickets and 5 Packs is crazy expensive for the casual player to buy into the prizing structure.
Tickets and Packs have to be purchased from seperate in-game screens.
Purchasing cards from the marketplace is easy, selling is easy.
At 100ish hours played, this game is even more random, difficult, money investment driven than Magic: The Gathering.
No physical cards can be redeemed or purchased.
LET'S PUT MONETIZATION SYSTEM ASIDE AND TAKE A LOOK AT THE GAME ITSELF.

Card design is REALLY POOR.

It has a lot of cards that are just NOT FUN, NOT INTERESTING, NOT INTERACTIVE for both players.

Mass silence, stun, instant hero kills, instant mass dmg to tower, destroy everything etc.
These mechanics just stop you from doing anything.

And this card  "CHEATING DEATH" a.k.a. Coinflip Fest. Omfg design of this is so lazy and stupid.

Btw these are strongest cards in the game, so you'll get them a lot.

It has SHITTIEST BALANCE. Difference between power levels of cards is fkng insane.
After decades of playing MTG, Pokemon, YuGiOh, and a few years at Hearthstone, I can safely say that this game in its current state is the worst card game ever produced. 
The balance is way off, the core mechanics are poorly concieved and unlike Hearthstone, you don't seem to be able to earn packs in game unless you play the ranked mode with consecutive wins. 
The gameplay is very convoluted and I found myself immediately frustrated by the lack of explaination of concepts, and the off the wall mechanics. 
You can't even trade the cards with friends! You can only sell them and be subject to Valves 15%+ fee. 
Sadly, I feel like it will end up like Gwent and have no one playing it. 

Fix this game and prove me wrong Valve.
Sadly I cannot recommend this game. The lack of social feature and the absence of ladder make the game extremely boring. You are under the impression of playing against bots all the game since there is not even emote to communicate with your opponent. This is a shame because the gameplay itself is actually pretty cool and innovative. I really don't mind the economic system of the game since, if you're only doing draft, you don't have to spend a penny after you buy the game. The game can be quite expensive if you're looking to play it competitively. I still think it's cheaper than others cards games like Hearthstone.
Since I'm selling all the cards I'm winning by playing draft the game is basically free if you know what you're doing, so it's pretty casual friendly. 
Maybe after a few tweaks the game can be playable but I still think that, without a ladder, I won't be playing this game  in a week.
This game is fun, but it requires you to buy each individual card in order to play on any sort of competitive level without the means of gathering cards through gameplay.

I've requested a refund but have been denied becasue I exceeded the ~2hours playtime limit which seems unfair because the game itself needs some time in order to understand how it works.
LOL. You can buy every single card of the game with money, I don't like that. I think that is a good game in general but Valve completely ruins it with these things. As everyone said, Valve aren't game developers anymore.

+PLUS: If I want to get 2 free decks and some card packs which it's called "Initial pack", I will NOT be able to request a refund through Steam. So if I want to play the game decently (multiplayer) I wont be able to refund it. Nice decision.
First of all I plan on continue updating this review as play more and more this game. 
RIGHT NOW WAIT TOO SEE IF ANYTHING CHANGES WITH THE MARKET, PACKS or GAMEMODES
IT IS A P2P GAME BUT INSIDE THE GAME YOU HAVE TO PAY 2 PLAY COMPETITIVE GAMEMODES OR STAY RELEVANT ON CONSTRUCTED.
CAN YOU SPEND A LOT OF MONEY ON THIS GAME AND ARE YOU PLANNING ON DOING IT FINE or YOU DONT HAVE THE MONEY TO CONSTANTLY PAY FOR PACKS AND TICKETS DONT BUY or just play the free pahntom arena gameode however you wont get anywhere by doing so.
Cons:
The one bad thing I really see is how your collection and gamemodes work. your are already paying for the game but really you can see that you are paying in a F2P game for what the game comes with (the 10 card packs and the 5 tickets). Since I at least now dont plan on spending money on packs or tickets (even though I spent like 30 bucks on HS). The reason is that even though you can play arena and constructed for free you dont get anything so your time converts into 0 of anything in this game, if you play the other modes that are paid with tickets you get something back and sometimes more but not that much. You could spent so much money on this game and still dont have what cards you want for a deck because the cards you are given for buying the game YOU CAN STILL GET THEM IN PACKS, why I dont know because this cards have 0 value in the future market at this moments since if you have the game you have that card so nobody will pay anything for them. I always prefered the constructed experience but I can never really see me doing that here (or back in HS) because even with like 300$ I will propably dont have all cards for the deck and even less the collection. Good cards will cost too much on the marked (or at leaste the requiered or fundamental for good decks lets say the a quarum emissary or the card for infinite mana on otk you get the point).
Some cards will be so requested on the marked that you could pay a lot for them even the cost of the game itself and others are worth 0 because everyone has them (basic set).

Basically: The marked seem great in paper but is poorly executed in conjuction with the packs. even with the marked in play you could buy a pack and then it is worth nothing if it gives you cards you already have. 
There is no reward for spending time in this game if you dont pay and play the paid gamemodes and assuming you are good enough to get a lot of wins on this gamemodes.

Pros:
The mechanics on the game feel nice it the few our that I have tried it.

I really like the game in question due to how the skill curve works on this game with a very low skill floor and super high skill celling even if there is one. The strategy of when and how to use a card, saving it, not playing something to play first next round or lane everything is nice.  Yeah there is some rng with some cards and positioning but it does really feel that it you lost purely on rolls because even withh some bad rolls you can still win (Except on cheating death that card makes you feel bad but whatever).
I like for now playing the free arena mode because I dont have cards (and probably will never have) to play constructed but still feels fun and very skillfull on what cards you pick taking into account colors and strats because you could have a consistently average 2 color deck or a tricolor deck that could end really great or really bad on draws.

Overall nice game in design looks and gameplay but bad with its problem with money in general.


Good but having no progression or making it easier to access tournaments damages the game

They brought in tournaments but whats the point of even playing with no progression?
Money i could of spent on a kebab, would of got more enjoyment out of it
stem wouldn't refund my game under 2 hours because i bought the rerelease. They mentioned i had purchased something extra for the game (hinting at DLC it seemed, which I didn not.) Also, just play MTG....
Excellent card game, combination of the MTG elements with DOTA theme works well, the mechanics and gameplay feels deep and thought trough. But the game is facing one big issue. Valve tried to create virtual TCG here, and wanted to put real prices on cards, like MTG does. But, the keyword here is "virtual". When you buy an MTG booster pack, you can interact with the cards, let's say in a way , "feel them". That simply does not apply in virtual world. The fact that the progression in this game is at the moment nonexistent (if you don't want to spend more money on the already paid game), creates a big issue Valve needs to solve immidiately, or they will loose majority of players. So, at this moment, the game just feels empty. You play and get no rewards from playing. Can't recommend at this moment.
Pay to play, pay to win. Everithing is random. No ladder. You can not buy cards with ingame gold, only with credit card.
No ladder, no mmr. Much of the game decided buy rng, more even than in hearthstone.
Overall really bad game, and really bad player experience.
I wish i could get my money back.
This is bad; where do I begin? First, TL;DR the game lacks consistent plays, you could be winning and instnatly lose to a card.

Matches
the matches are bilpolar; if you're using a bunch of red cards you need early game advantage but you have a black card that can be used on turn 1 to destroy your card you have on the field! In other words put you at a disvantage. Blue is control and to take out large crowds of creatures making the deck useful against itself and somewhat agianst red. Green is meh with trying to mana ramp and be raw simple power.

Matches will lean one way or another until the match moves throughout the game and just swing from one way to another with you completely losing all because you didn't play the right type of cards agianst the right kind of deck. In the end you'll just lose. By all means this wouldn't be bad if the game wasn't long but if your going to have long matches THEN DON"T HAVE THEM SWING! It feels like bullshit when your trying to win and then suddenly ONE card kills the match and THEN just drags out the match LONGER this was the issue with hearthstone, I would quit the match because my opponent is just stalling so they don't lose but in the end they just lose or win by war of nutriton!

Why can my opponent instantly kill a card before the match begins? For those who don't know you can have a card that dies before the cards start their auto battle! Here is the thing, it wouldn't be as bad IF your tactics didn't rely on the blocker being dead because the damage doesn't carry over to your opponent and this causes another problem; you need to increase the number of units on the field in order to kill your opponent and oh you need to protect your heroes in order to cast cards otherwise your a sitting duck.

Well the problem is you can't protect against a spell! You cannot counter! There are no responds to save yourself from losing the match due to not being able to play cards! Then why do I have cards if I can't play the said cards? That doesn't make any sense! Your best bet is that the beginning RNG works in your favor and your deck play style! How is RNG fair to make or break a match! That doesn't make sense! I get the idea is that the game swings but then it's not like Dota 2 then!

I enjoy Dota 2 but not because of the swing but because I can run away and or respond unlike LOL; hell Dota 2 protects you against tower dive! This game doesn't, this game basically discourages you from playing cards. Your best bet only is to play a mix between black and red for the deck play style in order to win against your opponent. You have no great tactic to use to win against your opponent to be provided a slither of a chance to win against your opponent.

I could go on and on for the number of problems on this.

This is half way like Dota 2
This is kind of like Dota 2 but in other ways feel like LOL (league of legends) due to the fact that the game has dive and has a swift strong kick to face before you can see it just like LOL which is a dumb idea to do for game that wants to do swing.
Big fan of the art and game mechanic..............................
BUT its a complete scam: you need to pay upfront 18€ for the game and for every pack 1,75€ and there is very very limited room for you to win packs ingame. You need a very high persistent winrate in a draft modus to gain even anything.
Pay to play? make sense atleast for me
Pay to win? isnt every other game also the same, or just gid gud urself. suck to be sucks right?
Rng? also make sense otherwise every single game will be the same because this is card game not ur mom's game

now is my own sight why i give this game negative review

-the game is absolulately boring, it takes century to finish 1 game
-no good place to warm up like vs AI or doing story mode
-pay to play in arena? ok ok i get it, but give some daily income

now the solution
-if market was the main reason why this game weird in first place
just remove cards on market, but open the option for player to get daily income
this way atleast maintaing daily basis player base,
pretty much all their problem because cards selling in market,
if they give daily income, every cards price will be a trash like not even a cent
so takes those from the market they can make a new improvement in that kind of stuff


dont get me wrong, i play many Tcg before, but the main reason i didnt like this because its too boring like 30 min for a match in card game?
better play dota then lol
Cool game idea and gameplay, but middle-skill and low-skill gamers have not possibility to farm cards and packs(busters). Only pay-2play. Its very bad i think. In Hearthstone you can do daily missions and farm gold. There is you can not do it.
So:
+ good gameplay and gameidea
+ good graphic
- pay2play system
- game without ladder
- game without pve content

Dislike now, but i hope that Valve will fix it.
I have super mixed feelings because I can see really enjoying this game but its montezation restricts me enough that I cant enjoy it as much as I'd like to. For 20 bucks, I can't control what a deck looks like. Draft can be fun but it can also have you feeling pidgeon holed into a build that you don't like or doesn't work. All I want is a little bit of growth that I can get through playing.

Do what? Pay 20 bucks so that I can buy packs so that when the next set comes out I have to keep buying stuff to stay relevant? Buy cards where some (Axe rn)cost 15 bucks? 

All I want is a little progression so I can build fun decks to go against AI and my friends when I'm not up to drafting. Is that really so much to ask for?
This game seem to be very RNG heavy. RNG is doing more things than players themselves. Also I dont like, that Valve fee on marketplace is almost the same as cost of an actual card.
This game is very poorly optimized and playing on minimum specs is suffering. With such basic visuals it shouldnt run so poorly (funny enogh, menu runs even worse than actual game).
I wouldnt mind the BUY to BUY to PLAY model that much, if it would offer something more than other card games or something special. Unfortunately I didnt find anything special here for me.
Yes, this game is better than Hearthstone, but there are better CCGs out there.
Valve moved from selling hats in all their games to straight pay to win,

You want better cards? BUY pack or BUY cards from auction house
You dont have tickets? Buy 5 tickets for 5 euro LOL

Basically if you want to keep on playing keep on paying.
While i love dota, this differance of decks makes it very much skill based deck builds rather than actual playable skills and with people just buying their way to the best decks, it makes it incredibly frustrating to play without spending money.
I expect RNG in a card game, but this easily is the most RNG slot machine game I have ever played I don't see any competitive potential atm but it is still a decent game I would not take it serious though in this state.
I dont reccomend to buy this game until they nerf blue

Monoblue is the most expensive deck in the game and is literally broken
The easy amount of removal spells in it are too cheap and easy to pull off

Artifact is unplayable and facing monoblue makes it zero fun, cause of this u cant play expert play with any other deck, well u can but after 3 or 4 wins u will only face monoblue and wont win until u play monoblue too ....

its fuckign disgusting, it used to be a fun game and i prefered it over hearthstone but now its unplayable and im not going back to this game until they nerfed monoblue and i recommend anyone who wants to buy it wait till they nerf it.

Even if u think i talk shit   ...  the moment u got an understanding about the game lets say 30h or smth. like that u will regret not listening to me
Dota2 fans hated on LoL because of shitty pay2win and buy to play hero tactics. This game has worse price model than LoL. Didnt expect Valve to go from Dota2,CSGO to this pay2pay model. But its better than other card games, both in gameplay and payment model. So, if you have too much steam cash, go for it because gameplay is good.

This is why artifact is bad. Creep spawns into the lane and 26 f****** damage gets directed towards a 4 hp creep. Instead of me winning the game with a plan i set forth 4 turns prior I lose bc of some ridiculously bad thought process by the game developers. RNG IS NOT NECESSARY IN EVERYING SINGLE F****** FACET OF THE GAME. Competitive? Ya RIGHT. Junk game. Goes in the trash.
Deadborn CCG, don't even think to push that "Add to cart" button.
- First of all pay to play sucks. Even with 20$ price for the game you'll constantly have to pay more.
- Weak online.
- Quite often the game just refuses to give you a chance to win. E.g. there can be a draft where the same weak hero offered to you 6 times.
- Cards and heroes are totally unbalanced. No balance updates happened to address issues. E.g. we have green hero Drow Ranger with +1 damage aura and mass silence for 4 mana. And we have green hero Rix which has... Rapid Deployment and single unit silence for 5 mana (wtf!). Instead of balancing the game we got..... chat wheel, really?!
Straight to the point:
The game is probably fun, but I can't manage to finish an entire match.
The game keeps crashing/freezing no matter what I do.
Not related to specs/temps...
Simply can't recomment it because I am not able to play.
Will change my review once a patch comes out...
If you want to play casually for fun I think there are more suitable alternatives.
Here everyghing seems very serious and this can be stressful for some people.
The need for ongoing purchases to participate in most activities and expand your decks (and hence, game variety and fun) can be intimidating. 
There is casual play but it is just isolated matches without a sense of progression or well defined goals. As a lone player you probably won`t be able to enjoy features such as tournaments and will probably get stomped if you try to play competitively. The casual game modes feel like they are intended just as ways to train free of charge before jumping in more serious, paid game modes, not as ways to enjoy the game casually.
Pay to win, yeah lots of cards are cheap but the cards that easily synergize and are op are very expensive. The argument can be made other combos are capable of contending but only if you get the right combo in a rng card draw. get real
i wish this game wasn't terrible.
its a complete money pit u have to pay a dollar to play the best mode in the game which is draft, if u get 3 wins u get ur dollar ticket back..... there's no way to get more tickets u just get ur ticket back what a complete joke literally the only game i've played where its 100% negative EV, u either get ur money back or u lose, like come on there needs to be a way to get more tickets .
This game not support color blind people like me, I literaly can't built deck because they seperate everything with color scheme so it made this game unplayable for me.

So if u are a color blind please hold your thought and wait till this game really care about us.

Extremely unbalanced game in Constructed, not fun at all. 
Lacks basic features, no spectating, no social-features, no progression.
Draft is fun for a bit, if you are really into draft it could be worth inital cost to play the free draft mode, Otherwise dont bother.
FK STEAM. WON'T LET ME REFUND BECAUSE I OPENED THE CONTENT THEY GAVE ME WHEN I FIRST OPENED THE GAME.....
THIS IS A SCAM. DO NOT BUY YOU CANNOT REFUND
Pre-ordered this one since I'm hooked onto Dota 2 and have always been interested in the TCG/CCG genre but never really got into Hearthstone, Clash Royale, Yu-Gi-Oh, PTCG or MTG. All of those had some thing that turned me off, whether it was the cards being hard to acquire/behind a paywall. And I'm sad to say that this one was no different. I am not talking about the price of the card packs(2 USD per pack is pretty reasonable tbh) or the initial price of the game(10 packs + 5 tickets come to around 25 USD, you get these for 20 as well as a free month of Dota+). The problem lies in the fact that there are no other ways to get additional cards other than paying. You cannot earn additional cards just through gameplay contrary to what the other games mentioned above allow. The ONLY ways to earn cards are either through competitive mode(called Expert play) which require tickets to take part in or buying the packs. There is no return for somebody who spends the initial 20 USD and doesn't get lucky with the card packs, meaning that to have a chance at the top levels you need to buy more packs. This alone makes it hard to recommend it to other people since the people who are able to spend money on it will still spend it to get those rare cards, but those who are barely able to afford the base game will end up regretting a purchase after seeing the monetization/business model of the game.

Now the game does have positives. Possibly inspired from Clash Royale trying out a 2 lane system, the 3 lane system based on Dota 2 allows for complex play and intricate strategies. Deciding which lane to give up and which lanes to put your firepower into is crucial since destroying the tower in 2/3 lanes gives you the win. However it is also possible to take the enemy ancient after taking down its tower without needing to worry about the other 2 lanes so one cannot turn a blind eye to a lane in all the cases. The concept of hero and card color depending on mana(similar to Clash Royale and Hearthstone) as well as item cards and gold adds another depth of complexity into the game. There are draft modes where you will be able to get a feel for certain cards if you are able to draft them allowing you to test out the card before a potential purchase. 

If the game just changes it to allow card drops even outside of competitive play which requires tickets and instead offers additional rewards to ticket users (sort of how battle cups work in Dota 2) then this game could easily breeze past the competition and become the top tcg out there.
TLDR at the bottom

[h1]Pros:[/h1]

Its one of the most complex card game in the market that require some effort to learn the mechanics, once you get the jiz of it its very fun to play, the learning didn't just stop there, if you want to win consistenly, you will need to learn how to predict opponent moves, mind games, efficient resource management, optimal play order ect...

Most polished card games out there, each cards have their own voice line, some cards have unique voice line interaction if play with another cards, this game flesh out more DotA lore by each card having backstory written and voice acted.

Free draft mode is a fun game mode for begineers to learn the games. Please dont be me wasting ticket on expert, free draft is a good stepping stone to learn before playing expert since expert mode have alot of experience player.

The monetization model are fine, there seems to be alot of people having trouble accepting the concept of having to pay for games but i digress. If you want to expand your card collection, I HIGHLY recommend buying cards in steam market instead of opening packs, buying or recycling cards for ticket is also a good way to earn packs too if you have more experience. The value of buying 3 copies of every single cards + one copy of each heroes in the market are around 350 dollars at early december, opening packs have the same expected value.

I played over 6k hours on DotA2, Hearthstone from closed beta untill Karazhan expension, 200 hours on close and open beta Gwent, between these 3 companies i prefer the way Valve managing multiplayer games, CDPR have good business model but very inexperience, Blizzard is really slow on implementing community requested features and instead of nerfing overpower cards, they just change overpowered cards into unplayable state. Valve can be secretive, but they seems to get important things done in a timely matter.

Game have alot of potential when more card sets being introduce down the line, i assume there will be events and free draft mode to play their new cards.

[h1]Cons:[/h1]

Currently lack of mmr / ladder system, valve release statement they are currently working on it so this cons might be short live.

Feature incomplete on day one such as battle log, player statistic, proper spectating mode, draft mode with friends.

The upfront $20 barrier of entry come with 2 starter decks, 10 packs and 5 tickets, with no way to "grind" for cards,  grinding might be part of the expeirence some players seek.

This game can be a pain to learn, because artifact game mechanics are not obvious/straight fowards like HS/Gwent, so you might just make sub-optimal plays without knowing it, the biggest example is hero dying is not a bad things at all, if you die at the right timing, you could relocate your resources to other lane that need it, mobility is a luxury in this game. Initiative mechanic is also not obvious for new players.

You cant play this game while watching videos/movies , this game require your full attention to play optimally.

All cards aren't created equal, constructed mode can get expensive since cards like axe and drow are expensive and for good reason, they have superior stats and impactful spell compare to other cards. You still could succeed and have fun in constructed without these expensive cards but in most cases if you want a consistent and optimize deck, you might as well bite the bullet.

Steam market can be confusing to navigate for newcomers, if you want to sell or buy cards at an optimal prices, you need to navigate between in game store and steam overlay, manually changing price. It can get tedious really fast.


[h1]TLDR:[/h1]

Artifact is the most engaging card games I've ever played, however the more I play the more I find out the cons outweight the pros, the ticket system kills the game for me, in other card games, you want to play, just queue rank games and boom, you are matched with people that are equal skill most of the time; however in Artifact those free game modes are just full of people concede when they got minor disadvantage, that means if you want to play against opponent that at least trying to play, you need to cough up a ticket which will cost you money or steam credit.
While this game really is fun to play. It is simply a money grab. Many other card game titles are fun as well and do not cost nearly as much by comparison. Comparison's aside, Afrtifact costs quite a hefty coin from your pocket along with neccesary purchases with real life currency to buy more cards. Yes you can get a few packs by playing (a shit ton i'd add) the game, but, this only amasses to a few cards, nothing to build even a decent deck out of. As much as this game deserves a better review, to any others looking for something new to try out, there are other games just as good that will keep you hooked and playing daily without demanding for you to hand over cash. Thumbs down for me, sadly.
I loved this game when it came out, mostly because it's easily the most challenging and fun TCG I've ever played. Honestly, the game mechanics and things you can do are just amazing. I also loved the fact that I didn't have to listen to my opponent and could just focus on the game.

Then things all changed when they added ways to communicate with your opponent.

What is the #1 reason that I will quit playing (or not even start playing) a game? Toxic community. The a**holes all complained that there was no way to smack talk your opponents, so Valve caved in and gave them a way to do it. Sure, you can silence someone, but you have to see them say something before you can click the mute button. So if they play a move ensuring they win and say something gloatful, silencing them "for the rest of the game" is just dumb.

If I want to play a game full of a-holes who trash talk, CS has a great community for that. Hell, even their flagship game (Dota 2) is full of them. But I choose not to play those games.

Another big complaint is that it's P2W. However, --ALL-- TCGs are P2W if you want rewards for playing. There are plenty of ways to play Artifact without spending extra money. So that argument isn't exactly the strongest. Also, a full set of cards in the set can be purchased on the market for under $100 now I think? Possibly a lot less. The highest priced cards are all less than $5 each now, and the highest price non-hero (meaning you can have up to 3 in a constructed deck) card is $3.34 (as I'm writing this). This means that for $10.02 you can have the maximum amount of the most expensive card. Compare that to other TCGs. Most other TCGs have single cards selling for way more than $10 each, let alone having to get (4) of that given card.

TLDR: toxic game community. WAY too many a**holes.

Unless you're into that sort of thing, then I guess you could call this a recommendation.
It has an appealing appearence, but once you start playing, you realise that it has the same issues as Dota 2 which it is based on.

Every part of this game is about OP cards.
You have the strongest cards? There's no real need for strategy, you just get rekt.
You can't know what cards you opponent will have so you can't counter his deck, you just build you deck with the most OP cards you have. In the end, the one who win is the one with the strongest cards (like diminishing the damage of all the opponent heroes in the fountain, do it twice and your opponents heroes will end up with 1 or 2 damage.)

There's no balance in this game. Every card aims to make heroes OP, the creeps are mostly worthless and there's too much randomization to actually use them. (which enemy they'll attack and which lane they'll land into).

It started with a nice idea of turning the complex card games like Magic, into something simple with fewer cards to put into your deck (and fewer combinaisons) but it ended up as a complete Opness competition. No matter how good you are, your opponent can completely crush you if he has the OP cards you don't.
DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF:

you are looking for a 'deck building' game. If you want to build a deck, you HAVE to pay money to get the packs. The only way to play is either via the free modes, which limit you to the cards you get from your first 10 free packs, or via 5 free tickets you receive. If you are not skilled enoguh to win enough with these 5 tickets, your free ride to extra packs ends. You are then forced to buy either tickets, packs or cards directly, which is a scummy business practice.

I would warn you to stay away until these issues are adressed or to play if you don't mind this. As it stands, I cannot reccommend the game.
You have to purchase the game. Then you have to purchase more cards. Why is it not free to play?! Why am i paying twice how fucking greedy are you?! Either purchase the game or purchase the cards not both!
Pros: 
Nice and crispy UI
Plenty of different gamemodes to play
One card per "mini-turn" mechanic
Multiple victory conditions
Separate resource in form of gold

Cons:
Monetization
Deckbuilding
RNG
Very little card comboes...
... and deckbuilding options
Very little depth...
... and game tries to make up for it by overwhelming user with massive amount of things happening at once
Terrible monetization and the rng is not fun. If this was free maybe I could understand ,but valve scared off many streamers already with its bad monetization and some crappy game mechanics. I would not recommend.
There is no in game currency and all cards have to be bought with real money. Not only is that exploitive but it also means there is no incentive to keep playing.
Without a doubt, the single worst card game I have ever come across. This game is so unbelievably badly balanced you would think icefrog was involved in some way. I love DotA lore as much as the next guy, but this game is a shameless, poorly executed cash grab.
The game has no way of earning cards whatsoever without paying real money, on top of the original £20 price tag. Even a decent player will need to buy new tickets at least once a week, assuming they play for about 10 hours/week. The game modes are unimaginitive, the cards are poorly designed and the variety between is essentially non-existant. 
Nobody should buy this game, it is literally pay to win in the worst possible way.
This game should be titled "The Lord of the Cards; One Card to rule them all -Credit card will be your Strongest Card Ever" It is expected that when you buy something youll get something 100% satisfactory,  Or unless they put the strongest Bot like OpenAI and enable OFFLINE Mode + all cards enabled and only those who will go ONLINE will have the Premium pass to gwt to use their server ( thats the only time you will feel that you owned ARTIFACT.)  this time VALVE Owned you and your credit card WiLL RULE THEM all if you have one. This is rcommended only for thos who want to be  a spoon feeder for valve.. that is why they are not putting yet SKILL ranking. like MMR for for DOTA 2. Skill ranking will tell you if you are really a skilled one not the "My Credit Card Rule Them All Ranking style of the survival of the fittest. For now those who have bought this you are alll ARTIFUCKED Up... Ecpectations versus reality eats you like Leech....
Already bought 20$, still can't get a free pack
MTG arena is free, and we can easily get pack without paying

This is as bad as diablo immortal and fallout 76
First negative on steam:
50% off just after two weeks of "open beta"
Are you treating us who bought this game before this as dumba**?
Discount for a TCG game is ridiculous.
Let's see how the prices of cards go. 
Iff we get any sort of compensation, I will change this review.
As a player who only intends to pay for the base game, the prize play drafts are important for me. But with the reducing number of players, I don't get evenly matched opponents and that ruins the experience.

Gameplay is not rewarding at all.
What is Fartifact?
A game that u spend 20$ to buy it then u most spend 40$ more so u can have all cards u need so game be fair 
Those who work at valve are ret.arded
i tell u why
dota 2 is a team game and it is free
so ppl ruine games
gerfing and stuff and they dont care about others in thier team  u know why?
CUZ GAME IS FUCKING FREE
but Fartifact is a solo game were every thing is up to u and u only they charge u with money .
for some one from iran which a country (better say hell) with currency which worth less than shit and ppl who have job get paid 80$ per mounth is not possible to enjoy the game unless they be rich kids
if u are about to spend 100$ per year for this game , Then Go For It
cuz u gonna have fun
but if u are gonna only buy the game and only the game not cards pack on game then dont even think about it
u gonna be against players with good fucking shit cards and they win match before even u do something.
let me tell u something valve is The next bilizard 
they are greedy is fuc.k 10 times greeder than  Mr. Krabs from SpongeBob SquarePants
u give them money they Bends over
u give them a lot of money  then they give u  thier family as slave 
Go F.uck Your Self Gabe Newell
Waste of time and money, I regret spending $20 to buy this game. This game is designed to have spend money in this game unless all you do is do casual draft, you are paired with players with similar win ratio and ranking as you, so you win/loss ratio will always be near 50% no matter how skilled you are, with that being said many of the casual players have already moved on into something worthwhile, all thats left are the hardcore players/gold farmers. 

This game has only came out recently and already have had a 90% decrease from peak players. Do yourself a favor and spend your hard earned money elsewhere.
this is literally a trading card game, but online, but also you have to pay an entrance fee before you can open any packs.

we literally knew this from the start and there is no excuse to bitch about that.

however, the game sucks overall. the game is far too slow to be of any fun and the mechanics seem to be designed to encourage counters and prevent any lead-building to artificially force "outplays" in the form of singular cards.

another issue is that rng is far too prevalent to be any fun. first you roll the dice to determine if your heroes got fucked over at the start of the game. then every turn you literally roll the dice to determine which board each creep goes to, then dice to determine where its placed on the board, and then dice once more to determine where it attacks. they might be trying to pander to the "intellectual" crowd but its just slow and fucking frustrating. 

card design initially seems interesting because each card seems to have a specific purpose or role. unfortunately that is the downfall of the game and the main reason why general purpose cards like axe, mist of avernus, blink dagger, etc are so expensive.

as it stands there is no incentive to play casual mode. there is no mmr, no achievements, no cosmetics or anything to work toward. of course these aspects don't exist in a traditional card game, but generally tcg's tend to have archetypes that make it fun even if you're on the losing side. and if your card collection is weak and you want to play the free random draft mode to save money, you will find you can redraft instantly and penalty-free so its the fucking wild west out there. casual is probably only useful if you have the money to play (like in real tcg's). you can try and fine tune a competitive deck, but i can imagine that given the average game lengths, that will require a major time investment.
 
so normal poor people like me with no time will ironically want to play ticketed modes, but constructed is off the table obviously, and keeper draft seems like way too high a price. this leaves you with the draft mode which i think they realized is so fucking rng based that they have to offer a disgustingly specialized rotation of cards that shows up every two weeks. even still its a mess because the most important aspect is heroes, which you cannot even moderately try and manipulate your chances with.

ultimately, since casual mode literally offers no sort of reward, and because just the actual game itself is so boring, i can't believe i paid any amount of money for it. and since there is no like fun single player campaign or anything attached to it, they really should have followed a hearthstone monetization system. i really would not recommend this game unless valve make drastic changes to gameplay, speed up some of the slow af animations, or turns it f2p like with tf2.
FIRST THING FIRST : If you bought the game, don't open the free packs before being sure you do not wish to resell the game. Once you've opened the packs, you can't resell the game. 

Hope this will help.

I wouldn't recommand buying the game in the current state for now. The microtransaction system is pretty bad, without any way of getting content without spending any money. I hope they will change that.
Gameplay is okay ... not thrilling, but still enjoyable. There are better TGC games in my opinion though.
If you want to pay 20$ to get an incomplete game that gives you the eact same experience that any online card game is giving you for free : go ahead.
Keep in mind that free online card games usually give you a way to earn new card, here you will have TO PAY FOR IT. YES PAY MORE THAN THE 20$ YOU ALREADY PAID.

I wanted to fall in love with Artifact, and for a while I was excited by exploring the potential, but I have to admit they haven't given us interesting options to play with.

There are about half as many cards and mechanics in the game as there needs to be, with removal options and rare AUTO-WIN end-game cards being the only things that have real value. The rest is just wasting time and donating gold.

Yes the RNG arrows are a big factor, but the cheapness of removal is what actually breaks the whole game. Ignite, Conflagration, At Any Cost, Annihilation, Eclipse, and other brainless removal options are so cheap that your enemy never has a chance to get value before they pop off. Why? Why let control dominate so early in each match? You can have 3 of each cards, and clearly control has the advantage because they can wait for the perfect time to use their spells, unlike army decks that need to create presence. But if I devote 10 cards and all that mana, card draw, and actions to develop them, and you only need 1 cheap spell to remove them all, guess who comes out on top? Guess where the meta goes? Units normally have a 25% chance to hit what you want, so they'll either be ignored completely (because they're irrelevant) or they'll be removed by the removal spells if they ever pose a threat. You can't overwhelm the removal deck, ever.

Here are some unit types that simply don't exist:
• Taunt units
• Pierce units
• Cleave units
• Always-attack-forwards units

To accomplish any of these effects you need to use spells and buy items. Why? What's the poitn of having these mechanics and yet have so many useless units? We desperately need more useful units that pressure the enemy.

Anyway, my theory is that Valve has a bunch of clever stuff they plan on doing, but they released the game too early and got way too greedy to let us have the good stuff up front. Now they're suffering, and I can't recommend anyone gives them a chance until they start respecting the genre they've decided to enter.
Overall the game is pritty good and original without any real gamebreaking bugs, where i find the problems is in the way they monetize the game you have already payd an extremely high price for, since you can get other just ass great games for free.
Also the place you will find the really bad bugs is in the shop/trading department of the game. And you may say that it is steam and not artifact that is the problem here but it is the same company that controls both so im just gonna blame them sue me, so for example when you buy cards it will sometimes say that the payment dident go throug and therefore you will obvously just try and buy the cards again, but the problem is that the first payment did go throug so now you are stuck with a boatlod of useles cards that you dident want because valve cant fix their shit.
good concept, bad execution.  most the time it feels like there is nothing you can do in the game... it feels unbalanced and way too much snow ball effect.

at the base of it, the game just isn’t as fun as I’d like it to be, it feels like what you do doesn’t matter and you are bound to RNG even when making a new deck or prebuilt. my guess is the learning curve is just too high for someone who hasn’t played much dota and haven’t played magic in over a decade... 

it is polished and I WANT this to be a good game or at least more approachable by people. 

also, why isn’t there a way to earn packs? without paying anything... if there is, it's not obvious.  

I wish there was non pvp stuff content in the game, like a story mode of something, I really like that from legends and hearthstone, with the dota lore that could be a REAL awesome avenue. 

end of the day, it is a well-produced game but it just isn’t much fun if you are just casually playing.

OH, BTW if you want a refund you better not open any packs because once you do, they won’t refund the game so there is that little gem to deal with :/ shit makes me mad. as long as you didn’t try and sell any of them, valve loses nothing by giving a refund and removing the cards, by not allowing sane refunds they lost respect.

I really wanted to like this game but it is just frustrating. sure, there are people who just get it and do great, I am sure of that, but for me, a casual card player, this is a little bunk. hopefully they will add value to the game that won’t be behind a pay wall so I can feel like the 20 bucks I spent wasn't in vain. I regret buying it...

Don't buy this game right now 

the leveling system is bad 

the rank system is a joke 

they changed the starter packs from 10 to 5...   why? basically Valve just scammed a lot of people including me 

I'm enjoying the game right now 

but this dosen't mean I'm going to continue playing more if Valve dosen't fix thier shit...


also the game is hard and you can't just open it and chill like HearthStone (well, that if you don't play vs a cancer druid or priest lol)
It's a premier game. So far I've spent about $20 + $50 and only now I have access to a small amount of cards needed to play ONE control deck. The fact that the game requires more money just to play competitive constructed is freaking absurd. I've already paid for the cards you greedy idiots. Stop making me pay to play the game too.

It's such a shame because the game itself is so much fun. The amount of decision making is tremendous and it goes completely to waste when you bring in these crappy monetization models.
The card game itself is not bad, but the monetization scheme is utterly bad. 
Good cards are very expensive, add to this that you have to pay to play competitive, I cannot recommend this game.
This is like is a MOBA won't allow you to play all the heros in the field but you had to buy them to unlock, or if you had to pay to play certain type of games. Oh wait... Oh Valve what have you become.
The biggest cashgrab in the history of digital card games.

ever felt bad about really expensive CCGs like Herathstone and Plants vs zombies: heroes (from elwectronic Arts BTW)

well this one takes the cake. i ve spent $100 on HS and on PVZH and got basically full collections and they are the most expensive CCGs, then there are other good CCGs like pokemon TCG Online, Duelyst, Faeria, Gwent Shadowverse etc.

All can by enjoyed full without spending any money or spending very little

Played most of the other titles for more than artifact (except for gwent, since i personally didnt like it) and all offered a lot more without wanting to take my money at every point.

This is the most dissappointing thing valve ever did. I like the gameplay but the monetization is so disgustingly bad and scummy, that it makes you want to play those pay2win mobile games instead, like Clash Royale or something....yes even those things that Valve bashed on so hard....are waaaay less scummy than this game...and at least they are more upfront with it.

mind you,  tickets are worthless unless you go 4:2 or better...you cant turn tickets into packs in any way...gonig 3:2 10 times (which happened to me and means 66% winrate) means you get NOTHING....you just get to try again.

ironically the game isnt as deep as it pretends to be and honestly....just stick to anything else. 

this pay to play, pay for decks and pay to compete is bullshit.. oh and theres also no ladder...just stupid ggauntlets where you go to 5 wins or 2 lossess...which sort of resembles arena....except Valve did an even more scummy thing: add MMR to it, so a good palyer will eventually drop in winrates and this makes sure there wont be so many 0:2s and 5:0 but instead a bunch of 2:2 and 3:2s so almost nobody wins any packs....

As a veteran card game Player, this is the Worst game Valve has ever made and the scummiest digital card game on the market.

avoid at all costs, if you want to play games with scummy bussiness models and got money to burn...go play a real TCG that is actually good, such as Yugioh...if not...play litterally ANY other digital card game on the market
Fun game, but the lack of progression and the only way to get cards is through the market has left a sour taste in my mouth. 
Wish I had researched earlier
I refuse to put more money into this game than the base price. And that one rule makes the game suck. Wether I was unlucky on my "free" 10 packs and ended up with trash I'm not sure but with no way to earn packs for free I'm now stuck with them. And the reason I emphasis "free" is because as soon as you accept these packs Valve refuse you the right to a refund. It's a trash game and can't recommend it unless you're a proper whale and love to sink at least £100 into getting a couple decent decks.
Holy cow.

I won't go into details about the pricing model or the RNG as the main thrust of my critique; those issues have been more or less beat to death at this point.

But WOW is this game boring. Like, unbelievably, mind-numbingly boring. Matches take a very long time for a CCG, and the action just isn't all that great. Perhaps it gets better at higher level play, but it just wasn't worth my time sticking around to find out. The starter decks feel so weak and lack synergy, so new players are welcomed to this overwrought game by stacks of cards that just feel so lame. 

GIven the alternatives on the market, in its current state, there is no way in hell I would recommend Artifact to a friend. Maybe to an enemy.
the game is a lot of fun, but basically just a well done scam since the last update.
they announced frequent card changes without any compensation as their new philosophy, what an interesting way to kill the first major digital trading card game....
1.No progression system at all, no way to earn cards/packs through playing, time wasted with nothing to show for.

2.RNG plays too impartant of a role. Creep spwan? RNG. Creep agro? RNG. Too many spells are RNG determined. Just go play the wheel of fortune, you'll get about the same gameplay.

3.Time investment. On average I spen 25-30 mins on a single match. Over engineering is what I think defines the gameplay. 

On the plus side, nice graphics, audio/music, detailed game world(if you bother to explore)

All in all, this game doesn't really worth your money or time. There're a million better card games out there.
There are so many cons and so few pros to this game. I will try to list them then summarize. TL:DR: Don't buy it.

Pros
-Rich Dota lore on (almost) every card
-Runs damn smooth even on my older computer
-Amazing sound design
-Stunning graphics
-Not too buggy
-Unlimited draft if you are into that (no rewards though)

Cons
-Terrible for beginners
-Pretty hard to learn what everything does even with the underlined text that has explanations, there are so many little interactions that are not taught anywhere and you have to get screwed over (or screw someone else over) to learn them all
-Costly, besides the base 20$ you have to buy all of your cards from the marketplace, or buy packs from Valve, or win atleast 4 out of 5 games in the arena without 2 losses, and if you lose your original 5 tickets without earning any back you can only recycle cards, or purchase more which leads to not being able to be "Free to Play (after the original price)"
-Extreme RNG, although you get a chance to take actions after nearly every element of RNG if the creeps decide not to attack the thing you want you are almost completley out of luck, that is if the creeps even go to the lane you want. You can choose which lane your hero goes into but not the positioning so i guess your screwed there too. Cards like cheat death and ogre magi are also heavy RNG. You like your enimies staying alive 100% of the time even though cheat death only has a 50% chance? Well too bad you better have improvement removal for it or you cannot do anything about it. 

Overall I loved spending hours upon hours reading the card lore and listining to different dota characters narrate it. I loved the amazing card art as well. The game just isn't fun to play in my opinion and the lore and sound is not enough for me to recommend it unless you are a die hard Dota lore fan (and even if you are just google the card lore and you can find people explaining it).
THIS IS A GOOD CARD GAME  but you have to buy whole card collection to get full experience with global matchmaking. If you dont want to buy every card avilable you can either lose a lot ( and long - every match takes some time with three lanes and respawning heroes) or play with your friends who also have low level cards. 

One redeeming fact is draft mode wich gives you some fighting chance but its more like constant demo version of a game if you play for free in casual mode because you just draw random cards and lose them after each game. 

So its more like physical trading card game - you need to buy every card on market or look for cards you want in booster packs and to have fun without getting distroyed by wealthier players you need to know other people with terrible decks so you can fight eachother and have some balance in battles.

I would not recomend this game to anyone i know but im gonna keep playing it on casual draft mode to get to know more about whole system because its still a good trading card game.
Like many others, I'm torn.

Pro:
- Awesome gamplay
- FREE phantom draft (you draft from all available cards and play with this decks vs others who did the same)
- FREE custom tournaments
- Beatiful artwork

Cons:
- Horrible monetization (as of now, a full set of cards is about >250$, which you'll have to shell out every 6-12 months when a new card expansion hits)
- No buffing / nerfing of cards because of said monetization
- No progression system / ladder
- No emotes / chat

If you are ONLY interested in playing draft, I would recommend the game. But as it stands now, I simply cannot recommend it overall. If Valve amends the monetization model (e.g. LCG, where you get all cards for a fixed price) I will change my overall verdict.
It does not have any diffrent from another card games. And you have to pay more if you wanna become better player. And people are seriusly stupids - they are waiting to much when they are playing... Anyway, if you have free time and if you are not doing anything in your fucking life - buy it and continue fuck your life.

Hepsi bu.
Played since the start of the closed beta. The idea is unique for a tcg but like most reviews have said at this pont, unless you're willing to spend $$$$ on opening card packs to get the best rare cards it's very unbalanced and feels like a free-to-play but pay-to-win game. It's not fun to play when your opponent has every good card in the game and destroys you by the 4th round because you refuse to shell out more than what the game's worth to have an advantage. 

This doesn't *feel* like any Valve game I've played before. It just feels like a cheap, shitty cash grab of a game that's based in a Valve universe and that makes me feel sad and kind of scared of games from them in the future.
Game mechanics are pretty great. RNG is kind of annoying and unnecessary for things like minions attacking or heroes attacking things you do not want. There isn't enough control for that in certain deck combos. I've lost several games with the enemy at less than 3 HP but I can't get a good RNG drop on a minion to attack to the face.

Biggest negative is monetization. I have magic cards from 20 years ago that still hold value or I have gone up significantly. I can't do that in this game, let alone it being a digital game and if the servers die then what? So many mistakes were made in this game. 

It was clear than releasing this game with alpha level features but with a full featured monetization system what their intentions were. Really unfortunate, may this be a lesson to all.

Still willing to come back, lord gabe still hasn't lost my trust. yet.


TLDR: Only buy this game if you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars to play more than one deck in constructed or if you're going to play draft mode only.

From the little I've been able to play the game itself seems great. The gameplay is solid and the soundtrack is on point. However, I can't recommend the game for most people because after buying it and recieving your initial 10 packs there doesn't seem to be any way to get more packs or cards to spend more money. There is a marketplace where you can sell and buy cards - but you still have to spend money. There's no in-game currency system or even a quest system to award you with packs for playing. If you buy this game without planning on spending any additional money on it then I sure hope you like draft mode.
I wanted to recommend Artifact. I really did. I would be wrong to do so.

Artifact is fun to play. It reminds me of Magic (no wonder, since Richard Garfield spearheaded this), it is exciting to bluff the opponents, it has a TRADING system, which no other digital card game has from what I've played so far. Matches are interesting and the mechanics are really cool. 

Problem is, there's no incentive to play. I find myself WANTING to play Artifact and then being immediately dissuaded by the fact apart from one or two matches, the game gets stale. There's no sense of progression. There's no feeling of actually accomplishing something. 

The game feels like an Early Access in terms of what it offers. No profiles? No stats? No deck comparison? Coming from the company that literally made stats an in-game purchase (looking at you Dota Plus), this feels like a feature yet to be implemented, and a feature that should be out already.

You can play draft and constructed formats, but only in a casual way. Ranked costs tickets and while I get this urge to buy tickets, I also stop myself because fuck this. Fuck all of this. I don't want to pay to be matched with equal match opponents. 

Artifact, in the end, is exactly what it was when it was first introduced in the International 2017: An audible dissapointment.
Core game is ok, INCREDIBLY unbalanced, though. Not worth $20, not worth buying cards and not worth sinking time into a game that's dying a week after release. 2018 valve is not the valve of the past and they should stop getting a free pass until they can prove to consumers that they haven't gotten just as bad as EA or ubisoft.
Its a very competetive game where skill actual matters. Bad reviews refer to the money you have to pay for cards.
Yes card packs are a little expensive but you can buy cards from the playermarket at a very low price.
So just look up what kind of deck you want to play a buy the cards via marketplace, its alot cheaper.

Edit: After a couple of games it gets boring.
Why? Because there is no ranking system at all, no replays, nothing.
You just play and gain nothing, not even visuals.
Ok first off, I asked for a refund after 3 phantom drafts, with ~11h of playtime. I didn't open or use any in game item, and I consider that for this kind of game 2 hours isn't nearly enough to figure out if you like it or not. My refund was denied because of excessive playtime, so don't buy Artifact unless you can try it with a friend, they won't let you try it for yourself.

Now to get the monetization system out of the way, I don't think it's good or bad on principle ; it could work because you can draft for free forever, in theory. Paying less than 20$ to have a free card game seems fair. The rewards of the paying drafts, however, are an absolute joke. Keeper's Draft is the worst offender, since even with a perfect run you still have to provide two other packs to keep playing. So let's say we ignore the paying drafts to focus on the draft and game experience, is paying to play Artifact worth it ?

Well no it's not. At all. I'll talk about the drafting system first because that's the format I'm the most interested in on other card games : first off, the card quality is downright awful. Don't expect to see any playables after the 2nd booster in a pack ; there are so many bad, bad fillers that drafting is never fun. This extension doesn't offer you to build a deck out of several options, it challenges you to add the fewest bad cards to your pool. The experience succeeds in providing the worst of all worlds : the random card selection of Hearthstone and the color restriction of Magic all wrapped up together. You can't send signals, you can open 2 powerful cards in a color then never see another for the rest of the draft. Heartstone deals with this issue by providing you playable cards only, and Magic has a closed pool of boosters running around so you can read into card selection to make sound decisions. None of this here. And last but not least, the hero restriction. God, who was the absolute moron that thought it would be a good idea to allow one hero pick and one pick only per pack ? I didn't draft that much, and I have already lost count of the number of times I picked a Hero mid-pack because it was in my colors after 2 dry packs only to be proposed a way better one next pack that I can't pick anymore. Remember when I talked about the lack of playables earlier ? Pick a hero early, then you have one less card to chose from if another hero is proposed to you. To make the matter worse, good Heroes add 3 good cards to your deck. Still remember the playables ? You can balance that by playing good heroes that will fill your deck with non-terrible cards. Couldn't pick or wasn't offered a good hero in your color ? Then feel free to add the always available ones to your deck, and complete your mediocre deck with garbage ! To sum up, the drafting system is frustrating and unrewarding.

Now to the game on itself. It feels good, it's beautiful, it's responsive, which is nice but what about the core mechanics ? Let's say there is a running game, played by gentlemen only, where the goal is to cross the finish line before your opponent, but with every step you take there's a device that punches you in the nuts. Now you can lie down, and every time you lie down you get a 5 seconds protection against the punches. One could argue that this is a strategic game, because you can try to either train in order to elevate your pain threshold and be able to run longer, or you can optimize the times you lay down to gain complete immunity to the punches and minimize the pain, allowing for a short but painful sprint in the end. You could also calculate that sweet spot inbetween where your learn to lay down when your nuts start hurting too much, but recover stamina fast enough to be able to endure another session of nut-punching. But, one could also argue that you could remove the punching component alltogether and focus on running, which would be maybe, I don't know, funnier ?
That's how I feel about Artifact. The RNG aspect of the creep spawn and the way worse aspect of the random hero positionning when you assign them to a lane, combined with the random targeting are the kick in the nuts you take at every new round. Your way of lying down is the great deal of cards designed to correct that randomness (move this hero to that place, make this minion attack this target) and when all is said and done, you end up with a bunch of feast or famine situations. Don't have anybody in front of your red hero ? Well too bad, looks like you just lost. Oh, your 12 attack hero decided to target that creep left of her instead of going for the 2 health tower ? What a shame, you just lost ! Of course it evens out and sometimes your opponent is the one suffering from it, but that absolutely doesn't make the system better. But what if instead of enduring the randomness and hoping to draw that one card that answers this specific situation, you scraped all those silver bullet cards and replace them with decent, generic ones ? Let each player chose where to deploy her or his hero, then do the same for creeps and now you have a real game, not a random number generator entangled within another random number generator.

TL;DR : Artifact is a (artificially) complex game ; it is simply not any FUN.
Man, I was looking forward to this game. Big fan of Dota and I have played MTG for years.  I would have to say my biggest frustration is how difficult it appears to be to increase your card collection.  You can enter events and draft to build a deck, but you don't get to keep any of the cards unless you do a draft format that not only requires two event tickets, but also requires that you purchase the five packs that you are drafting from.  I expected the process of buying packs, but not the fact that I would just have to keep throwing money at a game I already paid $20 for.
The game itself is very good and the presentaion and polish are fantastic.

BUT

If you buy the initial game NEVER buy a single pack or card EVER!  You would have to be an idiot to build a collection in this game you will go broke.  It is p2w in the worst way possible.  

I think it's a hard pass which is a shame because they had a really good game here but as usual greed messes it up and now it will be made fun of and meme'd into oblivion.
Been playing just a little bit now, but the game is pretty bad in teh sense that as a new player, im just stuck with what i was given at the start unless I pay for it. The mecanhics are pretty fun, and the game is pretty interesting, but not interesting enough for me to feel like id want to invest in the game at this point. Ive seen a very limited portion of the game, I am locked and unable to really experience more without paying. I have such little insentive to actually invest in the game due to the fact the very little bit ive been allowed to see, isnt that interesting.

Also turns take too long, when im averaging 30 min a game for a TCG, and most of that is just waiting for animations, which is made worse because in not playing on the best connection. Its just instantly very frustrating, so im just gonna stick with hearthstone, which even for its flaws, was has actually some common sense as regards animations and timers.
unfinished and dead. strongly recommend: do not put money into the game!
It needs time and the market is already a crashing shit show. Just wait and come back in 6 month or so.
Long story short, this game is too random for me.  The worst part is Steam will not give me a refund after only playing the tutorial and 2 games.  I guess with the "meh" reviews this is getting they are trying to get every nickle they can out of it.  So that's $20 down the toilet for me.  I was on board with paying for a decent game but now I'll have to rethink that since with games like Hearthstone I can download it and play it and leave it with nothing but time lost.  I think this new model they are trying will prove to be a failure.  I'm certainly not pulling for them.
Don't buy into this scam. I was unaware of the horrendous card-buying scheme on top of the already ridiculous price tag. Upon attempting to get a refund, it was denied because I already opened the cards that came with the game (with no warning attached). GG Valve.
Couldn't even get though the first two bot matches, it's so boring with unthinkable long animations between any actions. You think Jabberwock in Hearthstone takes a long time? Wait for the lane switch in Artifact.
Really regret purchasing this game.

Overall it's a great card game (MECHANICALLY), but the variety in decks is non existant. The balance is just plain silly, there are a few very very obvious cards that, value wise, DRAMATICALLY increase you chances of winning lanes on there own turn one. 

Shell of a game, don't make the same mistake I made.
It's fun gameplay-wise, but Valve's greed leaves a bad taste. If you don't want to spend real money, you're at the mercy of RNG of the cards you got from your initial 10 packs. As a result, you feel no sense of progression because you're stuck with whatever you got. Not worth it.
You sold this game for money

But I did not receive card packs and event tickets 

I've reconnected it several times and reinstalled it

I waited from (PST) 13:00 to 15:00, but it was the same.

I really regret why I bought this game

Maybe it's time to leave

I can't get a refund because I bought it on November 11

Because I trusted valve
DotA2, Portal player, Valve Complete Pack owner. Not recommended.

Pros:
[list]
[*] Nice interface. Familiar for DotA2 player.
[*] Good gameplay, especially for hardcore player.
[*] TODO
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*] Would be better if we have casual mode, I mean really-casual mode.
[*] 55% off by the second week if Complete Pack owned. May I refund?
[/list]
Another card game, and as i may suspect you want to know is it better than Hearthstone?
No its worse. And that being said i also want to add that i dont like hearthstone(played it for couple of years, got enough of waisting 200$  each years on cards that dont exist just so you could make only 1 or 2 good decks, now sitting on mtg).
1)Money grab-i made some quick calculations and i must say what to make full collection you will have to spend something around 300-400 dollars to get whole collection(if you will have some lock and if you gona resell all doubles ofc). Hearthstone players may say what this is releatively cheap, but Ranked-game equivelent require ticket to start game(ranked games are  better for any dicent card game player cz in normal its just stupidity fiesta) and if for example HS charges 2$ per run, AF wants whole 5$. Also if you will lose too soon you not gona get pack or anything-just kiss goodbye 5$ bucks goodbuy nerd. And no one said what Valve not gona go Blizzard way and not gona start ban old cards, take from ranked some op cards or nerf that op card you bought for 10$ to useless crap worth 2 cents at best.
2)Luck>brains - no matter how good you play,you still can be owned by complete idiot just cause he is more lucky. You are not only dicerolling on topdeck cards, and dice effects of carrds, but you also have no povers on unit positioning on each lane and their way of attack. 
You can easily get fcked on the first one or two turns just because game made every single enemy lane to focus your champs.
Your perfect game winning combo can be denied cz of 5 possible points to spawn it spawned on that point where his game-winning spell will be nothing.
You can loose just despereatly trying to buy at least some teleport or mobility items while enemy gona just keep geting one after another from shop.
3)Balance- right now its green-red controll meta(with blue and black for cheesy situation), but game still not perfect. Some cards defenetly gona get nerfed. In random draft its even worse-usualy you gona just get to see enemy champs on starting screen and perfectly understand what "yup, im fcked". Too many cards which instantly remove heroes and at the same time dening any comeback. No one will convince me what Phantom Assasin which have 6 mana insta  killing hero card is balanced
So yeah 10 packs is not enought to build even 1 good deck, and with 5 tickets i manage to get 3 more tickets and with that i manage to get 1(one) pack. After that i checked run price(5$) and realised what fck this sht im out. I realy liked random draft but in free there are too many guys who dont care about game and thus making mistakes and thus its not fun(realy you just roflstomp guy who have 0 intentions or 0 abilities to win-what is the fun in that?).
I would have played more of it if price for tickets would not be so ridiculous(5$ Karl! 2 and half packs! Which retard in Valve said what it will be good idea to sell ranked tickets for more money that actual packs?) or if i got at least one pack out of bad ranked run.
One thing to loose on cz enemy plays better than you and other thing to loose is when you see enemy managed to draft luna and phantom assassin and you realise what at turn 6 you gona instaloose just because they have op 6turn removals and there is no way to counter it,and you wont even get anything for your suffering.
You could say many thing about HS but it have many thing to keep you in game(dungens, brawls, packs even for bad arena runs) and huge paywall if you want to go in ranked with more than 1 or 2 aggro decks. ARtifact demands to get paid for every single action and at the same time dont do anything to keep you ingame,just asking for more money.
The concepts behind this game was very sophisticated and at first glance you may think that it entails deeper strategy. 
However at the end of the day splitting the game board into 3 lanes whilst only allowing cards to be played if the hero matches in the same lane only frustrates and confuses the player. 

Not to mention the absurb control and momentum swinging cards that you must play around. Play around these cards or lose, or don't and still lose. 
Because of the colour and hero mechanic, a team can have one hero of a certain colour and with one colour specific card, be able to destroy 6 turns of strategy you have developed. 

If youre a casual card game player you best look elsewhere.
Feels like a flavour of the month kind of game gets old fast with only a few viable strategies right now. It could be worth picking up down the road with more content to shake things up. Seems like valve just trying to cash in.
It's unbelievable that this is the same game from the creator of the M:TG and more recently Keyforge which is also a fantastic card game. 

Game left me with a rollercoaster of emotion which eventually boiled over to one simple thing. I'm not in a mood for a card game where one match can last up to an hour. Every win and loss feels like it wasn't contributed by skill, rather a roll of the die. If I wanted dice to make or break my game, I would rather play Yahtzee. 

To end on a positive note, it has room to grow into the game that will be enjoyed by more than the current playerbase. It seems that developers addressed certain major issues with the first patch. I hope that it will be better in the future.
I think micro-transactions is not the right phrase, macro-transacions seems more fitting considering a majority of the games content is behind a paywall making the inital price of the game feel more like a deposit for a finanically crippling loan more so than the cost to play a video game designed for fun.

The design, the game, it's all great but the paywall and lack of progression is really making me feel like i'm gaining nothing by playing..

A ranking system like hearthstone has, is great for feeling like you're achieving something when you're not.. Have a monthly season where you get rewards for your rank.
Have some quests in the game perhaps? 3 daily wins you get a reward, similar to how hearthstone has it. Now I know these are things taken from hearthstone, but they're what make people come play daily. It's fun learning the game, but there's no reason to continue playing other than boredom. Which I understand that's what the games purpose is, but having something to achieve whilst playing will always prosper for games.

As there's a huge pay wall behind most of the game, I just can't give it a positive review at this time, although if you are on the fence and you enjoy card games and you don't mind spending a little bit of money additionally to get a deck then definitely give it a try. The game is good fundamentally, it's just they got some pretty important stuff wrong or missing.
just a greedy disgusting game!   

You will get 10 card packs    and  0  after that!!   unless you pay.  Either PAY MORE  OR NO MORE CARDS FOR YOU ! .     Cannot ever chose your own cards in  draft mode = NOT DRAFT  UNLESS YOU PAY MORE !!    

This is a robbery!
Can not get a refund because I opened a pack in game, that came with the game. 

No where was it mentioned in game that you are voiding a purchase. 



I dislike this type of game and have been refused a refund for less than 90mins of gameplay. 

Thanks
game is dying, dont get it unless it goes f2p or on sale.

The game is designed for you to spend and lose more money
https://steamcommunity.com/id/smthpickboy/recommended/583950/

i have been experiencing crashes at different occasions and at different random times.
I was waiting for Artifact so long, but today I got really disappointed. Impossibility to obtain cards, without paying real money, makes me mad. In every other TCG, you are able to get cards buy hard work, but not here. I highly recommend you, not to buy this "game"
I would refund the game but I can't after claiming the gift. Instead I'll write a review. Gameplay is good and I don't have any major complaints to say about it. But to get more cards you have to pay. Real money. There is no way to get them for free. And there aren't any player progression features in this game. If you pay you will progress, if not you won't.
The game itself is fine, and could be interesting given enough players experimenting with different strategies, but with no apparent way to obtain more cards to give variety in decks other than shelling out money for random packs, I don't see it attracting those players, making it unlikely that it'll be good for the few people who actually end up buying and playing it.
Currently too barebones in systems and progression to be anything more than a platform for play. Little to no reward for time spent. Only worth it to me because I have friends who want to draft and play together in phantom and casual modes. Solo experience is very sub par.

EDIT 1 : After Patch 1.2, barely anything has changed. New players get screwed and get less than established players, putting them at a bigger disadvanatage than they already are without spending money. Progression system is badly implemented and too slow. Seasons probably lasting a few months means that 15 packs is all you get. Valve still refuses to scrap their market based reasonings. Avoid this game at all costs. A waste of time and money.

please give the game a free gift when winning a game.

or given a story game with a gift card for example.


Because it's too boring when playing casual doesn't get anything, while you need to use a ticket to get the card pack.

given game history profile, ranked play with prizes, for example, etc ...

Too boring when playing casual and not getting a reward at all.

Make this game as attractive as possible, like DOTA. Which the player will never leave
DO NOT buy this game, unless you plan to spend hundreds of dollars into it.

What happens when you buy the game is that you're given 5 tickets, which are necessary to play draft mode, which is the game's only interesting aspect. The thing is, you're gonna run out of tickets in like 10 to 15 hours since the reward system is way harsher than other card games. What is the problem with that you might be wondering?

Well the problem is that you simply CAN'T buy tickets with in-game currency! You will have to pay with real money to get tickets, there is no other way. In fact there is no in game currency, no daily quests like in Hearthstone. You will have to pay everything with real money if you want to continue to play.

Now why did I say that the reward system is very punishing? Let's compare with Hearthstone, a game I know well and its main competitor. In HS arena, if you get a 50% winrate or less (3-3 or less), you get part of your 150 gold back. In artifact, with a 50% winrate, you get litteraly nothing. 

Maybe you're going to say that you are very skilled at the game and you will have way above 50% winrate, well you won't be rewarded either: In HS for the max number of wins (12) you get at least 300 gold, which means you can get 2 more arena runs. On top of that you get 2 packs. Well in artifact for the max number of wins you get  back your entry fee of 1 ticke and 2 packs, that's all. On top of that, out of the 24 cards you get out of those packs, you're gonna have to sell 20 because that is the price of a ticket, and you have no other way of getting tickets. Which leaves you with 2 tickets and 1/3 of a pack. For a max wins run. 

Furthermore, in HS if you run out of gold you just wait a few days, do your daily quests, and you're back in the game. In artifact, you run out of tickets, you pay. There's no other way. So no matter if you are a good player or not , you're gonna get screwed anyway because the game just doesn't want you to win. The game wants you to lose so you can pay.

In conclusion, I have rarely seen a game with such a vicious financial system. The reward system is unfair, you have no in game currency, and on top of that you have to pay to get the game! So if you're bored with you current card game: HS, shadowverse, Gwent, I guarantee you that it is way better that this game. Stay away, don't buy it, even if you can afford it. Because all you gonna do is encourage game companies to go further and further into this rapacious system.

Edit: : I acknowledge the recent update which introduces some free tickets, however my review stays negative since they only did that as a response to the criticism and not at the launch of the game.
The game is another rather medicore addition to the already oversatured digital card game space.

Personally, Runescape: Chronicle, Gwent and Eternal were all far more interesting and engaging despite not having a big name like valve attached to them.

One of the main issues with the game, is that the board state in the first turn is determined randomly, although in the long run it balances it out it's not fun or exciting to have no control over your hero dying in the first turn to RNG.

Not to mention the monetization is actually ridiculous.

As a new player who didn't participate in beta, it took me 12hours to use up 1 event ticket. For a game that claim's there's "no grind", I sure as hell felt like I was grinding to use up my "free" ticket. 

In the end, even after winning 60% of my games I ended up with $1.00 profit in 12hours, which compared to free TCGs is rather abysmal.

Final verdict 4/10, If you are going to play this game, I advise you sell everything you can on the market to recover as much of the cost of this overpriced game as you can.
pls realize that when there's no one play constructed mode due to the expense, this game is doomed to die soon.
it's on the track that almost everyone only play draft mode
Decent game but way too slow for my taste. Wish I could ask for a refund but once you accept the first packs after the tutorial you are waving your possibility for refund.
this game is the biggest money scab i have seen to date on any card game i have played paying $30 for a game and then having to fork out more money for new cards that you cannot earn in game is horrible also trying to refund dose not work if you have opend any of the free packs they give you at the start big thumbs down from me i really hope they change it in the future
Artifact is an amazing concept, taking card games to a new level. Though, it is executed insanely poorly.

There is too much out of your control for it to be truly strategy. In Dota everything that happens is down to the players. In Artifact, the game often makes it more difficult for you by playing a small percentage of the game itself.

But surely being able to build your own decks, pick your own heroes, spells, defences would mean you have full control right? I personally do not feel in control of this game while I play it.

Having no way to communicate with your opponent or even "gg" makes me feel disconnected from being in a game. Most of the time it feels just like playing bots.

For Example:

[olist]
    [*] The game decides which empty slot on the board all your creeps and heroes are placed in.
    [*] Heroes and creeps don't always attack forward and sometimes are randomly given targets either side of empty space.
    [*] All heroes and creeps are randomly placed at the start of the game.
[/olist]

Now I'm terrible at Artifact, a great player would probably have no trouble playing around these systems. But having more things to play around other than your cards and your opponent really doesn't appeal to me in a card game.

If you're new to card games, I probably wouldnt start with this. Sure, the RNG makes more chances for all players, however most of the time it seems to be making the game more unfair.



The playerbase seems to be getting smaller as time goes on. But the game hasn't been out for that long and there have been no major patches. Artifact is very much a game that could adapt to feedback and improve. So the game isn't down and out yet.

Though as of current I cannot recommend this game until further patches improve on the various issues other players are mentioning.

I played almost all TCG/CCG games online but such ridiculous milking of the money are out of the line. Literally, you need to pay $10.50 to enter the draft(2 tickets and 5 boosters) and if you win 5 games, suprisingly maximum what you can recieve are $7(2 tickets 3 boosters). Seriously??? . The greed is out of control here. Even being super expert on this game you still be paying hell of the money, which is absurd.
This game is so heavily based on RNG that it takes away from any fun that could be had. Games are won lost simply on the basis of luck. I haven't enjoyed a single game I've played so far, even the games I've won. And Valve has no plans to update or balance anything?? Even in spite of community outcry for literally any sort of improvement to the game's balancing? If I could get a refund, I would. Because I certainly wasted my money buying this game.
The game looks like fun. Unfortunately, the tutorials are lacking in detailed informatiion about how the game works. The tool tips for key words on each of the cards is great but it's a lot of reading. It would be nice if they had a tutorial for each of the key words. It took me 5 minutes just to figure out how to make a deck. I'm still not sure how many of each card you're allowed to have in each deck or what the minimum card limits are for the different types of cards.
While the gameplay is refreshing and fun, there's not much real reason to play it outside a couple hours, free draft would be fun but the game is balanced for constructed so draft can get really broken, constructed is dead and the only ones who'd enjoy it are those who'd use the strongest card, the... credit card.        

In all honesty artifact was a mistake, it took multiple no no's in this genre and did it then added a marketplace so that they'd shoot themselves in the foot making it super difficult for them to fix the issues this game has.      

I'm honestly really suprised tho, not only because valve usually have the intelligence to know that this was like a 0/10 but  because it has issues in so many places.    

There is just zero incentive to play, zero ways to get cards outside the starting packs they give you, you are forced to play the only game with a population and that's free draft and that gets old fast, constructed is the foundation of cards games, draft popularity is more recent but not as big, and it's popularity is based online from it being best way to earn packs/coin in others online card games.        

It's like SFV in a way, where capcom completely lost the plot and made the worst SF game in history, Valve have gone and done the monetisation version of that mess up for Artifact.
Be honest this game is pretty bad. .... but still probably the best online trading card game out there. Flashback little bit, I played MTG for years, didn't win any big titles but I think I'm pretty good. For trading card game I believe the actual real card that you holding makes everything different. Not saying online card game is bad it just feels different IDK why. .... I have to say this probably the best online trading card game I had played over the years, but still not at the point to make me satisfied ye.
I can run dota on low settings with decent fps, hearthstone too so i thought artifact would run fine but nope 
If you have an 8 years old potato like me  don't even think about it
Artifact is an excellent card game plagued by terrible decisions made for aspects outside the match.

As I'm sure you've read in other reviews, this game is pay-to-win. Not in the sense of other pay-to-win games that you can stomp every game by a single overpowered purchase, but in the sense that you cannot create a decent deck without paying far more than the game's original price. 

Let me provide an overview of the game's monetization. 
Purchasing the base game provides you with 10 card packs of 12 cards each. With luck and some clever arrangement, this is enough to craft a single C tier deck. From there you can purchase additional packs for two dollars each. Alternatively, you can sell the high value cards you recieved from the start, but don't rely on this tactic, since only about a dozen different cards have a value over a dollar. Aside from direct purchase, only a single type of gamemode allows you to gain additional cards, and it requires a one dollar event ticket to enter. In order to win back your ticket or a single card pack, you must win 3, 4, or 5 games without losing two, which is nearly impossible considering you'll be faced solely against the strongest decks others have purchased.

Essentially, your decks's strength will always be less than that of someone who's paid slightly more for theirs. 
It's simple - if you cannot pay in this game, you cannot play in this game.

Not only is this unfair, it's also not as fun. Other card games allow you to earn additional cards, so you can experience that great feeling when you open an excellent card or find the exact one you've been looking for. You can't experience this in Artifact, since any card you gain was most likely bought directly from another player.

It's clear that Valve is targetting this game to a very specific audience - card game veterans with cash to spare. 
Despite having previous card game experience and dozens of bot matches before testing my deck against the world, I faced eleven losses against high-value paid decks before my first victory. So much for matchmaking pairing you with players near your "skill level". 

Artifact isn't all bad, though. The mechanics of the game itself feel fair, the interface is straightforward, and Dota fans would probably agree that Artifact still plays similar to what they're familiar with. Those opposed to the payment model can instead play using rotational featured decks, or draft a deck out of the universal card collection to use for a series of games. 

However, a few decent choices doesn't justify that half of the game is locked to the top 1%. The game is just brutal to new players. Statistics show that a large portion of casual players have already left, which will make it even more difficult for new casual players to enter, since they'll only be matched against the long-time players.

If you want to purchase this game and play against only bots, then go for it. 
But until Valve ultimately gives up on this game model and makes major adjustments in a future update, it's not a game I recommend.
Having played many card games over the years, including MtG, Ascension, Dominion, Warhammer Invasion, HS, TES:L, Shadowrun, Trains, Sentinels of the Multiverse, San Juan, Splendor, Castles of Burgundy, L5R, and Keyforged, to name a few, there are so many missed opportunities for compelling mechanics and strategic choices in Artifact that it's depressing and frustrating to play. Just about every aspect and phase needs re-imagining. The game "works" and there are "good" players, but it's not an intuitive game that leaves you feeling like you setup great plays or clever manuevers. Effects and cards just seem to happen, followed by a defeat/victory screen that leaves you wondering what you did right/wrong. The only thing worthy of high praise is the superb art direction, which is absolutely amazing.
Great game play but when you put a price tag on your card game you should have a way to earn free cards through grind. Hearthstone is free and those who developed it even know that.
Game sucks.  I barely made it through the guide games before I wanted to turn it off.

If you're in to a steam based version of Magic the Gathering -- great.  Otherwise, not recommended.
I am SORELY dissappointed.  The Store Page video for the game leads one to believe the game will be something it's not.  The "Tutorial" is a ruse, and truly gives you no insight to what to expect, and by the time you are unfortunate enough to want to go past the "Tutorial" you are forced ownership.  I opened the packs...EXTREME REGRET!  And played once. And I'm out the $$ spent for a game I WILL NEVER TOUCH OR RECOMMEND!  Don't waste the money.  And developers  ... SHOW GAMES FOR WHAT THEY ARE, not what you see them as!  People work hard for their money, and you got paid for this dribble of uselessness. I will add, for any hard@#%$@es, that the 3 hours was spent learning the game, and finding no aspect worth continuing.  That should say alot too.  It should not take 3 hours to learn a card game.  Think developers! Think!
Video games give you the opportunity to create an even playing field where both people have access to consistent strategies and can know what to expect from each other. Physical CCGs work because you play them against people you know or meet irl and can physically trade cards and there's a whole value transaction risk rewaqrd aesthetic. But electronic CCGs take the worst aspects of both and combine them. This is why I was flabberghasted to find out VALVE of all companies was going in on the "digital CCG" genre. And they have so far not impressed me.

I still want to like this game. I'm still thinking about it even after I've written it off as frustrating and boring. I would like to enjoy playing the new valve game but, hear me out. When I'm losing, i feel trapped and claustrophobic. When I know i'm abnout to lose and there's nothing I can do, that sucks. On the other hand, when i'm about to win, I feel no sense of accomplishment, just lucky. Except one really good match I had against a bot using the first crappy deck I built. And it was a close game. Out of the nine or ten matches I've played so far, I won three. Maybe I just don't understand how to build a deck but I also see valve enacting the problem with this type of game. 

Computers are able to do things so fast that you don't even know what they're doing. For all I know, the cards in my packs could be decided at the moment I open them. Deliberately factoring in cards I already own, how much I've spent previously, how long it's been since i bought cards, and wahtever data they have on me. They can use that to manipulate people into buying more cards. The way electronic casino games are well known for doing. Regular CCGs don't have this problem because the cards are put into a blind package and can't be changed before the customer opens them, much less BASED ON who's opening them. 

I'm continuing to give this game a chance but as it stands i don't recommend anyone start spending money on it, because you may not want to ever stop, and I consider that inherently unethical game design. And i'm thoroughly disappointed that Valve would employ such a system. After seeing this I"m more worried than excited about the future of my favorite game company.
Spent money on the game, then when the game was at a peak, I purchased cards that are now worth jack shit, was very fun at the beginning, but the amount of $$ you have to spend to even be relevant makes it hard to keep up. Not to mention the lack of an actual decent matchmaking system. I play casually and am constantly playing against people 15+ levels ahead of me. Fun game, but the UI, matchmaking, card gaining system in general, make it kinda unplayable. A lot of work needs to be done before this shit is finished.
TLDR: Recent patches made the game unbearably rushed, jarring and more difficult to follow. No longer feels like a deep strategy game.

Before the recent patches I enjoyed game a lot, but recently the time to make moves was reduced from 2 minutes per round to 30 seconds! Yes that's 75% faster. Basically this turned the game from a nice relaxed deep strategy experience to something like playing blitz chess where you half guess what's the next best move is before the time runs out. No time for strategy, or reading your opponent like it was before. They basically made the timer the main focus of the game. 

Now in last patch they also made all the animations faster, making the game difficult to follow, and really ruining the feel of the game. Some of the animations are truely jarring and a pain to watch right now. I can imagine for new players these changes are even worse. 

It's like someone at Valve decided the solution for players leaving is to try to change this game from a deep strategy game to a fast action game. I fail to see why anyone wanting a fast action experience will play this game in the first place, and for those liking the deep strategy, the experience was just ruinied. I played for almost 300 hours before these changes and now I just don't want to touch it.

On top of all that, game is still too expensive and lacks proper progression and ranking systems.
I can't honestly decide if I like this game or not. It feels like the game was months from release, but they decided to push it out for a quick cash grab. The gameplay is fun, but also unsatisfying. The issues don't come with the gameplay itself. The focus should be on the cards.

These are things this game needs to stay alive.

- Daily and weekly quests for earning cards, tickets, and other purchasable items.
- More diverse cards. (Some cards feel as though they are just slight variations of eachother.)
- Jungle Legion Commander.

Replayability is a massive issue for this game. With how much luck is involved not only in drawing cards, but not being able to choose what place your heros go in? Taking away freedom of the player does not add complexity Valve. It seems like they still believe that the best way to make a game involves selling chip readers that sit on your desk so when you need to win a match you just pop in the good old MasterCard.

In short...

- The game is shallow.
- Far too randomized. (Even for a CCG/TCG.)
- Restricted to Pay2Play.
- Requires money to stay competitive.
- Lacks high level strategic value.

I have no issue with a buy in mechanic, this will stop smurfs and card hunters from flooding the market with cards. However, the game is exremely unfriendly to the average/casual player and doesn't provide opportunity for steady progression.

Valve. Fix your game.
The monetisation mechanics in current card games are an EVOLUTION to the classic MTG economy. I have no idea why this small indie company decided to go backwards. AND WHERE ARE MY PACKS?!
I want to like this game so much, but there is way too much RNG.  The flop of cards, they way you can run 40 cards and see no hero ability cards while your oponent can get 8 of them, random multicast random mana returned random creeps, random attack paths that ruin your board, random card lock, random hero placement, random free shop cards, buy a random item, random discard on coup de grace... unbalanced heros that cause random draft to be decided on what heros you see... way way way too much chance.
It´s an alright time waster, but there is no sense of progression at all unless you pay, technicly you could use the 5 free draft tickets the game gives you and if you just keep winning and not losing much, you get your tickets back, maybe +1 as well as card packs, but if you are on a losing streak you got no choice but to spend even more money.
It lacks any real motivation for you to come back and play it again, the player numbers speak for themselves. I hope the game improves over time, but as of right now don't buy it.
I simply cannot afford to play this game seriously do to my financial situation. I'ts well made, but monetized (Like every other AAA title in late 2018)to the point i literraly have to cut from my food in order acquire the assets to compete on this game. 

We need game ethics ASAP.
The game took 20 minutes to load
Then another 30 minutes for the tutorial
Then another 2-3 hours for my "starter kit" to arrive
To then be plagued with disconnects and server issues. Because the game delayed in giving me the items that came with it I have gone over the 2 hour window for refunds and steam will not issue one. It's a disgusting business practise and that isn't mentioning the fact that it has a unfriendly business model looking to gouge the customers wallets for as much as they can.

I highly reccomend that you stay away from this title and find another card game to play.

Edit: I have managed to recoup most of my money by selling the cards I received in-game. I still would not reccomend it unless they add some form of progression system or methods to earn packs in-game.
Awful mess of a pay 2 win game. Paid game, and then you need to pay even more to play anything that lets you progress...

Game crashed about 10+ times during the tutorial so it took more than 3 hour to complete due to having to restart the bot game every time.
Interresting art style, you know its valve and it will be nice to encourage them to produce a great game and a good experience and i will be very happy to give a nice review of my experience but truly your most powerful card here is your Credit Card.

A match can be pretty long so you really need to be into it in order to fully enjoy the experience and you need to enjoy to buy digital card to keep it short, you need to be able to appreciate many issue in order to have a good time with this game. 

I do not recommend this game.

 Elder scrolls legends is much more fun if you are into card game, good art style and music.
Most garbage card game i have ever played, the balance of the cards is hilarious. Idk why the fck did i preordered card game from valve, like what did i expect from those pay to win company? Im not usprised that thi sgame is so trash like its unplayable, no ranking system, no competitive play. Damn waste of money, feels bad i cant refound this game anymore.
So let me just say, I like the game itself. The format is interesting and engaging...what holds it back is a paywall which can be mitigated by using the steam marketplace. Why subject yourself to the RNG gods with a booster pack when you can get what you are looking for. But the most OP cards will obviously cost you and ultimately pay to play is a factor in this game.

My biggest gripe about this game is matchmaking, sometimes you are outclassed or you are stomping the opposition. You can be mutiple levels above them or they can be double your level. Furthermore, the part that really burns me in regards to matchmaking is the fact the game gives TOO MUCH TIME to make a turn. It shouldn't take more than 15 seconds to make a move, and time per turn should increase as more mana is available. 

It is a borderline strategy to wait to the last damn minute to make a move even if they don't even have a mana to make a move they will wait 30-40seconds before ending their turn.

In the end, matchmaking needs to be improved and more cards need to be earnable especially outside of matchmaking. Fortunately I got this for free from Steam for being a original Steam Link buyer, I can only imagine how frustrating this game must be for those who paid for it. 

I am now going to uninstall this game, its not worth it being free because the whole thing requires people to play. If they fixed matchmaking taking better consideration of levels which I like to think has been better more recently than my earlier experiences. But they need to take into consideration people who milk the timer for everything it is worth, let those people fight against each other or give me a MODE WHERE THE TIMER IS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED so I can play against people who only have that mode engaged. 

Farewell Artifact, you are a beautifully crafted game only when bots are involved. Other players make or break the game for you....and you allow it.
This game is not Pay 2 Play, it's Pay 2 Win.

You are gonna face challengers whose decks are $60 or $70 above the value of your own deck.

Some cards are really imbalanced and will swing the game arround. And guess what? They are pretty expensive.
This game is Pay to win whoever pays the most money is going to win every game. Game seems really unbalanced with certain heros being way better then others. Hope you got a credit card because if you dont prepare to lose every game unable to farm more cards without paying for them.
Artifact fails on many levels.

1. Combat RNG:
Spawn RNG
1 Person is always angry RNG (Lich, BH, Tidehunter, Ogre etc.)
Arrow RNG

2. Excessively long games, partly due to how the game plays, but predominantly due to some animations (duel, gremlins, chainfrost mystic flare etc.) taking over 10-15 seconds which also feeds into player turn time.
3. 15% tax on all transactions. Why?
4. Set number of event tickets and packs per season.
5. Cards will be nerfed with no recompensation in future.
6. THEY ACTUALLY HALVED THE AMOUNT OF CARDS YOU GET FOR BUYING THE GAME LMFAO
7. Balance changes didn't touch the U/G which runs constructed.


im home and able to play this game a few times a week. I think its a great game. i feel like you have much more control over the outcome than many other similar games. but the poor management of the economy and the premature state of the game apon release means like many other i will be leaving this in the dust. £15 to play something many other poorer devlopments would offer for free. not cool. a rarity system which makes buying card pack almost feel point less. not cool. but wait you can buy cards on the market. just stright up buy the deck you want to play for £20-30. cool! until a bug in market has stoped from give vaule my money. seven days until i spent a bit on a incomplete game which ive dropped £60 (enough for a AAA game), do i have 10% of the cards? not even close. really not cool. i wish i could have all my money and forget about this bitter sweet game. 
god damn please realase complete games. you've lost my interest and trust.

Regarding the monetization structure, if you are already used to paying for games like Hearthstone and MTG, you'll probably feel like Artifact is extremely reasonable. If you're new to trading card games, you're going to feel robbed. It's really that simple.

As far as the actual game, this is one of the most intelligently designed card games I have ever played, but it seems like when Garfield was designing it he became obsessed with RNG. Not being able to select what lane your starting heroes go into creates scenarios where you can start the game behind just because you happened to get your weakest hero across from their Axe or PA. 

The decision to have your lanes go in random directions also boggles my mind. I shouldn't have my entire setup from the previous round because a random roll of the dice decided my hero should attack to the left instead of attacking the tower. It just feels like they got carried away with the "layers of strategy" and ended up putting systems in that make your strategy meaningless. 

In a genre that already has the inherent RNG of drawing from a deck of cards, it is maddening that the designers felt the need to add several more layers of randomness to what they are pitching as having deeper strategy than any other card game.

TL;DR - If you are looking at Artifact to play for fun, do it. If you're looking for a new card game to play competitively, look elsewhere.
I was forced to wait a few hours on release to be able to play due to my packs not showing up.(some card pack bug thousands of people had) We should have got a free pack or something as compensation for our time.  

I try to sell a card but it goes into hold for 15 days. This makes it impossible to sell cards for a satisfactory price. I think eventually that time goes down to 7 days which still is to long. Instant I think if you have android phone with an app. NOT EVERYONE HAS ANDROID PHONE!

Most cards are worth like 2 cents,  Makes no sense to buy packs at first, just go on market and buy them cheap then once you get pack rewards in the future sell them to make profit.

My issue  Is I  add steam wallet funds and Artifact game gives message "funds were added to wallet recently/ verification to your card is required".  Jump through more hoops!          SERIOUSLY I CANT BUY OR SELL IN YOUR GAME without signing over all my organs to them. Never Had a problem using steam wallet until this game. 

Days later still want to play this game competitivly but still cant buy and sell to get cards.  Why bother play against bots. Headache thus this review.
I do not recommend this level of a headache. Go play elder scrolls legends if you havent already. Valve trade system stinks.
Will change to positive if and when I have a positive expereinc.
What a disgrace of a company and a spiteful spit in the face to anyone who brought their product. So I pre-ordered artifact thinking it would be great, I remember saying to my mates how a $30AU game should mean no more paid for packs and it will just be this solid fun card game. Plus the game mechanics looked very unique so I was very keen to dive into another fun card game. Let's start with the absolute joke of a disclaimer at the start saying if you play this game you can't refund, THIS SCREAM REFUND AND SOMETHING SUSS, what game that the devs believed in and thought was fantastic would they even need to put something like that in it? A very very dirty tactic and I for one didn't even see the message that's how small it was. Then you go on to found out that this game you paid $30 is also a pay to win game. Packs cost money, cards cost money, ranked mode cost money, arena ripped off from hearthstone cost money. This is literally hearthstone (FREE GAME) money tactic on steriods.

Now the game play, executed so poorly. Games take up to an hour long, and this includes your two forced bot games at the start. 'Minions' just seem to be random how many you get and what lane they go to instead of being a set amount each round. You can only choose you hero's lane to deloy to but not the slot in that lane which takes out heaps of out play tactics. Honestly, I played hearthstone years ago and was hooked from my first game for a long time, but this game can't even keep me interested for one game it's shocking. It has some good ideas like earning gold to buy shop items during the match, and the different colors do have their own play styles but when it's paid to win you can't even experiment with that your forced with whatever colored cards you were given. 

After such a disgusting dirty marketing tactic for valve to line their own pockets I look at them even lower then EA now which is saying a lot. I won't be buying any valve titled game again and I strongly suggest that you don't buy this game and do yourself a favor.
As a 20+ year CCG player I really wanted to like this game and had great hope for it but Artifact is not living up to it's expectations:
- Tool SLOW and too DRAWN OUT: with similar deck stregth and skill level the game becomex a long slug fests of attrition with little to no excitment in the end-game. Heal-buff-Heal-buff-play card-buff. This can literaly go on for 30-45 minutes by whcih time both Platers decks would have already cycled and there is no surprise left on eiether side witn eitehr Player just wishin the game will end
- litle card variety and limitted excitement in metagame especially compared to established CCGs
- the three lanes mechanic is a innovation but feels forced and overcomplicated again making games drawn out, adding some depth of startegy but in reality just adding unpredicatbility and frustration
- to many types of buffs which accumulate to quickly on individual heroes
Overall this game just does not feel fun, it feels like a chore and drags out. 

Crap... Complete crap... People moan that other card games are pay to win. This game you need to buy first and then put an absurd amount of money in to get any cards and even then, its no way near the amount you need so you can just buy the cards seperately on the market... axe is about £12 alone and thats not including all the other cards needed for just one deck. Stay away from this greedy piece of shit and go play a free to play card game thats not as greedy. Not only that but daaaamn the gameplay is so long and boring. I love dota 2 and hearthstone so i thought this would be a great game but i was very wrong. If you're not sure about getting the game... DONT!!!!!!!!!
Was really exited for this game, opened up Axe with the given packs. Sold it and made the deck I wanted. But after 6 hours I just dont want to play anymore. There isnt much you can do in this game. Cards dont allow you to experiment and honestly, matches are boring and it takes too long for my liking. I can buy packs or cards from the market place to make more decks but, why?

There is no progression, there is no incentive and I'm sure you are gonna think that playing the game should be the fun and important part not a progression system, but playing this game is so lonely while playing I just feel like I'm wasting my time. This game is more antisocial than hearthstone if that was even possible. No way to interact or react to your opponent. And without any progression its just feels like matches against bots and without good card synergy or experimental decks it just isnt worth the money.

Core game is good. But at this point I'd say instead of buying the game right now, wait for couple of expensions or updates.
As it stands, the game is pay to win. When your opponent has an Axe ($22 US) and a Tinker ($4.60 US), you're sure to lose unless you have something equivalent. Not an enjoyable experience. Wait and see how Valve deals with this nonsense before you buy!!!
Don't let the $20 price tag deceive you. This game costs $300 to play properly. If you can afford that, then you'll enjoy it. If you can't, you'll be beat by people who can.
Hearthstone is crap because Blizzard adds more and more RNG, rebalance arena to make it "fun" and no competitive. I bought Artifact for draft I got 12 wins easy in Hearthstone but there was no real competition or the market that makes draft best playable mod in Artifact. The problem is there are few cards so OP that you can't do anything against it except surrender and there are so many bad cards at a point you can't make a viable deck. There are few rules that should allow any player to make a correct draft deck but here if you get Axe gg perfect run if you get too much low tiers cards gg lose.

Heroes are OP but basic heroes are crap and in draft you just want to get Axe, Drow Ranger, Kanna, Lich, or Tinker but you have more chance to get Meepo or Necrophos forced pick who are worse than your basic heroes... even if you got nice cards crap heroes = lose just like in DotA. I almost forgot heroes can snowball with equipments that gives them more attack or health value every turn and Claszureme Hourglass lock all the cards your opponent draw. You think you can win without good heroes? Forget about it, there are big removals that clear your entire board, cards that make immune to damage all your creeps and heroes and there's Thunderhide pack who finish you off if you don't have slay to kill it.

What about constructed? You need expensive cards to make a viable deck and if you go expert you need a ticket that requires to transform cheap cards into it if you don't want to pay the full price at the shop. Yes you guessed it right, constructed is more P2W than Hearthstone and not fun at all gg Valve.
Thought this card game would be my dota replacement. At the start it's new, its fun. There are a lot of unique features such as no limit on creeps, 3 lanes and heroes. This allowed a lot of different strategies as a win condition. But there are many flaws that start to become apparent. The game feels as if though I have no control over the game. This is primarily due to RNG and the power difference between cards that make them garbage. There's many cards with RNG and other cards without RNG such as BM roar rellies on RNG due to unit placement. It's not that RNG is a bad concept, it's that RNG can be the factor to make you win or lose the game.
This suffers from the same problem that dota does, it's too long!! Games go for well over an hour!!! And you get nothing for winning other than a screen saying you won.

There is no competitive

There is no skill in deck building (go blue and spam Ignite or Conflagration, its easy and it stacks)

The only way to get cards is to buy them at a stupid price or pay to win

Theres a steep asking price of the game

I've ended up refunding the game until the issues are fixed, it feels like a cash grab by Lord Gaben
Our game is dying? Better reduce the amount of packs you start with from buying the game. What a shit show.
Honestly don't bother purchasing this, the community is steadily dying it will take a complete rework for them to actually fix the player base.
Newest update is definitely a step in the right direction. However, a lot of work still needs to be done. Once again pick it up if you're willing to dump some money to play constructed or $20 for unlimitted drafts and preconstructed. Mechanics are sound.
blatantly pay to win and 
is gambling. should straight up be illegal in the EU and valve should be punished for releasing a gambling machine disguised as a game

Never, in any game, have I witnessed such shameless money grabbing. Sure all card games are inherently expensive, but this game presents you with a no holds bar "Give us your cash or fk off" approach. I fully expected to dump some money into this game well beyond the 20$ purchase, such is the way of card games, but their approach is so aggressive and cheap it makes me not want to drop more money on it... and I had money set away for my initial investment... I just can't bring myself to do it. 

No way to grind out in game currency or cards! (No such thing as in game currency I might add) 
Competative games require paid entry
No log in bonus (acceptable, yet cheap) 
Nothing available for a one time purchase such as a starter bundle to get you going
Can't grind out card packs (Or anything for that matter)
Bought the game, had great expectations. But got refunded in the end. 

Actually, I really enjoyed the gameplay and the game looks beautiful. A tid bit confusing, but once I understood the mechanics, I got back on my feet and didn't lose a match.

But then I looked further and noticed that you cannot grind it, you must PAY PAY PAY to get your hands on all the sweet cards you want, and still pay to play competitively.

If this game crashs hard enough so that they change the way they handle the game economy, it will be fun to play. For now, this is a cash-grab. A beautiful, greatly built, cash-grab.

PS : will change review if positive changes are made to the game.
No point in playing this game after you use all your tickets.

Worth buying if they would give you just one free ticket a day, No point in buying it right now, without tickets all you can do is shitty drafts vs bots or get curbstomped vs people with your gimped deck because you got garbage from your 10 packs and would have to spend stupid amounts to get some good cards.
Game for pro players only. If you're a casual player, avoid it, there are better alternatives. Filled with so many mechanics, plenty of which are filled with RNG. Yes, maybe if you're in top 1% best players, you can nullify some of RNG by good plays, but the majority will get screwed by it in most games. Hero placement - RNG, minion placement - RNG, items in shop - RNG, lot of cards - RNG. Games feel like you just play ranom cards you happen to have mana for, that don't do much in most cases, because you got fucked by RNG. 
 Then there's monetization. One would think, you can get a decent deck by paying initial price. LOL, not here. But why would you need a deck anyway, if most people don't even play constructed, because it's boring and pretty fucking bad. I guess, if you have game so filled with RNG, you can just go all the way in by making draft modes the best way to play.
 There's one plus for this monetization model - you can make some steam bucks by selling cards you got from initial packs... but you probably won't, unless you were lucky to get some of the top priced cards. And if you buy the game and don't like it, you better fucking pray you get those cards to sell them, because guess what... Valve won't refund you, even if you didn't use tickets or opened the packs that come with the game.
'But sir, I like card games, the feeling of climbing the ladder, bulding my collection while playing, progress thorugh various in game quests or events.' Well fuck you then. No ladder, no way to earn anything or progress anywhere in this game. You want more cards? Pay. You want some kind of ladder or maybe even just a substitute? No ladder, any competitive modes are behind paywall. Don't you know we're in the 90s, where we play just for fun? Honestly, it maybe wouldn't be bad, a game without carrot on a stick, game you just play to relax and have fun... problem is, the game isn't fun. Every match is 30 minutes RNG fiesta.
 I bought the game with knowledge about it's monetization model, so it's not that big of a factor for me here. I just thought it's gonna be fun to jump in sometimes and play. Like, come on, it's Valve, they make good games, right? Fuck me, was I wrong. It seems like all the pros, streamers and personalities jumping to the game was for the same reason - 'It's gonna be huge, it's Valve'. Well, It's not huge, but it is Valve - and that's the only reason this game isn't a laughing stock of gamers, be it for it's monetization or horrible gameplay. You can pick the reason... but it's probably both.
As of now this game is incredibly stingy. They charge you up front for less initial content than other card games (its competition) would give you for free, which I would have been fine with, if it were possible to get any form of prolonged content without needing to continue to pay. The only way to get cards for 'free' is to maintain a very very good winrate through the paid modes, of which the game gives you 5 tickets to start off with. Once those run out your only real options are to play constructed with what limited number of cards you have, or to play free draft. Many aren't going to be playing constructed anyway since it'll likely be dominated by people who paid in to get the meta decks anyway, so I highly doubt that'll be able to nurture a casual audience for longer than a month if not a week. 

As for the gameplay itself? Its alright, but due to how the gauntlets work with needing to average about a 75% winrate to get anything out of them, maintaining a normally respectable winrate ends up feeling like trash, making every loss feel worse than you'd expect. Add that to how time consuming this game is compared to most card games, and you have a recipe for a game that ends up not feeling relaxing in the slighest.
Simple and already seen game mechanics, much more oriented toward monetisation than tactical depth. Coming from a game designer like Richard Garfield, it's quite disapointing.
Eh, bare bones game modes. Poor card balance. Inability to gain cards other than by paying real money or drawing something super rare to trade on the market. Unlucky initial pack opening landed me with 20 common dupes and resulted in a rather small library.
Decent card game with terrible and archaic monetization model. Just because MTG forces you to gamble for objectively better cards doesn't mean that is acceptable. Would gladly pay more money for the base game + expansions if all cards were available. Current model barely belongs to a "free"2play game.
You have to spend money to get more cards. You can't get more cards unless you spend money. There's no progression. There's not even a daily reward system. The voice-acting sucks. This is the first legitimately bad game Valve made. Valve failed. We have all failed. Surf's down forever.
To have no ranking/ladder system in a competitive game like this is an absolut no go for me.
Furthermore the whole game is structured in a way that the majority of players sooner or later need to put money into the game, in order to get any new cards. thats just appalling.
PS: It has _way_ more rng than any other card game.


edit: 
just some thoughts  after watching "Reynad's Thoughts On Artifact | Game Review"-video: 
i think he has a valid point with the following. handing out cards for free would devalue every card in the game and should not happen, right? he thinks that every card is owned through money is a great plus of the game.
I wanted to love this game, but in the end it failed to deliver. If you are not playing draft the game is very much p2w. It isn't bad, but it isn't good. I'd say it is the best digital CCG, but it for sure is the most unique. That being said I don't care for it.
Garbage game half life 3 died for this! Hitman also bought this game and was very excited but after playing it he also agreed it was rather shallow and uninteresting.
Who wants to play a game where you can only play if you buy stupid tickets, every other game option is pointless, meaningless, and unfun. Why did you waste time into this? Money?
The Game itself is VERY GOOD but the monetisation scheme is terrible!
I will be ready to change this review to positive when they implement some sort of progression and rewards without paying additional money.
Valve is being too greedy here!!!
I'm actually fine with the way this game is monetized, reminds me a lot of MODO. The mechanics of Artifact itself are awesome too, fun game overall.

However, currently I do not see much of an incentive to play more than the occasional round with a friend here and there. What Artifact is sorely missing is some kind of fun singleplayer content that tells a cute story or does some fun things, along with offering some kind of progression. As is stands right now you're outdone by Hearthstone in that field by a mile, and if you want to compete in the online TCG market with a new IP, you gotta cover all your bases I feel.

Good luck with that Valve, you got a great base going here but as it stands it's nothing super special right now that would make me want to leave Shadowverse, HS or MTGA for that matter.
Interesting mechanics with fairly generic card abilities.  Did not get any starter packs or booster packs with purchase, only 4 heroes and 3 items.  Can't wait to rock a 7 card deck that shakes the meta to its core.

*edit* I did eventually get the starting cards that were promised.  

I would like to add that there is a lot more randomness in this game than I thought there would be.  Some specific examples are the way your heroes (initially) and creeps are deployed to random lanes, the fact that attackers can randomly swerve into something not in front of them leaving your plans in ruins, and then there are the cards like cheating death that can win you the game on a virtual coin toss.  I won my last draft game purely due to winning 4 coin tosses in a row with this card.

I'm not saying the game doesn't take skill to play.  I'm saying that the randomness can trump your skill in too many ways.
i dont know, the gameplay is solid and its a decent card game, but i cant recommend paying 20 dollars for it. theres pretty much 0 progression to be made unless you throw real money at the game. most of the cards can be bought individually and most of them sell for about 25 cents aside from like 10 or so cards that are going from 5-20 dollars. id say the very large majority of decks youll see other players using are red decks that were copy and pasted from some website so theres very little variation in the matches. im sure down the road this game will be pretty good but for now its not worth spending money on in my opinion.
I don't feel happy when I get no valuable cards and the Axe is more expensive than all cards I have. 
The money I spent in the Artifact is about $70, and the most valuable card of mine is Legion Commander. 
I'm REALLY NOT happy playing the game, although the game itself is interesting.
It was a fun and very interesting take on a card game but then I try to play online and Boom!, I no longer have access and it says to check my internet connection over and over again. After doing so and ensuring that everything else is working properly I still have the same problem and I am unable to play online still yet. 

UPDATE!!

After contacting Steam and reaching out for a solution to the problem I had it took them 3 days to contact me back with a solution that only consisted of checking if my internet was connected to my computer.... which was an obvious yes. I still can not play the game online and I have still yet to receive a solution to said problem I would not recommend this product to anyone period as the experience you will have is sub-par at best. On top of the oh so excellent support you will have if you have an issue with the game at all.
As a huge MTG and DoTA 2 fan, I was hoping I'd enjoy this game, but in it's current state it's not very fun. It has some cool mechanics like lock which prevents cards in their hand from being played so it serves as a soft discard. While I hope Valve can make something of this, I don't know if this is the game for me. I made the mistake of opening my packs with the game so I wasn't able to refund it so I guess I'll see if it's any good with some time.
Its very much P2W - I wish I didnt get it.   If you like all aspects of MTG, including buying alot of packs/boosters than you might enjoy this.  I used to love MTG and other such cards games, and spent a pretty penny on them, but with work and kids now I dont have time.  

This really is just a MTG style of game - I would rather just play MTG......

Wasnt for me, you might enjoy, but be ready to drop lots of $$ to enjoy any of it.
I was interested in the free drafts, however everytime I make a draft pick the game freezes on up with a "Please wait" that never goes away.  Since I can't use the one portion of the game I was interested in, I requested a refund.  Apparently doing the tutorial involves opening product, even though all the packs I got for purchasing remain unopened, so they refused my refund request.
+ dota-like game play in card game (fresh idea)
+ we have an option to buy the exact card you need


- Too long game session
- PC client only, why not put it at tablets at least?
- the community has not believed (Valve needs to something right now)

+/- it might be an lesser money eater than others (e.g. in HS for 60 packs I got 1/3 cards for the lastest expansion, so how much you need to spand to get the desired set that you will use from time to time because of dailyquests?) BUT we have not seen the game evolition (new expansiion, season, whatever it calls). There might be an aggressive armament race in future.
Never to buy this game.

No skills needed, all you need to win the game is the luck of card drops.
CENSORED! 
Terrible management of community bulletin board by the moderator.
Thread will be stopped by the moderator , if you comment any bad criticism on this game.
They will block the bad criticism as "troll"!
This game is fun and unique but it is 100% pay to win. 20 dollars isn't a lot but there is also no progression without extra money on top of that. Totally disappointing.
This game is ok to be honest, but i can't reccomend it. Money sink,  little reward, repetitive, and not many cards, as well as the cards not having much depth.  Stick with Magic the Gathering Arena, they mastered the Genre.
No progression. On top of that this game is a solid 50% luck maybe 70%, that's just from my own experience atleast. But at this point I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, especially at it's price.
Former HEX: Shards of Fate player here. I don't have any problems with the monetization with this game. I usually spend a lot on games and a full set of cards right now is around $200. Also the initial $20 will give you plenty of choices for infinite game play depending on which mode you select. 

The gameplay just isn't fun! I have no desire to log back in to play any of the modes. The MOBA, Three-Lane style is innovative but doesn't click with me. Creep RNG and battle direction RNG is bizzare at best. Matches take WAY TO LONG!!! Animations take too much time and game timers are too lenghty. There's none of the tension, excitement, and anticipation with Artifact that I've experienced with other TCG's.

There's no interaction with your opponent and no chat in game, so no community. The current game modes are plentiful, but none of them have really sparked a connection with me. 

To be fair this could be a game that really needs several hundred hours of experience to appreciate. There's simply nothing about Artifact gameplay that gives me the desire to continue.
At this moment i don´t recommend this game to any friend, there is a LOT to improve in the game to be worth your time.
The game need casual and expert rank
Need some way to encourage you to keep playing, quests, skins, cards, tickets, gold, sleeves, sprays...anything!
Chat ¬¬ (c´mon that´s basic and should be in the game day one)
Balancing (cards like axe or drow are pure bullcrap)
TOO MUCH RNG!!! The rng in this game goes to increase your damage, to double your cards to even cheat death...RLY?!...RLY!!! ¬¬

Don´t get me wrong the game is good and has potential, but it has too many flaws right now...So just wait.
Artifact is well intentioned, has unique features, and decent gameplay; but falls apart completely in the balance, metagame, and reasons-to-play department.

This game should never have cost anything, especially considering it's got one of the worse 'free to play' models despite not being free.

The latest update did add in-game chat, and it being a Valve game there is a promise of long-term support and eventually, maybe, finishing this game's other features.

But that will likely never reach the level of fairness that, for instance, DOTA has enjoyed, because its fundamental design is one in which players are expected to pay for cards in order to play; a practice which absolutely killed the game at launch, and will continue to indefinitely. 

Comparing this, again, to DOTA; this game takes a world and community that is accustomed to having free access to all game-altering elements, putting them in-game, and making all monetization purely cosmetic... and it completely ignores everything about those design choices, and forgets why they worked so well. It's hard to see these choices as anything but egotism and greed, and it reflects poorly on Valve as a studio.

Hopefully enough will change in the coming months to justify updating this review. Until then, this game is not worth the base price, let alone the excessive additional costs necessary to actually build a usable deck.
It sounded good, it looked good, turned out awful , if something can be done wrong for a card game, valve did it and everyone knows it , the problem is because everyone knows it valve will probably drop it and do nothing to fix this. RIP
Just No. 

The game is a fun enough game, but the monotization sceme sucks. First you need to buy in and once you did you need to buy packs to play competatively. Unlike say Hearthstone, there is no way to unlock free card packs or earning some kind of in game cash to buy card packs. If you want to expand your collection beyond the base card set you get, you'll need to pay up. 

Valve fix your monotization and you'll probably have a good game, as it is now, stay away from this P2W game.
TLDR: This is the 1st and only game that I have asked for a refund on.

I enjoyed the actual game mechanics. Sadly the game crashed after every match and the sound was constantly bugged out. Worst monetization of this game style.  This is some EA style greed here...
80% of the playerbase is gone.
The game is great but it's an RNG fest that can only be mitigated if you are a skilled player so casual players will probably never be good enough to overcome the amount of coinflips. 
The economy is great if you love playing Draft and Awfull if you love playing constructed ( because the only way to have a cheap constructed collection is when the player base is living -> prices go down).
Long story short, what a shame, it had potential.
Also Cheating death + Drow in every green deck ruined the fun for me

Update Edit  (Jan 2019):
The new + :
- hero balancing is getting much better now (hi drow ranger)
- ranking and player progression is now a thing
-seems like they are willing to update the game frequently to answer the players concerns.
- steam Market card value dropped like crazy so you can get a whole collection for less than 200$. 

The new - :
- mono blue meta everywhere ( super control heavy decks) = 45 min games in case of mirror
- big streamers leaving the game.
- amount of concurrent players drastically low (much less than 20k), it means that you have a higher chance of queuing against top players and niibs alike.

Unchanged :
- some retarded effects still unchanged like Oggre Magi multicast being a game breaking 25% rng effect. Its completely crazy in a control monoblue meta.
- unrelated to the game itself but twitch viewerships at around 6k during peak hours... Not good at all.
I thought i would try it seeing i liked most of the games Valve have done in the past but i gotta say this game sucks hard.
My advice would be play hearthstone its much more fun and at least you can earn cards on it
DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!

played now 40 hours. f2p draft is ok but why should i play this there is no reward??? not a rank nothing. 
wait for sales or f2p. 

played almost all cardgames. hearthstone, magic, gwent, shadowverse (lol) etc. 
the concept is nice with 3 lanes but thats it.
boring cards with shit spells and average graphic effects. i think its the only game that dont show effects from cards.

cant wait for the 1 million dollar tourney with 5k viewers. playerbase is is not existent.
there are 2 type of players in this game. hearthstone apes where you win in 5 minutes or you get crushed. boring AF and not motivating at all. 


Needs some improvements. I bought it for a "Steam demo" and am now awaiting refund. Tutorial leaves a lot to be desired (doesn't really teach much...). The graphics (despite being on 1080 and max settings) are mediocre at best. The animations, while fun, eventually (quickly) become extremely tedious to sit through every round. I would only recommend this game to hardcore CCG players, it has potential, and I imagine if you're already skilled at other games it might not be so confusing, but as it sits... Beginners beware.
Turns out, even after the improvements, I never feel like playing the game. I can get past a rough start to a game, the market stuff and lack of progression. This is not a big deal but sadly the game is not that fun to play.

It really feels like the Dota 2 of card games. Games are too long for no reason and you often feel like you are not in control and losing because things you couldn't change yourself. I stand by the fact that this is a well tought game. It works, it's playable but it's just not enjoyable to me.

[strike]In the latest patch, they added progression and rewards, seasonal skill ranks and balance changes. Game is officially good now. Thanks Valve![/strike]
--------------------------
[strike]So Artifact is a good game. I don't think it's a surprise for anybody, and I think we all know that's not the controversial part.

The monetisation is the controversial part.
0 free to play content, everything has to be bought, a lot like any physical card game. Now, it's not all bad. Being able to straight up buy the deck you want without grinding is a good thing. Reclying is a good well integrated feature. But it comes with a couple of bad consequences.

[list]
    [*]It's very unlikely that they will balance or ban cards if they become a problem because it would screw the peoples who bought those on the market. I've always said the biggest strenght of digital card games is that they can rebalance the cards at will. It has little consequence on players since they can recycle their cards (some games like Eternal even refund full value when they nerf a card) and they don't have to ban a card or wait months or years for the set to rotate out. Artifact is probably locked out of this option so problematic cards are here to stay. They might do it, but it's very unlikely and I wouldn't assume they will.
    [*]Expert mode feels very bad to play if you are not a very good player. Expert mode has constructed or draft, you need to pay to start a run, play untill you get 5 wins or 2 loses and get rewards if you scored at least 3 wins. After the very first day of release, I only played against very good players with amazing drafts or T1 constructed deck. I don't mind playing for money from time to time but if it's always open like this, only top players are gonna be there and it's just not worth to do. I'd be curious to see temporary events with tickets with incentives for a lot of players to join in.
    [*]The alternative is Casual play. Basically, play for free but without any rewards. You can either play single games or gauntlets. So... it's gool just to play the game but it feels kind of pointless to play. Your options are pretty much play for money or play for fun. MMR is invisible, no ranked ladder or anything.
[/list]

I'm looking forward to see how they handle this game because it's very good and a lot of it is done right like free Phantom Drafts and Social Tournaments. But (likely)no balance in fear of screwing the market, betting against top tier players and no ladder is just too much. I hope this game improves and I'll be sure to check back this review if it does.[/strike]
It is a very confusing and boring gmae.. One match last tooooo long, and in 1st few matches you already feel what money can give you..You just cant compete as f2p player. " tutorail games you have to play will take 1 hour of your day to finish it. Who the fuck wants to play 1 match of card game for more then 30-40 min..and its against bots, real game can go for much much longer. Very disappointed I would never recomend it to anyone.
theres alot wrong with this game and alot has already been touched upon so i wont touch on those. My main issue is the running requirements. I have a gaming desktop at home that runs this absolutely fine but thats not why i bought a online card game. For me i wanted a quick easy to run thing that i could play on my notebook in beteen classes and in other down times. I have no clue why this game has way higher running requirements than any other card game out there. its a card game. i shouldnt need a quad core to run it. update the game with a low spec option please. this games only shot at coming back is being made more easily accesible. ie lower running requirements or a phone port and a major change to the price of the game. I understand you cant make it free because people will just make new accounts to sell their cards and ruin  the market place but why not just make your starter packs untradeable? theres seems to be no reason for some simple fixes and it dissapoints me that this card game is failing so hard.
It is ok. The game is fun to play in a sense except its randomness. Now players still need to buy cards which are not that expensive compare to the price at the beginning. I still don't recommend because...I hope you guys, all the new players can make Valve to learn that card games should be free to play like Gwent or Hearthstone. For old players like me, we choose to die with this game.
too much rng everywhere (u cant even place Heroes the just spawn anywhere on the Lane)
p2w (No Quest no Achiements no Daily Login Reward nothing)
unbalanced as hell.. it needs a lot of balance
feels unfinished everywhere 
no spectator mode

i just bought this bec im a Valve Fan or i was... really dissapointed.
Feels like one of the Big Gamestudios who were the Good joinen Ea.

Overall i had a few Fun Rounds and i hope Valve takes this as Warning Shot.
Hope you build it to a good Game.


Setting aside any comments on the monetization scheme here's my thoughts.

First off I do appreciate how the three lane approach and shop system give this game a distinct feel and that's a big part of what encourage me to give this a solid go. It's not a bad game at all but it is really slow and I don't mean that it simply takes a while to play the a match. I wouldn't have an issue with a fourty minute game if there wasn't any down time in it. There are plenty of times when you just don't have anything you can do on a turn so you're forced to end your turn, wait for someone to play a card, end your turn wait for someone to play a card - sometimes going through that cycle four or five times each time having to wait for all the animations and everything to play through just to get to the next lane.

My second big issue is that there's just too much RNG. Random card draws are fine, even having cards with random percentage effects is fine, then your heroes location within a lane is random which is less fine but still doable but then... even then your heroes/creeps are assigned to targets randomly every round so your entire strategy can get screwed because of the targetting spread it chose for you.
- Solid Mechanic
- OKish Implement
- Monetize system give zero reward over casual.
- thus, casual will have no incentive to play in the meantime.
- Worst card design; Low Synnergy and Combo mean Better card / Counter deck won.
- Lack of cool / meme card = no fun.
- No control over spawn/targeting.
- that make game kind of annoy in competive match.
- Unstable connection window mode.
- Headache UI (especially when swing between table).
- Late game board is totally a mess.
- Some color are not compatible in draft make it more RNG .
(Draft is RNG base but it should be fair between color)
- RNGsus for random and some spell 50% win / 50% just waste mana.
- P2W otherwise card market value should be close to each other (typical in TCG).
- just like other early TCG, card pool is still pretty low and it's not FUN to play/play against same deck again and again and again.
Boring to play and to watch. This isn't just pay2win this is pay4everything, if you ever want to expand your collection welp I hope you got cash to either buy packs or to do drafts to get play for packs. Yeah there are phantom drafts where you don't need to pay for anything, but you don't grow your collection with them, it honestly feels like I'm wasting my life for nothing.

Single cards can range from 0.4 cents a card to over $20 for one card wtf. A shame that the game is going down like this, a real shame. O and if you plan on trying out the game yourself, DO NOT OPEN YOUR 10 PACKS GIVEN AT THE START, for some retarded reason you can't refund the game if you opened them. I guess locking those cards after the refund would have been to hard for them. 04/10 I want a refund Valve
The most mediocre trash card game I have seen in my entire life which explains why they made the damn tutorial last 2 hours. I should have listened to all the reviews, including one by Forbes, which all say that the game is a doomed pile of trash. Not suprising given that this kind of garbage is Valve's specialty. I especially love how they decided to one up an ingame store by making card packs only available for purchase for real money with no way to earn them for free except for the 15 packs & even tickets you get for leveing up to level 16... If I pay $20 for a game I expect it to be playable without further in game purchases because the pay to win style is only acceptable for free to play games. I mean the whole thing is just rediculous so please listen to me and other negative reviews and just play virtually any other card game out there - I reccomend Thronebreaker or Hearthsone which are both a dozen times better than this absolutely unforgivable garbage. It might work if Valve seriously changes Artifact's economy and also improves on balancing the cards because right now the gameplay also seems... forced? Not sure how to describe it but it feels artificial, forced, and very poorly balanced as far as some mana costs for several cards and fortifications.
Boi, is this game riddled with problems. How do you screw up a card game that is based off Magic: The Gathering, Dota and Hearthstone/Shadowverse game mechanics? Why are you pulling an EA on your consumers Valve? And holy bitch, why are you so arrogant & stubborn Richard Garfield?

[h1]Starting the game[/h1]
When you start the game for the first time, you get a few card packs and 5 tickets. If you don't get extremely lucky and pull some insane cards (yeah good luck with that) you can forget about playing with your own decks as you will have your ass handed to you by people who paid for more cards and have optimized decks. So you can basically forget about playing Constructed until you get more cards. The other gamemode is Draft. Which is like the Arena mode. Open a few packs, pick you cards and play with those. Simple. Though, I recommend practicing in casual mode, before going into ranked, because playing ranked isn't free in this game. Yes, the ranked gamemode, the only gamemode with some sort of rewards, is not free.

[h1]Earning cards & exploitative monetization[/h1]
How do you get more cards, you ask? Is there a shop which lets you exchange your in-game currency? Nope. What in-game currency? The only way to get more packs is either through paying with real money or winning against other players, while not losing yourself. You can either pay 2$ for a single pack of 10 cards or go through the Steam market and buy cards off of other players (which is more profitable, if you actually plan to pay). I mentioned that you can earn packs by winning games, but in order to receive a single pack you first must spend a ticket, which are also bought by real money or created through destroying 20 of your cards to get a single ticket... And now you have to play and win. Lose 2 times and your current run is over. In order to "recover" your ticket you have to win at least 3 out of 5 games. 4 wins gives you a ticket and pack, while 5 an additional pack. To receive the most basic thing in Artifact, cards, you have to play damn fucking well or you get nothing. Unless you pay of course and Valve would be very happy if you did that :^) 

[h1]The RNG[/h1]
There are so many elements of this game that are outside of the players control. These aren't even fun or wacky RNG effects like Heartstone has. This RNG isn't the type of RNG you can make a funny montage of. This is just problematic and frustrating RNG. So many coinflips that can absolutely win or lose you games. And with so much on the line, losing in Artifact feels absolutely bad. Creeps spawn each turn in random lanes,  shop randomly generates different items each turn, heroes are placed on random position's when there are multiple available on a single lane, the arrows which control the character's attacks are random, many effects and cards that have a 25% or 50% chance to work. A single game of Artifact can last up to 40+ minutes. If you lose a game due to RNG, it will fucking sting. 

[h1]Other problems & lack of fundamentals[/h1]
Even if you overlook how Artifact handles its cards & microtransactions, this 20$ game, really doesn't offer a lot. Gamemode wise, it has what every other card game with microtransactions has (major difference being that a lot of those card games are free and have some system to allow free to play players a way to play & compete against paying players). Outside of having little to no reward system, this game doesn't even have even the most fundamental things other digital card games come equipped with: 
[list]
[*]No progression system (outside of the account leveling system, which was implemented months later after the launch), 
[*]No way to keep track of winrates 
[*]No way to keep track of card playrates 
[*]No statistics for either gamemode
[*]No way to look up what kind of other decks other players might be playing
[/list]

[h1]Final words[/h1]
The only good thing about the game I can say are the visuals, music & sound effects, but those aren't  elements that can save a game's shitty gameplay. Until Valve fixes some of the core issues with this game or implements more interesting things, instead of just trying to ride off the popularity of other digital card games, I really don't recommend this game. Will Valve continue updating this game and implementing new features or will they abandon this game just like the majority of the playerbase, if it becomes unprofitable? Who fuckin' knows  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ? Go play Hearthstone or Shadowverse instead. There are probably more options. And no doubt are they better than this lol. Ya dun goofed up Valve. Could have invested the money that went into this into Half Life 3 instead lel.
The basic gameplay itself is fine, even if it could have done with a bit of streamlining at the edges. I've enjoyed my time with the game both playing at a friend's place, and now that the game is out, on my own copy. But I don't know how much longer I'll keep playing.

The game desperately needs progression mechanics and being able to earn cards and rewards in-game by playing. Right now the only option is to pay cash money, and there's a lot of pressure to do so, because many apparently have done so -- and are at a significant advantage due to some seemingly questionable card balance choices.

Right now Artifact is a solid starter. The game looks gorgeous, feels great, has a good atmosphere and mechanics which differ enough from the Hearthstones and Magics of the world to earn it a spot on the map. Valve need to update the game and add in features they promised during the beta but still haven't delivered on, rethink the progression mechanics and take a look at the balance. 

A lot to ask for, but Artifact could be a winner if they do. Right now, I'd probably advice to wait and see.
buy this game open 10 pack, full of crap then u can uninstall 
noway to optain new card beside play gaunlet match that cost u ticket guess what ticket cost 2$ to play, yeah now i want to refund
NOTE IF YOU TRY TO REFUND THE GAME VALVE WILL DENY IT BECAUSE CARDS ARE TIED TO YOUR ACCOUNT. THIS IS THE PRIMARY REASON I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME.

Valve initialy pitched this game as a card game that you would not need to buy cards in, all microtransactions were going to be cosmetic. Problem is, this never came about. The game is obviously tied to buying card packs and you can expect to spend $300+ to get the cards you need. This price point is much above other games within the genre, where you can expect to pay ~$200 per expansion.

The game itself plays ok, revolving around four schools: Black (Assassin/Gold Gain), Blue (Magic/Control), Red (Brawl/Ramp) and Green (Support).  You can also, get items for heroes, basic minions and improve your turret/lane. That gets into the other part of the game, your win condition is to destroy two turrets or the enemies ancient (exposed by destroying a turret). You play on three boards/lanes and use mana as a resource like in hearthstone. The game is lacking in depth, though this will change with additional expansions. All the starter decks are trash. The game is going to need about a year for it to actually get fun and half your cards will probably be out of rotation by then or you will be so behind the paywall you will never catch up. If you like card games, I'd probably say wait or just don't bother.

I was looking forward to this one but I was suddenly suprised to notice that it had the monetary system attached and was disappointed it would not refund because I had opened my packs.
Cannot recommend it in its current form. The single and only way to get cards is to buy them or buy packs. There is no progression system, you earn nothing by playing.

Additionally, there is no means of communicating with opponents, which makes it frustrating when an opponent will wait til last minute to do anything (there is a timer, but each round grants extra time and there are parts such as the round begin which do not use the timer at all).

The game itself is fun and feels tactical. There is an element of RNG which is frustrating, but not gamebreaking. 

In short, it is a good game marred by it's obescenely aggressive monetization strategy (it is clear that Valve is hoping to replicate the CSGO and TF2 markets by encouraging buying and selling of cards).

I'm frankly disappointed in Valve, this feels like something out of EAs playbook.
Anyone attempted for refund?

They didn't give me refund after couple of hourss (Their policy says 2 hours) and the game locks for at least 3 hours on tutarial so can't even go into game to see what it is before refunding. This is so stupid
Got it because there is a free draft unlike in Hearthstone and the price felt okay for that, but the gameplay disappointed me with the unnecessary RNG where there could've been more strategy. It's a shame when the game seemed to aim to be less casual.

It also feels uninspired to reuse so many generic mechanics from other card games in the first set instead of exploiting the new board and phase design more, I'd argue that those two barely affect things when the gameplay in the end mostly becomes the same buff and damage number crunching exercise as the rest.
I heard someone saying that this game has a little amount of RNG: funniest moment of my week. The RNG in this game is just crazy and has a huge impact on every single match - but the large number of options and decisions at your disposal gives you the illusion of control. You have to make lot of choices and this is nice, sure, and may make you think, at first sight, that all that bad RNG (a cheap one indeed) could be not that much important in the end. False. Don't misunderstand me: I'm not saying this game doesn't require skill or ability: it does. It's a very "deep" game, it's complicated and tend to punish you very hard for your mistakes, but... deployment, shop items, card draw (oblviously), attack direction, spells effects, heroes abilities: the RNG is everywhere. Everywhere. And sometimes even a single, little, stupid episode can lose you the game. A very long game.

Yeah, because this is not (nor is intended to be, of course) a "casual, friendly, card game". Matches tend to be very, very long - requiring attention, concentration, knowledge. It's nor good nor bad, per se: it's just a matter of taste. And obviously... it's terrible on Twitch. 

Esthetically... ahn, it's fine, I guess? Perfect animations, very cool UI (imho), but the cards are really bland. The art is honestly kinda poor if compared to others CCG - but again: it's not the most important thing in a card game, probably. So... eh, ok. Nothing special, nothing terrible. Oh, and I love the soundtrack! 

Monetization. *Sigh* I don't really know. A little bit ("bit") too greedy? Maybe?

Overall, not my cup of tea, sadly. Some cool ideas, a few flaws, a crazy amount of RNG, average graphics, very very expensive. Go for it ONLY if you are a very skilled (ehi, self-critical moment number one: try to be honest with yourself) and a very patient (self-critical moment number two: are you sure?) kind of player and if you want to invest some money in this (no, they won't refund you anything: they warned you. Packs are tempting, I know, but they warned you). 

Best luck. :3
I was looking for a game which was less rng and less pay to win then hearthstone and was utterly disappointed in that regard. The swing turns are often due to rare cards. This makes it really annoying because it means, that you didnt lose against a better player but rather against someone who was willing to pour money into the game.

When it comes to RNG I think this game is worse than Hearthstone. With the spawns, the arrows and the shop there is more RNG going on without playing any cards than in some Hearthstone games. If you add dumb stuff like the Golden Ticket or Cheat Death to it, the game can get infuriating really fast.

Overall I regrett my purchase and wouldnt recommend it to anyone who is looking for a Card Game that is not massively RNG based and pay to win.
This is by far the worst Digital TCG i have ever played if im going to have to spend so much to play the game i would rather just buy real cards and play magic. To clarify mechanicly it seems fine but theres no reason to keep playing. There is no way ro get cards without spending money and there is no real incentive to keep playing since the game doesnt seem to have anything to work towards other than spend more money on cards. if you are looking for a decent TCG to waste some time playing on PC without wasting your money this isnt it.
I never post opinion, but here I must, cause this game is litterraly Pay2Play ... even after buying the game.
So if you don't plan on investing money in your 'fake/unreal' cards, don't buy it.
Not to mention that if you don't pay or get luck opening your boosters, it is Pay2Win.

On the other hand, the gameplay is great, but with such a card concept, it's totally broken and ridiculous...

There could be more to say, but that's far than enough to summary the game imo.
Despite the 20 dollar entry and only means for more cards being threw spending more money. I thought the game looked like it had enough complexity and layers to it that it would keep me entertained for sometime down the road. (tend to lose interest in games like hearthstone and elder scroll legends due to them becoming too rng based or too simple) So far I have to say im not impressed atall. This is mostly due to the HUGE lack of balance between cards. its silly, near insanity, just straight bonkers! BOO!
Wow I can't believe how terrible the monetization of this game is. There is no way to earn cards except by spending real money. Learn from Gwent Valve, you idiots.
One year ago, I quited hearthstone because Blizzard wants to teach me how to play my own game, I don't feel comfortable to continue even though i spent thousands dollars. Now artifact is much more greedy to make people spent money. Please let icefrog in charge of Artifact, Dota2 is stil the best model for all game, GabeN!
So... If someone asked me to describe an online CCG that was irritating, annoying, kind of fun to play, sort of reminds me of MTG and is a very obvious cashgrab like anything by EA I would say... try Artifact! Graphics aside ( beautiful to look at) this game is an Anna Kournikova, lot's of potential, beautiful to look at, but ultimately no real substance. It's quite obvious that the goal is to spend more or suffer "Death By a Thousand Paper Cuts". Unfortunately this is the trend... i'm out after my initial spend.
I am fan of all card games, from yugioh to magic and then to hearthstone. I was expecting ALOT from Artifact given the hype but 4 hours into this game and I am thoroughly disappointed. Here are the list of reasons why.

1. Game mechanics is too complicated for its own good. There's no synergy between cards, and certain spells are way way useless than others. If they do it like Hearthstone but with heroes cards, it may probably be a better game.

2. Depends too much on RNG. Results: RNG, long duration games, complicated mechanics, useless cards for f2p players = everyone gets bored after beating the bots. (I got bored after 3 hours)

3. There is no achievement, no weekly or daily missions to help you collect cards. EVERYTHING IS P2W. You wanna play? Sure. you pay. Call to arms constructed cards are useless af, and phantom draft does not allow you to earn free cards. The only way to get cards? Pay. No more tickets? Pay.
Played a few games. Couldn't get into it. Nothing sucked me in. Pay barriers made me not want to do certain things which might have been fun. The managing 3 boards thing feels unnecessary, some junk they carried over from DOTA2 because reasons. Some extra randomized elements felt like they took control away from the player and gave it to chance. Would rather play Hearthstone, Gwent, or Magic.
Spent money for the game. Spent an extra 10 on packs..... literally wasted my money can't even build a deck that beats bots wihtout out shopping the market. Why not just let me spend that 20 + 10 dollars on cards that are actually useful to build a deck rather than RNG. This is by far the most greediest Valve game I have played. I hope it fails.
I wanted to love this game, but there are too many issues with it and I have zero trust in Valve handling this. It's a shame because it's a smear on their otherwise untarnished record. Here's my story:

Bought three copies of a card called cheating death. They cost $2 a piece, meaning to spend $6 I had to dump $10 into steam. 

Made a deck, get prompted to update as I try to join a game. Ok. Update.
Relaunch client and get into a game.
Cheating Death now has entirely different rules. 

Read update notes: you can refund these cards. Cool.
Check inventory on the 21st, no option to sell to valve/refund.

Apparently bought these cards *after* the announcement I didn't see because it wasn't made a mandatory read upon log in (as it should have been for all players.) Had I known this, obviously would not have bought the cards. I am apparently ineligible for refund even after explaining this in a support ticket.

Sell all my cards and go back to playing MTGA. Feels good man.
Despite of my last review, this game is pretty much unenjoyable now. Granted, in my last one, I said I enjoyed the game. Well, that is to say I think the concept is pretty neat in terms of gameplay styles, but then you see how very, very unbalanced a lot of these playstyles can be. 

Now, there could be an arguement stating that one would need the right cards to counter these styles. There lies the issue: In order to get the cards, you'd either have to buy a card pack in game, or buy them directly off the marketplace, and even then, some of the best cards can be well above the price of a standard cardpack in the game itself. Basically, if you don't have the right cards in your deck either from lack of spendable cash on hand or just unfornuate not getting one in a card pack, you're pretty much screwed.

TL;DR -
This game is not worth the 20$. This game needs adjustments to certain cards and how to obtain them.
Very cool basic rule engine. 
Best graphics in the genre.
Very polishied.
BUT
While it had deep strategy and it tries to be competetive in the sense the RNG factors can create huge swings in the game. Which just feels bad.
Bad balancing. Card balance is just some of the worst in the genre among popular alternatives.
Some horrible card design. Well if you read anything about the game you have surely heard about the outcry against cards like Cheating death. It is a card that is so poorly designed I don't know what the developers where thinking.
No, just no. Don't play this copycat. There is nothing new, exciting, thrilling in this. Everything has been there before, in Magic, Hex, Hearthstone and Gwent. Artifact feels like they just stirred up these games. The gameplay is extremely boring but on the other side one gets easily overwhelmed by the chaos going on. The time and money commitment to play a competitive match is too high. On top of that, the economy is bound to the steam market which will result in a large bubble, so don't even think about investing.
As others have said, there exists no mechanic to gain additional cards outside of cash which is very disappointing. 

Game play is complex and will depth but until you sink a ton of money, it's an echo chamber. Once they add in some card aquisition method (no matter how slow) outside of cash, I would play it again.
I miss the old Valve, makes fun games accessible to all Valve
The Indie dev that was small Valve, not hiding their gameplay behind a paywall Valve

I hate the new Valve, charges you for the ingredients, the recipe, and the oven for your cake Valve
Got greedy and takes a 15+% rake Valve, using Hearthstone streamers to create hype that is fake Valve

I miss the sweet Valve, not afraid to drop you a hat Valve
Making new friends in their games through chat Valve, before their wallets got too fat Valve
The game just isn't fun. 

There's glimmers of potential buried deep, deep in there, but it's not worth digging for. Chunks of the game are spent not being able to do anything, literally, because the easiest way for your opponent to counter you is to remove your ability to play cards in a lane. Creeps are controlled by random arrows, so sometimes they attack intelligently, and sometimes they gang up on the same creature to deal 20 damage when it has 2 health, and attacking the tower could win the game. As an example of the many ways the design goes wrong. 

On top of that, Valve adamantly refuses to communicate. We have no idea what, if anything, they're doing to fix things. Up until Jan 24, 2019 they'd at least pushed out a minor patch a week, and then they didn't, and no one knows if it's because they didn't have anything, or they gave up, or it didn't get finished, or what. 

Do not recommend. Check back in six months at a minimum, on the off-chance the game seems interesting to you. It's not worth it right now.
The actual gameplay and mechanics are excellent. This is a brilliantly designed game that allows for a lot of strategy and the ability to 'outplay' at multiple stages of the game. It's really exciting and interesting to play. Much deeper than hearthstone, as deep or deeper than MTG (with less randomness).

However, the monetization and balance issues (which are caused by the monetization) are crippling this game which is sad, as it would otherwise be an absolute gem and a huge hit.

I can't approve in its current state.
This is so bad. The game is not fun at all. Don't buy this. Developer had figured this all out and gave 1 month DOTA plus which  HAS NOT BEEN USED but you still can't refund.
Caters to top 1% of players, to others its Pay to Play, you can play Draft/Arena for free, but there is no progression or rewards if you play without paying.

With 75% win rate you can keep playing without paying and earn some packs (cards) , but matchmaking is MMR based so , its trying to get you to face players of similar skill level, meaning experience/knowledge should not contribute towards winning games as much as the deck quality will do.

Also fact that u can't trade between friends is just ... yeah what a fuck
Not a fan of Artifact. I guess I've played too many TCG's. I do not need another one. And it's not even good looking, imo.

However, I am not allowed to refund. Guess why? Because I've opened some free in-game booster stack. Yay. 30 min in-game and unable to refund. Thank you Valve. I will never again play this game.
Unplayable for 20$
Your 20$ is buying your first set of cards. There doesn't seem to be a good way to get more cards without spending more money. I guess if you're good you don't have to spend money to get more cards. You could just win at draft every time at least enough to get your event tickets back. But it seems like eventually everyone will have to spend money on this game to progress. I would say don't buy it unless you plan to spend more money. The game itself seems good. If I had unlimited money I would probably play this. Since I'm poor I just wasted 20$ /shrug
Worst card game ever
there is no free way to collect cards
and heros are unimbalanced.

The tutorial can take almost 2 hours, and after that, u won't be able to get the refund.
As a dota2 player, I am so disappointed
I would not recommend the game.
I pre-ordered and purchased 20 packs. This is effectively the price of AAA game and a reasonable amount to spend at launch.  So this isn't a gripe about the game costing money. The point is that this is basically a waste, since even playing a casual matchmaking, you are immediately matched with people who have spent considerably more. Literally the first casual match I played against, the guy had Axe (most expensive card in the game) and a bunch of other crazy stuff. If the idea is that people are going to spend several thousands dollars, like pro-tier MtG, simply to play casual, then quite frankly that's nuts.
Coming from a MTG, HearthStone, Yu-Gi-Oh, Duel Masters, DBZ CCG, deckbuilders, and many other [breakable] card games, this game is damn near unplayable. My biggest complaint is the core mechanics: a) they are not explained and b) you can not affect placement. 

Card placement - The game does not explain how minons spawn or why they go to the lane and spot that they do. After sending a Hero to a lane, you canNOT pick which slot it actually fights in. There is no timer or way to check how long your or your opponents' heros are dead for. When something dies, you cannot concolidate your cards to fill a gap, so if the enemy kills your card, it will continusly hit your tower; you cannot move a card to block.

Attacking - Why do some heros attack the card to the side instead of the open tower? Why doesn't Cleave stack only in some situations? It's never explained in game.

Top off of this off with a pay-to-cherry. YOU CAN ONLY GET CARDS BY PAYING REAL MONEY! So you have to BUY the game for $20, and then keep paying $2 PER PACK (10cards) or $1 for a tournament. 

*******THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY TO EARN CARDS WITHOUT PAYING REAL MONEY*****
 (besides winning a tournament....with cards you needed to buy to have a strong deck)

If they had a way to get cards like HearthStone or literally ANY other digital card game, I'd probly give this game a neutral.
Even after a few updates the game's model just isn't very good in the market it competes in. Perhaps it will change in the future but it may be too late.
I like the gameplay but this game is no where near finished. Lacks the basic features of other online card games. Might be good in 2 years. Don't buy it until then.
Buy 3 blink daggers and enjoy your near undefeatable deck.

Its just your typical bullshit pay to win card game where anyone with an infintesimally small shred of bad luck will never have fun in.

I wish I didnt waste my money on this garbage. Just another game to frustrate me.
BAD bad , nice trick with DOTA plus for ONE MONTH  - you cant return the game for refund if you already used the dota plus subsciption and not to  mention if you have sold some of the cards 

Doesnt deserve  even the review, but just to inform others if they intend buying this RUIN ! ! !
Constructed is basically unplayable unless you have the absolute meta decks through RNG or spending tons of money, so Phantom Draft (And Keeper Draft) are the only modes worthwhile playing.

And even then you have to hope that, upon winning, that it registers with the servers, or it'll count you as abandoning/leaving the game.
This game needs a way to earn all sorts of cards for free, and fairly quickly.

Add a progression or levelling system, don't make grinding take hundreds of hours. Please Valve, you have a good game with a terrible monetization system.
Terrible balancing, rng, Meta and Meta deck only or gtfo. Played 54hrs in a shortspan, regretted it cause skill doesn't matter. What you do in the beginning does not affect much into late game cause heroes respawn, the first couple rounds is just circlejerk.
Lots of potential, I saw it advertised/talked about as a more skill-based game than hearthstone, I was really disappointed to find out that the RNG involved was almost equally as bad as hearthstone. Definitely feels worse than even pokemon TCG coinflips. 

This an awesome game at heart and the RNG feels so out of place with the other mechanics in the game, really taking away from the experience.

Things that are decided by RNG
-Attack Targets
-Unit Placement
-Melee Creep Spawns
-Several different card mechanics (Bounty Hunter, Cheating Death, Intimidation, Eclipse, etc.)

You can outplay this sometimes if you have the cards to allow you to do so, but since this RNG takes place each turn you'll not be able to always do that. It's feelbad RNG, when you win because of it, it feels ridiculous, when you lose because of it, it's infuriating. The problem is exacerbated in draft where you can't reliably draft cards to counter the incredible amounts of RNG built into artifact as a game mechanic.

In it's current state, I wouldn't recommend playing it. I enjoy it, but it doesn't seem to offer a meaningful experience compared to other CCGs. The game has a lot of awesome ideas, and I'd love it if things like placement/targettingposition RNG was toned down, but currently, the RNG involved is so frustrating to experience on both sides that it's often unenjoyable far past the extent of something like getting "manascrewed" in MTG.
I will keep this short.

Add a ranked mode and a way of progression for free. Otherwise I will keep this downvoted.

The Game is so gorgeous and full of potential. The way you handle it is simply sad. Wake up Valve or just delete this Game. I you continue like this it'll die a much more painful Death.
I dont care about the financial model everyone is complaining about, as a rabid MTGA and Dota fan i really wanted to like this game.  

After watching a pro tournement, buying some cards, making a competitive deck, playing the competitive draft mode, buying more packs, and playing for about a week i sold all my cards and uninstalled.  

I dont know it just didn't grab me the way Dota or MTGA does.  Something about the amount of RNG in it, i felt like i was spending all my thought process trying to manage RNG.  Hope it gets better, but for now im out.
Do not buy this game. Monetization aside, it's just not good. Specifically:
[list]
[*] Games take a long time. Way too long.
[*] Results feel random. Randomness in attack direction and hero match up plays an outsized role in the game.
[*] No recovery mechanics. If you have an unlucky first turn and lose two heros, you're very likely to lose the game, as your opponent will not only be up heros, but have 10 gold to buy sweet items.
[*] Not enough common cards. After only three drafts, I can say I've memorized all common cards by heart. This makes drafts, and matches in draft, very boring.
[*] Drafts are very luck dependant, even more so than MTG or ESL, because of the hero mechanic. Get a great hero pack 1? You're golden and can build around him. Get the same great hero pack 5 and you didn't go those colors? Gg son, gg.
[/list]
Monetization isn't really an issue for me, just don't like the game. I will say, if your inclined to try it because of reviews that are like "Paid $20.00, got $22.00 worth of cards!," don't be fooled. Expected value is very low. I only got like $4.00 worth of cards. Essentially unlicensed gambling, and those who post favorably about it just happened to win.
Artifact just isn't rewarding. Yes, you can play infinite free drafts, but why would you? You earn nothing for playing the game and are forced to pay to expand your collection. 200 hours from now I'll be in the exact same limited position as I am to begin with. I will be returning to Hearthstone, deeply regretting my purchase.
This would be fun if I could finish a game without having a "lost connection to game server" error. I havn't finished one non bot match. Also you buy the game to then pay more for cards. Same old P2W rubbish that put me off Hearthstone.
It seems to be not so expansive. I mean, you need to spend money but not so much as others reviews said. 

As a Magic the gathering arena player i feel like Artifact missing something.
The impact of the random/lucky aspect of the game are limited and you can usa a moderate amount of tactic making your decision.
Unfortunately the game has not so much cards as needed to have a really deep tactics as it should.

It is an enjoyable title if you are confident with the Dota universe.  Otherwise you can find better options for a card game, yet.
I'm completely changing my review after the latest update. Now that the new rewards system has been implemented the game is a bit more enjoyable to play casually. The problem still remains that players who spend more money are still going to beat you probably 70% of the time. In the majority of my losing experiences it has been an overwhelming advantage in legendary cards that turn the tables at important points (time of triumph being the main offender as an insurmountable counter card). I definitely still get outplayed in some matches but the fact that there is still a major pay to win aspect is a bit depressing. Unless i feel like paying the extra money right off the bat to have a competittive deck i'm looking at dozens of hours grinding it out to be on more equal ground with players that had an extra $100-$200 to invest. 

The new update  was much needed but the game itself is not compelling at the current price point and the base playability is jut not fair to casual players. Might still play from time to time but this will not likely be a mainstay in my gaming lineup. I'm a bit dissapointed.
Artifact is a great game if you don't take into consideration the balancing, the economy and the lack of progression.
I love the idea of having 3 lanes to work with and the moba feel is great, but once you play for a couple hours you start to feel the bad stuff more.

Having no ranked mode is awful, but having ranked mode in this game's current state would be even more terrible, simply because Cheating Death, Kanna and Axe are abominations that should be removed from the game or nerfed into the ground.

Hearing Dota was the "most balanced moba" I expected this game to be similar to it, and yet this game is far from it, which is disappointing.

Having played this game for 88 hours by the time I'm writing this I have to say that the time I spend playing it was completely wasted if you don't take "fun" into account, because you don't get to see your MMR and you don't gain shit from winning regular games and you have to pay to play competitive, which is ridiculous by the way.

I'd say I had fun playing this game in the past couple days, but after the first week I started feeling frustrated. I do not recommend anyone to buy this game in it's current state. Valve doesn't give a shit about anything except money, if people keep buying nothing will change. This game gives players to insentive to keep going.

Thing I'd say need to change:
* Cards NEED to be balanced
* A contructed ranked mode has to be added
* Your MMR has to be displayed somewhere
* Winning 3 games on constructed should give players a fragment of a ticket. (with 3 fragments turning into a full ticket), 4 wins = 2 ticket fragments and 5 = a full ticket.

This might seem like asking for too much, but asking the people that PAID for this game to pay even more without giving anyone the chance of not having to spend more money on the game is ridiculous.

TLDR: Moba mechanics = cool; game = shit; buy = no.
The game setup is good and fun. all the refrences are cool and the voice lines are awesome. its simple to pickup but hard to master. 

The game is great, but the one issue that has caused me to stop playing is the incentive. There isnt any. after you open up your first 5 packs you get, and whatever packs you earn using the free tickets you start with, there is no way to earn further cards other than to purchase them. there are no quests or experiance counters. so once you open your origanal packs, you either stick with those cards the rest of your career, or throw money at the game.


Concept is very interesting and I enjoyed it (for a while), but pay-to-win is very much prominent and noticeable. While not too expensive, unless you don't mind spending money, don't expect too much as the game offers very little once you master the mechanics. Certain cards are overpowered and it's basically game over once they're played, with very little alternatives at the moment.
When I played for first time, it was intersting and exciting expirience.
Next games and I was still enjoying it.
But then, while still enjoying it, I turned the game off, thinking that I will play tommorow, and never turned it on again. 
And I came to realisation that you can enjoy it for while, but there is just no fun in this game.
A very big money grabber... spend money or  no fun ...

                                     15.4 hrs last two weeks / 15.4 hrs on record

Well after 15 hours it is comfirm a huge pay to win game ... just make this exercise build your deck go play gaist others and inspect the openet deck, see the prices of the cards you hare missing to have same deck... all best decks 25/50 euros of cards missing on mi side
Save your money... This game should be Free-To-Play. MTG Arena at least has free progression, this is Pay to Win and feels like a waste of money and time. Its about a 5/10 on the fun scale and there is much better ways to spend your time. Don't fall for those hyping this...look at the Twitch views to see that this is a dead game.
Pay2win pay2play

Want to refund the game after trying it and realizing it isn't for you? 
Did you open your free booster packs?

Too bad. You're stuck with it now. Better play it with your shitty free decks so you don't feel like you wasted your money.

MTGA is free and you can earn cards and packs just by playing.
Do not buy. I've tried multiple times to refund this. Despite explaining that i wanted to give this game an honest chance, perhaps it would improve over time, i've seen it happen with other purchases, they refused all refund requests because and i quote "We will not be granting a refund at this time. The date of the purchase exceeds 2 weeks (our refund policy maximum)."

Terrible game, worthless card packs and no improvements what so ever. Spend your money elsewhere.
If you buy you need to buy ingame near 1.8 euro / pack or t4 ticket for 4.5 euro (prob 2 ticket / draft) if youi play draft you have big chance to lose your free 5 packaged.. if you dont pay you cant play after you purchased this game. And 90% Pay to win
I was very excited for Artifact, as I like trading card games and Dota.  Unfortunately, Artifact is not very well made.   The card pool is too small and limited for strategy to be an important part of playing or building decks.   The heroes and cards are not well balanced, making the game feel more like a pay-to-win mobile app rather than a competitive strategy game.  There is no ladder, and to play in any remotely competitive mode you need to buy tickets.  

Hopefully Valve can fix these problems in the future.  Existing cards need to be re-balanced, the economy needs to be reworked, and the card pool needs to be enlarged substantially.  At this point I see no reason to play Artifact, as there are many vastly superior online trading card games available to play.
Just too annoying to play IMHO.

Good TCG elements, but the excessive animations, slow ai decisions, unbelievably annoying demon cherub things just tip it over the edge from playable to not.

If they removed all the fluff, it would be decent.  Oh, and turning the voice audio to zero does nothing, it still talks constantly while you're trying to play.
No way to earn cards. The whole idea of this game is to be a massive money generator via the community market. Some of the cards are £10 lol and in order to have a good deck you pretty much need those cards. As soon as you open your free packs you are not allowed to refund the game, and there is no way to earn cards for free.

They do have a free drafting game mode, but it's non-competitive. If you get a shit draft you just abandon the run and retry. It's pretty trashy.
[b]TL;DR:[/b] It's pay to play and pay to win. Even if you do like card games and are willing to pay much, you're still better off with a free to play alternative. It's quite underwhelming and slow. I lost interest after 2 games already.

Is this really the path you want to go Valve? 3 days after release "mixed" reviews and ~50k players peek per day. Team Fortress 2 is still "very positive" with ~60k players peek after 11 years. EDIT: Roughly 10k players after 1 month.

[h1]Neutral:[/h1]
o The red and blue imp (cute at beginning, annoying ever after)
o Slow gameplay
o Complexity and high learning curve
o Some effort was put into this game to keep it alive, but for me it's still bad

[h1]Bad:[/h1]
- Another game full of microtransactions by big developer, nobody asked for
- One game can last up to 30+ minutes (average Dota is ~35 min, so why play Dota Card game?)
- Tutorial is VERY basic
- A lot of RNG (as if drawing cards from a deck isn't random enough)
- Not much time to read unknown cards during games
- HUGE paywall: Getting new cards and play modes are locked behind CA$H.
- Progression system feels unrewarding
- Players take alternating turns after every action. Means you can only play ONE card/action and then wait for your opponent to play one, etc. Some like it, but I absolutely hate it. Gameplay becomes very slow due to this mechanic.
Fun and engaging game with interesting and novel takes on the TCG genre, which I would otherwise give a resounding thumbs up. However, it is ruined by the sheer lack of balance with regard to the Black Hero cards and their spell cards, e.g. Phantom Assassin, Sniper and Sorla Khan, they are quite frankly embarrasingly unbalanced at the moment.

The ability to deal such high amounts of burst damage with such small costs and the rapid acquisition of gold which can lead to nigh on infinite Item cards for Heroes, such as Horn of the Alpha, whose ability to summon a 14/14 Thunderhide Pack every 2 turns, in combination with such already overwhelming offensive power that is provided by Black cards, is simply ridiculous. It is infeasible to play any deck other than a red/black or pure black deck, as any hero you summon is immediately killed by either Coup de Grace or Assassinate, and your creeps are killed by Slay.

So unless you have £30-50 to spend as a minimum to either copy these decks, or have even a chance of getting cards good enough to attempt to stop them, Axe or Kanna etc, good luck with winning any ranked/unranked games whatsoever.
It's a shit! You have 5 tickets, fully randomed gameplay, no way to earn tickets / packs unless you have won some through expert plays. What the point? Gaben big piece of something trying to steal everything from people. Well played!
I was all excited when I saw the first game coming from Valve in years, then went "Oh, nevermind" when I realised it was a card game. I got this for free as Valve gave me all their past and future games when I pre-ordered a Steam Controller. An interesting take on a card game, with some pretty heavy monetisation. In it's simplest form, I'd describe the game as "a card game version of League of Legends". Instead of playing on one board, there are three lanes; they each have towers, you get 'creeps' every round, and you have to destroy their towers.  Creeps and hero placement are random, which is annoying - and I generally wasn't grabbed by the gameplay.
So far the game is all about luck and money. Very little skill actually involved at this point as all cards are sooo similiar. If you are lucky enough to get some top teir cards (costs money for packs) or buying cards outright, you will get be left behind in cases where you go against top teir DECKS (many already estimated over 100$ on marcket if you copy). The tutorial (there is not really one) sucks and you rely on reading the hover overs. There is no "friends" list, stats page, any way too communicate with your opponents. To be a competitive game, a social game, it feels very lonely. Getting "free" packs is nearly impossible as well, so you pretty much have to stick with what you get at the beggining or spend more money.

Compared to Hearthstone (which I hate to compare) the balancing and strategy is lacking. The teaching of cards and strategy and the glipse of hope for getting free cards/packs that Hearthstone has makes you look at your wallet with Artifact and ask, "Do I really want to invest more money on a new game?". There will always be balancing, and changing of strategies, and as such, more cards and demands. That means pay now at high cost, and risk being shafted later. I understand the "reason" for making you pay for packs is to make sure demand for cards retains value, but honestly, the cost is not justifiable per pack or even price of cards.
EDIT: Just found out that you cannot refund this game. Since buying the game gives you free cards, and they wont refund cards, you cannot refund the game. I never would have taken a chance on this game if I had known refunding was not an option.

If you like Hearthstone, you should give this game a try. Similar but slower, like playing three connected games of hearthstone at once.

The interface is kind of messy, and all the animations flying around the screen give me a headache. Being unable to see all the cards in play at once when there are too many units in the same lane is annoying. 

Every card game where you draw from a deck will have a heavy dose of random chance, but Artifact goes further. Creeps and heroes come into play in random positions, and attack in random directions if they don't have an enemy directly in front of them. Each game starts off with heroes and creeps already randomly distributed accross the three lanes. Lots of % chance to activate abilities. 

Lacks any unique identity and feels like a quick branded tie in to DOTA. Have you ever played DOTA and thought, I wish I could play this exact game but in TCG form? If you have, then this will be the game of your dreams.

If you enjoy DOTA and Hearthstone, and are looking for something that shares qualities of both. You might just love this game.

Me though? I don't like Hearthstone, I'm not a big fan of DOTA, and I find Artifact absolutely boring.
I wanted to love this game. I went from hater, because I didnt want it to hurt Magic the Gathering Arena which I spent quite a bit of money on($300) but then watching streams I got excited and hopefull for it and now here we are. It is fun. It's complex. I like games that are a challenege. The gameplay is fun. The game play is exciting. There is no point of playing though. Sure you can play phantom drafts for free. You can play casual for free but theres no point. Theres no reason to keep you playing. It really is a money sink. Its pay to play to pay. It feels really bad. There are so many good points about the game but theres a reason games have log in rewards and things to work towards cause it makes you feel like you are working towards something. Artifact doesnt have this. I want to play. I enjoy the game, but it just feels bad in 2018. I get that people are different and I see the people that say "just play to have fun, we dont need rewards" but it doesnt feel good. It doesnt make me want to spend more money. I paid 20 for this but I wouldnt drop anymore cash. I could but for what? Pay to play to pay. Theres no reason to. Valve give us a reason to play. A reason to spend money. Rethink rewards. Do something and your game will grow. Overall the game is fun. I like it, but reasons for playing it just feels bad compared to every other card game. GG fuck bois.
12.21 Thanks for the packs 
          BUT I WONT CHANGE MY REVIEW TO POSITIVE
          SINCE THIS IS SHIIIT GAME 
          LOL

-------------------------------------------------------------------
The best words I can say about this game is 
THIS IS A PIECE OF SHIT


TRASH GAME  GO TO THE HELL
Massive balancing issues. The idea of 3 lanes is interesting, but ultimately it is only down to RNG. If you have the better card ($$) you will win the game - that's it.
The gameplay is solid but the ridiculous monetization, lack of variety, and non-existent progression systems really ruin a promising idea. I would love to check back in on the game after some balance updates but absolutely will not unless they add in a method of aquiring cards without $$$.
frustratingly difficult, i started with trash tier cards, im bad at the game, and valve wont let me refund

the buy in is way too expensive if you want to play on a competitive level, but as long as you dont care about actually having decent cards you should be good to go
I've played differents card game such as Gwent, Hearthstone, and ES: Legends. Artifact is the worst of them all. I get bored so fast. The only good thing about this game is we can buy card in steam market, which means we do not rely on the pack rng.
This game is currently pay to win. The resources are new player are given are like a bringing a sharpened stick to a gun fight. The way to get more packs freely is to painstakingly scrap for a win here and there only to get a hand full of packs that have no real impact on the game play. Besides the lack of resources for new players the balancing doesn't exist and it is evident in the lack of heroes you say when you play constructed. The game would be more interesting if it wasn't so poorly executed. I recommend playing Dota 2 until this trainwreck gets fixed
If you don't have axe you lose all damn time to those who has it and theres no logic or fun in it. Simple you buy axe's you win game w.o a brain, if not then you delete game after 24h. fuck  you valv
It's a fun and very complex concept
Would not reccomend buying it now though, since it's pay 2 win. You pay for the game and then have to pay if you want any additional cards.

I'd return it, but I'm already over two hours of gameplay unfortunately. I hope they'll improve their game with a proper ladder and proper ways of obtaining cards ingame. 
Would have expected differently from Valve, but it seems like every big publisher can't help themselve and go for the same money making schemes like EA, Ubisoft and Activision.
Interesting game design marred by terribly greedy pricing structure, the tickets premium currency is required for all competitive game modes with no way to generate them, only maintain your current amount by having the best deck.
The cost to be able to play the game effectively goes well beyond the initial payment. It can be argued that this will change as the game ages, but it will happen in every new card edition. There needs to be more ways to get cards. 

If you are looking for a traditional TCG game, this is your game. Similar idea to Magic, Yugioh, etc. But if you are looking for a casual card game then this probably won't be it. Because it would just be to hard to remain remotely competative unless you put money into it.  With that being said, if you are looking for a traditional card game I would reccomend it. But for your average player who may only pay the initial 20$ and play every now and then It will not be fun or at the very least hold your attention.
The game was really great at launch and considerably well balanced. But everything else was a freaking disaster. It is so sad, since this was a great opportunity, but this just shows once again, that richard garfield should stay away as far as possible from online gaming. I am not mad, I am sad. I loved the game itself, but everything around it was just so abysmal it sucked the fun and motivation right out of it. And I am not complaining about real money purchases, I spent a lot of money and had a lot of fun with it.
Oh boi, here we go.
- game that has the most predatory payment model I have ever witnessed that can perhaps only be contested by some chinese mobile games
- buy to play game
- packs are only accesible by swiping your credit card - you will not get rewarded for actually playing the game
- all competitive modes are buy-in to play
- busted OP rare cards that you can only obtain by gambling with packs or buying them for like 30 euro each on steam market
- thousands of "chosen ones" have been playing the game for moths now and will abuse the fk of their head start by dominating competitive buy-in modes, so dont even dream of getting any legit results, let alone rewards

Game itself is actually complex and fun, but holy moly, its such money miliking fiesta that even EA would be ashamed to implement these business practices
Why? Just why? you lost pretty much all of the CIS Dota community with that monetization - they simply don't have the money. And they were your best chance for an active and stable playerbase, other than Chinese of course.
I just simply can't comprehend why Valve of all people will choose to smear probably the best card game in the market with this abomination of a monetization system. Yeah sure, if you have 200 bucks just lying around it is fine. But why the fuck does valve ignore their customers in poorer countries? A lot of people in CIS are living on about 500 bucks a month. For them paying that 200 bucks for all cards is a HUGE investment.
This game is great but I can't justify it. It is a damn disgrace for Valve and a huge letdown for all of Dota 2 fans in shithole countries. You were supposed to give as an escape from greedy assholes, not join them, Gaben!
Edit: Wow, never expected to edit a review to actually make it worse. This is ridiculous. Valve seems to have just abandoned the game and Gartfield and his team reportedly left the company. Still we get zero comments or explanations. Couldn't imagine this game could make me angrier, but it did. What a joke. Now I really regretting not having spent that money on MTG: Arena - could've bought an entire set for the price of one deck I have here.
This game really does not deserve a long write-up. While I am sure valve will work to improve the experiance for along time, the fact is this game is 90% randomness and luck. you can play constructed which is pay to win plus luck or draft which is luck and even more luck. the amount of games that are decided because in 10 rounds a TP scroll never appears in your store or bad flops forever is pretty obscene. granted all card games are luck but this is more so than anything else and straight up unfun to play.
No way to get cards...impossible to get any cards by playing the game jusr 2$ packs that give you garbage with a very small card pool currently. Fail by vavle on this currently,Mighht be good in the future but i doubt it. They neew to tttake some exaplles frorm hearthstone and give ways to get packs by playing a decent amount of the game and getting good at it...
This game has the greediest businessplan out there. It might be decently fun to play, but the money you have to throw at this game is ridiculous.  There are no free cards or tickets. You pay for the game, only to realize, that you will have to keep paying for playing. It's like they saw EA and their battlefront trainwreck and went "I can do that, hold my beer"
I've gotta be honest here, I think the game is really fun, and I had high hopes for it.  However with that said, I honestly can not recommend it.  There is no feeling of progression.  There are no rankings, no ladder play, and no sense of competition.  If you are looking for a fun card game, that is tried and tested, and has good rank competive play, please do yourself a favor and check out Magic the Gathering Arena.  That game has a lot of things going in the right direction.  Arifact, just feels lack-luster and like a Steam/Valve money making attempt.  

(I didn't find MTGA until after I'd done my homework on this game.  I really want that online CCG competive enviroment and when this game let me down, Google pointed me to MTG Arena). :-)
PAY TO WIN game. Cant get a small shit for free, cant win a single shitty match without paying, and just a couple of bucks wont help you get your shit done. Need to spend shit lot of money to get good in this game.
This game is 95% pay to win, dont believe anything else, you only have 5 chances(tickets) to earn packs and the ticket back, after you lose the tickets you dont have any chance to even get 1 card. Dont believe that you can learn the game and win, the game has only few winning strategies, you cant win with anything and just pick the good cards, you must have a "combo".
Buying this game was the worst decision of my life, i thought that from the few good reviews that the game is good and you can do something, but I WAS SO WRONG.
DONT BUY THIS GAME, you CANT REFUND it, so better off to no even try it out.
Bought the base game.
Played for several hours
Realized Call to arms is a flop in terms of marketing, business practices, and features (No chat, progression, VR support)
Sold cards until I made up initial cost.($19.99)

Will be playing casual draft until Valve opens it's ears to community reception. (Probably will be playing casual draft indefinitely)

*EDIT 2. Thanks for the update. Hero chat wheel changes everything xD

*EDIT 3. Valve has no idea how to develop games anymore.
WARNING BEFORE BUYING THIS GAME!!! Artifact looks like a good game and is but the price is deceptive. You pay for the game and get 5 packs and then nothing you cannot in any way get another card. The only way to get more cards is to pay real money for them. This is the only CCG i have ever played where there is no way to get cards. Good game ruined by a greedy company if you dont want to pay a constant taxes to play save yourself the money.
Pay to play is fine if you can make some progress. You have to win 5 games without losing more than two which is bound to happen given the OP cards out there and RNG. I' ve spent too many tickets already and got nothing. Complete scam; although it is fun to play. Valves new money making machine. The base cards I have cant get me anywhere. Horrible for new players. No Clear MMR system. I get that its still beta maybe, but the players suffering now deserve a refund
You might possibly make your investment back selling rare cards on the market, but it's unlikely. Should be free2play given you have to buy cards, or at least have a demo.
Interesting mechanics and good card game. However £5 for one of the rare cards? No chance to even earn it? Have to buy it? Gross. Can't even have fun with a personal deck unless you pay them more money. Disgusting.
I enjoyed the tutorial. But the moment I got out. I did not recieve any of the items I was told I was going to recieve. Hope they fix that. But currently its feeling like i literally just threw my money out the window.
Valve delivered a high quality game as expected and the idea of making dota into a card game is fresh, but I cannot recommend the game. The game is totally unbalanced and there is too much RNG.

- Some cards are OP and some are completely useless.
- The heroes are always deployed on a random slot on the lane. With an red hero, for example, you want to face the enemy hero directly and as an blue hero, for example, you want to be as far away from the enemy hero as possible. The red heroes will destroy the blue heroes, for example, within 2 or even 1 turn. So you have to be lucky.
- The creeps are spawning on random lanes.
- The units are attacking randomly to the front or to the left or to the right. This produces situations that are very unfair. It can happen, that a unit is destroyed with 20 damage and has just 2 health, effectively protecting the tower, just because of RNG... who needs taunt, right? It can happen, that the enemy hero is attacking your hero, but you are attacking his tower, so you will lose your hero, giving him 5 gold and a free round (if you don't have another hero to play cards on the lane), leading to the enemy snowballing.
- The shop presents you random offers. For your equipment this is a minor issue, but it can happen, that you really need a TP to swap the lane with your hero. If you get no TP offered, this can just lose you the game.
CONTEXT:

Played M:tG, digital MtgO and Shadowverse. 

Barring its rough launch, Artifact is a thoroughly fun game. A self-confessed Timmy, my passion comes from building new funky decks or bashing heads in with the biggest Revtel Convoy I can come up with. 

UPDATE: Devs went back on the pillars of the game that I originally bought the game for, now giving out free packs, and adjusting values on cards originally bought for high prices on their marketplace. The blatant bait and switch was...sadly disgusting.

PROS:

Unique blend of traditional CCG (cards/mana/deck synergy) and DOTA (creeps/lanes/gold)
Very tactical/mathematical play, with overarching strategy/logic.
Cheapest digital CCG on the market over time.

CONS:

Devs went back on the pillars of the game that I originally bought the game for.
Pay upfront to improve your card pool, or get lucky with the free/earned packs.
Volatile metagame. With Patch 1.2, cards can be nerfed/buffed without warning even though bought with real money, depending on pressure from the vocal internet.
PROS:

What the game does succeed to present, it presents well.
The mechanical aspect is superb. It's an amalgam of the familiar tabletop gameplay and some new elements which greatly expands the play-space.
Games are usually close, there are lots of ways of playing from behind to turn tables around.
The card artwork is good. Lots of big names are on the artist list, and it's pretty consistent in all its variability.
The sound palette is stunning. Every music track is vibrant, distinct and fits the board situation well.
The lore depth is enormous: Artifact draws from the Dota 2 universe and expands on it, this finds reflection in the sound design: cards interact with other cards present and react to the situation on board. Every card has its voice-acted description and all the characters involved are cross-referenced in one way or another.

CONS: 

Almost everything above is made corrupt in one way or the other.
Aftifact announcement, post-announce management, presentation and beta were horrendous. Several key features promised way before beta are still missing. Valve is as silent as ever.
Monetisation model is questionable. You pay a hefty sum upfront, then you pay to complete your desired deck, there is no way to gain cards other than winning the gauntlet or buying them from the Steam Marketplace.
The music is fantastic, yet there are only around five tracks. Those get old very fast, considering the average match goes for at least 20 minutes.
There is no way to exchange cards with your friends (or share a pool of cards when you play tournament), you can't even play 1 on 1 in the same way you can play versus a bot. You can't transfer or share any value in any other way than the Marketplace.
Boring, games are too long, the rng for creeps and hero placement is unbearable, dont like the 3 lanes and farewell to my 200CND$. WTF are these valves devs smoking when they can just make a meme game happen instead of this boring crap.
I tried really hard to love this game, but it kind of sucks. A lot of really cool ideas that are poorly executed. 

RNG makes the game almost completely non-tactical. Yeah, it can be interesting and fun and I loe the fact that the RNG element makes it feel like a moba insofar as parts of the game feel out of your control, but that gimmick fades pretty quickly when a really tense game is shattered by the arrows falling in the wrong places. 

The power of the cards is all over the place, many of which are nonsensically overpowered. 

The initative system is fun at times, but, predictibly, it can turn into a disaster pretty quickly if you have something like Tidehunter in your deck. 

The cost of the game, too, if nonsense. It isn't worth the box price at all, not to mention the cost of packs. They try to butter you up by saying you can sell cards on the market, but, because a handful of cards are so much more powerful than anything else, there are only a few cards that are even worth selling, and, IDK about you guys, but I never get them. 

It just feels like a cash grab. I don't know why I would choose this game over MTGA or Hearrthstone-- even with a tier 1 draft deck, I never feel like I have enough control over the situation to actually enjoy the tactical aspect of TCGs. 


At first I thought this game needed work, now I just think it is a bad game. 

Newly released game that shares heroes with one of the most popular games Dota 2 currently has less players than:
Cities Skylines
Age of Empires II: HD Edition
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online
Brawlhalla
DayZ (HAHAHA)
Don't Starve Together
Counter-Strike (THE ORIGINAL COUNTER STRIKE MADE 20 YEARS AGO)
Divinity: Original Sin 2

Need I go on?
From the Forum:

Release, Patch, Cards, Market, Transactions
I bought the game at release, edition 1.0. I was happy with the game. Today I looked for some cards, I've been purchasing cards, and found some at my preferred price point. 

I couln't buy them though. Patch 1.2 meant that card changes, despite a marketplace to obtain cards, is the horizon. Why buy cards if one expects prices to go down even farther from altering the commodity?

What I would really like to hear from Valve is: We had to alter cards for balance, given a market, we will not do it again. We will be crediting users affected as much as we can since we profited off their transactions. We will not be changing any more cards in the future, but we will consider play bans, mode bans and the like. We are interested in the success of this game for everyone.

Short of a statement like that, I just can't find a reason to collect any more cards."

Disappointing. Changes appear to be sheer confusion and chaos.

Game at release and  patch 1.1  was great. Patch 1.2 changed the game package, some cards, and thus game play. 

(As of writing) You can buy a lot of cards for five cents a piece right now. That's over 66% off the price of buying in a pack. As some cards have changed, obtaining by either method seems in question.

I will recommend again if Valve shows confidence in their product by ignoring critics who cite player numbers, and, if Valve shows a greater focus on game play.
PAY TO PLAY at its finest.
they even get payed for community market! :'D
i think in the whole game there is no such a thing then anything free.
not even RANKED!!!!
for everything you have to pay real money. they didnt even try to do an ingame currency...

sad. its a nice game but it cant be that its only purpose is to feed tons of money in valves wide open mouth...
this game is good and i like it

The worst thing of this game is no reward without money contents

Hearthstone and Gwent are need money to buy card pack but that doesnt mean cant play without money

those game have reward daily or win each times

but this valve game is has nothing without REAL money 




I don't write many reviews, but I felt I had to with this one. It is justa pay to win game, there are 1 maybe 2 deck combinations that essentially garuntee a win. However, they are made using so many rare cards you would need to spend around £60 on top of the game price. It means that every time you play vs constucted decks you will come across the same deck probably 2/3 of the time (and i really mean the exact same deck). 

The other reason I wouldn't recommmend this game is the amount of unnecessary randomness in what is essentially a game of chess. For most builds where you heros land and who they chose to attack will decide whether or not you win. You have almost zero control over this. 

There are lots of really good aspects of this game that have been ruined by poor design choices and outright greed from Valve. There are better card games out there don't waste your money on this one.
You think that's the strongest card you ever get in this game ? Nope , the strongest card is sitting right in your wallet. Welcome to Credit Card Game
RNG destroys the game.  If you like coin flipping your way to a win or loss this is the game for you.  If you're not retarded and enjoy strategy, mechanics, and skill based outcomes don't bother...fml...trust me I tried to enjoy it.   It's bad.
It's a really good game, however outside of casual draft and player made gauntlet drafts everything relating to the monetization is just too much of a negative.

Beyond the apt comparison of card packs with loot boxes, the expert game modes also amount to what is essentially gambling. Buying single cards doesn’t really get away from this as at some point in this monetization scheme unregulated gambling has to take place, which i’m not comfortable with.

So yeah, it’s a good video game that takes a back seat to its ‘economic model’ of MTX as gambling which is a shame.


It's boring.

Matches takes too long. Like coooome ooon. (Played 6 hours, had like 9 matches) 

Reward for long matches are none. You get none, unless is weekly or level reward.
In sense you have to spend money on new cards.

It is not worth.

I'll try get a refund

Cant recommend this game right now.  Absolutely no type of progression or reward without paying extra money.  No weekly or daily quests, no ranked, no "good job, here's a pat on the back", nothing!
Artifact IS BEST because:
- most chalenging gameplay, the most interesting card game i've ever played. It covers all card game functionality, like Civilization ant other turn-based strategies cover their table top prototypes.
- market mechanism is AWESOME. This is how it shoul be done, some improvements there, a touch of UIX somewhere else ...

Artifact IS WORST OF ITS KIND, because:
- monetization model is outrageous, Valve is soooo greeeedyyy ...
- drop system, and adverse variance chance are WAY out of ordinary. I saw a guy, who opened pack and two (!) Axes, and three (Khallas). In my case - i received ALL THE SAME cards. Like, the same rare card IN EVERY BOOSTER. I bought 15 of them ALREADY! And i'm not willing to pay anymore.
- there is no any kind of incentive to play this game: there is level-up Dota 2-like style progress, NO (!) statistics, NO rankings/ratings, NO ladder. There is no quests, no events - and there is no adequate way to win gauntlet matches BECAUSE of ...
- AXE! When you red-green (Axe+Drow), or red-blue (Axe+Khala+Meepo) - well, you're out! And there is NO OTHER GUYS in Gauntlet mode. And if you have this type of deck - the only things left behind victory IS A CHANCE!

At this point, i'm not quite sure - i don't even quite realize. Is it that GOOD, that something MUST TO BE MADE it little worse.

Why i bought booster, but NOT the axe? Answer is QUITE SIMPLE - or Axe will be nerfed, as it 110% imbalanced. Or they will tune drop rate, and Axes card cost will DROP significantly.

I'm NOT RECOMENDING this game at this current production stage. Because pain of suffering from AXE + MEEPO + KHALA/PHALAX is bloody headache!
I love Dota and I love ccgs both digital and on cardboard. The game has some RNG but the mechanics are unique enough to overlook that RNG. Biggest problem is that there is no way whatsoever to earn free cards or currency. It is a strickly Pay to play/win game. While I dont mind playing games where you can purchase cards and I fully expect that from any game to not offer a path for players to earn cards for free really shuts down the player base and stops many people from wanting or being able to play a game that they would otherwise fully support.
Card is so unbalance at all !!
i think you market way in this game is wrong just buy a pack to get a card Oh come on! even if i play free i wouldn't happy with this game totally cheating for a person buy this artifact game  when you buy this game YES!! you will get free 10 pack of cards but there is no garanteed that you will get a good card THIS IS TRASH !! This is not Pay to play But it is Pay to play AND Pay to WIN!!
--------------

EDIT:
Some of these insane card designs have been addressed and received nerfs, which definitely improved the game. However, now I must say that there's not enough content/cards to make you want to play it for longer than a week, so it's still not an amazing purchase. If they keep up with nerfing stupid ideas and introduce at least 3 expansions a year, the game should become fun and varied enough in about a year from now.

--------------

In all honesty, there's some insanely stupidly designed cards in this game. The whole game revolves around building up your hero cards through the match, so that they can survive combat, but then you have stupid cards that delete your hero. So to make up for that, they created an optional mechanic where you can give your units 50% chance of surviving deadly damage - hardcore insane RNG. There's also a card that gives permanent invulnerability to a Hero, which is insane, because the counter to this card is not common, not everyone will run the few cards that exist that can cancel or bypass it. This game seems cool when you're playing meta decks against other meta decks, and an inexplicably stupid clown show of garbage game design when you're doing anything out of the ordinary. Not even Hearthstone makes me this mad.

I have to reneg on the RNG, though. You'd think RNG is usually fun in a card game? Not this one. Games are often decided on what direction your units decide to attack, if you get your heroes' signature cards in time or not, if you win a coinflip on the 50% death effect, if you get critical utility items in the secret shop, etc. etc.

A recurring problem I have is needing to remove a hero from one lane and putting them into another, but never getting any Teleport Scrolls or Blink Daggers in the shopping phases. I've lost track of the number of games I've lost where I had spent 3-5 turns without any redeployment items appearing in the shop. Sure, from a tryhard perspective, I shouldn't have had my hero get uselessly stuck in an empty lane, but uhhh excuse me for wanting to have fun as a casual player I guess.

Overall:
High learning curve but the game is ruined by awful amounts of RNG and a bunch of hyper-strong cards which seem fair in the developer's vision of the meta matches. Cheaper than Hearthstone, though. Will always be.
After looking forward to this game for quite some time all i can say is im disappointed.
It's not worth the money, buying a full set should be about 300$. The games are awfully slow paced. 
I cant see this game being anything other than a way to collect cash. Whats next Valve, mobile games? Come on...
Even thou it is Valve, that doesn't mean the game is perfect. The game itself is fun and making it that you have to manage three seperate battlefields is cool, but for love of god, why would you put microtransactions into already paid game. Also why the hell can't we get more packs without paying real money? I guess that you can earn soma by selling your cards on Steam community store, but still that doesn't solve the problem. Either you pay for more cards and can actually be part of the competitive community, or stuck with the only starting cards you got from 10 packs you got in the begining or pre-maid decks, which will became boring after some time. So for now, after the release I can't really recommend it.
P.S.: Valve, are you kidding me? After taking thous 10 packs I can't normally refound the game? What is this blasphemy?
Card art looks like it is still stuck in beta. The game itself is still in beta by the sheer amount of missing features. No reason to pay 20 bucks for a game where you have to continue to pay if you want to reap any benefits. Constructed is a joke with a VERY small number of decks being viable, and this wont change any time soon (Valve said they were going to do everything they can to not adjust card values). Honestly anyone is better off staying away from this game and supporting other developers who aren't as greedy. I guess Valve is lucky a bunch of other big developers had massive flops this year and overshadowed this paltry game.
Extremely bland and uninspired base set and the game is very bare-bones and feels dead.
The gameplay itself feels like solving a math equation, its just not fun. There is also an insane amount of RNG compared to other card games.
I don't think this game can be saved without a major overhaul of the core mechanics.
This is sadly a game with a TON of potential but ruined by one of the worst monetization schemes and a plethora of badly designed luck based mechanics. While the game is not neccessarily expensive compared to most TCGs, the issue falls in an awful approach to winning/earning products. You're basically forced to pay for boosters and singles to fill out a set/deck, as investing in one deck to hopefully win more cards is a grueling and awful climb even if you have a high win rate. On top of that, while the game does have some impressive depth, skill can only carry you so far with the absurd variance mechanics mucking up the result of any carefully crafted plan. 

As a competitive gamer with tournaments in mind, I urge you to avoid this game until the mechanics are reworked. Currently the game is more gambling than skilled play and I can't hold it's competitive value in high regard. For casual players, the pay2win aspect is brutal and you will be force to pay out for a deck to keep pace.
Besides the game wanting a lot of your money, apart from the buying price, it s also unbalanced and too much based on luck. You re up against red heroes, all ligned up vs your heroes in the start and you can surrender.
"Pros" will tell you, you just don t get the game.. maybe they re  right I don t know and I don t care. But following that insight, this is no fun for casual gamers. I suppose there are specific builds to counter that but you don t know what you re up against in expert play anyway so....
So unless you never want to get any kind of reward in terms of new cards... you can play friends for 1 week and get tired of your limited options for deck building and just drop it. Or pay ofc.
The game itself doesn't feel good. Fights feel passive since the creatures only attack automatically to their opposite, the impact when an unit hits a tower is way too soft. The idea that you can have endless creatures on board that can't be displayed so that you need to scroll horizontally through them is imho a very bad design decision. Overall the gameplay doesn't actually feel like playing a game, more like spectating and hitting a few buttons. In other card games there is way more punch and direkt fight between both sides.

And last but not least, the monetization is just bad. I think Artifact is the first big B2P game where you can only make progress with paying more real money. Dear Valve: Games are an entertainment media, not a business modell. If that's your goal, you're in the wrong business. Games are passion, created by developers with passion, played by people with passion. It's not about filling your pockets with as much money as possible.
If you hoped the game is free to play after initial cost, think again. Yes, you can play for free, but there is no reward, progression or accomplishment system in place to motivate you to play. If you want rewards / packs then you have to pay.

It is a shame because the game has potential, especially drafting, but it most likely will be wasted because usually $$$ matters more than the game itself.
This game outlines everything bad within the games industry.

- Trying to copy other game designs but only enough to not cause legal issues. Magic the Gathering much...
(games that do this make you buy the game coz it seem cool. But then you think its shit because the mechanic isnt really ther)

- Lack of cards
Seriously The Original 150 pokemon card game has more cards than this game.
One of the main reasons people play card games is the joy of getting new cards to use in cool decks.
But not this game.

- Pay then PAY even more.
So not only is there almost not careds, getting them is an extreme grind unless you par for them.
And since most people use the same OP card combos, you better expect to pay 50% of the original game price just for one of those cards.

- Restricted Meta.
So most card games have counters built into each different deck type to balance them.
However you are forced to either play a mixed deck of something with blue containing some strong heros & something to cast your blue cards. Or a pure deck and hope that you can cheeze it.

This is just not fun as you cant make the fun decks you want like you can in hearthstone.
I could go on & On, but you get the point.
Valve just wants more money.

Artifact is a really brilliantly designed card game and as a draft player i love it. The economy is the best of all virtual card games i played so far (hearthstone, mtga, mtgd, eternal, shadowverse, faeria and so on...). But even as it has the best economy of these virtual card games this economy is still profeteering. After the shitstorm they implemented free phantom draft which is fine but you still can't trade cards with friends and the only reason for this is that valve would get no money from it if you just trade the cards.
If you like draft buy it. If you like constructed you shouldn't.
pay to play? Why can't I earn cards in a game I payed for without paying more. hearthstone sucks ass but at least it's FREE and you can get every card by grinding
It seemed neat at first. The more I play though the more I realise I absolutely have to spend more money than the price of the game to actually play on an even playing field, EVEN against bots. Game mechanics also seemed nice at first with the game presenting a lot of stuff in an easy to see way, or showing things that other games hide or obscure. It made the 3 lane aspect less intimidating for sure. 

BUT, and this is a biiiiig but, RNG just determines so much of how a game goes that even with spending cash to have better cards, or more time building stronger decks, you can be RNGesus'd out of wins or into stupid wins for seemingly no reason. I didn't touch the other games in this genre once the RNG issues became apparent, and theirs were less severe than Artifacts, which makes me a bit sad to say.

One benefit of Valve vs the others though is they may actually make big changes to the core of the game, especially given that sales performance hasn't been what they'd hoped since release. I guess time will tell, but for now it's not high on my list for new games, or even in the CCG recommendations from me right now given the entry price and full card pool price.
There's a lot of stuff going on here, but for me, it's just not that fun.
I've only played a few hours and already feel like I'm just going through the motions every game.
Maybe the game gets better with more cards, but I'm not will to invest more money to find out.

Dissappointed/10
Worst game valve ever made, plus they won't let me refund it even when i did not open any of the packs/or use dota items.

For idiots: at that time i played less than 2 hours.

Plus I watched enough streams of the gameplay so don't judge based of my hours.

Avoid this game if you hate games that are almost based on RNG and P2W.
Fun to play, but the monetization and progression system (there isn't one) needs a ton of work. It just sucks hard that you have to pay up to get any more cards or to play any modes with prizes. They tried to go the Magic: the Gathering route, but it just doesn't feel right in a digital game. Go play Magic Arena instead if you feel the need to play something more complicated than Hearthstone.
My expectations for valve were high but this is a game that is designed to squeeze money out of you. The presentation is good but there is no way to play the game without spending more money other than casual phantom draft. That mode is good but the competative modes require a buy in and the game overall seems to just want you to gamble. Good Job valve, you managed to fuck it up.
Some refreshing ideas here, like playing 3 lanes at the same time, but that is about all you get. After couple of games it is obvious you need to burn a lot of cash to have any kind of playable deck or enjoy any of the slightly more interesting parts of the game (like drafting etc). Game also needs a lot of polishing as the whole experience feels currently really simplistic and to put it bluntly -- boring.

I recommend not to waste any money on this. At least yet. There is some potential here so better to take another look after half a year or so.
There is no free content and free tickets for next steps. U have to pay and pay more. Please add free tickets or card packs for a week at least. 

Game is funnier than hearthstone, his mechanics are unusual for a card game. but u cant continue to play that game for free.
Listen I really want to love this game, being an avid MTG player, ok more like obsessive MTG player (probably read every card ever existed) Im not above paying to play... its how card games work and have worked... period... I get that... I mean we have all run into foil nerds on MTGfriday right? But in Artifact i dread online interactions... unlike MTG i love playing physical card and MTGO I enjoy it very much, but Artifact doesnt quite do it for me.
I tried playing. Imagine the  problems with Magic's mana screw combined with Hearthstone's general RNG'ness. On top of that it's simply seems uninspired. It's probably the worst CCG I've played digital or paper.
I tried this game out, in terms of pricing its okay, but the game play and cards are awful. Red heroes are no doubt the best heroes in the game, and half the cards in the game are useless or are outclasses by higher cards, the only way to get more cards is to buy packs. Any decent card in this game is expensive on the market. The lane mechanics are nice, but you always end up abandoning one after the first round, and even with two lanes the games drags on way to long, and all the matches are filled with people do 1 of the 2 cheese strats in this game.
100% Pay to Play Platform. Clearly understand this by playing only 2 hours.
YOU CAN'T EVEN PLAY EXPERT MODE(FOR PRIZES) IF YOU DONT HAVE A TICKET'S
SO WHY YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME? FOR WHAT? Free matchmaking? For WHAT? WHAT THE POINT if you can't earn CARD PACK's
Don't understand this. Also  This game is SO ANGRY for newbies
VALVE. MAKE. SOME. DAILY. FREE. QUESTIONS. FOR EARNING TICKETS WITHOUT DONATION.
Don't buy and play this game untill we will get this.

You need skills to play this game. Sure. But it's also Pay-to-pay-to-win. I sold my dog for money to buy Artifact. Now I regret doing that. Kiki, I miss you! :'(
I enjoyed Hearthstone and I enjoy Dota 2.  Mix those two and it should be a pretty fun game for me right?  Unfortunately no, I was bored out of my mind just playing the 2 matches for the tutorial.  

The other unfortunate thing was during the tutorial, you open packs or something.  Once you do that, you lose the right for a refund, despite only have less than 1 hour played on it.  Thanks Steam.
The mechanics are like a simplified version of Hearthstone. The flow is like playing three hands, in serial, from three separate games. The UI is dota 2.

There is nothing nice I can say about this game.

This should have been a 3v3 game.
you have to put in constant money to actualy play prize play...
even if you win 70% of the games you still lose money .completly stupid!.
last update dident save nothing playerbase keeps shrinking.
you allready have to wait 5 minutes to get a match.
valve go free to play or you lose your last 4000 players.
even the game itself feels kinda bad theres too much RNG
where creep goes where heros goes and how they match up.
also these stupid arrows who hit who all RNG.
and then some stupid cards like anhilation for 5 mana you clear the board LMAO thats completly broken and evrybody use it.
im prety sure this game will die.
Not only is it horribly pay-to-win, but it's pay-to-play if you want to do any sort of serious game mode that anyone takes seriously. Certain heroes and cards are extremely better than others, so many heroes are so bad for some reason, it doesn't feel play tested at all, and if you don't get the great cards from your 10 packs, (you won't), you better cough up some $$$ to have a chance of winning. And nope, there is no way to earn cards in the game for free.
game crashes despite the fact that It can run dota without crashing. (granted, I have to use low settings) I'll update this review once the game crashes less often.

for context, the window will go away, but it's not closed.

update: I could not get a refund due to me opening artifact booster packs, so be warned before buying this game with a low end PC.

Update 2: The Artifact team is really trying to make this game a hit with a free to play and mobile push in the works. So you may want to wait for it to go Free to Play unless you're Artifact will prevail and want to support the game before it goes F2P.

-Please show respectful to the Artifact team.
Only buy if you're heavily into card games. It's full of unfun concepts, but it's still quite fresh and has time to improve, and I hope I can come back to this review and change it. It has some great ideas; the three lane mechanic is interesting, as are the respawning heroes, but it's definitely having what I'd call teething trouble in terms of card balance.
For now, given both the upfront cost and then additional cost required to build a competitive deck, I can't recommend this to the majority of players.
UPDATE 1: I geniunely do not recommend this game for ANYONE who wants to play constructed unless you want to sink in a butt ton of money in this game. There is literally only one deck that works atm and it's just terrible to play against with the lack of counters now that Green/Red got nerfed. I would caution yourself.

That being said, Artifact is a great game if you like card drafting! However, Artifact is not something you want to try unless you want to subject yourself to one mode, meaning to me Artifact is still incomplete.
Here's the pros and cons.

Pros
- Unique gameplay and great if you love long games.
- Familar card design and very beautful to look at.
- FREE DRAFT MODE ARE YOU SERIOUS???? THIS IS AMAZING
- Free decks to test out if you wanna feel spicy!

Cons
- Terrible meta atm with very little counterplay. Variety is lacking.
- This is probably one of the biggest money sinks atm.
- Half-baked progression system and lack of good social features.
- Terrible optimazation, it just uses so much to run.
- This will bore you out unless you have friends.

Artifact is geniunely awesome, but its held back by balance issues and also a servere lack of issues. This is not a complete game and it is a terrible state.
Game is incredibly slow and tedious. In addition it crashed three times in two hours.

Asked for a refund and was denied due to me opening cards won after completing tutorial.
I'm an older guy who doesn't care about paying for good games (and keep paying) so take this with a grain of salt.
1/2 the cards in this game are unplayable in draft decks.  It's insane to me that I can open a 2nd pack and fine 1 playable card out of 15 cards?  Seriously, 1/2 these cards are trash and to open a pack that has 3 of "Modify your oppenents armopr by x where is x is their armor" sucks.  Unplayable card in 99% of decks so why is it here?
Fix this crap.  Hearthstone draft gives you THREE cards and it's rare you can't find a decent deck card out of THREE.
Good game but this isn't MTG-get rid of the trash filler cards...considering 50% are trash/filler.


I really like this game but i can't recomend it. There is no reliable way to earn more cards like there is in hearthstone or gwent. To earn any type of reward you need to pay for a ticket and then win at least 4 games before losing 2. If your just starting out you need to fork over money to get better cards or else you wont win. This game is fun, REALLY REALLY FUN. but unless your willing to pay out the ass for more cards then give this one a pass.
Artifact tries to be a card game that is different from all the other games and at the same time tries to incorporate as many mechanics from DotA 2 as possible. This game is closer to a real TGC than most if not all the other TGC's out there by simply not allowing free packs to be earned and instead forcing you to spend essentialy more money to become or stay competative. This, coupled with the fact that all sales and trades run through the community marketplace mean that valve not only earns on you buying the booster, but also on you trading cards contained in said booster to others.

Overall the mechanics didn't feel like fun to me and made things more complicated than they should be by splitting the board into 3 boards you have to keep track of simultanously. 

Also, the return policy practices are shady as hell. You get the game with 10 free boosters but the fine print and cancel button are so minisculely small, that most people as seen on reddit and NeoGAF (myself included) didn't see that you can 1) skip redeeming the 10 free boosters you get and 2) can play draft without said boosters, so they naturarely open them only to find out that with doing so, made yourself unable to refund this game whatsoever. 

If you like a gard came that is a competitor to this one, I honestly advise to stick with your game instead of investing into this. With the way it is now, only a inimaginable small playerbase will stick to this game as everything is in some way tied to microtransactions or other ways of monetarization. Want to participate in a tournament? Better buy tickets. Want to stay up to date with cards or even relevant in the game? Buy more boosters and hope for good cards!
Frustrating and feels like you have no control sometimes. One moment you have lethal lined up, the next your opponent has lethal on you. Nothing you can do, there's no counterspell or counterplay to 'instant' cards.
Artifact is one of the strangest phenomens I have encountered during these last years of gaming.

It got bashed a lot, mainly due to the marketing idea of adding value to single cards and making them a legitimate source of trade. There was also a lot of hate going on because the game mechanics were "too random" for some.
They fixed a lot about the first issue, adding free packs (allthough very limited) and being a little less forceful about making people buy ingame ressources. They also added a very nice idea for a chat-system where you speak "through" your cards, which I found to be really creative and fun.
Considering the second "issue" about the randomness though: I completly have to disagree. The randomness is part of the Game Design, which was, from my point of view, absolutly awesome from the beginning. The games were exciting and it was very enjoyable to have some really genuine gamedesign for a trading card game, where the "usual behaviour" from other trading card games just isn't guaranteed to work. It is a game about weighting on which lane to shift your efforts and being able to deal with a certain amount of randomness and adjusting your tactics to it. I really got full respect for the game as it was during the launch, allthough I think mostly the marketing mechanisms and lack of unlockable packs killed it for many who are used of being fed sugar from those people trying to sell them something ...

You might wonder why I am still giving this game a negative review then. Well, it's mostly because of the direction of the latest patches. For some reason they seem to have decided it would help the game to make it faster.
Well, I can certainly see which target group this decision tries to appeal ... and I think they throw away the inherent strengths of the game with it and rather scare away those people who were happy with the initial game by doing so. Before the latest patches one match did take a while, yes, but it was some interesting and exciting time where you knew it would take a while and where you always had to be careful of any decision shifting the tides of chance against you on some lane.
But after those newest patches you are strongly stressed by short turn timers while they messed up the animations to compensate for it. Where the game previously feld wholesome and interesting ... in a relaxing yet exciting way ... those last patches mostly help it lose its own identity.
And yes, thats why ~now~ I too would not recommend it anymore, at least in the current state. I hoped for them to make some good changes and were always curious about how this game evolves, and now it just seems to be a shizophrenic mess of an initialy deep game design as core and some rushed makeup, made for an impatient target audience, on top of it, which really betrays its previous strengths and is bitter to look at.
I have been a huge Valve fan for years, and like to think I still am, but this game has left a real sour taste in my mouth.

Like everybody says, the game itself is great, brilliantly designed (like every Valve game) with endless possibilities for high-level play, much like Dota 2. They have marketed this game to fans of Dota 2, announcing it at last years International, but have gone for the total opposite monetisation model.
You pay for the game, you pay for the content, and there are paid modes with no way of entering without paying more still. There is also no direct card trading, only selling and buying on the market, where the GabeTax™ can slowly whittle away any extra cash you may put in.

There is no progression system whatsoever. No stats, no ladder, no cosmetics to earn (although you can be sure when cosmetics come to the game they will be far from free...), no levelling, and no incentive to keep playing at all.

Valve these days seem to be only interested in making games that print massive amounts of continued money, and seeing if they can get away with providing nothing else to players but more ways to spend more money on more random rewards. TF2, CS:GO, Dota 2 and now Artifact are the only games Valve are visibily working on, and they are ALL fueled by some form gambling. To me, it seems clear where Valve's interests truly are. I have never seen a company fall so out of touch with its own audience as Valve. They only see the money now, they don't hear you.

Now I'm certain Valve will improve the game, correct some issues and make it much more enjoyable, but they could have done all of this BEFORE and released a complete and satisfying game for ALL players on release, not just the ones okay with spending more money. Valve have made many stellar games and this is their first "full" new game in over 5 years, they should be held to a higher standard than most, and they've failed to even reach par.

If you're okay with enjoying the game just for itself without any real progression other than owning (see: buying) more cards, go ahead, but I cannot recommend this game in it's current state, and this release should now ALWAYS be held over Valve's head. Shame.
Brocken cards and broken decks... I really wanted to invest in this game... i started playing at Febuary and after ~60 days i gave up... the gameplay isnt smooth and it needs at least 20% of its cards fixed and 50% of the gameplay mechanics revisioned... Dont buy
Everybody seems concerned with having to buy the cards- like this is the first trading card game to require you to do something like that (although a 'trade with friends' option would be welcome).

My issue is with the unfun and uneeded RNG beyond what card games usually offer.  Random melee creep distribution sucks and limits the strategic element.  It's also not a great feeling when you deploy your hero to a lane only for it to be smashed to bits because you lost a ~33% chance for it to be put in front of an ursa. I'm sure that sometimes the stars align and you do put your hero/minions into the lane and they go where you want and it feels good...

and then they attack in a random direction and you lose the lane because of it.
Recommended for: People who don't want to collect cards without grinding and prefer P2W, Whales, idiots who say "This game is cheaper then F2P even though I paid $20 for the game and have to pay an extra $1 to compete in competitive games which if I fail to get 3 wins then I can kiss my $1 good bye" OR people who say "Grinding will kill the game as I like paying for cards so that I can actually get the cons of a PHYSICAL card  game without the benefits of a DIGITAL card game."

Not recommended for: Basically anyone with half a brain who realise they can get better value out of their money in other card games

TL;DR First time I am actually disappointed by valve.
Beyond the terrible monetization of this game the game is also incredibly unbalanced, being turn based and unable to react to what your opponent does if they have initiative makes instant kill cards like Coup de grace so powerful that it can lock you out of a lane, cards like blink dagger (which has no mana cost to cast or acticate making it hard to play around) give an overwhelming advantage, being able to freely move your heroes around with no downside while your opponets heroes are all stuck in their original lanes can make games literally unwinable.

TLDR  * Bad monetization.
           * Powerfull cards have No downside and often becomes a battle of who plays them first wins.
           * Items are  too powerful for having no mana cost giving them no downside for how strong of an effect they bring.
Card balacning... game breaking for me, no longer recommend.



This is actually better than what I thought it would be and kind of glad I pulled the trigger on it.  I'm not sure why ppl are bitching about the price... the game is free you are literally just paying for packs of cards which are reasonably priced.  The secondary market OMG it's dirt freaking cheap to the point it almost invalidates my only wishlist items which would be "starter decks" like MTG had that would give you a good swag of cards or a booster box that contains x number of packs for a slight discount and a couple guarantees.   Mechanics can have a lot of uncontrolled RNG play which can be slightly annoying.  I have expireneced some weird connection issues, not sure if game or other player.  The DOTA theme fades away pretty quickly if you aren't into it and requires no real knowledge of that game.  It needs some polish and tweaks but I'll probably keep playing it and expanding my collection.
Such a sad, pathetic Pay2Win monetization model. 100% lost my faith in Valve.

A shame too, considering the game is actually wonderful minus the fact that you literally cannot earn ANYTHING in-game without paying real money. No Valve, this isn't the same as a physical TCG. Don't pull that "card" on me.

It must feel pretty great reviewing refund requests for your own game. You've gotten my 20 bucks, but you won't get another cent out of me for this crap chute model of a game.
Don't buy unless you want to pay to get better. Packs are buy only, though you can level up to get more. Currently though, 2/10/19, the game sucks more than normal because everyone is playing the broken deck. Play black and win.
You pay you win. No ingame currency , no free cards , nothing to keep you playing or some way of progress. Definitely not satisfied with this game. Do not recommend this better play hearthstone or some kind of other card game.
This game is utter trash.  The RNG mechanics are anti-fun.  Every week or so I load up to see if I was wrong and leave angry because winning or losing ends on several RNG mechanics which as I said are anti-fun.  Do not buy this game.  The people saying they like it are just in denial.  Its utter trash.  Valve should be ashamed and offer massive refunds.
In other games you can boost your 'slow' progression with microtransactions. It sounds okay since we all have jobs now, right?

Well, Valve completely removed progression system.

You will find an entire well-designed tab to buy/sell cards since it's the only way to acquire your first deck. This seems cool to some players, but to me it's quite scary as it shows the main purpose of the game - focus on the cash flow inside the game, not the game itself.

I mean, in my second normal game with a default deck I met a player with full S Tier deck including Axe, Drow Ranger, Kanna, Lich, Legion Commander. As a casual player, I didn't have any plans on buying cards. Unfortunately or not, this is an attitude of most players in the community.

People say it's nice to get (the exact word is BUY not GET) all the cards you want from the start like the player above with a top tier deck, but ain't progression and building your deck step-by-step is a fun part of the process? Owning new players can be quite fun, but I bet it won't last long.

P.S. By the time you actually realize this, you won't be able to get a refund from Steam Support as you probably unpacked your starting items & spent in-game more than 2 hours.

As I see it, the product is focused entirely on people who come into the game with a side cash ready to invest, not just play and enjoy the game. With such position, Valve probably knew they won't met the expectations of most casuals, so they prepared an ignorant refund policy to make you lose the ability to get a refund after unpacking.

Eventually, you may still enjoy the game itself, but a lot of things could be done in a more polite and user-oriented matter since it's 2018 if i'm not mistaken.
Pay to play game. The worst and most talked about part of it is how much money it demanded on release, now the card prices have fallen because people quit playing/buying cards. The gameplay itself is quite bad imo, almost every stage of battle is determined randomly, from hero and creep positioning to items in the shop. Very little control over your deck, it basically comes down to managing  random factors which undermines the strategy of your own deck. Has a very low population considering its a Valve game, practically dead.
The only game i ever regretted buying on Steam.
Great game, delivers on all aspects for me. Ignore the hate from the mob that was expecting HS 2.0, it is nothing like it.
And yes there is plenty of room for casual play, although game is oriented towards competative skill based(you can run draft tournies with your friends, play with preconstrucred decks or spend about $20 extra to buy all the commons and uncomons and build your own decks to play with).

I am choosing "don't recommend" for a single reason that game requers Vulkan API and you can not run it in OpenGL, which is a real inconvinience for MacOS and Linux users, as soon as it's sorted game will have my 100% approval.
Tedious and sluggish, even if you win you feel no joy.
Constructed mode it’s a bad joke, there are a few OP cards and few OP items and rest only trash.
The RNG kills whatever pleasure left, from heroes deploy to items in shop, it really wins or lose the game for you.

I have been an avid hearthstone player previously. To give you an idea, i have about 2500 wins on Hearthstone, which is likely close to 5k games played, if my winrate is close to 50%. So its safe to say that I like card games, and I'm willing to spend quite a large amount of time in card games i enjoy. I've put 6 hours into Artifact, and honestly, i really have no desire to play it anymore. When i started playing Hearthstone, it was intriguing, fun, and i was hooked by the depth of strategy and the thrill of beating my opponent. In Artifact, even my wins feel boring, and the losses seem to just drag on for forever. Every time i finish a game, i immediately get off to do something else. There is simply not another game I've encountered where I have been so bored to tears in such a short time. There is depth to the strategy, but it all just feels so underwhelming, tedius, and unsatisfying, even when you win. I cannot recommend anyone pay money for this game.
Pre-ordered the game, heard that it was pay2neverprogress. I think valve choosing to make a digital card game the same upkeep costs of a normal TCG is a bad idea.

EA Games once made a RTS 3d card game called battleforge, which was f2p but with the same idea as artifact; cards would only be obtainable by paid boosters, with no way out of the starter decks. Artifact is poised to be in the same position.

I'm fortunate in that out of my early 10 boosters, I got enough rares that were worth the price of the game. But its unlikely I'll ever return - mechanically, the game can be great, but it'll be a game only for the dedicated TCG player.

Guess I should be checking the box that I received the product for free?
You buy a card from the market and the next day Valve nerf's it. Feels amazingly bad. They should just ban the card from certain formats instead of completely ruining the card and nuking it. It does not feel good at all.
I really spent some time on this to be 100% sure I wouldn't miss anything.

Since a lot of people already listed all the cons of the game, here is a list of what I found great or original on it :

- The board is divided in 3. This is original. But this isn't great. At all.
I've played a couple different CCGs and after playing Artifact for awhile I feel like it's not a bad game... but it's not a good one either.  

The fact that it emulates dota and has three different boards/lanes to fight over does not make this game feel any different than Hearthstone, or any of the other dozen CCGs out there, it just feels like a gimmic meant to slow the game down.This may be partially due to the fact that every board change is acompanied by an unessisary animation done by the two helper imps... 

One of the major mechanics is that you choose 5 heroes, in 4 colors depending on the playstyle. Blue = Magic, black = removal, red = aggro, green = defensive. When a hero dies it automatically gets resurrected a turn later. Not only is that color association overdone, it feels completely un-nessisary, but that's not the worst part of the hero system. In order to cast ANYTHING in a lane you need to have a hero with a matching color there; This is one of the clunkiest, worst feeling mechanics I've experienced in a CCG, it means that if your oppoenent manages to hulk a guy out or has removal, you can do NOTHING in lane.

When someone is dominating a lane their opponent litterally cannot fight back. This plays as bad as it sounds.

I can see what Valve were going for, something strategic, but rather then a methodical play / counter play most of the games I've played have been one side snowballing on powerful cards and the other side not having enough ways to counter.

The worst part for me is the game just doesn't feel fun. It feels like the game was designed for compeditive play, Valve wrapped it in a public friendly IP, but only enough to draw people in. The current game modes feel like they're for people to practice and refine decks, they're not for two friends to sit down and play casually.

Valve make changes in the future, but I regret picking up the game as is.
**BUYERS BEWARE**

you might burn your trial refundable time only in the tutorial, because this game is sooooooo slow and I'm not talking graphically the turns take very very long sometimes and after you played +2 hours as you know steam doesn't allow refunds

also, this game is a huge cash grab, so if you intent to play it prepare your credit card if not you will be stuck in draft forever

the only positive point i will give to this game is, that is somewhat fun to play with friends, besides that avoid it a all costs, go and play another of the TCGs available with less agressive money grabbing practices
The card game itself is fun. The monetization scheme is BS in that you don't have any way to earn anything. I don't regret purchasing since I'll probably just stick to casual draft play anyway but honestly I wouldn't recommend this game unless you're the type that just loves buying card booster packs hoping to get rares worth selling which is actually just gambling and you're better off going to the casino.
Artifact is not free-to-play like many of its competitors, the game's monetization model sucks (pay-to-win) as new cards can only be purchased and not traded from the Steam Marketplace, or gained as rewards in specific drafting game modes that require the purchase of a ticket to participate in.
There's a lot of talk about this game and the monitization. 
I don't have a particular problem with it myself, but I do understand when one card is TOO good it's worth a high amount and dominates the game. There's also no way to earn new cards. This is a matter of debate because if Artifact now tries to transition to a way to get things for free, the current prices will drop, bots will be created to earn money off the cards, and you'll see a drop in real players and card value. That would blow for the people who have already bought the cards and would be fucking over their playerbase more than everyone preaches they already are.

But putting that aside, monitization is only going to work if there are cards that are extremely overpowered that are WORTH the buy. I've seen a million complaints about axe but for myself personally. Drow is more an issue. Cards being powerful is a part of them being rare and having neat effects. Instead, you have them far too powerful and dominate the game. Now this would be fine if we had the ability to play around this right? This raises my biggest complaint with Artifact.

RNG. There are so many elements not neccessary that have been added and scew the game from skill to getting lucky. You can lose your heros turn one depending on how many creeps went to a certain lane, how are they positioned, and how many there are. The creeps are then constantly thrown in random dirrections which makes characters like crystal maiden who needs something to block, harder to play. You can then be fucked over by the dirrection the enemies or yourself will hit. I've lost 3 games so far in my 25 hours of playing due to a random turn away from the tower when I either needed it to hit my tower, or I needed to hit theirs. This adds even more RNG which can just completely destroy the level of skill to this game.

Overall, I'll be satisifed with the game if the RNG factor changes. The cost of cards will fluctuate over time as new ones get introduced and the meta changes. The RNG destroys the game on a skill level which is inexcusable. RNG is fine for certain decks or characters, not for your base gameplay. (Save card drawing obviously.)
This game sux so hard.
1. Phantom Draft. If the people got a bad draft they surrender in the beginning. if they chose to play you know that their decks are op as fuck
2. cost so much what the fuck?
3. no progress
4. random as fuck
PRO's :
1,This game have some nice mechanic's

CONST's:
1.The games are to long for my personal taste....
2.P2W
3.The only way to get cards are through money transaction
4.The cards which are really good goes for ridiculous amount of money's

Too much randomness in the game. For instance you play a hero who then goes in a random position in the lane. Many cards send a unit to a random possition in a random lane. Many percents based cards.

Plus on top of all of the randomness the monitization is horrible. Coming from a company with a free game(Dota) and going against games like Hearthstone I see no reason in playing this except maybe a draft tournament against friends.
Just play Auto-Chess LOOOOOOL 4Head

Is actually pretty solid but gets boring really quickly and there aren't that many players. Auto-Chess is free and more fun than Artifact at the moment.
A neat idea in concept with an extremely poor implementation. There is not really any reason to actually play the game since there are no rewards for playing unless you are throwing away money every time you play. I personally cannot even play the game because I have recently returned to steam. Because I haven't been on for so long I cannot use the Steam Marketplace until pretty much 2019. Thus I am unable to even purchase cards to build decks on the Marketplace making an already unplayable game even more unplayable.
I actually think it has a healthy economy for a TCG, the community market makes it very accessible.
Honestly just very dissapointing, the ammount of RNG in this game makes my head hurt, i fail to understand why anyone would ever try to play this competitively, when if you win or lose is at least 40% decided by a coin flip, even hearthstone doesn't have this much RNG.
The game is amazing, hands down best virtual card game i've ever played BUT, it has some major flaws that wind up causing this review to be negative. If they get fixed, i'll change my review to positive:

1. There is a lack of features promised on release:
-No replay 
-No CHAT FEATURES or any social features other than challenging friends

2. There is a massive balance issue:
-Cheating death wins games, its a 50% coin toss for cards to survive.
-Drow ranger has a 4 mana card called gust that silences all enemys in a lane, rix has a 5 mana card that silences one creature. 
-Kanna has stats of 2/12 yet Prellex is 3/5, how are these stats decided?
-Axe is a 7/2/11, and has an amazing skill card, no other hero matches up to him except legion commander.
-Legion commander has an OP card and the stats are great.

These cards need to be fixed and the meta won't be stale.

3. Meta is stale: Refer to above

4. Lack of feedback or responces from devs about all the issues with this game.

5. Pay 2 Pay 2 Play. Draft cost money, cards cost money, virtually ALL competitive modes cost money...

Please valve, fix this game, its amazing, but these flaws have made me take a step back.
When you make a pretty alright card game and continue to fix it up. Just to shit the bed and decrease cardpack drops to 5 from about double that. Way to go.
The reason why this game never got a open beta is because it sucks. I do not recommend the game. Please dont waste your $20 dollars on the game. The game is pay to win and the matches take forever. Boring. Please dont buy, This game will go free to play in a few month, because this game is not worth $20.
Valve is a scummy company with anti-consumer refund policies for it's own game, and monetization of an insanely greedy corporation.  I will NEVER buy a valve game again, or one on steam for that matter.  

On top of that.  The game is slow, excessively RNG based for what it is intended to be, despite being a card game: RNG pack opens (don't tell me to drop hundreds on the marketplace after paying 20 for what you get for free in other TCGs), RNG cards that can end the game turn one.  I can see the—even more—P2W insane powercreep from months away.  This game is not worth buying IMO.

You have been warned. Save your money for something that's worth it and a company that reciprocates the respect you deserve.
Don't listen to the memers. The market is insanely pro-consumer and costs way less in the long run compared to a lootbox style card boi game.

Edit: I change my mind. There simply isn't enough content, and the queue is too dead. This game flopped. No matter how you see it, and even with a positive general outlook.
I'll keep this short since my previous attempt to review wouldn't post.

Gameplay feels exactly what I would expect if a moba like Dota was crammed into a card game. Unfortunately, RNG feels a bit unfair at this moment, detracting from any serious strategy as games of equal skill come down to coin flips. Losing games simply because minion spawns coupled with unit AI turn against you is a bitter pill to swallow.
I never thought I would give a negative review to a Valve game, but here we are. 

Good:
The core gameplay of Artifact is fun, interesting, and complex. The UI is slick, the animations are awesome, and as a dota 2 fan, the voice lines and tidbits of dota lore are cool! I don't even have a problem with the way the game is monetized. Many others have complained about the lack of rewards or free ways of earning new cards, but I have no issue with the "paper tcg" system Valve implemented.

Bad:
So why have I uninstalled Artifact? Two reasons: card design and over-complexity.

I know I listed complexity as a positive trait in the "Good" section above, and I stand by that. Complexity in a competitive game is a good thing. If you plan on spending a long time with a game, you want tactical depth and room to explore. A good competitive game provides opportunities for players to constantly discover new tactics and strategies. However, this complexity has to be balanced with a good learning feedback loop. In other words, when I try something in a game, I need to be able to judge how successful it was. Take Magic, for example. Once you've learned the rules of Magic and played a few games, you have a wealth of options for playing the game at your disposal. When you play a new decklist or are attempting to figure out the best line for the turn, you can always tell _after_ the game (or even after the turn or a single spell cast) what your mistakes were. You are able to determine whether your deck needs a better mana curve or more removal and you can also figure out whether you should have killed their big flyer instead of the trample guy on turn 5. The learning feedback loop in Magic is excellent. You may never know the best line of play in the moment, but you learn to make better decisions over time. I feel that the ways in which Artifact provides complexity, this feedback loop is not there. While playing Artifact, I can never tell if I made the right decision. "Should I have placed that guy in that lane?" "Should I have put that equipment on that hero?" I grew frustrated because when I lost, I could never tell what lost me the game. And because I could not feel myself improving, the game became unfun.

My second negative reason is card design. And by card design, I specifially mean Artifact's choice of randomness as a part of card effects. Again, randomness in a card game is to be expected. It provides exciting moments and keeps things fresh. In good games you learn to manage randomness and to play to your outs and probabilities. However, I feel that many random elements in Artifact are just unfun. There are many cards that provide randomness, but I will focus on one such card to prove my point. The card in question is called "Cheating Death," and it is a improvement card that provides a passive effect on your allied units that reads: "If there is an allied green hero in this lane, allies have a 50% chance of surviving with 1 Health when they would die." Simply put, the randomness of this card is not fun to play against. Your opponent might waste 4 removal spells to no avail because of a bad roll of the dice. If I cannot devise a strategy other than "hope I win the coin flip," I'm not going to have fun 50% of the time.
If you don't infinite with the first 5 tickets you get for buying the game you can never play a mode that will earn you cards again unless you continue to pay. I didn't bother learning the game before hopping into expert modes, because I assumed like any other online card game I would have some kind of opportunity to earn runs again through casual play. Somehow Valve thought it was okay to charge for the game in a genre that is always F2P and somehow is simultaneously the greediest of any online card game on the market as well. "B-but you can sell your cards and buy singles! It's not the same." Yeah, Valve also makes money on marketplace trading, so it's not like they're losing money.

Get gud is an argument I guess, but the game will probably be dead in like a month unless they change their monetisation.

Edit: Also no ranked mode
i really, really, really wanted to like this game but after 30 minutes of playtime i've come to a consensus, and i'm here to give you the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth, straight from the mouth of mine like it was god's own wisdom. you might have seen the hordes of loco reviews and thumbs downs but i'm here with the verdict, the only verdict that matters: the be all end all of steam reviews, drawn from my well of knowledge. i will warn you: if you are the irate, inept, unstable manchild of a gamer that permeates steam you will be unable to comprehend the raw undeniability of what i am about to say.  your life will be forevermore tainted by the night you read that steam review, the one on that card game that shattered your world, leaving you unable to form sentences, tie your shoes, even remember your name and condemning you to a life of insanity as your nerd world collapsed upon itself when you opened this forbidden knowledge. but had you the capacity to understand, or indeed form sentences, you would thank me for the supremacy of my reviewing of artifact. for a life without my review of artifact, is not a life worth living. i have spared you the ignomity of such a measly existence and deigned to write the commandments here. nothing else matters but this column, the inane babblings of "p2w", "not that bad of monetization", or "mtg" are nothing. for i hold the true nature of artifact, the facts, if you will. so let's get down to brass tacks and not waste time, let's get to the bottom of this, straight to the meat, past the bullshit, not wasting a second, here is the harsh, uncaring, untainted truth of artifact, which you can not reconcile or debate in any way, shape, or form:

Artifact is a digital collectible card game developed and published by Valve Corporation. The game focuses on online player versus player battles across three boards, called lanes, and is based upon the universe of Dota 2, a multiplayer online battle arena game also from Valve. Artifact was designed by Magic: The Gathering creator Richard Garfield, and allows for the buying and selling of cards on the Steam Marketplace. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in November 2018, and is planned for Android and iOS devices the following year.
Not really a diverse game and having only like ~300 cards isn't the real issue. You can only play cards on a lane if you have a hero on it. So naturally if your heroes die you loose the game for sure. Mulligans are not the only RNG in the game as units have their own will and sometimes refuse to attack the target you want. AND the start of the game is completely random too. Sometimes your starting heroes die on turn 1 because they may face a stronger hero on the other side. So these are 3 factors that are RNG.

So my experience after a few dozen game is that you watch unskippable and long animations for 2-3 minutes, while having very little control over what is happening on the board in each turn. The few cards don't allow the meta to go anywhere but the 2-3 deck that wins you games. Experimenting is actually punishing you.

And the rest?

There are no achievments, progression, no story, lackluster tutorial, no quests, no daily-weekly-monthly bonuses or login bonuses, you can only win packs for free if you already have one of the 2-3 meta deck to win them over. There are no rare or animated versions of cards, there are no sleeves and communication is limited. The options menu is a joke and customization is non-existant.

And as a veteran Dota player i am livid that they only introduced very few heroes from the game. The voice acting is cheap and the art on the cards is horrible sometimes / not in-line with the game.

Overall you better just play Shadowverse. That game is a prime example of how a CCG should treat new players. I got 10 packs for free from each expansion, a guaranteed legendary, in-game money, tickets for tournaments and all for just logging in for the first time. I spent only 10$ on that game and spent it on looks. In Artifact that money gets you 1 half of a good card.
Bad game! PAY TO PLAY! I recommend you not to buy, if you are poor, and unwilling to spend more on this game, then don't, end up regret buying.

一开始就是付费游戏呢！ 其实我并不是没有，问问大家的看法！这游戏是不是永远
The game is fun, it looks great and feels good as well. But I can not recomend it right away. The economy, the powerful cards costing a ton, no way to get cards without buying them and without that almost no reason to come back to the game unless winning is for you. You get nothing for playing so it feels almost empty or worthless to play epsically when pay to win players own the axe, drow and other 25$- 10$ cards. I would wait to buyt this game until valve does something as it just feels hollow and unintersting.
1. Why would i pay to play a game that relies so heavily on RNG. 

2. 

3. This has to be the most frustrating card game i have ever played

4. Skill makes no odds here RNG will fukk you every time.
After playing the new update for a bit, I still dont think that this game is as good as it can be. Make it free as well, given that the people that want to be good at the game are already gonna spend even more money on the cards.
Fun game completely ruined by the monetization strategy. Playing Artifact is like playing a completely different and new card game, that has a lot of interesting strategies. I'm sure a meta will ensue, but because of the action switching, it seems unlikely that an all powerful deck, or an unstopable OTK deck, will emerge. However, you flat out don't recieve enough cards at the start to fully enjoy this. Moreover, you can't get more cards without paying more. The game should have just cost $40 and given you three to four times the packs. Power users would still pay to get the cards they want. And, everyday people could enjoy a deck making expereince that doesn't revolve around finding which additional 20 cards do the least harm in your setup. But right now, I feel like I'd have to spend hundreds of dollars a year to enjoy my experience.
Artifact is the stellar opposite of dota and overall a terrible game. Even beyond the fact that it is heavy pay-to-win game - there is the problem that the game has almost no content - after you buy few packs of cards and you play several meaningless matches vs anonymous opponets - your only option to try something new is to spend more money. Byers beware - dont pay for this empty game.

Edit: 5 days in and i am already deleting this trash. Wont spend a single dollar on DOTA too from now on - i am firm believer that stupidity + greed shold be punished
Less features than any other card game, more RNG than any other card game. Not in the fun way. Terrible cash grab by Valve. Never buy/play, even if it's on discount.

- No campaign or story mode.

- You get cards by paying like you pay for skins on CSGO or Dota2

- No replay value unless you like to compete against other people with basic decks (unless you afford to pay for more and build your own).

- You are mostly stuck with 2 basic decks + 10 booster packs (still not enough to build a true custom deck)

- Want better cards? Want booster packs? Pay for it. Because there is no reward for your gameplay or deck creativity, the best card in this game is your credit card.


As much as I enjoy the complexity of the game, this is yet another money making farm for morons like dota2 and CSGO. Heartstone does a better job (despite gameplay being boring and simplistic), because you have a story mode and new cards to unlock. I payed 18€, not gonna pay for anything else.
This is the second card game i have played after gwent. And in my opinion this game is very slow and looooooong. I love dota and have almost 2.5k hours on it but this game is BORING when it comes to the final product. I don’t want to spend one hour just to finish one game. If you like hour long card games then this might be a good game for you. But for me its not.
Truly awful and easily the worst product valve has ever released. It was a 20 dollar game released in an imbalaced and awful state, even the bot matches or horrendous with games never being a challenge, bots either somehow magically get every single card they would need to help them every single time they are in a pinch or they simply sit there and play nothing waiting for you to finish to kill them. The monetization of the game is of course what is most pitiful. Valve thinks they have fixed it by giving you a few free booster packs if you level up but with a very limited amount of packs that you gain and no way of permanently grinding cards valve obviously wants you to shell out cash for cards in a game that already costs 20 dollars. Don't waste your time with this game, dont support the awful practices valve has emplaced by creating this. Because if I could use one word to describe this game it is pathetic.
really nice game, but the price modell is terrible,
can get most of the cards very cheap on the AH, thats a ok
but it feels terrible to invest money for getting better
cant recommend
Do not buy this game. If you are like me and gave up on Magic: The Gathering because of the fact that a lot of the cards were garbage compared to the God-tier rares and mythics that were always auto-includes and expensive as hell, then you are going to have the same problem here in Artifact,

I kept uninstalling and reinstalling the game. When it's fun and you and your opponent have a similar set of cards, holy hell it is fun. The gameplay loop is there and it is great. When things are even, it works. 

But when they put down those bullshit rare cards or heroes - you know the ones I'm talking about - and all you have in hand are commons and uncommons and what you started the game with...it's disheartening. It's like, you cannot play the game unless you pay out of the nose for it. I tried the phantom draft, but it only seemed to make the frustration even more rather than less.  

At least in Hearthstone you had an opportunity to actually get those cards or make them. Here the grind is slow...so very slow. Levelling up can be a horrible pain, especially given that you will loose to players that have better cards than you a lot. It doesn't feel fair, it doesn't feel fun. 

Do not buy. Do not waste your money here. Just...walk away. These kinds of games are terrible. They play terribly and almost always favor those that have more money over those that do not. 

The worst part of all? Even spending money is not a garauntee - I ended up spending $100 total on card packs...but my luck of the draw was terrible and I still am behind in many respects. It's not worth it. 

Stay away.
Some cards are so unbalance without any  side effect that make other cards looks like trash. YES THAT'S YOU, FUCK Annihilation. FUCK Emissary of the Quorum
I cant recommend this currently. 

I like the actual game play.  BUUUUUUUUT

Its pay to play, pay to win

It crashes a lot! This really sucks when you have used a ticket.
I can not recommend this game. Game is pretty terrible. I’ve played card games all of my life, and u know than Random is part of any card game. However, I do not like how you can not control what your lanes attack or assist with. 

I have lost several games because my unblocked creature attacks a worthless creep instead of hitting the enemy tower. 

In addition to this, minion and hero placement is also Random. In Dota, you control where your hero goes. In this game, you pick a lane, but they can land in any spot, even if here is one spot where they die the first turn they are summoned. 

I do like the new ranking system, but it is a complete joke that when you lose a game that lasts 15 turns you still only get like 6 experience, even though it was a “close match” the only real experience you get is the first 3 of the week, after that you are completely screwed. 

I still log in once in awhile to mess around, but every time I do I regret it. There is a reason why the game has almost no player base just a month or two after coming out. Don’t waste your money! If you do, you better hope you get cards that are worth what you paid for the game to break even! (Also, cards have gone down in price substantially because the game has almost 0 popularity)
Spent $20 on the game to find out that you don't have any means to unlock cards or coins or whatever on a day to day basis.  Took too long playing before I realized to get a refund.  Sold my collection for about $8 that I can only spend on Steam.  Wish I'd just spent the money on MTG Arena instead.
Trust me
you will pay more 
and more 
even hearthstone might cost cheaper than this shit cuz you dont 'REALLY' forced to pay
no progression and whatsoever






1 WEEK UPDATE 


EYY WE GOT 10K PLAYERBASE HAHAHA
IT WILL GROW LOWER AND LOWER LIKE OTHER VIRTUAL CARDS GAME OUT THERE
dont spend too much on cards, they will drop
Yeah, nah...I wouldn't recommend the game at it's current state. It is fun to play, sure, but there really isn't any incentive to play it. There are no quests, there are no achievements, there is no ladder, there is no progress to be made, other then paying more money money to complete your collection...to then do what? Look at it? Or buy all the cards and then pew pew pew the opponents that spent less money? I'm not against dumping money in a game, I spent more then 300€ on my Hearthstone collection, but I don't really see a point in doing the same for artifact right now. Especially since the game has so much RNG that you can lose to just 1 attack arrow placed wrong by the RNJesus.
One of the most expensive games to play on steam. Your purchase of the game gives you very limited options, essentially they want to gouge you for money not only for packs to play competitively but also just to play casually.  

A fun game but I would avoid.
Artifact is extremely pay to win.
You pay to own the game, you pay to play the game and you pay to win the game.
You can build OP decks if you are willing to spend money, but if you aren't then you are stuck with your starting cards.
You BUY THE GAME, and then you must pay even more money if you want to actually play well. You can not earn cards without paying money.

The actual gameplay is quite bad as well, incredibly RNG dependant and with lots of OP cards.
Not to mention it's quite boring even when you match against someone who didn't pay to be OP.
And you can't even get a refund, just hope your cards are worth enough to make back your money I guess. Though you can always be unlucky and have worthless cards and a boring P2W game left in your library.

Please do not encourage Valve by buying this game, maybe they'll try to make actual good games without terrible business tactics if these games of theirs don't succed.
I wish I could get a refund for this.
I really wanted to like this game, but this just seemed to be a game to pass time without any real aim or endgame.

And the core gameplay isn't really that fun when you get screwed over by rng
i spent my saving on this game, it was over 9000 real cash from my bank account, gaben told me he needed my card to check something. never got it back. i'm still missing a credit card to this date never understood why
Edit:
Original, positive review can be accessed below. I am going keep the new review brief.
I stand by what I said in the original review. I still believe that the monetisation is completely fair and this is not why I change my review. No, the reason behind it is RNG.

I enjoy the game when it flows well and they game is decided based on who played better, but too often the game is decided by RNG. And it's not that the game has a too much RNG, but the RNG that is there, has too much impact. You can play an entire game well and then lose because in the crucial moment 2 of your heroes decided to attack a creep and the creep ends up tanking 30+damage. 

Sure you can work around RNG and try to prevent RNG, but there is a key difference between this other card games, in a lot of other card games, you choose to add RNG to your games by playing RNG cards and then you have to deal with the RNG, but it was your choice. In this game, every single turn on every single lanes the targets are chosen randomly and you just have to deal with it. It feels like you have to fight against RNG every single match, which in my opinion is very bad, hence the change of the negative review.


Original review:
The game is amazing and negative reviews are undeserved, please do your research before you listen to all the negative reviews.

I am just posting a positive review to do my part in countering all the negative reviews from people who don't understand the difference between a CCG and a TCG.

For those who don't here it is:
CCG - Collectible card game.
TCG - Trading card game.

The difference is that in CCG you collect card, but in TCG you collect and trade cards.

The reason all other card game has a way for you to get cards for free like daily quests and other stuff is because they are all CCGs. That's why F2P CCGs can give you a legendary for free when you start the game for the first time or during an event, because cards are only in your collection and there is no way to just give it to a friend who wanted that legendary card. 

TCG on the other hand has a way for players to exchange cards between themselves. Which means that if you are missing a rare card that you want to put in you deck you can just go to the market place and buy it instead of having to spend money opening packs and hoping to get it. If you were given cards for free there would be no reason buy any cards because they wouldn't have the same value. The reason rare cards cost as much as they do is because you only have chance to get them from a pack. Now imagine if everyone who logged in got a random rare card. Their value would be 0 because people get them for free. Why would you pay for the card that you can get for free from a login, event or a daily quest? If there was a way to get cards for free the economy wouldn’t work because after some time market would be overflowing with rare cards that people didn't pay for.

I do have to say that there is 1 reason that I might change my recommendation in the future. And that's player to player trading. While I do believe that Artifact's monetization model is completely fair, their trading model is greedy. Cards can only be sold on the market and can't be traded between players. This means that you can't give cards to your friends for free, you must go through market. When you do go through market, Valve gets a % of every transaction. This is the greedy part of the game, not the fact that you must buy pack to get cards, that's just standard TCG stuff, no not being able to trade with people directly and having to go through a market is the "greedy" part. The reason for it of course is that it's how Valve are going to make the most money on the game and allowing for directly player to player trading would let people bypass the market and just create forums where they can just trade cards for other cards and not give Valve any more money. Because of this I don't think they will ever change how trading works.

To end on a positive note though Phantom draft that lets you draft for free (even if you don't get any cards) is an amazing addition to the game that I believe they didn't have to do and for me personally, I could sell all the cards I got from the 10 pack that you get when you buy the game and just play phantom draft and be happy with that. In case you don't know how the phantom drafting works, you essentially get to open packs, but you don't add cards to your collection. Instead you use cards from those packs to build a deck and play with it. After 2 losses or 5 wins (whichever comes first) you can start a new draft. So, you get to play with all the cards in that you get in those packs, you just don't get to keep them.

If you got this far into this recommendation, thank you for reading.
Dont waste your money and then time, you will regret spending on the wrong cards and have to buy more to win like i did... This game cost more than just the base price. ALOT MORE. How i wish i can refund everything now, oh well....
The definition of pay to play,there is absolutely no way to get packs for free(and it will stay this way as far as i know).DONT listen to ppl saying they bought the game and then sold everything for 50 bucks.Prices have nothing to do with when the game started.You will lose money unless you are really lucky.Game itself is pretty decent,i dont recommend it cause of the jew philosophy every steam game has nowadays.Fk gaben
RNG infested borefest with ZERO f2p progression. A quote from Steam user Butler that summarizes my opinion perfectly:

"99% of cards (for now, at least) relate to some combination of +/- damage and health. There are exceptionally few interesting or novel mechanics in play, with many of the genre staples having been left out (presumably to make the game feel different), and many of the interesting interplays between them left out too.

Add +1 health and +1 armor to your 8 health guy so that the 9 damage guy attacking him doesn't kill him this turn. Add 1 armor and 1 damage to the guys next to your guy. Meanwhile, your opponent is doing exactly the same kind of thing, nullifying each other’s plays more often than not. It's exactly as boring as it sounds. 

You also don't manipulate the cards on the play area and battles happen more or less automatically, with a little (fairly unwelcome) RNG thrown in to control the direction of attack. This removes a lot of decision making and agency and feeling of involvement that you get in other card games.

The whole thing ends up feeling over-thought, and playing it feels pedestrian and spreadsheet-like. No amount of fancy attack animations can overcome how dull your row of numbers hitting against their row numbers feels."
Between your hand, improvements, creatures, and items, there are far too many actives, and no good UI combining them all, making it very ackward and confusing to keep track of and use things scattered literally everywhere.  Wouldn't recommend in it's current state.
The game itself is fun most of the time. At times though you are going to feel like you are getting screwed over for no reason just because the game randomly decided to throw a bunch of creeps in your way saving your opponent. There's also the fact that there is no way to earn card packs outside of paying real money and that is just trash. It's a free to play model in a game that cost $20 already. Hell most free to play games are way better than that even. How you could release it like this when you already have a model for how players can earn cards in a game like gwent. Don't waste your time until they decide to stop being a bunch of money grubbing assholes at valve even when they are already making money hand over fist they feel the need to fuck your wallet even more. Absolutely shameful.
Artifact is a game about deploying heroes, equipping them with items, casting spells and summoning creeps with the goal of shaping the three ever-changing lanes of the game board to your advantage - or your opponent's disadvantage. 

Don't get me wrong - Artifact is fun. Infuriatingly so, in fact.
If all you're interested in is a draft mode: Go for it, the gameplay is deep, and refreshingly different from other card games in the sense that it's not about micromanaging your units but instead about using spells and your heroes to manipulate the board situation you're presented with to lead to your victory by balancing between defence and offence.

This is wonderfully supplemented by the three-lane-system which encourages you to split up the resources you're given and to figure out the best win condition to go for in your current situation.

These decisions the game gives you are then taken even further with the gold and items, which you can use to interact with your heroes, and serve as a secondary card resource other than the spells you play with mana - interchangable in some ways, giving you even more opportunity to take calculated risks and set your priorities.
The unpredictable nature of non-hero creeps and placement does introduce RNG into the core gameplay, but also ensures you're almost certain to continually face different board states, and to not get tired of the same situations repeating again and again too quickly.

These decisions also cause Artifact to be the closest you'll get to having a personal playstyle in a card game as opposed to having it dictated by your deck. 
In theory, it also lessens the impact of netdecking, because individual player skill in the match itself takes on a greater role compared to the deck alone than some of the competition.
It doesn't undermine the importance of a well balanced and thought out deck, however.

The importance of playing around situations you're presented with leads into deckbuilding and thinking about ways to improve your deck to adapt to certain enemy strategies et cetera naturally leads to deckbuilding being a marvellously fun thought process of theory crafting and playing around - which leads directly into the main downfall of Artifact - the "Economy".

It feels like Richard Garfield and Valve designed an economy consisting of loot boxes (card packs) and a card stock market with a game attatched to it, influencing some design decisions negatively. 
They want to stay as close to physical card games as possible by only balancing cards in extreme cases, which is an interesting idea, because especially in deep games, the meta tends to evolve without any change to the core game itself - see Starcraft 2, where one player managed to completely tip the scales in a matchup considered one-sided for years.
[strike]This design decision, however, appears to have mostly been made to reassure [strike] stock traders [/strike] players that their "investment" would retain its value, putting economy over gameplay.[/strike]
Edit: This decision has recently been changed, marking a step in the right direction.
Furthermore, a way to earn a limited number of cards by gameplay has also been added.
Nevertheless, the game remains pay to win after purchase, and thus it still has a long way to be able to be called a game with a "fair" monetization system.

This leaves Artifact as a game full of potential castrated by its outdated monetization scheme.
Valve have shown that they can do better with DOTA 2 and it's horribly disappointing to see them turn to pay to win with a really promising title.

NOTE: At the time of writing, a full base set of Artifact cards can be bought for approximately $180. This is cheaper than most other digital card games on the market, save for maybe Gwent. So if you're ready to shell out that sum for a mostly complete experience in a card game (save for the "expert" modes which require a $1 buy-in) this is probably what you're looking for.
However, this being "cheaper" than most others is not an excuse - it's a video game, and others in the medium do not get this free pass. 
I highly doubt that the development cost for card games is higher than something like a competitive shooter or a MOBA in terms of game design or balancing, and see no reason why card games should be treated differently in that regard. 
The previously mentioned DOTA 2 is a prime example of a competitive game done right, and Valve have definitely proven they can be successful with such a model, making Artifact even more disappointing.
As of 18 Dec 2018, this game still remains pay to pay with zero incentives in terms of progression in the long run.
The game has some depth to decision making, but valve is just too greedy on this one.
You're better off playing hearthstone than this game because of the zero progression system.
Absolutly Trash P2W game don't let Valve marketing fool you, Also people have reported that valve gives people who give positive review in game card packs, this is a Scam dont fall for it
The new update was definitely a step in the right direction, hopefully the game keeps going that way.

However it also came with a severe cut to the starting bundle, over 50% removed with only a quiet change to the store page announcing it.  One step forward one step back.
Game is fun but some of the cards are just Fucking dumb. Like was Valve high on crack? A Blue Lina card does 6 dmg to every unit and it only costs 3 points?! (litteraly made me lose a game that was insanely in my favor) Some other bitch summons a horde of units for every unit damaged including own units whenever she wants?! A tower defense card that does 2 damage to every enemy in lane at the start of every combat sequence. Centar is cancer too. (Just destroys everything in it's lane.) Get fucking real Valve. Ive seen sime shifty stuff but this is blatant ignorance. And I haven't played one game where I took the first turn. WTF is that shit?
This is definitely the dumbest game I have played to date.

It's not a strategy game at all. It's an endless cheese battle of who has the stupidest card they can play. Yeah, there are possible thousands of ways to play the game but the only viable strat is a zerg strategy. 

That's not a strategy game. This is a waste of time.
Yap, after ~200 hours after a positive review, now i'm giving negative one, without big changes no incentive to play more, player base dropped to very low, everything just went downhill, it's sad because the game IS GOOD, but they've missed the opportunity. 
I feel that i've wasted my money....oh well, fool me once!
Again, this can all change in the future, since i really like the gameplay and all, but we need variety in everything, and the game to be more accessible for new players.
With your purchase, only half of the game is available to you without paying more money. And this for me, is unacceptable. Unless something changes, at the moment, I don't recommend playing this game at all.
I've played  Hearhtstone for 2 years in the past. This game seems unnecessarily complicated. Games also last way too long for my taste. I remember my first few days in Hearthstone and I basically couldn't stop playing. This game doesn't have that at all. All in all, I find the game uninteresting.
I'll admit I've only played Artifact twice. The game looks professional, and I really want to like it, but the gameplay is boring.

I don't know how to approach this game strategically. Most of the time I'm not sure whether I'm making a good or bad play. I don't expect to be good at this game right away, but I just don't immediately understand the impact of my decisions like I do in other TCG/CCGs.

I am very experienced with other games in the genre. I have top cut events in Pokemon TCG. I have countless legend finishes in Hearthstone. I'm not saying this to brag, simply to explain I spend a lot of time playing card games.

Artifact just doesn't engage me enough to want to figure it out.

No zoom out to play 3 lanes must constantly look at one lane despite the game constantly being play on 3 lanes. Unfun RNG with lanecreeps, where your units attack, and starting position of heroes.
Much too expensive. This game basically has 10% skill, 50% money and 40% luck of how your cards come out of the deck into battle. Sure there can be a certain thing you try to achieve with your deck, but in the end its rng which wins you the game. +its just pay to win right now. There are like 10 good cards which you need to win competitive and each costs more than 10 bucks.. Yeah no, maybe in a couple of months/years it will get better.
Pay money to play ranked? how about F ur self valve. This is fucking bullshit. No progression nothing. Only way is to PAY money after PAYing for the game. If I pay $20usd upfront I expect a game. Not 1/4 of a game. Literally worse than activision/blizzard. Aleast they let u play ranked for free and the ability to earn literally ANYTHING from the game.

Dont buy this garbage. This is worse than a f2p + P2W model.
A confusing mess of a card game that might interest dota 2 fans but did anyone really ask for a game like this to be made? Not fun or interesting to play. I tried the tutorial and found myself completely lost after 10 minutes.
Don't buy the game or invest into it, all your cards will lose value to Valve buffing/nerfing cards. Don't waste your money like i did, supporting this lying, false-advertising company
Worst card game i've ever played. ALL games are about rng, no matter what you do, its the game who decides who wins.. Coin flip is more fair than this shit. Don't and won't ever recommend this game since it would need a whole remake (game from scratch) to even make sense. Wasted 20$ on game and 10$ on packs..
Purely pay to win. People think it's a good thing because it came from Valve. Criticizing the game on the forums gets you banned. Stick with Hearthstone. For the record, I spent over 100 dollars on packs, so I'm part of the problem I guess.... or salty that I didn't get Axe.

Edit: Real-talk review after playing more:

I'm going to be real with you.  This is a pay to win game.  I spent over 100 dollars buying packs and if I didn't I wouldn't be competitive at all. I'm still not competitive. If I spent that 100 dollars buying packs on Hearthstone, which I have done when a new expansion is out,  I could have dusted the repeat cards and gotten the legendaries I wanted. Here, you dust to get event tickets. Also only 20 or so cards are actually more worth .03 or more cents. This isn't a "Trading" Card Game, it's Magic Online (Not Arena) with Valve being the seller instead of 3rd party robots. You gotta pay to play here. I'm sorry, but it's the truth.

Edit 12/8/2018:

This game is dead. Valve has ignored it since release. Don't waste your money. Also Hearthstone is expensive too but at least it's not dead.

Edit 12/30/2018:

This game is on life-support. Only 2 updates and no roadmap. It's fun but there is no effort being put here by the developers or engaging with the community. I think Valve finally realized that they were tricked by "pro" players and the rich streamers into beta which only made those players money in tournaments, but yeah... Still don't buy. Wait and see until June. You're not missing much. Better games to spend your money on.
There is a 27 percent rake in the game. The fees are ridiculous. It really is pay to pay. I love the gameplay, but the model is the worst I have ever seen


https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/a221r3/math_in_artifact_4_fixing_the_reward_structure_of/
I will change my review when they get less greedy.
 Im ok with microtrasaction but at least get a option to obtain them free with labor. 

*I want to add there a difference between virtual and real card.

The Virtual can be Updated.
so a 0.03¢ card can become 15$
or you can spend 30$ on a card the next week they nerf it and drop to 0.03¢

Real card once they are printed well too bad there no coming back.

so basicly Valve will nerf card to buff other making a infini loop where you alway spend money. Thats why i dont like the system they going for.

please let me know if you agree or not in the comments
I was hyped for Artifact because the gameplay is actually pretty nice but unfortunately this game disappointed me a bit.

[b]-The economy is awful:[/b] [u]no way to get packs in game[/u], you can just buy them or spend event tickets (which you need to buy with real money) to participate in competitive tournaments, which are the ONLY competitive game modes in the game. Valve also takes a HUGE CUT on the Steam Market. If Valve wanted to get extra money so bad they should have just added cool skins/emotes/taunts. Cannot even trade cards with friends!

[b]-No "social" features, like the game was advertised[/b]: no replays, can't spectate friends playing, can't chat with the opponent, you can't even add an opponent as a friend after playing with him [u](in fact multiplayes feels like playing against bots, there's no interaction AT ALL).[/u] Even the game trailer is misleading.

[b]-No MMR/Ladder system or any progression system[/b]: there's no motivation to play.

[b]-No profile page/stats[/b]: there's no profile tab, can't see any stats, no way to see gauntlets best runs in a single page... Would be cool to have a more social profile page with favorite decks/cards, best runs, etc.

[b]-No way to get better analyzing past games[/b]: no post-game stats, no replays and no game history, which all prevent a player to get better.

[b]-Doesn't even feel competitive[/b]: you need to pay for the competitive modes, no MMR system (no leaderboards or anything like that).

All this makes me sad because the gameplay is good. Richard Garfield made an excellent job. 
Please Valve fix this stuff!
The game itself looks really promising but the monetisation system is terrible. You have to pay for the game and then feel like Kenny from South park cause you will be smacked by pay-to-win decks over and over again . The notorious thing is that there is no way to obtain vital cards but to buy them on the market or pay 50$ for 25 packs. I've never thought i would say that, but even Hearthstone looks like a charity festival after that. It really reminds me of the Star Wars Battlefront II scandal, you pay for the game and have to pay 3 times more to enjoy it. Even Diablo Immortal (yes, i said that) is better than this game cause it at least provides you with tools to earn resources without paying. I hope Valve will do something about it cause right now Artifact is a very unfair free to play game you have to pay for to even launch.
It's a great concept, and even has a fantastic completely free non-p2w mode (Casual Phantom Draft).  However, just about every other aspect of this game is completely demolished by its business model: constructed is incredibly pay2win, they refuse to balance the game (or even work out incredibly annoying RNG garbage) on the basis that it would "hurt people's investments", and gambling is encouraged by this system with this Toys-R-Us stock market sim.

If you are willing to put down $20 for a single gamemode of a card game and to finish your Valve game collection, go for this.  You can even sell off your entire starting collection to get some Steam credit back if you never want to play constructed.  But, the business model and direction of the game is just so horrible that I can't recommend it if you want to actually play anything that isn't the one (admittedly limited) good mode.
So, I wanted to like this game, I really did. It's presented well, the game mechanics are pretty distinct from other card games, especially the 3 lane system. Playing the game itself feels good. It feels like every game is extremely well balanced with the victor only winning by one turn, otherwise their oponent would have won, that kind of thing. But then you realise that these kinds of games only happen when you play casual games or games with your friends... because they all have the same shitty cards as you. 

You see if you want to get new cards in this game you have three options: you can buy them individially from the market place, buy new packs or participate in matches using a ticket with which you can win 1 pack if you win 4 games before you loose twice or 3 packs if you win 5 times. Should be noted for fairness that you win the ticket back of you win at least 3 games. 

Here's the problem. You will NEVER win the games that let you win cards, why? Because eveyone that plays this mode had already paid the dosh to aquire really great cards, cards that you're never going to win against by using what you have. Sure, you might have gotten a good card or two from the free packs you got after completing the toutorial, but it's no where near enough. The game enters a dead end as soon as you finish the toutorial. You can either play casual games and get NOTHING from doing it, or you can shell out the dosh even more to have a chance at winning some cards by using tickets. Or if you're feeling lucky you can pour money into card packs and hope you get a good return. But how much money should you spend? How do you know when your deck is good enough? Well that all depends on how lucky you feel and how big the others players wallet is. Nothing to do with your own individual skill. You could be a master at this game and you would still eat the dirt simply by someone being able to buy better cards than you. 

I wanted to like this game, I really did, truley. But you will need to spend money to enjoy this, even more than the cost of the game in some cases, with some of the best cards supposedly being sold for more than the cost of the game itself at the time of writing this...
Got this game for "free" cause i went to TI8, so i decided to play. Did the training opened up my 10x packs, got shit. I checked the steam market of course ppl selling cards. I did the math out of the 10 packs i opened my deck is worth less than $2USD. Got shit cards. 


So i decided to play against other ppl, man some ppl already have pay2win decks that absolutely crushed me with my shit starting deck in less than 4 turns. 



I feel scammed and disappointed, Artifail is the worst game i bought this year, and surprisily is for my favorite company, pls refund my 20$ usd, greddy fucks :)
Can't be refunded once a purchase has been made.
No way to "earn" packs in order to expand collection without use of the market place.

Insane amounts of RNG involved in so many aspects of the game. 
Some game changing moments are decided on a 50% chance of invulnerability.

The cost to enter some formats of the game just seems completely unrewarding.

Biggest buyers remorse of 2018 for sure and a real shame to see it come from a dota game - which is so accessible 

2/10


Too much variance from the first turn, your decisions almost don't matter if you lose heroes on turn 1 due to placement of units that you have no control over. Compare it to a game such as Hearthstone or Magic. What's the worst that can happen on turn 1 in these games? Your opponent plays a 1 mana minion and you don't have a play. The worst that can happen in Artifact is you lose all 3 heroes, you have no cards to play in response, your opponent has cards to play as well, draws cards he can play on the next turn because his heroes aren't dead, he buys items from the hero kills so that his heroes also survive turn 2, and at that point the game already lost.

Sure there are cards that can change attack directions or unit placement or alter randomness in general but you need to draw them, so again there's no decisions to be made, the game is still largely decided on the 5 cards out of 40 in your opening hand plus starting spawns.

For games to be close you and your opponent both need to be playing cards in response to one another but when one person has 3 cards to play on round 1 and/or get hero kills, and the other person does not, the game will usually snowball out of control for one player. This is what makes the game feel unfun - because before the game has even started, your chance of winning is arbitrarily decided.

Sure, it's not impossible to win a game that started poorly but when you go through 15-20 minutes just to still lose a game you were losing from the first turn, you just think "what was the point in even trying". And when you do win a game that you were losing from the start imagine what your opponent was thinking - they felt were ahead for most of the game and lost due to one lucky draw or one good turn. It doesn't feel fun to win due to luck and it feels even worse to lose because of it.

Rarely do you get a close game where both players are having fun because that requires both players to draw good cards consistently so that they both have cards to play in response to each other.

Most cards are deliberately bad, and a few are ridiculously strong which makes winning games mostly reliant on drawing these one-card win conditions when you have enough mana, not gaining small incremental advantages from making better decisions than your opponent. Some of these cards did get nerfed, but the nerfs were most likely only because players were dropping like flies, and they still are because the core gameplay is still the same. Even if the game were to become balanced, that doesn't make it fun to play. Flipping a coin is balanced, that doesn't mean it's fun.

It's no coincidence that many late game cards with powerful effects that almost win the game on the spot are also the highest rarity e.g. Emissary of the Quorum, Time of Triumph, Incarnation of Selemene, Apotheosis Blade, Horn of the Alpha.

The last two are the most expensive items in the game (25 gold) so you'd think if you managed to acquire that much gold, then it can't have been due to luck but no, there's a 9 gold item (Golden Ticket) that gives you [i]any[/i] random item, so if you get some lucky kills on turn 1 or 2, and the ticket gives you an expensive item on turn 2 or 3, the opposing player is probably going to immediately surrender.

One of the most powerful heroes in the game is Drow Ranger and it was initially an uncommon card. Valve's solution wasn't to change any of it's stats, but to make it rare instead. If that's not a sign of careless greed I don't know what is.

This did affect it's occurence in draft mode, but draft mode also has it's flaws. Phantom draft can either be played for free with no reward, or paid for with Event Tickets and potential rewards for winning 4 or 5 games before losing twice.

So naturally, newer players who are aware they are not good at Artifact will avoid the paid mode because chances are they will not recoup their investment. The problem with the free phantom draft is there is no cost whatsoever to draft a deck. Other card games that have a draft mode at least cost in-game currency which takes time to earn.

If you want to practice getting better at draft in the free mode so that you can become good enough to win rewards from the paid mode, you're going to play against players that will keep drafting (and abandoning) decks until they get an amazing deck that can easily go 5 wins versus players that are actually playing draft mode in the intended way, where you try and build a deck with subpar cards that you wouldn't normally use in constructed.

I don't normally make reviews but if there's any game that people need to know to stay away from - at least in it's current state, - it's Artifact.
It's a well designed game, with lots of potential, but Valve can't be trusted to do right by their customers. Shortly after release, with card prices high, I decided to get in on the ground level. I spent more money than I wish I had, but given their promise not to nerf cards, I bought in - confident that at least that scarcity would count for something even if future sets balanced some of these cards. Seeing their userbase flee upon release, they rethought their policy and nerfed cards - offering the people who had paid for them their money back (at a fraction of the cost). I felt betrayed - not something you want your ideal potential customers to feel. I think they should have rewarded the early adopters, not punished us. That said, I haven't played since that patch. Maybe I'll keep an eye on the game going forward, but I won't recommend it to friends. Unmerry Christmas, Valve. :(
+ Draft is neat
+ Bots seem decent (not amazing, though)
+ Music is good
+ Dota characters/lore is nice

- Expensive if you want to play constructed
- Expensive if you want to play expert modes
- Limited, low amount of free packs
- Bad types of RNG
- Too much bad RNG
- The Imps are annoying
- Low (dying?) playerbase


The game isn't marketed well towards people who don't have much money to spend but still want to experiment with various different constructed decks (so people like me) and it has too much shitty RNG. Cards like Ogre Magi and Bounty Hunter could be reworked to be consistant and you could reliably predict their power, but Valve doesn't seem interested in doing that: The base mechanics (hero placement, creep placement, targeting arrows, etc.) show off that having bad types of RNG is a very integral part of the game, so it is unlikely to change. Even if you can sometimes plan for some RNG happening, it feels extremely frustrating to lose simply because your opponent won a 25% chance roll.
So the strategy for this game is
[strike]1. Buy it[/strike]
[strike]2. Open packs[/strike]
[strike]3. Sell all the cards and literally make profit[/strike]
[strike]4. Play the game for free and just play casual phantom draft / gauntlet[/strike]
*edit*
[strike]5. When you level up from casual phantom draft you get packs so sell those too[/strike]

*final edit*
Made profit from this game but the devs have put the gautlet rotation to 11/01/2029.
Artifact has had its funeral and is now buried at peace, don't buy it.
I play Pokemon, Yugioh, Magic, and hearthstone and Ive got to say this game is awesome.  Very unique and entertaining game play.  Too bad its 20 bucks AND cards arew hella expensive.  oh oh oh and then there is having to pay to get into the more competative game mode as well.  Fix it Valve please.
An excellent card game, flawed by a terrible monetization scheme. If you are ready to spend 300$ + to get a full collection then be my guess otherwise u gonna stuck with the cards u get
This game requires no skill, decisions dont matter, you will spend time, effort and money building decks and making decisions and at the end of the day nothing will matter because 90% of what happens in the game is decided by a random number generator, if you want to look at cards while Valve's server computers play the game for you, then this game is exactly what you need.
Warning. If you open the 10 starter packs that they give you which I assumed was for the $30 dollar entree fee. You will not be able to request a refund. Even if you are under the 2 hour mark of play time (I was at 66 minutes). There is no way to earn in game currency. You pay $30 to get in. To Pay $3.00 a pack. I'd rather have spent $30 on a noose then play this greedy cash grab of a game.
I really want to like this game. It's got fresh gameplay and depth.

The RNG ranges from shitty, to manageable and lending to strategy.

Some heroes are just way more powerful than others.

Player base keeps shrinking.

It's a huge money sink.
Horrible monetization. Very little ways to earn packs in-game and almost no ways to earn tickets to participate in events that reward either additional tickets or packs.
Way too much lazy unfun RNG, constructed unavailable unless significant extra money spent, even with the new reward system it's hard gated how much you can earn, and winning in the only meaningful free mode, phantom draft, doesn't feel rewarding. Not fun to watch either.
Pay to Pay with the only defense being "But other card games also suck in that regard" as if it's an inescapable part of the genre and not something Valve just decided to keep because they can.

Otherwise the gameplay does seem fun and I'm torn on whether to keep the game for the Phantom Draft mode, but would only recommend buying to anyone absolutely certain they're happy with this monetization as you appear to not be able to progress further than the tutorial matches without losing refund eligibility.
I was all for this game until valve destroyed the value of the cards. They also nerfted expensive cards. Really poor execution of managing the game. Will be staying away from valve games after this and not buying anymore cards on the market place.
Pros:
It has a market?
Col new mechanics and gameplay

Cons:
Nothing really game breakingly new , just a new twist on DCG
No trading
pay2play
No progression
Insane market taxes
Most powerful card is your credit card


Fuck you valve.I was hyped and pre-ordered. Regret immediately.
Don't believe the positive reviews. Artifact is desperately lacking in character and this is not compensated for by the very average gameplay.

It is worth pointing out that the advertising blurb is factually incorrect:
"Artifact offers the deepest gameplay and the highest-fidelity experience ever seen in a trading card game."
Artifact offers similar depth to games like Hearthstone, Pokemon and MTG. Not terrible but certainly not pushing any boundaries. If you want "the deepest gameplay" then look up Netrunner.
This is the worst marketing ploy I've seen and unfortunately invested in. Feels bad. Utterly disastrous that this could come from Valve. Stay as far away as you can.
This game is amazing graphically and play wise. 
There is only one problem. 
YOU CANNOT PROGRESS WITHOUT MONEY THERE IS NO WAY TO PLAY THIS GAME FOR FREE
Can't recommend this game.

While it is really fun, the randomness is a little overwhelming and many cards feel useless, especially early on. Luckily, I was able to sell the cards for about 70% of what I spent, including the initial purchase. I feel like it has promise, but I am not willing to spend any more time on this product until then.
I do well in Magic (MtG), even without spending money

I did well in Blizzard's abomination hearthstone without spending money

zero, absolut zero change of getting anywhere without buying truckloads of cards here.

opponent players loaded with rare cards just crushed me. over and over again. And I've played trading card games for like 2 decades.

this game is designed to drain your wallet. it's not a game. it's a scam.

MtG is a damn good game that inevitably rewards spending money, but it's about your skill.

Blizzard's inept, dumbed down clone is mostly about luck anyway.

Artefact is designed to leech $. it is so obvious. 

no work went into the art, there is no new lore, no interesting ideas, no flavor to the game.
Blizzard at least got the bling right. Artefact feels like someone took DoTA2 and copy pasted the art assets onto a bunch of cards. horrible.

and sorry, but breaking the game up in 3 parts, while cutting down the positioning and timing, isn't adding anything. it's just hiding how limited the game is compared to MtG

more often than not, the game decides if you win or not(!), since blocking is based on luck not strategy when the game decides that your randomly spawned cards are aiming at an angle, or your placed cards are opposed at an angle.

the player seems to have zero control.

it is probably the most disappointing title this year. (I knew fallout 76 would be trash)

come to think of it, but it really seems like just as Fallout 76 copy pasted Skyrim & Fallout 4 assets and called it a new game, so did Valve with the art on the cards in Artefact.
Highly not recommended, also there is no button to restrict if you are gamble addicted, and this game defenetly gambling where are you losing real money
tldr Dont buy its rigged. If the opponent starts first and kills your hero before combat phase you cant play cards. They can use free charge abilities and clear your board before you can even touch your cards. Same shit the latest tournament winner abused.

Too much "Haha I remove your card or attack your card with this shop item or 1 mana card before the combat phase" bullุshit.
80% of my games revolve around someone removing a hero before anything can happen. Does not feel like a card game.

This is the FPS of card games with everyone running around with an AWP.

*Update*
Sold all cards and uninstalled
This is really not a card game. I hope you all get fired for tricking Gabe with this whole bonus scheme.
The Blue deck has become the new cancer which revolves around removing all of the cards from the board with low mana but high damage AOE cards. This was balanced before because the Green deck was strong but now with Valve nerfing Green cards it is a disaster.
Everyone is running blue deck and waiting until third round to start clearing boards with OP cards and there is literally nothing you can do unless you want to spend money on a useless mana drain deck that cant do much in general.
If you thought Hearthstone was casual... wait until you try this game out. It is the Rick and Morty of card games. It requires no thinking. Just tempo abuse which Garfield said wouldn't exist but here we are.
Adding a opportunity to get infinte Mana in a Card Game is a dumb decision in my opinion, dont talk about balance when i need to lose against it every game.
I purchased this game at launch and after just under 2 hours of play, I was completely turned off. The game itself is was decent and well made, though each match can take a while. Playing competitive cost money and there was no progression or rewards system. I requested a refund and was denied because I opened the card packs. How else was I supposed to try the game? I feel like Valve should have honored my request and others like it. The technology to know if any cards I opened left my inventory certainly exists. The technology also exists to remove any Artifact game assets from my inventory. Refunding me would have meant that I would have been willing to potentially give the game another chance in the future, should they have made changes that addressed my concerns. Since my request was denied, all goodwill was lost and I will never touch the game again. It appears that I am not alone. 

If you wonder why Artifact has lost so many players so quickly, my story is just one small piece of the puzzle.
I was optimistic about this game, i really was. 

Boy was i dissapointed.

Even after getting a FREE copy of the game and playing only 30+ hours it just saddens me. It struggles from some very poor design choices and has no really good gameplay value. The market for this game was already struggleing but now its just a pay to win game. You really cant play the game without spending any money at all. Even other games like hearthstone and such give you at least a way to earn free packs. I already uninstalled the game and sold all my cards.

Here's a fun fact: More lanes in a card game doesn't equal a better game. It makes it more confusing and if anything just tedious to play.

I see what they were trying to do with the three lane thing but it just doesn't work at all in a game like this with some bs rng. 

What valve should do is focus on what made them great and not try to reinvent the wheel so to speak.

Its a sad day when your old games like Left 4 dead 2, CS source, and Portal 2 have more players than your new game. [i]Yikes[/i]
Find a different game to invest your money in. If you look at my profile you can see some other card games I've played.... This is not balanced at all. There are quite a few problems beyond balance but I don't even care to list it. Others have done so already My recommendation at this time is no. While it's a fun concept it needs work. If they offered it for free, and had real playable goals to get more free content continiously then they would be closer to having something worthwhile.
One of the worst communities of gamers I've had to deal with in years, pay to win format, tossed in with a dumb luck type of randomization that makes you quit if you lose a guy in the first turn. Horrible that they decided not to test it more before launch and I've already been suckered into spending nearly 100$ with almost nothing to show.
This is the worst game I ever buy. Even it's last update nerf some card but still  there are many card that make this game unbance and out of control. You can lose many time in the same way like unable to counter construct or all of you creep and hero are destoryed in one card or spend to many time to detroy tower because your hero away hit the creep. And if you win most of my play time it because you draft more op than you oppenent and RNP not because of your strategy. That why if you lose you will not want to rematch even if you win, you still dont want to play again.
Not very good.

While I'm not clamoring for a refund, the practices mentioned in other reviews are SUPER fucking shady.

I left the game running all day because I launched it and then forgot about shutting it down, so it was open the 10 or so hours I was at work.  That's my fault and I accept responsibility for it, so understand I'm out the chance for a refund no matter what.

It's a scattered game, and in the bit I played the forced tutorial meant I didn't really get exposed to much of the game, and it wasn't very challenging.   The card variety that I've gotten to see is also super poor, and given the mechanics that demand purchasing and/or paying for more cards, that means I'm not likely to get many more cards and see how they interact and whether there's the fun combinations and styles of decks other games offer.

The current impressions are that it's not fun.   It doesn't seem to have exciting cards with fun effects, but rather stock cards do stock thing, nothing that seemed super interesting so far.   It doesn't mean they don't exist, it means I didn't encounter it in my bit of playing and during opening my initial packs.

I highly recommend a pass on this game, it's simply not there currently, let's hope future iterations and patches fix things, but, I fear the base premise of the game itself with the three boards is super flawed and means that the game will always be scattered and not fun to play.
Yo what the heck Valve? I give you 20 bucks, you give me 10 packs and basic cards, then don't give me a way to earn more in game?  Why would I give you 20 bucks then????  
Pay to play but also Pay to win? I thought you guys were better than this.

The game mechanics are fine, but honestly the turns last too long, everything has so much health that it's just a chore.

Non basic minions are kinda lame and uninspired.  They look really generic and the gameplay of the heroes is lack luster in all honesty.   Some have cool active abilities but most are passive and just a bit situational.  Then there are vanilla ones which I can't fathom to understand why.  

It's 2018, there should not be bad cards in this game, nor should I have to pay 20 bucks and then be asked to pay more.  Honestly a big rip off since I can't earn cards in game.  I'll stick with Hearthstone and Eternal.
It took awhile for people to figure it out, but now the pay to win decks are everywhere in constructed. Otk turns that summon 70 points of damage on turn 4. You can't possibly keep up. 

The draft mode of the game is still fun, but constructed is an absolute mess.
REALLY well designed game, I mean SUPER WELL DESIGNED!!!
It looks great and the mechanics are fresh, new, and interesting. I get what they were going for with making everything cost money, but you don't get anything from anything. You WILL be paying money on this game or it won't be fun. There is no ranked, so unless you are playing with your event tickets (1 dollar each), you have no reason to care about the game. They have been vague with what is coming, but I doubt it will fix the issue of not earning anything. You literally earn 0 cards after the purchase after you use up your first 5 tickets. I really believe that this is a good game, but there is no progression, no rewards, no rank, no way to earn cards. 
Maybe buy it later.
Don't buy it now
Also the RNG is bullshit.
this game is really hard to me for play if you want to play for kill time just play the other game.

and i play  1 hr. and not open the pack and can't refund.

think first to buy this game
Do I recommend this game? No, at least not yet. Until valve somehow manages to reduce the cost, I would say keep ur money and play Hearthstone or Magic the gathering: Arena instead.

A word from a cheap ass person who doesen't like spending money lol.
To start with, the actual game itself is fun and a unique take on the regular card games that've came out in recent years. This is completely overshadowed though by the lack of any way to make a collection without constantly spending money. The free modes give nothing. The competitive modes cost "tickets" which are just another form of currency. The idea that you can trade excess cards for tickets doesn't matter since cards can only be bought. There is no way to earn cards except to spend money, or hope that you win enough games using a ticket to earn one. This all comes down to, if you are the absolute best player, you'll win some packs, but any run in competitive playlists that isn't over 50% win rate means you lose your ticket, and get nothing back. The trade up of excess cards to tickets just does not equate to tickets because if you end up with enough excess cards, then you already had to spend money to get that many. I want this game to be more accessible to players that can't spend the hundreds of dollars required for a physical card game, but its not. I'd recommend taking your money elsewhere until they add some additional ways to play this game that doesn't require the wallet.
Before you want to buy this game:
1. Pros
-Good mechanics 
-Good image
-Deep lore 
-Acceptable sound and music
-Varrious strategies

2. Cons
- If you just pay 20 bucks to buy this game, better dont use ticket because they will match you with a person having ton of rare cards that can delete your game.
- basically have to pay money to collect cards, especially rare cards mean a lot of bucks
- no progression, no stats, if you dont spend more money if seems like a OFFLINE CARD game and LAN card game

Should you buy it or not? I guess the answer should be:
You should buy this game if:
-Money is not the matter with you
-Or you just want to relax yourself with casual mode after a losing streak in Dota 2

You should not buy this game if:
-You serious about a card game and dont have much money 
-You want something shows progression and other stuffs like that

To me, kind of disapointment.
Nowhere on the store page does it list that additional purchases will be necessary. Also, what purchases you will be required to make are extremely flawed in their concept. You have to pay for cards, pay to compete to earn cards, or buy card packs. No way to earn them without spending money. Most free to play games at least allow the opportunity to earn in game currency but this game with an initial $20 price tag does not. Pass until fixed…I requested a refund.
It seems to be a fun game so far, but I would like a currency system like League of Legends has, you know, the blue essence that you get when finishing a match, sure, you don't get that much, but you would be able to buy card packs in the shop if you play like 100 games, or like Armello does, giving you 3 free chests every single day of the week, and a free chest on login that you can either open it or sell it on the Market
sadly, this is the worst card game to get into no matter if casual or competitive gameplay. There are players that have already over 1000 hrs of experience in the game because they were granted alpha or beta access and it's impossible to catch up to them if you start playing now. Idk who thought it would be a good idea to give some players access months or even years before the official release putting everyone who didn't get into betas/alphas a huge disadvantage.

If you're just a casual gamer and might not care that others have miles of a head start it's even worse for you. The game offers no f2p progression and there is no other way than paying money to get more cards. This is a game for competitive players.
If you have been playing this game before the release then you are probably having a blast farming new players.
The gameplay is okay, if you enjoy card games with a lot of complexity then you'll probably enjoy that much. It is quite hard to learn how everything works, but it provides good methods of learning - viewing cards in detail and being able to hover over key words to see what they mean etc. It probably wouldn't take too long to feel pretty comfortable with this game.

Monetisation - The game costs money and then so do packs and tickets. It's certainly not a game for those looking to not spend money, especially as it progresses and more expensive cards are required to be able to compete well. 

The main reason I can't recommend this game right now though is in its current state it just feels unfinished. I have had freezes in my bot games, several crashes (and I was not able to continue my bot game upon starting the application again, a long game is just gone forever.) There's no way to spectate games. There's no ingame profiles or any way to view your previous games, let alone watch their replays. There is a weird into menu when you start the game which seems to serve no purpose, you just click a button to get into the real game menu.
Hopefully some of this stuff can be fixed so I could recommend this game to card game fans.
This game is boring, confusing, and hides the real cost of playing. I like the concept of a DotA 2 themed 3 board TCG but this was very poorly executed.
Looks like Valve cant even make a decent mini game anymore. They should just stop making games. Why would I want to play a time consuming card game that takes forever, when I can just play dota.

Cons:
- Pay-to-win aspect
- Random card matchups
- Limited deck control
- Inconsistent paths
- £15.99
- Takes getting used to, not your avarage gwent/hearthstone

Pros:
- Great illustrations
- Unique gameplay


Sooo... tutorial finishes. Oh this is a challenging interesting new take on a card gam.... Oh literally every card costs money. Can I create my own deck? Sure if you wanna spend money after forking 16 quid out on a card game when you have thronebreaker giving you a full campaign for 22 quid. I don't mean oh buy packs to help increase your chances of getting good cards I mean theres nothing. No daily rewards. No free packs for winning. Just what the ever loving hell game.
This game is really good, but what is sad is that its heavly cardpack based that you have to buy. And its mutch harder to grind free card like gwent og Heartstone. But if you look past that i will say this card game is mutch deeper and betterthen Heartstone. Even tho i like it, you shoud probly wait a bit too see if valve make it moore packs friendly.

Now i love it but when it comes down to consumer valvue, wait and see if valve do som good changes.




Hero has 3 status. Dmg, armor, HP and 1 skill, passive or active.
Stupid developers give str hero big dmg, great HP and some armor.
Stupid developers give agi hero big dmg too
Stupid developers give int hero nothing but shit
Stupid developers give no other way to get new cards but from buying bundle.
Not worth the money
Biggest scam
I gave it the benefit of the doubt. The fact that I literally play against 5 people with axe in a row tells me enough about this entire game. It's gonna be just as bad as hearthstone with top players making meta's and everybody copying it instead of creating their own decks. I bet more than half the people playing this game already looked up on google what the best decks are.
So much ridiculous variance from even from before you start the game. It's entirely possible to just straight up lose before the end of the first turn, and that means the most efficient way to play is to just keep surrendering after turn 1 until you get a hero placement that's favorable. Why they decided to bake so much RNG into this game is completely beyond me because the alternative to surrendering games where you don't have a favorable starting position is to dredge through an RNG slogfest where you're spending a very long time losing and if you start to creep towards a win, variance can instantly push you back into an unwinnable game state. It's like someone listened to Mark Rosewater talk about how slight variance can give people a chance that makes games intersting, and then implemented it backwards in that every game is a roll of the dice with a slight chance of the better player winning. Every single aspect of this game is randomly decided and as a long time competetive tabletop gamer across many systems including MtG, Android Netrunner, WH: Underworlds, YGH, and PKM. This game has absolutely zero competetive value or long term appeal, Please stay far away.
A shallow and very hackneyed card game that borrows from the multitude of other card games out on the market. For me, it'll remain an artifact buried in the ground!
Sadly enough a big fat NO!
The gameplay is decent too good except for the dozen ways the randomness can screw you over.
Basically Valve decides who wins and loses with all the randomness.
Games can be lost before even one swing is done...if your heroes are setup wrong at the start.And be assured they will.
 And if you need a minion too summon in one lane, be assured he won't.
Heroes? I only see weak blue ones in my packs.. you ll have to play a lot of basic heroes in draft and face better ones time and time again.
And those overloaded packs from the youtube and twitch streamers are just for them.
When you re gone open packs, be assured it ll be full of non playables.
All so you ll spend your cash a little faster...
The monetization of this game makes it very unappealing. You cannot earn anything ingame by just playing the game which makes you stuck with the initial cards you got from opening the packs. Would not recommend
Not able to report racists in game. As people can tell from my steam display name that I am a Chinese, a lot of times when I was about to win a match, opponents posted rude and racism messages via the customized emotes. I am not able to find a way to report these players in game. Usual trash talk is fine to me, but racism is a big no.

If you were not a Chinese, it could be very hard for you to imagine how many racial emotes and messages a Chinese-named player would get in Artifact, as well as in Dota 2, every day.

Given the recent racism incidents happened in Dota2 recently. I started wondering if being racists against Chinese is not something that Valve, or event broadly non-Chinese steam players, care about. If such racists are still free to post such messages and not get penaltized at all, I will not recommand this game to anyone that I know and I will not change this review.
Please make this game more dynamic and fun to play.

The concept itself is amazing, cards are interesting and heroes are very game-defining. The RNG though makes me want to kill myself sometimes.
Moreso than any other online card game, you can play perfectly and still lose. The game is filled with enough RNG and unfair abilities that losing is consistently frustrating while winning doesn't always feel like its because of your own skill.
I sold all item from this game because, stupid system and after i got less then 2 hours game play cant get back money, sold all all item from this game ,,250´´ craps from this game on market. Sry Valve this game is really sucks.
Played Hearthstone for over 3 years, loved it. Played some ES:Legends, loved that one even more (sadly that ones gets a bit too expensive). After 12h of playing Artifact I still have no idea what this game is trying to achieve. 

Gameplay and mechanics are pretty easy to understand but the game itself gets incredibly frustrating and unintuitive. The UI makes no sense, the navigation is pretty broken and the game itself is more annoying than fun. Aside from some balance issues, the whole "random positions/random attackers" thing makes absolutely no sense and completely ruins the experience.
Great game if you enjoy cardgames. 
Unfortunally, there's no progression as in a ladder atm, which Im some-what okay with. 
Knowing how to walk is usually a good idea if you want to climb.

Edit: They pushed out a smaller update a few weeks ago that did very little for this game. It's unfortunate, but I'm starting to get the feel that Valve is about to abandon this game. DON'T BUY!
Far too heavy on the rng. Random minon placement and attack direction, random shop items and 50% to win the game / lose the game card effects dilute player skill.
You can't get new cards in this game. Don't buy it. After you open the first 10 packs you are left with nothing but them. Donation is the only way to get card packs.
PAY TO WIN!-PAY TO PLAY!-PAY TO EARN-PAY TO LOSE.
im 24 and in my entire life ive been playing video games.I never seen a video game as bad as this 1.
so you pay 18$ to play the game.you get 10 packs with that price that is just HORIBLE.if you get shit heroes your just fkt you will forever lose.there is no other way to earn packs without paying.Even if you win you get NOTHING.

There is a mode that you have to win 5 games and you get only 2 lifes as i call them.if you lose 2 times no mather your progress you lost that makes it almost imposible to win that. And i  dont even know if it gives rewards if you win .they dont say anything about that.But you cant win remember that .if you get the worst heroes in those starting packs.

EA should look at this game and take notes.the amount of monetization this 1 game has is just incredible .EA is just a little boy compared to what valve has done.

Now lets talk about gameplay a bit .
The games takes way to long .its like 25 min+do you imagine how much time you need to win 5 games.....
Every game you just wish you dont get that 1 guy who takes 2 mins to click that FKING COIN EVEN WHEN THEY HAVE NO MOVES LEFT...
I played the game and got matched against a random player.He won that game just because he had better cards.There is no skill involved when you can buy better cards and win games,,,,

I would not recommand this game at all .Not even to my enemiess.srsly.If you have the habbit to use your money on useless shit.just try to wipe your ass with them or make airplanes and trow it from the top of a building.becauase that way you wont regret as much.

Hearthstone
-you play for free
-you have acces to all modes for free
-if you decide not to invest money you can still earn packs.
-skills >money(you can still win with low cost decks)
-HAS PROGRESS(GOLD) and quests.
Artifact
-pay to play (18$ on steam)
-pay to win(better cards-better stats-easy win)there is a card that destroys the lane .idk the name but that guy had it and because of that 1 single card i lost the game.even when he had only 5 hp.i dont have that but i wish i would...
-pay to earn
pay for tickets to earn more rewards .but even so your still going to lose.WHY?BECAUSE THERE ARE PLAYERS WHO PLAYED THIS GAME BEFORE ALL OF YOU.so they have that advanced agianst you.
-pay to lose
If youre an idiot like me and payed around 9$ for 5 packs and still get shit all when the game went live.well..keep in mind there are people who payed 100$+ 
-THE ONLY PROGRESS THIS GAME HAS IS YOUR WALLET.
if you lose or win you still get nothing!
For 20 $ its like looking at a wall for 40 mins each gameplay .you get nothing!
its the most useless game ever! 0 satisfaction.a time waist .doing 1 push up every 24 hours is more rewarding that playing this game for 1 hour.
holy monetization, batman. it's like MTGO but somehow worse. everything is dollars, there is no way to earn cards in game, aside from doing really well in a gauntlet.
The presentation of the game is lovely but the gameplay is way too complicated in teh begginner stages to hook me, the matches take too long and with that said I'd rather play a game of dota than a match of artifact. 
One of the biggest reasons for me buying it was the lore bits which in the hour or so I played were great, all items have lines and the game looks like out of the DOTA universe but I can't get over how hard it is to play. I'm sure it will be getting better with time until then I'm getting a refund and spending my time in something else.
I had no issue with the monetization, I like how there are featured matches with preconstructed decks and a focus on card drafting rather than in constructed play.
Try it, if its your thing, keep it. Play something else otherwise.
Oh also I thought it would'nt have hearthstone levels of RNG but it does, sadly.
The game is extremely complex, if not the most complex among all digital card games, targeting mainly hardcore card gamers. An average game is about 30 minutes which can be mentally exhausting since there is no downtime in a match. There is a lot to think which is great but might be a turn off for casuals who want to just relax.  However, the real biggest downside is constructed is P2W (marketplace sells power, some cards are apparently better than others and there is no way you can earn cards by playing.) Unless you are only draft player or willing to pay the price of an AAA title for a single deck, you will have a very bad time. IMHO It's safe to skip Artifact as there are many good CCGs that provide great experiences and are more wallet-friendly.
playing artifact made me realise I just wanted to play mtg arena
so now I just play mtg arena

thanks artifact!

feb19 update: valve were nice enough to refund artifact

this game is garbage 
from a toilet
Although the production values are quite high and the game will eventually reward knowledge with victory, the actual process of playing Artifact is not pleasurable enough to offset the volume of work required to develop basic mastery.

Ultimately, Prismata is better for the hardcore seeking a meritocracy, and Magic Arena is better for the more casual seeking a fun card game in which to grow and improve. All of the above have less fiddly controls and weird randomness than Artifact.
I'll start by saying I had high hopes for this game. Not expectations or hype, just hopes. I can honestly say I love all Valve's previously released full games and card games in general but this was an extreme disappointment.

First off, the economic plan Valve's decided on here is beyond greedy. You pay for the game and then you have to pay to get more cards (not any real way of earning cards without paying) and you actually have to pay to keep playing the real competitive modes. Looking at Hearthstone there's at least the possibility of earning in game currency and buying your way into a draft; in Artifact you have to whip out the ol' money bag.

And if you actually decide to put in money to play the drafts you'll end up playing a horribly unbalanced game, where even if you get all the best cards and play perfectly, you could still end up losing if the RNG decides it and your opponent isn't braindead. That's how much of a random factor this game has and that's not counting the standard card drawing. 

I'm extremely disheartened by how game developers decide what their game should look like nowadays, I don't know why I maybe thought Valve would be different.

I paid for the game but I regret it and won't put in another dime unless something changes drastically.

Don't condone this disgusting behavior from developers and publishers.
Tried it, didn't like it.

The idea of buffing big minions constantly sounds fun in theory, but in practice you're either betting on ability to destroy hero or just enemy leaving the lane in frustration and hoping to end game by battling other lane.

I think Elder Scrolls legends does this multiple lanes better. The idea of having multiple resources Is good but you end up having very boring items in the shop to purchase. I ended up multiple rounds with pretty much same items in the shop.

I think the Hearthstone like single unit attacking chosen target would make game more interesting on strategic point or allowing the hero to swap target by moving left or right once.

Also why is my unit always blocked from attacking tower because of minion spawns in front?

Game just started too messy and too complex set of rules for someone to just jump into the game, and many things just seem out of your control.
Edit:

What initially looked like a reasonably clever monetisation system has completely fallen flat as Valve has failed to update pack prices to match falling market prices.

Additionally, it's come to my attention that the "Prize Play" modes use MMR to match players against equal opponents. This together with a 2-loss defeat, with 3 wins to break even mean that every player, no matter how good or bad, is going to lose in game currency on average. Nobody is "going infinite" in this game. There is nothing to aspire to.

With no reasonable motive to play Prize Play, which is clearly supposed to be the main format, there isn't a lot to be excited about. The lacklustre card design makes constructed modes unplayable and the preconstructed mode gets old pretty fast. The game has so many formats, but only the free draft mode (that almost didn't launch with the game) is remotely interesting at this point, but even that is tainted by bad card design and with only a slapdash token grindy progression system, it just feels bad.

I'm still hopeful that things will change significantly and revitalise what could have been a great game, but I can't recommend buying it at this stage.

Original review

Well, the business model is kind of predatory and at first glance, totally reprehensible, but I was surprised to find that if one looks a little deeper, it's predatory in a way that's a lot more rewarding for long term players than other card game business models.

Essentially, it seems that the people who get robbed in Artifact are the same people who get robbed in other card games: people who don't have the patience to grind a full collection and prefer to throw money at the problem. The big difference is that by participating in the game and providing opposition for these people, the grinders who might F2P in other games actually earn a large fraction of what's spent on those cards, similar to how you can earn cosmetics in DotA 2 and reliably sell them for a profit to people who don't participate in the events.

Basically, even if you immediately retire your keeper drafts and don't get any in game currency rewards (packs and draft tickets), the market value of the contents are going to be roughly equal to the cost of buying the currency. The "going infinite" possibility is just a bonus reward for playing the games.

So, I was extremely sceptical of the business model at first and of course it's a pity that so many people like to throw money at stuff that won't really get them anywhere and a pity to take advantage of that, but I think it's probably not actually as bad as other card games in that respect, crazy as it may sound. It seems that Valve wants people to play the game so that some of those people will spend a lot of money and is prepared to basically employ the other people to keep up their participation in the game, so that the money keeps on flowing.

The game itself is a lot of fun. My games so far have probably lasted about an hour on average, so it can be a lot more emotionally engaging than shorter session card games. Even more than Dota 2, imo. Maybe the fact I'm fighting for real Steam Dollars adds to the suspense, but possibly the length and nature of the game contribute more to making it so involving. I've found myself jumping for joy more than once when the "WIN" button has revealed itself at the end of a long game. It also has enough randomness that you don't feel like a failure when you lose, so in my experience so far, it offers a very positive experience on the whole.

My biggest gripe with it is actually that a lot of the card designs seem really awful and unbalanced, but at least for the moment, the rarity balance and popular metagame choices in draft mode aren't anywhere near as obnoxious as they could be, so it doesn't come up very often. I'd definately give the game about a 2/10 for card design, but the core gameplay is so good that the card shortcomings can kind of be ignored. That's right, "6 mana condemn all units", I'm kind of ignoring you, but also kind of wishing you didn't exist. Maybe Valve will ramp up and condemn all of their terrible blowout swing cards, but I kind of doubt it.

I think in the long term, people will probably realise that they're not judging the business model fairly, relative to its competition, at least, but the lazy card design is always going to haunt the game and I think that's probably why even pro players aren't excited about the constructed mode, where all of the dregs can be collected together. So, the game certainly has problems and obstacles to overcome, but even if nothing changes, there's a lot of fun to be had, so I recommend.
This game needs a replay system badly, if i make a mistake in-game or my opponent makes a excellent play that i want to see  againor share with friends i can't revisit  those moment that. I can download any steam program to rewatch my games but this is from the makers of DOTA 2, they have a replay for DOTA 2 and it should be in artifact as well. The game is great but for me its missing this key feature to help players improve and get better.
Although I really like this game's style, the lack of "progression" lack of grindable/free packs makes it a little disappointing. I understand it might be great for others, but it's not great for me. Shame, I was very hyped for this.
The game is a rip off no way to play arena or get tickets or free cards so you actualy have to pay to play any of the remotly fun game modes. The free to play modes one is construceted which is Pay 2 win in if you have better cards you will just win its that simple. The balance in the game is hot garbage Meepo is beyond trash it hurts RNG is actually fucking rediculous in this game the only way a blue deck can win or lose is if a rolls well on rng I have actualy lost 4 won games due to eclipes rolling absolute bullshi i.e hitting heros in two seprate lanes rather than the creeeps of which there was tree or more in nice...
Another problem is the fucking time people have to take there turns is far too long its mental you sit there waiting like a fucking lemon because your oppent is taking forever to make a move, the timer needs to be reduced its baffling that it is this long (the game may be complicated but if i wanted to spend 10 mins waiting for somthing to happen i would go watch paint dry but even that is probably quicker, games can last over an hour which is just insane when the limiting factor is turn time it needs to be reduced it adds to the skill of the player if they can make there turn quicker and makes it more competative. it actaully makes the game very boring as you wait for so long if your oppent is slow.

Music in the game is repatitve as well the same song on loop no varriation baffling to say the least, muted it after 3 hours now listining to youtube instead.

For a £15 base game you dont get your moneys worth unless you open packs get lucky and sell them for a free game you are better off playing Magic the gathering arena its the same, there is nothing revolutionaly here its a bog standard card game with balance issues a lot of them RNg issues there is just way too much, spells defo need to be less rng its stupid that 1 card can win u a game just because it rolls well if you have missplayed and are loosing badly that is jsut shit game design. the F2p game modes only 1 of them is worth playing as the others are based on cards you own so unless you sink £300 into the game for all the cards you will always lose to people who have paid for the stronger cards as they are just way better again balanced problems....
The game is just not fun. 
It is designed to have a lot of strategy involved. But does so at the cost of the fun you could have.

For exemple : 
To play a blue card you need a hero with the same color on the board. That involve a lot of thinking ahead. But you just ends up in a situation where you could pull of a really cool combo and you just can't because you don't have all the required colors on heroes. You needed them elsewhere. That's not fun.

But it goes way beyond that because of initiative.
The way the game work is like this : you have initiative you can play a card but if you do so the opponent will get initiative.
And you have 3 boards.

Exemple :
You have this really cool combo you could do. But you're not gonna do it to keep your initiative on the second board because you know if you don't he will kill your hero and you won't be able to play a card.
So you play nothing istead of a cool combo just so you can use a stupid "kill hero" card. Then the enemy surely had a cool card for the situation but can't play it because he has no heroes anymore. But hey you thinked ahead of him and kept your initiative. Does this feel rewarding ? Not at all. You know it's the better play but you're still sad you had to give up on your combo. 
And I say combo because i'm used to playing card game but in this game you can't even combo 2 cards because after the first one you give initiative so the opponent will play something to fuck your combo. Yeah more fun ruining


I'm kinda sad to not reccommend this game. I've loved valve and their games and despite all the critisism the game received I still though it was going to be good. I had to much trust in them. I really wanted something new in cards game. I've played magic, hearthstone, gwent, and other less known cards game with more strategy involved. They all had goods and bad. I though Richard Garfield with all his experience could do something really good with Valve. I was wrong. 
I mean the worst thing in magic is when you don't draw any land or only one color when you play 2 or more. And you can't play any cards. 
And here you still have this shit where you don't have initiative so you get your hero killed so you can't play any cards. 
If only someone could design and balance a game where you can actually choose whether you want mana or spells. But that's another story I guess. 

Also the music sucks and is repetitive and that's so bad for a video game.
Give my money back, i don't give a shit about steam policy and other crap you say. This game was born dead and there is no reason to play it more than needed to get cards, which partly gives my money back. Better play hearthstone for free.
Shitty Card Game, that's all you need to know.
Get Hearthstone instead if you're looking for this kind of game.

Valve, please get back to making games people actually care about.
This game is very fun.

But that's not enough.
This game is riddled with microtransactions, but thats not the problem with it.

The problem is purpose.

There is literally no reason to play this game. You get nothing. Theres nothing to strive for or to achieve. The only thing to do in this game is to just play the game. And if $20 isn't enough, there isn't even a way to get free card packs.

There are no goals in this game, nothing really meaningful. It feels like some kind of online card game,  but really its just a "game" where you pay $20 just for the ability to pay more money so you feel like you're getting the most out of your original $20. The only rewarding thing in this game is the "win streaks" which get you NOTHING. There is the ranked type mode, which does gift you packs, BUT YOU NEED TO BUY TICKETS TO PLAY IT

Unless you're willing to put money into a game with no goals and no purpose and no actual incentive to win or play at all, DON'T BUY THIS.

But like I said it's very fun, but that's not enough. This is a pure cash grab. Just you wait, the hats will be added soon enough.
Spent money for this game then need to spent another money to BUY CARDS.

WIN THIS GAME NOT IMPORTANT.
YOU WON'T GET SOMETHING EVEN YOU WIN 10 TIMES A ROW

1/10
Has promise but as of right now I can't recommend it with the lack of progression and how slow it feels. It gets boring running the same decks after a bit which makes you have to spend money on packs. Not a big fan.
This game is hot garbage, out of the 15 games ive played, i won only a single one. It is not because I am bad and choose the wrong plays, its 90% of the time because the enemy has straight up better cards that they paid for, ive seen two decks only that run rampant to just stomp every game. Since i didnt buy any cards im stuck with the basic and just cant win with it.
First things first. It's a good game. While it has also flaws in its core mechanics, overall it's fun. About once a week I log in and play a game or two.

BUT: Monetization is horrible. It's NOT a TCG. You can't trade, but only buy/sell directly. There are no costs for retailer or physical production of cards, yet it's still expensive. Yes, compared to other card games it's on the cheaper side, but there is no way to get cards besides paying. This is the biggest problem.

People who primarily play this game might be fine with the overall cost. But casual gamers don't get the opportunity to get into the game at their own pace. 

I play Magic:Arena and Hearthstone casually as F2P. It's great to jump into these games, do some matches to earn cards/gold and than with that gold do arena/draft and FIGHT for something. Rushes of adrenaline because there is something at stake. And slowly with gathering more and more cards you build different kind of decks with cards you have.

Artifact basically tells you: Check some meta decks and buy those cards directly. Casual gamers won't ever find a way to do any kind of deck building. Also the free draft mode in Artifact is to some extend just a draft simulation because people don't really care if they win or lose. And why should they. There is nothing to win or lose.

I knew all these problems very early at a point at which I could've refund Artifact. But I still got my hopes up for it to some degree. And if it won't get better there is at least those 1-2 games a week I can find some enjoyment with.


EDIT: Now there are rewards you can get with leveling up. This is a huge step forward. I'm not sure how significant 15 packs and some tickets are for a whole season but it's better than nothing.

In addition the more I play the more it bothers me how long games take. Maybe it's just me but this game feels way more exhausting than any other card game I ever played.

While the monetization model is improveing and Valve is willing to make balance changes, I don't know how much will change in regards of lenght of games. If in the end this will be my only problem with the game I will recommend it as not everyone is bothered by those long games.
Artifact attempts to captivate its audience rediculously complicated mechanics in order for it to stand out from the other card games but instead confuse and turn away both casual and devoted players alike. The majority of the content (Cards/Skins) are locked away a wall of microtransactions. Features such as these are expected if the game is Free to Play, much like its competitors. But playing over $20 for the privelage of purchasing further is a bad move.

There are things that are redeemable about the game. The art style is very well put together, hovever, the design of the cards themselves are quite difficult to understand even after playing the tutorial. This goes back to the point that the game is over complicated as there is no room for all of the rules to fit on a single card.

Overall I do not recommend this game in its current state. Make the base game free and fix some issues with the overlay and the game may be worth playing

5/10
I dont recomend you spending any money on this game. Buy it if you want to play draft. Otherwise, just stay way. The monetization on this game is just terrible.
I dont have enough luck for this game's fuking RNG. and you must have enough money for build a full deck to play with non-newibie player that ready to rekt u every single games.  dont think about free packs cause 1 level have 1000 exp and when you play with that fucking poor deck if u lose u will get about 10 exp only.

have fun for who wanna buy this :)
Wouldn't really recommend this game unless you have 3 hours to spend on 1 match, but the cards i unpacked paid for the game itself so not complaining much
I do not enjoy this game. How can I win this game without good cards? No, the results are same. Losing always happenned to me. Especially when I play constructed draft, I lost many times without reward or anything to drive me to play this game continuously. I am so nevours for considering to play this game along or rather not play this game anymore. It is so painful.

This game is not a good game, not yet a good competitive game. Imbalanced heroes. Better cards always overwhelm the game. No chance to win the overwhelming opponent. Deeply-strategic is a lie. It's just destroying tower by the specify methods of your specified-colored owned deck as fast as possible. And a bad thing I found is Green card. How pathetic, you can not play with only-green deck, it is designed for being supporter, nor a good attacker and a good defender, just being aura-holder creeps. Comparing with only red or blue or black deck, it cannot overwhelm any lane in every rounds.

If you want to play game for fun, please do not buy this game now. It only makes you mad. Only credit card with a lot of money can win the opponent.
Pay 2 Play then Pay some more, the numbers just dont add up whichever way you go constructed or  phantom, keeper draft all = negative ev on anything under 80% w/l ratio and even if you get the perfect 5-0's the time investment for each 5 run is not worth the ev
Disappointment :

First let me say I have played MTGO, Duels Planeswalkers, Arena, Hearthstone, etc. (I like card games !!)

Also I love left 4 dead, TF2, etc. (a fan of Valve)

That all being known I should have wonderful things to say, ....... Artifact is a PAY TO PLAY game, and Gabe should be ashamed.

This game could have been something special but like every other game anymore it is ruined by greed

In no capacity can you grind or work towards gaining cards, Immediately the game warns you that you can't get a refund and it is apparent to get into this game you must first open your wallet up for a random chance at getting a set of cards.

DO NOT BUY ; NO REFUNDS ; Better options exist that won't leave you wondering where $400 went when you're just trying to play a game

Valve has lost soo much trust with me, they've shown they're no better than other companies when it comes to filthy money practices.
Valve is trying to apply an established real world TCG monetization model to a virtual card game where they take a cut out of every trade made which in turn promotes market manipulation and they don't have any incentive to fix it. Playing meta decks that you see in tournaments right now will cost you 4-5 times the price of the game and the price is only going up. 

Draft is good though.
Extremely luck based game. Designed for people who enjoy deciding outcomes by rolling dice apparently.

No mulligans, random creep lane spawns, random spawn positions in lanes, attack arrows, secret shop, TP scrolls, lack of consistent card draw, bad card / hero power balance...make games (especially close ones) feel decided by luck rather than skill.
RNG beyond card draw is absolutely fatal to the higher strategy I typically enjoy in complex card games. This game seems to rely on RNG (other than card draw) at its core, which already had me doubtful I could continue investing time into this game.

I decided I could not continue investing into this game when I realized the only way to progress within the game is to continue paying for it. There is almost no reward as an incentive to play with starting materials.

I may come back to this game if the situation improves, but as it stands now, greed and embedded RNG bog down a game that has good potential.
The fact that it was available for SO MANY PEOPLE before launch and still you release an update few weeks after launch which nerfed several cards I paid MONEY TO GET is awful. I understand the need of balancing the cards constantly, but not when this game offers the posibility to buy individual cards from the market. I mean I paid for cheating death to give me 50% chances to save ALL my troops from the lane not just one (if I have the initiative). Now there's not even a point to have it in the deck. Instead you left TOT as it was, which is the most broken single card in the game. 

The fact that you can have at least 3x7 mana cards in the starting draw (just because you have PA for example in your deck) is again pathetic. Just follow Heartsone's example and let us redraw the first cards if we want to. I've been so many times stuck for 2 rounds with no cards to play... (for those who don't know, you start with 3 mana and add 1 each round)

The hero placing at the beginning of the game is also terrible. I mean if I'm playing blue+green the game makes sure to find an opponent who plays black/red and my heroes will be spawned in front of theirs just to make sure I will lose 3 heroes in the 1st round :). 

The easiest feature to implement has been left for patch. How hard was it to have in day 1 stats of the wins/played games??? 

On the plus side, I like the design, the game itself is easy to understand and master. There are no two identical matches because of the multitude of cards and item combinations and the randomness of creep spawns. The artists have done an amazing job and I salute the developers for a (so far) bug-free experience. It is pretty hard at a first glance to learn to manage your cards+items when you play on 3 different "lanes", but a few hours in the game will help you. However, even early in the match, making a single mistake may give you 0 chance to win. On the plus side, the matches are short (with an average of 20 minutes). 

I wouldn't recommend the game though. It's incredibly frustrating. Although it's a Premium game, it's clearly a pay to win, since no one is lucky enough to get all the buffed heroes, cards and items in the free packs. And right after you pay for them, here comes an updated to make sure that you've thrown the money out the window. I mean I know everyone is releasing games only to make money these days, but the greed has reached new levels with Valve.
This is a bad game.  It is incredibly unbalanced.  If your deck is built around armor(which is permenant btw even after death) you are pretty much going to win (not a good sign of a well designed game).  Also some effect persist after death both negative and positive.  This game is based on DOTA 2 which doesnt have these kind of mechanics.  Speaking of which, why in a game (which again this artifact is based on) where positioning is very important, is it not in this game.  You should be able to choose where on a lane your hero will spawn.  There is too much luck involved in this game for it to be a good game.  I understand that certain types of decks counter certain types of deck, but in well balanced games you can still win if you have a good strategy and play your cards well.  However, here unless you get very lucky or your opponent doesnt know what they are doing  you have no chance to win (again not a good sign of a well designed game).
Paid 20 dollars to get 2 starting decks and 5 tickets for "expert play". 
The only way to get packs is to buy them at 2 dollars each ;)
Seems quite p2w, let's see if valve changes anything relating microtransactions
Edit: Sold all the expensive cards that i've received in those 10 card packs and got back 10 bucks, but that doesn't change anything
After more than two hours of waiting and a server connection issue, I still didin't received my card packs. A multi-million dollar company can't make a proper release. This is the new norm I guess. Indie studios work more and better than fat companies. I asked for a refund.
Absolutely worst unbalanced game ever. That's complete bullshit. Some cards allow the player to play like 30 mana in one turn and you can't play nothing. That's not fun, that's pure shit. Pathetic as fuck, all the card are just for pay. just pass this poor game
Trash game that I payed 18 euros for, but got 32 back from selling away the rare cards from the starter packs.
Too bad steam doesn't allow you to refund it after selling those away :3c
This game is fucking garbage, its a pure PAY TO WIN game, basically if you run out of ticket, you have to pay to get more, and obviously the only and main goal is the ranked games, because the casual mode is just retarded people surrender at round 3 every time.
The draft mode is a complete joke, the gameplay is a complete joke aswell, completly based on RNG, even more than hearthstone, and the best part is you have to pay for it.

DONT BUY THIS CRAP
over-hyped game day 1 really long queue times  extremely log matches  that become RNG fest no matter how well you play rng can ruin your game. 2 of my friends are selling all their cards trying to get whatever steam wallet out of the initial market inflation but in 2-3 days most if not all cards will be worthless. Play it if you dont care to spend 150$ on a dead on arrival TCG.
Terrible.

Played through the 2 tutorial fights, have no fucking clue whats happening. The heroes I draft (random cos tutorial), don't support the cards I draft, so can't play them. Took tower damage on the first turn, until the end.

I suspect to get a full deck of playable cards (noting the shite I got during the tutorial) you'd need to have the strongest card - Your Credit Card.

Now, where do I go for that refund.
The card system itself is fun. But it's too hard for non-MTG experienced players and for f2p(open packs) players.

The matching system makes new joiner meets progressed player. And the game is losing player.

Not recommend if you're not both a hardcore TCG player and a dota2 player, who can invest quite some money to buy cards.
Propably the most horrible card game I've ever played. This one is 50% pay to win and 50% luck. There is no skill anywhere between. Just pure awful all the way to alt + f4.
Honestly, compared to some other CCGs it just isn't that fun.

The matches are too long and there are a few RNG elements beyond just drawing cards from a deck that come into play.

Half of your decks are going to be built around combatting the RNG inherent in the mechanics, and I just don't find that playstyle very fun. I'd rather be playing against my opponent.

I really don't think this game benefits from being in a digital format at all.
Pure and utter trash, rng-ridden, frustration-loaded.

Worst Digital Card Games of the century all things considered.

For whales and dimwitted consumers mayhaps, that colourful nightmare might do.
I'm not even joshing with you when I say I think Valve knew this game wasn't working out and they just released it to recoup some of the money they spent on producing it.
I will not go into the same "buy cards for real money in a game that you have already bought with money" stuff.

My problem is that in the current state Artifact lacks any sort of progression whatsoever.
Gameplay would turn into pointless time-killer after 3rd of 4th game.
I dont mind buying anything or the cards, however i do feel as though my time is wasted without a progession/reward system. I do enjoy playing Expert play but I do not enjoy spending all my time in that with little rewards. This game needs a progression system in order to keep its players
It's a good game but it has no soul, sold my cards and got the money back almost to the price of the game and uninstalled.


so it could have been worse.
Wow this game is bad, I mean pay to win aside the design and gameplay are the worst.

First you have 3 lanes, there is no reason to have 3 lanes other then they function as 3 diffrent games.  Why would you play 3 diffrent games at the same time you ask, well one game would be so boring that this game would classified as a sleep aide.

Then we have the shop phase, totally worthless other then to make the player that has a better collection and is ahead more  ahead.

O we have that imp that annoys you the whole game....


if you are here looking for online keyforge like good ness, go play duelyst for free and do not waste your time here or play keyforge online https://www.thecrucible.online/

it is hard to fathom how a game this bad gets released next to a game that is so good.

I mean if you hate your self and have money to spend and will not send it to me I guess you can play this game... sure
Well its a fun game, only sad part is every fight you have vs players is more or less the same cards do to pay to win. most of the cards are cheap but it kinda takes the fun out of a nice game with a new look at MTG themed card game. so far I can not see any way to grind new cards and I don´t wana pay money to get cards so if you are a cassual player when no money this is not a game for you since all you meet even in cassuel is people who have used lots of money to get the same deck as every one els.
I wouldn't recommend this game, I didn't enjoy it a one bit, I really tried liking it though, but the aspect of having to buy cards wasn't something I liked.

Now we'll see if Valve refunds games that are created by them, might be harder to give up that money now.

ALERT STOP!
If you buy this game, do not open the free packs you get, this is a gimmick valve uses so they have a clause to not refund you this game. So you get 10 free packs of cards when you start the game if you open those, you are not going to get a refund.

How was I to know that THOSE cards were going to make my refund appeal moot.
too much pay 2 win
some cards imbalanced some complete garbage
if u didnt get any good cards almost impossible to get good ones.
and the fact you open your packs makes it impossible to refund... so dumb
Complete waste of my time.  Light on instruction, slow,  and boring.  I certainly see why they did not want to set up a demo as they would have no sales.  Would take a refund on this one if it was allowed. Incredibly dissapointed.
I was actually disappointed with the game. Came in with an open mind, first time playing a card game like this, not sure what I was supposed to be expecting. Blown away with steam support. Thinking the starter packs were tied into the tutorial, I’ve opened “in-game consumables” and therefore am not eligible for a refund. Thanks for keeping the $20, otherwise I would have fallen into another P2W.
Horrible monetization, awfully slow gameplay, clunky mechanics. It's just not as good as the other games of the genre.

Sorry Mr. Garfiled, I'll stick with your Original.
valve im sorry. i waited but no i think its a no go. with dota racking multi-million dollar championships and cs go going free2play annnnnd halflife3 getting 5 star reviews without it actually existing i think we deserve our money back . if you bring this game back to life we would gladly buy it again, it could be cool, it could be awesome but this what your doing right now is bad , its the type of ea/sony xbox move.
Wouldn't give me a refund. I played a handful of games but accidentally left the game open overnight so they decided since my 'playtime' was over two hours i wasn't getting a refund, despite not having claimed the starter packs. Would they have done this were the game ultra successful? I don't think so. Moreover, why try to replicate physical TCG transaction mechanics in a purely digital environment? All signs point to money grab; I won't ever support this product or this company every again until they acknowledge the con they they pulled on us.
Garbage game, maybe it can be fixed, the RNG levels are just way too damn high.  RNG is fine in card games to an extent, but this game takes it way too far.  Unless the game goes late, which is rare, your match is 80% decided on RNG and pay-to-win mechanics, and even when games go late they are still 50% decided by RNG.  This has to be the worst card game design I have ever seen - the idea behind it is great, maybe if they removed some of the RNG and let lane placement be something you control, or hero placement.  Right now the game is a dumpster-fire and I don't think they will ever change it
Just dont 
Unless u have like 150$ to buy all the op cards and to buy tournament tickets etc.
or wait for the card prices to drop to less than a $ each or something
Not worth the money. imagine having to pay the creators of magic or yugioh just to pay for packs to play there game. Can't really recommend this until they fix some more problems.
Honestly a terrible card game, i wish i didnt commit so much money to this game :(. There is only a couple of good decks which require a fair bit of outlay, if you dont have those decks and you come up against them its an auto lose. Pay to win
Do not buy this game yet, it is uncompleted and lacks a multitude of features such as in game communication, spectating and replays. The balance feels very off and the random nature is very choatic.

The game can be enjoyed for the choatic nature of the RNG and more so in drafting.

I strongly advise against playing this game if you are a player who wants to be in control of their games. There are better alternatives out there.


This game just came out a couple of hours ago. I have played LOL and Magic and I can say this feels more like Magic. I like Magic so I like this game. I have only played for a couple of hours but I know I can play many more. Don’t read into all the hate. This is a solid card game.

Ok I'm now at around 15 hours. I can see why there is so much hate. There isn’t a way to play with the starting 20$. You have to put money into the game to buy cards. Now at the moment this is going to make all the people that thought they could play with just the 20$ mad. You don’t find this out until you pass the tutorial, however, the makes of the game made it so you can’t return the game once you pass this tutorial. Now I don’t know this but they are probably going to change this pay to win but that is only going to make all the people that put more money into the game past the 20$ mad. So, this leaves the fact that they on purpose released a game just to make money on an unethical game progression. This being said its still a fun game, but I feel like you have to “dump” a LOT of money to make it playable.
Random spawn. Random arrows. Random shop.
You can win here only if you have a lot of Luck. No matter what kind of decks do you use.
You can lose in the second round if all your heroes are in dead way and the enemy has "PAY DAY" x3
If you aren't agree with me, then you are more luckier than me.
[h1] TLDR [/h1]

Walking in EA's footsteps, progression in this game is blocked by your wallet.
This game is unbalanced but the worst is that Valve have setup themselves with no incentive to balance it.
If only this was an LCG with golden/foil card packs. 

[h1] My take on it [/h1]

This is a really nice card game on concept alone!
Unfortunately, for the tactical card game I feel it promoted itself as, it feels so unbalanced.

It is impossible to play constructed [u]at the top of your game[/u] without the current 2-3 meta decks. Those decks only contain the most expensive cards on the market.
The power distribution of cards make half of the card pool useless, unless it's draft. This is [u]only because of rarity[/u].
Powerful cards will always be expensive because they are "rare" and they will never remove rarity because it adds a ceiling on per customer spending.
Also the fact that there is "rarity" Valve has no incentive on really balancing cards out.
You might argue that this is only the first set and it will be balanced with others coming in. Under the assumption of no real balancing, the baseline power will be defined by Drow and Axe and the next set will maybe bring 3-4 meta decks instead of the current 2-3. The concept of "rarity" and "draft" together will make this game having the same problem of 50% useless cards.
Also, if you notice that a card bringing any consistent advantage, you can bet it's rare, and constructed wants to max consistency for their playstyle.  

This realisation left me with only disappointment to be honest. I stopped playing real life Magic for these exact same reasons.
This is a high-quality graphics game with great game mechanism but it's really depends on what cards you have.
If you want to enjoy this game, yeah, there is one way -- topping up for new card packs!
Otherwise there is only one consequence, being defeated,, again and again (thousands of times). 
Only 'buying this game' is far away from enough, you might need to spend much more money on it so that you could enjoy it after all!


Artifact is a nice game and is better than Hearthstone in plenty of ways but I can't win any matches because of those FUCKING BLACK DECKS AND THEIR FUCKING COWARDLY BULLSHIT WITH STALLING AND MONEY AND WINE AND CHEAP FUCKING TACTICS! I'M A BASIC RED/GREEN DECK WANTING TO HAVE FUN! AND ALL I DO IS LOSE TO THESE FUCKING LOSERS PLAYING ON BABY MODE WITH THEIR EASY TO WIN DECKS! If you play any deck with a black hero in it, just fucking uninstall the game and get a life. Maybe play something easy to win that won't piss people off too while you're at it. I WOULD RATHER PLAY HEARTHSTONE THAN THIS GAME IF ALL THAT EVER HAPPENS IS THAT I LOSE TO THESE PATHETIC BLACK DECKS! AND IF YOU ADD BLUE YOU ARE THE MOST LOWLY PERSON TO EVER EXIST! I'm sure you're failing miserably in life if you play Black/Blue.
Wrost game ever 
intersting game play but WASTE U TIME 
1 turn play 2-5min 3 line = 6min- 15min per turn
1 match 5-10 turn = 30-150min per match 
NOT RECOMMENDED 
NOT FUN GAME
the economy is bad, the game is long AND tedious. Game has no in-game currency that I can accumulate, I can't trade with other people, AND lost a part of my collection if I were to sell them in market ?
Boring game play, only to be topped off, with the game being actually unplayable. When building a deck, i drag and drop my first card in, then when i do the same with a second card the whole game freezes and becomes unresponsive. Only way to exit game is ctrl-alt-delte. So then after applying for refund. I've played 67 minutes, i get told sorry you cant have one as you have opened the call to arms packs which it tells you to open. Really fucking dodgy i would say. Valve please see this and sort it out
Steam won't refund me although I don't like this trash game. They won't refund the game if you opened the 5 packs they give you in the beggining so before buying the game, make sure you really like it because Steam will steal and run away with your money.
horrible game, terrible p2w system made for whales, sure you can play casual draft free forever, but who wants to sink in their time for ZERO reward? you cant even refund the game EVEN if you have less than 2 hours played because of their clever trick that they put in, when you finish the tutorial and open the "free" welcoming packs you throw out your rights to refund the game LMAO how smart is that?? why isnt every game doing this? just give something for free once you open the game and then deny everyone refunds HILARIOUS. Stay away from this garbage.
You buy the game, you buy the cards, then you have to buy more to play. Too bad, because the game is actually fun. Don't waste your money though, it'll be dead in a month.
A good idea that came up short. Artifact has the potential to be a decent or better game, but in its current state it is rather dismal in comparison to its competitors. The 3 lane system is a nice riff on MOBAs, but it makes lane changing skills too strong and forces the meta in the wrong direction. There just isn't enough diversity in the current card selection to allow for fun or unique builds.
this must be the worst card game i have ever played and you have to pay for it and it takes so long to get used to it that you can't refund this peice of shit game. pay 2 win and ofcourse low skill level as always for these card games .
So anyone complaining about the cost of this game obviously has not played Shadowverse or Hearthstone this game is way less expensive than any of those spend 80-100 bucks on this game and you have yourself an almost full collection counting the 20 bucks that you spent for the game do that for HS or shadow and you cant make a T2 deck lol.

That being said I cant at all recommend the game in its current state like the guy below me said or somewhere this game literally feels like an un finished product there is no daily quest to get in game currency which is fine I guess, but no progression system no ranked competitive ladder no way to add friends after game and no way to chat with your opponent the game feels like a single player game but with 0 advancement they need to add these things or the game will FLOP!! like its already flopping went from 50k viewers on twitch to like 1-2k lol they really need to add these basic features for the game to stand a chance other than that fun game :D
At first i thought it would something pretty fun and enjoyable but as time went on little did i know the power of microtransactions and understanding that you need better cards in order to win some shitty packs that give you replacements anyway.

Idk i did have fun but then i realised it's just simply not worth it with a hilarious player count of under 2k LMAO.

i think il pass and save myself from this dead game by completely stopping.

Trash game

You want Team fortress 3? NOPE

You want Half life 3? Hell nah

You want L4D3? Don't even think about it lmao

Here take this microtransaction game replicate of heartstone and will never be on the same level as Shadowverse xD

まいい、しるか。このげ無わさ訳です‼
Good mechanics and graphics.
A bit too difficult, since I didn't played PC card game (e.g. Heartstone).
Total free card deck was worth 5euros at the time.

Not my taste.

Tried refunding (didn't used community market or trade). Refund refused, because I consumed starting item (steam inventory was touched only by the game itself).

-------
Tried playing once after several month and yea, chill game. Get matchmaked with opponents who always have only cards who do damage and card who locks your handcards, so basically you cannot do anything whole game, while they speed damage. It's chill because you only need to press one button [End move].
I really didn't liked the CARD game there can be a many moments then enemies blocks everything and you cannot use any cards or do any action, but still you need to press [End move]. What the hell...

Overall plain bullshit and very unrealistic (you could not translate this game to real tablecard game with those bullshit in-game), that's why it is much harder to understand rules.

Totally would not buy again, if I hadn't.
GET THE FUCKING TIMER BACK!
I used to be a loyal player for a long time but for now i am done.
Now i am constantly under the stress of this fucking timer.

Dislike until you return old time limit back
Wonder why red are the most expensive cards ? Red Wins.
They have the best cards when it comes to stats (Health & Armor & Damage), meaning that, in every game mode, Red Wins.
Whatever may be your strategy, they will snowball out of control in early game. Red Wins.
They may not have the best situational cards, they will take early and easy control of the lanes, because Red Wins.

It has never been so true in any games that RED WINS, whatever their mistakes may be.
Oh, wonder why Phantom Assassin is good? She wins early against Red Wins. And also, "COUP DE GRACE"
The game isn't worth getting into at the moment due to an identity crisis.  Artifact had a difficult launch and Valve responded by doing a 180 on many features and aspects of the game which were advertised.  The only people I can recommend this to are those who will do free drafts/not spend any money.  F2P grinders might have fun too. The rest of the market should stay far away until the dust settles because there is a strong opprotunity that this game dies or changes so significantly that it may as well have.
I've been playing Magic the Gathering for 25 years.
That being said, this game is insipid, boring and a number-crunching autism fest. The three lanes make everything difficult to read, anticipate and see... and difficult to act accordingly. The UI, while being necessary is also an unreadable bloatfest of numbers. 
Massive disappointment.
This game is trash! I dont care about pay to win with a minor way to get free cards and play for free with less powerful stuff. This game at its core is trash and unfun to play! It is like they looked at Hearthstone said people love getting destroied by RNG and dialed it up to 1 million!!! You dont choose your attackers, you dont choose your blocks, you dont choose what lane your minons spawn in, you dont even choose what spot ur hero goes to in lane. It is all random and horrible! I I have never seen a more Fundamentally flawed game in my life! Now you pile on the most cards are meh and some are OMFG THIS IS A CARD?!?!?! and you just are set up for a bad time.
paid like 30 bucks for some cards and then they immediately got nerfed down to be worth a few cents.  this game is fraud.  valve is a trash company.  they should be investigated for this bait and swith imo.  steam is a good marketplace but i will never spend another dollar on a valve game again.  f yourself gabe.
Trash game. Turns take so long you even have to pass after you already passed ffs. Even if you have nothing to play pass button keeps on ducking you!!
Cmon valve, like the initial no rewards system, wasn't bad enough but not letting us TRADE cards in a TRADING card game that you market as a Trading card game is just insulting. Please address this as soon as possible I just want to enjoy a nice game and trade cards with my mates just like back in the day.
Game is mildly fun but 100% pay to win. Literally 0 skill involved in spending  an additonal $40-$60 for a faceroll red/green deck. At higher tiers when people are on equal footing in terms of cards there can be outplay. But unless you wanan dump $80 into this game from minute 1, be prepared to get shit on.
Real life card games like this are expensive too when you start buying cards. That's probably why I don't play them either.

It's no wonder neo-Valve has gotten into pay to win card games. Minimal effort and you make a shit ton of money off autistic nerds with deep wallets. 

Half-Life 3 will never come out.
played the game for a whole 5 minuites . then wanted to try to get a refund, but they dont allow it becuase you open a free pack they give you . please dont buy this game , its a embarrasmnet to all card battle games
I wasn't buying Artifact because Valve was behind it but because of Richard Garfield having his hands on it. I'm a MTG player since day one, cards and digital. I was hoping for something fancy with that collaboration. 
The graphics and the all around presentation for Artifact are shiny. That's pretty much all it had going for me. The card placement in every turn is random and absolutely minimizes actual strategic gameplay. It looks fancy but if you actually win a game is dependent on your luck with card placements.
It was also my first ever game on steam I demanded a refund for. And I was obviously dumb enough to open the 10 "free" boosters before. No refund when the boosters were opened. And I didn't get the memo ingame beforehand.
I played Hearthstone and probably every digital version of whatever Magic that existed or still exists. All of them are better than this money-grab. Personally sticking with the open beta of Magic Arena by now. I'm disappointed in Valve for the lack of sense for this one and the failing community service considering the refunds.

EDIT dec 25: It looks like it has even gotten worse. They decided to give out 5 "free" boosters instead of 10 now and less event tickets when initially purchasing the game that still costs the same. Besides that and after telling everyone they would not change card abilities once they're out, they started actually balancing/changing card abilities in a trading card game. That is such a no no, I don't even know where to start. You ban cards for certain tournaments or change the way to play them, you don't change the card ability... That adds even more to the pretty big randomness Artifact already has. Balancing the whole thing is what you do before a launch.

I uninstalled and completely deleted the game from steam by now. Selling every card I had will prolly net in around 5 dollars by now, which makes the game price 15 initially. Event tickets cannot even be sold on market so I have to contact support to delete them. I think either Valve has no clue what a TCG is or does know exactly how to play it. I'm confused and really sorry about Artifact.
Game does nothing to me - not a single thing, boring as hell ):
1. there is no great UI or looks
2. there is not a single mechanic that is near interesting - we've seen it all ):
3. RNG is too stupidly overwhelming
4. game is poor - there is almost no strategy, you just play badly designed cards...
This thing can be fun and it's gameplay is alright.
The issue here is that the game is pretty much aimed to microtransactions, the more you pay, the better your experience will be.
I cannot recommend a game where $$$ has such a big impact.
Stay away from this, go to Hearthstone.
Game is a mess. They combined Magic: The Gathering with the mathematical complexity of poker.

Unless you really want to sit down and crunch 18,000 variables, the game isn't remotely competitive. Look elsewhere.
trash game with high price !! dont buy this game be sure this is trash game ever u will give money like this !!! from 10 i give 2 for this trash !! it must be 1.99 $ not this price !!! dont buy this game !!
You pay for game. Must also pay for good cards. Hardly any updates. Fun = 0. Oh and Valve publishes most of there if not all of there games on steam but i still dont see them with steam achievements VALVE YOU ARE SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO TRASH worst game of 2018 by far, i also paid for the game paid about $15 extra for cards , sold all cards after 4 weeks with 0 updates to the game, brought tomb raider for $2
Bought this game and played 45 mins, after that realized I can only buy cards via real money.
Asked for a refund, steam staff said that I can't refund this product just because they gave 10 card packs to everyone (and I didn't even open a single pack at that time).
Gave it another try, opened all my packs.
Played 3 games, 3 defeat, can't do anything with standard cards against donators. Some ppl used such op spells even my 16/10 heroes died by a single card.

Never buy this game. This is the WORST game ever.
This is not a game. It is a pay to win gambling simulation with game paint job. The entire gameplay is hidden behind a paywal after you pay upfront. It is a scam.

*Update* Lowered the product you get for your $20 just to have you unlock it through game play. Still P2W. Still just manchildren who think card games are financial investments, rather than games. Hard Pass. Unless you enjoy a cancerous community who measures its self-worth by how much junk they buy & whose decks they can copy, then this & Magic The Gathering are right for you.
Upon repeatedly opening the game there is no button to claim the included packs or event tickets. It appears to not be showing up for everyone. Also the included marketplace to sell cards to other players is incredibly convoluted and makes it easy to make a mistake. I would strongly recommend not getting the game until valve sorts all this shit out.
Beta players got a headstart with no reset...
Purchasing the game didn't give you beta...
You have no way to grind for additional packs in the game...
The arrows and ability RNG is almost as bad as RNGStone...
The way they set up their own marketplace makes it impossible I assume to refund it as it gives you inventory items...

Valve hasn't made a game in a long time, but their greed is showing here and included the parts of Hearthstone I hated without many of the things I enjoyed from it. This was something I was excited for and I like many of the concepts of the game. I really wanted to like the marketplace idea, but if you're wanting to play a card game you can grind out over time without putting in more money, this ain't it chief.
The story of a nice concept, killed by micro transaction: 

The game is nice, the concept is good, but could be a bit more dynamic, and yet I cant recommend this game. And I would even dare to say that I do ask people not to buy this game. The reason is simple: The best and only card you need in this game is your Credit card. 

This game is a Pay to Win. It is, and that nobody can argue against that. The fact that it is not an "expensive" P2W does not change that. So you will hear and read some fanboy saying that HS is more expensive, and therefore more of a P2W bla bla bla bla. In fact, if you thought you could buy this game and, improve your decks and win more card, your completely wrong, and here is why: 

The only way you can earn packs in this game is by playing the "ticket draft". Your are given a few tickets at the beginning and the draft consist on a series of 5 game in which you need to win at least 3 to be rewarded with a card or a ticket. The thing is, most people (like you and me "casual player) dont win those 3 games, because of a very carefull system of matchmaking that will make you face higher tier opponent as soon as you got your 2 first win. 

As a resuslt, after a while, even if you eventually won a few draft, you will inevitably end up without tickets. You only option then is to spend real life money on it either for aquiering new cards, or for having new tickets. 

To resume You have two option :

-Either you are an really good player, (way above average) and have time to play 40 hours a week, and then maybe you could avoid paying most of the time, but you wont have any life ouside of this game.

-Either you or your dady dont mind paying up to 200$ (at least, if your lucky) to get most of the card and fairly compete with the other casual like you, that chosed to Pay the amount of a month of food to get virtual cards. 

I strongly NOT recommend this game, simply because it is a money trap, and because it misses out on the most important stuff when you play a card game: openning your card pack like back then when you were a chield with the hope to get the uncommon rarity that will make your friend drool. Here you wont open packs, and if you do, you'll probably only get common trash that you will end up selling on steam market for 0.01€. You dont belive me ? Got check the market right and feel the despair of the player after only 2 days of gameplay. 

This game is not very good .Because I play a lot of card games but I feel boring when I play this game .As for me every card game can not compare hearthstone .It is the best card game ever I have been played.So I do not recommend to buy this game .But if u want feel another style of card game feeling u should buy and play this game .Thanks for reading my recommendation.
I thought this game would be for me becuz I dont like free to play (spend a lot of time to grind). Then, I realized this game was very hard. They should remove 3 lanes, 1 lane is enough
CARD NERFING? REALLY? what happens to people who buy axe for $25 ++ cheating death or drowranger? cmon man...just make new sets or something..rather than nerfing goddamn cards...
Sad there is no card progression, I love the ability to just play against AI, but I dont even have the few heroes I want to use and dont want to slam in some rediculous dollars to find those heroes I want.
The game requires you to download this stupid Steam Guard think over a WEEK in advance before you can sell cards. There was no warning about this and I've been waiting to play for MONTHS. The game is also extremely p2w, many individual cards are over $10 a piece! (That's why I want to sell, so I can cash out.)

In a week, I'll be selling all my good cards and cashing out of this stupid game.
This game is a straight up disappointment. It has no achievement to aim for. The gameplay is not that great compare to MTGA or even Hearthstone since a game takes half an hour and no rest time, which make it frustrating to play. 
What worse is: I cannot refund this game :)
BUCKLE UP MOTHER******, DO YOU SUFFER WITHDRAWAL WHEN YOU DON'T SUCK THE TIT MILK FROM THE UNDERBELLY OF CORPORATE DESPERATION FOR RELEVANCY? ARE YOU A MASOCHIST WITH A TASTE FOR MENTAL LIQUIDATION AND DRYING PAINT? THIS IS THE FUCKING GAME FOR YOU. READ NUTRITION FACTS FOR FUN?    THIS    IS     FOR    YOU.
If I knew Valve was going to nurf my tier 1 deck into the ground within three weeks of the game launching, I wouldn't have purchased the game or cards on the marketplace, but as a digital marketplace consumer, that's none of my business...
I do not recommend this game because it is boring. You also arent able to earn cards through the game which really turns me off of it. Couldnt get a refund because i put in 3 hours. dope.
This game WILL DECEIVE YOU. I dropped $200 at the start because I am a highly competitive player (reached challenger/Grandmaster in all the competitive games) and I invested thinking I'd be able to expect some kind of returns for being really good at the game. 20 YEARS OF PLAYING VIDEO GAMES FULL-TIME (I LIVE AND BREATHE GAMES) and this is easily the most disappointing experience I've had. And when I tried to get a refund, the support team does everything EXCEPT for helping me get my money back. Holy shit. I'm so pissed because I sold my only spare valuable possession to be able to play this game thinking it'd be somewhat worth the investment. If I could give this game a "negative infinite/10," I would. I got deceived for believing in Valve and their track record. You'd think after realizing their game died in unimaginable and disappointing ways, they would allow for a full-refund to all invested players. 60k players 1st day, to 10k players by Day 4. Still could not receive my refund to bank account, I don't care about Steam credit, wtf? To them, it doesn't matter even if it was clear that you had the worst experience of your life playing the game and that their game failed, whatever money they conned from you is what they FUCKING ENJOY. Don't. Play. This. Game.
i had fun for 1 week, i had one hell of a time but it got boring real fast, so maybe unless you're really into mgaic or yugioh you can enjoy this, otherwise dont bother

("haf lif ded 4 dis" isnt a valid excuse for thinking a game is bad btw)
I was looking forward to a non-magic, non-AIDS(hearthstone) online card game. This here is made by volvo, which is great.
 But volvo fucked up big time.
All the UI is nice, built in draft trouneys and everything is there. But in its current state, the game is both a RNG fiesta and pure utter pay to win. Every game a dozen coinflips with big impact happen, because a big percentage of core mechanics are completely random.
Whats not random is the fact that you have to buy certain cards in order to compete at all. The strongest right now is a hero card, so it gets played round 1 every game, while being horribly overstatted. It costs more than the game itself right now and basically guarantees a win.
Once you open your starter packs you are unable to refund the game. So get your credit card ready and roll those dice boii. 
I will not touch the game until big parts of it are changed. You fucked up gaben. How did garfield give his okay for half this shit
(EDIT: THE GAME NOW HAS FREE CARD PROGRESSION, BUT IT'S TOO LITTLE TOO LATE)

great card game, maybe even one of the best. but for 20$ you don't get any upward progression, what you get in the staring packs is all you'll ever have in this game unless you whore out the money to buy more. you essentially have enough to make one deck that you like and then that's it (maybe not even that). a card game with only one playable deck is like 1/6'th of game, that's like a demo of a card game, not a full release. not worth 20$ at that point.

if they add some daily quests and some other free to win/play mechanics then it'll be worth the 20$. but frankly for what you're getting in terms of cards it isn't even really worth it, 10 packs is about 20 bucks in the store but keep in mind that there's no other upward progression so 20$ needs to be worth a lot more than 20$.

it's also a bit of a downer to have no goal to work towards, as there's no progression and therefore a little less motivation.

gwent is a free to play game and they offer more free packs and upward progression than this which is a pay to play game. if you're looking for a generous card game go play gwent (though keep in mind that it's kind of in between updates so it's pretty barren atm).
i really like artifact and i want to be able to recommend it, but i can't.
DONT FUCKING BUY THIS GAME! I WAS LURED I THOUGHT THIS IS ALSO LIKE DOTA2 NOT P2W GAME THIS GAME IS PAY TO WIN LISTEN GUYS THIS IS NOT DOTA2 THAT DONT NEED CASH TO WIN. THIS FUCKNG GAME IS PAY TO FUCKNG WIN DUDE IF YOU BOUGHT THIS AT FIRST U LOSE EVERYSINGLE FIGHT CAUSE OF P2W PLAYERS CARDS IS THE ONE ULL PAY FOR + GAMES. SEE DUDE THSIIS RIP OFF FUCK U VALVE WORST SHITTY GAME MY MONEY I GAVE IT ALL TO YOU I DONT HAVE FOOD FOR YEARS AND U JUST GIVE ME THIS HYPE GAME BUT PIECE OF SHT GAME NO WONDER MANY BAD REVIEWS FUCK U
This is not my idea of a card game. Too many things to keep track of.... I quit during the training section of the tutorial. I thought from the videos and review it was different. I have requested a refund for this and don't see myself playing it in future. It is not worth the price mark.
Once i used to be a big fan of Dota overall and valve was my fav gaming company!
you better stop this horseshit valve what the fuck happend to my fav game making company!?
where are my 3s... how can you fall like this!?
Ugly cards, and not enought of them to have fun online.... and the colors of the game make me want to kill myself.
The game as release wayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy to early.
Fun and nice game ! Played for like 30hours the game feels a lot pay to win. You need to purchase every rare and imba card if you want to play competitive or if you want to win. The game is perfect but dont like the idea of the heroes and the cards. Valve need to do some research and repair the whole game because i dont think people will play it for long. The best card is really the credit card. Spend like 100$+ and still needed cards to complete my deck and to become one of the strongest. And to spend 100$+ for a single deck nah ty better buy yugioh and play kappa
It's alright but i can't recommend it right now. I love Valve and i've been hyped for this game but there are big problems about this game. The first problem It's not worth buying packs you can get cards you need 70% cheaper on the market. The second problem is the huge learning curve it's way too complex and having alot of time making a decent deck takes alot of IRL money and effort. The third problem is it's not actually pay to win it's pay to survive let me explain why i say it's pay to survive They have this pay ticket system which lets you enter the drafts if you win 3 times you get your ticket back and if you win 4-5 times you'll get a pack the problem is 80% of the time the draft cards you pick does not sync up with the deck you're wanting to make and it's too hard to find out which card goes with which so it will turn new people off. I don't hate the game and i know TCG are abit confusing to get into first and i'm willing to play it more. This game is well made but the systems need work i love the UI it's crisp and clean and the voice acting is the best i've heard in years props to the voice actors who spent hours on end making voice lines for the cards. The art and graphics are so damn good they nailed it! I love the card art it's simple and easy to adore props to the artists! Right now it's not bad but watch out for the pay 2 survive model if you are a whale then you would have no problem getting into the game but for the average this isn't the game for you yet i know it seems sad but it's true.
i did the first part of the tutorial and won. it was overly complicated for a card game from the perspective of gimmicks. limited control over where you place the cards. you put down your creep cards in lane beside heroes that start in that lane but when you place a hero in a lane you cant choose which side of the already existing hero it gets placed on. having not really been into dota i had hoped that this would be fun anyway, was wrong. it is clunky. i dont understand what the point of a next turn button is if they can play cards during your turn, i dont understand what the point of a next turn button is if you play a card hit it they play a card and then its back up but your resource for playing cards isnt refreshed because the turn never actually ended because the combat phase never happened. i dont understand why the tutorial didnt explain the flow of battle. i spent twenty two minutes playing this and have somehow went from hopeful to enraged.
Its a great cardgame with a lot of promise, here are my main complaints.

It Needs:
- A leaderboard accessible to non-constructed and non-ticket games, whether that be a new mode or casual phantom draft, idc. As long as its a progression system for a non-p2p/p2w mode I don't care.
- A strong MMR that calculates deck-value (we already know the game does this) and matches whales with whales and gamers with gamers.

So far these are my only complaints, progression for the non-whales and MMR for people that wish to play the p2w constructed modes albeit a bit less p2w or evenly p2w.
I was planning on playing this game this weekend but now i can't cuz i was locked out from the marketplace so i can't trade cards.  I have two days, two days that i could play this fucking game this year and now i can't. I don't play draft, i payed for the game, i payed so i could play fucking constructed but now i fucking can't. Fuck you Valve, and the fact that i can't even fucking email you cuz your support sucks makes it even worse. So i am writing it here instead, fuck this game, fuck Valve and fuck you reading this.
The game itself is alright , but it really needs some kind of progression system , playing the game just feels useless and like a waste of time without leveling or questing for rewards at all
There needs to be a way to get free cards , even when u can just grind ur ass off for 1 free ticket per week to play expert play , just give us ANYTHING

Otherwise i just cant recommend the game in its current state
It sucks a*s, avoid like the reeking pile of dog sh*t it is. Most enfuriating and sh*tty game i've yet played, and it doesn't come cheap either.

-sh*t mechanics
-sh*t art
-sh*t balancing
-sh*t everything

Good thing it is dying already. May artifart rest in p*ss and feces, I spit on it's grave . F*ck whatever abominations made this game.
Do not buy this "game". Its genuinely lame.

The mini game in witcher 3 Gwent is a better card game than this standalone valve piece of scheisse.

Do not buy this.
First impression, First tutorial match got AN%#$%lly destroyed because my deck had only equipment cards and healing potions, and the enemy Bot had Direct attack cards, DMG cards, Hero Killing Cards and more. It was fun to lose on my tutorial match. Really FUN!
Negative review since you have to buy each hero .... I give Negative review if you have to buy Heros...  unless its a Dead by Daylight which is so good... :D
Wish i could give this a neutral rating




Pros:
- EXCELLENT gameplay, by far the best card game i have played in my life on a mechanics standpoint.
- Stunning graphics and animations
- Beautiful soundtrack
-Super complex gameplay

Cons:
-HORRENDOUS monetization model, purchasing the game comes with 10 packs and 5 event tickets. Thats it. To get more you have to pay real money or get a really really good run in the event ticket modes.
-You can get dupes for *STARTER PACK CARDS* in your packs! What the fuck were they thinking?? I got 4 starter pack heroes and maaany more starter cards in my packs. I am severely bottlenecked in the decks i can play unless i spend more money. I can play 1-2 constructed decks at most (unless i use my credit card card) and this really breaks my heart.
-The best cards are extremely expensive, going up to 15e for a hero like Axe. What do you call this if not pay to win?
-Absolutely no progression system, this is very strange for a CCG.

All in all its a phenomenal game that is going to die due to an unethical business model, i really have no idea what valve was thinking with it. If you don't spend extra money this game will feel like a demo.
I had to choose between buying this game or going to a Chinese buffet with my friends.

I did not draw General Tso in one of my initial booster packs :/
Want my money back...take this shit away from me
Dota is love
I can buy so other good games or dota items from that money...
so plz give me back my money
Artifact is a game with very interesting game mechanics.
It cost $20 but I never spent anything more during my 125h of play.
There is a free draft mode allowing you to have really fun games with a gauntlet system.

Draft ===
=======
Even with these advantages, Artifact is still fundamentally broken as a strategy game in draft mode.
The impact of some end game cards is such that no victory is guaranteed until the very end.
It could be possible to take these cards into account in constructed mode while planning your next moves, but the draft really is just a huge lottery since those card are often rare and seldom picked.
Strategy is still important, but all your efforts to carefully plan a 3 turns move can be put instantly to the trash in draft mode.
This draft mode is full of good intentions and it did gave me 125h of play before realizing this rabbit hole is full of anger and regret further down.

Constructed ===
=============
Let' talk about constructed now. This game has a broken constructed mode with a cancerous meta that crystalized very fast around too few decks, and I found myself even hating to watch constructed game streams because of how forced all of this seemed. 
However, the strategy aspect of constructed is really deep and even magic pales in comparison of the complexity.
To me that is not enough to make me go into constructed and spend money on packs.

Other aspects ===
==============
It is to be noted that Valve has its own way of communicating with us gamers.
No promises are ever made and their overall strategy has always been cryptic, either turning out to be pure genius or seemingly retarded.
It has not been any different with Artifact regarding their view of Player Progression. No XP system or level was present at first, and they quickly implemented one that was basically a hollow incentive to make us give the game a second chance.
Some booster and avatars can be won at the first levels, then nothing.
The ranked matchmaking system is just based on the number of wins of the season and is so broken it became impossible for me to win a single gauntlet after a few runs.

In conclusion, this game has very solid foundations but fails on so many aspects that its faults can't be overlooked.

I still play from time to time but it is just to get frustrated after having done my best.



I binged it when it came out, was pretty exciting to try a card game based on dota lore

unfortunately I quitly go sick of it. it's missing too much strategy

this post lays it out well:
https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965942959/recommended/583950/

"
Random initial placement of heroes and creeps
Random card draws
Random creep deployment every round
Random attack directions
Random draw of which item from your list you get to purchase during the shopping phase
Random secret shop item and consumable item during the shopping phase, different for each player.
Random card procs (Bounty Hunter, Ogre, etc)
Randomness of card actives (Chainfrost, Eclipse)
"

So many RNG elements really dilute the tactics of the game, and make it very frustrating. 

It's probably fun for some, but if you are looking for a strategic game, you will be disappointed. 

Player base:

60,740 
all-time peak

1,787 
24-hour peak

Game doesn't seem to appeal to a mainstream crowd, and doesn't seem to appear to strategic crowd. Unfortunate :(

I wouldn't reccomend seeing as this will probably one of the games Valve end up making free. The player-base is dwindling and generally all of the good high level players will destroy people trying to get in to this game. Although Valve has made some improvements, I doubt it will be enough. This game appears to be on its way out with only a slim group of players willing to stay in. The card packs you get for 20$ are not worth it and the only way to obtain more cards it to buy them or get lucky in what is essentially Arena from Hearthstone. Valve clearly though this would be the next Magic the Gathering and they where absolutley wrong.
There's actually a good game in here, or at least a good core concept for a good game. But the amount of greed behind the business model just ruins everything. Wish I hadn't helped contribute my $20 towards it. You need to win prized play games to get new cards, and to enter prized play you need a ticket which costs money. You do get some tickets through playing but it's a finite amount, so basically you will get cards if you are able to win at least 4 games for every 2 losses, which is a pretty demanding margin. That's the only way to get new cards behind the limited amount you get for leveling up to level 15. 

On top of all this, the game is pretty RNG based, which I'm personally not against, but it's RNG that is outside of player control and that can easily screw you if you are in an evenly matched game. So in a game where you absolutely need to win to get new cards, the RNG has a little too much influence. It doesn't feel great when you win due to RNG in your favor and it feels terrible when the RNG goes against you. Again, I'm not opposed to RNG in games but it's too much here considering the difficult progression system.
Artifact gets a pretty bad rap with its botched launch, from a seemingly dated pricing scheme in an over-saturated market, to a lack of impact plays, to no progression or ranked system to give a sense of accomplishment. Most of these will hopefully be ironed out in the coming months with new features and expansions, but part of the core gameplay design with how initiative works is very much controversial with no real way to fix it.

How initiative works balances out who gets to go first or second so that whoever passes a turn first for the final time (e.g. you pass, opponent plays a card, you play a card, opponent pass, you pass, then opponent has initiative for next lane) results in deeper layers of strategy, but it ceases to be a card game as we know as you must repeatedly pass turns after every opponent play regardless of if you have any ability to play any cards. Games tend to last around 30 minutes, which is fine for strategy games, but when that's an average for a card game with tons of moving parts, a long setup for win conditions, and no time to breathe as every action results in the other player having a response, even if that is just spamming the space bar to end their turn after each individual piece of a huge combo by their opponent.

I ultimately find Artifact to be fun to play, but it's very draining to get through a handful of games, and with the seemingly rushed release, there is little sense to play it currently, but news several months down the road could potentially bring Artifact back into good graces.
Meaningless skill progression - literally just a grind meter.  RNG is lazy and present in almost all areas of the game from unit arrows, to hero placement, to the item shop, and card design on top of regular TCG randomness.  So many boring cards that simply change arrow direction or unit position.  Feels like a lot of overhead / jockying around until you finally get to see things smash together (which after 50hours becomes very anti-climactic). 


What is there to say about Artifact? The gameplay is great, it's enthralling and challenging, and by the end of a match you almost always feel like you seriously worked for your win, or just barely lost by a hair. Your decisions FEEL so impactful and the game demands your constant attention. However, these also work as downsides for the game, at least for some people. A match of Artifact can easily take 30 minutes or more, and unlike other card games where you can afford to divert your attention for at least some moments, you need to be watching your Artifact game intensely pretty much from the get-go. The game does have some flaws in particular that would be argued, but I would agree are flaws. Attack arrow RNG is commonly touted by many as something you can play around, and while that is true, at a certain point you're just going to lose games because you kept getting bad arrows; especially more likely when not playing red and/or blue due to the lack of redirection. Not being offered the Town Portal Scroll item as well also severely hampers your gameplay, especially against better opponents. Despite my agreement with the statement that "Artifact doesn't need a hook to be fun", it's just common knowledge at this point that players of (multiplayer, at least) games look for some kind of hook, be it the daily quests and drip feed of gold or whatever currency in various other card games, things like free alpha packs for winning in Rainbow: Six Siege, etc. Valve added some account progression sure, but it's not really enough in that regard.  Of course, there's the business model as well which has been discussed ad nauseam, and while I don't necessarily think it's a bad one, this game would have likely seen so much more success as a living card game where you just bought the next expansion for X$ and got full playsets of all the cards. Then Valve could have sold card cosmetics or whatever and things certainly would have been better than what we have now. Ultimately, while I truly do want to recommend Artifact and like it more, I just cannot in its current state, especially with the ever-dwindling player count. The one thing I will say is I don't think Valve will abandon this game so quickly, however the first impression they left was certainly a poor one, both with the Dota community and gaming communities in general. For now it's a hard no, but maybe in enough time Valve will manage to turn this game around.
What i want to comment about is: This game is nothing more than shit balance.
I got this game one week before its formal publication. I had a lot of fun in the first couple of weeks. Even though it has shit match making system (still now), I found playing it with my friends and trying new meta funny. Now there are only two or three decks being played in the standard mode. All in all, the balance is super shit. Some card are just op. once you played them its just hard to lose (like time of triumph). More importantly, those cards are just too expensive. Those flaws make prize play the only reasonable mode for nomal players who dont want to spend alot of money. however, you still have to buy tickets. 
This game is just impossible to have fun even with money. GG
I don't think people should play this game in the current state that it's in and with a community as hostile as this one and that's coming from someone that plays dota. The game could be better in the future but right now it's not worth either your money or attention if it goes free to play.
Played for a bit. I do NOT recommend to play this until we get a decent player base. The current 3,000 remaining pro players are the only ones you will be playing these days. I repeat DO NOT play this unless you are already good (streams-guides-blessed by RNJesus?) OR unless you are willing to spend your time and money in a pretty tiring way. I got my share of fun, but there is no point to continue.

Good sides:
-Beautful graphics. I think it was mentioned by a lot of people, so just a simple reiteration.
-Complex gameplay.

Bad sides:
-Complex gameplay -> the game is unforgiving of the tiniest mistakes. The games are very stressful and last too long.
-Negative sum game. You are bound to lose money and utilize your strongest card one day. Yes, you know which one I am talking about.

I really wanted this game to succeed, but it looks like we are getting further and further from that.
It's ok, I think the learning curve isn't gigantic to figure the game out. Constructed decks are just people playing with the biggest wallet/latest tournament winning deck. 

With that said the draft mode is fun building decks out of nothing. However this can become super RNG when someone gets a super OP hero card 2 or 3 times. Sometimes you get destroyed in the draft because you couldn't get a decent deck together and have to suffer through it. 

After playing I think if you like this regular MTG arena can offer more fun. Maybe in the future I will come back to it but for now I wouldn't recommend it.
Some quick impressions from my short time with this game. 

Unlike in dota where you control a hero, in Artifact you control a side (e g. Radiant) playing against the opposite side (e.g. Dire). You're the commander, and heroes and creeps are your troopers.

Common sense dictates that their basic behaviours (i.e. movement, combat a.i.) should be predictable and controllable since they are under your command. Unfortunately though, creep and hero movements are randomized along with their combat targeting.

Why is this fair or normal? Are my creeps and heroes mentally ill? Are they rebellious? Why is the stupid enemy hero targeting my creep when it can hit my tower? Why is it fun to watch drunk units acting weird on both sides of the board?

Surely there are other forms of RNG that could be applied to both players fairly that doesn't offend players' sense of agency while still appealing to their love of unpredictability. 

Some examples:
- Weather effects that buff/debuff/heal/damage/stun/slow/reposition/charm
- Fog of war
- Neutral creeps
- Random appearance of third parties that do something

This is my main gripe with Artifact. I think the RNG with spells, structures, items amd the item shop is fine provided they balance some of the more OP ones. The RNG with creeps and heroes, on the other hand, will always be unacceptable to me (and possibly quite many others) simply because they defy logical perceptions relating to player agency. Unless the devs make a drastic decision to redesign this aspect of the game, I'm not sure they can ever find a wide and growing audience. There's simply no buy-in. Heck, I paid $20 and I stopped playing after 5.8 hours. That said, I respect people who find this brand of RNG fun. I just cannot, in all honesty, recommend it to anyone I know of.

As a side note, I think it is a mistake to use existing dota heroes. There is more creative freedom in coming up with new heroes.
At the moment I can't recommend the game. There is an unknown issue preventing a number of players, including me, from connecting to matches. The error has no information other than "Cannot connect to game server" and as yet it appears no one has found a solution. Steam support also advised they can't help at this time, and I've been through every step of their troubleshooting guides. 

Fun game, from the tutorial and bot matches it seems interesting but I can't play with other players. Oh, and they wont allow a refund even though it doesn't work.
It's obvious a good effort from Valve and there's a lot of love and care that's been put into this game but I don't feel compelled to continue playing.

The MOBA mechanic feels incredibly forced, well-implemented, but forced. For what reason did the game design revolve around a lane-based, hero selection for cards? Is it simply because it's Valve and they mode DOTA thus this game must be similar?

The aesthetic, voice acting, lore, card illustrations are all very well done. However I don't find any particular card combinations or individual cards really exciting the way I do when playing MTG. There isn't a particular card combination that I see as being incredibly powerful/OP/or exciting to play when it is drawn. Everything feels pretty balanced, almost to a fault that there are linear build paths, and a lack of diversity. This will probably change in a couple of years when many additional cards and mechanics have been implemented but at the moment it feels stale before I've really even begun diving into the game.

I also am not a fan of hearthstone and in general, round based mana allocation. I prefer a land based system (that yes is more random and can result in floods or scarcity) so take my review with a grain of salt. If you like hearthstone then you'll probably enjoy Artifact more than I do. I don't think there's any huge problems with the game, cards are pretty cheap now. IMO just play MTG, it beats all.
Cant say game cant connect to server tried on 3 differnt computers 2 diferent ips. Steam will not refjd me my money cause i tried to get it working for 2 hours witch they consider play time. So terrible support terrible bug rate this 0 out of 5
Its not a good game, give it a few sets maybe? The added complexity mostly works and potentially could work really well. If the game has a long term I think it'll end up being pretty cool.

But right now the card design sucks. Draft is poorly executed and balanced. Everything else is buy to play and the game isn't fun enough to spend $$$ on.
I've played this game for a few times and it is a fun game to play, however there are a lot of drawbacks and I wouldn't recommend this game to most people (if you really love card games and you have enough money you can try this out):
-----
1. The average time for each round of game is longer than the average card games. There are a lot of interesting mechanism but...it just takes way too long to finish a game (in my opinion).

2. The mechanism is a bit complicated. It is interesting that the developers created a new mode that the gameboard is divided into three lanes, this gives the players more choices of strategy but it also make the game more difficult to play. In other words this game is not very friendly to new players. Compares to HearthStone, HS has more friendly interface and the animated characters are also one of its selling point.

3. The game is expensive. It cost you much more money than most card games, which are either free to play or sold at a cheap price. After you purchase the game you still need to buy those expensive cards to get good cards.

So again, I wouldn't recomment this game for now, but if you are a big fan of card games you can try it. I would rate this game neutral if possible.

======================
已经玩了几局但是综合来说并不是很推荐，讲道理要是可以选中评的话就好了。个人现阶段不推荐这款游戏，但是如果你很喜欢纸牌游戏并且有点钱的话还是可以入手的，原因如下：
1. 这个游戏一局的平均时长比其他卡牌游戏要长。在游戏复杂的机制下会使得玩家比较容易失去兴趣。
2. 这个游戏的机制还是很有意思的，毕竟是第一次看见有人把MOBA和卡牌混一起的，要衡量重心放在三路的哪一路，但是机制过于复杂对新手就显得不太友好，上手时间更长而且也减少了可玩性。
3. 这个价钱尼玛太贵了吧，虽然有提供免费的卡组，但是要特别好的几张卡牌都得花不小的价钱去买。

所以总体来说不推荐，你对卡牌感兴趣的话就可以尝试一下。
It's hard to win unless you get good cards. Yes they cost money and practically a pay to win game. 
At a starting price of 19.99, i dont see the game getting a lot of popularity.
Artifact isn't a "Card Game", it's a "Card Movie".

You don't really have control of the game, because 90% of things happen randomly and completely escape your control. You can take some specific decisions, but in reality, all you can do is see how an AI plays against another AI, and wins the one that has had more luck of the two.

The players who love the "Card Games", love them because they love to play "Strategy Games". But in Artifact 90% happens by pure luck, and only 10% depends on your strategy as a player; that's why nobody wants to play Artifact.

In Magic The Gathering the only thing that happens for "Luck" is the steal of the card each turn, and even then it is a "Controlled Luck" because you choose your deck. In Artifact everything works by pure luck... You never know where the Creeps are going to appear, you do not know what objects will come out in your store, you do not know who you will attack each turn because it is random, you do not know in which lines your first three will fall Heroes... It's all chaos and zero control, no strategy and all pure luck.


- You do not have control of your own Creeps.
I lost several games because I had everything perfect, but the Creeps didn't stop falling in the worst place. It's true that you shouldn't be able to control the Creeps, because in Dota 2 you cann't either, but at least they should exit uniformly on each line each round, and not randomly...

- You don't have control of your own Heroes.
It's true that you can choose which line to take them, but they are placed at random as well; don't f*** me... you should be able to choose the position of your own Heroes at least. And you should be able to change that position at least in each round; within the same line or even changing lines (Ganking).

- You can't choose who you attack with your Heroes.
It's worth not being able to choose with the Creeps, but the Heroes a Meele should be able to choose between the enemy of the front and the two annexes to him, and the Heroes of range should be able to choose at least between the enemy of the front and the 4 annexes to him.

In summary, you can only choose 3 things in Artifact.

1. You can choose in which line you want your Hero, but even so, the Hero will be positioned completely randomly. Sometimes it will hurt you, and sometimes it will benefit you. It's pure RNG.

2. You can choose which spells you use on each line. But the games have an average of 6-8 turns, and since the mana is quite limited and most good Spells are expensive in mana cost, you can use between 1-2 Spells per average line...

3. You can choose which objects to buy and which Heroes of the equips. But you should be able to equip the Heroes with these objects when they leave the Source, before downloading them to the board, to get to the line with your new equipment already equipped, as in Dota 2.

The worst thing about Artifact is that it gives you the feeling that you are never in control of your own Heroes and of the game. It seems that everything happens randomly, and you have to fight constantly against the game, as well as against the other player, in order to win. As if the game wanted to f*** you the game by putting "traps" (bad positioning of the Heroes and Creeps) and you had to fight against him every turn to win; that's how it feels to play Artifact... and the truth is that playing Artifact is an unpleasant sensation.

I don't recommend Artifact to players who love card games, let alone those who love Dota 2, because it doesn't do them any justice... If you want a good game of cards, play Hearthstone better -although I personally don't like it, but there at least you control your own game-, or even better, play Magic: The Gathering; but definitely don't play Artifact. And it's a shame... because I love Magic and I love Dota, but Artifact have a lot to change if it wants to be a good card game, and even more so if it wants to be a good card game about Dota 2.

It's a hard truth, but it's the only truth.
You know it's a bad game when you say to yourself "There's nothing I could have done to win that match."
I REALLY want to like this game but there are so many things that make it miserable. Sitting in front of your computer, watching your opponent take 3 turns on 3 boards while all of your heroes are dead just to have them retake initiative and condemn your only way into the game is heartbreaking.
I can no longer recommend people play the game.
The gameplay is nice but grinding your way to expansion packs is next to impossible. Game has still a long way to go if this wants to compete against hearthstone. But for now don't buy this game. It's not worth it
The game is definitely fun to play. However, the updates it got are ridiculous. Chat without permanent mute option is a change for worse. Introducing ranking system that has no explanaition - are you actually kidding me? I saw people lose 5 games in a row, win 1 and rank up! Retarded. 

Thank god they killed cheating death, now please kill the bounty hunter RNG that makes one player unhappy every single turn. I would gladly change my recomendation to positive after 5-8 more patches that move the game in the right direction. Now it's just an early access game.
Solid core game that should still be in early access, but it's Valve so they get to have our money while still be working on getting it right. Artifact doesn't have too much strategy, but it has huge tactical depth. When you are building your first decks (if you enjoy that kind of thing), you have these plans that you envision in your mind of how each turn might unfold. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Stuff gets killed, split or stranded all the time. The game really tries to play around with the idea of randomness as input or output, so you have to learn how to not invest too much on one decision and how to force your opponent to commit in a way that you can take advantage of. 

You probably want to consider getting into this game if:
- you're a M:tG veteran that realized, as Garfield did decades ago, that mana screw/flood is just dumb
- you love DotA 2 and want to get more into its theme and lore 
- you're a hardcore gamer that likes to experiment with new awesome ideas

However, the game's not ready for prime time right now. The UI looks too much like somebody described it in words and a coder implemented it, too many buttons that transform into buttons, too many options that look the same although they don't share the same importance ("view opponent's deck" is not the same as "find next match", which is what you want to click 99% of the time). The flow of gameplay also needs to be reconsidered, as there are too many details that break you out of a smooth experience, namely the forced zoom or status on cards not updating instantly.    

Finally, and this is probably the hardest part, gameplay itself may be banging too much against a glass ceiling that doesn't allow it to go from good to great. The problem with prioritizing tactics over strategy all the time is that wins don't feel really satisfactory and losses can be frustrating. Burning your brain to find a correct decision doesn't feel so good when that decision still gets filtered through a die roll. It may be just how the game works and you know what you're getting yourself into, but it's also why people eventually stop playing. 

Recommending Artificat essentially boils too how much you trust Valve to keep on improving what is still an early-access game. Can I garantee to you that Valve has a solid road map for Artifact 2019? No, I'm not even sure they can actually take on games as long-lasting projects anymore.
I am sorry but I have to change my review, I don't care if it's Valve and they don't know what communication is, they can't just disappear like that and leave the game to die.

It's a shame because this was a very complex and deep card game with a great soundtrack and a somewhat interesting lore (expecially if you already play and love DotA).

Unfortunately the game is clearly not finished, too many features are missing and on top of it there is no real progression system. Add to this the absence of a real tutorial, an entry price of 20 bucks and a ticket system for prize play and you can see why things went they way they did.
If you want to play a great Richard Garfield game that looks good on its new snazzy tcg ui, just play arena. It's absurdly better and while Garfield is a great game inventor Magic in alpha/beta/revised set was absurdly badly balanced overall and took years of rules iterations and sets designed by other people, changing the rarity system many times, how damage happened etc.

Was very dissapointed on release, but still think it could be polished up in the more distant future, likely will check back in an expac or 2 but for now its a big stinker.
If you dont want spend about 60-80 euro on combo decks, don't buy, you have absolutly no chance to win. There is one combo deck, maybe two, in every single game, and you have to be superlucky to defeat it.. So boring after few games, bcs it's still same.. this fgame could be good, but wait until free 2 play, or masive balance update..
For people who wondering whether you should buy it or not. Dont worry you wont miss out on anything if you buy later. No progression. I wish I didnt buy it earlier :( But maybe after today update something good will come. So much hype for this game during the announcement but after a while playing it, it felts really empty. The gameplay have too much of randoms (rng). It has not progression, playing feels empty. But the mechanics are surely fun and very in depth. I hope this game will gets better soon. But for now, for anyone who want to buy it i suggest, you check out gwent, a card game which 100 percent better and FREE. OR just wait until the new update whether valve will change anything
I cannot recommand it to anyone.

There is some depth but it is ruined by rng. Eg. heores can initialy randomly match opposing heores or creeps. Red heroes want that, blue/black not. If you play control deck, you may get locked out of 3 lanes for 2 turns and on top give opponent a few items.
There is relatively little variety. Everything revolves around going face. In mtg there are multiple ways of winning, and a few cards that provide completely out of the box win/lose conditions.
There is almost no incentive to log in for casual players. There are no grind->reward loops. You will get stomped everytime competitive and quickplay. Unless you have friends to play 'kitchen'... but friends making up for a game is a poor excuse.

And probably most importantly. Pay to play and copious amounts of microtransactions. On top of pretending pixels have monetary value.
In the current state it's in this game is a disaster.
After a pay to play game you get a game where there is no progression.
You want progression? you need to pay to either purchase tickets or packs.
just a money grab!


Stupid pay2win game.Since it is from Valve same gamble happen like in CSGO.You will recieve same heroes over and over again.I hope they block this in Europe

This box opening really should work like in dota 2.


- after 2 hours and 4 minutes i asked for refund , was rejected
- worst game ever
meh, feels like too much RNG, even for a card game. and other players take forever in their turns, need a faster clock. wouldnt recommend unless you are super into playing a complicated card game with a heavy pay to win element (unless you grind like hell to get more packs)
1. You got no chance to get cards for free.
2. You got no ranked mode -> Its boring to play for nothing.
3. You need to buy the game. Other card games like Hearthstone are free and you are able to get cards by playing.
it's so much fun and still the randomness is killing me and forcing me to thumb down its review.
fuck i still love this game but i can't play it, it's just .. it's like a girl you love but she's not in love with you :)
it was fun, until i saw the cards i want costing around $4 - $10 per card, and realize building my deck gona cost me more than $40 (exclude the $20 game price).

$20 is not nearly enough to enjoy this game. Maybe u need $100 to fully enjoy this card game, which I'm not willing to spend for this kinda game ;)
WTH is your green card design???
When other classes (red, black) have to play cards to get a single modification, green improvement can modify allies with +1 attack each term without any condition???
Oh and don't forget the 4 cost multiple silence.

So BALANCED.
Currently there is no reason to play the game other than personal satisfaction. No rewards, nothing. Just more of the same cards if you buy the expensive ass card packs. But it definitely can be fixed, if Valve cares enough. Will update as time goes on.
An amazing game that is currently getting dragged down by the market meta they have set up. Because Valve wants to avoid swinging the market by nerfing/buffing obviously under/overpowerd cards this game will be dead soon. A shame though because the game itself is amazing.
!Edited Review!

So you saw the update and fell for the trick huh?

So you're wondering, "Did the update make the game better?"

Short answer: No. 

Long answer: There are fundemental problems with the game that this update doesn't address.

Problem 1: Still no worthwile system for excess cards. I'm sorry. Paying $1.99 for a pack and getting back 12 cents (maybe) on the market is awful. It's really bad, I don't want to hear the MTG turn overrate retoric because quite frankly it's bullsh!t. This game needs to submit completely and change. There is no value in digital cards. Period. I don't care if Axe is selling for 9 dollars still. Axe has never and will never be the problem that people swear he is. Drow has never and will never be the problem that they swear she is. The problem is the game. And it's greed driven concept of your card is worth 7 cents we'll tell you it's worth 3 cents because we do not actively update the prices. Which means you'll have to ALT+TAB to see actual value. And while you're tabbed out why not just play another game? It's a bad system that at first I was excited about and now I realize. Yeah. MTG:A and Hearthstone are doing it right. The market is near endlessly flooded with more duplicates which means your 2 dollar card is now worth 20 cents if you're lucky. That works with a physicall good. Not a digital one. I played the TF2 stock market. I played the Dota 2 stock market. You sell high and then you leave because the lows will be super low and they will not increase. 

Problem 2: Content. This game needs bi-weekly or tri-weekly updates. It needs events. It needs cards. Balance patches. Etc. I've played all the cards. I've seen all the decks.. This has been out since November. You changed some cards I don't care about and added a system that has a finite reward system. Yes. It's finite. You will not constantly be rewarded packs. You will not constantly be rewarded anything. If you lose this system is basically useless because you'll be lucky to get more than 25xp and each level requires hundrends of xp. You will hit a wall and like they often do, Valve will tell you to pay up or move on.       

This game. Could be and should be better. Valve, could be and should be making this game better. They are not. I can't tell if this is because they're upset that it wasn't an instant success. I can't tell if they plan to slow ween Dota for this like they did TF2 for Dota. I really don't know but there is literally hundreds of images of concept art that could have been used for cards that they simply never used because they want to hold back. This game needs content. Fast. Quickly. This isn't Hearthstone now. It doesn't have thousands and thousands and thousands of cards with arena and story modes and so much content that just throws cards or packs at you. This isn't Magic, it doesn't have infinte replay ability because billions of deck possibilies and new game formats. This game is Artifact. It's boring. There are 3 decks worth playing. There are 10 heroes worth using. It's time to either make some changes and add some content or give refunds and admit it was all a mistake. 

Do not pay for this game. It is not worth it. At all.
Too much random for a game that aims to be complex and competitive. More than that, cards and colors are too unbalanced which means that coupled with the overwhelming random, a game can be settled before it even begins. No ranked mode, and the cards are quite ugly. 

Otherwise I think it was a nice idea. The shop, the lanes, the heroes and signature spells were all good ideas but there are too many mistakes to actually enjoy the game.
Day 1 : The game is interesting, feels not bad.
Day2 : Fill money in steam wallet, purchase the card pack.
Day3: Quite tired for playing this game.
Day4: Start irritable.
Day5: New meta of Hearthstone is coming. 

Goodbye Valve. Goodbye Artifact.
I was waiting untill they release the ranking system in order to play this game more and give it a positive raiting, because it is a good game despite people whining about pay2win. I am tired of waiting and playing games where nothing happens when you win or loose. It seems that the developers do not care about the game, why should I?
game is not too bad but with no in game currency and the only way to get more packs being to spend 2-3 dollars on a pack. I cannot in good nature recommend this to someone
I love the part where buying the game isnt just buying the game, its also getting 5 card packs, which if you open you can't refund the game if you aren't enjoying it because they count as micro-transactions!!!! nice one valve, waste of 20$
Fun game but no free way to earn tickets topay for entry fee for the tournaments or drafts. (Draft entry fee is 2 tickets and 5 unopened packs!)

Even Magic: Arena gives you a way to earn gold to buy stuff.

Made more money selling cards than the price I paid for the base game. But $2 boosters x 5 plus two tickets to enter a draft tournament is way too high. Even though it was fun...
I just got charged for this month Dota plus .. so if anyone has resources and time to chase this FALSE promisse of free dota plus month .. I would appriciate it. (I dont care its only for .. dont bother .. it stated clearly free month- as valve states to players "if you feel like you are doing something to cheat the system you probably are and its unaceptable.." 
So  keep Your word.. FREE MONTH as it states on the banner.

Its just a card game loads graphics card like hell.. 
Im not happy about purchase and I own all valve games ..this is the first one I dont appriciate for now 
.. I will give it a try but not worht the money for me at a moment.
Really nice game it will be even better in the future i am sure. 
If u like card games complex strategies this is it, i come from gwent & dota 2 and i really like that u have to think a lot about everything (hero position is the most important for me).
Now there is a way to build a collection but u have to be very good and very lucky to go infinite with tickets but i suggest buy the cards u want and make a deck, most of them are not that expensive or play only draft (really fun mode btw)  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Deckbuilding in this game is fun or u could just netdeck ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Anyway PepeHands if u dont mind spending some money from time to time this game is pretty fun
-After 2 months
game is just not that fun it is unbalanced they added a really bad "progression" system the rank is not really a ladder nor u play with players of the same skill and finally u get 5 packs instead of 10 with your initial buy valve fucked the game before it even started
The game is fun, but the monetization structure is unpleasant to approach. It seems like the developers are after money for every single value that they provide to players. Considering that there are other games out there who are more player-centric & fun-centric, this game will only retain players who are willing to spend money for progression and domination, and chase away players who enjoy this game as it is.
I have no doubt that this game is potentially one of the best card game. However, it's absolutely an incompleted game so far for me. There is no rewarding system, neither recaps for my previous games. Since players are unable to interact with each other like hearth of stones does, I feel like I am playing a single player game. The game is also long-winded which make it boring. Expecting improvement.
Tldr; An awesome gameplay ruined by the monetization decisions and, apparently, no balancing of cards.

I was a casual DotA player (~3.8k hours) and when Artifact was announced, I got excited because my reflexes are too slow for DotA now and a DotA-based Valve-developed card game seemed interesting.

Thing I was expecting when Artifact was announced and not a lot of detail existed
- a card game with most of the monetization on the Cosmetics side
- relatively cheaper trading (compared to a $15-20 Axe card). Was hoping that a full deck on average would cost within $30 (given that it is a digital card game)
- a good ranked gaming experience
- some sort of grinding system

But once the game released
- paying is the only way to get cards
- a couple of very OP cards that you have no way to counter (looking at you Time of Triumph; and to an extent, Cheating Death)
- you have to pay to play ranked (WTF!)
- games are too long on average

There are a few nice thing though
- phantom draft are fun, but drafting process itself is time consuming since you have consider the packs' RNG. You cannot say "ok I'll build a deck around summoning creeps" in phantom draft because the cards you need might not appear. After 5 games, you have to rebuild a deck (I think). If you want to play certain "built" decks and not pay anymore than the game's base cost, time is how you will be paying it with
- very well made game art
- once you have a deck you want to play with, the gameplay itself is entertaining

DotA2 is insanely successful because of it's F2P model. They made counter-strike F2P now. Fortnite is an F2P game. Monetization through Cosmetics is what is getting them the play base. I dunno which genius thought about the monetization for Artifact, cause the player base is showing that it is not working. And having to pay to play ranked. And no progression system. And no balancing system.

All in all, it's a no-no
Pretty good game, gameplaywise.
You start with 3 mana so there is no lull moment in the beginning.
The heroes are pretty cool and the game is complex enough that its very challanging. Ive only been playing with budget decks but I have managed to beat meta decks by playing well.
Valve is very closed out from suggestions which made some aspect of the game bad. Like how drow was OP in beta but valve only changed her rarity and nothing else.
I wish there was a progression in the ranks tho. Dota has ranks from Herald to Divine. How come this doesn't? We can't even see our ELO/MMR.
Also, I wish they would release the next expansion soon as constructed is very limited with only 1 expansion.
Don't buy until valve changes the way card procurement and use and rarity works.
I cannot in good conscience recommend this game. It has good aspects, but it is far outweighed by the horrible market, stressful, long matches and endless RNG. It is not fun, nor is it worth your time or money.
Bought it because generally Valve makes good games and I've enjoyed everything they've released up to this game.  I think the mechanics are needlessly overly complex. I don't think having the "three lanes" adds to the gameplay. It has potential to be a good game, but if you're a working professional like me and don't have time to spend hours every day studying the game mechanics or play 30 minute minimum matches then it's a bad game. If you want a "hard core" game and if you have copious amounts of free time and money then this could be a good game for you. What drove me to ultimately giving this a bad review is Valve apparently refuses to issue refunds after you complete the tutorial. I've been on steam since it was released and have hundreds of games in my library but this is the first time I've ever been denied a refund.
Let's ignore the card-obtaining system, which I don't mind (like buying individual cards irl). I refunded this during the fucking tutorial, people tell me it's the most difficult card game out there, but all I see if the most braindead way to convert a game from one genre to another...at least Overwatch skills make sense in a MOBA setting (HotS). There's no ultimate strategy or combos, and you just spend half an hour in slow-paced, limited-moved, three-laned (because one just make this even more braindead) pretentious bullshit.
What a disappointment this game is. First you need to buy in to even play the game and then it surprises you with the worst business model in the whole digital card game genre. 

I fell I've been scammed and that by a company that should be swimming in money already.
At the momment, my game crashes every 3-5 minutes or so, and is basically unplayable as you miss turns ect while waitng for the game to reload. Not sure how common this problem is.
Fun game, but random hero lane deployment at the start of the match shouldn't happen in a "DOTA card game".  It really leaves a bad taste considering how important the first two to three rounds of this card game is.   We should at least be able assign hero lanes in  the beginning of the match.  It leaves room for mind games etc.

You have to be 100% zen to enjoy this game long term because there will be games where winning is completely out of your hands, even in draft modes.  The list of competitive heroes is very shallow out of the 40+ hero pool.  There's some mechanically interesting heroes like Storm Spirit, Rix, and Meepo, but the current state of the game doesn't allow much room for them.

There's too many cards,  yet minimum deck requirement is too low to allow room for some of the more interesting deck building possibilities.  This game rewards whoever builds the leanest 40 main spell and 9 item decks simply because it gives you a higher chance of drawing the cards you need at the right time.  There is very little wiggle room. if any.

Shop item values seem very imbalanced; some items are way too cost efficient to pass up (Revtel Signet Ring) while other experimental items cost too much to warrant purchasing.

It's a fun game but I cannot recommend purchasing simply because it leaves a very bad taste even in drafts.   Notice how I didn't even talk about the community market aspect of constructed.   I got my $10 worth of fun (sold some rares) but I cannot recommend this game given its current state.

DOTA is all about your team trying to make game-winning decisions from beginning to end.   This game makes too many random decisions for you to be called a DOTA card game.
The game is just overly complicated for a card game. i found the tutorial very confusing and didnt see much hope to playing futher. also the tutorial its self was rather long winded for a single game and dumped too much info on me to really keep track off. i didnt even fished that first training match. so based on that 20 min alone i can't recomend this
Game isn't balanced, If you look at the market there or 5 or 6 cards that cost double and even triple the amout of all the other cards on the market because they are OP and broken.

Valve has said they will not rebalance the cards so this game will remain for ever broken.  Dont waste your time when there are other free options that are better.

If you are thinking about buying this game. DONT.
For once not a down vote because of the monetisation.

My frustration with this game is that the tutorial is incredibly bare bones and gives you no idea what to do.

If you persist with it you can netdeck but there is a significant likelihood that you won't have the cards straight off the bat.

But then when you feel you may be getting a grip on exactly what the game is about you realise that random creep spawns can swing the entire game even if you have been in  control the entire time (maybe because of your own luck with creep spawns).

People have always lauded Hearthstone for its RNG but I would argue that Artifact has RNG on a much greater scale but hides it.

It's a fun game with cool mechanics but its so frustrating to lose after being in control the entire time purely due to creep spawns. 

(<- admitedly only on about 10-20 games but I can't be bothered anymore).
The game is really funny to play for a couple of hours, just right up untill you want some new cards. the 18euro price tag is just a JEBAIT, it costs way more if you want to play the entire game. Just like LoL but this is worse because there is no way to grind your way to new cards.
This is a great game... when you are in a game. Everything before and after is bad.

v1.1 update: still no match history? How can you even launch without this?
Not too great when its clear which cards win the game. just look at the prices, once you get down to it there only seems to be 2-4 builds that could be competitive due to specific heroes one shotting others and their extra cards being far superior.
its a fun game but its not fufilling at all if that makes any sense. theres potential if they do a good expansion or change the values on a few cards but as it is its clear who will win aside from the RNG or "heart of the cards"
Preliminary thoughts - This is just a watered down card game. The three lanes concept is interesting, but it just doesn't come together like it should. Comparing it to MTG: Arena, it's just kind of boring. The only cards that have interesting abilities are the improvements, which give passive bonuses, but they are also kind of OP. I also feel like the game has an awkward pace, where it ramps up very quickly, but then becomes obvious who is going to win. 

I actually do like the concept of the market, but right now there's just too few builds to really express yourself. Here's to hoping they make a good amount of new cards with interesting abilities over time. If that happens, I will be happy to return to the game and recommend it.
The gameplay is fine. But When you pay 20$ for a card game you should be able to enjoy it without spending more money! if you got a couple of hundred dollars lying around then yes buy this game if you think you can enjoy this game only by spending the first 20 dollars you are sadly mistaken. :) and in comparison, hearthstone has a much better design and is free to play. you still have spend money to have the most fun but at least you get to try the game for free before buying anything!
So first , nice game tbh , but there`s a problem , wheres is the progression ? progression is rlly important in a game if u dont wanna get bored easily, we need levels we need rewards, we need EXPERIENCE / second: rank system pls, why expert mode requires tickets ? that requires money ? why we would pay for a expert game just to get more tickets and 2 card packs ? I feel like im being like (why u want all this money) you are a big company that have lot of money and im pretty sure u can find another way to get money in this game not like this. the only way u have to win fukin 5 expert games is having a good cards that u bought before play expert (or u do this or u gonna get fucked by people with good card) pretty surte the strategy is rlly important but there are cards so broken than u dont gonna get them in the 10 free card-packs hahaha ( im laughing but crying hard at same time), so why i would play expert to get "another ticket" and have card-packs if i have already all cards i need atm ? Someone will say: "you can create new decks cards with those u get on expert game" pretty sure you will get the good cards in those card packs boy. fix those stuffs or u will get a good game dead in short time.

We need get rewards just playing casual like : if u win those amount of games get something instead of experience, or if u win an amount of games in a row get something

Thats okey the way u have to give your cards to get a ticket, but i think just for some times not to do it constantly , but still thinking why the heck those tickets even exist ? im still not getting this.

Btw, i like this game and i will still playing it , but hope those things that i said dont make me want to leave soon.
it's been 8 years since the last real new Valve game was released, and this is what we get for all that time waiting

No L4D3, Portal 3, HL3, new IPs... we get this shit card game instead

getting very sick of Valve! They can't live off their name forever. I'm happy that Apex and Fortnite are finally starting to provide some real competition to Valve/Steam. We just want some classic Valve games again. not this... whatever this is...
I would like to start this off by saying I honestly very much enjoyed this game through about the 2- 5 hour mark. I felt like I was outplaying my opponent when I succeeded, and lost when I made a misplay. Obviously including normal card game rng that can not be controlled. I found this game very enjoyable until I started playing against the "Broken" cards in the game. Obviously their will be stronger cards then others, but Axe and Drow Ranger I found very frustrating. I would honestly be okay with these cards if you did not have to shell out $20 for Axe and he is almost a must have in any somewhat competitive red  deck (most decks want to run him). I would honestly understand this , but you are making an initial $20 investment, and to stay competitive you need to spend significantly higher. It is also very difficult to obtain more cards without investing more because you find yourself playing against the best cards while you have your "budget deck" that you already spent a decent chunk of change on.

I do find this a shame because the overall concept of the game is very fun and engaging. It has been a while since I have enjoyed a game as much as I did, while beginning to learn this game. I feel this game had the potential to be a fantastic game, but they I believe Valve was a bit to greedy. This game may have the potential to redeem itself, but I feel it is to late.



Really dissappointed about this game, I mean I have read news that there will be pricey/OP cards to abuse but this really feels like, as someone mentioned in similar review, bullying.
Playing casual you just really hope that there wouldn't be this creditcard kid who bought all the OP stuff and just bullies the crap out of you.
The real dissappointment here is that this game doesn't offer "coming back" feel like for example hearthstone does with ranked games where you keep coming back to climb the ladder to achieve better rank than before, feels like there is no point of playing unless you have the best cards.
I get it it is not fully pay-to-win and there is phantom draft to play and try to get some packs, problem is that thats all theres to it with unplayable casuals and gauntlets, if you don't want to invest in buying packs there really isn't point buying this game.
They really need to change the system of heroes to more balanced and easier ways to get additional packs without paying but by playing, for example implementing ranked with reward system.
The mechanics and animations are cool along with the combat system, i'd say the games are really slow sometimes and boring but I know that's just my preference.
I rated this review negative only because lack of the "coming back" feeling and unplayable casual games where you intend to master/adjust your deck but it is hard when just get into onesided matches where your winrate is close to 0 from the start even with a starting godhand.

If you have a creditcard and want to bully others, this is the right bullying simulator of 2018 for you!
The Game itself is very good and fun, a bit anbalanced but what is in valve games anyway.... Having said that i just want to add that charging 20$ for a game with no actual in game way to earn cards is not okay... the game should be free given that THE ONLY WAY you can get new cards is if you buy them inside the game store for real money, they are not cheap either but that's not the point. 

Casual Matchmaking is unreal and just downright frustrating ... You RARELY! stumble across someone who hasn't spent at least 100$ on cards and has a SERVER advantage, again if you want new cards YOU HAVE TO BUY THEM, otherwise you are stuck with your initial deck :D

The game is very fun and it shows it when you play the Call to Arms mode where you have pre-built decks and its the player's skill that determin the outcome of the game not the size of one's credit card.

For now i am leaving this negative review hoping to change it in the future because personally i was excited for this game and it delivers but in a  catastrophically wrong way .... Like for Real Valve ... At least some basic reward system would be nice..............

Card game is fun enough once you get the rules down. I'm not the world's biggest fan of the rng nature of the arrows, but it adds to the excitement and suspense of casual play. I also wish the game would continue until ancient is destroyed rather than just 2 towers... 

Those are just gripes though. The main issue is that after you pay $20 for the game, it is still pay to play. There is no way to freely continue building decks simply by putting time in and playing. Once you run out of the 5 tickets you're alotted at purchase to participate in expert play (the only way to build decks w/o straight up buying cards). You have no other choice but to buy cards outright or buy more tickets.

I'm all for being able to dump $200 into a game that I like simply because there's something I really want and believe it's worth it. I dump tons of money into Dota every TI simply because I like the game and wants the stuffz.. but not even letting players really get their feet wet in the game before putting up a paywall and sticking your hands out is simply exploitative.

There needs to be some better method to allow for people to put time in and slowly build their deck w/o having to make sure credit card is on standby when they boot up the game; and then 200hrs in when/if they feel like spam buying packs to get the shiny animated PA, which I'm sure will eventually be a thing, they can. 

TL;DR uhh.. need to buy tickets to get cards w/o buying packs. need cards to play game. i think equals shit system especially when you're charging $20 out the gate. lemme know if I missed something.
Too many random chance mechanics. Summon positions are random, targeting is random, 2/3rds of item draws are random. There's skill here, but it's very watered down.
The monetization model prevents this game from being truly for the masses. 
Matchmaking is shitty for someone who doesnt want to pay money, as we have to face opponents who have bought the stronger cards

While the game has great depth and is easy to understand, making it not possible to earn stronger cards through play is the biggest turn off for casual gamers. With the pay to win model, I dont see this game surviving on mobile platform either.
Pay to compete, no way to progress as a casual player....which you will be unless you want to shell out another $25-50 at minimum.

Artifact could be a lot of fun to play casually, will see if it gets updated with daily quests or something to give casual players a reason to get into this game.
Do not get this game if you don't plan on spending more than the base price of the game on it.  I figured it might be fun to play around with it in "casual play", which matches you against "players of similar experience", using just the starter cards and the packs you start with, but if you aren't lucky enough to get many top cards in your starter decks, be prepared to play against players who either did or were willing to dump money on the marketplace to get them.  Your decks made of what cards you got will go again and again against the finest netdecks that money can buy from other new players.
The game is a cash grab. There is no way of getting free packs, It is near impossible to go infinite in any expert mode, The 10 "Free" packs give duplicate resulting in my example only getting 5 near heroes out of the ten packs. Play magic, play hearthstone. It sucks because the gameplay is cool and fun but the marketing team has created the worst economy possible.
While I personally do not reccomend the game, it is solid, ignore all the people review bombing it because of the microtransactions. After adding $5 to my steam wallet, I picked up every single card I wanted in under 2 two minutes and still had two dollars left. Compare this to hearthstone where you will be grinding for months. 
As for the gameplay itself is where i take issue. While there are some great twists such as the shopping system and changing the win conditions shakes up the standard set of rush, control, tempo card games you see, the inability to sleect where your heros land who they attack removes too much of hte ability to control what is happening. For all the strategy and planning you can make, so much of it gets pitted against a coin toss that it feels less like planning and more like praying. The game in games for me is the ability to out think, out wit, and over come opponents. This much chance in a game however removes much of that joy as no small minority of actions are beyond my control. Its not for me. However thsi does not mean that others who have different taste will not like it, it is a solid easy to pick up game with lots of replay value.
I feel I gave it a fair chance, but it's just frustrating and frankly full of broken/ unbalanced cards. It would be fairly easy to make an accurate prediction of who is going to win if you know what cards someone has drawn(not what's in their deck, the ones they actually draw), their heroes, and add in the same random generator that randomizes hero location at start.

Which means HOW someone uses those cards they draw is of little importance. All that matters is the random generation. It's very rare to have an actually good game where you're not cheesed to death. Too much cheese.
No way to get more card if you don't pay or perform really well on draft expert mode if you loose and have no more ticket avaible you cannot acquire more card or ressource to enter some game mode withou PAYING !
A disgrace for a game that already cost 18 €
DON'T BUY IT UNTIL THEY ALLOW PROGRESSION WITHOUT PAYWALL !
I really like the game so far but I can't recommend it for the following resons:
-Expert Play is kinda ridiculous that you need to have a 75% winrate just to go +/- 0, so actually winning packs is only possible if you buy a powerful deck for constructed play so you are competitive or really need to get lucky in Draft. You can easily waste 10€+ for tickets in draft without ever getting new cards there.

-No Draft mode for the social play modus.

I can recommend the game if you look for a free casual Draft mode at the moment.

The game mechanics are solid(tactical depth) and is fun even with the sometimes very random nature of the game.

I really would like to see some more fair chances at earning new cards or recycling for packs instead of tickets because tickets are pretty much useless progression wise because of the low chance to win.
Every Tom, Dick and Harry here is complaining about the games biggest problem being pay to play, but I dont think that is an issue at all. I understand what Valve is trying to do with the monetisation of their game. They are trying to give their digital cards, physical value, making opening pack and trading a core aspect of the game - similar to what you would expect from a physical game such as Magic. 

Here's the real problem with the game.. Most card games rely on a bit of luck in the card dealing phase of the game, but It is almost always possible to come back from a cr*&&y draft and end up winning the game. 
This is where Artifact differs, the ENTIRE GAME is based on being lucky and there is nothing you can do to stop it.
Your cards are dealt to you (luck)
Your heros are assigned to random lanes (luck)
Your cards are given random positions within already random lanes (luck)
It just doesnt stop! There are so many aspects of Artifact that rely on luck and for that sole reason, It will never be esport ready and It will never earn my recommendation.
这个游戏是真的垃圾，神奇的不可控战斗机制，随机的商店刷新，可以随机的东西太多了，和免费的炉石传说相比我选择炉石传说


This game is real garbage, magical uncontrollable fighting mechanism, random shop refresh, there are too many random things, and I choose the hearthstone compared with the artifact .
No updates. Dead game. Last update was like 2 months ago. DO NOT BUY IT. 
We should make kickstarter event to sue Valve. 
This game is the biggest Scam of 2018
Currently disappointing, the core gameplay is good but without any form of progression or ability to gain packs/tickets without paying, the game quickly loses any incentive to play (for an average player)... hopefully with some updates and a progression system this will be improved, small things like daily quests, acheivements, etc. could make a big difference.
get charged $20 for a pay to win game with no way to earn cards. completely stupid concept with games like MTG Arena and Hearthstone out with MTG being more complex than this unbalanced game anyways.
This piece of shit is released to serve THE purpose--draining your credit card.
Axe and Time of Triumph, two cards, crushes the entire fucking game.
Balancing is a joke, if a balancing team actually exists.
DO NOT BUY THIS SHIT, it brings nothing else than depression and anger.
I understand why people have left valve alone regarding COSMETIC mtx in Dota and CSGO, but this is the most disgusting form of mtx i've seen in a long time. Literally unable to expand collection without paying for cards - and they have the balls to release this game with a price tag. 

Don't buy this game. It is a shitty cash grab 

If you're looking for an engaging and interesting card game (that doesnt rip you off), I would recommend MTGArena or Faeria.
can u atleast make it so 3 melee creeps and 1 range creep shows up in each lane?  and make my tower able to hit creeps and heroes, i would keep going but this is just to start lol, game needs so much work( i have so many ideas on how to make this game more fun.)... game is unimaginative, and uninspired.. incridably sad, because the moba genre is full of ideas.
Buyer beware. If you open the free packs for completing the tutorial you can no longer refund. Wish I had payed closer attention. Honestly the games RNG is to much for my taste. Play mtg arena and hearthstone and this game definitely has the highest amount of RNG. 

The one pro it has is you can buy individual cards but still can't recommend.
Convoluted, boring, tedious mess. Games take age to resolve.

But the worst - it's a blatant cash grab!!

Once you go past the tutorial, you get automatically flagged as having "consumed" ingame items, whether you opened any card packs or not, resulting in denial of any refund.

ATROCIOUS consumer policy, Valve should be ashamed of themselves.
Too much randomness.
Fun game, and I don't mind paying for cards, but good lord some design choices are beyond dumb. the more you play the game the more crazy bad rng you see in a game.

You know those mtg games were you muligan 5 times without seeing a single land? Almost every loss feels like that.
I really enjoyed the game in the beginning, but Valve let it die. Thanks Valve for being a company that still thinks proper communication and roadmaps are not mandatory if your playerbase is disappointed with how you handle the product.

In for the long haul...yeah, great updates so far -.-
Right now this game is... incomplete.  While there's much ado about the p2w aspect of the game it really isn't a problem per se other than the balancing issues caused by OP cards and strategies.  I assume this will be smoothed out in the future.  The main problem is that that I bought the game,  bought a few cards.. Sold the extras, bought a few with the proceeds, made some reasonable looking decks, then used my tickets to enter some events.  And proceeded to lose every single game due to untenable starts or the opponent started with Axe.  (Two armor?  Seriously?) Anyway it is what it is.  So I looked for something else to do and.... there's nothing.  No ranking, leaderboards, stats,  crafting, quests, rewards...  nothing.  Just buy cards- or not, and win or lose in meaningless casual games.  The shame is the actual gameplay has potential and seems like it COULD be reasonably fun - in the future.  But now it's just dull and pointless.
I completely understand offering no free packs/tickets as it would ruine the market of their game. I also don't mind paying as if this were a real card game at a shop for cards/tourney/etc. 

My issues with this game are the randomness that cant be controlled. Units randomly go to lanes, heros randomly switch target location, 9 cost golden tickets give anywhere from healing pots to game ending items. I also am having an extremely hard time understanding if i'm making bad plays to lose a game, or good plays to win a game.

I've played card and board games for years, and the key to keeping my interest is me learning and getting better as a player. I find it very hard to do that in artifact. I was extremely excited for this game and i'll continue to give it a chance and change my review if imporvements are made.
As a long time player of Card Games, Yugioh, Magic, Pokemon, and even Digimon, this game is FUN. However, DO NOT BUY IT. I don't care how fun this game is, unless you plan on paying REAL MONEY for anything, you will only get 10 packs to play with. Everything in the game cost REAL MONEY. There is no way for a player to "get anything new" without spending REAL money. Many of my friends won't even pick up the game because of the lack of progression. Being fun isn't enough to continue playing when you have to continue to pay money into it. Cash grab at it's best.
Just bear in mind that you do not pay for the game itself, but for the 10 card packs and 5 tickets it comes with.
It seems fair and all, but if you open those packs that they bundled into this scam, then you are not eligible to a refund anymore.

So if you plan to try out the game and then refund it, then just don't open the packs or use the 5 tickets... which means you can't really try it out...
This game has a lot of potential, but oh boy they made mistakes!!!!
Buy the game and there is nothing really to do in there unlesss you buy the cards to play with... well even that is not enough, pay to play ranked constructed..... no progression either...
No one thought about players when making this game.
Trading card game where cards are untradable but marketable.
Tax collecting card game. :)

Matches are too long. 
A single match can take anywhere from 20-50 minutes.
might as well just play a match of dota2.

No player interactions despite being a multiplayer game.
No emotes, no profiles, no rankings, no levels. 
Your opponent may as well be an AI, and it wouldn't affect the gameplay.

Gameplay:
The game simulates the 3 lanes in dota. 
I hope that there will be a mechanic where the battles dont have to start from the left lane every time. Maybe roll a dice to decide which lane to start.
This is a very unique card game, and it's fun as hell. And quite honestly, that's the sad part about it. 

What a lot of these ignorant critics don't understand is that this is more of an online TCG rather than a CCG, like Hearthstone or MTG Arena. Meaning that, like an actual card game, you have to buy the cards and packs you want with real money, or simply trade them... which you can't do... Thats right. You can't trade. Now, I can probably understand why, seeing as how this is an online game, and people can just boost one account by trading with fake accounts and whatnot. But seriously, I can't dump more money into this game other than the initial $20 purchase, which is also insane, even from Valve's prospective. Why have a game where in game purchases are necessary, but you wall off potential buyers with a price tag on the game itself? If the game was free, and everyone started with the same starter deck or something, then the cards would be worth dirt on the market. Or even just market lock the cards you start with so there is no free profit for the consumer. I don't get it, I really dont. I would be content if there was just some other way to earn cards or packs other than doing well in events.

This would be a very good game to recommend, but I just can't. How would I even recommend it to sombody AND get them invested without avoiding the whole "you're gonna need hella money" thing.
I don't recommend it if you are a casual player as you will need to put a ton of time into the game, but if you like TCG's and have lots of time I would say you will enjoy this nuance card game.

This game is for players that are looking for hardcore, deep strategy game.
It takes a tons of hours to get used to UI, understand different mechanics and to get used to the game system.
It is more like a board game then a card game.

Pros and cons from my perspective.

TL;DR:
- :
* Complicated UX/UI.
* Long games.
* You need to invest alot of time to get used to mechanics.
* High-bar of entry.
* Too dark visually

+ :
* Lane fighting! - should be implemented in a better card game.
* Free drafts.
* Market place.


Minusses - :
* UX / UI is terribly done, very chaotic. Alot is going on the screen, sometimes with many informations.
* Games and turns are very long. Ton of time needs to be put into a single match.
* Super complicated for newcommers which will discourage any casual players. High-bar of entry.
* Lack of good indicators when your turn starts. I usually have few times per game where me or my opponent realised it is his turn by indicator saying it is 15 seconds left. It makes games even longer.
* For me cards look blunt. Heroes are somewhat fine, but other cards are still hard to read for me.
* I dont like most of the visuals. Too dark for me.

+:
* Fighting in a lane has a really good feeling to it. Playing cards and countering one another plays before resulting an action is a super good concept (it is super fun) and should be implemented in a better card game. This mechanic is the best part of the game which makes me still play it.
How it works: Players play cards one at a time on each side similarly to Gwent. It is quite cool because it leds to countering one anothers actions. It reminds me of yu-gi-oh game when players activates their 5 trap cards chaining them together resolving in a big action. It is pretty cool.
* Free drafts where you can practice.
* Market where you can sell or buy cards.
I was really looking forward to playing Artifact but it was so boring that I barely made it to 1 hour before falling asleep in my chair. This "game" needs a tremendous amount of work to be considered an entertainment product. Luckily you can request a Refund as long as you don't "Accept" the starter pack bundle for free that follows the 2 training scenarios.
STAY AWAY!

This game has GREAT potential. . .It if it was free, I would suggest it. with the current "economy" it’s not worth the price tag. I would be more apt to purchase in game packs if it was free. it is more pay to win than hearthstone and arena combined. (and with those two at least you get gold for daily goals)

Currently I don't recommend it, you start with ten packs and 5 vouchers, you can draft to win decks with vouchers but you have to be really good and Extremely lucky.
I find a single game against an AI or person takes way too long. Near the end of the round I’m bored and want to concede or do something else
The drafts seem wrong to me, I played other people that had cards WAY above anything I even saw in my draft. (some people had multiple of cards that were insane)

wait until they fix the economy (ADD SOME DAILY QUESTS!!!!) or add a free dlc or just make it a free game.

**UPDATE**
So you don't keep cards on phanton draft. A complete waste of time. I would refund this game if I hadn't just spent all those hours learning how poorly put together this game is. WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY

STAY AWAY from this game until it has been updated unless you are willing to drop A LOT of money.  Casual is fine until you get bored of playing for NO REWARDS.

The drafts you play with tickets still seem fixed,  I somehow come across people with INSAINE decks with cards I never got to see in any of my drafts. (Almost makes you think they are AI, cause I know I don’t suck that much)

The game needs a grind, some sort of daily goals or reward system. I’m not dropping a few hundred bucks just to be competitive. I am done with this game until it is updated/fixed.
Artifact is a beutiful, innovative TCG. Too bad the vast majority of people won't get to enjoy it. 

Once you have opened your 10 packs to find a mish mosh of cards that you may be able to turn into a sub-par deck, or one of the 2 pre-made decks, that you can take into constructed with your 5 provided tickets. Once you quickly find that your sub-par deck is just that, or that most people are running decks that do well against the pre-mades, you'll move to draft. Being that you are new to the game, you can't quite be sure what consitutes a good deck, so you take the "best" cards you can, just to find that you're ideas of good were not as good as you though.

Out of packs and tickets, you are left with a few choices:

1. Spend money. The easiest option. Just buy more cards/tickets. Sooner or later you'll get the great cards you see others with. This is the best way to fix your issue, but most people report spending $300+ and still not getting enough to make the top tier decks.

2. Sell/buy cards on the Marketplace. The open market is a great place to round out your deck. But, if you don't want to spend your money, you have to sell cards first. The next issue rears it's head. If you are trying to sell something that isn't a top tier rare, you are averaging .01-.06 with small spikes in the middle. For compairison sake, I sold all my cards when I backed out of the game. Sans the Axe that I got (~18.50), all my cards combine sold for $5.57 USD. This is not sustainable for someone looking to spend as little as possible.

3. Modify cards into tickets. You could take 10 of your worst cards or your duplicates and turn them into event tickets. This is a great use for duplicates if you don't want to sell them on the market. IMO, this is the only viable option for sustaining a F2P mindset in this game. But, you fall into the hands of Lady Luck once again, since if you lose that ticket in the same way as before, you will need to start canibalizing your decks.

4. Accept your fate. If you don't want to do any of the above solutions, then enjoy casual and social play. There is no in game progression system that can help sustain a F2P mindset. Just some casual modes that yeild no real value other than playing the game.

This brings me to my point. Artifact isn't a F2P game. You bought it. There is no option to play for free. So, why do we expect it. Because pay to play doesn't work in a digital card game.

In a physical card game, there are many ways other than packs for a casual player to get cards that are not as "throw you to the sharks" as Arftifact. Trying to make a deck out of the cards given is a near-impossible task, placing you up against your lack of knowledge and the lack of a knowledge base to try and figure out what consitutes a good game. "Is it better to lean in on one win condition?" "Should I go mono-color or mix in others?" "Can I do a 3 color deck?" "How do these mechanics interact?" Nothing is learned easily. 

Moreover, I feel no need to keep playing. I'm in no way incentivised to continue playing casual modes with my bad decks. Nothing about playing these bad decks is going to make me better. Nothing about playing these bad decks is going to improve my winning odds. All that happens is I get matched against much better (and more expensive) decks. Any idea of finding a playstyle that works for me is gone. I'm expected to either play one of the two easily counterable pre-made decks, or flounder while you try and learn the game with your own bad deck.

This is going to be a game for the highfalutin gamers. Those with cash to burn. Without a sustainable reward system, I don't see this game setting the world on fire.
bad game from greedy company with terrible monetization system, poorly built game modes, and lack of progression.  

spent 80 on exclusively cards, got 25 back when I sold everything. cards don't really retain much value like gabe claims. 









Gameplay is alright but I can't recommend paying for the game in its current state. It feels more like a closed alpha test than a finished game from a triple A company, lacking content and even things as simple as a ranked play option.

Hearthstone's release was amazing. The base set of cards were interesting and had a lot of character to them. Comparitively, this game's release leaves a lot to be desired.

They do seem to be updating the game very frequently, so I'd keep an eye out though.
Bought the game, played for about an hour (the two intro matches) and opened my cards, looked at deck building.  Didn't care for the game, especially once I realized that it was a Pay to Win game.  Ask for a refund with about 65 minutes of playtime and get told "NOPE" because I opened my cards up.

Word of warning, unless you want to spend lots of money to be competitive, don't buy this game.  Play Hearthstone or something else where you don't have to buy the game for the privilege of giving them more money so you can then be competitive.

Waste of money, waste of time.
Played for a while. Too broken, too expensive, etc. You get 10 free packs to start with, cool. 5 tickets to try your luck in competitive, cool. Once you run out of tickets though, it's pay to play from there. 1.99 a pack of cards. No more freebees. 

Already paid 20 for the game, not enough content to pay any further right off of the bat.
I wanted to like it.  I really did.  I was a huge MTG fan back in the day.  the 3 lane setup is kinda frustrating.  Not that its hard or difficult to figure out.  Its just not really fun.  Some of the mechanics are pretty cool, but the overall layout of the game board just does not do it for me.  Games seem to take forever too but its probably not as long as it seems.
can't get a new card from playing the game. I already buy a game should i buy a card to get a new card? really valve? I buy this game to play for fun not to waste my money for card
No communication company 
This game is fun but valve is suck
No update for this game and valve will shutdown artifact because it’s unpopular
don’t play this game 


Congratulation to bad history of valve
Good gameplay. Would love to play it more. Valve is happy they got $20 out of me though i bet! It's just not worth the money to keep playing... I liked it too. Competitive card games are stressful enough already i don't want this paywall man. Literally pay to win );
Edited after 12/21 update, verdict is still largely the same.

TLDR; In its current state, I can't really recommend this game.  I think there is some merit to the core game, however it remains deeply flawed in its current state.  I look forward to valve trying to get me back in the game in 6 months after their player base has disapeared.

Pros:
* Effectively captures the moba feel, with heros, ganking down the river, and buffing your champions to rage quit strength.
* The 3 lanes, similarly to your typical moba style map adds a little depth to the CCG realm.
* `Lock` was an interesting new mechanic (for me anyways), which delays your opponents to play certain cards.
* Visually very satisfying.

Cons.  Lets get this started:
* Very slow progression of cards with out spending $$.  Others have mentioned this. I agree that it blows.
* It feels like there are not a lot of cards.  For example, blue only has ~5 creatures you can play..
* It does not feel like there is a lot of card synergy.  Perhaps I am just not that familiar, but sticking the best cards you own into a deck seems like the breadth of the strategy.
* From DOTA, this game inherited its incredibly long game length.
* No mobile client.  I mostly play CCG's on mobile.
* I would buy cosmetic changes, but the board seems so intricate that I have a hard time imagining them releasing any sort of quantity of variety.
*  Single player mode does not contribute to ones advancement and collection of cards.
brfore playing--MIND BLOWN SO HAPPY!@ TY TY TY FIRST VALVE RELEASE IN FOREVERRRRRRR

PAY TO WIN - buy op cards and you too can win against my super inexspensive yet very cleverly constructed deck. GODDAMNIT   BLUE IS BROKEN **** blue



LORE AND ART AMAZING -----love that part can just listen to lore all day : so its better for that than a card game RIGHT NOW>
It's hard because I really do enjoy this game quite a bit. There are a lot of great things which many people have already covered, but the issues are glaring and distracting to the point that it is honestly almost not worth continuing play of the game. First and foremost most people are going to expect me to mention monetization and I don't really care about that at all. It's a card game and card games costs money, and this is cheaper than magic and more accessible (insofar that I don't have to go somewhere and play magic with a bunch of smelly, socially inept people.) The glaring issues are that the random elements of the game do not lend themselves to this sort of card game. It's lazy and very unelegant. You can lose turn 1 of a draft because of the way minions line up in lane. Coming from the world of boardgames a lot of people talk about random mitigation, and the fact is that there is little to no counterplay to most of the random elements of the game. You can buy a gold ticket, get an OP item and finish on turn 3 rather easily. That is a major issue and makes the game non-competitive.
Warning:  As soon as you play the tutorial there is dialogue that if you accept the packs that come with the game you cannot return it.  Wasted $20 on this game with no refund option because I didn't read this fine print.  As far as the game goes, this might be the most beginner unfriendly card games on the market.  I wouldn't purchase it unless you are a MTG vet who really wants a more complicated card game.  If you are just a Hearthstone player looking for something with a little more depth, I'd look at other options that you can play for free before buying this.
Id set this on Neutral if possible.
Its a fun game but some features are missing and some mechanics are terrible.

The fact that the oppening flop is completly random while you draw random cards from your deck (because its a card game duh) without a muligan, makes this game way to random.
You can lose all 3 heroes in the first round just because of the coin flip. You can draw only high mana cards and wont be able to do anything for 2-3 rounds.

Some rng mehanics like Bounty Hunter 50% coinflip to kill certain heroes, or Cheat Death make the game unfun in my opinion. There should be as little as possible rng in a card game and artifact has to much.

Certain heroes are way to strong and some are pretty much unplayable. There are some who have great stats, a great ability and a great signature card and some that suck in all 3 areas. 

The missing features are challenge friend to a draft.
Spectate a friend and chat with your opponent.

i hope they will improve the mentioned aspects in the future
fully enjoying draft and the quality of animations and skill involved is a great time eater on my days off

was my first review but after many hours i came to the conclussion certain cards are far to strong with no real counter such as time of triump and all allies damage immunity cards leading from clean wins into horrible rng mess
Edited after playing for a number of months.

I initially liked the mechanics, the slower play, the more thoughtful strategy.

But all that goes out the window when your units decide to RNG attack the same creep at a critical point and 35 damage becomes 2.

You can't play around that, you can't plan for it, your opponent didn't do anything to make it happen as it was an RNG creep.

It's not every game, but it happens enough that games you win or lose like that are horrible.

Sorry but the design of this game has some serious mechanical flaws for experienced play.   I'm out.
There is no way to get additional cards except buying booster packs.  It is not worth $20 to pay more money as the only way to get more cards.  WARNING: If you open the in-game packs Steam won't let you return even if you have an hour of play time.  This is also a terrible policy.
There's a lot of potential here, held very far back by awful monetization and highly questionable card balance. As it stands, I can't really recommend it - keep an eye out for the Artifact Reborn LCG in a year or two, hopefully.
If at any moment during the evaluation of this game, you wondered if it was going to be a bit too expensive, then you should avoid this game full stop. It's not that it's prohibitively expensive from the getgo. It's that the whole business model is geared towards punishing players for trying to get anywhere in it.

No matter how good you are, winning a draft run will set you back IRL money. With very high skill and luck, you can come out ahead with expert constructed, but this means investing enough cash to get some really good cards. Because there is simply no attempt to make each card reasonably balanced, and playing with subpar cards means you simply lose most of the time. The discrepancies in strength and functions for the best cards versus the more common ones are just too wide. We're not talking marginal benefits here, we're talking "start the game and you've already lost at least a hero on the first round".

The presence of RNG actually exacerbates the situation, as you can't plan for a lot of the moves the game will force you do to (e.g. positioning your units at the start of the game). So fielding better heroes will give you a significant statistical advantage.

Honestly, I was eager to get into an interesting card game but they just pushed this one too far. Best of luck.
You have to pay to play the competitive modes. There is no ranking or progression in the game, so nothing you do matters. The gameplay is fun, but becoming good at a game where i have to pay money to even play competitive isn't worth it.
Complete garbage of a CCG.  Couldn't get a refund since I played +2 hours.  Which is very little time to become familar with the mechanics of this CCG.
Nothing about this game is intuitive...NOTHING.

They introduced to many mechanics from the start, which means it has a lot of cards, which also means it's to hard to follow and watch anyone else playing it - the only way to learn it is to play it and it's not fun to play either...

Why are spells mitigated by armour? 

The game is not balanced at all - some heroes can't be killed at all(Axe) while others can be one shoted in the first round...not to mention Time for Triumph, this card should be atleast 10mana to play and only castable on 1hero... 

Why are you allowed to play as many cards as you want while the other player can't play any, and vice versa?

Heroes distribution is so annoying with its randomness... I understand that you can't choose exactly what your hero attacks in the lane, but at least let me chose what lane the hero goes... and random targeting every round also can cost you a game that should be won - "if only the hero whould have attacked the tower instead of attaking that basic creep..."

Also, stop taking control of my camera... add that option.

People seem to play because they think there is going to be a 1mil tournament - which is unlikely when it has less views on twitch then MTG...
Had to update my review from positive to negative.

The core mechanics of the game are well design, but there's a number of glaring issues that just make the game not fun to play. They could certainly be fixed, and who knows, maybe some day they will be but at this point, valve's method of never communicate anything has completely soured the game for me.

At this point, Id recommend magic arena (I've enjoyed it way more than I ever did artifact, unfortunately).
Valve doesn't need the money like a smaller company does and they're going to make their bank whether we all hate it or not. If theres not a reason to play every so often for some small reward in the hopes of maybe getting a new card, theres really no reason to play at all. Unless you have a group of friends or are part of a community that is all-in on playing this, save your money.
It sucks that there is a pay to win aspect to the game, but the gameplay itself if phenomenal. I'm not a big fan of card games, but decidided to give this a shot. Don't think of the 20$ as buying the game, think of it as purchasing 10 starter packs, which is really what it is. Also, I've beaten people with obviously paid for decks, and it felt pretty good using what I got initially. I'm leaning on a slightly positive side on this review. However, If they do add in a few weekly challenges to get a free starter pack, this game will be so much better for casuals like me.

*****
After playing this game for over 10 hours now, I can certainly say this game does in fact need weekly challenges and player interactions to stay fresh and fun. If not it will get stagnant.

*****
I can no longer recommend this game unless they plan to bring out some form of progression
*****
Update, they've addressed and fixed my complaints. Get it

=====
Alright. at this point I'm gonna not recommend it again. It's stagnant now. The matchmaking is trash. Probly becuase only high level people are still playing. Don't even try to do the competitive unless you're well seasoned or are masochistic. You'll get get dumped on by high level people. Maybe if there was a story mode or something for people to progress and get more cards from. Even gwent has that and it's F2P.
The major gripe with the game is the inability to progress past a certain point / skill level without paying for the cards needed to facilitate higher levels of play, a lesser gripe that personally affected me is that the game is very CPU intensive, and I dont mean its intensive for what is a simple card game,  I mean its more intensive than most games from any genre. While my graphics card is high end (GTX 1080 TI)  my processor is damaged and so is effectively a low end CPU. It still runs most games albeit some of them recieve choppy to low fps, while others run without a hitch. Artifact on the other hand allowed me to do the tutorial with stuttering animations, and as soon as the tutorial was complete the game crashed.  Not the end of the world,  I could just relaunch it and continue, or so I thought,  it seems something about the main menu absoloutely tanks your CPU to the point where I could not get past the Source2 intro video, I have tried editing config files to lower settings to the absolute minimum and using steam commands to skip the intro vids and the likes but to no avail. While I can run FPS games,  and games such as Star Citizen which is renown for it performance issues with little to no issues / fps drop,  I cant run a card game at all. 

The remainder of the review is based on my experiences on a different computer with a fairly high end CPU. 

You will get 10 free booster packs at the start of the game,  from that point on it os purely pay to win.  The only way you can earn free packs is by winning 3+ games in draft without losing 2 games before winning your third.  Even then the only way to enter these drafts is to use 2 tickets,  which, you guessed it,  costs real money to get.  Otherwise you can get the tickets by the same process as the boosters.  So basically if at any point in the time you play draft you must win 3 games before you lose 2 or you will never be able to earn cards again without paying for them. 

If you could grind for boosters / tickets it wouldn't be so bad, but unless you net the best cards in the game on your first 10 boosters then get used to losing to people with deeper pockets. Its a shame because otherwise the game itself is enjoyable but not worth shelling out constantly to keep up with the meta as it changes. 

Hopefully Valve will introduce some way to grind for boosters due to community backlash,  but it seems there are enough people willing to pay out that it could carry the game. 

TLDR: As far as games I have played go,  this is the absolute worst example of pay to win and it has serious performance issues for low end computers.
I keep get freeze screen in tutorial 3 time in differenrt progresses
The game is good...... but the tech problem can't let me finish one game I feel so sad
I'm a great limited format fan, so I was hoping for some nice building/dueling action.
I feel disappointed.
- Games take too long and get boring. Last rounds are too often decided by RNG (random positioning, top decks)
- There is no point of playing beside pure "playing for fun", no rewards, no quests, no ranking, nothing
- Grinding new cards are close to impossible
- Graphic is distracting to me, too flashy
+ It's new game ;)
I'm sorry to say that this game just isnt... fun. It has no zing or the instant satisfaction of heathstone. Waiting for turns to happen and for things to play out is like a watching pachinko machine.  Its not very clear what will happen and it just falls into place. 
I think they modeled the game too closely after dota and it just doesn't translate that well.
Also I keep hearing how good this game looks and the imps are certainly nice but the card art is drab and boring imo.
Although I don't fault them for making us pay for the game and the ability to trade is nice having no log-in rewards, missions or any other way to get cards just makes this game not at all compelling for me to play as I just don't enjoy the gameplay enough.
This game is going to crash and burn in a month for these reasons I think.
Pro:
It is fun. 
You can draft for free.
You can play decks that you do not own in bot games.

Con:
You can never get free packs or free cards. Literally impossible.
All competetive modes are locked behind real life money.


It is strange. You can have a blast if you do not value your money.
Short version:
- Horrible monetization
- Slow and tedious gameplay (matches take over half an hour without anything interesting happening)
- Unnecessary rng elemets in attacking, creep summoning and the item store make the gameplay even more rng than hearthstone.
- "No-nerf" policy means that broken cards stay broken and the metagame is not getting fixed.

It seems that most of the negative reviews focus on the atrocious monetization model, so one would think the game itself might be good if valve bothered to fix that. WRONG. The "game" itself is even worse. They did quite a good job of replicating Dota mechanics in a card game format. The question they forgot to ask was whether that should have been done in the first place. All these mechanics might work well as a representation of what is happening in dota, but from the gameplay perspective they just add more unnecessary elements that makes the gameplay more tedious and random.
I have to wonder what went on in the minds of developers when they were trying to make a game that is skill-intensive (or at lest more skill-intensive than HS) and end up adding a bunch of random mechanics (creep spawning, direction of attack, store, hero spawning are all deccided by randomness). The base-gameplay has more random mechanics than HS. Admittedly, some of this randomness is not win-or-lose like in HS, but more like "now I have to do this instead of that". Still, it's only "some". There are plenty of examples of bad rng - "50% of creatures in lane surviving lethal damage"... These types of effects were one of the reasons I stopped playing HS.
If it was simply monetization and rng-elements, then I would have some expectations that valve and Garfield might fix those things a bit or at least mitigate them. I actually went in the game fully expecting both of those elements, so that was not what made me drop the game. The worst part of the game is the worst sin any video-game could commit: it's tedious and boring. Games take over half an hour with sometimes full turns go by without anything happening on the board. By focusing on replicating the mechanics from Dota, they forgot to make the game actually fun.
its an ok game, but i'm not sure why they think its worth it to pay for everything. you can draft for free, but you cant build a constructed deck without paying wayyyy too much, so i guess if you like drafts then go for it?
I have been following Artifact very closely, I knew that economy was bad and the mechanic were good... but O god saying mechanic were good was a bit too early. It felt slow, unintuitive even a bit confusing at time, it felt weird I didn't understand why? I have been playing card game for year (virtual and physique) but never felt that confusing about why I lost... until I realise balance was off and sometime you just lose because of bad balance and rng in early game. 
But hey, maybe I'm just not that good and need to play more.
BUT let's say their is no balance issue, the economic model is bad not because of card pack or market but come on 1$ each time you want to play expert? isn't that a bit too much? why not just a free ladder... like every other card game.
1. It took me 30 minutes to realize this is PAY TO WIN AF.


2. I hope they change the nature of the game in the near future.

3. Game mechanics are good, but HP based heroes (most of them red) are too OP. 

4. Too many cards that don't do anything. Hard to make good strategies with basic tools. 

5. Animations are too slow, in a round 12 yesterday it literally took like 2 minutes to activaste all effectts, abilities, and otther stuff before we could even attack each other.

3/10

Hope it get's better.
Ok, once i have completed my training against bots the first opponent found steamrolled me with deck that would cost me around 20€ to copy. 

Seeing that kind of beginning im bound to change my review to not recommended. Not sure if its the MM i should blame or if the game is truly buy2buy2play or outright pay2win (since not everyone want to buy all the cards for the best OP combination to stay competetive).

Thats sad, cause the mechanics are great. The first pvp impression tho (complete steamroll with no way to respond to those paid combos) made my opinion of the game truly shuttered.

edit:
2nd opponent found, deck's worth: 58€...

Wonder what bought my 3rd opponent...

edit:
3rd opponent steamrolled by me, his deck cost for me: 0€
4th opponent steamrolled by me, his deck cost for me: 0€
5th opponent defeated me, his deck cost for me: 34€

I see a strange pattern here. Whenever i win, opponents have same decks as I do: nothing required to pay to complete their deck. Whenever i lose or get steamrolled, opponent's deck is always worth over 20€. 

If thats not pay2win, then i dont know what is. :)
The most powerful card is credit card(Copied).

Read the review before buying this game. Aspecialy bad review it will give you some good idea.
and
if you buy this game for play any card you want to play to win, forget it.
[h1] My first impression of that game was " That is way to complex!"  and "Holy shit this is epic" [/h1]

After my first hours playing this game I can say, it's not. Don't get me wrong it is harder than other card games like HS or GWENT. But its easier to understand than MTG. Overall there are some good and some bad things in the game, I want to inform you guys. 

The good aspects
[list]
[*] The atomsphere in that game is just stunning. The design aswell as the music gives the game an extraordinary feeling!
[*] It's not that long! As a dota player I just know games that are avg. 30~ min long, so this is a nice way to have fun without much time!
[*] There are lots of different option what you want to play. You compare that too hearthstone and I allways appreciate stuff like that
[*] The idea of TRADING, gosh this is sooo nice! Its just like MTG, just on the steam store!
[/list]
The bad aspects:
[list]
[*] Card packs are too expensive. Yes you get 10 Starter packs, but I don't think that's enough.
[*] There is defenitly a kinda P2W aspect! Its obviouser as in HS for example.
[*] There are no ways expect to win tournament modus. And that is a really bad for a person who just wants grind. 
[*] And the last point. The event tickets got too much impact! It's crucial if you lose those.
[/list]
[b] conclusion [/b] 
I think it has one of the biggest potentials when it comes to competitive gaming, but as a casual player it is not ready yet.


I wish I could give this game a neutral review. The core game itself is amazing but I feel that the buisness model actively damages the game and I believe this applies whether you think the price is reasonable or not.

If you come from non card-game video-games the price of this game is ludicrous. For the $20 buy in, you get to play phantom draft and free events. If you want to play constructed you need to either gamble on packs, or buy cards from the marketplace to build a deck. Only a few commons and uncommons are priced at more than a dollar and most of them are less than 25 cents, so getting all of them that you need for a deck is pretty reasonable at the moment. The real cost of a deck is getting all the rares you need. While it is true that the average rare only costs a couple of dollars, if you want to make a tier one deck, you will need to buy some of the expensive "chase rares" like Axe and Time of Triumph. Just getting a playset of those two cards will cost you more than $40 at the time of writing this review. If you want a complete set of every card in the game get ready to dish out more than $300.

Still, if you are coming from the likes of Magic the Gathering this is a much more reasonable alternative pricewise. I pesonally think that this game costs way to much for what it offers, even if it is the most polished card game ever made. Valve could have given players every card in the set for the $20 buy in and still have made stupid amounts of money off this game. They could then have just sold cosmetics and they wouldn't even have needed to charge for new expansions. Just like Dota or CS:GO. The only reason this game is so expensive is because it is a card game, even though card games are some of the cheapest video games to produce.

What really bothers me about the buisness model isnt the overall price of the game, however. Because they have chosen this buisness model they have intentionally prevented this game from ever being balanced. They intentionally print overpowered "chase rares" like Axe and Drow Ranger to make the game cost more. On top of that, they will not nerf cards unless they are used in almost every single deck because they do not want to anger players by devaluing their purchases. I know that it is impossible to achive real balance in a card game. There will always be power level tiers in a game like this. However, this buisness model exaggerates the differences in power to a massive degree. Cards like Outworld Devourer will never see play, and they will never be buffed to a playable state. Cards like Axe will see play in every single deck of their color until they are replaced by a stronger card or rotated out.

This game will never be balanced without drastic changes. This is why I am giving this game a thumbs down instead of a thumbs up event though the core game is amazing.

However, I would RECCOMEND this game if:

 - You just want to play unlimited free draft mode after a single $20 buy in. This is why I purchased the game myself.

 - You want to play constructed and you are fine with spending $50 - $100 on a single deck plus more to keep that deck updated everytime a new set comes out. The game is good enough to play right now even if I don't like the current balance.



TL;DR
Core game is amazing.
I don't like the buisness model because the cost is extreme compared to other video games.
I don't like Valve's stance on balancing.
The game is great, but...
...you cannot earn some kind of level
...you cannot earn some kind of ingame-money for new card
...you only gain things with your credit card
All in all the best game for my creditcard
It's a card game.
It's nice, flashy and fresh.
IT'S also P2W! And only p2w.
Every game mode that rewards new card packs costs money to enter. And you need to win to get the reward. 
So either you have money to throw at pixels or you are a really good/proffesional player.

Not recomended.
PS. If you open the 10 free packs you get when you buy the game you can't refund it.
Woah; look at this awesome refund policy "Yes, the Epic Store will offer refunds — initially through customer support, though an automated, 14-day, no-questions-asked return policy should follow soon."  Great Idea!
Game is overall really fun. Games tend to last a little longer than I think is necessary, it can get boring at times. The real downside to this game, that I think holds it back most, is that there is no way to earn cards or really progress without spending money in addition to the cost of the game. Hopefully they add modes to earn cards for playing matches, otherwise I dont see the game lasting/getting too widespread.
Game is full of microtransactions and some really non-interactive gameplay. You can't manually position heroes when they respawn, so if you're facing a large attack, it's up to RNG whether or not you'll block the biggest creature. Too much RNG, not enough strategy. Quite upset I wasted $20 on this game. Avoid.
I feel like I cannot recommend this game to someone. It's amazing, wonderful card game, but the monitzation method and the lack of things to actually do in the game makes this game really not worth the microtransactions necessary to enjoy the game to its fullest. The ticket system is a cool idea, but poorly implemented as it's impossible to get any tickets in the other than through money, or essentially money equivents through recycling cards in a 20 to 1 ratio of cards to tickets. with cards being only found in packs, at $2.50 for 10 cards, or $2.50 for a ticket. 

If this game had some form of progession, some kind of quest system, or something that encouraged continued playing then this would may be worth the money, but so far with the time invested as is and $140 (and no, it's not enough to own the complete collection of cards), I feel like I have wasted my money and time and should just go back to playing dota. I really hope that they improve the game with more things to do, and make the money I've invested into it so far worth it. At the moment, it's definantly a game to pass on if you're on the fence.
The game mechanic are fun and learning curve seems steep if you are willing to play for a few months/years.
However the microtransaction system in this game are over the top. If it was for any other game developer (EA, Activision, etc...) the community would be up in arms against the game, but somehow Valve is given a pass. 
If you want to play this game for a few hours a day in the ‘interesting’ mode, be willing to pay a few 100 dollars a month

There is no way to earn ingame currency by playing. And you can only access the challenging mode after paying a few dollars (2 loose or 5 win and you are out and need to pay again).

I have only played during the first week, and already in the free mode if you opponent even feel he may lose, he just quit to start a new game. No insensitive to try hard in free mode.

I completed a perfect run draft, received no reward and have not really any other insensitive to play. Game was fun, but not worth it full price.

Pro:
Fun mechanic
Lot of choice per turn

Cons: 
You need to pay to play
Lot of RNG, which can be frustrating
No social aspect to the game as of yet
If you are goal oriented as me, there is nothing to do currently. No ladder, no stats, no quest etc…
This game is shit until Cheating Death is removed.. Will not recommend this garbage game until they nerf it or remove it. Lost 4 games because of a card enabling a creature/hero to live with 1 hp off of a 50/50. It saved 3 minions and 3 heroes 9 times (Would have won the lane if any of the minions died). Which caused me to lose. Great game design.
I gave it an hour and I never felt like I was on top of it. Games feel like they take too long compared to other ccgs, despite the huge amount of mechanics it still feels like balance is more based on RNG, and also I dislike the little imps sitting on the decks and flying around and I really wish I could turn them off. They're sort of an eyesore.
I refuse to believe this game was built by human beings, everything about it screams alien, inhuman, nothing feels natural, the voiceovers are frighteningly annoying. I can't even describe how bad they are, how bad the writing is, it's some of the most base speech I've ever heard in a video game, it's not... real.... it can't be. Also, the biggest turn off for me, and it'd have to be a big turn off considering how much I hate the voiceovers, is that there's no progression. Nope. Win a 50 minute game? Nice job. Back to the menu? Nothing. Nothing at all. If you like strategy games for the sake of strategy and can handle insane dialogue, then hell, this game might be for you.
Absolute garbage.... Players get too long to decide on shit and then ontop of that they have to be DC'd for a solid 5 minutes before you get the autowin... half the game is a copy of hearthstone anyways so valve can suck a dick i'll be asking for a fucking refund on this aids piece of shit
Edit 1/26/2019:
Artifact is dying off and Valve has maintained radio silence. I definitely wouldn't buy in to the game in its current state. Wait for a major patch.

----old review----


The negative reaction to Artifact's monetization is overblown. For the up-front cost you get access to events and casual phantom draft, neither of which draw from your own collection. Arguably these modes are more fun than constructed which is currently plagued with samey hero-kill meta decks. 

If constructed is your style buying the exact cards you need for a deck is a lot easier and cheaper than usual — there is absolutely no need to gamble on packs, just buy exactly what you need off the market (usually for a few cents each).

The game itself is very complex and gratifying and the ability to play draft tournaments against friends for free is a big perk you don't see from contemporary online CCGs. If you're a strategy or ccg enthusiast your money will be well spent, and if DOTA 2's massive hero roster is any indication then Artifact still has a lot of content to come.
TL:DR Just go play Gwent if spending additional 30 bucks is someting u are not comfortable and you are not that into RNG to play draft (random cards and you pick 2 you like to make a deck later). 

The game itself is pretty well meh honestly. Its without any social feature or progression which tends to feel a lot roboty, You only get 10 packs (and you kinda need at least 8 to make a proper conststructed deck {proper doesnt equal strong} so you cant rly spend it on keepers draft) its a bit limiting to make good constructed decks. Game offers no ingame currency to use (unless you count inital 5 tickets to use for expert draft, but u have to buy aditional ticket if you lose those) and buying cards takes money. Sure most cards are really cheap but u need 3 of some in certain decks and the prices stack up. Why would you want to buy a game for 18euros and than be forced to pay aditonal 40 euros for a complete set of cards? (axe hero is extremly expensive around 20 which is like game itself) You can play draft which is basicly random but I suggest going to play Gwent honestly as it offers far more rewarding expirience
It's a shame that the monetary aspect of this game is so high. First you pay for the game, then you have to pay for every single card pack you want. I honestly cannot see myself spending $300+ on a digital TCG. When I play TCGs, I actually want cards in my hand that I can  trade and keep for long-term value. In Artifact, you won't get that. So it's trying to be a TCG without any of the real benefits of a TCG.

It's a real shame as the gameplay is quite good.
This card game is pure randomness and annoys me more than it is fun.

I can't decide where my heros are placed.
Sometimes my hero dies in the first round because of bad placement.
Sometimes the unit is attacking in front of him, sometimes it attacks diagonally.
If you have Axe and your enemy doesn't you practically win the game.
You have to pay to expand your collection.
There is no ranking System.
Even if you win a game it doesn't feel satisfying.

I WANT TO DECIDE WHERE TO PLACE MY CARDS, FFS!
WHY IS THIS GAME PAY TO PLAY AND PAY TO WIN? I ALREADY PAID 18 EUROS!
FIrst you spend +$25 for a game includes 10 packs of cards, then the only way to get more cards and heroes is to pay cash to earn more cards. literally pay 2 win
The game is terribly unbalanced, Red reigns supreme with green and black on it's coat tails, and blue left dead in a ditch somewhere in peru. Playing any sort of competitive in this game will yield nothing but frustration with the enemy getting their over stat boosted red heroes in perfect position to kill any hero that isn't red round 1. Round 2 is just clean up for whatever you managed to save by 1 health, and placing whatever hero you picked for your deck. Meanwhile the enemy is boosting the red stats even more with the end tier equipment they bought for killing everything. 

TLDR; I'm not the best at this game, but clearly red is best, and everything else loses.
> Can't refund
> Quick cashgrab
> Lets not forget about pay2win shit
> No difference between diablo immortal and this trash, same intention
> Fun for normies, some rewards here and there
Edit: since the servers on EU stopped shitting the bed or patch fixed something, I can actually play this game without disconnecting at least once per match and thus give this a positive review. The gameplay is actually pretty good, lots of small decision-making intricacies in comparision with your average children's card game. Great strategic depth, good draft mode.

I leave the old review as a reminder of the game's state at release and a cautionary warning about expecting a game to work on release day just because you paid for it:

"The game is plagued by disconnects that I have also seen other people complaining about, these can crash your game or cost you the match in a gauntlet that you paid a ticket to enter. You will be at a disadvantage every time you disconnect. You can lose your ticket to technical issues. You will not be reimbursed. You cannot refund the game."
I was hoping to replace hearthstone with this but the pay wall is just a NO. If you have a lot of spare cash and time then this is your game.
The games are looooonnnnggg. Min of 20 mins per match. The clash between cards is dull. Its hard to tell if your play is correct or not.

If you want a good card game thats free to play. download Eternal you wont regret it. 1000x better then this.

The only game in 30 years of playing i refunded.
This game is the best CCG I've ever played. The matches are always close, game feels awesome and the deck-building is done amazingly well. Why is my review negative you may ask?

Its the long term effects of Valve's buisness-plan. No, I'm not whining about everything costing money (its Valve we're talking about). I'm disappointed at the lack of clear progression in the game. The lack of ability to get cards by just playing deters casual players away and the low-budget competitive player also have a hard time building a deck they want. That only leaves a small portion of a playerbase, that are both competitive players and have the money to spare. And even then, the absence of a ranked game-mode or a ladder will leave the playerbase dying.

This game is the best CCG I've ever played and I don't want to see it dead.

Valve, please do something about it.
Do not buy this game if you are not going to spend more cash on in-game purchases, but if you do have the budget, you sure will have tons of fun in the experience. Upon first glance on this card game, I was stunned by its creativity and visual effects. The mechanic is innovative, and the variety in strategy and deck-building is absolutely amazing. I have played many mainstream card games like Yu-Gi-Oh, MTG, WS, Gwent, Shadowverse, Hearthstone...each for at least more than a year, and Artifact still has its novelty unseen in all the others.
But I do not recommend this game if you are a casual player.
There is no way to get free card packs, or any com in game. No daily missions or rewards of any kind, and you even have to pay for "tickets" just to play certain game modes that give you free card packs as a reward. I am just a new player who does not have many cards. I tried to build a deck after playing a few pre-built decks, but I barely have enough cards to build a playable one, and I cannot even "disenchant" extra cards to craft new cards. The only available option is to pay more cash. That was why I quit the game on the second day, after realizing this fact.
Some may argue that comparing with MTG, Yu-Gi-Oh or other TCGs, players spend relatively lower amount of money on this game, or some may say this is the inevitable price for playing card games, but those were the reasons why I quit many TCG games. And for Artifact, you pay $20 only for the entry ticket. Imagine before playing Magic, you have to pay this amount of money for the membership, and afterwards, you may start paying more cash on actual cards, which is ridiculous!!
But don't get me wrong, Artifact is indeed a superior card game that has the potential to be one of the best among its peers, yet the ridiculous additional cost for merely acceptable playability of this game render it an endless money pit.
Just a heads up I would avoid buying this game at the moment till the future since once you complete the tutorial they will not refund you because you opened their packs. There is a crash problem, not many have but enough to worry about. The game randomly will crash and steam won't let you instantly reboot it up, usually has to be fixed with a whole computer restart or waiting about five minutes. It is random when the crash happens, sometimes right after you boot up the game or even an hour later. If anybody reads or cares, will update the review if/when the problem is addressed/solved by valve :)
The game doesn't seem nothing special to me. Also strongly paytowin unless you are very lucky with drops or you stick to some specific game modes.
At this moment I suggest to skip this and try other games with better farming systems.
The game itself seems fun but the lack of F2P progression even level rewards makes for a very dull casual experience. The "expert" modes are too expensive. I'm not looking to play hundreds of dollars in drafts, overpriced.

Edit - Super fucking dumb game. Market restricted "No Recent Purchases".. I just bought the game. Honestly all the hoops to jump through just to get to some decent game play or build a deck is atrocious. Burn this and play a chinese clone in like 2 months.
If you use the market and not packs you can make a really good deck for cheap ( and ignore the two or three out of 40 heroes which are expensive) 

I didn’t do this, I realized too late and spent a ton of cash on decks. 

Still..... it’s a bloody good game and I enjoy it a lot . I would like a ladder or free ranked mode

EDIT: 
No communication, no decent updates, no playerbase, not worth it
Positive:
+ Fun interactions, the system allows for some really cool combos if you have the cards.
+ Polished look, theres a ton of cool detail in unit speech depending on what your facing.
+ Inbuilt system for buying and selling cards, makes selling duplicates and planning decks really easy.

Negative:
- No incentive to play casual modes, you don't get anything for winning/losing. No quests, no cosmetics, no leaderboards or even street cred from the opponent, nothing.
- Paid modes are costly, the best you can hope for as a new player is to win your buy in back. Yay.
- Games can last up to 30 minutes, if your deck is poorly equipped its a slow race to the finish.

Only reason to play casual constructed is to test your deck if your not feeling confident.
Paid modes have "rewards", however you have to spend considerable amounts of money beforehand to have decent odds at winning. Or you just gamble away in draft mode. Either way your reward is getting your "buy in" back, and if you are really good, 2 extra packs.

TLDR: if your a casual or a new to card games, this isn't for you.
I sold all the card
kinda SiHT game

50% Luck
40% P2W
10% Skill

50% Luck because you never know what card you gonna get first
40% P2W you need  rare card to win, those streames are lying.
10% Skill deciding which card to use, but still need that luck
What a money sink! Avoid until the whole system of getting cards is improved or end up like me :-50 euros in my account and with a  bunch of cards worth 20 euros on the market.
Played the tutorial- game is complicated as hell, boring to watch and very pay to play. After playing HStone and Gwent (both which I stopped now), and being a huge dota fan (3.5k hours ), this game is simply just disappointing and not worth your money or time. Refunded it- ensure you dont open the packs or you cant do so!
Like many other's, I made the mistake of assuming this game operated on the same model as all other games of its category.  That was clearly my mistake.  After realizing that I needed to throw more money at the game to create a working deck, I attempted to refund the game without success.  Certainly, this could be a great game.  There are lots of novel concepts.  The free drafting is pretty wonderful.  However, I bought into this game thinking it was something I could play casually for 20$, slowly accumulate cards, and even trade cards with friends.  I do not want to drop hundreds of dollars to make my deck.  The marketplace cut is just plain greedy.  It was clearly my mistake to place faith in valve here.  My mistake, but your bad review.
So far I'm enjoying playing this game, but after recent game crush I can't stand it anymore, valve please fix your issues before I can play again, until that I can't recommend this game unless you want to ruin your games in the middle of the battle. I lost few games because of this. very frustrating and dissapointing.
I bought in because I thought I'd like draft, but casual draft is not taken seriously.  The monetization model is gross. I regret the purchase.  I hope they can turn things around, because this was a total waste for me in its current state.
Refunded it right away, paying 18 dollars for the game and then you find out there's no f***** way of getting cards unless you pay more and more money. 
Valve yet again showed how money grabbing company they are, they managed to ruin dota completely, and after they sucked out all money from low brained dota players, it's time to make another money grabbing game which is impossible to progress without spending money.. 

I highly recommend you avoid this type of money leech...
It would be understandable that they charge for packs if the game was free, but no, morons at valve decided to charge you up, then make you spend some more.
And this is just a core game, wait for expansions ;)
APSOLUTE NO!
I cannot emphasize enough how fucking SLOW this game is. Everything has a lovingly rendered animation that is cute the first time and eye-rolling the hundredth time. Play a card? Wait for your opponent to slooooooowly decide what to do. Can't play anything in a lane? Too bad, you still have to click and awknowledge
every
single
action
your opponent takes.
Having each player play a single card at a time means there's also none of the fun moments in other card games where you reveal the play you've been leading up to and a bunch of your cards pop off at once.

There's also no progression to speak of, so you can just run the free draft over and over until you get good draws, then...play to get five wins in a row and start over.

There's a good game at the core of this, but I have yet to get out of a match and think "I had fun! I want to do that again."
the game crashes on startup without fail. tried every imaginable fix from comment sections, reddit, google etc. its not my hardware, going to have to refund.
It is a fun game, mostly well executed with just a few minor flaws. The 3 lanes are novel and managing your resources across all three lanes is a fun and rewarding balance. All that only adds to my disaapointment, though, that when you pay $19.99 for this game you do not get anything close to a full competitive card game experience compared to other genre standards. 2 starter decks and 10 packs will not make you a good deck, and thus the game becomes pay-to-win, since there is no way to get free cards. I would refund this game so fast if I could!
The game is really, really fun. Even the monetization model is honestly better than games like Hearthstone.

But that's not saying much, is it?

Just because it's better than trash doesn't mean it's amazing. The game is imitating the MTG model, which is outdated, greedy, and if that game got released now and not 25 years ago, no one in their right mind would buy it. Also, Valve has proven before that they know how to create a fair, free game with Dota 2 (which this is ironically based on). We should just expect more from them than this. Also, speaking of the MTG model, this game is actually worse than that - you cannot trade the cards (in this supposed TRADING card game), you can only sell them on the marketplace where Valve conveniently takes a 15% cut.

Also, because of the market system and because Valve want the cards to 'hold value', they have said they won't be doing almost any balancing of cards. Why is this even an online game then? Why are you not using the main advantages of the medium?

Other than that, the game is currently a bit sparse on features. While there is quite a few game modes, the social features are nonexistent, even though this is supposed to be a major part of the game. There is no chat (not even a Hearthstone style emote system) and while a tournament system is supposed to be a major feature, there is no way to find public tournaments.

Overall, the game is very fun, but dragged down by its greedy monetization and limited features.

Honestly, it's so much fun that I recommend that you  DO buy it... In a couple months, after the game ends up being a failure and Valve hopefully tries to fix it.
This is I believe the first review I have ever written but I feel like I need to throw it out there to vent. 

Artifact eventually could be a great game one day but right now I can't really recommend it. It's not even the monetization scheme thats off putting to me. I played MTG for many years, I'm used to having to shell out cash for tcg's. What I find most frustrating are some of the mechanic/design choices in Artifact. It has some of the super old school magic the gathering feel where you can just get shut out for several turns unable to do anything but stare at the board waiting for respawns. It's akin to old school combos in mtg where you wipe your oppenents lands. While a successful tactic its not fun to play against (or watch). The other complaint I have is how much RNG is in the game. Holy cow. It's like hearthstone 2.0. Not only do you have RNG on your draw. You have RNG lane minion deployment, RNG hero Positioning when redeploying... its a mess, and honestly completely unnecessary. I'm not sure why it was designed this way since the lead mechanics designer designed magic and magic has never been like that to my knowledge. 

At the end of the day I will say this. Artifact has great potential and if you aren't competive it's a pretty fun game to play. If you are though I wouldn't waste your time. If the monetization was different I would say it could be a good time sink. But at this point if you are going to throw money at a TCG and/or are very competitive just go play Magic the Gathering.
Do you like random effects? Enjoy playing bs card based casino? Adore losing on turn 1? Then this game is for you.
Random random randon random. Just sit and watch random roller coaster, while you press golden button on the bottom right handside.
Easily the most depth of any card game I've ever played. It has none of the random gameplay mechanics that stop Hearthstone and others from being a serious competitive game. Unfornuately its deeply let down by a lack of polish in game modes, no clear goals to strive for and no access to free progression in card collecting. I think these will be fixed though and could end it up being one of the flagship games for the genre. There needs to be a ranked mode with clear cutoffs and rewards for achieving certain ranks. Daily goals/quests of some description.  Observation modes. Rare/golden/foil versions of cards. The access to free card collecting does not need to be the primary way to complete a collection. Something like 1-2 packs per gauntlent event per two weeks would be enough to keep people playing, avoid flooding the market but still give an incentive for players to buy cards. Surely there could be more cross-promotion between DOTA 2 and Artifact aswell? 

I got very lucky with my first 20 packs so I managed to construct a mono-red face deck with Axe with about $5.00 additional bought cards. However most are unlikely to have been that lucky to have their original packs fit an archetype. I've enjoyed playing the deck but essentially I've won seven in a row of matchmaking and don't really have anything to strive for at the moment. That lack of something to aim for, combined with the fact that the only other way to play a different deck is to outright buy it, means I'm not going to keep playing in its current form. 

That being said, these problems are very fixable, very quickly. What isn't quick to fix is bad gameplay design and Artifacts gameplay is gorgeous and has miles of depth. Come on Valve, turn this around and show Blizzard how its done.
At the current state this game is not worth its initial price, forget about economy issues, while the core gameplay has a lot of depth and rewards well thought decisions its all ruined by overtuned cards and rng effects.
- Playing the game is pointless unless you are a content creator or trying to go competitive (esports/tournaments), while playing for fun is core to every game, that usually comes with some sort of goal to achieve or progress towards, nothing like that in this game.

Problem with the gameplay and overtuned heroes/cards :
- Casual draft is meant to train you on how to draft so you can start looking into expert draft play, however it just happens to show you how massive is the difference between drafting basic heroes and actual good ones,
- Heroes also add certain cards to your deck and said cards will be drawn when you start deploying them, easily enough that creates massive difference between tiers of heroes. 
- In order to succeed in draft all you need is high tier Heroes and their related cards, the amount of wins you are gonna get is very likely proportionated to how many insane heroes you draft.
- There are very few cards that are highly impactful and not related to heroes (time of triumph, annihalation, cheating death), that means that good heroes will carry each draft most of the time making pointless to question any pick outside of heroes pick.

Its true that the game has a very high skill ceiling and every game can be played in many different ways, however the amount of pointless rng ruins it completely.
- Rng deployment of first rounds, creeps and initiative (minor issue).
- Rng deployment of direction your creeps, heroes are attacking (very minor issue).
- INSANE game changing rng on cards such as Ogre Magi passive or Cheating Death or Bounty Hunter passive just as few examples (Absolute gamebreaking issues to levels that can easily surpass the worst hearthstone rng you can find).
- This game defeats any of his competitors when it comes to how important are the decisions you make, but then you throw it all away with unsatisfying coinflip.

When deciding wether to buy this game or not keep in mind that content creators have plenty of reasons to love this game, positive reviews from them are important but not as much as you think, money and time invested in the game for them is all worth, either as content or training towards competition, this wont be the case for you if you are just a casual player.

TL;DR : 
Game has not  a goal to achieve or progress towards, feels empty and pointless past the first day experience.
Gameplay has an unhealthy compromise between difficulty and casual effects.
Certain Heroes completely overwhelm drafts, making any card irrelevant compared to them.
Content creators reviews are biased, the game is simply not meant for you if you are never going to compete or make content on it.
I honestly can't recommend this Game. 
Why play simultaneously on three different Playmats? Guess this should be innovative, but it's just confusing.
Besides: Pay to win.
No Opportunity to get Boosters by playing, no Level-Ascension, no feeling of Progress.
Simply: Nope.
Overall it is a fun to play. Strategized CCG. 
Although with high luck needed.
Basically 1st turn with 3 8 mana cost cards in hand destroys the fun.

Preorder the game, turns out beta players have the advantage of gaining more cards in hand.
There's no other way to get new packs besides participate expert game with paywall and fully loaded players
I'd like to see some kind of daily quest system implemented like a lot of other online card games on the market do.
Why am I paying $20 for a game where I can't earn anything for free just by logging in and experiencing the game?
Why am I gambling money for draft wins and good cards from packs?

There's a really good game in here, but it's just not worth the money or the pressure of having to do well if you don't want to spend money (again, on a game you already paid for).
No way to earn cards without spending some form of money cripples this game from being excellent. Even some form of daily or weekly challenges to complete for a pack would improve accessibility and reduce the pay to win factor
One of the deepest card games I've played. Unfortunately, it's held back by a very volatile card market ATM and the lack of progression really hurts the game. In its current state I'd advise players to stay away.
It's pretty mediocre, at best. Sure, the monetization sucks in that you're either stuck with the same stuff you started with (or the call to arms packs... who knows how long those will be around?) or you're more or less forced to pay for cards. And most of the cards are cheap, but it feels weird and uninteresting to just buy most of the cards in the game... why bother with packs at all, then?

But really, the real let down is the game itself. There's not a huge sense of synergy between cards and a lot of the strategy has to do with managing lanes and hero respawns. Further, because of the way gold/itemization frequently influence the early- and mid-game, a great deal hinges on getting a strong opening hand. Hanging strategic decisions on this sort of more ephemeral long game makes a lot of the gameplay feel kind of ennervating, especially when a quick game takes something like 20 minutes and frequently you're looking at closer to 40. I'm absolutely sure that in a few weeks we'll all have the meta explained to us, but really, there's nothing here, no reliable moment-to-moment strategy and tension that makes this feel worth your time. I'm all for spending 40 minutes on an interesting, strategic card game, but this ain't it.

I don't know. It feels kind of amateurish, really. Like a bunch of money thrown at a conceit with not a lot of attention paid to how the thing actually plays.
Friend gifted it to me-- I do enjoy it a bit, but the RNG elements of the game are just too much.  The game can flex at any time just because of a single card draw.  I get that's sort of a point of the game, but it happens WAY too often with things added in aside from just a card draw (ex. multicast and other proc chances).  Wait for Valve to fix the game some more before getting (hopefully they'll add in an actual way to progress while playing too).
Until there is a way to actually move units around the board so you arent stuck as "the unlucky one that cant block units" its a ahrd no. disappointing just like the bad reveal at TI
This review once was positive, hoping for updates and such and I really had faith in this game because It's Valve, But no.

This game has more RNG than Hearthstone and there are many flaws with this game that I can't begin to list because there is many!
I spent over $150 in packs and gave it a fair playtime, but the game is too slow and I've lost a lot of times not because of the enemy being better but because of RNG. I have over 65% winrate due to spending $150 in packs and getting 90%+ of the cards and making a good deck.

Stay away from this game Ladies and Gentlemen.
Have you ever looked at chess and thought: "Damn, this needs to have more RNG and cost money every time you start a game"?

If so you will love Artifact, everyone else should probably avoid it.
The game is RNG fiesta. You get your starting setup, heroes and creeps, on the field randomly. Your stuff gets attack directions randomly. There are several random, 20-50%, cards. Not to mention, even the shop between rounds is random.

The game could be fun if you could have chose where to attack and where to place your stuff.

An other big issue is that you need to pay money to get into a tournament, where you can and will just lose to RNG. When your 19\5 satyr just refuse to attack the 4hp tower, while nothing is blocking him, but thinks it is perfect to help out the friendly neighbor, then you might rage a little.

Doesn't matter how good you are, If you don't have 80-85% winrate, you will eventually run out of cards and tickets. That means, you will need to pay again and again.

Only positive thing I can say is that the friendly duel is free... If you have a deck you like.
I don't mind a bit of grind to advance in a game but if the only way is through my credit card it's not a game, its a scam.

Edit since giving it a solid go after not getting a refund and feeling obliged to play it a bit: My orginal statement stands. A massive part of this game is collecting cards and building decks and this is hidden behind micro transactions. The community (other than those already financially invested / biased ) is going to wither and die before it has a chance to get anywhere as most folks won't pay to play a game they have already bought. Unintsalling for now, maybe valve will come to its senses before its a complete loss.
This is not like any other card game on the digital market. But you already knew that.

Since there is no in-game currency, you do not feel like you are gaining anything by playing. This makes it more like actual CCGs where you are just playing for fun and to get better at it. There is no reward for play other than that. You will not gain cards no matter how much you just grind playing. Your collection will ONLY grow with real money being spent.

So this model is either good for you or not. There isn't an inbetween. Starter Pack aside, coz hey maybe you wanted to try it out, if you are not prepared to dump money into packs and/or singles, then you should just avoid the game.

If you are willing to spend, then you will likely find a very nice game and can compete in the major events. This game is supposed to have massive $$ support. I am not willing to spend on it, I have enough digital and real card games as it is, I dont need a money sink.
The program shows a black screen while loading, and then it just minimizes playing sound. As far as I can tell, my computer meets the system reqs. This card game seems to be having a similar problem running as MTG Arena. Unfortunately, the game lacks support without any suggestions on how to adjust its graphics settings before launch or the like to make it work. Stellaris which is an infinitely more complex game works fine, but a card game crashes. 

If the game had support professionals to help with technical issues, this might get fixed soon. Maybe they would even be able to post some potential fixes. I have heard Valve does not employ people for support, so I will probably have to refund the game before ever trying it.

Edit: After 2 days I did receive a useful message from Valve pointing me to a number of support documents that proved useful. These support documents should be searchable from the support pages for the game. It turns out I needed to force -fullscreen on the game to make it work. I had been trying to find parameters like that for the product, but I was unable until searching into nested  pages that Valve support linked to me. 

I will now have to play the game some to see whether I like it.
PAY TO PLAY
PAY MORE TO WIN
OH YEAH!
DO  YOU HA HA HA HA HAVE MONEY?
O PEN YOUR WALLET LIKE YOU OPEN YOUR LEGS!
OH OPEN YOUR WAAA~~ LET FOR MeE like YOU OpeN Your LEGSSS FOR MEE!!

PAY MORE! PAY PAY PAY PAY! YES! WE PAY PAY PAY PAY!

OH MY BABY I love oyu! Just pay more !!!
Money, money, money, its pay to play and pay to win. Because there is no way to grind cards you are paying for any new addition to your deck. On top of that you can get the basic cards that aren't worth anything in a booster pack. 

It is fun to play but I was turned off by the pay to play aspect. It is not competative with any of the other cards games out there. Hell the online version of magic the gathering allows you to grind cards and build up resources to buy a specific card purely through grinding or doing daily challenges.
Yeah. Monitization for this game is really bad.

If you want 'any', and I mean literally any, progression in cards without spending money do not buy.

You get 10 packs after buying the game. Opening A SINGLE ONE will VOID your ability to refund the game. 

Stay away from this unless you want to spend lots of money on it. This is not meant for small spenders.
This is the worst Pay2win game I've ever seen. Aside from the 10 packs you get for buying the game, everything else must be purchased with microtranscations. There is currently no way to "grind" the full card collection without paying. 

As it is, this game is also far too influenced by RNG. And the variety among heroes is pathetic -- you basically need to run Axe + Drow in constructed. 

Don’t release half life 3 because it can’t live up to the hype.
Hype the shit out of artifact before release so it can’t live up to the hype. 
Valve logic.
No, Progression unless you pay to play, ontop of the 20$ game price. not my type of game thats for sure. The mechanics are fun but having 2 pay 2 bucks too play the competetive aspect is stupid. I won most of my casual games with some close ones, but at "Expert play" i got my ass whopped. not fun for free to play.
Amazing game but HOW you can play the game is fucking shit and you can't earn packs or anything, if you don't play draft which is going away soon you HAVE to Buy the game then BUY tickets AND packs to even PLAY!
Dota start with Dota  where you can pay to receive bonus, ok! But Artificat is really p2p (pay to play) because you need pay to farm cards it's sad :(... Big announcement but a Big disaster start the game like this....
Stay away, it's not worth your money or frustration.

Gameplay:
First half of the match doesn't matter what you do.  Lose a tower in three turns, dominate all lanes, doesn't really matter.  Mid-late game is just about spells and that is what you're playing for.  Got your hero to 20/5/20, still doesn't matter, what spells do you have?  There are so many ways to instantly kill a hero, move them to another lane, wipe out an entire lanes units, wipe out almost all enemy heroes, it's pretty crazy.  And this isn't just one color, Red, Black, and especially Blue all have great ways of destroying a lane instantly.  After a while you realize you're never "ahead" or "winning", you're just hoping that even though things look good the last three cards in the enemies hands don't immediately turn the game for them.  Sure in the begining you are impressed with the three lanes, cards, and overall gameplay but then after 50 or so hours you start to see that spells > everything and the first half of the game is pointless.  I'll keep playing, at least for a while, mostly because hitting my head against a wall hoping the outcome will be different is just something I'm found of apparently.


Flawed from the start:
I applaud Valve for realising that their game had major weaknesses upon release and that's why they went from 60k peak users the first two days to 5K daily users by the end of the first month.  The introduced player levels, free packs and tickets for levling, card balancing, etc. but all of this was an afterthought and happened because they realised they messed up.  The damage is done and at a fundamental level they misunderstood the market.  I don't see this game dying as I'm sure they only expected a hardcore niche to stay, but for your average player I see this being a bad investment.




Original Review: Posted: Nov 29 @ 10:41pm

The gameplay is good and I like the three lanes and strategy that goes into each match.  There is a lot of depth here and building decks and testing strategies is definitely fun.  With that said, I don't think this game appeals to the masses and will be very niche, even for TCG's.  Here are some thoughts.

*The only thing I currently don't like is... winning doesn't feel that great, because it doesn't really matter.  When you play free modes winning doesn't do anything.  There is no Win/Loss record, no ranks, no working towards free cards, you just beat a random player on the internet.  When you buy the game you get 5 tickets ($1 per ticket retail) and you can enter Expert Play and work towards free tickets (3 wins) and packs (4 and 5 wins) which adds excitement to the wins but long term, if you run out of tickets, you have to buy more.  I don't see myself constantly buying tickets to get a little more excitement.  I've heard there will be tournaments sponsored by Valve so that really excites me and I'll be waiting to see how the game progresses.

*I like the Marketplace.  You can buy almost all cards for 5-10 cents which helps you round out most of your decks.  Sell duplicates, cards you'll never use, and use the money to buy more cards.  The downside is that although you can do well just using the base $20 game and selling/trading cards, there will be matches you will lose very badly because someone else bought the $10 hero's and spent a few extra bucks here and there.  It's not the end of the world and doesn't happen oftern, but even after two days of the game being release I'm starting to see players understand strategies better and use the epic heros better (Kanna just destroyed me).  95% of cards are under 50 cents, most are under 10 cents, but I'd say there are about 10-15 over 1$ and at least 5 over $10.  But you can always sell items from other steam games (CS:GO, TF2, etc.) and use the cash for cards!  Or spend some money here and there, overall the system is good and it's a big plus instead of rely on buying pack after pack looking for certain cards.
Potentially a really great game. However, in it's current state, it is quite broken due to a small handful of overly powerful cards (Cheat Death, for example, is a big time offender). I recommend waiting until balance issues are hopefully resolved before purchasing.
Writing this review in hopes that with enough publicity Valve will see the problem and improve the game through correcting it.

I don't mind spending money in-game and on cards, I've played TCGs all my life... but when a game gives you literally no other choice in progression than to spend money then something is wrong.  (Especially a $20 game!)

I understand that in a casual draft game you don't keep the cards you draft.. but seriously no rewards for going 5-0? Why even have a W/L if there is LITERALLY no rewards to be earned. What if you went 10-0? 20-0? Nope, not even a single card or pack.

Okay, so you want to play the 'expert' draft and keep the cards.. Not only do you have to pay for the packs you draft with ($10 total) to play, you also have to buy stupid tickets bundled at $5 to enter. There is no reason to double price the GAME MODE that lets you get cards. Even if you enter, you have a win 3 out of 5 games to get your ticket back, and 4 and 5 wins for a $2 pack reward?.. Which would be easier if Artifact wasn't open for the countless people that have been playing the beta for months improving and playing draft the whole time. You are at a disadvantage the whole time, might as well just open the packs you have to pay for and save money.

There is 'expert' constructed that you can play for rewards, but there are the same freaking issues as draft AND your opponent already has the practice and cards to beat you unless you spend $100 in the steam market for a competitive deck. 

"But you can just buy the cards you want on the market!" Why should I have to? I paid for the game, give me a way to earn them.

It's ridiculous, every online TCG has SOME sort of reward system. It's no surprise people are lashing out, I promise you people don't like being forced into paying to progression in a video game.

TLDR
Give people the ability to earn a pack or two through daily/weekly quests or win streaks, it will go a LONG way. Just imagine how much more crazy sucessful this game would but if you could earn things instead of sitting in Mixed reviews.
Probably the best online card game I've ever played and I really wanna reccommend it. However, I can't. Please stay far away from it right now due to the shitty servers and no actual way to get cards other than paying for them.
I don't know if people are being ironic if they're defending this game or not but heres the big deal right now. The reason I won't recommend this game is due to the purchasing of cards. And before anyone jumps down my throat about how you could just buy it all on the market, why should I? The only reason a game such as Magic: The Gathering can get away with it is because it's physical. Artifact on the other hand is not. When it comes to this digital world these cards can be infinitly generated for everyone theres no need to spend it on ink, plastic, packaging etc... so why not let everyone in on making decks?

The thing is, Valve could have easily made these cards for cosmetic purposes and had some of them with different art, shiny, animated etc. But instead everything  is thrown behind random packs or overpriced community market. The godamn Axe is almost as much as the base game. If valve was going to take this Hearthstone route why charge for a base game at all then? While Hearthstone is guilty of RNG packs, the game is completely free. I'm not saying Hearthstone or MtG are flawless or anything, but I'm not going to ignore these big glaring flaws and terrible direction Valve has decided to take.
Fun concepts, matches take to long, and a very steep learning curve, and a very predominate pay2play model you arent going anywhere without dropping money on the game on top of buying in the first place. Game should be free like every other card game
The actual gameplay is fun and refreshing but i cant make a deck or draft because it crashes every time i try and axe costs more than the actual game on the open market which is hilarious/depressing do noy buy
Great game with a huge amount of potential, both casually and professionally.
Unfortunately the economy is rediculous, there's no way to play any competitive mode for free or grind any tickets/cards.
If they make a more traditional economy, I'll come back.
Artifact has loads of potential. As many others have stated, its fresh and really fun to play. Problem is like with the rest of the world, it revolves way too heavily around money. Valve has scapegoated a way for brainlets on Dota to spend their NEET bucks, but people with moral know better. They should have a loyalty system to provide micro rewards at least. That way heavy investors can still reap greater benefits, but people simply wanting to have some fun can slowly progress.

I am also not a fan of black decks atm. They have an unlimited source to nuke everything in sight at no cost. If you pair it with blue cards you can say goodbye to your towers with the same amount of ease (needs some minor balance fixing).

If this game was free I wouldnt care about the pay2win system just so people can enjoy the awesome gameplay. But for now, it gets a red thumbs down as I continue to play it. xd
not worth 20$

P2w is very very noticable cards are just op 

also you have to not only gamble for a good card but win  rank games in a row to even attempt to get a card and btw it cost like  $$$ to play rank for cards.

or just pay  20$ for that op card and win
I actually really like the reward and economy of this game..
But sadly the game itself just isn't very fun.

1. Games just take too long.. each turn gives players way too much time to make a choice.
2. I feel like the game is too abstract.. I'm sure the stradegy is there but it isn't as visible as games like MTG.
3. It's kind of boring.
Eat my fucking balls steam. The artwork sucks. The market sucks. The refund policy sucks. I sold all my cards for $20. Go fuck yourselves and fuck this game.
Unlimited Casual Phantom Draft

Edit: Changed to not recommended. There is just somthing missing, gets boring very quick. Maybe this is because of the lack of progression and no incentive to win (other than wanting to win)  unless you pay money e.g. tickets.  Not worth it, had potential but I think its competely hopeless, since i highly doubt they will be refunding all the money people have already spent to put in a new "monetisation" system. To bad, had been looking forward to this game.
If they teamed up with magic I dont understand some of the mechanics. Just do what ever it is one side needs to do then let the other side do their turns. put instants and interupts in the game, let me place my monsters where I want them to be. Don't place my monsters/heroes for me where they will instantly die. Let me decide if I want to Attack a certain creature or block. sometimes sacrifices need to be made damage wise, maybe taking damage on the tower is one thing but losing a creature right after bringing it out is totally different. This games trash I wish I could have a refund.
A good and enjoyable TGC and strategy game but I cannot recommend this because its monetization system, there is no other way to obtain cards than spending money. When Valve fix this, I could give a positive.
There is no reason to grind, you either pay to upgrade or free play to no end... I can't earn anything by playing even hearthstone while costly to be competative you can at least work towards something. MTG arena same thing you can either be competative and spend some cash or... I spent 20 dollars played twice...and now don't have a reason to continue unless I want to drop more cash...(I spend 100 dollars for each hearthstone exp so I'm not a free to play player I spend money to help me earn win based rewards faster)
The game is too cheap. I can buy a full set for under $200 dollars. Coming from hearthstone this is unnacceptable I should be paying atleast $800 for a full set.
So dissapointed in the final product! If you like to solo play theres absolutely nothing to do. Where are the daily challenges or campaign or anything? i Lucked out and got to attend TI8 so for those that didn't go you are going to pay for the game and then going to immediately have to spend more money in order to build a decent deck....

The actual mechanics and matches are quite fun but what is the point of playing for no reason.

If you were to compare Artifact to Hearthstone, Hearthstone would beat artifact in just about every category except for the actual card game itself. To use a metaphor, artifact is like a young and single dude thats super ripped and attractive but sadly still lives at his parents place and believes in flat earth. Hearthstone on the otherhand would be a portly married man with children but is probably a surgeon cause he lives in a mansion and owns yacht.
Artifact is a card game that will apeal to a very hardcore and competative audience, ones that love depth of gameplay and strategy, it allows for a great range of gameplay and skill in the players, so if you are a player who enjoys games like gwent then you will enjoy the gameplay artifact has to offer. But the game suffers in many other aspects, do not assume you will only be paying the $20 buy in price and never need to pay again, this game has no earnable cards or packs that dont have a purchase tied to them, this is not a game you can play without spending more money, while the cards on the market are cheep, some of the best ones ( as of the time of writing this review) will cost you upwards of $15 on the market for the single card, and if you wanted to get the cards in a pack, you will have to buy those for $2 each. A game with a $20 buy in that is even more punishing to players who want to be competative requireing so much more money purchasing afterwards is a hard sell in my book. another thing this game is lacking is a progression system, their is no ladder or level system so you often dont feel like you are moving forward in your time playing the game. One plus for artifact is that is has a 100% free draft mode, allowing you to draft and play for no fee at all, unlike games like hearthstone or magic the gathering arena which require a buy in price to run the arenas. With my time with the game i find it a hard sell to most people, if you are someone who enjoys hardcore deep card games, then this might be for you, but to an average card game player, as of now i dont recommend it.
This game is clearly pay to win ! In additionm, it's so random and unbalanced. You can even compare this game to HeartStone ! Plz pleae hire best people to build game not worse one. ! Noobs can win pro and no way to outplay random vreep spawn ! why I can't select where creeps can go ? or heroes ? wtf :)
A marginally better monetization scheme than other "free" to grind card games, but that's still not enough to save this game from it's uninspired gameplay and it's ridiculously expensive overhead costs.

Maybe if Valve actually communicated about their plans for this title I wouldn't have been so quick to delete the game from my computer.
Did you ever want to play a moba alone without bad teamates? Well don't worry, now you can, and when you lose, just blame your opponent, or the game, don't worry about having a lot of choice in that regard.

This game is very stressful for a card game, and can get expensive or grindy fast, especially when new sets come out later. The game has a card market, but at some points it feels that Artifact is not a video game that utilizes a market, but it's the steam market in form of a card game. The core philosophy of Valve was focused on the Steam Market, and they designed the game to work like a Trading Card Game inspired by Garfield's MTG with its very outdated business model and game modes. They did change that dumb philosophy after the game crashed and burned, but they now have to change the entirety of the game and its modes to make the game feel like a video game and not like an outdated scam.

The gameplay is good, but the more you play the more you realize how bad the core system of it is. Games last for 20-30 minutes each. This is insanely long for a card game. Card games have lots of RNG, but when each game lasts so long and the RNG makes you lose the game it's much more frustrating than when you play a 5 minute game and then lose to a bad hand. What makes it worse is that there's no mulligan in this game.

Artifact has a lot of quality on the other hand, each card has a nice art and voice lines that tells a big underlying story, which makes the game feel very good, but the gameplay and the monetization model hurt the game a lot. Yes, they might address all of these issues, but it feels Artifact is gonna stay a whale game for the card game hardcores who have a lot of time and money to spend. And with no community and a low playerbase, and no content creators, if you're a casual, getting into this game is gonna be very hard. 

If you want to try it, at least wait until it gets f2p. Many are predicting the game will become f2p by the end of 2019, or when the mobile game gets released.
Game literally has like 10 cards you see in every game and 100 cards no one wants to use because they are just straight up bad. Core mechanics are good, but the game just isn't balanced atm.
After a lot of troubles with running it on linux and finally finishing tutorial i've clicked "accept no refund policy". That's when the game just decided to stop working at all. That really tells you what the game is for.
It's fun, but not fun enough to warrant a 20$ price tag and micro transactions that truley are p2w. Give it a pass. I'd refund but I went afk too damn long.
Cant really recommend it right now. You cant get any cards for free and playing for no reward is boring. You can buy 5 tickets for 5$ and might end up winning nothing and even if you win some packs you might get worthless cards that cost few cents in market. So its risk for low rewards. If Valve dont give some way to get free tickets/packs game gonna die most likely.
A game takes about half an hour, which is way too long as a card game.
The three lanes construction is boring, repetitive and redundant.
It is basically hearthstone x3 identical lanes, but without any of the fun quests or campaign mode hearthstone has.
Man, I really want this game to do well and grow. It's really fun to play. It is missing things and for me it's unplayable. I am colorblind, so when drafting the Red and Green cards I can't tell what is what. When playing cards you have to match the colors, but without a color symbol or colorblind mode, I cant plan out a turn without finding out my hero is the wrong color and I make a game ending error. 

I also feel like this game is missing one of the most crucial things about CCGs, and that is a reward system. There is no gameplay loop to play unless you're playing in the "expert"  mode. What is the point of playing in the events if you get no rewards. Even if i got commons it would give me a reason to play. 

The lack of colorblind mode makes Artifact unplayable to me. The lack of rewards for just playing makes it unfun and pointless. I hope in the near future these 2 issues are resolved, but for now, I'm going to try to get a refund.
You'll barely have any cards because there is no progression unless you pay a lot of additional money. There aren't many combos to experiement with because the game is still young and feels rushed. The three lane system is overly complicated and will make your small deck feel even smaller.

In conclusion. It's a shameless money grab.

If this game was free (which it was for me) I still would rather play MTGarena online.
The game itself is good, it sometimes feels a little imbalanced, but no game as ever been perfectly well balanced, and this one just released.  But the game design is amazing, and since it is made by a reputable company, I'm certain it will only get better as time goes on and more updates and balance passes are released.

HOWEVER...
As many people have already mentioned, the economy in this game is absolutely atrocious, for the following reasons:

- You don't get any free cards by playing. You have to buy, buy, buy.
- You can win packs in the "expert" game modes, but in order to play those game modes, you have to buy tickets ($5 USD a pop)
- The game obviously matches you with openents against which you have a 50% chance of winning. And a 50% win rate isn't enough to win packs, as you need to win a 4 out of 6 for a single pack. 
- You also have to win a 3 out of 5 to win a ticket (and go even). If you don't, you lost $5 and that's that.

In other words, the game is absoluetely rigged to make you lose as much money as possible so that Gaben can grow more fat.
Oh, and if you don't want to play "expert" modes, and just buy yourself a deck to play casual games, here's a few more things to consider:

- Every time you buy or sell cards, Valve is taking a cut on the transaction.
- Card prices can fluctuate wildly, due to market speculations.
- You can't sell a card worth more than $5 if you don't have an authenticator on your phone (yes, the meme is real). Once you install the auth, you still can't do it before a 1 week cooldown. Not game breaking, but still VERY annoying if you needed to "trade" high value cards for your deck.

So all in all, I cannot recomend this game right now.
IF Valve was to stop being so greedy and give us a way to win cards by playing, like almost every other card games in existance is doing right now, AND if they were to lower their ridiculous pricing on tickets, then I would definitely recommend because it's honestly a fun game to play.
This seems like a really well put together game, but becomes less promising if you actually paid for it, because past the initial cards you get starting up there's no way to get cards other than by paying MORE money than the up-front cost. This kind of monetisation is fucked up, and I'm reticent to play more, or even recommend something that is mechanically quite good, with that kind of insidious monetisation blocking you from having a competitively viable deck.
bad mechanics game, no targets to reach (no lvl or rank), cant obtain cards by game way - only to buy. wp volvo one more billion farmed....but still not good game with proud community.
this game is UNPLAYABLE

FORCE SURRENDER ? SERIOUSLY ??

this is not another stupid "pay to pay" review

Let me explain. I m playing competitive turn-based games for 20+ years now. Turn timer was always very important part of a game, when it comes to playing with other ppl, but its purpose was always to finish a turn for u, not to give u DEFEAT if u didnt press the button in time... but this "few years to create masterpiece" does it.

here is how it works - every turn has a time limit but regardless of that if game decides that u r beeing slow without any warning u get this message 60 seconds untill force surrender and this timer is goin anytime its ur turn and reset at the end of round, evey time opponent plays a card or gives turn to u it continues, and this girl is yelling at u that u have xx seconds untill FORCE SURRENDER... not fun at all to play a game of thinking when someone is yelling at u, and if this will happen on lane 1, which has realy good chance if ur opponent just planted new heroes and u need to rethink ur strategy, especialy if u have cards that can be played on other lanes, so if this happens on lane 1 u will have like 5 seconds to lane 3 and make u to skip instantly or face FORCE SURRENDER...

now my experience
i spent 2 hrs learning how to play (tutorial)
confirmed that i will not be able to "moneyback"
then 1 hr to build a deck 
then i pressed a button i liked most (game will find me opponent of equal skill)
then i met genious invention of force surrender (it didnt get me coz i startd to make fast but mostly stupid moves)
then my opponent seemed to dc (too bad that in 2018 devs cant add option to ask player if he wants to wait for his opponent when he gets disconnected)
so i won my 1st game ...kinda... but lost desire to play and went to sleep
then i woke up... but i didnt have that feeling... u know when u got new exiting game yesturday and all u want is go back to play it...
but i decided to try again as i am fresh now
so i tried draft this time
1 hr to make a deck
very interesting game was going
and on round 7 i got killed by ....FORCE SURRENDER
not goin to play it untill they remove this crap

not recommend to ppl who like to think
I feel like its too much luck based. Lots of game losing/winning things get decided by 25% to 50% chances.

This combined with the fact that you need to win 4 games in order to gain new card packs without losing twice makes it feel like a cash grab.

It does have great potential though.
i want to give a positive review, but i cant. how greedy can u be valve? the game mechanics are good, i like the long round and complexity, but u have to pay to get ANY NEW CARD. thats just insane
The gameplay is really good, I've never been the biggest fan of card games but I was engrossed when playing Artifact. However, if you don't want to spend more than the $20 to get in then the game is not for you. While there is a free to play part of the game after you buy it there is no way to gain more cards without paying more money after the fact. The market prices are "fair" and seem resonable for someone who is fine with spending a couple of bucks for a new deck, like how you would if you played Magick the Gathering. I'm just glad I was able to get a refund as I didn't want to spend another 10 dollars to get the deck with the heroes and cards I wanted.
Feel the same way as a lot of the negative reviews, fun game but stupid money grubbing system. No way to earn cards outside of spending money, whose bright idea was that for a game you have to PAY for?
King random is in the house in this pay to win Moba (card) game and their are no rankings.
Could not realy check the ranking as you are somehow banned from cheking it ingame  the no refund  policy. 

Random gritters are spawing everywere wel to tbh those prob are not going to lose you the game but you heros getting killed the first turn prob speeds things up fast.

You can't cast anything when their down that would not be a pain in the ass if the opp can one shot your hero's pretty fast and you got 5 spread in 3 lanes if their not dead wel they can die fast so you prob dont have 5 in 3 lanes wich means you cant use your cards.

Cant use your cards you say but its a card game, wel it is not realy a card game it is actualy a moba game were you get some random spells each turn wich your heros can use thats all.

Oh there is also an ingame shop so you van buy some extra stats

cant realy say this is a review but then again cant say this is a card game aswel
pay to play...then pay to win...Holy Moly this is what it has come too these days?  I dont know if its just because this is the start of the game or what but every time you enter a game you are up against Drow (15.00 card) Axe (20.00 card) or some other wildly expensive card that regular folks that are not going to spend an additional 100.00 to get the best cards.  I imagine it is really boring to play mirror matches with the same crap over and over but how would I know...I only bought the 19.99 game so I cant compete.
Dear Gaben. We really need MMR system, ticket or\and pack grind challenge\daily join reward system like 3 days join or 5 games per day 3 days in a row = 1 pack or something like that. We need quests and also we need promotion system\leveling. Also we need reskin of Lux and Nox to CatGirls \(^W^)/
I'll forgive you everything and change my feedback review if you add cat-girls as Lux&Nox skin!!!
A pay to win game ! Thanks Valve for nothing again get rich or die trying? FFS!!!
Just a little mistake made by Valve! I buyed this game unpacked cards, sell them and then refund the game. Then i buyed the game again and i’ve got again 10 packs of cards and 5 tickets :) i think is not a bug that you can abuse it, but give it a try guys :) maybe you get lucky! The game is not worth 17€ it is a pay to win, this is  a CREDIT card game!
the best bad card game ever played.  nice design but boring as fuck. different modes are pointless, no rewards for winning, no fun after 10 hours.  best card in game: credit card.

Edit after 37  hours in game and after bought some rare cards for meta: 

Costructed is fucked: only 2 decks and the most op is the red black siege that reminds me of the face hunter from HS. gg, so boring to play against. 

Phantom draft is like arena in HS: pray rng gaben or face 3 drow rangers in your face. gg
Sorry, but this game is just not worth it at this moment in time. The tutorial is poorly done, and basically prepare to open wallet. Needs a lot of improvement
Ok guys im going to give you my honest review of artifact after only 10 hours of play

I'd just like to say beforehand that im a magic: the gathering veteran (played since 1995)  and (i don't intend to sound self-serving) have won state titles (australia) so i know what im talking about

Its ok

Not great - just so so

I didn't know anything about the game until only a few days ago - bought it (richard garfield) -  and played a little. My initial impressions were that it was fun (sort of) but they did little to show you how to actually play the game: this was frustrating.  The games were also long. Loooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggg. Long in a way that made draft very difficult to play given the amount of concentration is required over such a long period of time. I also noticed that they have adopted the 'lane' approach, one that they have obviously borrowed from other online card games. I also noticed that there are very few ways to acquire cards outside of buying them. While im no expert at draft, im no slouch either, but im certainly not going to put in all those hours just for a chance at winning cards. At the end of my 10 or so hours of gameplay and after looking at some of the Valve promo  videos ive become a little suspicious of it all. Let me explain that: I really don't think Richard Garfield has designed this game, or has even had a major input. Valve has explicitely stated that they were influenced by Dota mechanics. What i think has happended here is that Valve has decided to enter the online collectible cardgame market, designed a card game derived from both Dota and Magic: The gathering and  employed Garfield as primarliy a marketing strategy. I honestly think that Garfield has had some input in Artifacts' design process, but as to how much is anyone's guess. 

I would have liked to have seen some original ideas here, but they are few and far between - the same fantasy tropes, the same use of mana and colours and the same combat mechanics. If you've played Magic then Artifact is like three games of Magic played side-by-side with some interactions between those games - it is a true test of concentration indeed but i'm not sure that it has taken the genre to an altogether good place. One of the main  reasons behind Magic's success was that the games were playable within a certain window of time. 

I would stay away from this game unless you are an avid fan of collectible card games and have a lot of money to spare. I myself will probably play a little here and there but will not spend any more money on it apart from my initial investment of around 40$. You have been warned.
Pros:

-Great Game Design
-Tons of Potential
-Quick and Intuitive gameplay


Cons

-Money sink
-Forced 50% win rate sucks arsse
-Need to invest huge time and money to even make a progress
-No progression system
-Not Closed Drafts so you get matched up with literally 3 axe decks or drow sniper decks.
-Huge RNG factor in cheating death, homefield advantage, literally just everything.

I'm done. Rant over.
[h1]WARNING: AS SOON AS YOU OPEN YOUR FREE PACKS AFTER THE TUTORIALS, YOU CANNOT GET A REFUND[/h1]

Short and simple,

Positive: The game is good. It's very fun, and a complete new take on card games.

Neutral: For me, the having to buy card packs/cards to get more is neutral. I kinda like it, It brings me back to the physical card game days that have not fully died out but are dieing.

Negative: They don't clearly state that you cannot get a refund if you open a pack. (It's in Gray, Italicized, small text, under the heading System Requirements) So, TECHNICALLY, you could fight them and get a refund since their website says that it needs to be clearly stated. But, if they say no, then it's either you deal with it or take them to court. (USA)

Overall: 7/10. Very fun game, cool mechanics, shade-y business behind the scenes.
This game's biggest problem isn't the fact that it costs $20, it's the lack of cards. I got bored of draft after about a week, every draft started to look VERY similar from the last due to the lack of viable cards. Valve is actively balancing the game but that's not enough, for fucks sake there are only like 13 creature cards TOTAL for red, only like 4 of which are viable in draft.

This game has a lot of potential, however this lack of card variety and a bunch of other unnecessary RNG bullshit make this game an absolute failure.
I was curious about this game, and wanted to try it out, but I don't think I'll pick it up again until Valve changes progression.
In short: the time you put into this game does NOT matter. No matter how much you play, you will not get more cards unless you spend money. A pack of ten cards is $2. To play modes which have a CHANCE to get packs, you pay $1 then you have to win 4 games before you lose 2. A tall ask, since at any point, randomness in the game can just force you into a loss. The amount of time and energy you have to invest on top of the money is just too much. Stick to free to play games which at least reward you for playing. Artifact gives you no reason to continue to commit time to it. It just asks you to pay for the privilege.
There is no sense of progression and every game you play feels pointless, no win/loss no ranked or anything. also the game is expensive if you want to open packets as there is no way to open them other than spending money. such a shame as i was looking forward to this.
I can not recommend this game at all, you have to claim your cards to play ANY gamemode other than training against a bot.

By claiming your cards/packs you automaticly get rid of your refund option, you basicly have to forfeit your refund to see how the game really is.. GG Valve.

Edit: After playing the 2 tutorial matches and 1 casual phantom draft match i must say.. this is beyond ridiculous, there is no way to win without buying a stronger hero or having RNG jesus on your side with the 10 booster packs you receive at the start.

Got trash cards in your starterpack? Tough luck, better buy more packs or don't win at all!
Normal games have "Well Played" emote, this one has "WELL PAID".

After 21st December updae it is still Pay2Play/Pay2Win and will remain as is.

Just to give you a glimpse how much money you will need to enjoy it:
For me getting the whole collection, with duplicates (as required for almost every viable deck) - 350 euros. Think about expansion packs, andy probably it will skyrocket to 1000 euros / year.
Nothing to gain by just playing?gg...
You have to pay in order to win anything?gg..
Rng fucks you over at the beginning of the match=concede(coz no incentive to continue)gg..
No ranked?gg...
Open packs after you have to pay to win something?gg..
While this game was something else...so many features are missing. Cash grab till now no reason to play and progress unless you spend money...stay away
The game locks you out of buying/selling cards for 2 weeks (15 days) if you don't have the mobile authenticator installed, and you won't be able to sell/buy cards of you don't have a android/iphone. And you won't get a refund if you completed the tutorial. Be careful and spend your money somewhere else
games take to long, tutorial is lacking, no content for solo play nor story mode, unrewarding play, store rng is way to big, pay2 play, wales will always have better cards and players who dont want to dump more coin in the game can never catch up, what a shame valve .... just a quick steam wallet cash grab
very unbalanced and extremely uncomfortable game play, maybe just a free game like?
i got board wiped with 2 chain frosts, how could it not be unbalanced. there is no way you can deal with it, or you just 100 creeps
I thought Artifact would be a game I would love. I have played and enjoyed a good number of TCGs and generally consider myself a fan of Richard Garfield's other games. 

What I found was very long games that completely failed to engage my interest. After an hour of play I have no desire to revisit Artifact.
I tried this game for 11 minutes, all in tutorial mode trying to learn this game. During those 11 minutes, I've never, ever seen so poorly designed user-interface, for beginner like me:
- 3 lanes? I'm speechless. You can do this, can't do that, can buy a mercedes during rounds to buff your brain
- Way too many components in the UI, my head can't get around them at all, nor I cant understand it
- I couldn't figure out what's the real endgame, in Hearthstone it's simple to choose deck and go to fight. In here I'm just staring at the screen not understanding anything there is, except cards, which I can't figure out how to play
- I've played Hearthstone for 2 years, probably gonna go back there where you can actually play, and not just ponder how-to-play and what-is-all-of-this. Artifact is clearly not made for newbies, only esports professionals
- Can I refund this crap? Pretty plz?
Edit: Valve pandered to people complaining about price and "earning cards" and effectively did the same thing they did to the DOTA2 market. 

The market wasn't the reason to play the game, but forcing creativity around what you have was a major part of MTG in the 90's. Sure, now everyone can play but since it's just netdecks and pre-created, what's the point. Creativity lost. The mechanics are still interesting and unique - but I'm ashamed at Valve for bending over for people who were never going to play. I'm all for progression but the artificial progression added in isn't the answer. I think earning packs should be rewarded based on creativity. Pack progression is currently limited to the premades. Levels are built around ???. 

It's become too corridored. Creativity is dead. Happened to MTG but should have happened so quickly here.

Original Review
-----

Artifact is a refreshingly good card game with a paywall for entry and horrible DotA 2 aesthetics (why are there cat monkeys flying around my cards?).

With the simplification of mechanics in MTG and Hearthstone - Artificat gives galaxy brain-tier tacticians actual gameplay. Deep, dynamic games and freedom to build as dumb of a deck as you'd like without arbitrary restrictions.

I understand the complaints for the pricing but I don't know if it's actually "predatory".

The part of me that loves/hates Richard Garfield for creating the most predatory gaming platform (TCG) will say this:
You can't play paper MTG without buying the cards. You can't draft paper MTG without buying the cards. Right now, a Magic 2019: Core 10 pack Booster Bundle is $35.19 on Amazon.

$19.99 gives you entry to Artifact and 10 booster packs. You're able to then play the game and a variety of phantom modes. You're able to construct decks without restrictions. You can buy cards you need versus buying more packs to DUST them. You can trade duplicate cards for event tickets or sell them for other cards.

This game feels like a card game and not a "card game-like" experience (ala HS). 
The fear is the meta but most people don't play Yu-gi-oh or MTG competitively. Here's a rant.

I don't see any dishonesty in how this system works or how Valve has framed it. 

It makes sense from a technology standpoint for this to be completely digital. A game this complicated would be a major headache to keep up with on paper. The mindset that all digital games should have a F2P method to 'earning' more gameplay is a problem of the space in general. For years we complained F2P was predatory and cancer killing gaming. 

"REEE Pay to win" and all that. It's fine on "paper" though. I played Magic from 1994 to 2015. I probably spent thousands overall on cards. The older I got the more competitive I wanted to become so decks became more and more expensive and less and less creative. The price guaging got more and more expensive as it became a speculative market. Rares went from a few dollars to tens and twenty dollars. Limited releases became a barrier to entry. Multiple formats were made to appease the gamers and speculators and traders. Rules were dumbed down to bring more people in as the game began to lose players.

This game has been out less than two days at the time of writing this. Card prices on marketplace vary from .01 to a few dollars. Meta is evolving. Game will evolve. If they add card p2p trading any hestitation I currently have on predatory practices will be relieved. That will complete the IRL Trading Card game experience. 

I have no problem paying for this game. My deck is shit, I haven't read any meta guides, I'm playing blind. It's a cool feeling that I haven't felt since playing magic as a kid and making 200 card decks. Valve will likely provide a "FREE" version in the future which doesn't give the entry packs and just lets you play phantom or pre-constructed. I wonder if that will appease people. Not everything has to be competitive. Some people just like games to play games.

Big rant, I'll probably clean this up later after I play more. 7 hours isn't enough to talk on anything outside of initial impressions.
The game itself is really good, the gameplay is enjoyable and and different from any other card game. It does highly reward strategy (as opposed to luck) and games are often very close until the end. If you don't want to buy cards the current gauntlet event is pretty fun with 6 sinergetic decks, each with its own different playstyle and combos. You can also play Casual Phantom Draft if you enjoy building a new deck every few matches without owning the cards.

While the gameplay is very good I wouldn't call this a finished game, a ton of features that Valve promised are still missing like: some sort of progression, spectating, the ability to trade cards, draft with friends, chat, replays, a profile with stats.

Monetization isn't that bad if you look at the price of most cards (which will decrease over time), but it isn't good either. I'm still not sure how Constructed would feel with suboptimal decks.

Overall it's a very good game that still requires many patches before being complete.

Edit: Volvo did an update changing their whole stance. They decided to balance cards from now on, they added some levelling progression where you can earn up to 15 free packs and tickets per season, they also added a seasonal skill rating (0-75), and pay2play is no longer called "Expert Mode" but "Prize Play", making "Standard" the official gamemode to play.

Edit2: RIP Ded Gaem
This is ridiculous. Valve lost my respect. Artifact is totally a "Pay To Win" (P2W) game. 
You already have to buy the game, which is OK, but then you also have to buy the cards inside the game!
What on Earth were you thinking Valve?
It has nothing to do with Dota 2, nothing! 'cause Dota 2 at least respect its players - something that Artifact does not.
It is a pay to win game. The card rarity is more important than tactics and you cant have a good deck withouth paying more than games actual price. Please do your self a favor and dont buy it. Similar games has daily bounty system and even though you dont pay anything you have a chance to compete but this thing doenst have it. It had been borned from pure greed and aim of it to get your money. 

If you have shit loads of money to burn it is your game because like i wrote at the first sentence it is pay to win.
Hello everyone, all in all I dislike this game and not for the economy.  

There are two main reasons to dislike the game - game length and randomness in mechanics and cards. 

Games go way too long, and there doesn't seem to be too many meaningful decisions that you make in the meantime. as a matter of fact the first couple of turns you do pretty much nothing. and another problem that adds to that is that there are no rewards for playing whatsoever. not even cosmetics or anything like that.

the randomness while a part of every ccg by default because of the whole drawing cards from a randomized deck. but here the mechanics and cards are also fairly random for some reason - positioning and attack lines are random. cards too, take for example cheating death - 50% a creature that will die won't. so basically a lot of the times you will win or lose depending on some random effect or a 50%/50% one.

the game also feels fairly clunky and basic without a lot of cards, and the cards that are in are mostly boring. add to this the super long games and you are left with a very long boring match that will be mostly be decided by luck.

overall i am very disappointed and cannot believe valve released this game, they need to take a page out of blizzards book where if a game is not good enough they just scrap it. or at the very least take a page out of gwent that basically redesigned the whole game, it still isn't amazing, but at least they are trying.

pay to play isnt joking but its real 
DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE the microtranscation it this game
its not only card but its all of ur action play draft, pack, card so u cant play freely unless u pay cost
also it has technical issure i crash about 5 time when i play this 

Stay away from this random scammer garbage. Don't even dream of earning some steam money out of prize plays and shit like that cuz it won't happen. You will always draft disgusting piece of shit cards while your opponent will always have imbalanced dumb cards that will fuck you in the ass. + games are too slow and there is no reward for investing your money or your time. 

Just stay away! Don't even think about it.
The game really looks interesting. In a way i want to reccomend it, but in a way not. Is it fun? Yes, but as it is now, they launched the game with a few number of cards in my opinion. There's not a BIG variety of cards, and there's already 3-4 strong meta cards. 

Anyway the game is fun, if you want to support it go ahead. I bought it and don't regret it. I don't care about constructed, as i only want to play DRAFT MODE. 

The one thing i want that will change my review from not recommended to Recommended it will be to have 1v1 Draft with your friends. Is all i want from this game to be perfect. 

In the end, the game looks fun, the graphic style is interesting. I can't really talk about the economy since i don't really care about collecting cards.

The only downsides i see is that you can't trade cards IN-GAME with other players, and there's literally no way to get a free card from time to time or a free tournament. 

I would love to see a FREE DRAFT tournament each week that rewards the winers with 1 ticket or 1 pack. This won't ruin the economy in any way but it will help players to have some new cards from time to time.
NOT recomended for now..

The economy is so stingy .. 

You pay $30 and you MUST pay more for cards.. 

no free quest given .. no game money to be able to use for purchase pack or draft ..
Welcome to the Pay2Pay era!

Like other reviewers already mentioned, everything ingame costs $$$.
Best thing about it, you gotta pay for things that are not even 100% implemented! - e.g. If you wanna play competitive, you have to pay (buy tickets), but there's no ladder, ranking or progession system.

The mechanics itself, three lanes = three matches at once are lame. Creeps only spawns for one lane at a time, so if you're winning two lanes but losing one, you lose
I can't recommend this game.
Gameplay is deep, mechanic is awesome, but no in-game currency, and no other way to get card except buying with real money? Really?
So far I enjoy the game quite a bit, though I find the reliance on RNG a tad bit too heavy for my taste when it comes to stuff like card design (a good bunch of effects with random targets or 50% chance to do X) and creep/hero spawn positions. Other than that the win 2 out of 3 boards concept opens up a welcome amount of comeback potential and allows for infinite mana wombo combos that aren't necessarily broken. 

$20 for as much draft as you want is a great deal imo. However I cannot give this game a good review as long as you have to pay 300 bucks just to get the full game in its launch state. I'm getting tired of the whole spiel of cutting up the game into microtransaction sized bits and calling it "player choice", even though the only choice it gives you is between an incomplete game or an overpriced one.

And no "But other card games are super expensive and p2w, too!" is not a compelling argument because it doesn't make artifact any less expensive or pay to win than it is.
Someone at Valve had a dream to work with Richard Garfield. Someone at Valve had that dream fulfilled and produced an average game with a monetization model that would make EA blush. This game could have been Portal 3, Halflife 3, or L4D3. Instead it's another trendchaser designed to profit off of every single transaction between players. You can't even trade cards in this "Trading" card game without Valve taking a cut of cards you have already paid for. In a world where Magic The Gathering is free to play, you have to be damn good to charge money for everything, and maybe it's a good thing this game just wasn't good enough.
From MTG or Hearthstone? Don't buy this crap and BS game. It's boring, matches are very long, tempo is slow, and it doesn't make sense as a card game. I scaped the tutorial and I was so sad inside.
Random ass shit of a game. Tries to be smart fails miserably. Classic Valve game, trading all possibilities of having fun for a balanced game. Random cards in hands, shitton of cards with random abilities, and random positioning of cards when you click to deploy it. And thats like 80% of the game, positioning. Thats your balance. In being random. 
You want to be smart and play some interesting card combo decks? Fuck you. You gonna play what Valve says dont you even think about being creative. Oh you wanna cast a level 1 most basic card you have? You better have mana for it. You got? Well too bad your card is wrong color. The fuck do you want more? Should i check if the card has wife and kids, maybe they should be fed first before playing? Jesus fucking Christ. 
Oh you made a deck that follows stricter rules then Jews hiding in Berlin in '41? Well great, hop in to the match and watch how 50% of the game unfolds according to random placements of the creeps and cards you get in round 1. Pathetic. Sad. Cringy.
It got me with its boastful "most deep CCG experience" tagline, but I feel jebaited.

It has more complexity than Hearthstone, but that isn't saying much. IMO it doesn't have more depth than MTG. 

Artifact is utilizing the Lane System. I feel like this is a subjective thing, but I think it's inherently inferior to the free form of attack and defence of MTG. If you personally like it, then good for you I guess, but I think it feels stifling.

Currently it also is lacking in game modes. Now most competitors do, but again this is Volvo and with the aforementioned tagline I was disappointed.

Also the Lore is from Dota2, so expect that crowd to get in on the action, for better or worse.

One major upside of this game versus its competition is that you apparently can trade cards on the Steam Marketplace for actual money (albeit only for your Steam Wallet).
Unfortunately I have to agree with most of the feedback.
The game does not offer a viable way to earn cards for free and without spending more money, you will not be able to play in player vs. player which makes the game purely Pay2Win.

It is a shame because the game itself is a lot of fun and has some nice mechanics.

The fact that I have to put even more money on the table after actually paying for the game already, made uninstall it after playing for an evening. 

Unless they remove the Pay2Win I can not recommend the game... sadly.
This game is so annoying. I want to buy specific cards, but it won't let me. I even put $25 on my account and I still can't buy them. There is no way to trade them. So basically all you can do is buy packs. The game is such a grind and overly complicated. 

The endless clicking back and forth between players, an aspect I always hated with Magic the Gathering.  Why even bring up the shop if I can't buy anything??? Now I have click again. Why make me click the button if I can't play anything in the lane???

One of the big turn offs for me is the inability to move your heros to a postion. Then the whole not being able to do anything on a lane when you don't have a hero. Players just get soooo overpowered when you can't play anything in that lane.

The game is basically pay to win like Hearthstone. If you don't have the heros you aren't going to win against other players.
Seeing the name of Richard Garfield, I expected something a little more along the lines of Magic: The Gathering. Unfortunately, that's not what I got. This is a lot more like hearthstone, and seems to be trying to capture that crowd. 

Furthermore, when I requested a refund for this game it was denied because I finished the tutorial and got a set of cards. Not because I purchased anything in the game, just because I finished the tutorial. 

Really this seems almost like a scam to me.
The game is just an unenjoyable mess. RPG up the ass, no progression system, and the endless amount of people abusing draft by abandoning and redoing it until they get overpowered cards is stupid. 
While may of the ideas put forward are great in theory, they prove to be shit in practice. Who on the team played those matches where every single hero you put down gets fucked by RNG, and then had fun passing 20 times next match as the enemy slotted his heroes and put down cards? It's fucking absurd. And by the late game, either one board or even two are abandoned by each player. This means that at all times there's one board where you won't be able to do ANYTHING. At the very least make it so that your turn is passed automatically, there's nothing you can do anyway, for fuck's sake. 
But no, this game is just a lot of flashy production values and a few good ideas, marred down by bad design, from the passivity that's forced upon you as a player at all times, to the RNG that takes place constantly and brings you down. 
I wish I could say I have hope that Valve fixes the game, but I don't. Heroes of the Storm had a similar problem of launching in an unfun state, and no amount of later content and fixes could ever bring back the community. I expect Artifact to be the same. Nobody wants to spend close to an hour in a fucking match to lose to 1 hp difference that comes from a creep put there by the game's RNG. It's just a cancerous approach to game design, and it's laughable to think that this was supposed to be the premiere competitive card game. 50% of the time your job is to unfuck the lane from the bad RNG that you've been given. That is not fun. Cards that change fuck attack direction and buff up your enemies by one point health might change the outcome of the combat phase, but is not conducive to a satisfying experience for the player AT ALL. 

Core game machanics are bad. You feel detached from the game. Let us control our heroes, not just give them stats. Game needs to change to a Living Card game. Valve just love their marketplace, but this would not be a problem if the game was good.
Oh man, i wish i could refund this, no fun to have to spend money in order to play ranked. I mean, i'm okay to pay for the game in order to play it, but this is paying for the game in order to pay for the gameplay. And there is no alternatives, imagine as a dota player that you have to pay a tournament ticket every single time you hit the queue for ranked...This does not reward the time you spent on it, but the money you waste.
15 day edit:
The novelty of the game itself lasted longer than expected, but unlike every other game i play, there is no continuous insentive to play. Once you have a strong deck you are happy with, you just stop carring, why try and increase my decks win rate from 53% to 54%? There are people who enjoy doing that sort of thing, but surely not everyone. 

I reccomend not getting until they add more features.

Origional review:
I am a person who loves mechanics in a game above all else, so when you tell me you can play Hearthstone, or Gwent, or the other hip new card games, but with 50% more mechanics and 3 games at once, im in. The game is also very story oriented, with every card having large blurbs of lore and history for the dota universe. The game has definite potential, and was very interesting to just browse through for the first 10 hours.

Pros:
-very engaging and interesting card gameplay
-high quality UI with very begginer friendly design

Cons:
-Possibly pricing may make people hesitate, but if I know valve, i know there is more to come
I was waiting for this game for so long.
Couldn't be more disappointed absolutely no progression the collection is small and you can't get any card except by paying.
There is a hope they improve it but for now there is just no goal or incentive to play.
I hope valve will  update this game to let us have a way to obtain card with in game currency and increase the reward you get in the event you spend with event ticket,  i love to play  this game . the artstyle and gameplay is great ithink. but i just can't withstand the greed valve have with this game , i hope they can fix this as soon as possible.
So coming from other Digital Card games I thought id Come give Artifact a try.

Gameplay is fantastic and the game is really well put to gether. However the Business model is hurrendous. $20 Buy in gets you...10packs, 2 starter decks and 5 event entries. There is no Ingame progression without Using the most powerful card, The Credit card. 

Don't purchase unless You got the funding to back it up. Go play MTG:A or HS for a less predatory system.
The gameplay is fantastic but i just cannot support this monetization model. It is dated, doesn't translate well to digital and just doesn't feel good to invest more money in a game you've already bought.
I really like this game and find it enjoyable and have been playing it alot and will continue to do so in the near future. However there is still lots of issue in this game that needs fixing. I dont recommend people purchasing this game especially if they cannot afford to pay more money for proper constructed set.


My biggest issues with this game are:

- NO communication from Valve
- Cant grind cards once level > 16
- Still pay to play in Prize Draft/constructed
- item shop RNG is a joke

-----------

Valve please:

- make game f2p
- make game grind-able for cards without paying.
- give us daily quest /weekly quest
- abandon pay2play Prize draft/constructed + ticket system
- give us ladder system and scrap useless skill rating
- Give us more choices in item shop and/or disable its randomness
The complexity of the game makes it very interesting but the fact that it is COMPLETELY pay-to-win destroys the entire concept of it. I really hoped that I would like this more than Hearthstone but now that I played it for a few hours - definitely not.
The game is really good. Sadly there is no progress inside without spending money.
The free casual torneys are stupidly boring, there s nothing to achieve.

I thought the expert mode is atractive, but 1$ per tourney is crazy on long term.
It seems valve is earrning Billions and fooling all the fans.

Its like counterstrike cost 1$/per hour to play.
This game is paced very poorly and due to that fact I requested a refund. When you purchase the game they give you ten card packs and if you open them then you can kiss ever getting a refund goodbye. They need to add a way to get packs from casual play and need to fix the pacing issue. I am upset that I can't just get my money back.
After the game was announced I was looking forward to play it. I forced myself to be hyped while it was in "open" beta and watched videos and streams to learn more about it. After it became available I started playing right away. Now after spending 50+ hrs in game I'm changing my review from Positive to Negative for 2 obvious reasons.

1: Lack of interaction. This might be suprising, but in reality it's not fun. Most of my games go to a point where either I win on lane 1 or 2, or my opponent wins on lane 3 in the same round, or vica versa. Games are usually intense and very close. I like winning by suprising my opponents, like doing 1 turn Ancient kills out of nowhere, or turning around a board with some combat tricks. I really like that last damage back and forth play when each of us equip items, use cheap spells or creeps and holding on to the big guns until the very last moment. I don't like winning or losing by taking interaction away from my opponent. There are tons of cards which aim to do that. You deploy 3 heroes in a lane you are losing to turn things around. You have 10+ mana and plenty of cards to play with. You'll do well, right? Wrong. Primal roar, Sucker punch, Intimidation, Gust, Enough Magic, Nyctasha's Guard, Coupe de Grace, Assassinate, just to name a few cards. I had a tournament game recently where the only thing I had available was passing on one of the lanes for 4 consecutive rounds regardless that I deployed heroes there each round, because of the above cards. The game is not that much fun when all you can do is watch your opponent playing cards.

2: Randomness. I've been liking card games since I was a kid, and I'm well aware of how they work, you draw cards, good or bad, and do stuff with them. What I hate here is the randomness of attacks. 30+ damage can easily curve into a singe creep round after round and while you have a few cards which can change those arrows, it's still very annoying to just observe your tower killing dmg being sunk into a 4 health creep. Another part is the flop. There are games where you instantly lose your heroes in the first round because of bad luck - they went against Phantom Assassin, Bounty Hunter, etc... All you can do is hope that your starting hand of 5 cards will have at least one cheap creep or target changer, otherwise you'll be damned. The games aren't short, so after this start for the next 15-20 minutes you'll be constantly playing from behind, struggling to get to the board and turn the game around. You'll still win a few games if you're playing good and your opponent bad, but most of the times you'll be losing. And after losing a 20 minute long game you lost in the first second of seeing the board, it feels like a waste of time.

It is possible that after a few hundreds of hours into the game you'll really know what you are doing and have a better control over your luck and can manage to pull all the nasty interaction-killer cards yourself and emerge victorious at the end of each battle. But I'm afraid for most people, the road getting there would just not worth it.
Fantastic game... BUT
Can barely play the game after buying the game due to the shitty credit card gate keeping of cards. I don't even want to have the best cards and most competitive deck, I just want something somewhat cohesive that I can work with.

And on top of that you can't even refund the game once you've opened your "free" packs.
its not even a pay 2 win its a pay to play lol 
man there is no progress no reward for playing 
u cant have any new card unless you pay gaben for it 
just refunded ;)
Although this is an amazing game in the time that I've played it (Beta + Full release), it's incredibly fun, matches are fast paced, intense and most importantly, unique. I'm still giving this a negative review because the only way to get new cards is by buying them. As with all trading card games there is obviously a need to purchase cards, that's how a business makes money, but in this case I believe there should be a way to earn cards on your own via random chance or not. Currently it's incredibly expensive to purchase cards and effectively gamble your money away.
There is no way to get more packs for free. You pay 30 bucks and you get a handful of cards (barely enough to make one deck let alone one you want.). Yeah....
The game itself is alright, but the monetization scheme is just straight bad. Hearthstone can be pretty grubby at times, but this is an entirely different level. The content it gives you for the forced entry fee is acceptable I suppose, but it really shouldn't be forced, and you really shouldn't be basically locked at that amount of cards without paying them even more money. I cannot possibly reccomend this game until changes are made.

After looking into the game a bit more, ontop of the monetization, major balance changes are needed. The reason why Axe is 20 dollars, and almost every other hero is literally pennies, is because the balance in this game, is some of the worst I've ever seen, and big, beefy heroes, are 100% more important in every way, than squishier heroes with cool, fun abilities.
I was putting off reviewing this game because I was attempting to get a refund, but as I'm on my 3rd request, and some people have encouraged me to do a review, I will.

I find the game to be slow and unfun. With 3 lanes and a shoping phase, games tend to drag on and on, often with little progress. While the objective is to take 2 lanes (or one lane really really hard), there's always a chance the enemy can pull a lane back, even if you're doing well in it, which means progress within a game goes by leaps rather than a slow back and forth, and because lanes are somewhat limited in helping each other, tower health doesn't feel like a resource to be used (as life in Magic or prize cards in Pokemon) either, and, again, because 2 towers wins the game, winning or losing a lane is less granular than the comparible win mechanics in other card games, as well.

Balancing is poor as well. Not only among certain cards (say hi Axe), but with types of cards. Specifically, improvements and bodies (both creeps and heroes) can be damaged and destroyed outright. However, spells have no counter. The moment a spell is used, it takes effect. If your opponent gets a huge Axe with 3 big items, you can remove his items with Corrosive Mist or Ravenhook, you can outright kill him with Annihilation or Coup de Grace. However, if you cast a spell to condemn Axe or his items...the enemy can do nothing. With no counterplay, spells feel bad.

Finally, much of the game is...passing your turn. Of course, this has strategy, when (and where, due to the lanes) to use your cards, but in one game, I waited over a minute in a single lane for my opponent to keep passing when he didn't even have a hero in the lane, and without a hero, there was literally no play he could make. At the same time, after I had given up on a lane, I once had to sit and watch my opponent use several cards attemping to speed up taking my tower and move heroes, while passing after every....single....action. It's monotonous for both sides. In part, this is the easiest fix (I mean, why force someone to click to pass if they literally can't take an action? Just remove it.) However, it's also very hard to fix in situations where there are possible plays, but a player is commited to not making them, or, perhaps they want their opponent to use a few cards toward a combo and then Annihlate the lane, because in these situations, I see no way to do it other than sit there...clicking clicking clicking, due to how the game is designed.

I'll say nothing about the market system, because I got the game thinking of only playing free drafts, so I had no real intention of playing the market, just the game.

Last, I want to say, I've played the game less than 2 hours and requested a refund on the same day, and been denied. It seems that Valve isn't issuing refunds at all for this game, even though they claim it's no automatic refunds only. I'll happily change this part of my review should I be issued a manual refund, which is not ruled out anywhere, and I fully expect Valve to stand by their publicly stated policies.

Overall, I do not suggest paying for this game in its current state. I wouldn't suggest it even for free, let alone at the $20 entry fee. I also don't expect the problems to be fixed, because the game's design is somewhat based on some of the issues I have (the one card per turn nature of the game means spells will likely never have counters, the 3 lanes and shoping phase is core to the game's design, etc.), but, should these things change at some point in the future (I don't plan to change my review for game changes), it may be worth trying out for free or at a deep discount. Otherwise, spend your $20 on something else.
I tried to refund this game. Little did I know that nice little free pack you get after the tutorial is a trap. Here is an email I got from Steam when I tried to refund this game.
"Hello Doodlederp

This game is fun. Which is unfortunate is it is a blatent cash grab. The only way to get new cards is to buy them with actual money. If you pay money for the game, you should not have to pay money to get to the main part of it. You are given a few cards, but otherwise must buy them with real money. This is a dissapointing direction I hoped Valve would not take for this game.
Engaging, complex, and very polished card game. 

But the Pay2win & pay2play monetization of the initial cost, card packs, game tickets, and indicidual cards is nothing shot of greedy on Valve's part. 

For £16 you can have fun, but if you want to be competative expect to spend a lot more.
It's a good looking game and it seems really deep, but I don't feel like the tutorial does enough of a good job at explaining everything for somebody with no experience of this kind of card game. What do the different phases mean? Initiative? What dictates where the creep spawn? What dictates when heroes are ready for re-deployment? Etc. etc.

I would've wanted to give the game a bit more of a fair shot and properly learn it but due to the monetization model, I have to make up my mind already and I did not enjoy the tutorial at all due to all the confusion. I might give the game another go a bit down the line once it's gone f2p.
Very poor value for the money.

I found the game to be extremely poor value if you only intend on spending the initial game price. You'll likely have to spend an additional substantial amount of money on tickets or the Steam market to build a reasonable deck. Unfortunately, I had some bad luck opening my initial 10 packs and didn't receive any card worth more than a quarter on the market so I have nothing to sell to put towards building a deck.
I don't know what's more confusing, the 50 minutes tutorial, or how will this 30+ minutes per game game is "planned" to be released on mobile.

Monetization is the least of its problems, and if it didn't have a DOTA 2 skin, it would of been DoA.
How Duel and Call made it into release but CHAT didn't is beyond me. Obvious design and balancing flaws aside, it's really annoying that basic functionality like adding people to friend list and you know, talking to them is completely absent.

Mechanically game looked good at a glance, in reality it's just another unsatisfying chance simulator with all of the cool stuff buried under RNG. Instead of being manascrewed you can now enjoy being arrow/deploy screwed. I thought 20+ years of this unsatisfying nonsense was enough, guess not. Super swingy cards as well, things that can win you the game are obtainable on turn 1 or 2 if you are lucky enough (again, RNG).

The worst thing is, it's just boring, I'm about 12 hours in (left it opened for a while, hence the 24h counter) and already I feel like i've seen everything game has to offer (whch is not much).

You can't draft 1x1 against friends either, that would redeem things a bit, but alas. I doubt i'll be coming back to it any time soon, if ever.
I really wanted to like this game, but the absolute clumsy rollout, followed by utterly inadequate adjustments once things started going wrong, makes it pointless. I'm not usually Mr "This game is dead/dying", but unless Valve does something significant soon, there will be too few players for this game to matter at all, and no new players will be interested. As it is, the steamcharts for this game have got to be extremely embarassing.

The only move I can see them making that has any chance at all would be to go F2P, which, as someone who paid for the game, will probably screw me over to some degree, and given their actions so far, will be an absolute greedy P2W shit show. Hard to believe Valve screwed this up so badly.

Play only if you hate money, balance, and more than a handful of other players, otherwise give this one a pass.
If you are fine with just playing draft with 0 rewards, its ok. Game itself is very fun with great mechanics. But if you want to play constructed, or want to play any game mode with any sort of rewards, its pay to do anything.

I don't know why valve decided to take such terrible monetization model and slap it onto otherwise a great game. Nearly every other competitor in virtual card game market is f2p + free ways to earn cards but in artifact, its pay to get in, pay to get additional cards for constructed, and pay to play in any modes with rewards. The only good thing about their monetization compared to other card games is the fact that you can buy and sell individual cards. The game took monetization model that made sense for PHYSICAL card games and applied it to virtual game where it just doesn't fit.

I really hope valve rethinks their monetization strategy since the game itself have potential but as it stands now, it is only for niche group of people who only wants to play draft or are fine with shelling out $$$ for constructed.
Gameplay feels like boring arithmetic homework (this coming from a math & card game nerd)

Poorly documented; even the most basic things like creep placement and the 25/50/25 attack direction arrows are not explained at all. Wiki browser open from the first turn of the first tutorial.

Buggy; for me the program crashes 100% just by clicking on the system options menu, among other glitches

Morally questionable "you can't refund this game because you opened the packs you get after playing the tutorial"
I had hope to get some decent cards from the packs... but i wont support Pay to Win to get cards - there are other games out there which are free to buy and with time you can get your collection without money
There are simply better competitive card games out there, this game lacks balance in terms of decks (especially hero cards) some hero card is just clearly stronger stats wise and skill wise. This game is literally just credit for the win its almost like steam is insanely short on cash and needed fast cash its very disappointing.
With no way to acquire basic cards for free this game is a money pit. Don’t get involved. More expensive than Hearthstone - by far. If you’re going to drop hundreds of dollars on a card game then play Magic the gathering or something.
Great mechanics. Great visuals. You can se that is has lot same level of complexity as magics. But in order to play the game and enjoy it you have to spend lot of money and i mean looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooot. Pay to ply and pay to win.
Pros:
Amazingly fun gameplay
Beautifully animated
Great art style and sound design

Cons: 
Absolutely atrocious monitizaition method. Even not allowing additional packs without money, you cannot even "infinite arena" like in other games if you are good enough. Not to mention that it takes THREE wins without more than ONE loss just to BREAK EVEN in the expert draft mode with NO REWARDS.

Turn Timers feel a bit long currently, at least in the early game.

RNG for minion placement is huge. You can have 2/3 or even 3/3 heroes dying turn 1 due to hero placement, but in turn your opponent will generally get screwed out of their victory by your bullshit minion placement giving you a comeback.
Great game that brings a lot of new features to trading card games. The only issue I have with this game is its very expensive. Im surprised this game actually costed 30 bucks with the payment model its currently using. You cannot obtain cards unless you buy them... some of them being very expensive if they are rare unless you want to gamble with packs. I get this was the norm for most trading card games back in the day, but one of the things I think newer digital card games have done is taken that feature away and allowing people to play to obtain new cards instead of pointing to the corner of the game with gauntlet and asking players who do not want to spend any additional money to play there. thats not how you motivate a playerbase to keep playing and certainly a big turn off for new players in the future, competeing with people who have thrown in 500 dollars. People will look up how much they need to spend to have a decent deck, get sticker shock and drop the game. They are not even trying to ease you into an addiction, its just, heres some packs... you need to buy everything else from here on and pay to play competitively GLHF. Hope they fix this and patch in some cool additional game modes.
Early Review (may change)

Let's put this modestly: the game has potential.
You get to play through 2 bot games for the tutorial, which is enough to get a feel of how the game plays and flows. I must say I liked the smooth animations and aesthetic of the game board at first, though after a while, it just fades into the backgorund as you are focused on the real meat of the game: unit stats/abilities/etc.

From what I heard, the RNG the game throws at you that you can't control, like random Hero/creep placement in a lane, is supposed to be something you learn to mitigate, but it can be quite annoying. You do get a sense that there is more under the surface, for example if your placed hero goes right up against a losing matchup, you counter it by playing towards another lane, and defensively playing your losing lane.

Red Heroes tend to be high health/ and high attack, so that visible hulk of stats on their side can seem overbearing, or if on your side can take down a turret very quickly. And that's one of the qualms I have at the moment. You can swing a lane into taking a turret very quickly, and half of it wasn't even under your control due to two creeps going to that lane or some shit.

The second qualm I have is that you find yourself just doing nothing for a lane, because you can't play any cards. You need a hero of a particular colour to play other cards of the same colour, + mana costs means that a bunch of the time, you just pass. There's no fidelity in that, except when you can play a card that can choose a lane. You can use one lane's mana to play a spell that affects another lane. Now that, I really like, it rewards smart resource usage.

Now any sort of card game will inevitably give you lots of deckbuilding options, by design of cards leaning towards certain archetypes. Maybe you want to play an aggressive statted deck, or a spell based one, or a swarm based deck. The problems lie in how you win the game, you damage the enemy turrets, but the way creeps and heroes play out on the board, I don't feel like I am controlling very much of the outcome with how heroes and generated creeps go to a random location and creep cards can only be played to the very left or right of a board.

Reynad had a point when he said it was the best designed bad game. You get a lot of crafted elements: the cards, heroes, gameplay, collection, deckbuilding, marketplace but put together, doesn't feel quite genuine. Feels like a pretender of some sorts, I can't quite put a finger on it. But there's enough there to keep a lot of people engrossed with the game for a while. Me though? It's up in the air. It's a decent playing experience, though if you are focused on the gameplay flow and mechanics, it seems rather off.

The market is not as bad as it seems. Besides some prominent Rare heroes, the bulk of the cards can be bought for cheap and will probably go down further. I'm personally not concerned about having to get the top priced cards though, for the moment. However, in the future, when they release more sets, the cost could keep going up and up, if they release a rare that becomes a super staple. Right now, most rares are specialised/situational.
Sadly I currently can't recommend buying Artifact.
It's a great game but it's quickly bleeding players and Valve doesn't really seem to care or take any action to change that.
I'm a fan of Dota 2, and when I play Artifact. I want to talk :
Fucking trash game, Pay to Play then Pay to Win.
Waste time, money.
This is Bullshit !
This game should be delete.
Cost of a full collection currently stands at  ~$300. Tier 1 decks $40-60 through the market.  There is no possibility to gain cards without monetary input. Valve takes 15% cut of all market transactions, meaning you lose value very quickly if you're not content to grind with one deck or the meta shifts (which is likely immediately after launch).  All game modes that offer tangible objectives cost $1 per run. 

Free phantom draft for $20 dollars is decent value assuming valve does not remove it, but it's ultimately unrewarding given the lack of any ladder or visible mmr. Tournament mode is impressive and unique to Artifact within the ccg space. However, it relies on the community's willingness to host and organize and likely won't be a huge draw for the average player. This could change in the future if third parties take up that mantle.
Very slow balance patches and no communication from Valve
this is a VERY DEAD game
don't buy this it is a total waste of money
for 20USD you get 10 packs of cards 
right now on the market you get about 4USD in value for 10 packs

I really wanted this game to catch on but even Valve doesn't care about the future of this game then why the hell would I keep playing?
Update: Changing the review to negative to show Valve that we want REAL Valve games. Artifact is decent at best now that I've played it a lot. Valve, please, return to your roots :(

-------------------------------------------------

I want another Half-Life game just as much as anyone else, and it's kinda sad that this is Valves first new game in what, 5 years? I miss the old Valve.

I thought I'd try this out anyways, despite the fact its a card game, and despite the fact that the monitization model has a lot of controversy. I can honestly say, this game is [b]really fun![/b] I don't care about being super competive, so I don't need all the expensive cards to be happy. I'm just playing casual games, working on my decks, learning, and having fun.

Artifact is a deep, very polished card game that is hard to learn and hard to master, lol. But it's fun, and thats what matters.

TLDR: Fuck you Valve for making this. But its good for a card game. The monitization isnt that big of an issue. Still want some real games though. Please.
As someone who has been invested in Artifact since Marchm, who watched every pax stream, listened to almost every podcast, and participated in as many beta key competitions as I could stomach I quit because the game feels lifeless and cold.

Valve put a lot of effort in making sure the mechanics were great but you can tell they didn't bother to give the rest of the game any attention. You can't interact or communicate with your opponent. There are piss-poor social features that make it a chore to play with other people. There is nothing fun to work towards that doesn't involve money. They tried to emulate TCG's but failed to capture what made playing TCG's great (the physical aspect of the cards, the social get-togethers) whilst providing none of what makes online gaming great. It feels like playing a board game online against players you can't communicate with.

I was optimistic about the market but honestly on reflection it is one of the worst aspects of this game. No amount of buying/trading gives the digital cards as much meaning as a physical card. It is like collecting/trading postage stamps vs collecting/trading digital postage stamps. It isn't the marketplace that made trading cards appealing but rather being able to own and trade physical objects of tangible and sentimental value. It seems like Valve assumed that the digital format would also capture that lightning in a bottle but in reality it just rips the soul out of it. The worst part is that they have done nothing to fill the void--the game itself is devoid of any charm. I still have my somewhat valuable collection of Pokemon cards from 20 years ago. I sold my Artifact cards a week in without giving it a second thought.

The features the game does have seem to have not been tested at all. The tournament feature is not streamlined. I've joined a dozen tournaments and almost everyone of them have been a different event type. I once joined a 4 player 2 round swiss--that is, each player only played against two of the four players and that was it. Not a single tournament allowed you to spectate because no one who created the tournament realised you had to enable spectator rights individually so when a tournament was being held up by a long game people just left instead of sticking around because no one wants to sit there in a chat waiting an indeterminate amount of time for two players to finish a marathon game. There is no online browser or community feature. It just feels so lazy, almost as if they expected everyone to be so enthralled by the game that they would go out and make their own communities and organise everything amongst themselves.

This game didn't need a release, it needed an open beta so these flaws could have been exposed in a more healthy way. But more importantly it needs Valve to admit that as a video game and an online experience it just isn't very good (mechanics aside).
As many have previously stated the game itself is fun and the mechanics are interesting, but the fact that to gain any additional cards you have to pay is absurd. Even in Hearthstone you can have dailies to get enough for at least a pack, a system like that would of gone a long way with this model. Unless you are comfortable paying money for more cards there are only a handful of things to do to not pay money and of course they have no rewards.
Wasn't as fun as I expected it to be. I looked up the game on twitch and followed guides. It's very different and maybe over time there will be a more streamlined approach to the game but as of right now it doesn't feel all that fun, and the fact that I can't work to unlocked packs at all feels really unrewarding from a replayability standpoint.
I really wanted to like this game, and its not terrible, but not that great. For sure it has a lot of strategy but there are a lot of turn offs too. You basically have to manage 3 different game boards and have no limit on cards in hand or on the board. This gets pretty hectic at times with 100+ different items. The powerful hero cards are placed randomly initially then on random sides on a lane of your choice. You and the opponent go back and forth playing cards until you are both done. This is sometimes annoying since a lot of the time in early game you and the opponent just spam click end turn since no one can do anything. Card text is kinda small, you have to bring up a card to tell what it does, the tutorial is not comprehensive at all. One thing that really bugs me is that card effects come and go so fast you don't know what even happened. With card history you can see the last card played, but thats it. And it has indicators if a unit is about to be killed, but a lot of time this doesn't account for modifyers and I get killed without any understanding why. This game is fun and I'll play the free drafting mode some more, but there are way better digital card games out there.
My friend gifted me a copy, now I feel bad he payed twice for this game
Awful P2W system....cards cost up to 10 euros? On top of the original price? No thanks...I wish the game was more like Dota, free ranked que and no need to pay for heroes.
I don't ever write reviews but this game pissed me off so much that I think it's worth warning about.

Tutorial (C-): Clear and concise for about 4 minutes. Guidance was abruptly stopped and anything beyond telling you to click a card to figure out what it does is all you get. If you are going to make us waste 40 minutes on a tutorial at least tell me what everything does. 

First Match VS real opponent (D): My first match said it would match me with someone of my same skill. It found someone and loaded up fairly quickly. I figured since I was brand new and only using the basic starting deck it  would match me with someone similiar. That was NOT the case. I matched with someone chinese who had every rare card and hero in the game. I played the match anyways despite my clear disadvantage and actually thought I had a chance of winning at one point. LO AND BEHOLD the clearly overpowered cards dashed all hopes of an even fair game.

Microtransactions (F-): After my defeat I figured I needed a few better cards to even play casually so I went to market and found a few hero cards I wanted to purchase. I left them in my shopping cart and went to the bathroom. Came back to find the one of the hero cards (due to a fluctuating market) had just gone up $3 dollars. $3 dollars in 1 minute! Raising my price. If I have something in my cart I'm pretty sure it's illegal to change the price without warning. Which there was none. I purchased the cards anyways despite better judgment. After going through the payment with receipt and all I never even recieved my cards! No error message or anything. I restarted the game thinking they would show up but when I went back to the market I was greeted with the following message (You have been restricted from the Steam marketplace due to the following reason -New payment method) ARE YOU KIDDING ME VALVE? I just spent money on your ponzi scheme and now I'm banned from the marketplace for using Paypal. Now I have to fight for a refund for this game as well as fight for a refund for what I purchased in game.

Final first impressions (F): This game has a pretty UI with decent graphics and unqiue gameplay but that is where anything positive about this game ends. If you enjoy DOTA you may like this game for it's lore and challenging(figure it out on your own) gameplay. but if you are anyone else I suggest you RUN from this game and the scummy microtransaction P2W game it truly is.
It's a decent TCG with several new amechanics, namely heros and shopping phase. Other than that, there is nothing new. 
Multiple-lanes is there in The Elder Scrolls Legends for a while. 
The color system is basically the same as MTG: UW control, Mono-Red aggro etc. Those keywords in the game are also clichés.

And the economic system of this game is just a joke.
Charging people for 20% of the transaction fee is simply a rip-off . Although each pack has a "gold" card, most of these cards won't worth a penny in the later life cycle of a expansion. And, there is NO in-game currency yet, which means you'll pay real money for basically every pack. All these makes Artifact a miserable $20 pay-to-win game.

I highly recommend you to pay $20 for Thronebreaker instead of this crap.
An amazing card game thats unfortunately being held back by its monitization methods. I don't like to use this term lightly, this game is Pay to Play.
From my first review 2 months ago:
**In it's current state I couldn't recommend it, maybe after some time passes and they start balancing the game, fix the market, and the exclusive beta experience matters less things will change enough to make it worth the buy-in cost.**

After so much time w/o the changes necessary to make the game approchable and enjoyable for most of the people interested in it (50k 2 moths ago), the game has now become an exclusive game for: the people that dropped thousands of hours in it during the closed and embargoed beta and now probably feel like it would be a waste to quit considering the time spent, and the very few people that actually enjoyed it in it's state and will probably stick with it until it's dead for good (3k peak-1.5k lowest now and still going down daily).

Damn shame to see Valve lose so much goodwill for less than 20$ with this.


One month later edit (still checked in on the game every month or so after release in hopes it would change it's course):
With constant unfulfilled promises and things like "Unchanged: Still in it for the long haul" in the inconsequential updates, the game peaks today doesn't even reach the lowest of one month ago with >1000 high and >500 low.
Artifact brings a new twist to card games having to manage 3 boards.  sadley the game is pay2win and theres no way to advance and enjoy the game without pulling out your credit card.  the game needs daily quests for free packs and tickets for this game to have a long lasting relationship with players who don't want to spend money.
Currently simply not really fun.
The game is missing incentive to play, some may like that but usually to most people nowadays, they need more reward than just to know they've won. 
A good part is that they now added a few more social features, so at least it doesn't completely feel like playing with a NPC anymore. 
The incentive also doesn't exist to play the expert modes, which cost around $1 to play and break even at 3 wins and 2 losses, as the cards are currently not worth anything at all.
To some this may be a positive, because you can get yourself an entire collection for extemely cheap, but for me it takes out the incentive to play for packs.

Another big factor that really annoys me is the massive randomness of the game. I didn't realize it at first, however there are so many random elements in the game, that a lot of the time you simply feel cheated. 
Of course every card game has the randomness of which cards you get and this is totally alright, even though you can't draw as fast as in the majority of other card games and rarely actually get all the cards in the deck.
However, there is so much more random elements. Beginning with cards that will attack random enemies, creeps that will deploy to random lanes, several cards that have a coin toss on wether they are usefull or not (There is a tower imrpovement that makes it so that every unit you have on that lane has a 50% chance to not die when receiving killing damage, resulting in some units surviving 4 rounds without dying and another card that does stuff like increases its own attack by 4 with a 50% chance of happening). 
The biggest and most annoying randomness factor of them all however is the arrows. The game has certain attack arrows that come new each round and that you can't see, it can result in your units attacking enemies that will die anyway, even if said unit could potentially end the enemy.

The games are always ridiciously close and all these random factors result in you always feeling that you won or lost mainly, because random chance was on your side. It simply isn't fun to try to play around all that randomness and doesn't feel rewarding to me.
As such in its current state, I can't recommend the game.
Eh, go play "Magic: Arena" where you can at least do dailies to increase your collection slowly.
But hey, at least it's still better than Hearthstone.
Holy Shit this game is complicated.  No thanks.  This makes MtG look like checkers by comparison.

Having played it some more my opinion has only gotten worse, not only is it complicated, it's expensive as fuck.  You basically can't make any deck of consequence w/o paying more $$$ (if you want to play constructed).  Now way to earn cards AT ALL from playing?  Fuck that.
In a word: Convoluted. There are often scenarios where you can't even tell what happened, especially at the start of a lane. There's no good history to look at and the time limits don't give you much time to think at all. This is necessary because if you do hit the time limits a lot the game takes 30-60 minutes to play a single match.
Graphics are good, game runs smooth. That doesn't matter if it's obfuscated and weird.
Disappointment at launch. 

It's a $20 game that isn't as fun or engaging as free-to-play games on Steam, but still expects you to cough up more money for card packs.
It's a shame that pretty neat concept of gameplay got buried under terrible monetization scheme that forces you to pay after even smallest defeat which can happen cause game seems to be based heavily on RNG
Fun game, a unique mix of MOBA and TCG. The only MASSIVE problem is the fact that you need to spend a little bit less than a hundred dollars just to build a strong competetive deck.
Unnecessary redundant process, some slow players even agravate the situation. $20 entry fee is ridiculous. Game is very uncontrolable... everything is bad...
Great game but I can't recommend it with the current monetisation model. True TCG work because you get an actual physical card. This does not translate into an eTCG because by it's very nature you don't actually own anything. The reason a game like Hearthstone is successful is because the F2P model works as a F2P player can work their way towards a P2P players collection, it just simply takes a lot of time.

F2P model in Artifact and hands down it is the best (in my opinion) eTCG.
I don't approve of pay for play or pay to win models. If there was a way to progress through the game any other way without being forced to pay for a random chance at getting a card you may need, I would rate it positively. At this point, I can't.
Randomly freezes during MOST matches or simply won't connect when starting the game.  Probably should still be in early access/beta. Oh...and no rewards for playing, win or lose. A refund would be grand!!!
The balancing is as if a baby fresh out of the womb was told to tightrope walk across the twin towers as the planes were hitting them. This card game has some of the most bullshit I've ever seen. Just play Dota instead.
Fantastic depth in gameplay, the controversy surrounding this game comes from the 'pay2win' model - I disagree with this entirely, The base game provides you with a huge amount of cards - more than the 'play2pay' models like Hearthstone while providing a much better experience overall


**UPDATE** - This game is shit fucking p2w bullshit kill me
At first you might think the game is less RNG than it's competitors. That's simply not true.

After you know how to play the game the outcomes become purely RNG and complete out of your control.

I have 500+ matches of prize drafts played (did not play constructed) with winrate of 58%+. Even with such winrate the matches just feel RNG.

You cannot impact:

- Initial hero and creep positions
- Your drawn hand -> eg. 3 signature cards in the deck -> you don't get a single one through a game
- 25% arrows/curves
- Golden Ticket / Secret Shop isn't mirrored
- Consumables -> games without a single TP
- Creep spawns on the lanes

-> too many things are out of your control, which lead to the "why play when it doesn't matter that I played the game perfectly?"
I would recommend the game, it's a breath of fresh air, but i really do believe it will be way too expensive in the sense that you cant get packs other than from buying them. Hearthstone really have the packs system figured out, they would do well to do something simular. Give away some pack here and there, no need to copy the hearthstone system but casual player wont be able to play even on a semi-competitiv level because of the prices. 

I would love to actually be able to play the game with a decent deck without emptying my wallet, but in the meantime, if you dont have a lot of money to throw into the game, It's probably not for you.
The game looks fun and for the amount it did play it was quite enjoyable however, with how the games non reward please buy system its hard to give a posivtive rating. If you got the cash to spend im sure its a fun game but for those of us that have to watch our spending this is prob not the game for you.
I think this game was a great idea that fell short, and my review has to do with issues of gameplay not monetization.

This game feels like MTG 2.0 with lots of half-punches being thrown. It feels like it could have been one of the true contenders of the CCG/TCG, but it fails mechanically to understand either games nuances it to me.

My strongest opinion is that the powercurve feels like shit in constructed play.

I won't say it's not a fun game (because it was), but that it ran out of fun for me around 90 hours.

I hope in the near future to be able to change this review to back to positive again.
Bought the game. DId the tutorial. And apparently I can't play 3/4th of the game modes because you dont start with any cards. So you pay money for a game you practically cant play? come on Valve, why not just start selling HL3 preorders when you are at it.
Complete dumpsterfire of a game that, despite all the negativity, is actually a very promising ccg. Yet Valve fails to communicate with its ever shrinking playerbase and has been for months. Promises aren't met and problems aren't fixed.

Ignore this title and pretend it never happened.
The tutorial made it seem a lot more interesting than playing it is.

It's boring as heck.  The red flag was when they said "Actually playing the game prevents you from being able to refund the game."

One issue that's noticable in minutes of playing, is it's too easy to get an unstoppable force.  You can set up hero's to be so powerful there's no return for the enemy.  You either have the counter in your hand or you surrender.  It's these easy imabalance combos that existed in MTG!  Oh who worked on this... Richard Garfield.  Well, that explains why easy to see imabalances were missed.

Yeah, they knew.  This is the worst game Valve has ever slapped their name on.  The boo's they got at TI were deserved.
Fun from what I played but I haven't recieved my 10 packs for what amounts to a free to play game where there are no options to purchase cards outside of microtransactions.
Refund denied if you get past tutorial
I wanted to refund the game but my request was denied because apparently I have opened an in-game purchase : the starter pack you automatically get for free after the tutorial.
Or if  you  buy / sell 1 card on market you take this : We cannot grant a refund at this time. This purchase included in-game items that have been consumed, modified or transferred

So watch out, you won't be able to refund if you get your starter pack!
How to make DOTA2 as a TCG game.... you make Artifact. Then you make so many things and options and trow it without a normal tutorial. It is an interesting concept but in the world where you have MTG and Heartstone as BIG names and not to mention few other IPS, Artifact dont have a place. You dont have a feel that you play TCG it feels more like playing Triple Wild Cherry Slot Machine.
refunded as soon as i found out how the shop worked. really goed mechanics but ruined by the monetization scheme behind.
18 euro for a game which you cannot play competitive without adding layers of money for new cards as its an only buy to play model for packs no source of cards what so ever wihtou paying real life money.
The game is so the difficult like I have trouble putting on my undie every morning and they expect me to use my brain. Ima stick to a braindead game like hearthstone.
pay to play concept, perma lags & DCs

and some nice features like: annoying  interface where u cant edit important stuff like  Fontsize or disable imps, many small bugs, failed start (1h later), rly awful trailer for multibillion company,... right now game feels like early beta

dont get it wrong - its may be best card game right now, but greed destroy it
After the last 1.2 update, we can finally grind for packs and tickets, yet still, not infinitely. There is a finite number of packs that can be obtained without paying and the amount of effort needed to acquire said packs is just too much for what you get in return.

Artifact might as well be on its way of becoming the greatest digital card game ever, but I can't recommend it to anyone as long as it is pay-to-win. Fortunately, Valve has taken some steps toward the right direction and hopefully will keep doing so in the futere.
1 game is around 20-30minutes, if we want to grind for packs, it will going at least 2.5 hour to grind for 3 packs of cards if we win every round. 
i don't think its feasible for people who do not want to spend additional money. i will be requesting for a refund before spending anymore.
It's actually P2W now. The community is so small that the only people that still play are the people that bought all the cards. The only way to get extra cards is to either beat the people that have all the cards in the game (impossible) or buy cards.
I like the very different core structure this game has, BUT i have a few points of critique that probably won't change anytime soon.

1. An unnecessary reliance on random effects. The random placement can wreck you in the first turn of the game (just putting your weak squishy heroes in front of their killers). Also the random attack targets (why can't i choose those?? - The hidden choices of placement are fun and interesting, why can't i select at the start of the match where my heroes go? Why can't i move them? Why can't i select their attack targets?? Either your weak heroes are fed to the enemy or your beastly killers are at the edge of the board and don't influence the board state, and often you can do NOTHING about it.
Even when you have two killers standing in front of each other, one might attack while the other one thinks it's better to kill a random worthless creep to the side.

Also, DISGUSTING COIN FLIP CARDS! WHYYYYY do game designers design cards like Cheat Death and Fog of War? Those are NOT good game design. Who thinks those are an enjoyable mechanic???

2. The feel of hero identity is weak. A lot of heroes are just a collection of 3 stats and 3 forced signature cards in your deck. The core of the DOTA feel is the 4 abilities on every character - how long until they hit a brick wall when designing new heroes for this game? (Axe for example - the most valued hero currently - is just an inflated stat pile that's almost impossible to kill, and i find that boring)

3. The future is in doubt due to the economy of this game. I am not as annoyed to pay to play as others are - even though I find card packs horribly overpriced as in most other card games today. But the worst of it is that while you're playing, you're not playing towards anything. No quests, no story, no packs, no progression. I expect that this will kill the game, and pretty soon.

One of the most enjoyable things in a card game is slowly (!) gathering the cards you want and need, iterating over and over on your own idea. Sadly, in this game the incentive is either to dump down the cash to have the deck you want immediately or just drop the game and play something else.
May go back and change this BUT NOT NOW. The game is good but VALVE SUCKS
So When I firstly pass the tutorial, I saw the price of Axe as $26. And then THERE IS NO STARTING PACKS NOR UNOPENED PACK NOR TICKETS NOR ANYTHING!!!! I mean seriously???? Valve hello???? 
And then after half an hour while the price of Axe already fell to $10 I finally get my packs and I opened them. I start a draft just for fun. When I drawing all 60 cards and finally put 49 of them into my deck and I click register.

AND IT GOES OFFLINE.
SRSLY???? You know you're a big gaming company with great experience running an online game RIGHT?? (even Dota's internet is better) I don't think Valve is fully prepared for this game at all. Totally disappointed.
There must be something I'm not getting with this game. $20 and no custom deck to play after the tutorial???. I have to buy ALL my cards??? Servers are down??? Heroes deploy to a random spot within the lane??? Minion spawns are random??? Attack directions are random??? Am I watching a movie or playing a game here???? Cringe af. If there isn't a major overhaul for this RNG and monetization, it's gonna be a FAT refund for me.
Bought the game on launch for the chance to get good cards and sell them for a high price at the wild market for the first hour.

Still didn't get my starter decks and 10 packs.
No cards or packs either, gg, ride that hype train boys.  Will change when they ready for release.  Was reluctant to throw down cash right away, then they're not able to deliver after they already took your money.  Wait till this is working before you give them anything.

edit: Stuck at logging in in small text at the top.  Issue will probably resolve when they figure out their authentication servers.
Started up the game, played through the tutorial, didnt get the starter decks, card packs or event tickets that I paid for by purchasing the game. Screw this game until they fix this stupid bug
they literally have a page list of every card in the game and you can buy any of them if that doesnt say pay to win especially since you have to buy the goddamn game in the first place
I was extremely hyped before this game's released. After playing couple of hours, my hype's just disappeared and I don't know why. I don't think this game's worth and I recommend all of you who doesn't have this game. Spend your money on something else like eating a meal.
I just don't like the game, sorry. Not that it is bad but... i guess i'm tired by cards games.
And i hate the economic system like in CS/TF2/Artifact etc.
Its hard to put in words exactly, but the games all feel like the same thing over and over. It feels like you're just doing the exact same thing over and over. Most card games vary much more when playing vs different deck, the popular decks which you'll see 95% of the time have the same win con. The colours seem to limit the game more than lead to more varity. Multicolour cards and more viable decks would help and likely will but that not here yet.

On top of that, there is the whole cost of the game. Not balancing because people might get upset because they payed for it sucks. The value of packs sucks massivly, never open any aside from your starting packs.

The best part of this game is the phantom draft, and there is another game which is much, MUCH better at something similar, Slay the Spire!
Very disappinting so far... 99% of cards is either deal damage or heal... Nothing especially interesting and complex. Feels like it should be a free game implemented into Dota 2 to play a few rounds in between matches. If you are looking for advanced CCG then go download Magic Arena - it's "free" and better in every way possible.
Also didnt get any unopened packs, tickets or decks and also cant find any game support where I can report the bug.  I can understand bugs, though this is a pretty big one since the game is unplayable without any cards and to not have anywhere to go for game support is ugh.  Perhaps you should expect something to go wrong and have support ready or at least reachable and not hidden some place that is hard to find.
It's incredibly pay to win. You can't even get cards without paying for them.
No different from a game like magic (the physical version) then, right?
Not really, because if you're anything like me your game will crash every 5 seconds, leaving you completely unable to play the game
Oh, yeah. And after you open your starter pack you can't refund the game.
FUN.
VERY EARLY FIRST IMPRESSION:

The lavish animations take too long.
The voice barks are too frequent and feel forced.
The imps are obnoxious.

All of the above wastes the players time.

Sorry.

EDIT: Surpsrisingly unstable, getting a lot of hangs & crashes.
I liked this game at the start, but I seem to only be able to have fun with my friends now.

Even after the patches, after the incentives to keep playing for unlocks, after the opportunity to gain free packs, I feel the game's population has dwindled so severly I can't find any matches online that feel fair. 

I'm not blaming RNG, or bad draws or arrows or any of that, I'm just constantly matched up against people that are clearly better than me. I've lost every single game except for 2 since the last update, which, is about 15 games. Going 2 and 15 is super demoralizing, and sucks any little fun that was left in the game. I don't feel like I'm learning from my mistakes, I'm instead crushed over, and over and over again in short games by people that know way more than I do.

Valve made a lot of mistakes with the launch of this game, and it has such a tarnished reputation now that I don't feel like I'lll ever have the opportunity to learn alongside equally unskilled fresh players. 

I've given this game an honest chance, but for me, I'm throwing in the towel.
This game makes me want to curl up and rethink my life decisions. Great for realizing your life is garbage and this game stole $20 just to shove the fact that cards are expensive and you'll never win without them in your face.
