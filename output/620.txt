The first Portal had genius, original gameplay mechanics, great story, great level progression, great voice acting, great characters, great engine and such a nice british humour it originated a ton of memes.
If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 1, you are a bad person.

This sequel brings all those qualities to a new level: _the story is deep_, lots of wow moments, graphics is beautiful, much more levels, environments and elements to solve the puzzles, the co-op multiplayer is so fun it's epic.
In my heart and in my mind I have no doubt: _this is the best game ever made_.
If you didn't play, finish and love Portal 2, you understand nothing about videogames.

I have no idea why I waited so long to review this game. Here goes nothing, and I hope you rate this up. If you already know a thing or two or hate reading, visit my Pros and Cons section as it helped many customers decide if this game is right for them!
-------------------------------
[b]Intro[/b]
You know how when you are on vacation and say, "I am so glad it isn't winter right now."? Yeah, that sums up the power this game has on you. When you play the game, it is so...crisp (Vacation-like) and when you have to leave, it is like that miserable winter I was talking about.
-------------------------------
[b]Summary:[/b]
This game, as you should know from some other reviews and through the fact that it is one of the best selling games of all time, leaves an effect on the player. It is a beautiful story-line. You play as a female test subject through the campaign. She (I won't spoil her name) is forced through many tests GLaDOS (a powerful robot who took over Aperture) has prepared for her. You learn a lot about this character as you portal around puzzles of rooms, and a lot is learned about yourself. The programed-to-be "idiot" (whom you will find out through the game) is something to look out for as you think he is helping you escape. It is a clever twist. You will learn that the industry you are escaping from used to be a shower curtain/part factory. Yeah, It will all make sense when you play. 
-------------------------------
[b]Multi-Player[/b]
Then there is the multi-player mode with Atlas and P-body who are trying to free the humans or whatever. That itself (with a partner) is totaly worth a lot of Friday nights. Now that they are implementing items/loadouts into the game (or hats/taunts/clothes/flags to those who are uncertain of the term), the game will be more interesting. Now, I may not have many hours, but I assure you that I have beaten multi-player in about 4 hours, and the single player in 3. I mean, the rest of my hours come from exploring more/community maps. And that is the amazing thing about this game...no matter how many times you have beaten it, it is still fun. Also playing multi-player with a different friend every time makes you find a lot out about their creativity/teamwork/leadership/meatal abilities.
-------------------------------
[b]Other important things[/b]
The many achievements with variety are also something to look on about. There are many things you will NEVER notice no matter how many times you play unless you YouTube some of it. The deeper you dig into the storyline, the more interesting you find the game. There were many rumors that we are still uncertain of, which makes this excellent.

To dumb it down:
-------------------------------
[u][b]Pros[/b][/u]
+Amazing graphics for a non-stop beautiful gameplay. 
+Wonderful audio and music for a great experience. 
+Well-designed maps and challenges. 
+Unlimited maps (user-created). 
+Fantastic story-line. 
+Many users own this game. (Lol I remember the commercials). 
+Holiday sales make buying this game super affordable.
+Gender neutral.
[u][b]++Helps with cognitive brain activity[/b][/u].
-------------------------------
[u][b]Cons[/b][/u]
-Limited story-line (I wish there was more to it, but there is always Portal 1). 
-Some levels take seconds while others take many minutes. (Not really progressive difficulty wise in my opinion, which isn't a bad thing here [spoiler]to me[/spoiler].)
-Limited campaign exploration. (Some repetitive looking levels here and there.) 
-Restricted to the short story line. (However, there are some mods which are amazing, but if you want more, you have to manually download them instead of them being included with the game.)
-------------------------------
[b]My opinionated review[/b]
I would say the cons are so minor that I shouldn't even have mentioned them because it may not make you buy the game. DO NOT let that happen. Get this game. I recommend buying during a sale to get Portal 1 and 2 for a cheap price together for the full experience (because they raised the price of this game recently). This is a classic game and will go down in history as one of the best - revolutionizing the way we think/game. It was such an amazing thought that I hope you guys consider for yourselves.
-------------------------------
[b]Rating[/b]
Out of 100, there is nothing wrong with this game. You may not like it if you aren't creative, don't have friends to play it with, or can't appreciate an amazing "Portal transportation" concept. But listen, you will fall in love with this game and stack hours to it. There is no community to worry about other than wonderfully made maps from users like you. Definately get this game if you don't have it - that being said, my review shouldn't even matter. I would give this a [spoiler]97/100[/spoiler] after all of that. I hope you read everything before looking at my rating.
-------------------------------
[b]Finally[/b]
Thanks so much for reading, so I hope you share the love and rate this review up, as it took some thought to make. If you are still wondering whether you should get the game or not...well it always will be a must-have, and YES! Get it!
~thedubmark
(I write reviews now :))
This game is now 4 years old and a sequel to a game even older.  Yet the quality and unique game dynamic endure.  Mods are still being made for it (get Portal Stories: MEL as soon as you finish this game!!), and it just endures as a classic.  I will play this game in 10 years and it will still be fun.

Buy the orange box, on sale, and get hours and hours of fun 9.7 / 10
The best game ever made by Valve. Great story, beautiful dialogues with funny jokes, interesting puzzles, perfect atmosphere and a lot of fun in co-op with friends. You made a great work, Valve, and thank You for this absolute masterpiece.

GLaDOS is Bae!
What's to say?  Creating a sequel to a classic is no simple task.  But somehow, Valve did it.  They improved Portal every conceiveable way.

If you liked Portal 1, you'll LOVE Portal 2.
this is one of my impulse buying on summer sale and i love it! it was dirt cheap considering how well polished this game is.
this game makes me somewhat feels stupid and smart at the same time.

PS:
if you can't solve one of the puzzle, here is the to-do list :
1. check your surrounding carefully
2. find the exit first, and try to back-trace the route.
3. always think physics with portal, more importantly, momentum. this is the most used physics in this game.
Apparently I haven't written a review for this game, so I guess I will now.

For starters, this game is the reason I got a Steam account in the first place. My brother's friend came over with the 360 disc and I stayed up all night playing. Then, of course, he took the game when he left. I immediately wanted to continue playing,  I was hooked from that point forward. Played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 FPS average. It was worth every second of it, honestly. 

The campaign is, of course, one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming. The difficulty curve is well-done, the humor is always well-executed and there's tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens.
Then, of course, the co-op is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and, of course, another person to cooperate with. I have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike, especially the moments where you have to decide if you REALLY want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partner's relying on.
And, to top it all off, there's a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least time/portals with your friends. To this day I occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobody's beaten them, and it's always a pleasant surprise when someone has.

All in all, the game's simply amazing. If the fact that it's the #1 rated game on Steam with 121,015 Positive reviews to 1,586 Negative doesn't indicate its sheer quality, I don't know what will. It's a great game that came from a time when Valve still made them, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart.
On Steam, the signs of a once in a generation game are as follows:

-It has been out for years but tons of people still play it

-The reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive

-Any negative reviews are just 5 year olds whining or people saying "WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR NEGATIVE REVIEWS JUST BUY IT"

-Even if you've beaten it, you keep playing anyway

-Your friends have it and love it (and if they don't love  it, why are you friends)

There's more, but those are all certain signs, and Portal 2 checks each box with a mark the size of Aperture's entire facility.

This is a truly unique and special game which just about anyone can enjoy. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
One of the most brilliant games ever made. The gameplay, humor, characters, and wittiness are astonishing. The co-op was some of the most fun I ever had. Do yourself a favor and get this AND the first Portal if you haven't already.
Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games made by Valve, an amazing sequel to the classic puzzle game Portal 1, with an outstanding storytelling including perfect levels and memorable characters, that shows how sequels should be made! A must buy on your Steam library.
Portal was sort of a little experiment of a huge company. That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.

　STILL ALIVE?

　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.

　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER

　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.

　ENDLESS TESTS

　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.

　Multiplayer:
　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 
　　Co-op:    ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O
　Storyline:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O
　Graphics:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O
　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺

　

　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.

　　　　[i]VALVe made another good
　　game. With good intelligent humor,
　　charismatic characters and unusual
　　interesting gameplay.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　As expected, nine out of ten [9/10].
One of the best games in my library? Certainly.
One of the best games available on Steam? Most definitely.

This game requires you to think out-of-the-box, and will have you solving puzzles constantly.
The dark humour in this game is hilarious aswell, and that only adds to the great experience.
The singleplayer is great, but solving puzzles with a friend is possibly even greater, and allows for much more complex contraptions. Even after you finish the story, you can download heaps of custom-made community maps, which allows for tons of extra hours. I highly recommend it ;)
People rate with game having like 10 hours and then never play it again. If you are trying to decide if you want to buy the game or not and that really bugs you then I'm here to tell you that you can get a little bit more hours out of the game than that :)
I've bought this game a month ago and I started playing it last week and I'm SAD...

...sad that I didn't start to play it immediately when I bought it
...sad that I didn't buy it earlier - A LOT EARLIER
 
Portal is one of the best physics based puzzler games I've played. Not only are the puzzles challenging, but the game itself has been made a lot of fun as well with those 2 robotic personalities.
Take everything you love about Portal, then times it by five. This game has so many good aspects to it, it's hard to know where to start.

Sound? Witty dialouge, excellent voice work, a really cool soundtrack, and even something as simple as the sounds that the portal gun makes sound awesome!

Gameplay? Addictive.

Story? Really good. There are some parts to the story where I genuinely felt threatened and isolated. 

Graphics? Nothing to complain about.

Although Portal 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games I've played in a while, there are two errors that I find with it:

#1 There are parts in the game where you have to use the "zoom" key to find almost unfindable portable surfaces. I thought this gameplay mechanic was rather silly and annoying.

#2 There are parts in the game where the events that happen don't make much sense, and you wonder why you have to do certain things or why you're in certain places.

Overall this game is one of the best games of our generation, and it's loads of fun. It's good aspects overwhelmingly outweighs my tiny nit-picked errors.
A woman with millions of fan theories about without ever speaking a word.
Intentionally designed to be stupid British cores.
Cruel women cores that are really good at singing.
Turrets with low self esteem.
A man that hates lemonade and sounds like J. Jonah Jameson from spiderman.
A potato that becomes your friend.

Combined together with the one of the most original gameplay ever.

10/10
Portal is back and better than ever! The tests are as mind bending as ever, and they've added new elements, like light bridges and emancipation gates. The graphics are smooth and attractive, but nothing that's going to make your jaw drop. The controls are as simple and effective as the first game. But then, none of that was what worried me. I had no doubt that they would be able to recreate and expand upon the technical aspects of the first game. 

My concern was whether or not they would manage to capture and continue the personality and sense of humor of the first game. I am very pleased to report that the sequel does not disappoint. The sequel pics up right where the first game left off, and GLaDOS holds a grudge. Her insults, passive aggressive comments, and general malice will have you chuckling throughout the game. Your new companion and guide robot also adds to the character of the game, though he can be a bit heavy handed at times. 

If you enjoyed the first game, you will love the sequel, both for its expanded challenges, and its unique personality. As long as you enjoy a good puzzle and have a sense of humor, you will never regret this purchase.
You must be living in a [i]potato[/i] if you haven't even heard of Portal,,

Portal 2 is the latest installment of the Portal series, it is a first person Puzzle platformer with a very nice Single Player Story and also a fun cooperative mode

Would highly recommend playing this with a friend
Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece. The voice acting is some of the best that I've ever heard, the puzzles are just hard enough, the game runs beautifully. It is just enjoyable if you look at the single player. If you've considered buying this game and haven't yet, do it! The only bad part about this game is that, now that I'm finished with it, I can never experience it for the first time again.

Next Target - Co-Op Campaign
I just recently discovered the two games Portal 1 and Portal 2. Just finished the second one today and I was mindblown! It's hands down one of the best games I've ever played. Highly recommend getting your hands on it.

Portal 2 is a mind boggling, hilarious adventure and a great sequel to one of the best games ever made. Co-Op is roughly 5 hours long and single player is only a few hours longer. Don't expect weeks of play from this one, BUT with that said it's still a must buy.
Honestly I'm still baffled and I'm clueless how to start this review. I'm still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel. I can't wait to jump into the co-op function honestly since the singleplayer was this good.

Valve literally took a look at Portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel. They added new general features like a loading screen, which I didn't find mandatory, and you can see where your portals are placed through walls. They stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map. Speaking of puzzles, they added so many, that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel. They added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want.  You have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land. You have bridges to guide you around the map. You also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button. Finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white. Red gel gives you a speed boost. Blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it, mainly for places that you couldn't portal on before.

Obviously the things previously said aren't the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment. The story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences. It also contains a few plot twists here and there. The places you visit are fairly new but you'll visit some well remembered places from portal. Something they also introduced is companions, the most part of the game you'll have a object travelling with you. One of them is a funny little core with a british accent. Aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths. The jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh.

I highly recommend  that you buy this game, and play it for the rest of the day or week. Turn off your notification, because the game doesn't support tabbing, and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story. (Edit:) You also can choose from many maps from the community to test out so you won't get tired of the story and you can still play.
I'm not a gamer - not really. Only occasionally will I find a game that captures my imagination and pulls me into its world. The Curse of Monkey Island was the first to do that, then the first Pokemon games on Gameboy. After that I enjoyed a few titles, sure, but I spent far more time obsessing over cinema or books.

Portal 2 pulls you in like a brilliant book or film. It is crafted with superb empathy for the player's experience, regardless of gaming ability. The story, acting, music and world-building are impeccable. It's at turns eerie, funny, tense and poignant. Every element of the experience is designed artfully and executed with a fluid efficiency that would make GLaDOS proud.  I couldn't recommend it enough.
Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun.
At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.
The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.
One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.
Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.
I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter. 
Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.

[h1]REVIEW[/h1]
[b]Portal 2[/b] takes everything that was done right in the first game and injects it with steroids. It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.

In the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.

After that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.

And to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game.  It is a gift that just keeps on giving.

With the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, [b]Portal 2[/b] rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games.  It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence.  If you haven’t yet tried it, now is the time.  There are hours of entertainment waiting for you.

DAMN this game is good. I think at this point everyone knows what the Portal series is, so I'll just point out some of the highlights.
The story is great with interesting characters and a perfect pace. The plot twists are well done and it only tells you what you need to know. The story is also supplemented by the great humor.
Of course it's a puzzle game, so the puzzles and level design need to be good. Luckily, they're done flawlessly. On top of that the environments are also amazing and add lots to the world.
Once you're done with the story mode there's a level creator that is perfectly made and allows you to do just about anything you want. People have used this to make some crazy and amazing levels. The community, while I'm not sure how active it is now, has always been very helpful and creative. You'll never run out of content as long as talented map creators exist.
Definitely a must play for anyone. It's only $20 and worth every penny.
"Daddy, I want a portal gun".  My 6 year old tells me one afternoon.  "Um, sure, okay" I say.  The idea never enters my mind that he is talking about a video game.  A few days later, I notice something while he is playing Scribblenauts.  Right there in his inventory of scribbly things is a portal gun.  

THE PORTAL GUN.

 "OHHHH!" I say.  Now it hits me.  Where on earth did he see that?  I must be a terrible parent.  Okay.  "Daddy can play for you" , I say with a gleam in my eye.  We proceed to install Portal 1. Right when I start the game, he grabs the keyboard and takes over.  Before I know it, he's blazing right through the levels.  Then, he says, "Let's play Portal 2!"

"Portal 2?"

"YES! I want to play Portal 2!"   Well.  I actually do own Portal 2, so fair enough.  It's been on my backlog for too long.  We proceed to install Portal 2.  And on to the beginning...it's as if we are transported to a movie.  He's a little scared.  I ask him if he wants to stop it's okay - it may be too scary.  He squirms around, but as soon as the puzzles start he is ALL OVER IT.  Wow, this little guy really knows how to play.  Physics in a hole - WHATEVER - a 6 year old is blazing through this.  He gets stuck on level 15.  I GET STUCK ON LEVEL 15 TOO.  This puzzle is wrecking my brain, but then I realize I simply did not notice something.  Solved and on to the next.  The both of us play through the game off and on for a few months, he turns 7, and we put in a good chunk of puzzle solving together along with a fair amount of co-op play.  I even bought a controller adapter for a PS controller so we could play side by side.  A week ago we both finished it ( on the really scary parts I let him leave the room ).  I can't remember the last time I had so much fun completing a game with a partner.  My own little guy.  Thanks Valve for making a great game that is a also a wonderful father-son game to play together.  He proudly wears an Aperture Laboratories t-shirt now.

Portal 2 takes elements of adventure, puzzle, platform and first-person action games and blends them into a unique genre mix. It builds on the foundation of its acclaimed predecessor, takes all the gameplay elements that made it great and vastly improves them in every aspect. With that said, I strongly recommend to play Portal first. If you don't you will still play through the sequel without any confusion, Portals plot was minimal (even though exceptionally well-written) and the basic puzzle design is picked up in Portal 2. But you would miss out on a great game and why would you want to do that?

Once again you take over Chell, Portals female protagonist, who finds herself rudely awakened from a cryogenic sleep and imprisoned in a small chamber inside the Aperture Science testing facility, an environment vaguely familiar from Portal - vaguely because a lot seems to have changed since your first time around. Some of the structures at the beginning of the game are indeed places you have already seen during your first escape but this time they are clearly aged, in a state of decay, overgrown with plants and seemingly abandoned. But soon you will have to make your way through unknown terrain and new test chambers that turn out to be anything but abandoned. Fans of Portal will be pleased to learn that GLaDOS makes its reappearance. Something else is different right from the start: You are now accompanied by a british-accented robot named Wheatley, who insists that an escape can only be accomplished together.

Portal 2 really shines in the writing department, the story is much more developed compared to the first installment. Many unanswered questions are revealed, such as bits and pieces of Aperture Sciences history and the origin of GLaDOS personality. Where GLaDOS was Portals only speaking character you now get to hear your goofy sidekick Wheatley and, through pre-recorded messages, Aperture Science founder Cave Johnson. All voice actors did an outstanding job and manage to really bring all three speaking characters to life.

If you played first-person shooters before you will be instantly familiar with the controls, mouse for camera movement, WASD to move, space to jump and left & right mouse buttons to shoot your portal gun. All game mechanics from Portal like pressure buttons, disintegration fields and of course the eponymous blue and orange portals, that are surprisingly simple in theory but make for surprisingly diverse and challenging puzzles, made it into the sequel and in addition many more are added: different sorts of gel that let you jump higher or run faster, catapults, light bridges, air tubes and lasers. Each element of its own already makes for complex puzzles but once the game starts to combine several of them you're in for a real challenge.

Compared to its predecessor, the game provides a lot more content. Not only is the single player campaign about twice as long, it even adds an extensive second co-op campaign. Two players open a lot more puzzle opportunities and the devs managed to use them to their fullest. But don't worry, you are given various means of communication. It's recommended to simply plugin your headset and make use of Steams voice chat feature but even if you don't you can still highlight spots by simply pressing a key, start countdowns to synchronize your actions, open a small screen that lets you look through the eyes of your co-op partner and perform small gestures to communicate non-verbally. Or you could just utilize the ingame chat to write.

But it doesn't end here. Thanks to user generated content the replayability is almost unlimited. When you mastered both campaigns, just tap into the huge library of player generated chambers, even whole campaigns are available to download, and keep playing with ever new challenges.

When you compare the visuals to Portal you cannot help but appreciate the excellent graphic design. While Portals test chambers looked bland and lifeless, they're now impoved with many small details. You have moving, transforming environments, plants growing through cracks in the walls and especially the vast, subterranean areas later in the game are a stunning sight.

Long story short: Portal 2 takes the premise of its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level. A game for the books.
Ah, how I remember having first played this with a friend, and then my boyfriend. He and I did the Coop together, prior to doing the single-player mode. Bothwas definitely a blast!

Portal 2 has all the ingredients to being a great physics puzzle game, along with the interesting story in the solo-mode. For Coop, you play as Atlas or P-body who must solve all the puzzles presented in each stage, as instructed by GLaDOS. I will not go into too much detail of who GLaDOS is, but this feminine voiced AI is not exactly the brightest guide, with good intentions. She has made sinister comments towards the players, or individually as a way to cut down trust and teamwork, despite the entire point of Coop mode being working together. I’ve heard GLaDOS mention things like me performing better than my partner, and vice-versa as well as hints of betrayal. All of which I find hilarious. Both Coop and Solo mode has these factors, which keeps the entire game very interactive and thrilling, despite Portal 2 being a puzzle game. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our times of thinking, testing and trying tricks and tactics to get the level cleared.

In solo mode, we continue off from it’s prequel, playing as the main character Chell, who mistakenly stars up GLaDOS while in the Aperture science laboratory. GLaDOS is, of course, the antagonist [spoiler]at least for the first half[/spoiler]. We’re guided by Wheatley, another AI residing in Aperture Science for some period of time [spoiler]until GLaDOS is taken down[/spoiler]. Regardless of which mode you play, there is also some fourth wall breaking too, where the player is challenged to act against what they are instructed to do. Plot twists and dark truths about the Aperture Science laboratory are implied/hinted within certain stages if you look hard enough.

The graphics and audio are what you’d expect from Portal, if not better. The soundtrack had songs like “Want you gone” and the “Turret Opera” song from the end of the game, which were stuck in my head after completing the solo mode. No complaints here!

My only negative experience for the game is that I was incapable of playing it for prolonging hours due to motion sickness. Portal 2 will have your screen spinning, flipping and some flashing graphics here and there, so make sure you have the settings set right before letting nausea ruin the experience lol.

Steam achievements, a workshop for custom levels, and a scoreboard exists for if you want to play competitively in each stage/level. I love this game, and hope that for some miracle Valve will make a sequel (Wishful thinking on my part). Portal 2 is a must-play if you haven’t done so already!
Wheatley says he has to drop from the rails several feet above me. 

He's nervous about it. 

I promised I'll catch him.

... I lied. 

I watch as he thunks and rolls on the ground. 

He asks me to pick him up. 

I refuse. 

I watch as he entices, begs and cajoles me to pick him up. 

Several minutes later I do. 

Then he asks me to plug him into the wall. 

I decide to dance around the room with him instead. 

The cycle of begging and wheedling begins again. 

After several minutes he gives up and falls silent. 

I plug him into the wall. 


10/10 Would torture Wheatley again.
If you played Portal 1 and liked it, you are going to love Portal 2, it has everything that the previous game had to offer and much more!

The campaign is much larger than the previous one, with a bunch of new mechanics as well. What really shines here though is the fantastic voice acting from the antagonists, Wheatley is hilarious with his british accent and GLaDOS just being cynical and awesome as always!
It has a lot more challenges as well and the multiplayer works perfectly. 

The game is a masterpiece indeed!
Portal 2 is the second and last official installment of the Portal Series, released in 2011 by Valve.

In my opinion, this game adds a lot to the original formula and improves a lot of aspects of the first game, this time you'll have to breakout of a destroyed Aperture Science using your skills, your beloved portal gun and 3 gels that you'll have to master. This are the repulsion gel, the propulsion gel and the conversion gel.

The plot is pretty well written and even you haven't played the first game, you'll undestand the story as the game doesn't require a deep understanding of the first game. The characters in this game feel alive and are very charismatic, from the ironic and twisted GladOS, to the incompetent and dumb Wheatley. The humor is well done and the dialogues, specially in the later scenarios are totally hilarious. 

The aesthetics are amazingly beautiful and also you'll have a lot of this so called screenshot opportunities, even if you are playing with a low end rig, you'll be amazed of the beauty that can spawn from the source engine, an engine that has been around since ages.

And the last but not less important aspect of the game, the soundtrack, from the first time you awake from your long time sleep to the last song, the OST is not only fitting, but also feels like grabbing science and adapting it into an mp3 format. You guys did an excellent job with it, as it adds a lot to the experience.

Overall, I recommend it to every time of gamer and non gamer, if you want to get into gaming, try this game. If you love fps, try this game, if you love puzzles, give this game a go, and if you're a Valve fan, why are you reading this review in the first place? Get the damn game!
One of the best fps/coop games I've ever played.
Hours of fun playing & with friends, the coop just gets better, with lots of challenging puzzles.
A saga with an excelent wit & great background story.

I would totally recommend it.

10/10
Truly one of the most memorable games ever. The witty dialogues, the memorable story, the well-designed puzzles...it all comes together really, really well. I wish for a Portal 3.
It goes without saying this is exceptionally one of the greatest first-person shooter games that doesn't require real bullets, competitive teamwork, accurate aiming, targets and most other common mechanics that are found in that specific genre to make such a fantastic and charming game. This title demonstrates what it always had shown in the prequel; perfect gameplay and immersive story-telling. Thus, this sequel opens the gateway to the remarkable Portal series.

Now, imagine all of those unanswered questions and obscure mysteries that linger within the first game, and how this sequel answers nearly all those said questions with the utmost scientific explanations through the lines of entertainment from this one. From what I could honestly tell you, this game took the first games mechanics, and widened the story much more bigger and exceptionally better. Portal 2 is by far, worthy of the 'Game of the Year 2011' awards.
Now that I've gotten all the achievements and given up so much of my life to science, it's time to review this outstanding game.

--[i]Pros[/i]--
♥ Witty and honestly perfect dialogue
♥ Memorable characters and references
♥ potatoes
♥ Amazing soundtrack
♥ Creative puzzles
♥ Co-Op
♥ Cute mutants
♥ Lemons and a snazzy Cave
♥ $60
♥ You can seriously replay this game over and over again, I'm living proof of it with 150+ hours
♥ Amazing community maps that you can always play if you want more pizzazz

--[i]Cons[/i]--
♦ Neurotoxin
♦ Being called fat
♦ The cake is a lie
♦ Does not include friends for co-op (But there's always a companion cube for you lonely people)
♦ You can't eat the potato
♦ Birds


Okay but seriously, this game will forever stay in my heart. Its originality and engrossing storyline is why it's so beloved by others. No matter what kind of gamer you are, and no matter what kind of mood you're in, you will enjoy the gameplay. Just trust me, try this game. You'll be GLaD you did. <3
[h1]Portal 2 is even better than Portal[/h1]
Portal 2 is another game on my "must play" list. Portal was already incredible, yet somehow Valve managed to make the sequel exquisite. 

[h1]Positive:[/h1]
- Fluid, responsive controls.
- Amazing puzzles, both for single player and co-op.
- Great difficulty curve.
- This time there is actually a story. We finally get to learn more about Aperture Science.
- Wheatley joins the party. In combination with GLaDOS, their unique personalities and humour just make Portal 2 incredible. Basically fantastic script and voice-acting.
- This is not just a remake of Portal. This time gels are added to put a unique touch on puzzles. Basically an upgrade in gameplay and difficulty.
- Co-op mode! Like single-player, the co-op mode is brilliantly designed, and addictively fun. 
- Community-made maps (basically endless fun and challenges).
- Companion cube still loves you <3

[h1]Negative:[/h1]
- [spoiler]Still no cake.[/spoiler]
- You require a competent buddy for co-op.

[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]
Valve really outdid themselves this time. There really isn't much else to say. The praise I gave in my Portal review is just as valid here, although it must be said that Portal 2 deserves even more praise.  [b]You would be a fool not to play Portal and Portal 2.[/b]

An improvement upon the original in every way. An engaging and well-wrtten story that will probably catch you off guard and make you laugh out loud a few times, new ways to solve puzzles, and some sneaky secret areas make this game unforgettable. If the original Portal was a 10/10, this one breaks the scale.
Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in April 2011. Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.

Portal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.

The dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.

The co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.

[h1] [b] Conclusion [/b] [/h1]
Portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it. 

Rating: 8.5/10

[h1] [b] Pros [/b] [/h1]
	- The simple story that ends with an excellent climax.
	- Excellent voice acting.
	- Very good dialogue. 
	- The challenging and increasingly complex puzzles.
	- Length.

[h1] [b] Cons [/b] [/h1]
	- Annoying glitches with the R feedback prompt in single player and frequent crashes via alt tabbing.

- Cheap

- Pretty easy to get the hang of the basics

[u]Cons:[/u]

- Intro music is a tiny bit too loud whenever you open the game lmao


[u]Review:[/u]

Portal 2 is my absolute favourite puzzle game of all time and is my favourite co-op game of all time as well. I still haven't completed the single player story but I still wanted to write this review because of how much I'm enjoying it so far and how much I enjoyed playing the co-op. It feels extremely satisfying whenever you finally figure out a part without looking it up online that you've been stuck on for ages. There never was a part during the co-op that I started feeling bored. The co-op does a great job of making it so that both people need to be doing something instead of just one person doing everything on their own. For the single player you should finish Portal 1 before you start playing otherwise some of the story will confuse you. I struggled to find any cons for this game. It goes without saying, you need to get this classic and don't forget about the co-op.

[u]Rating:[/u]

10/10
Portal 2 is the phenomenal sequal to Valve's award-winning Portal. 

Many were dubious about Portal 2, prior to the release, due to how amazing Portal was, feeling that nothing could live up to it, unless the game were truly amazing. Valve managed to pull that off by miles.

Portal 2 is hugely fun, with a remarkable and hilarious storyline which blends so perfectly from the first game it's almost seamless, with Stephen Merchant bringing an extra layer of awesome as the memorable character, "Wheatley". 

On top of the great story, you have the map maker, which provides hours and hours of enjoyment on top of the original packaged challenges. 

Get it.

Three words...... Best Game Ever

Edit:
[spoiler] A couple years later and I've decided to change my review... "Four words....... Best game ever made[/spoiler]
This game is just.. so beautiful. Everything is done so perfect, the characters, the storyline, the soundtrack, the gameplay, and everything else you could think about. Portal 2 also includes co-op mode, where you can play the game with an friend and experience it again together! Certain puzzles were more difficult than Portal 1 in my opinion, but that's the point of these puzzle games anyway to keep you thinking to solve them! Since it's a Source Engine game, this game will most likely run on your potato too!

I had such a hella amazing time playing this finally after 7 years, despite me being a long-time Valve fan and playing Portal 1 during the times when Orange Box was released in 2007. I really really regret I haven't had the chance to playthrough the entire game for so long. I really want everyone to play and experience this superb masterpiece game, if someone still hasn't played it, like me a while ago!

Definitely 10/10 without any doubts whatsoever!

And..... SPAAAAACEEEE!
Remember when Valve used to create games? This one tops in the brain melting category, you will literally get headaches trying to solve very well thought puzzles. The only game I felt smarter after completing it without the help of youtube walkthroughs.

[b][✔][/b]
> outstanding puzzle design
> brilliant dialogue & comedy
> memorable antagonist(s)
> soothing sound design
> workshop support
> coop side campaign

[spoiler]Portal 3 ples VALVE[/spoiler]

Who would've ever thought that a puzzle solving game could've been made this amazing by providing it with amazing  visuals, storyline, dialogues and multiplayer mode?

Valve is the developer of both csgo and portal 2. One game makes you cancerous while the other makes you smarter.
10/10 brilliant humor and fantastic and challenging levels.. something for the brain and soul! No bugs/problems during gameplay (seven times) and multiplayer co-op. Everything i expect from a game
Portal 2 is the sequel to the hit 2007 game, Portal, where you play as a test subject for Aperture Laboratories, testing a gun that shoots "portals", which you can travel through.

[list]PROS:
[*]Amazing graphics
[*]Highly detailed backgrounds
[*]One of a kind gameplay
[*]Lots of new mechanics
[*]Disney-tier writing (in comedy)
[*]Co-op mode
[*]Thousands of new tests are made every year
[*]Several memorable characters/quotes

NEUTRAL:
[*]Some tests might be too hard for some people

CONS:
I can't think of any... The closest thing to a con is that it won't run [b]as[/b] smoothly as the first if you're playing on an older PC

This is one of the best Valve games out there, and the only good Valve game that Valve didn't fuck up over time
I thank my cousin for gifting me this back in Christmas 2014

11/10
Downloaded it illegally.
Realized my mistake.
Bought it on steam (on sale for $1).
If I could buy it again for the whole price I will.

Definitely one of the best games ever made
11/10
Portal 2 is a First Person Perspective mash of puzzle game and First Person Shooter made abd published by Valve. It is a sequel to acclaimed by critics Portal from 2007. Until now the game was released so far on PC with Windows, Linux and OS X, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. Maybe it is just my imagination but I think being a real gamer and not hearing at peast once about this franchise is nearly impossible.

The plot continoues story of Chell, our mute protagonist after events of the first Portal is still imprisoned in Aperture's facility, this time however she has a new companion, the AI named Wheatley. During they desperate struggle to escape they accidentaly revive GLaDOS, the AI overseeing the entire project. Once again the villainous machine force us to solve puzzles and proceed through test chambers in order to survive. The story is preety great in my opinion, thanks to side characters that can be funny yet convincing all the time really make you enjoy everything, also it has some shocking plot twists and really satisfying ending.
Just as in previous game Chell is armed with the iconic Portal Gun that can create portals on white surfaces, allowing us to move around on very creative ways. Developers also cared to add some new mechanics including pushing streams and various gels boosting our speed or height of jumps. Turrets, buttons etc. The level design often force us to think over all the movements, the solutions are not always obvious so you can spend even an hour in one chamber just on trying out what works and what not.
Soundtrack is not only enjoyable, but also it reacts to what player does. If you walk on orange gel for example the music speeds up for a while, it really adds some immerse to the gameplay.
The game has it's years so at least on modern PCs you can expect flawless performance, frames does not fall ever below 60 on highest settings, besides graphics still look great.

To be honest this is propably the one of the most intense puzzle games you can find on Steam today, story does not dissapoint, gameplay require a lot of thinking, the music fits great and it is all still enjoyable despite the years. If like me you have grown on classic Tomb Raiders or other games that challenge your way of thinking you will enjoy it so much. 10/10.
Amazing game. 

The game is hilariously fun even though it must be considered as a puzzle game, but the conversations throughout the game as you progress through are simply amazing. 
You kind of get a feeling that you just need to continue to the next chapter to get the whole story told while you progress. 

You will eventually figure that robots actually have humour after this experience...
(I would say it's worth the price, if you ever wanted to find out how it is to be a test subject, that is) 

I could keep typing but I have more testing to do in order to get out of here...
Would definitely recommend this game. You have to remember though, it's a thinking game. You might be well acclimated FPS games, but it's always a welcome change. It's grown over the years with add-ons and mods making it even better.
Because I'm a Potato.....

Valve's Portal 2 is the award-winning sequel to the hit game, Portal. I do recommend that you play the first one in order to fully understand the whole story and for you to be familiar with the concept of Portals ^_^

You play as Chell, a mute girl that just does what she does :/ I seriously don't know what's going on in her head xD anyways, you wake up in a room years and years after the events of Portal and the adventure starts there.... Let the testing begin >:) 

Story is well-driven and easy to follow. Although the game features more/less 5 characters (including Cave Johnson and Caroline). They're so lively and have their own iconic personalities, Wheatley is awesome :D You'll never get bored of the dark humor continuously thrown at you xD I have to say that the story is a bit short compared to their flagship game, Half-Life.

The Source engine is by far my favorite. I'm playing this game at a consistent 100fps set to High/Very High.... no crashes in-game, and absolutely looks delightful (especially the lighting). It can also run very well on older systems, which is always a plus for me ^_^ Music is what you'd expect from Valve....... just pure awesomeness, nuff said xD 

Gameplay is the same as the first game. It's not a generic shoot-everything-that-moves FPS but a puzzle-solving FPS that involves Portals and require you to have a keen observation on your surroundings and lots of thinking. I honestly was stuck on a puzzle for a good 20-mins. until I went "Ohhhhh, now I get it" and proceed to finish the test chamber xD It stands out because of its one-of-a-kind gameplay and does it extremely well ;)

Overall Experience: I have yet to try out the co-op mode, but the single-player campaign left me wanting more. That feeling you get after solving a test chamber is quite awesome ^_^ and doing it again, but faster, feels even more rewarding. Although I have problems launching the game (It just might be my Steam client) the game itself runs incredibly smooth. I give this game two-thumbs up ;)
[b][i]A simply ingenious puzzle game. I can't even imagine how much time it took for the creators to make this game.[/i][/b] 


Portal 2 is a unique puzzle game where the player must follow a stupidly humorous robot to escape the lab that they are stuck in.

 Overall, the game was complex and intriguing, with many laughs along the way. This game is very frustrating, so if you don't enjoy getting stuck while playing a game then this game is probably not for you. Otherwise, Portal 2 is a fun game that is interesting to all types of gamers. 

There is a co-op  gamemode, but it's only available for local gameplay (don't quote me). There is also a steam workshop for this game so you can play community made maps.

Portal 2 is not really worth $20, because the story mode gives you around 10 hours of gameplay. However, the game regularly goes on sale. Buy it at its cheapest price ($3.99).

Definitely a must buy for all clever gamers 10/10 

[spoiler] Portal 3 confirmed [/spoiler]
Portal 2 is a great game. It did everything perfectly: action, length, humor, and Wheatley. Everybody should buy it. Now i am going to go wait for Portal 3
This game has a level of polish rarely seen, and some of the best voice acting in any video game to date. Valve took the original and without removing any of the charm created a much deeper and more fleshed out game-play experience. portal 2 is truly a fantastic game.
Thinking once again, with Portals.

Portal 2 is the numbered sequel to the classic first person puzzle game, Portal. Chell must once again trek through many, and I mean many tests that are littered around the facility. This time she is accompanied with the Core, Wheatley, who is a nice fresh change to the original Portal where you're alone, except for GLaDOS, who is here once again to test and "help" you.

Firstly, the gameplay. Portal 2 keeps many of the same physics and gameplay elements from the first game such as falling into portals to gain some speed or height, And the use of the Sentry Turrets. However, that doesn't mean new elements are added, such as new types of cubes and the 3 different types of Gels. Yes, there are three, not including the water. Each of the tests challenge you with puzzles galore and it is very satisfying to figure out a puzzle by yourself. The only times I had to look for a guide for assistance was during some of the non-test puzzles, like getting into the old test-chambers, or getting stuck in a room without the proper-test requirements.

Secondly, the Story continues from Portal as you once again take control of Chell and complete the various tests that have been brought before you, in order to complete your goal of escaping the Aperture Facility. Its a nice story to buy upon on what the original Portal gave us. 

Thirdly, as the time of this Review I haven't played the Co-op mode yet, however, I think its a very good idea as it is technically more fun to solve puzzles with a friend. Another thing is the inclusion of Steam Workshop support, which expands your testing chance greatly as you have a plentiful selection of test chambers.

Overall, Portal 2 is the perfect sequel to Portal, its expanded on its portal based puzzles, added new elements to the puzzle process, and include a new Co-op mode. And Steam Workshop support is a great bonus to add to this game. The single-player mode took me around 5 hours to complete, which is a good chunk of game if you're only using the Single-player. Hopefully we'll get some more Portal goodness
In my opinion thats the best puzzle game and there is not much more i could say. It`s only flaw is that  both solo and coop campaign have their end ;(
I cannot believe it took me this long to write a review about this game. I wrote an essay about how good it is for an English class before I wrote a review talking about how good it is.

Long overdue, I honestly don't even know where to begin with this masterpiece. This game is hands down the best one I have ever played in my life. An improvement on the first one in all the right ways, this game is potentially the only singleplayer experience I have had a proper craving for, the only experience that I have genuinely felt that going back and replaying is the thing I want to be doing.

In the essay that I wrote about Portal 2, I spoke at length about all of the fancy rhetoric that the game employs to convey various emotions and force the player into a mindset. The big thing I noticed was how well the game uses the physically small map to portray this MASSIVE sense of scale. In the essay I focused more on how it forces the player into experiencing something akin to a "trapped freedom", where you have the opportunity to do whatever you want but in a certain space. In retrospect, I should simply have written about the way that the game conveys lonely companionship, fearful trust, and reliance on someone openly trying to kill you. It tears out your deepest emotions and plays with them, trying to and succeeding in making you feel two conflicting emotions simultaneously. This is a powerful way to write a story and Portal 2 pulls it off flawlessly.

With a mix of top-tier voice acting, fluid animation, realistic interactions, interesting characters, an amazing story, the usage of a silent protagonist, and the lack of cutscenes entirely, the game feels realistic and involved. The game doesn't break immersion for a second. While remaining tense, it manages to employ humour, and does everything tastefully.

I can't rave about everything in one review because it frankly will turn into another 20 page essay like the last one did. The TL;DR of this is that the game does everything a game should do flawlessly.


This is the best game ever made and nothing can change my mind.
Fresh sequel to Portal with more humor and more content
Interesting puzzles and a much more realistic/gritty tone than the first installment

i mean you'd pretty much have to live under a rock if you're on steam and don't know what porta-

You're LOST if you don't know this Game!
Glorious adventures are awaiting YOU!
You'll become a LEGEND 🥃

It's my personal Prequel of Tomb Raider.
Great to build with a variety of different 
blocks in a 3D facility , requiring creativity
from potatoes.
Portal 2 will forever stand the test of time. Portal 2 solves the rare occasion where its precursor failed, improving on an already astonishingly great video game.
Oh Portal, what can I say about this time honored game that haven’t been said before. Nothing. Why are you reading a review of Portal 2!? You know what this game is! You know that it goes on sale for $2 practically every day. Just buy the dang thing! 

This is a quality game with a fanatic story backed by solid game mechanics. Portal opts for just a few characters and focus the story on them instead of multiple characters that aren’t as fleshed out. The puzzles are truly where this game shines (no duh) I wouldn’t be surprised if I legitimately became smarter after playing this game. If there is one word to describe this game it would be polished. This is a great game! 

I almost forgot the best part! Even though it’s been over 7 years from release, the community is alive and well! The level editor is absolutely awesome and it’s so fun to play through community created levels and share them with friends. That’s how I have put so many hours in.
Just buy the game.
This game is AMAZING. It has amazing story, new characters, and even more puzzles! After beating Portal in less than a day, this took me at least a couple months to beat! I also LOVE wheatley and the side plots. 5 out of 5 potatoes from me.
Absolutely great puzzle game. Beat it quickly as it was not my first time playing through it, but it was just as fun the fourth time. Also includes awesome co-op that is fully realized and full of content.
Portal 2 is a sequel to my favourite game Portal. In lenght the game is about twice as long then the original one and features multiple aestetics like broken overgrown test chambers, ruins of old Aperture and cobbled together Chambers. It is unique and really good and there is a lot of good to say about Portal 2, but I am going to focus on things that i did not like... The movement of Chell is much weirder then in original Portal / the controlls are just a bit off. Other then like one chamber there are no nice and clean rooms not like Portal 1 had clean and shiny rooms but here its rather busy and I kinda got sick of the broken old Aperture. Also this game feels like its more humorous then the original one.Also also it kinda tried to be Team Fortress 2 in that sence that you can buy vanity items in co-op mode for real money as well as some TF2 hats transfered themselves into Portal 2 (did not work for me tho for some reason) But these are just my gripes with it, it is still a great game and i recommend it to every Portal 1 fan.
Great game.

You know those Hulu commercials where they say "Don't get Hulu it ruins TV forever" this is the same thing.
"Don't get portal 2 it will ruin video games forever"
(Also you'll be so hooked you'll be dying for the third release)
this is an amazing game with intriguing story and puzzles that get progressively difficult the more into it you get. theres also an extreme amount of easter eggs just waiting to be found not to mention the entire multiplayer section and community levels! i was not at all disappointed by this game.
This game is incredibly well written and funny. Valve managed to actually make a successor to Portal that is worth the name.
I had a great time finishing the single player and playing coop with a friend. I do wish the puzzles were a little more challenging but the story makes more than up for that.
Yeah most fun to play with a friend. A complete blast almost ruined our friendship when we would deliberately fuck each other up. Highly recommend but maybe wait for a sale as it can be found for about Au 2.90 pretty often.
Some puzzles really got me working my brain, i applaud the devs, the passion and the small monologue is indeed funny, i loved the prequel, this one keeps up if not story continuation of the previous title. 10/10 puzzle game

P.S: Dont make Portal 3...let this game be a relic of it's genre!
Portal 2 is where you complete puzzles. Plus you can create your own rooms. I made some rooms and they were easy, but the hard part was getting people to try it and that is an issue. Another thing with Portal 2 is that you get to play multiplayer plus voice chat while playing. Otherwise, I think this game is fun. Try it for yourself.
Great Game story line is a little rough but its fun too see the environmental story telling, puzzles were more difficult than the first nut were pretty simple once you figured them out
READ MY USERNAME.
I'VE HAD THE USERNAME SINCE 2012, ON THE XBOX 360.
I GREW UP WITH THAT USERNAME ON XBOX LIVE.
ALL MY ONLINE LIFE, I'VE HAD THAT USERNAME.
WHY?

Because of Portal 2.
My parents surprised my young self with the Xbox 360 copy of Portal 2.
I played that damn game for an unhealthy amount of hours.
When I first made my Xbox Live account in 2012, my Mother asked me what I wanted as my Gamertag.

I still loved Portal 2, so I came up with it on the spot. Ninjas sounded cool anyway.
"The Portal Ninja!"

I imagined an amazing Portal 2 player that can speedrun Portal 2 glitchless, spinning through portal after portal, like a ninja.

I'll never change my username no matter what, because this is how much this game means to me. I may not play it as much today, but I still love going back to it. I'll never uninstall it.

Most of all, I'll always come back if there ever is, somehow, a Portal 3.

If you don't have this game, [h1]I'd recommend dropping everything to play this right now.[/h1]
Dig into your bank account, your 401k, mortgage your home, anything. Buy this game and play it.

I don't lie nor over exaggerate when I say that this game has changed my LIFE.
   This is one of the greatest games I have ever played. If you haven't played the previous version you will still find the story entertaining and simple to understand. The Co-Op is one of the most fun co-op puzzlers if you have a friend. It is challenging but overall fun. Love it.

Conclusion: ☑

I absolutely love this game, the experience it gave me was very memorable. There was never a dull moment while playing it, I'm not that smart but this game shows that even dumb people can actually solve puzzles! I didn't look up any walkthroughs or tutorials and I'm very proud to say that. I have already finished the first game prior to playing this one, the things that I loved from the first installment came back with additional mechanics, and the story, it picked up from the last game with a twist. The length of the game left me satisfied because it was just right, not too short, unlike the first game and not too long. Miku Hatsune gave us yet another astounding song, although I liked the first one better.

I'm looking forward to a third game if ever there are plans for it, but I guess there's no hope until Half-Life 3 is confirmed.
Good game, lots of fun. I got it and Portal 1 in a sale bundle for 5$, really good game, you can get on sale for super cheap and if you have a friend try doing the co-op. In co-op the game AI is trying to get you and your friend to compete (not actually but its part of the story) but its so relaxed and fun anyway.

A good game, worth the 10 dollar money and has a long, moddable gameplay. I like games with the Steam workshop on them so this is a nice game, but it is still partially hard to actually find out where to go. Hopefully Valve continues working on this in the future.
