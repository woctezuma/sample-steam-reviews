This game made me so miserable . 
The writing can be as funny as heartbreaking 
The Voice acting is one of the greatest i've ever heard 
A lot of the time , the many side quest were as awesome or even better than the main story (That is already amazing )

Pro : The whole game 
Con : Absolutely nothing 

It's one of the greatest gaming experience I've ever had in my 24 years on this earth.

I have never played a game quite like The Witcher 3. You literally feel like you are Geralt, and you become connected to all the characters asif they really were your family.


Summary:

I would highly recommend The Witcher 3 to any RPG/mass content hungry gamers, it is a masterpiece.
 


Game devs take note, CD Projekt Red actually make finished uncut games, plus DLC'S.

500/10 would Witcher again

YEN PLZ MOAR I LUV U
I am 75 years old and really enjoyed this game. In this game I could do all the things I was once able to do but in my twilight years can no longer do. There should be more games like this for us seniors. The graphics were exellent. I very much dislike and dismiss the cartoon type graphics in most other games. The visual aspects of the game were superb, realistic and sometimes even breathtaking. The attention given to detail needs to be congratulated. The storyline was only just satisfactory but this was complemented by all the interesting charecters involved. Please continue to amaze us gamers with your excellent work.
The best way to embrace the true greatness of this game is to look on how the series has improved since the first and the second part of The Witcher. You simply won't find anything that hasn't changed for the better.

- Vast open world that IS NOT randomly created and filled with dull stuff,
- Story which engages you from the first 10 minutes to the very end,
- Graphics, even despite the whole controversy of a thing called downgrade, still makes this game THE BEST LOOKING RPG ever created,
- Soundtrack, it finally goes back to the style presented originally in The Witcher 1, something that makes you forget that's just the video game, it gives you the feeling you are in there, in some village, city or that you are fighting with someone / something, which turns every single battle into an unforgettable memory,
- Every single side quest, and believe me, there is A LOT of them, is actually a little story that keeps you playing with the same force as the main quests - I call it - a new quality in RPGs,
- Choices and their impact on the story - even a small choice that seems insignificant at the time can wage on the whole world around you,
- THIS GAME IS MATURE, finally a game dealing with a lot of subjects which are usually handled very childishly or not at all,
- Combat - nothing more to add, it's decent, though it's nothing to be praised really, you won't be able to mash buttons and win - you have to dodge, use signs, and on higher difficulties get yourself ready to have an oil for a specific enemy and a bomb to be able to put an end to his or her misery.

The Witcher 3 is not a game without its flaws, although nothing that can't be fixed - some balance issues, economy basically showing Geralt as a very wealthy person (who he should not be), small performance problems like stuttering in Novigrad and in my opinion very limited after the end content (fixed by the expansions). Many of the things I struggled with have been already fixed and there is no need to disclose them. 

All in all, one of the best games in the last few years (even a decade).
28 years of gaming, this is the greatest game I have ever played and likely will ever play.  Bought it on release day in 2015 and came here todau just to write this because someone asked me at work today if this game was any good.

My only regrets are that no other game can compare to it, and I can never experience it fresh again. It may have ruined all future games I will ever play.

11/10 . Wish I could do it all over again.

[td]9.5/10[/td]
[td]If you play this game on easy, it's a walk in the park, you destroy everything you see, and Geralt is some sort of God who almost can't be killed. On Death March however, everything else is a god and it's so hard to get further in the game.
 I found this the most fun experience, for a reference; On Death March enemies have 80% more health and do 230% more damage, also you only gain 80% experience from everything whilst on this difficulty.[/td]

[td]A big open world, with a lot of things to do, hours upon hours of content after you've finished the main story. Side quests, collectibles, bounties, amazing DLC (some free some paid for).

So we got a game in 2015, the complaint of which for many people was overwhelming content
We got a DLC for the game in 2015 which was better than all the games in the year
We got a DLC for the game in 2016 which was better and had more content than most games in the year
The base game and DLC together costed less than most AAA games of the year

A game that had an artistic vision, a game that wanted to push boundaries in terms of narrative and choice/consequence based decision making in a living and breathing open world, with characters that are memorable and relatable. A game whose developers knew what gamers wanted. WItcher 3 has launched CDPR into the league of great developers like Looking Glass, Rockstar, Valve, old-Bioware etc..... 

My only complain with this game is that it made other modern games feel obsolete.

This is the game of the generation by such a huge margin, it's not even funny.
Just f*cking buy it already.
Play on easy if you want to feel like a god
Play on hard if you want to feel like a witcher
Mods take it from a 10/10 to a 12/10

On a scale of terrible to fabulous
Combat: Good, not great
Story: Fabulous
Sounds/Music: Fabulous
Visuals: Fabulous
Characters: Fabulous
Pacing: Fabulous
Content: Fabulous
DLC: Fabulous

This game should be worth $200, it's on sale for $20.
Step 1: Buy game of the year edition.

Step 2: Clear out your schedule for the next several months.

Step 3: Profit???

Step 4: Life complete. Absolutely nothing that can top this experience. You can die and go to heaven now
Undecided for two years; whether to try the game or not. I ended up buying it on the last sale for 20€, the GOTY edition, and I fired it up a few weeks ago after finding myself bored one night.

This game is probably the best game I've ever played. Everything, from the soundtrack to the story line, is spectacular.
Making a quick resumé of the things that made me fall in love with this unique gem:

-The graphics are insanely good, even more so with mods. The lightning is what every game's lightning strives to be.

-The voice-work of the game. I am amazed at the amount of quality work put into this game; I heard over ten thousand lines, and not a single one of them seemed bad acted, at the contrary, *every single one* was stelar. Never broke the suspension of disbelief!

-The choices. The choices matter, you forge your path. Sure, you might be a witcher, and in the canon sure as hell Geralt wouldn't send an innocent man to jail just because he's a tad bit racist, but fuck it, you're in control here, chief!

-The feelings. I normally have a hard time immersing myself in stories, and they usually don't make me feel at all, but this game was totally different. I've smiled, I've laughed, and I almost cried too. The characters are so well acted and feel so real that you ought to *feel* it.

-The soundtrack! I never thought, in my entire life, that I'd end up with polish folkloric music on my library, and look at me! It really grows on you.

-GWENT. Either you LOVE it, or you hate it. I personally loved every second of it, and I enjoyed collecting cards so much! Kid is in danger? Fuck it, let's play gwent.

-How even though the game is long, it doesn't feel long. Before playing this game, I was afraid that I'd feel obligated to pour dozens of hours of my life, countless days into it, without it really being that entertaining. NOPE. I've been entertained, every single one of my hours. Never got bored.

-Uma.

Honestly, if you're on the verge, and don't know if you might not like it, give it a shot. You might regret not getting it sooner, like I did. 

Not only the best game of the year, but also the best game I've ever played. I'll buy CD Projekt's next game in a heartbeat.

70 hours to complete the main line, and I'm going to start the DLCs tomorrow!

EDIT: Just completed the DLCs and loads of side quests at exactly 100 hours. 

I stand by my words, this is the best game I've ever played. I'm finsihed with it, but I'll probably replay this masterpiece in the future.

I feel empty after completing this game. I know no game shall come close to this, and I know my adventures as Geralt are over. It saddens me.
Nobody will read this because there are almost 200 000 reviews for this game. This game has now stayed relevant and exemplary as an RPG, and just as a game, for longer than it has been in development.


After so many hours, so many adventures, so many life lessons.. I wish I had words to describe this game, but I simply don't.
It is definately the best game I've ever played in my life, it's like a work of art that I'm glad I had the chance to experience.
Every place you go feels so alive, the characters are so well written that most of the time I would get completely immersed into the conversations with them.
When you look back at it after doing everything, every single quest, all the expansions, all the places.. You feel something like a good memory from the past, a feeling of nostalgia..
When people say this game is big, it's kinda hard to understand what it means, for some, it's the map, or the number of quests, or even the size of the campaign, but I believe this game is big on what it tried to achieve, on the greatness of the story that it told, the powerful effects of your choices, the felling you have when you discover a new monster and quickly have to adapt to overcome it, the experience you have when picking up a trail, or sailing through the cold oceans of skellige alone..

So many memories, that with words it's simply too hard to explain, memories that I will always hold dear to my heart.


Thanks CD PROJEKT, simply, thanks.
This game is more than another blockbuster title; it's one of those that defined a chapter in my life. 

I played Witcher 1 when it was released in 2007, back when I was a single man working in my first job few years out of college. I even remember playing it through one of the worst years of my life. 2011 came, Witcher 2 was released and I immediately bought the box set with the soundtrack, coin, and map. A lot of things changed in my life by then and I took on a whole new adventure in career, travel, and even love. Then after many years, Witcher 3. 

After finishing Blood and Wine, the final expansion, I uninstalled and finally closed this magnificent story that has been a part of me for the last nine years.

Now as my wife and I take on a new adventure into parenthood, I know that I won't have time to finish long RPGs anymore so this may be my last hurrah. That being said, this game, its story, characters, lore, will remain with me moving forward, defining what story and videogames can and should be.

Goodbye and see you Witcher. Salute.
Take note game developers and publishers, this is how you make a great game make tons of money and have a positive relationship with your customer base at the same time.

- No microtransactions
- No virtual currencies
- No lootboxes

10/10 CD projekt red will have my business for some time to come =-)
Just finished my second playthrough and I still want more!  I bought this game over a year ago and didn't get around to playing it until recently.  I added the DLC's and all additional content which I must say was well worth the money, especially if you use the content pass that is offered.
I'm not a young man, almost 50 years old and I've been gaming since I was 14 years old on the Spectrum.  I've played good games and bad and in recent times have become rather annoyed at publishers that promote unfinished or badly flawed games on release, this however is not one of those products.  In fact, after i completed the game for the second time, I went to CD Projekt Red's web site to see what else they had on offer because if they produce quality like this then i'll gladly buy into their world.
The Witcher 3 is, to my mind, THE best game I have ever played.  Why?  Because, from the outset, even though I hadn't played Witcher 1 or 2, the main character was easy to understand and identify with.  The general gameplay is smooth and logical in addition to the gentle learning curve.  The plot, for someone that dives strait in to Witcher 3 is relatively easy to grasp, so much so that you quickly begin to feel part of it all.
The scariest thing is that it's a real emotional roller coaster, after a short while playing, you really begin to empathise with the characters, you'll be laughing out loud, feeling sad, angry and elated.  
I could go on but suffice to say, it's Brilliant.  Other publishers take note!  Well done "CD Projekt Red".

[b]Geralt of Rivia[/b]
__________________________________________

[h1]Introduction[/h1]

'The Witcher III: Wild Hunt‘ has won so many awards and has been praised by so many people that it’s kind of impossible to miss or ignore this game. It’s the third part in the videogame series based on the books by Andrzej Sapkowski and represents the end of the famous videogame trilogy of Geralt of Rivia, a.k.a the White Wolf or the Butcher of Blaviken. To cut a long story short: The game lived up to every expectation I had and exceeded them with ease. Even the games‘ minigames are better than many full-price titles – yeah exactly, I’m talking about you Gwent, you awful little drug that I can’t get enough of…

The main story connects to the events of the second Witcher game 'Assassins of Kings‘ and brings the overall story started in the first part to an end. Witchers are infamous monster hunters, magically improved mutants that are simultanesously feared and needed in a world threatened by dark creatures, evil spirits and living nightmares. Geralt of Rivia is a famous specimen of this kind and thought for a long time that his former friend and love, the sorceress Yennefer of Vengerberg, was already dead. However during the recent events in Loc Muinne he learned that this was not the entire truth and so he decides to start a new journey to finally find answers to his questions.
 
A huge world with fascinating lore and characters awaits the White Wolf - the sheer quantity of places you can visit, persons you can talk to and monsters that have to be slain would be enough to  fit in several other games. 
This world is not only packed with interesting stories, dialogues, quests, fearsome monsters and an insane amount of details behind every corner, moreover it is convincing and far away from all the happy fantasy clichés you've already seen a hundred times. There is neither black nor white, just many shades of grey. Elves are neither the glorious archers nor the kind tree people, humans not the friendly guys that accept every race the same and dwarfes are no gentle stone-loving miners. In this world you have to make choices that you won’t like and to live with the consequences. Morally ambiguous is the description you’re looking for.
__________________________________________

[h1]Graphics and Audio[/h1]

Regarding the technical aspects this game conquers Mount Olympus easily (despite the much complained 'technical downgrade‘) as it is one of the most beautiful RPGs I’ve ever seen, with amazing sunsets/sunrises, spooky nights and gorgeous views over detailled landscapes full of nature and terror - this game is definitely gorgeous. 

You want to see some examples? Let me show you some screenshots taken from the game using Reshade/E3FX and the free camera from the console:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639380403

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=657195325

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=626638385

In addition to the stunning visuals there is also brilliant music and fantastic voice acting that will catch you during dialogues or pumps you up during the fights. Together with the exquisite characters, the superb dialogues and all the deep little stories the game suceeds even more in creating a credible fantasy world.
__________________________________________

[h1]Cons[/h1]

So now there's the question: Are there negative points at all? 
Yeah some minor flaws: Talking to every person and looting every stash is kind of unsatisfying as there is no wide variety of things that you may accomplish or find this way, so after some time you will visit mostly the important places and persons while ignoring the rest. Furthermore if everything else may be a 10/10 for me, the fighting mechanic is not as fantastic as the rest. It has definitely improved since the second part but it’s still somewhat 'special' as it lacks unique aspects, a good feedback for the hits and suffers every now and then from targeting problems, camera angles, weird controls or some questionable hitboxes. 
That now may sound worse than it actually is - from my point of view it's 'still' an 8 out of 10. In addition I encountered some small visual glitches and sound errors during cutscenes but they were so small and disappeared after reloading, so I don’t even care about this at all. Compared to the games‘ size and content there are nearly no problems at all and everything runs more than just smoothly for me. 

To be honest there is only only real downside that I have with the game: My journey with Geralt will end some day and it set new standards regarding characters, lore and dialogues that future RPGs have to be compared with - and this will be a tough struggle for many of them.
__________________________________________

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

So in the end, would I recommend the game? Yes – and no. 
It’s a fantastic RPG with an amazing amount of content, exquisite characters, dialogues and interesting stories, so I’d recommend it for everyone who has even the slightest positive attitude towards RPGs or the fantasy genre in general. 
However at the same time I wouldn’t recommend the game for anyone who has only little time to spare, doesn’t want to be immersed in a massive world full of lore or just wants to rush the story - this game needs time. A lot of time. However it pays off by providing a brilliant experience that will take you on a journey that you’ll never regret or forget...

…or to be more precise let's call it 'a journey you’d like to forget'. Just to experience this masterpiece again from the start and to get these great feelings again (damn I even ignored the fast-travel option and turned off the minimap and the quest hints willingly for many hours (I’ve been lost so many times) to enjoy the world and the quests even longer). 

I rate it gladly 9.5 out of 10 points.
__________________________________________

Let's end this review with another badass quote of the White Wolf:
'I'm a Witcher. Heard you wondering about my swords. Well, one's for monsters, the other for humans.'
This game is the biggest mistake you can make. After playing it you will feel depressed about how bad all other games are.

It's just so incredibly good, detailed to the last bit, with huge amount of content and far-reaching concequences of player choices. Graphics and sound are amazing. Both main and secondary quests are of top quality. Witcher contracts can be a bit repeatable, but stay complex and interesting nevertheless.

It's a must-play before you die. Just be sure not to spoil yourself all other games accidentally.
[h1][b]An introduction[/b][/h1]

The Witcher 3 is certainly a game that has been hyped since it was released, and it still is, to some degree. I am sure that you've heard a lot about how this game is so great and blah blah blah. Sure, you can believe that and try the game yourself, but today I want to give you an honest review about what makes this game so loved. Buckle up, buckaroos.

[h1][b]A quick look at the story[/b][/h1]

At a first glance, it seems that everybody plays this game because Geralt is so popular among the fans. He is, and with good reason. Geralt is a witcher: a monster hunter traveling the world far and wide in search of contracts on monsters only people like him can take down. He's got the full set: bombs, swords, potions that make him 10 times more badass than he already is, allies, etc. Witchers are trained to hunt monsters by passsing "The Trial of Grasses", a chemical procedure that injects potions into young boys to sharpen their senses, give them strength, speed, dexterity and the unforgetable cat eyes. 
The full lore is, of course, way deeper than this quick explanation. From The Witcher 3 is about (I reccomend playing the Witcher 2 before this or at least reading some of the books, to understand the lore better since it can be a tad bit confusing at first) Geralt's odyssey to find Ciri and Yennefer, his "daughter" and his lover, in a race against time to save the world from The Wild Hunt and the White Frost. Going into the story anymore than this would mean spoiling the experience for you. Once you get to play the game though, you will experience for yourself the loveable characters, develop a bond with Geralt and feel like you are actually a part of the game's world.

[h1][b]The gameplay[/b][/h1]

The game features classic rpg elements. The gameplay is pretty straightforward: you do quests to acquire better gear and level up, rinse and repeat. Even so, the side quests are not the basic "go there, kill that many things, come back" type of quests. They all have their each own unique little side story which gives the game even more flavour. They are memorable and fun, unlike other rpgs these days. 
The main quests feature choices which leave a mark on the game's world and truly affect the story. The WItcher 3 also features treasure hunts for better gear and quests that you can actually fail, adding an overall more realistic feeling to the already complex game. 
The map is huge, the vanilla version featuring 4 different regions. There is plenty to do other than explore. From finding easter eggs to clearing the places of interest on the map, I can guarantee you won't have time to be bored in this game. Other systems like crafting weapons and armor to forging runes are also a major component of the game, with Witcher armor sets blueprints to find and legendary weapons to forge or collect. Every artisan in the game's world has a certain level of experience and can only forge gear up to that point. To forge better and better gear, you must find the master and eventually grandmaster (in Blood and Wine) craftsmen.

[h1][b]The combat system and skills[/b][/h1]

The Witcher 3 features a variety of skills and builds you can choose. Like wearing light armor and casting signs from afar? No problem! Like engaging in swordplay and slaying your enemies with graceful finishing moves? No problem! Like not even fighting? Sure thing, you can even control people's minds to do just that!
The plethora of ways in which you can play this game is most welcome, since it makes the game have a very high replayability value, both from a story perspective (you can experiment with choices and try to get different endings) and a gameplay perspective (even though you can change your build on the go with a Potion of Clearence which resets your skill points). 
The game has quite a basic fighting system. You can get close and personal with the dual swords Geralt features (steel for men, silver for monsters) and either perform light/heavy attacks, parries and counter attacks (there are skills which expand the swordfighting with special moves and finishers) or you can fight from afar with signs like Igni, Yrden, Aard, you name it. The signs are powerful spells which can be modified by skills as well. Overall, the combat system feels great. You can also install mods (the community has plenty of them, especially on Nexus) to make the experience even better.

[h1][b]Graphics and soundtrack[/b][/h1]

This game has absolutely beautiful graphics, which hold a place among the top even in 2017, almost 2 years and a half after its release. Everything from the grass to the monsters and rocks looks amazing! The soundtrack features masterfully composed music that fits just right in every situation, be it combat or just peacefully exploring the amazing map. 

[h1][b]The DLC[/b][/h1]

The two expansion packs, Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine feature so much content that they almost match the game time you get in the original version of the game. Hearts of Stone is a beautiful story about Olgierd von Everec, an immortal man who has been cursed with a heart of stone, whose content adds roughly 15 more hours of game time, and Blood and Wine even features a whole new region of the map to explore and complete quests in, which adds another 35 hours of game time. 
Hearts of Stone features a whole new crafting system called enchanting, which allows you to enchant your gear with the help of a runewright. In Blood and Wine, all crafting systems are expanded with Grandmaster craftsmen, which can forge grandmaster armor and weapons. Just like the main game, the expansion packs are also full of choices and can have different endings. If you have your mind set on buying the game, go for the GOTY version.

[h1][b]Conclusion[/b][/h1]

This game is a masterpiece in my opinion. It satisfies all of the gamer's needs a modern rpg should satisfy, while also offering endless hours of playtime and replay value. If you are at the very least interested in rpgs, you will enjoy this and immediately fall in love with the wonderful cast of characters, making you want to play the game more and more. It also has that unique je ne sais quois that no other game can match. The current price of the game is a solid deal, guys (20$). I reccomend buying it. You won't regret!
This is the greatest game ive ever played in my life (ive been gaming since Pong/2600). My time played is bordering on embarassing, and its going to get worse with BaW just released. This is my comfort game, whenever I am bored of another game, I can always come back to this one. I also played through W1 and W2 multiple times (not on Steam) so I was foaming at the mouth for years, waiting for this game.

I'm the kind of gamer where I need more than just a story, I want a great story, great loot/crafting/item management, great combat, and great character RPG skill building. This game has it all, and its completely adjustable. Only want the story and swinging your sword at monsters but dont want to get into crafting/alchemy/skills? Just play it on the easiest and you can skip all of that, and just watch the story (Naughty dog/telltale style). You want to get hardcore and make all the crafting/oils/bombs/potions/thought into char build usefull? Turn it on Death march and make all your desisions count and make all the battles extremely fun and tacticle. 4 of my 5 playthroughs are on DM and it is the true Witcher 3 experience.

Games with great stories alone just dont cut it for me anymore. A good example of this recently was Uncharted 4, dont get me wrong it had a great story, but after the Witcher I was bored to tears and still havent finished it. In that game you do nothing but shoot at stuff and watch the story, which is fine for some people but not me. In Witcher 3 you get a GOT quality of a story, including voice acting, animation, ect. However when you want to take a break from that, visit one of the equally engaging side stories and monster hunts, go on scavenger hunts for treasure and 6 different sets specialized witcher gear, 4 of which have 5 tiers of upgrades. Go visit question marks on the map for more side stories and treasures, hunt down rare ingredients for your potions/bombs/oils. Theres all of that and I havent even talked about Gwent yet....  You will also be collecting cards rare and common through out the game world for an entire card game built from the ground up as a mini game within this game. The game is so fucking good that they are now releasing it as a full game because everyone went ape shit nuts for it. Ive played so much Gwent that I know what the computer is going to do before they even do it.
I could go on and on, but bottom line.......this game has set a new mark in all the gaming industry for other compaines to aspire to. CDPR for fucking life.

Pros:
Everything, it has it all. This is the equivelent of gaming super crack
- Great char building and skill trees, even better now with BaW DLC
- A very well done and responsive battle system that gets even more fun and tacticle as you turn up the difficulty. The only *sword fight simulator* that is better is Dark Souls.
- Tons of weapons, armor, and crafting, including all the Witcher specialized sets that change their look with each upgrade.
- One of the greatest game stories ive ever seen, which may have only been topped by its own DLC in Hearts of Stone. Top notch voice acting, animation, and choice/dialog system.
- Fucking Gwent
- A vast living, breathing open world only rivaled by GTAVs open world for scope and detail.
- Details, details, details, a huge amount of love and time were poured into this game. I spend hours just looking at stuff and admiring all the little things.  (see hours played)

Cons:
It will ruin all other games for you. Everything else is now harder to get in to because of this. So, you know.......be careful
Pros
+ One of the best RPG that ever existed
+ It's Geralt of Rivia
+ Can't argue about graphics more
+ Worth your every d*mn penny
+ You'll enjoy the storyline and never bore with it
+ 10/10 for DLC

Cons
- it takes a lot time out of your life

10/10 for CDPR, and dear other devs, please take note that being greedy with lootboxes and microtransactions won't get you anywhere
It was an amazing journey.

I started playing this magnificent game in previous year and faced with the one thing (rare actually) i was scared to complete this game. When i was playing, completing mission after mission, i was think about end of the game and didn't want to see that, even to think about that. I was living this life, witcher life. I was traveled from village to village, from city to city, from forest to another forest. I met a lot of different , unique characters. Their voices, looks, demeanor , looks on world problems and world were different. Yes, it's unbelievable. In game you don't have the main mission - complete the game now. You can travel, look at all over places, beautiful places, landscapes, abandoned towers and castles, shattered camps . It's very atmospheric. I started using teleport only after 300 hours in this game. And now, when i finished the main story, i have plenty of the side-missions, contracts, and  thieves, bandits in my world. It's time to solve those misisons. When i was playing, i was full of emotions. I was like "ohh, i want to be here, in this game". On the weekends, i was making a 2 cups of a tea, closed door to my room and playing...or...lived? I'm still thinking, that my real life such a boring show... I was filled good emotions and worry. I was worrying about heroes.They became like a family to me. I felt that im part of this story. Now i'm writing review and i dont know my mood. It's a good and i think that something isn't completed yet. Why everything good have an end? Okay, those missions are for 50 more hours, but after that... The journey of the witcher isn't end. For me , this place - home. If i could change my life, choose any places to move to ( doesnt matter , move to place in real life or game ) i would like to live in this world. World which i like.

Am i need to say something about graphics? About sound? 
*It's awesome. Everything in this game is awesome.

The only bad thing about this game - is the emptiness you feel, after finishing it. And thats true. 
You know... Not each game can take your heart. This game did it. I mad about Witcher series, so, i'm gonna buy statuettes of all characters. I'm even thinking about to make other shelve, special for the witcher. It's unrealistic to explain your thoughts about something you love more than anything else. 
Perhaps, some of you guys will understand me , someone - not. But i want to tell you one thing - buy it, feel it. 
You have to feel it on your experience. These emotions after this game it's like a storm you can't stop.

I want to say big THANKS to the developers, to the CD PROJEKT. 
Guys, you are my favorite company. You gave me in this series more , than i got in my real life. Actually, every work week i was waiting the friday evening, run home and i knew, that now, for this weekend im finally free. And it was from week to week. And on these weekends i finished this game (main story). To be honest, i don't even know what i have to feel, i feel  emptiness. 
I really love you and thank you, CD PROJEKT. 

You made the Masterpiece!
i already played this game on pirated version about 70+ hours, but i bought it because of the gameplay, story, and graphic are not deserved to be pirated. still the best game i've ever played
I've been a gamer most of my life, starting with my first Atari 2600 in the early 1980's. This is the greatest RPG I've ever played. I've used Steam for many years now, and never written a review for a game before...this game was good enough to make me feel like I should.

Looking back on it, I feel like I actually played several games. The overall storyline contained so many sub-plots that each "chapter" felt like its own complete game. I've heard some people mention this as a negative, but I can't possibly see how. It's value...you don't have to play the game if you don't want to. If you only want 40 hours of content from a AAA title, then quit playing it after 40 hours.

As for the quests themselves, I found even the random mini-quests generated from "undiscovered locations" to be well-executed and thoughtful, some of which would only take a few minutes to complete, but added genuine character to the gaming world, making it feel like a real place. After over 170 hours of play, I found myself saving the final quest and just roaming around Skellige checking out undiscovered locations, even though I knew the vast majority of them were smugglers caches, and I already had all the gear and crowns I could ever use...I didn't want it to end. I anxiously await the next DLC expansion.

I hear a lot of people complain about the combat system as well, and for the life of me I can't understand why. In close quarters the camera gets a bit wonky, and it's hard to maneuver properly because of your view being obstructed, but that's only in a few specific places. The combat system is elegant in that it is as complex as you make it. You can finish the game quite easily doing nothing but blocking/countering if your opponent is human, dodge/attack if your opponent is a monster. Now add to this basic and extremely effective routine the use of the various bombs, potions, decoctions, and signs, especially in conjunction with area effects and each other...there are a thousand ways to defeat your opponents. Throwing a gas bomb and lighting up a bunch of bandits with Igni is always entertaining, as is using Axii to make a guy kill his buddy. Some special attacks you can unlock, like Whirl, are just amazing to watch when you pull it off correctly to take out a whole group of enemies in one fantastic display of swordsmanship.

Gwent is another feature that gets a lot of attention, and I really didn't know what to make of it at first. After analyzing it for a little while, and picking up some different cards with different abilities, I began to realize the genius of it, and eventually got to the point where I can honestly say I haven't had as much fun with an RPG mini-game since Triple Triad in FF8. It's just another part of this game that is absolutely brilliant in its simplicity yet astoundingly deep.

Well, there you go. My first Steam review. I enjoyed this game immensely, and unless you're a cave troll, you probably will too.
I admit I was a bit concerned over the few years that The Witcher 3 was being developed. Hearing how CD PROJEKT RED decided to go "open-world" and make the game 30 times larger than the previous Witcher games. These games were always more about substance for me and "open-world" games tend to lose some of that. I wasn't so sure it would work. Then, the game then was delayed in 2014. Wasn't a good sign for me. 

Soon after it was released, I picked it up. I spent the first few hours just taking in how beautiful and detailed the game world is. The water, trees, animals, grass..everything felt alive. I started playing the game and got hooked. The main questline itself was full of characters you grow to love and care about and a story that you typically don't get in a video game. The side quests in the game weren't your typical "fetch this" or "Kill this" type..all of them had a story and decisions to make on how to complete them.

The combat seemed clunky at first but then you start to realize this isn't a button mashing game, patience and timing was the way to go. It can be on the easy side on the normal difficulty levels, especially when only using your sword for combat but it gets more interesting when you start to use alchemy and signs. 

In the end, I couldn't believe how great of a game this ended up being. The game's production values and writing are some of the best I've ever seen. Although I spent 150+ hours in my first playthrough of this game, I was bummed it was ending. Rarely do I feel like that after playing a game of this scale. It really is amazing how much CD PROJEKT RED put into this and they easily made one of the best games I've ever played.
[b]The Witcher 3 is one of the greatest RPGs ever made. You heard it at lest 100 times. But I am here to tell you why. [/b]
Let's start with story. It's set in medieval fantasy word filled up with every creature from farytales you can think of and it's amazing. It's very exciting from start to end. It has some weaker points here and there, but It's still pretty solid. The story telling, cut scenes and voice acting are just perfect. This game has tons of side quests to offer. But it's not just simple 'Bring me something' or 'kill something'. Every quest has it's own story and different ways to complete it. Some of them are pretty funny to do too. Yes, you have lots of monster killing quests, but every time it's different type of monster, so you must use different type of tactics to kill it. The game world is HUGE. It's seperated into 2 bigger maps(Velen, Skelliege) and 3 smaller maps(White Orchard, Kaer Morhen and Castle at Wizyma). Every area has different coloring, music, nature, people and monsters. It's completely different worlds. Every world live it's own life. You can see day and night cycle, wildlife, villagers doing their daily routines, monsters hunting animals, weather changes and people yelling at you. It feels like you are in real world, not just in some randomly generated areas. Graphics are awesome even today. Everything has so much detail, sunsets are breathtaking and landscape is beautifully generated. The World has some bugs, but not any significant ones. RPG aspect of the game is great too. You have many skill trees to upgrade, lots of armours and swords to gain/craft/buy and tons of crafting materials. You can even collect herbs to make potions or bombs. You can drink these potions or use bombs in fight too. You can even buy seat, bags and blinkers for your horse.  Money si problem only at the start of the game, later, they are not a problem (unless you want to make every witcher gear armour in the game.). The biggest problem of the game is your horse Roach. She stucks at every tree and she can't go down hill. I know developers made fun of it, even at some quests, but it's still annoying. The Witcher 3 offers 3 mini games such as Gwent - very exciting card game with hours of fun, fist fighting and horse racing. You can join tournaments and win titules of champion and some valuable prizes. DLCs are not just regular dlcs. They're almots as big as standalone games. They have different, new and great story. Blood and Wine has It's own new world. If you want to beat the game without dlcs, but with every quest and area completed it will take you 150-175 hrs. With both dlcs, prepare to spend around 250 hrs in game.

[h1]Overall[/h1]
The Witcher 3 is truly best RPG made in past years, maybe the best RPG ever made. It has exciting story living world and It's nice ending of the Witcher series. DLCs are masterpieces. It has so much content in it, but price is better then every AAA titles out there. If you are fan of the series, or not, go and buy this game at GOTY edition, you definitely won't regret it.
(This review has now been moved to my original account, 
please view the review here: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/calaeyo/recommended/292030/]Updated Review[/url])

Its hard to try and summarise a game that has so much depth, because it truly deserves more then just a review for recognition. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt has got to be one of the greatest single player games I've ever played, and that is from somebody that is not accustomed to the previous two titles. 

With so many areas to talk about, I'll first mention about game dialogue. Considering an average novel is between 80,000 and 100,000 words, the script to Witcher 3 accumulates to a 450,000 word goliath. Unbelievable! It requires over 950 speaking roles, which reportedly took more than two and a half years to successfully accomplish. Whats slightly more incredible then those statistics, is that Witcher 3 makes you feel like you [u]don't[/u] want to skip any of it whatsoever, through an amalgamation of whit, thrill, mystery, passion and more. I've never known a game to deliver dialogue so well, but on top of that its you that gets the choice of how the story goes. Your in control! You can continue to show Geralt as the renowned warrior he is, or you can often show his softer side in certain situations. There is no right or wrong. Even towards the latter stages, Co-developer Marcin Iwinski announced that there are 36 possible endings for the game, mind = blown. 

The environment to Witcher 3 is also a great achievement in itself. To put it into perspective, the map is 20% larger than Skyrim. Its also 35 times larger than the map found in Witcher 2. A large map is a good feat on its own, but these facts give CD Projekt Red massive bragging rights! At first it felt like the environment was very much going to be the same throughout, and I was really wondering whether or not there would be massive differences later on. As it turns out there is so much more in the lands of Witcher 3 to explore, in which I was extremely keen to find for myself. 

You get to see a lot of the world through the storyline, but stepping away from that and doing side quests & contracts are where you can find yourself in extraordinary circumstances. I can't honestly tell you another game thats genuinely made me want to do [u]everything[/u]. Each side quest feels like a mini-storyline, you don't seem to get any that follow a tedious or repetitive nature. On one side of the spectrum you could be fighting the biggest and deadliest creatures that Velen and Skellige have to offer, then on the other side you'll be hunting treasure, balls deep in Nekker swamps.

You'll more then likely reach a few points in the game where you are overburdened with side quests, treasure hunts and contracts. It can sometimes lead to confusion, but the easiest way to clear your Journal is to go through them one by one. Obviously due to level restrictions, some of them cannot be completed until Geralt is stronger - which doesn't mean you can't try to do them, it just means that it will be incredibly difficult to do so. One moment that I will always remember is when I went to fight a Royal Griffin that was 12 levels higher then me. I would spend a long time evading damage and trying to deliver some form of pain, but its almost like the Griffin was laughing at me, all I seemed to do was shave feathers off its back, nothing more. Then in one foul swoop, I'd be dead. Repeat. Dead. Repeat. Dead. Shit. I'm one that embraces difficulty, playing on the hardest setting in this game is fantastic, yet this was a battle that I [u]had[/u] to swallow my pride and leave. Go away. Get stronger. Come back, and rip that fucking bird to pieces. This was great, not many times have I been in a situation where a game would allow me to fight a much higher level, you tend to get games match the enemies strength based on your current level. With this said, I actually much preferred Witcher 3's approach, it created some great and memorable fight scenes where I wouldn't necessarily assume victory. Certain areas are swamped with much higher creatures early on, so returning to them 50+ hours later provides a nice feeling of self accomplishment and power. 

Now I remember all those years ago, playing cards in a big Saloon in Red Dead Redemption. Poker, Blackjack, maybe a little bit of Five Finger Fillet or Liar's Dice. These were wonderful times. Now I have a new love, playing Gwent. Gwent is a collectable card game that simulates two armies meeting on the battlefield. "Invented by dwarves and perfected over centuries of tavern table play, Gwent is a game of initial simplicity and ultimate depth, something beloved by both road-weary travellers during long nights around the campfire and elegant nobles looking to liven up dragging dinner parties." I have no idea how much time I've spent playing Gwent in this game, all I can say is that 25 hours into this game I was Level 3. 3! Gwent immediately took my focus as I attempted to gain recognition throughout Velen. Its a continous side quest in the game, challenging notable opponents and entering tournaments, not only that but also every merchant is up for a game. Just when you think your building a great deck and come out of a tournament as the winner, a local fishmonger will always be ready to embarass you (early on anyway, it becomes a breeze later on in game). There is also a quest to collect them all, so enjoy your time hunting for all 150 cards spread through the factions of Nilfgaard, Northen Realms, Monsters & Scoia'tael. 

I've always enjoyed games that heavily involve fighting, particularly when the mechanisms are right. I have heard mixed  reviews about the mechanisms to Witcher 3 combat, some arguing that Geralt feels particularly stiff and robotic when under attack... absolute garbage. I think combat can be pretty tricky in Witcher 3 for those unfamiliar with the series, considering the many different mechanics in play at any one time. Blocking, parrying, signs, pivots, rolls, variant of sword, etc. Practice makes perfect, and it is different to other games so get used to it! Thats all I can say. Dismemberment is always a joy to behold, and Geralt doesn't hold back on his capability to carve through people, creatures and monsters like butter.

Could this game have anything to make it better? Yes & it does - Free DLC. Not just a few, but 16! 16 Free DLC packages to add even more into a well-packed game. CD Projekt Red have had the best launch I've seen of a game, in terms of its update structure and responsiveness to people's comments. From launch there was new DLC every week, patches to address issues and bugs retaining in-game. Free DLC includes new armor sets, the ability to visit a barber, new quests, contracts, animations, alternative looks, and not to forget the NEW GAME + mode. 

I put this review on hold numerous of times as it deserved to be reviewed once completed, it truly is a remarkable and well made game that will forever have the highest of impacts on me. Its groundbreaking in every sense of the word, and literally pisses all over certain companies that think its right to strip a new game of content then release it as paid DLC. Congratulations to CD Projekt Red for providing one of the most immersive & detailed games that I have ever seen, I look forward to the expansions "Hearts of Stone" & "Blood and Wine" to continue my witcher journey!
I really wanna write longer review for this awesome game that it is,
but my patience for writing in english is too much for me.

I can't praise this game AND CD Project Red enough for my friends, 
they are probably tired of it.

Many people say this but i'm gonna say it again bitches.
I wish i could go back in time and play it again like i did the first time. 
The game absorbs your SOUL and you just feel like the most badass monster hunter ever.
Deep dark fantasy and very adult game, play it "Death march" difficulty for the best experience,
except if you are casual with not that much of an experience.

If you are RPG/Open world/Fantasy fan, this is a must buy.

I don't think that this review will get lots of readers or likes, but it was fun to write, Thank you.

PS. Team Yennefer.

[UPDATE]

I didn't think i could manage to get to the top reviews for Witcher 3 and i just wanna thank you guys, it's a dream come true for a big Witcher fan.

And also, check my screenshots for Witcher 3!
[list]
    [*]Bought Witcher 2 for $4 dollar on a sale,Got hooked to the witcher world

    [*]So I read all 8 witcher books.

    [*]Then I spent $300 on a graphic card so I can play this game

    [*]Finishing the main game left emotional trauma because I felt so attached to the story. 

    [*]Then comes the DLC that made me feel I got my money worth.

You just witnessed journey of a addict, but tis a wild ride I would gladly wipe my memory and enjoy again. 

[/list]
I live in a third world country.
20-25$ is like a lot for most people here. So everyone basically plays cracked and pirated games.
So do I most of the time.
But, god bless this game right here. I felt so mesmerized and fell soooo I love with this game that I decided do support the developers by actually buying this game. Saved up my pocket money for 3 months to end up buying this!

10/10!
10/10

I'll be completely honest with the review, when I first got the game I pirated it , 
After finishing my first playthrough I  just had to buy the game, it truly deserves the 60$.

The story is so well written it got me so attached to the characters , that by the time that I finished it  I felt kinda sad that the journey was over and I  left the game aside for 3 months.

I decided to return, now that the game has released 2 big dlcs , had played through the game twice doing normal playthrough and "new game plus" , it was fun even for the 3rd time.

The enviroment , the colors, the soundtrack everything about the game is perfect.

The 2 Main dlcs (Heart Of Stone , Blood And Wine):

Heart Of Stone was great dlc that added content to some places that were considered as "abandoned" in the map, which was really nice.

Now Blood And Wine, it adds a whole new location in the game , with unique storyline , Npcs , new enemies , Skills and alot more, and the ending was really a great way to finish a great series.

I usually don't spend time on writing reviews, probably just wasted 5 minutes I won't get back , but I felt like this game deserves those 5 minutes . Also sorry if there were some grammer mistakes .
Pros:
- Fabulous graphics
- Very big open world to explore
- Amazing storytelling
- Very good voice acting
- Likeable characters
- Detailed and immersive cutscenes
- A lot of choices to make
- Enjoyable combat
- Many high quality optional side quests
- DLC's actually contain a lot of extra content
- Gwent

Cons:
- The game ends
10/10
And thats not a fanboy or exaggerated rating
Never played the preceding 2 games.
I was simply looking for an immersive open world game.
Well gents,
Immersive is one huge understatement.
I'll make this short.
I'm highly satisfied with my life. My golden retriever and choco lab give me joy. My wife and kids give me joy. My self-employed status gives me joy.
But this game...
It gave me depression when I finished it.
Not because the game is depressing. But because I lived in its world and I got attached to it. How the game simulates the main characters and your interaction with them, makes this game feel so damn alive. Parting with the world after finishing the game, fucked with my heart and my mind, really.
I whole heartedly recommend this game.
I strongly recommend taking anti-depressants when you reach the main quest: Final Preparations. Keep taking them meds for a month unless you want to orphan your family.

CD Projekt Red, I would gladly ransom Tim Cook and use the money to fund your next witcher games.

UPDATE:

I finally stopped taking tricyclic antidepressants when I discovered the "Multi-companion Mod" from the nexusmods website. Don't look it up until you've finished the game. Just make sure to remember the mod and that I mentioned it (so you can send me free games as a sign of gratefulness). You'll thank me later for saving your life and for saving you money that you otherwise would have spent on medication treatment and therapy. My dogs are happy for me.

UPDATE: 12/17/2017
After reading the novels following my playthrough, I realized that the true spectacular art in CD Projekt Red’s The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, is how the game is truly built around the core story which was based on Andrezej Sapkowski’s novels. The personalites and characters with every detail from the of world of Geralt of Rivia, was masterfully captured and used as the mold for this masterpiece of a game. Every why and every question you might have pertaining to the story will be answered by reading the novels. The motives and quirks of Geralt and the world he’s from has been transfigured to a game fitting of Sapkowski’s brilliance. This game is undeniably a work of art. Game of the Year 2015, well deserved.

UPDATE: Went back a year later and played it differently. I no longer rushed moving from point A to point B. This time I took in the scenery and environment as much as I could. Gorgeous.
[i]When I'm 80 years old and sitting in my rocking chair, I'll be playing The Witcher 3. And my family will say to me, 'After all this time?' And I will say, 'Always.'[/i]

This game deserves every last bit of praise it has gotten. It has one or two flaws (most of which will be resolved with the Add-Ons), but you'll have to be really, really picky to find them, if you'll even notice.

Only problem with this game is that it still finishes [i]me[/i] even upon finishing the game for the third time and that I have absolute no idea what to play next -- for whatever it will be, I will be sorely disappointed.
I don't know if I can adequately explain why this game is as amazing as I think it is.... but I'll try.

[U][B]The Good[/B][/U]

[B]The writing[/B]
Hands down, this game has some of the best writing I've ever experience in an RPG. The main quest feels very personal, and you actually want to progress in order to find out what happens next. The characters are all interesting and also incredibly well-written. 

[B]The quests[/B]
Again, this game has the best side quests out of all the RPGs I've played. And that's saying a lot. Every quest seems to have at least some back story. There's typically at least a few forms of interaction other than just killing something and then returning to the quest giver. The decisions you make are never black and white, and usually involve some form of consequences. And FINALLY, you actually get to feel like a real witcher\monster hunter by taking on some really fun witcher contracts. 

[B]The world[/B]
Velen and Skellige can both rival some of the largest open worlds out there in terms of size, and yet the level of detail and polish remains consistent throughout. Exploration is very rewarding. There's loot to be found everywhere, and little quests can be unlocked along the way to help you find even more treasure. 

Novigrad is a HUGE city, and you just walk inside without a hint of a loading screen. It actually feels like a living, breathing world. NPCs have daytime\nighttime routines, and will seek shelter if it starts to rain. Little things like that go along way to bring you into a world.

[B]Graphics and art design[/B]
How can I put this? All things considered, The Witcher 3 is probably the most beautiful game I've ever played. You must experience this game in motion, but [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/jim2point0/sets/72157653074223832]feel free to look through my screenshots if you need convincing.[/url] One thing that can't be seen in screenshots is the way everything moves and feels alive. And while the wind effect might seem overdone, it really helps to sell the atmosphere. 

The Witcher 3 can be rough around the edges and other games are definitely doing some more impressive things technically, but the overall Witcher 3 experience is definitely greater than the sum of its parts. 

[B]The combat[/B]
This grew on me. At first I didn't like it. I didn't think signs were strong enough, and I was constantly getting my butt kicked. But then I learned how to dodge and counter properly. I learned how to use signs to my advantage, I learned how to stick and move, and start treating each encounter like a puzzle. Eventually I was punching WAY above my weight, taking on level 20 witcher contracts with a level 14 character. Now I love the combat and I'm always looking forward to doing the next Witcher contract.

[U][B]The Bad[/B][/U]

[B]Controls[/B]
Quite possibly my biggest gripe with the game. Controls just feel clunky at best. I play with a mouse and keyboard, so maybe that is part of the reason... but movement in this game feels sluggish and unresponsive. Sometimes I'll try to move Geralt a little bit and he won't budge, and at other times he'll move too far and run off a cliff. Just turning around can feel like a chore as Geralt has a rather large turning radius. Even worse are the horse controls, which kinda feels like driving around a very large SUV. Constantly getting stuck on geometry and trying to maneuver around it is an ongoing, frustrating chore.

[B]Balance[/B]
Even on the largest difficulty, it doesn't take long for this game to become a cake walk. IF you enjoy the sidequests like I do, you'll likely spend a lot of time completing them instead of doing the main quest. The main quest is GOOD, but some of the game's best content can be found in the sidequests. And after 20 hours of questing, you'll probably find that the next step in the campaign is 5 levels below you and therefore not challenging in the slightest. There were several instances where I'd go up against an enemy that is supposed to be tough and intimidating... but I kill it in less than 12 seconds.

Loot progression is also a joke if you do any kind of crafting. The witcher gear is probably better than anything the game will give you from monsters or chests. During your travels, you'll come across countless relic quality swords. And they may even have more damage than your current green sword. But witcher gear is highly specialized and usually compliment specific builds. Using a higher damage sword might actually gimp you if you lose a massive bonus to sign intensity, or adrenaline point gain. 

[B]Other stuff...[/B]
There's still so much I could go into. Replay value is probably lower since you only have 1 character to play as, but the game makes up for that with a much more personal and involved story. Gwent is probably a very fun card game, but I still haven't played a single game due to not wanting to dump a ton of time into it. Some day I will. Witcher sense is fun at first, but after a while it will feel like a chore. Having to hold down the button combined with the ridiculous screen effects really hampers my enjoyment of this commonly used mechanic. And you never feel like you're solving an investigation using witcher sense. Just looking for red stuff on the ground and following on screen prompts while Geralt figures everything out for you. 

[U][B]Conclusion[/B][/U]
I can not possibly cover everything there is to cover about this massive game. But I can say that the good FAR outweighs the bad, and that this is is my favorite open world RPG of all time. I know that The Witcher series isn't for everyone, but I think you owe it to yourself to at least give it a try. 

And again, if you need convincing that this game is drop-dead gorgeous, have a look through my screenshots :)

[b]∞/10[/b]
[h1]Game Of The Eternity[/h1]
There are games that you play, and then there are games that you live in.

I've been playing this game for more than 100 hours and I'm nowhere near completion. I don't think I'm even 2/3rds through, honestly. And that's not due to filler either: while TW3 has plenty points of interest and repeating activities, the amount of content is downright [i]oppressive[/i].

I honestly feel like I've spent several years of my life in the world of TW3, like it's a part of me. It's just that big, that genre-defining.

Is it perfect? Of course not. The fights and levelling systems are rather shallow, some designs are silly and tasteless (Yennefer always looks like she just walked out of an early 00s cheap TV series set), and loot overload becomes a slog. On the other hand, the dialogue is extremely charismatic if not taken too seriously, many stories are fun, the optimization is very impressive, and the locations are diverse and thought-through.

But all that doesn't even matter. This game could have had way more downsides than it has and still receive a thumbs up from me. It's just that big, genre-defining, and important. It has become a part of my life, a place I've lived in for a while.

And you don't downvote a part of your life simply because it has questionable levelling.
Genre - Open Worlded Fantasy RPG

I have played through the Witcher 1 and 2 until the end of both. Recently I read all the English translated books by Andrzej Sapkowski (a hero and they are highly recommended).

I have already ploughed 80+ hours into this game by doing many exploration, sub and main quests. I am trying to have breaks so I will finish it eventually (unlike Skyrim, where I was Skyrim'd out).

The monsters, characters and environments stay true to the Witcher world. You can tell the people who made this game really care about this game and its environment. They are providing free DLC, but you can buy a season pass if you want even more Witcher goodness.

The fighting is fluid and there are horse races, crafting and collectible card games to add even more variety to a great well thought out game. Shame there are no sex cards this time though ;-)

The graphics look great even on the lowest settings and each quest feels like a proper adventure, not just fetch some feathers or kill ten wolves because they look scary. You actually feel like you are making a difference to the world around you, liberating towns and developing relationships.

This is one of the best games I have played. I won't say game of the year just yet, but it is clearly going to be in the top five!
I do not write reviews often and I know this is waaaay behind the curve.  However, in my 25 years of gaming, I am left with my jaw agape.  This game is a masterpiece of art and storytelling.  I played through all three Witcher games and can say it was completely worth the experience.  Being a father of two, with a full time and part time job, I rarely get time to enjoy my favorite past time, gaming.  I have become pickier with my gaming as my time is much rarer.  I do not have time for “filler” games.  I consider games a form of art and the Witcher 3 exceeded all my expectations.  My complaints were minor, and a mere blip compared to the joy this game brought me.
If you enjoy rich storytelling, superb voice acting, fun combat, and a deep RPG experience…you need this game.  My hat is off to CD Projekt Red and they have my heartfelt thanks for such a wonderfully fun and immersive experience. 

One of those games where you want to forget the entire thing so you can go through it again. 

I believe that is the highest praise I can give to any form of entertainment.
This video game is a true masterpiece.

The Witcher 3 offers the best storyline I've ever seen. You can decide anything, both minor and major things. All characters in game have their own story which is really awesome.              Velen is a land that suffered war and gives you that real authentic touch of how medieval land looks like just like Novigrad which is just how one middle-age city looked like.                     Graphics are beautiful and honestly I haven't seen a RPG like it.  After that you have epic side quests with amazing lore and seriously huge map to explore. By huge I mean the biggest map for 1 higly complexed video game in history.
 
Then, when I entered the Skellige its like I entered another world.The authentic Irish accent made it look like whole another universe which this game truly is. During game you have several romance options and you choose a girl which you will end up with which is something seirously amazing for a video game. Not to mention all those sex scenes.             
To complete main storyline alone it takes around 50 hours while ending depends on you and your choices troughout whole game. 

The soundtracks in this game are literally THE BEST. They are mostly made of polish folk music but there are also some Serbian such as "Oj Lazare" which are some of the best slavic musics. The only con in this game was that in free roam I didn't have the option to talk to the main characters but that was fixed in latest expansion which I really appreciate CDPR for, as I and many other customers requested it.                        

I won't be describing DLC's as this review should be dedicated to the base game.                                     I really recommend this game to everyone, from RPG fans to those who never played a RPG game before. 

You WILL enjoy this game and you must play it!

It was worth every cent, 10/10.
-Great story
-Great graphics
-Great gameplay
-great gwent
-great lore
-great soundtrack
-no microtransactions
-no lootboxes

This is the magnum opas rpg

10/10 would "what now you piece of filth?" again
Set a standard that every game and developer hasn't been met yet. Makes it kinda sad the more you think about it, like this game has essentially ruined gaming.
195 hours later, my epic journey with Geralt of Rivia comes to a close. Anything I say now would just be retreading over what everyone else has said, but regardless; this was one of the finest gaming experiences of my life. The world was meticulously crafted, the story was engaging, the characters were believable, the struggles and victories powerful, combat was enjoyable and varied.. this was magnificent. Not a perfect game, but very close to it, performance left a lot to be desired and the bug list was shocking to be perfectly honest.. exceeded - if not matched - only by the likes of Obsidian and Bethesda, and that simply should not happen in this day and age. The UI was merely passable in some instances and downright terrible in others and, sadly, the levelled-loot was made utterly worthless due to the expansive crafting system in the game. You craft, and use for the majority of the game, far better gear than you can find or buy -- and that, too, is a shame.

Still, I won't soon forget this game and indeed I fear now that the bar has been raised to such a level that it will negatively impact my enjoyment of other so-called "open world RPGs" to come. A bitter sweet realisation, I guess, though there's nothing to do about it now except wait and hope for games to match the quality set forth by The Witcher 3. Onward to Cyberpunk, CDPR, you've got your work cut out for you.. that's for damned sure.

10/10, would snowball fight with Ciri again.
Score: 10/10
Time to 100%: 150 hours

Easily, unequivocally, absolutely, undoubtedly, undeniably, one of my favourite games ever, ever, ever - did I mention ever - ever! Here are just some of the many reasons as to why this game is so great:

PROS:

[b]The Leading Man[/b] - Something has to be said about our main protagonist - he's an absolute badass reminiscent to that of Solid Snake. From his scar-riddled body to his gruff and gravelly voice every ounce of him oozes cool. I want to be him. Women want him. On initial impressions you might think he will turn out to be a monotone bore, void of personality but this also couldn't be further from the truth. Geralt can always manage to deliver great lines of dialogue from witty quips to interesting introspectives. In truth he is a great leading man.

[b]Game Within A Game[/b] - While some games like to add some extra little minigames to their game that can prove to be entertaining for a couple of minutes at best Witcher 3 went the extra mile and added Gwent - a fully fleshed out card game that adds dozens and dozens of hours of extra gameplay. This card game itself is entirely optional within the game, but whole sidequests go unfulfilled should you choose to ignore it - which you really shouldn't - because it's a lot of fun. Northern Realms is best deck!

[b]The Writing[/b] - There's always a special place in my heart for games that manage to give a choice of not black and white options - but the all too common and ever uncertain options of grey. You know, the choices that don't have a clear cut good answer or bad answer. The choices which, all to often is going to hurt SOMEONE. Witcher 3 has plenty of these and even goes the extra mile of luring you into a "good" choice only for outcomes to go horribly wrong. It makes me question my choice, makes me feel bad, makes me reload previous saves, makes me love it all the more.

[b]A Good Looker[/b] - Straight up this game is GEORGEOUS! There have been plenty of times where I've just stopped in a beautiful glade or mountainpass and just thought "Wow" as I take it all in. Even the cutscenes in the game can be so pretty, the characters even have their intricate little flaws and detals like tiny marks, bumps and cuts on their skin and faces. I can only appreciate the sheer amount of work that went into making a game of this beauty. 

[b]The Celtic Influence[/b] - Ok this one, well I'm Irish so I can already appreciate the heck out of it. It's blatent celtic cultural influence is just a joy to see and makes me think of a simpler time. Props to the Witcher 3 staff hiring Scottish & Northern Irish voice actors for basically the entire populous of Ard Skellige. 

I could also mention other things like how the game does a great job of handling lore of fantasy - delving into a whole host of mytical creatures or how the fighting mechanics of Witcher are a technical joy, having to read up on creatures weaknesses and using useful concoctions in the heat of battle are a must for higher difficulties, but I won't say anymore I can't praise this game enough - PLAY IT.

CONS: 

Haha, no.
350 hours, from the beginning of last year till now, I only played this one game. After achieving level 100, done all the missions, quests, collecting all the qwent cards, I have to go back and face the real world.



And the real world is boring.
[b]For me this is the best Single Player game, I've ever played. [/b]

[b]Storyline - 10/10 [/b]
Story is presented in a very nice form. In most of the dialogue you can choose what to say. We have many ways to pass the mission. We can do it quietly or killing everyone. Each mission is interesting and different than earlier. The story is for 30h game without sidequests. We also have mini games like cards (Gwent).

[b]Gameplay - 9/10 [/b]
Beautiful world giving many opportunities for the player. We can explore caves, forests, mountains, helping peoples and doing much more things. The map is 30 times bigger than in the previous part. Crafting and Alchemy are more important, we also can upgrade swords, armors and signs. These sandbox gives many, many opportunities. Fight feeling is pleasant. Sometimes we are blocking on a small obstacle but in comparison to other games it is not very annoying.

[b]Characters - 10/10 [/b]
Each character has its own charm. Characters are well matched to the storyline and to the environment. We can decide who will be our enemy and who is our friend. We also can choose the path of the main character. Character (mainly Geralt's) and monsters doing really great feeling, details are amazing.

[b]Graphics - 10/10 [/b]
Graphics in this game is amazing. Even the smallest details are well refined, for example when we move the grass moves with us. Graphics capabilities used in 100%. The movement of water clouds are very well refined, falling leaves, changing weather make a huge impression.

[b]Sounds - 10/10 [/b]
Music and ambient sounds in this game is great fits. We can listen medieval music which is selected for each moment of the game. Animals noises are natural. The monsters sounds are really threatening. Character voices are well selected and fit into personalities.

[b]Overall - 10/10 [/b]
If you are thinking about purchase this game, if you like open world and action RPG games, I would recommend these game for you, and I guarantee a lot of fun comes from that game. These game is masterpiece.
I try only to write reviews if I've got something to add about a game that I haven't seen many other reviewers already noting. I'll make an exception with Witcher 3. This game is just as good as every media outlet and amateur reviewer says it is. It might actually be, all things considered, the best game I've ever played. All of the hype you've heard is real. If that's all that matters to you, pick the game up right now. Read on for a bit more detail.

This game creates an experience that's far more than the sum of its parts. The excellent visuals and music, the lovely sound design, and the painstakingly well-crafted environments, NPCs, and quest and dialogue writing all combine to give this game a lived-in, realistic feel that very few games have been able to exhibit. Every corner of the world feels real. There's so much to experience across the several maps that you can simply wander from place to place for hours upon end, taking in all that there to experience. None of this is procedurally generated, either. It's all hand-crafted, and for those willing to look, there are some incredible things to find.

Early in the game, the player character Geralt meets a gungho historian off to chronicle the war. Geralt tells him not to go, that the warzone is a chaotic, anarchic wasteland and he'll be killed simply for the quality of his boots. The historian laughs it off, and offers to play a Gwent cardgame with Geralt. If Geralt wins, he can win a unique card from this NPC. Later in the game Geralt and Vesimir find themselves underneath a tree full of hanged civilians. Upon searching the foot of the tree, Geralt can find a half-finished history book, and the Gwent card the historian was carrying if it wasn't won from him earlier. The entire game is littered with moments like these; very subtle, missable details that only a minority of players will experience, yet CDPR has worked hard to place in the game anyway because they truly care about the depth of their world. I've played it through to completion several times and each time I find something new.

The quality of writing is so good that it will propel you to finish the game regardless of whether or not you like the combat. The characters are so likeable that you'll grow attached to them before too long, and the quality dialogue and voice acting makes the plot points hit that much harder. The unique thing about this game is not so much the quality of its writing, as there are quite a few games with solid writing, but the depth to which this quality of writing goes. From the main questline to the most minor sidequest, you can always expect to be pleasantly surprised. I was hooked by the very first monster hunting sidequest in White Orchard when you discover just [i]why[/i] this Noonwraith is roaming around the well in this small village. Each NPC seems to have a lovingly crafted backstory of their own, and even the most minor fetch quest has its own wrinkle to make it interesting. The high quality of these quests is even more impactful in a world of Mass Effect Andromeda's with their disposable, MMO inspired, procedurally generated fetch-quests. They don't make them like this anymore. This is a game in which the most minor sidequest you take on will take you nearly an hour, and it will make you stop and think about a dilemma, or a question it poses, through its quest writing. It's amazing just how much quality content the writing team put into this game. Nothing is disposable, everything in the game serves to garner an emotional reaction or ask an important question. It's packed to the brim with quality content to experience.

The most criticzed aspect of this game is the combat, which I actually find to be quite enjoyable. I recently finished my first Death March playthrough and I found the challenge to be quite satisfying. I very rarely felt cheated, never had to cheese the game to get past a particularly difficult section. The difficulty was very well balanced and I felt a strong sense of accomplishment upon completion. The abilities scale very well, going from utility in the beginning to being overpowered within the game world if you focus solely on improving one aspect. Aard, my favorite ability, becomes an absolute world-wrecker if you continue to improve it, allowing you to force blast a small city of enemies at its highest levels. All other abilities are equally useful, and they allow you to build Geralt in whichever way you choose without feeling like you're missing out on anything. Very few RPGs are as balanced as this one is. The combat itself is enjoyable as well, requiring quick dodges and counters the way you would expect a witcher to fight. Each monster type is unique and requires its own strategies, allowing you to fall back into similar patterns whenever you face one type, but there are enough different types of monsters that you'll never face one type for long enough to get bored. To me, the humans were always the most challenging.

When it first released there was some talk of graphics downgrades, bugs, and obtuse UI. However CDPR have completely eliminated all of these issues with the most extensive round of post-release patching I've ever seen for a game. Every major bug I remember encountering has been eliminated from the game, it looks phenomenal and runs very well, and the UI flows like a dream whether you're using mouse and keyboard or a controller. In addition to this they added a ton of free DLC, so make sure you've got all that stuff set to download after you purchase the game.

To top all of this off, this game has the best DLC offerings I've ever seen in a video game, period. Better than Minerva's Den, better than Lair of the Shadow Broker. The writing in Hearts of Stone is the best I've ever seen in a DLC, and is the high point of the entire Witcher series in my opinion. And the sheer amount of content added in Blood and Wine is mind-boggling. If you buy Witcher 3, buy the Game of the Year edition without any second thoughts.

This is a game you'll put hundreds of hours into without regret. You'll be missing the characters long after you've finished it. Any time you hear a music track from the game on YouTube you'll immediately become nostalgic for the game. Witcher 3 is truly a towering achievement in every sense of the term, it's one of the very few games in which I can't find anything to criticze. It's an absolute masterpiece, and no matter what types of games you enjoy, you should buy it and give it a shot. It might actually be [i]better[/i] than everyone says.
[h1]this game's been out for about 4 years now, there's 170k total reviews, and only around 4k of those are negative. if that's not a reason to say this game's amazing, i dont know what is.[/h1]

the graphics are [b]stunning[/b], especially if you have enhancement mods.

the gameplay is amazing all around.

the devs are really supportive of the fanbase & community.

combat is 10/10

story is one of the best out there, [h1]i'd even put it next to metal gear on a ranking list.[/h1] it's that good (and i havent even played through a quarter of it as of me writing this review, im too busy having fun!)

[h1]infinitely replayable.[/h1]

soundtrack is [b]god-tier[/b], in most games you'd get burnt out on the repeating songs, but TW3 changes this making you listen more the more you hear it.

voice acting is amazing, it puts you into a trance.

the environment is unparalleled.

the list goes on & on.
even if you don't like games similiar to this, read the line below. im not usually a fan of games like the witcher, but this... hit me a different way.
[b]buy this game, play it through, then buy it again & repeat the cycle

also the dlcs only have like 40 negative reviews.[/b]
The amount of content you get for your money is unbelievable. Every sidequest is interesting, something I have never seen in my entire gamerlife.

10/10
For a very long time I was thinking about writing a review on The Witcher 3 : Wild hunt...
I was always asking myself ; Am I good enough to write a review that this game truly deserves? So I never actually started to write the review.
But today I said fuck it , lets get started... And this my review so here we go : 
The Witcher 3 : Wild Hunt continues the story of the legendary witcher Geralt of Rivia , The white wolf , this time in search of cirilla, the witcheress who is the daughter of emperor Emhyr var Emreis...
The ability to travel through time and space makes Ciri a dangerous weapon with the potential to destroy the whole world.
Geralt is informed by Yennefer of Vengerberg (Geralt's lover and a powerful sorceress) that Ciri is being chased by The Wild Hunt, a group of wraithes from another dimension, for not so good intentions.
So Geralt goes on a mission to find Ciri before The Wild Hunt does... A mission in which he will face a lot of obstacles, new faces and old friends...
The story starts off pretty good and continues to be great and interesting the whole 40+ hours of the main story.
Characters are very well worked on and you can't help but love 'em.
CDPR dedicated 2.5 years to voice recording so I don't need to say how great everything is audio wise, dialogues are amazing and the music is just incredible, sometimes you just want to waste time mid-combat just to listen to the epic music while it lasts.
Speaking of combat, the gameplay is nearly flawless, very smooth and pretty balanced, you have to actually use some strategy and put in some thought in combat instead of spamming light/heavy attack buttons.
The level design is good and pretty diverse, side quests in the game are by far some of the best in video game history, some side quests in this game especially the witcher contracts have stories that are superior to some of the "AAA" 60$ games out there...
Everytime I play this masterpiece I wonder how a game developer can make so many different side quests at such a high quality?
Now to the graphics; The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is one of the best looking games of all time, it provides some of the best views you can possibly find in a video game, therefore it's a paradise for screenshot enthusiasts.
If all that wasn't enough already, CDPR released 16 (yes 16) FREE DLCs and 2 expansion packs the are as good as the main game (if not better) for a very fair price.
_
All in all I consider The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt not only the best RPG game of all time but also the greatest game ever released and it'll probably keep the crown for a while.
Before playing this game I had never played an RPG in my life, I played mostly fps and sports games on consoles. I tried this out on PS4 and it quickly became my favorite game of all time. Loved it so much I really wanted to experience it in 60 fps and with amazing graphics so I got into the PC master race and am now in my second playthrough.
This game felt sooo boring in the first 2-3 hours of my gameplay so i uninstalled it and i decided to never touch it for more than a year, but one day i decided to install it again and keep telling my self to stay positive hoping that one day i'll like this game (at least like the others did). so after playing some more hours i finally realized why this game is so far the best game ever made and received a crazy amount of positive reviews. to all of you who think this game is bad on your first couple of hours of gameplay, give this game a chance and play some more like i did. this game is a masterpiece. 10/10

This game is so spot on in so many areas that it's hard to review. Imagine a really, really good movie, with action and suspense and wry comedy and adult themes. Now imagine that it has its own world, its own lore, and you're actually playing a character in it, becoming doubly invested in the characters' stories. I know that this is the promise of so many other games, but The Witcher 3 actually delivers like no other game. 

The difficulty is super scalable so that you get just as much tension as you want, making it excellent even for "casuals." I have spent nearly 200 hours on just one playthrough, without a break in which I played something else. I've been gaming since the days of the Tandy 1000, and I have never put this kind of time into a game. And I'm looking forward to delving into the DLC. 

If there was a game that deserved, in content, quality, enjoyability, and sheer production quality, to be far higher than the $59.99 AAA mark, this would be it. And it's $39.99 right now. You need to play this game, now, while everything is still the BEST that exists. Don't let this one be one of those that you put off for ten years, only to "meh" at it when it's cheap. If you buy one AAA game in 2016 and 2017 combined, it should be this one.
I couldn't believe how "empty" I felt after finishing this game. I got that feeling you get after you finish a REAAALLLY good Netflix series... You just don't know what to do in your life anymore. But seriously, I loved everyone minute of this game, and really tried to stretch it into the most hours. The main story is awesome, I loved messing around with Ciri and my Witcher buddies. I felt like every decision was important, and the game does a really good job of that. The consequences for decisions may be immediate, or will present themselves over time, whether they be good or bad. I love this game, and eagerly await the lengthy expansions. BUY THE WITCHER 3 NOW.
I'm the kind of person who doesn't like to hand out superlatives like "best". Normally whenever you try to unpack "best", it's normally hard to quantify, or at worst, empty rhetoric.

That's why I was so surprised with myself. Around ten hours into The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, a question popped into my head. "Is this the best game I've ever played?" I tried to dismiss it, re-frame it into something more subjective, but the question wouldn't go away. So I decided, "what the hell, I'll finish the game and ask myself that question again."

Now that I've finished the story, well... I think it is. From start to finish, Witcher 3 stands a full head and shoulders above every RPG I've played in almost every metric that matters to me. It has the most fully realized open world I've ever experienced. Its story and characters are deep and compelling. The game is immersive in ways I still can hardly believe. Its visuals are breathtaking, the music is fantastic. The amount of content--meaningful content, not flavorless side quests--is staggering.

[b]The World[/b]
The current trend in open-world games seems to be using procedural generation to offer playable areas that are more than anyone could successfully explore in a lifetime. But I'm sure you've played a few games that promise this and deliver a world that's wide as the ocean and shallow as a puddle. Witcher 3 is the opposite of this. Every inch of Velen, Novigrad, and Skellige that you encounter is lovingly crafted. This is one of the only games I've played besides Elder Scrolls games where you can literally set off in a random direction and find self-sustaining adventure.
tl;dr: better game than no man's sky/10

[b]Narrative/Characters[/b]
The main story is fantastic. The world of the Witcher is noticeably cynical, and the game uses this to its advantage. The story's conflict hinges around very adult fears and uses very adult themes to drive these points home. You spend the vast majority of the game looking for Ciri, Geralt's adopted daughter. She's not held in some magic crystal, trapped but otherwise safe--you don't know what's happened to her, all you can do is search and hope for the best.
The characters you meet, both supporting characters and general NPCs, are excellent. They're well-written, well-voiced, and well-animated, and it's a joy listening to them and hearing more about their stories.
The story is branching, but the amazing part is that I can't tell you by how much. Normally, it's readily apparent in games with choices where exactly the story branches, but this game does an excellent job at hiding the seams. The consequences of your decisions aren't readily apparent until sometimes hours of playtime after you make them.
tl;dr: feels/10

[b]Immersion[/b]
I read reviews before buying this, and people kept saying the game was "immersive".
I didn't believe that at first, but after playing the game, I can confirm that it's the strongest point of the game. You really do feel like Geralt of Rivia, an itinerant monster slayer who often gets wrapped up in things larger than the Path he walks. You feel like you have his powers--superhuman senses, reflexes, and an encyclopedic knowledge of supernatural monsters that the commonfolk only know in myths.
The game is huge on player agency, allowing you to use what you know to solve problems as best you can. It's hard not to feel immersed when you're using your Witcher Senses to identify distant threats by sound.
[i][b]Immersive Narrative[/b][/i]
After you've played a lot of games that allow you to make decisions, you start recognizing tropes. "If you unlock a special dialogue option, take it--nothing bad will happen." "If someone tells you they're misunderstood, they normally are." Very early in the game, I let rules like this influence my decision, and the game slapped my wrist for it. I blinked, but I didn't listen and tried again on a more major plot point. The game punched me in the dick. After that, I stopped trusting people at face value. I became willing to refuse people who I thought were lying to me. I started making decisions as Geralt of Rivia, instead of someone playing a video game. I almost always play RPGs as Neutral Good, doing what I think is right and helping everyone I possibly can whether they deserve it or not. The fact that a game could make me change this is absolutely massive.
tl;dr: i'm a witchman/10

[b]Content[/b]
I already talked about how much there is to do in the world, but it deserves a special mention that this game is priced at $50. My total runtime for completion of the main story quest and maybe 60-70% of sidequests and exploration was around 120 hours. None of that time was grinding for money, experience, anything of the sort--just pure adventure. I've played AAA games for $60 that didn't have 1/4th the content this one does. Not to mention, the myriad of free DLC the game comes with, and the absolutely massive expansion packs that I've, at the time of this writing, just barely dipped my toes in. It really boggles the mind and makes you wonder what some of these other video game companies even think they're doing. After playing this game, if it was priced at $90 or even $100, I'd still say it was worth it. And I didn't even mention Gwent.
tl;dr: i owe CD Projekt Red money/10

[b]Audio/Visual[/b]
The game is beautiful and runs exceptionally. I don't normally focus on graphics because it's more important to me that a game have a defined visual style, but Witcher 3 has one and it's beautiful. The music is excellent as well, carrying the desperation of life in Velen, the somber song of Skellige, and the carefree life (for some) of Novigrad. 

[b]Combat[/b]
This is the only part of the game that doesn't sparkle as brightly. It almost doesn't feel fair to say that, as combat in this game is very good, it just didn't dazzle me like the rest. I began to outlevel the foes I'd encounter while exploring, which trivialized combat. The game has a very good crafting and skill system to bolster your combat, but when the combat itself didn't stress me, I didn't feel much of a need to come up with clever solutions to problems. I've upped the difficulty for my playthrough of the expansions, so if I need to adjust this section later, I will.

All in all, this game is a masterwork. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes RPGs even a little bit. And for the foreseeable future, if anyone asks me what the best game I've ever played is, I will say the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.
There are only two bad things with this game
1-The feeling of emptiness you will receive after finishing this game.
2-The fact that no other game you will play in the future will be as good as this. Hell even DLCs are the best thing there is.

An absolute masterpiece that everyone must play. Thank you CDPR

Now, onto my first new game+ campaign, because apparently I can not enjoy other games anymore
NO SPOILERS

Pros:

+Developer actually gives a f*ck about making a good game. 
+Developer genuially cares about the fans.
+NO MICROTRANSACTIONS OR LOOTBOXES
+Excellent indepth story.
+Intresting Characters.
+Detailed open world. (seperated by loading zones)
+Unique and intresting characters.
+Fun and challenging combat system.
+Free Amazing soundtrack.
+Beatiful graphics.
+Good optimization. (GTX 1050ti, i7 2600, 8gb of Ram, All Settings Set to Ultra, Fps 45-60)
+Very good DLC that is arguably better than the main game.
+Couple of  dozen of free DLC.
+RPG elements.
+Sidequests are unique and intresting.


Cons:

-(Possibly) Makes you feel every game you played before this is sh*t.
-(Mixed) Too much damn content.
-Underwater controls are meh. (only applys to keyboards)
-Horse tends to get stuck on the smallest things.
-AI is super dumb if you play on easy. (don't play on easy)
-You can cheese some enmies if your outside their range with your crossbow.

Personal Thoughts:

I mean where do I even begin, I am genuinely surprised about the amount of quality and love was put into this game. The story is beatifully crafted and intresting to play. The combat is fun and has the right amount of challenge, along with awsome spells you use. Plus the combinations of making potions and armors/swords makes this a solid combat system with variety. What really got me about this game is the choices you have to make. The choices I made really made me think if the choice I chose was really the right choice. All the choices in this game are morally grey, just like real life. This reminded of when I played Mass Effect for the first time, but with so much more depth and detail. The soundtrack is excellent and really gets you involved in the game. Overall this is just a good damn game that deserves your 60$. The developers, CD Project Red actually care about the fans and making a fantastic game. So a round of applause to the developers for caring about us the fans instead of screwing us over. Overall I fully recommend this game if your are a RPG lover and want a game with quality and love put into it.

Final Score: 10/10
After reading every book and playing all three games + dlc I can confidently say that The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt isn't a good game.

It's a fucking masterpiece in not just gaming, but as a crowning symbol of human achievement in the arts of storytelling.

EDIT: Nominated for some awards in the Steam 2018 Awards since I haven't had the time to really play games this year but I will never forget the experience I had with this game
"Write a review for The Witcher® 3: Wild Hunt"? Do you write a review for the air you breathe? For the stars in the sky? For seeing an old friend after 10 years? For a lunch in the park on a sunday afternoon with the person you love? For fulfilling all your heart's desires? For passing away at peace at an old age surrounded with people who love you? 
We don't need a review for that. It speaks for itself.
Got a main quest.
On my way to do main quest.
"What is that question mark on the map?
gonna check that out"
"Oh , contracts!"

"Let's go to Skellige!"
I've been gaming for well over 30 years.
I've been PC gaming since before Windows even existed.
I've long been an avid fan of story-driven RPG's, and there are not many out there I've not played. That being said, you can take my review with however large a grain of salt you may wish. 

To say the game is vast belies the true scope. The designers wisely guide you from quest to quest in a flowing, natural way, almost always part of the story. Note that I said "guide". There is rarely any pressure or situations that lockstep you into a given path. You are free to make choices that let you go as deep down the rabbit-hole as you wish to go....

            ...and that hole is very deep indeed.

"Story rich" is a term that has a nice, general sort of meaning to it, but again, does not do the efforts of CDPR proper justice. The game is so tightly wound into the books, that unless you have read them, you constantly miss the references that are so beautifully woven into the tale. If you have not read the books, you don't lose anything, but you definitely gain so much more for the knowledge.

The story, while deep and inviting, is marred a bit by the development of some of the characters. There are some that have a constant impact in the game, but the characters themselves feel somewhat shallow and undeveloped. Yennefer, for example: The character of the books is haughty, proud, complex, and passionate. The game character feels just b*t**y and moody.  Some of them, however, are just delightful and give you real reason to "buy in" to them (Zoltan and Dandelion come immediately to mind).

The environment - I am somewhat of two minds about the environment. Aspects of it are epic...the vistas from on high can be breathtaking. The play of light through trees and the colors at sunrise and sunset are a visual feast. There is a great deal to lend itself to the suspension of disbelief that is critical for immersion into the game world. But there are some things that blow that disbelief up quicker than a grapeshot bomb.  The trees, bushes and grasses look very obviously two-dimensional. It was a disappointment that was lessoned somwhat by the variety in the landscapes, and the impact of weather on it, but it still was a bit of a jarring surprise when taken in context with the overall quality of the environment. Then there are the many inconsistencies in the way Geralt interacts with his environment (swimming on land, the inability to use terrain to your advantage in combat, getting stuck in trees, etc.). 

Combat is by far the best iteration of all the games in the trilogy. It still remains a bit clunky (having to go into inventory, then go to your potions/food/bombs tab, then select the bombs you want to use, then exit out of all that, to have to go into the wheel and select the bomb before you throw it.....is a real pain in the @$$..... would have made far more sense to allow the user to simply click on the bomb slot in the power wheel and get a pop up inventory of just bombs. Same for potions slots and special slots.)  But beyond those inconveniences, the blend of signs and attacks, coupled with dodging, parries, and combat rolls makes for an engaging, flowing combat experience. Some fights are simply acrobatic melees, while others require careful patience, waiting for the right time to strike, while maintaining a stout defense to avoid getting one-shotted.

Now, all this having been said, I have to admit that I was more than a bit disappointed that CDPR fell into the same trap of American publishers: putting the game out before all the bugs were ironed out. There have already been 8 patches and still there remains a plethora of irritating bugs (inability to talk to certain npc's that you should be able to talk to without meditating for an hour first or the flank speed on boats not working are the two most immediate that leap to mind)

Yes, there are pros.
Yes there are cons. 

But even with the cons, I would easily match this to The Mass Effect Trilogy, or the Dragon Age trilogy, as one of the most enjoyable RPG experiences I've ever had in gaming. I've already played the game 3 times, back to back, and working on a 4th with the new Game + (which really is the exact same game with everything made higher level....I've not yet seen a benefit to this yet).

Watching Geralt's beard grow as time goes by was just a huge giggle for me. It was a neat touch. Watching whales in the ocean broach by my boat as I sailed by gave me no end of delight. I parked Geralt on a mountain top in Skellige and watched an entire sunset.  I checked myself into Gwent Addicts Anonymous.

Would I recommend this game? Without a breath of hesitation. Then I would immediately advise to take the bugs with a grain of salt, and get lost in this rather amazing world, and thoroughly enjoyable story.

Go, and see just how deep that rabbit hole is.
You might look through these reviews thinking: "Man, Is this game really as good as the tales foretell?"
And there is just one answer: "It is even better."
This game will urge you to rethink your whole gaming life up to that point and it changes what you can expect from gaming nowadays.
The saga on which it is based is incredible, almost magical and the way the game incorporates it is so thought through. It makes you ponder what else the amazing world of the Witcher has to offer (and it has a lot to offer).
The characters, the gameplay, the astonishingly gorgeous world itself with all its opportunities combined with the plot and drama ascend this game to a higher dimension it seems. It is actually very hard to describe the aspects of the game which make it such an amazing experience. I guess it is just the whole picture which the game draws. While playing the game you can kinda feel the love that is put into every pixel and you just appreciate the amazing work CD Projekt Red has done.

If you have never played a game of the series and if you are enthusiastic about fantasy worlds with all the wonders they hold, definetly try this game! It will enthrall you. The tons of recommendations and awards this game accumulated are more than deserved.
Now have fun and play this beautiful game.
9.7/10

Pros: 
-Beautiful graphics (screenshots below)
-Spectacular soundtrack and atmosphere. The atmosphere created by soundtrack combined with the visuals is unspeakably beautiful. At times you'll be dancing with others in a medieval city to a catchy tune played by the Bards, and at others you're desprately trying to protect your fellow soldiers and loved ones to a powerful theme.
-Decision making. The choices you make in this game ACTUALLY MATTER unlike other choice games these days.
-Beautifully designed weapons, the stats are designed well.
-Balanced skill trees, great varity of spells and other boosts.
-Addictingly fun combat system; you can set people on fire with the spell Igni, blast people away with Aard, control minds and turn enemies against each other with Axii etc.
-Perfect amount of gore. Dismemberment and executions while in combat.
-Voiceacting is well done and is very immersive.
-Plenty of opportunity to explore the cities, villages, dungeons, castles, enchanted forests, caves, valleys and so forth.
-Brilliant storyline focused on the protagonist Geralt of Rivia, and his quest to find and protect the powerful "child of the elderblood", Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (Ciri). The immersion created from the cinematics, soundtrack, and other elements puts you in Geralt's shoes, and will have you wondering if Ciri is far or near; dead or alive.

Cons:
-A few very minor bugs that impact your immersion and overall experience little to none.
-In my experience it's a little overwhelming at the start, like most other RPG's.
-Your horse is pretty retarded
-Every other game you play after this one will never satisfy you.

Here's a short review of the Witcher 3, arguably one of the best if not the best rpg I've played of all time.

I actually had to decide until now if I should get this game or not, because I was afraid it was just overhyped, but  BOIII how wrong I was. I regret that I only played it now, but boy, oh boy, this game is fuckin good.

Pros: 
The world: Which is the game's strongest point, not only is it huge but it is also alive and changes depending on your decision throughout the game. Not gonna get into it much to avoid spoilers.

Combat: While simplified it still required a bit of tactic, especially on death march, P.S Aard ftw. This was why Witcher 1 and especially 2 were hard to get into due to their ridicilous combat mechanics and difficulty, not to mention the controls back then were clunky too, so thanks CDPR.

Story: While the story follows a basic narractive of "Go save this and do that" the way it is being told is amazing, especially the characters which made the journey even more memorable

DLC: The dlc is so good they feel like a completely new game themselves, especially blood and wine, not to mention they also give people free DLC, are the dlc's worth the buy? (Hearts of Stone, Blood and Wine) Yes, very much, for a DLC they offer so much content for the price.

Soundtrack: Not much can be said here, it's freakin GOOOD.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Cons: 

You have to give up on your life to fully experience it all.


The game eventually ends.


Overall: A very good RPG. Which you can craft on how you want to end the White Wolf's legend. A nice send off to the witcher series. (Altho I'm still optimistic about a witcher 4)
I'll never be able to describe the experience as a whole in words, the story and gameplay is just too much.
The DLCs are amazing, price feels just right for the amount of content they add.
I find this a very enjoyable game, beatifully made and written.

Fighting is interesting although simple, the riddles are too much fun to solve,
roaming the beautiful maps is amazing, listening to the music is exciting,
and finishing the game is heartbreaking..

I wish I had a meme or something to finish the review, but this game is worthy of much than that.
I leave my heart here. The feelings the game awoke in me reside in this review.
Feast on them, and know what a real game can make you feel.
[h1]TL;DR Buy it. Full Price even. Then buy the books and the other games. Hitchhike to Poland to pick up a copy if you have to.[/h1]

My wife and I made it a habit to play the  witcher 3 together instead of netflixing or similair over the past few months. It took a few tries to get into it and it was a menacing and daunting task at first. We went into the game totally blind, not knowing anything of the books or the games that came before.

[i]Here I sit, having finished the main storyline and most of the side content (took us 120 hrs.), writing a game review. Something I hardly ever do.
As i write this, there is some dreadful feeling of emtpiness inside me and that's because of two reasons.[/i]

Firstly because over the last few months this was our ritual. Firing up the game, slaying monsters, conversing with peasants and kings alike, laughing, crying and worrying about the situations we found ourselves in. We were genuinely immersed in the struggles of characters big and small, well written and relatable. In the end we sat there, watching the credits. Reflecting on our journey. Seeing Geralt and pals off with the same bittersweet feeling you get when you finish that one book or watch the last episode of your favourite show. You know it's over. Those people you grew attached to, you have to "let them go" in a way. At least we still have the DLCs and the older games to look forward to.

Secondly because I knew it could only go downhill from here. I showed my wife "teh best gaem evarr made". Any other game we will play together after the Witcher 3 will be "it's good, except for XY". You will not find a more complete package. A game that has a story this gripping with good looking, yet well performing graphics and a core gameplay loop as fullfilling. No soundtrack as fitting, no scenery as convincing, no character models as appealing to look at (or appalling, given the need), no world as believeable. CD Projekt Red have put an insane amount of polish (no pun intended) into every bit of this game, no matter how small and insignificant it may have seemed at the time. And you can tell.

To name a few outstanding occurances that made me go "gold star, you Polish guys":
[list]
[*]You can start a quest "sideways" by discovering something accidently you might have not known about yet. The game still finds a way to get you to complete that quest in a way that doesn't feel like its just leading you by the nose. At any point in any quest there is always a logical, understandable and very relatable reason why you're walking from X to Y, doing Z.
[*]We had the chance to visit a character later in the game and take our revenge. We however had already killed said character before. When Geralt said "sure, lets pay that guy a visit", we finally thought we had found a way to break the game with its countless branching story paths. We didn't. Without trying to spoil to much, the game went "did you not pay attention? This character is in the story as well" and we sat there, mouth agape, mesmerized by the fact that the storywriters kept this in mind, just in case someone tries to be funny.
[*]Your choices truly matter. Most of the time, however, not immediately. Morality, Ethics and the question of good and evil have always been the strong suit of the Witcher universe. Something you thought heroic now will come to bite you later. Worse, it usually doesn't come to bite YOU but the characters you grew attached to. The tension in the cutscenes is real because you're never sure you did the "right" thing at some point before. Once we were done with the game we checked the Wiki page and saw what could happened in our playthrough... boy oh boy, we got lucky...
[*]Some peasant tried to talk shit to Geralt. We drew our sword. Said peasant tried not to talk shit anymore.[/list]

Not that I wish to say this game is perfect.[list]
[*]A few glitches and bugs occured, but never to such a point that it broke the game. Think of it as little amusing eastereggs maybe.
[*]All the possibilites, side content, potions and blueprints can be overwhelming at first. Especially in the beginning the game has the very bad habit of popping up ten tutorial textboxes once you pick up a leaf. It really takes some time getting into the game and mechanics, but once you do it grips you.
[*]The combat, although easily the best of the series, can be irritating sometimes. Animations tend to have this long (as in frantic-combat-I'm-trying-to-dodge-this-lightning-bolt-long) blending period in which you might get stunlocked or Geralt flat out refuses to acknowledge your button inputs (looking at you, fistfighting right after parrying). The camera, both locked on and not can also be dodgy sometimes. I imagine once I replay this on a harder difficulty it will be responsible for the occasional teeth grind. Maybe it's better with mouse and keyboard, I couldn't tell as we played on controller.[/list]

To finish of this [strike]boo[/strike], review:
Get this game. Even if you don't like RPGs. Even if you don't really care about video games too much. CD Projekt Red deserves your money. They are the antithesis to EA, Activision and comparable companies that put money first and everything second. CDPR made their way from shoddy Neverwinter-Nights-Engine Games which you had to try really hard to love them in spite of their flaws all the way a triple A game Studio, that can easily give Bethesda a run for their money, had they been given close to the same kind of publicity.
[h1]BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED![/h1]
[h1]BEST STORY![/h1]
[h1]BEST GRAPHICS![/h1]
[h1]BEST MUSIC![/h1]

Completed main story + 2 dlc + most of the side quests in [i]120 hours[/i] and all I want to do is play it again. And I will.
Never has a game [b]"completed me"[/b] such as this masterpiece has. This game gave me so much feelings, that I belive no other game could provide me at least 1/3 of it. 
I belive this is the [u]best game ever created[/u], or, at least, it's the best game of this period or century. We will have to wait 10 years to see another game like this...
A great game with a lot of depth and choices that looks and sounds absolutely stunning.

Having just finished my first playthrough, there's still a lot things that I need to see and expierence, but unlike the second game in the series I know it'll take me a good 60 to 70 hours to get there. The game sucks you in and takes you for a ride that's filled with all kinds of diversions, but never gets too overwhelming.

The writing and quest design is very good. Hardly any side quest or contract is a simple fetch quest. All have something unique about them. The main quest and its 'spin-off' side quests are what makes the game really amazing though. If you've played the first two games (and/or read the books) you'll meet a lot of characters again. There's so much to do and you always have a choice (that matters) how to tackle the tasks. 

Geralt's world is interesting and while one of the areas you'll play in (the biggest one) feels a bit too dark and bleak (which makes sense given the current situation there), the rest of the areas is just gorgeous. Especially Toussaint from the Blood and Wine DLC is just beautiful.

The graphics and the animations are great. You can see emotions on faces and when you see your first drunk stumbling through Novigrad, you'll wonder why other games don't put that much detail into their game world. The dawn and dusk lighting effects add a lot of atmosphere to the game. Same goes for the sound effects and the music in the game. Just an example of the music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWbE5sgL8bc
There are a few nit-pick problems that are far from being important, but at times they can get a bit annoying. For one enemies with a shield are weirdly overpowered. You can use your signs to break through their defense and try to roll behind them, but the way they block every hit from the front can get irritating. Another small issue is the movement control when using mouse and keyboard. Quite often you have to examine exact spots on the floor and using the keyboard to position Geralt can be tedious. Using an analogue joypad it's a lot easier to do it. The last complain is the UI. I understand that there's a lot of elements that had to be included and the tutorial is very good, but still I found the UI to be a bit overburdened and not very intuitive to use.

Overall this game is really a masterpiece that will not only entertain RPG fans a lot. It's absolutely worth the price and you should at least get the Blood and Wine expansion.
[h1]Pros:[/h1]
- I just completed the main story and most of secondary quests and witcher contracts and still have DLC contents to play after this. All I can say, this is masterpiece. One of the Best RPG game I ever played (November 2018 I started playing the DLC contents, Hearts of Stone & Blood and Wine)
- Huge open world to explore
- Great graphics. Visually stunning
- Great storyline
- Good gameplay mechanic
- Decent combat mechanic
- A lot of choices to make (like choices matter dialogue, etc)
- This game has a great contents and somewhat high replayability (for different consequences, choices to make, DLC's contents, different endings, etc)

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- You can't go to game menu or pause the game when the game in cutscenes mode. Almost large portion of the game storyline came from its cutscenes, it's unfortunate for those who want to take a phone call, had to pee, or any other multitasking, etc. You will misssed some of its story content

Overall I recommend this game
9.5/10

[h1] 9.8/10 -Kate [/h1]
A game that plays like a movie; with compelling characters and intricate storyline, set in a huge world with lots of things to do and places to discover. Excellent visuals and superb voice acting complete the experience for the flagship game of a successful franchise: increasingly polished series, ending with a true masterpiece.

This game is centered on its main story, and has lots of cutscenes and dialogue. It was designed like an interactive movie with lots of rich, interesting characters and meaningful decisions. Do not expect continuous, mindless combat or a dull, weapon-collecting, inventory-centered experience.

[i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] is a game to enjoy at ease, taking time to appreciate the environment and to understand the lore. There is so much content and quests that no two gameplays will be the same. You can play for 60 hours, finish the main quest and storyline and still have half the game’s content to see.

The quests are really detailed and well thought, a far cry from mindless fetch, kill and gather missions that plague so many other games, be them action, RPG or hack and slash. Every quest in [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] comes together as a coherent piece of a complex universe, entangled in the politics of war, the difficulties of survival and the grim existence in a morally-ambiguous world.

Several decisions made by the player can be game-changing, and you will live to see the consequences of many of your actions, even small and unimportant-looking ones. [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] has different endings, depending on what you did and who you chose to help (or not). 

Killed characters are gone for good, and most quests will present options that do not exactly adhere to the regular good-or-evil clear-cut paths that most other games take for granted. Not even choosing a lover will be an easy decision for Geralt de Rivia.

This is a game aimed at adults, with lots of intrigue, corruption, murder, prostitution, racism, exploitation, crime, nudity and sex. The combat animations are gory and brutal, featuring plenty of beheading and dismemberment.

The sprawling, immersive world was painstakingly created, and it shows. The attention to details is astonishing, be it the texture of an armor, the warpaint of an enemy or the design of a mountain stronghold. The lighting, shadows and water effects make for very beautiful landscapes. The only environmental effect I find not quite to my liking is the propensity for very strong winds, which shake the trees but leave the smoke from chimneys intact, thus breaking the immersion a bit. The music is adequate and sets the right tone. However, there should be more moments of silence every now and then.

The combat is serviceable and the controls could be somewhat improved, but this is not a specialized action or hack and slash game. The real-time menu for weapons, signs and bombs is quite uncomfortable, and aiming the crossbow is hard with a controller, but the responsiveness of the actions is generally good. Another thing I dislike is Geralt’s weird, jumpy death animation.

Those that want to roleplay should bear in mind that this is not an RPG, but a game with RPG elements. You cannot create or heavily customize characters, apart from clothing and some of Geralt’s skills, and you cannot—and should not—go crazy over DPS stats and numbers. This is no fault or mistake; [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] was simply not designed that way.

The DLCs are some of the best I’ve seen, generously adding to the main experience and providing new story arcs, places characters and equipment. Lots of Free-LC enable even more customizing options. [i]Gwent[/i], the game-within-a-game, is an interesting take on minigames from previous installments of this franchise. Easy to learn, quick to play and with an interesting amount of strategy, will keep most completionists looking for cards right until the very end of the main quest.

With its few flaws and quirks, [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] can still be considered a masterpiece of gaming and a new classic of mixed-genre, bringing together elements of storytelling, RPGs, action and open world games.

Of course, no manmade project can ever be perfect, but you don’t criticize Picasso’s [i]Guernica[/i] or Leonardo’s [i]Gioconda[/i] by focusing only on their glitches and flaws. What makes a classic is both [b]uniqueness worthy of imitation[/b] and the [b]timeless relevance[/b] that will keep the object on sight for generations to come. Both Picasso and Da Vinci achieved that, as well as Mozart, Lloyd Wright, Shakespeare, and yes, [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i].

For sure, one of the highlights of modern gaming and among the best games ever created. [i]The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt[/i] was met with near-universal acclaim, and such reputation is well earned.

Unconditionally recommended.
The game is on sale as of me writing this review  and anyone who is going through the reviews instead of buying it actually wasting their time. BUY THIS GAME ASAP. I bought the game at full price and still think i underpaid for it .  Won't find a better rpg than this . As a skyrim fan who played skyrim for 500+ hours I was overwhelmed by how good The Witcher 3 is.
I never understood it's hype until i played.
Great Story.
Real fun side quests.
The dlcs are so good they can be seperate games . The heart of stone dlc has a better story than many AAA games .
Actual effect on the story because of the choices you make.
Good mechanics.
The game is 99.9% bug free and highly optimized.
The characters are really well done with each of them feeling unique and not like other games with a range of similar npcs.
I think the only con of this it is you won't find a better game after playing it.
10/10 
FUCKING BUY IT
The story of the game is so beautiful. That's why I can't say anything about game and if you haven't yet entered the witcher universe, you should buy and play.
Easily the best RPG I've ever played and one of the very best video games in general. I really struggle to find negative things to say about this game, it's characters, it's world, it's great deep story telling..a true gem that doesn't come along very often. I recommend every single gamer play through this even if they aren't fans of RPG or fantasy games. I really hope CDPR aren't finished with the Witcher universe and we see more games.
Extremly good game!

+Amazing story
+Good combat
+Great side-quest
+Awesome DLC
+Very good music

-Geralt can't take a 2cm fall

Put 130+ hours in this game the last 2 weeks.

WORTH A BUY!
121 hours into the game I have finally beaten the main story line. I don't write reviews much but this game is definitely worth writing one for. The story was always interesting enough to keep me going and the numerous side activities were fun to participate in. 
I would totally recommend this game to anyone who is interested in story driven games.
Without a doubt, The Witcher III is the greatest single player game I have ever played.

Games are a uniquely powerful medium, one that lends themselves to both 'on rails' and 'free' gameplay. A game that is 'on rails' is something akin to Tomb Raider (2013) or Life is Strange; they're games that place heavy emphasis on the story, using pre-set movements and animations to create a flowing, cinematic experience. 

Conversly there are also 'free' games - games such as Skyrim, where the emphasis is on the players actions - you're the main character of this world, you get to explore it.

Few games can mix the cinematic feeling of an 'on rails' game and the freedom of a 'free' game, yet The Witcher III does so perfectly. I both feel completely in control of my actions, and yet I am also watching a cinematic experience. 

I'm going to try and break down the three elements I believe are the strongest in The Witcher III:

Story, Locations and Music.

Story:

The story of The Witcher III, is, at its core, very simple - you are a witcher. You kill monsters, and you're trying to find a girl. But a story is more than the summary, it's the people in it, and trust me, the characters feel like people. Triss, Yennefer, Ciri, Geralt, Dandelion, they all feel like perfectly fleshed out characters. At times they feel like actors performing as themselves, because they truly feel so real, there's almost a disconnect - they're so realistically human yet simply side characters to a game, it's incredible. Each feels like they could be the main character of their own.

Locations:

The locales of The Witcher III are heavily inspired by slavic reality, Novigrad is simply Novogorod, and it's truly beautiful - the diversity of war torn Temeria, the Tuscan-inspired splendour of Toussaint, the bustling merchant city of Novigrad, the scandavian-irish-scottish influenced Ard Skelig all tell their own story through their aesthetics, people, dialects, and questlines. Every area feels like this is the 'main' area with its own culture - truly making you feel like you're just another person in this huge world, and it creates such a large and beautiful space to understand.

Music:

Music is the best, isn't it? Game scores can be inspiring, egging us onwards and calming us afterwards. Witcher III does music is beautiful, so perfectly - 'You're Immortal', 'Fields of Ard Skelig' and 'The Slopes Of The Blessure' will never leave my music playlists. The musical influences - polish folk songs for Temeria / Redania, italian and french music for Toussaint and celtic influences in Ard Skelig help create this diverse world before you that perfectly sets the scene. Marcin Przybyłowicz and Mikolai Stroinski both deserve just as much praise as the art directors.

I know this review hasn't touched gameplay much, because ultimately, The Witcher III's core focus isn't sword play, it's a story being told in front of you, but unlike, say, Skyrim, you can actually influence this spectacular world you have been presented.

CDProjekt Red have re-defined what a game could be, for me. Sure, if you value skill and core gameplay more than the games story and environments, Witcher III mightn't be for you. But for those seeking a storyline and environments to inspire them, characters to grip them, and ultimately one of the best swan songs in gaming, hell, media history, then please, do yourself a favour and pick up The Witcher III.

10/10.
The Witcher 3 should have won an Oscar, First title that I've played that is more like a book, a film, a musical, a video game and a dream all rolled into one. Some serious eye candy (Yennifer).  
I couldn't find a single fault with this game, not one!  So Ive listed them in order below the line below:

My only faults are:
1: Just to play for 60 minutes, takes an whole hour! @$%*?! ( I have screenshots to prove this (sorry only in English)
2: If you exit the game you can no longer play it, until you load again.
3: If you press pause the game freezes.  (quick fix! if you press pause again it starts playing) I know right!
4: If you play the game again after finishing, you start to see the same things (this happened on numerous occasions, also I have photographic proof of this. Almost becomes unplayable after the 4th time round)
5: Page 6 of the manual is on page 2 (It used to be 2 pages after the last page (i have tried to recreate this to take photographic proof, but sadly to no avail)
6: It doesn't have micro transations
7: Unless you know Polish you will find it very hard to understand the Polish audio setting (TIP: Play on English vocals, works for me, and im British ?)
And last quick tip: If you dont have a keyboard and mouse, you can use a controller!

But seriously it is one of the best games i have ever played, a true must have title from a company you can really trust CD Projekt Red. Just look at the review graph "Overwhelming" by us for us rating cant lie.. Just buy it now if you don't like it, I will give you the money back.
Another reason to buy: It doesn't use DRM, they use Guilty Conscience software protection, guilt stops you from pirating this game and it works.
Almost 100% on Xbox, 'bout to finish the second run on pc. 
If you have the chance, play it on pc, it looks even more great than it does on console, but PLAY IT.

Until now (and I think certainly for a long time) the best game I played, based on story, open world, charakters... most likely everything!
If you like RPG's this is a must have... I would have written, if this was I review about a game like... Skyrim, Fallout, Diablo maybe.
But this game is a must have for you if you like good video games!
I've just played too many RPG's I guess.  They all bore me before I hardly even begin.  If I manage to stick it out it is usually because I just skip through all the story and just hack stuff to death in a grind to play what usually just becomes an inventory management game then or whatever.

That certainly isn't the case thus far with The Witcher.  It seems to be so well put together not just from the story perspective but also in the way that the world feels so open and sandbox like, yet still doesn't leave me clueless as to what I'm suppose to do next or where I might want to head.  It is and isn't leading you, it's such a tough thing to balance right but I enjoy it like no other.

Combat is interesting with quite a bit of focus on defensive moves.  The spells thus far are pretty neat as well. The overall "Witcher effect" I've seen before in other games, or at least something similar, but it really shines here in the way the story seems to embrace it in varying ways.  Haven't done much yet with the crafting but it looks to be as well put together as the rest.

I'm enjoying the game enough that I'm even listening to any obvious side story tales.  The voice acting is just as good as the writing on these.  If any are cliche you'd hardly notice.

The graphics are absolutely stunning turned all the way up and the overall user interface might just be perfection for an RPG.

Yes I'm really enjoying The Witcher, and glad I've already picked up the DLC's.  I'll definitely update as I play more as I'm hoping my opinion stays strong...
Witcher 1: Finding Salamandra
Witcher 2: Finding Letho
Witcher 3: Finding Ciri


Game was GREAT played longer than 
the previous two witcher games combined
just B-E-A-UTIFUL
As returning monster hunter, Geralt of Rivia, you are faced with the ongoing work of problem solver and fell creature slayer, as you search for your daughter-figure and one time ward Ciri who is in danger. 

I started playing The Witcher series years ago and felt that the first two games were worthy of praise and provided an extensive amount of lore based content as well as a riveting combat style. The major difference between this game and its Witcher predecessors is the introduction of a colossal open world with such stunning attention to detail. 

The world in which the story takes place has a thematic approach to the extraordinary amounts of turbulence, starting with the excellent character development, excellent lore base story, an excellent fluid combat system, and fascinating exploration style. This turbulence draws players into an immersive experience based upon conflict and choices. 

The Witcher 3 is brilliantly designed to strike a balance between complicated struggles and problems that allows a good amount of breathing room to engage in crafting, exploring and side-quests.

The women of Witcher 3 play a vital and familiar role in this story. We remember many of them from past chronicles, the most powerful of them are former members of the Lodge of Sorceresses. In addition to these barely likable characters' is the stories' main plot female, Ciri, who has been missing for a long time and is now in peril from an otherworldly faction. The game takes the role-playing experience with Ciri to another level as it periodically lets you take control of her and engage in combat using a slim but powerful combat style. 

KIlling, problem-solving, exploring and treasure hunting round out the experience as you progress through a choices-matter story. It is so detailed that entire chunks of content could be skipped unintentionally if you make a wrong decision, barring you from succeeding quests further along in the chain. Geralt himself sometimes feels akin to some monsters that display qualities of reasoning, intelligence, emotions and a desire to be part of the human-dominated world they live in.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who can stomach a fair amount of blood and gore, is not offended by brief female chest nudity and a rather large commitment of time to unravel the story. In addition to a compelling rich, choices-matter story is the massive scope of main and side quests that are available. The world is environmentally and atmospherically stunning. The game is performance friendly to most PC's that have been manufactured with within the last five years. The developers made a jewel of a role-playing game that should provide at least 200 hours of spent solving the main story. Additional side quests and downloadable content, as well as a growing mod base, make this game a well-priced game for your library.
GRAPHICS- FAN FUCKIN TASTIC.
GAMEPLAY- 9/10 (Only swimming and horseriding feels a bit unresponsive sometimes)
STORY- AWESOME but a bit repetative sometimes

OVERALL- LOVE THIS GAME SO FAR. GET IT JUST GET IT. Can get GOTY, its really cheap (as for lunar sale 2019)

OVERALL RATING 9.2 :D
Just a gosh darn rad game, honestly. I don't feel like writing a fleshed out review, so here are some quick details.

+ Super cool devs
+ Really cheap on sale ($15 for game + all DLC right now)
+ DLC is absolutely superb
+ Incredible monsters, lore, quests, and maps
+ Graphics still look good in 2019
+ i7 and GTX 1070 runs at a steady 75+ fps at 1080p with Hairworks on (drops in some cities a little bit)
+ Has an excellent long story, and the open world is packed with side quests and other stuff
+ Has a trading card game called Gwent. I didn't care for it at first, but I ended up having a lot of fun with it
+ Music and sounds are sweet
+ Your actions pave consequences
+ Devs really know how to paint an immersive atmosphere
+ u get to have secks
+ Fight stupid ass drunkards who seriously think they can beat up a Witcher
- Long sessions of dialogue can get pretty tiring after a while
- Kinda confusing to understand the full backstory if you haven't played the prequels, but I made it through fine

I can't wait to see what CD Projekt Red has in store for us with Cyberpunk.
The witcher is a documentary in which you follow the story of a man who works as a monster slayer in order to feed his crippling addiction to a card game
Best single player game of all time. Combined with Huge open world map, Flawless storytelling, Amazing graphics,sound & smooth gameplay undoubtedly the best game of all time. After playing this no game will satisfy you. Especially after playing Blood & Wine its hard to like other games.

Hats off to CDPR. Best developer.
This game is probably one of the best games ever created but the only downside is that it ruined other games for me because this game will always be my standard for a good game.
Truly a masterpiece of modern game design.  Great combat, compelling stories, incredible landscapes and graphically astounding.  Your choices truly affect the outcome of the game and make for real replay-ability.  The game's script has 420,000 words and 72,000 lines of dialog delivered by 950 speaking roles... a feat I am not sure any other game can boast.  Especially when you consider the number of languages it is in.  Combined with Heart of Stone and Blood & Wine this makes for quite a lengthy game so you are getting quite an experience for your money.  Even my extended play time represented leaving many side quests undone after a time and vowing to stave off of playing Gwent any more as I was making slow progress on the main game.  Bottom line:  This is now the definitive single player RPG that all other AAA titles should be measured against and I doubt anyone will come close for a good long while.
The greatest game I've ever played. The Witcher 3 has ruined single player gaming for me. I crave for RPGs with stories this deep, characters this well written and quests this good and I honestly haven't been able to find one. This game doesn't reinvent the wheel, nor does it do any one thing particularly superlatively-its the sum of all parts that makes this a masterpiece.
Played 143 hours for one playthrough. One of the best games ever made. I'm going for a second run to get the missing achievements and trying new game +.
There is not something I can say that hasn't already been spouted out.  I will proceed to say what has already been said and say that this is an outstanding game. My only gripe is not with the game itself, but with the fact that there are so few games that had left such an impression on me. I thoroughly enjoyed the feel of this game and the immersion I experienced the first couple playthroughs. I haven't really had such a good time in a game since Metal Gear Solid on PS1 or FFIIIV.
Well worth any price, on sale or otherwise. Incredibly gripping and expansive. You will not run out of things to do. I hope everyone at least gives this game a try. I was unsure at first as RPGs aren't really my thing but this game shattered my expectations. I have been hooked for hours at a time. The side quests are meaningful and nonrepetitive. The GOTY edition is also worth it. The only draw backs that I can think of is that a lot of the game mechanics might me overwhelming at first. Just keep playing and you will figure it out.
[b]The third entry in the Witcher game series that can take up to dozens of hours just to go from the beginning to the end of the base game.[/b] It doesn't require you to play the other two games exactly as the main plot of this is kind of its own thing, but it makes loads of references to them so it can be really easy to not understand or just take in why recurring characters appear the way they do and such.

The gameplay has gotten very controller-focused as the sequels went on, but it's still playable with a keyboard and mouse.
Running the game with every graphics settings on max requires some heavy hardware, especially when you enter populated city areas in this game where it can easily kill your frame-rate or at the very least have it stuttering a lot.

Combat & gameplay in general in this game is both really simple and really broken in more ways than one.
It doesn't take much skill to fight and beat anything; side-step/back-step to dodge, attack, dodge, attack, repeat. Sometimes the enemy changes it up a little, like they'll fly, teleport, or dig underground, but that's more just delaying the fight as opposed to bringing in a challenge.
The whole game's mechanics are wonky when they're not being simple, and there are too many examples of this; using a certain magic skill will sometimes waste stamina without the animation at least trying to play out as intended, you don't always go through the reload animations after using a crossbow, hitboxes are confusing for both the enemy and Geralt, environmental physics can interrupt gameplay on a constant basis, and so on.
In addition to the broken gameplay, there are just poor design choices overall, like a lack of organization within almost the entirety of the inventory menus, disabling the jump feature when in combat, extremely high level quests being right next to extremely low level ones, being only able to track one quest at a time, etcetera etcetera. 
All of that and there are also loads of bugs in this game that haven't been addressed.

The gameplay of these games were never really the focus, which is probably why they're often poorly executed. Being originally based on a series of books by the same name, the story focus is strong.
There are massive amounts of quests in this game ranging from simple treasure hunts to witcher contracts that just need you to kill a monster to stories that may get a big-named character killed. They're all interesting in their own way and are what will take up most of your time. Even the treasure hunts can get interesting since they all start with messages that show a little backstory as to why the treasure is there to begin with; you even get to see a little summary in the quest log for these along with every quest you complete written by Geralt's old bard friend.
There are various ways to do many of the quests in this game, whether they depend on the dialogue options you choose when speaking to characters or just how you approach them altogether. Some quests can even start in very different locations; for example, you can start a kill-a-monster quest by coming across the monster itself accidentally as opposed to finding the noticeboard where you're intended to start it, in a way being able to complete the quest before it even actually begins.
The writing in this game is very well done. There's a lot of it and is well-structured. However, it's so massive, that it can feel like an info-dump at times.
There are loads of times when you get dialogue options, but it can be very hard to tell when they actually affect the current story.
When faced with moral decisions, the writing does seem to be heavily biased towards playing hero as the rewards are often much higher and the stories in question go on longer. You don't even get a few EXP for being a true neutral witcher and saying "I'm staying out of it" as the quest just fails or becomes no longer available right then & there.

Exploring is almost half the game. It's incredibly atmospheric and the maps are extremely massive, and it's a more gorgeous sight with the graphics turned up all the way to max.

The game's a huge entry in the Witcher series. If you still have a Witcher 2 save file in your hard drive, you can import it onto here and some of the choices you made there will affect some parts of this game.
You get a whole lot for the base price. On sale, the base game with the DLC bundled becomes the same price as the game by itself when [i]that's[/i] on sale.
The game is really as good as it sounds and really lived up to its commendations.Definitely worth the money and time.Really happy that i got the happy ending on my first play through,yay!

And also time really flies as you play this game
This game is so good, it made me learn every single bit of it´s story and lore.  This was the best use of 60 euros (including DLCs) in my entire life. If there could be only one game I would recommend, it would be this one. A must play.
I just have to write a review for this game: The Wither Wild Hunt is just soooo good! This is the first time Im writing a review, and this is also the first time I get so hooked at an RPG. I am not a hardcore gamer, and these 156 hours are definitely well spent. Anyway, RPG lovers trust me, you are definitely gonna like this!
[h1] You have to play this game. [/h1]

The Witcher series follows Geralt of Rivia, professional monster hunter, and witcher from the school of the wolf.
Geralt is a complex character with a fantastic backstory and interesting development. You play as Geralt, and make decisions in his stead. Ultimately, his story cannot change entirely based on your output. His story is so well crafted and narrated that you wouldn't want to, however. 

The gameplay is as solid as the story. Combat is satisfying, movement is fluid, and the game features skill points and tree allocation. Fighting monsters feels fantastic and weighted. The Witcher 3 also features a minigame-- gwent, which is well known for its playability and enjoyment. You can sink plenty of hours into a game INSIDE of a game, and its great.

This game stole my heart; and the DLC only takes it further away. Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine are two of the best DLCs of this era. It feels so naturally implemented that it belongs in the base game. They feature more well-desired story and brand new characters to converse with. New gear and monsters are also added. 

I've said it once, and i'll say it again; just to be clear.

You HAVE to play this game. It's an experience like no other.
Best game in the world. 


Game,Developer and Publisher gets 10/10 turned me from a pirate to a legitmate buyer.

Company policies deserve to be supported. Unlike the subhumans at EA.
2nd time buying this game.I first finished it on GOG so I decided to buy the game on steam too.('cuz is too good)
I have no words truly an amazing experience.
Everything AND I MEAN EVERYTHING about this game is near perfection.
EVERYTHING fron the gameplay to the story,the sounds,the music the atmoshere, the mechanics EVERYTHING is so satisfying and well made.Sure the horse can be a pain in the a$$ some time and this mutant can die from a 4m fall BUT this are small nitpicks.The story is amazing.The character developement and the relations between them feels so alive and imersive.A story with verry few clichés side mission that can be story on their own.The mechanics of this game at first glance seem overwhelming but the teaches you what u have to do and how it doesnt hold your hand nor it is easy.It is challenging and fun.
When people talk about gaming being a new form of art this game this game the evidence of that.
This game is a masterpiece and should be treated as one.
I played pirate version for about 150 hours, passed 2 times for different endings. The best I've seen is an interesting continuation of the previous part, patching up the mistakes of the previous one.
10/10, nothing more to tell.
I bought it here to support the developers and show respect. Not for any game I did not do that.
Where to start. From the great story to the amazing open world to the even better enemy design, this game does not cease to amaze me. It has everything you need from a good RPG with many interesting and diverse side quests and different outcomes depending on how you react to certain things. There is not a single argument against getting this game. If you like RPGs, chances are you will love this one.
Amazing game. I can tell this was their passion project. The amount of quality and content is unmatched compared to their competition. This was their first attempt at the open world with such a scale, yet they were able to achieve a new standard when it comes to the genre, raising the bar much higher, proving that it does not take crazy amount of funds, investors or monetization to achieve it. I will be talking about this game many years to come, even revisit whenever I feel like I needed to be reminded that there was a time when games were made by people who had same interest as their audiences.
[b]The Witcher 3 is near perfection.[/b]

Before playing The Witcher 3 a couple years ago I had never played a Witcher game before, the overwhelmingly positive reviews and [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHrskkHf958]awesome trailer[/url] caused me to buy this masterpiece.

Graphically it looks great, it has plenty of graphics options to finetune thus making it easier to run on older systems.

As a newcomer to the series, I really enjoyed the story and all the lore. The voice's of the characters are all really well done, the world is very lived in and has a lot of detailed places
and also all the different monsters and how to defeat them is also quite cool.

As I said above, it's nearly a masterpiece. The Witcher 3 still has some flaws, movement and combat can feel a bit clumsy like it's made for a controller. Some locations in the map are filled with copy paste collectibles and sometimes it feels like they put animations over gameplay. But these flaws don't take away the fact that this game is awesome and you should buy it.

TL;DR, Awesome graphics, great gameplay, compelling quests, and an unmatched atmosphere.

Great job CD Projekt Red, looking forward to play Cyberpunk 2077
Can't believe this came out almost 4 years ago. Still looks and plays like a game made in 2019. If Cyberpunk is half as good as this game, we'll be in for one hell of a time
Great game! I had been playing this game by ~50 hours (A non-license version). And just now I decided to buy it in Steam. 
Very interesting dialogs, quests also DLC`s. But the game has a very crappy navigator.
That`s all, bye!
Witcher 3 is a masterpiece, no wonder that it has so many positive reviews. At first I was sceptical about the game and unsure whether I would complete it. I gave it another go and when I went deeper into the story I was so into it that whenever I would quit playing, for the rest of the day I would wonder what would happen next. The game truly is amazing and there will always be haters who will moan about anything for example "raaah, the game's combat is wonky raaah" but the fact is that if the combat would get changed, people would moan that it is is too complicated and too hard. I fell in love with the story and even the DLCs are worth every penny. The game on sale is a steal and I would suggest getting GOTY version as it is definitely worth it. 10/10
Very good game, The story and character development is amazing. Add to that that the world is vast and beautiful and it doesn't feel lonely like in other games like Skyrim. The combat system is far from perfect tho its quite easy with minimal variety.
Bought this game and after 2 hours of gameplay later realized the GOTY edition priced the same as normal one. Thanks Steam for not notifying me in any way that there's a better version of it.
Fuckin' yes mate. It's stunning, performs surprisingly well on my rather old build (GTX770 - Ryzen 3 1200). I was rather hesitant about the combat and gameplay, but i'm loving it so far!
The world is alive and insanely beautiful, there's a big ol' bunch of customization, some challenging quests, and a load of ways you can approach those quests!
Definitely worth a try! Recommended.
This is a MAGNIFICENT game, even may compare with Skyrim in my opinion.
Spent 200hr to finish the game and two DLC and finally got bored. Qwent was too easy once you get those spy cards (I set it the most difficult and never lose). Combat is full of <shift>key, which is a little boring. CDPR may learn from those Japanese companies how to build a playable combat system. 
Heart of Stone is really something WORTH playing. The story of Blood and Wine is conventional and predictable actually. Even so, the gorgeous view of Toussaint and a house with a huge vineyard and your loved one sleeping inside is worth paying.
I am not willing to and I have no spare time to play new game+, since I tried every option when first-time play by S/L and other things will be totally the same. 
I chose the one with the smell of Lilac and gooseberry btw : )
The Witcher 3 came out in May of 2015 and the gameplay+graphics still hold up. It is a RPG masterpiece. Fun quests, great main story, and tons of replay value. Geralt is a lovable character that I hope CD Projekt Red is not done with. Buy the game!
what a game !

the environment is just so damn gorgeous, character progression is on point and the leveling system is just perfect.
so many different weapons and armor sets.
The things i mostly enjoy are the treasure hunt and witcher contracts.
even the smallest side quests are so interesting.

9.8/10

-0.2 because fall damage is a bitch !
Rare Game i would say. Good Storyline , Good Gameplay , Good Graphics , Combat System  u name it Witcher 3 has it. more better if u play the entire series. Guarantee u wont regret the game after getting it. Only thing u dont have Like other as our own like other Openworld RPG's is a house ;) but who needs a house when u got "ROACH ".

"BEST GAME EVER"
 I bought this game during the steam lunar sale for 300 rupees ( 4 dollars and 40 cents ) and i am seriously disappointed at myself for not buying it for the full price. I had previously played witcher 1 and 2 on my console and they were okay at best (6.5 for the first one because of somewhat of a unusual combat and a solid 7 for the 2nd one , liked the story but didnt quite like the linearity of the game ) and i absolutely had zero idea what i was going into since it was going to be the first open world RPG developed by CD project RED . I saw many reviews about the game and they all praised it and held it in high regard . unfortunately my pc was garbage at that time when this game came out so i completely let this game slip under my radar. when i actually started playing the game i was seriously shocked (in a good way) and dumbfounded that how can a game have so much content and that too good content. 

All the side missions are excellent and kinda necessary as there will be an epic fight during the final act of the game where you can ask all these characters to join you in the fight. the story is excellent . the soundtrack is excellent. There are absolutely no bugs (none that i have encountered) .the mission design is excellent. Nothing feels out of place here . plus there are 2 outstanding DLC s which open up 2 completely new locations with different enemies and different quests . you can invest 100 hours into this game easily and still you wont be bored and still there will be something in the game for you to do. 

TL;DR overall i really dont think a rating out of 10 will do justice to this masterpiece but if it has to be a rating system i would give it 10/10 . it is really a must have.

Overall The Witcher 3 is an example that development studios exist who dont chase after the green bill and actually love making games for us the gaming community and publishers who dont force developers to rush out a half baked cake (Im looking at you EA)
So I played the hell out of this on the Xbox One when it came out (did not have a PC with the graphics card to run it for the PC at the time) and loved it.  Always wanted the PC version (especially after seeing streams of the PC version and the gorgeous graphics) so i picked it up on a sale with the other Witcher Games and have to say I love the PC version even more than I dug the Xbox version.  This game is deceptively huge.  You don't really get the depth of the game as you follow the story, but if you do all of the sidequests and missions there are days and days of extra work just there.
[b]Ignore me having 30 hours on this account, I finished the game twice on a cracked version.[/b]

[h1]The long review of this game[/h1]
First thing that i want to tell you is the pros and cons.
Pros:
✔️Huge, coherent and immersive game world
✔️Game systems and storyline both engage
✔️Beautifully rendered characters and scenery
✔️Crammed with interesting quests, side-quests and activities
✔️Geralt a more mature and sympathetic lead
✔️The immense variety of mods that u can install(but just do it after u finished the game)
Cons:
❌The horse movement it's not bad , but not to good aswell
❌For me was hard to learn how to play gwent, even on the easy difficulty, i thank to my friend who made me understand it
❌Underwater controls are meh. (only applys to keyboards)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I mean where do I even begin, I am genuinely surprised about the amount of quality and love was put into this game. The story is beatifully crafted and intresting to play. The combat is fun and has the right amount of challenge, along with awsome spells you use. Plus the combinations of making potions and armors/swords makes this a solid combat system with variety. What really got me about this game is the choices you have to make. All the choices in this game are morally grey, just like real life.  The soundtrack is excellent and really gets you involved in the game. The developers, CD Project Red actually care about the fans and made a fantastic game. Overall I fully recommend this game if your are a RPG lover.
                  [h1] This game will always have a special place in my heart.﻿ Thank you, CD PROJEKT RED.[/h1]
This game is like a movie. The characters are amazing and different. The main story is about finding a girl named ciri. She's fled for a long time because the wild hunt is after her. The reson being is that she is the only thing holding them back from taking over the land. It is a good story with a lot of tough decisions on which path to take. After you are done with the main story there are tonnes of side quests and unexplored land to unveil and solve. The protagonist Geralt of Rivia is a wither that slays monsters and helps the people. He's pretty humble and likeable. I'm only 36 hours in as i'm wrtiting this review. I've only just scratched the surface of what can be found throughout of the land. 
The game has been praised by game critics all around for a good reason. 
That was all i had to say. Now i'm gonna jump into the world of the witcher and do some exploring.
Cya
The best game of the century . Congratulations to the CD PROJEKT RED company for the successful game they made. The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt has become the best game in the world, with an unrepeatable narrative of love and romance and sex scenes. Excellent environmental graphics The game is without flaw. Well, I love this game <3 

Le Witcherino Tres follows the morally grey story of Gelato del Fruitcake. Accompany Gordon von Ramsey as he serves up some exquisite witchery while making all the choices that lead to the best scenes that have viewer discretion advisories. In short, the story of Witchyman is an underrated gem. 10/10
played Witcher 2 for 10 hrs and just couldnt get into the game.. felt more like a chore than a fun game.. thought this 3rd game was almost same just with bigger maps, boy was i wrong! this game became one of my all time favorite games.. truly is a masterpiece!
Witcher 3 summary

Gameplay: Overall great. There is a fair bit to tinker with from upgrades to potions, skills, bombs, items, gwent cards and much more. Most things are easy to access in game and or in menus. Plenty of guides and in game instruction to point you in the right direction. Some quests can be a bit buggy but if you continue to play the game out you should be ok in my experience

Combat: Very simplistic and effective combat. it does however get very dry very quick if your into more complex or fighting style based games. 

Graphics: Top of the line graphics for its year and system requirements

Story: About as good as any game I have played. Very in-depth and lots of time/effort to make  it and keep it interesting. Both in game and out side of game lore is nicely done and makes sense.

Monsters/Characters/NPC's: Excellent. I did honestly feel more cycling and different monsters 
                                             could be added instead of re-using the same ones in different 
                                             regions but that is being picky.

Extras/Addons/Expansions: Blood and Wine is a very nice expansion. Lots of great content. Hearts of Stone is not as big as Blood and Wine. some nice quests and a whole new element to items and upgrades. Gwent in its own right is a fantastic well balanced game let alone fun additional element to a much bigger game.  I was very addicted to gwent when I finally started playing.

Music/Sound: The music is pretty good and the sound is usually relevent to whats happening in the game.

Overall: There are still so many aannoying bugs that make me want to throw my computer through a window and with overly simplistic combat style that gets dry quick the game is not going to be for everyone. In my opinion there is still enough there to make the game one of the best games of its genre and time ever made. 9/10 for me
My fave game of all time.  Hands down a masterpiece and stands above most games still being made today. CDPR has raised the bar for singleplayer games, and especially when you take into account how the DLC was integrated and how good it was. I had to get the game here because I got the game for free years ago I just had to support the devs in anyway I could.
The Witcher III, my review after 55 hours of played time and finishing the main story.
I never played the first 2 parts, so i didn't knew the witcher universe, but i liked it from the start. After a bit of time getting into the mechanics and controls, the great visuals and atmosphere took over, so much that i found myself doing a lot more side quets then i usually do in an open world game.
The main story is great, good voice actors, thought ought characters and a gripping story with a nice ending.

From the technical perspective the game runs smooth and gives a lot of options to tune performance without reducing visual quality too much.

The only part which should have gotten some love is that damn horse ... sometimes it stops without reason or takes the wrong turn, good thing with fast travel you can almost walk all the time.

I would rate this game 9.5 out of 10 points.

Never played such an wonderful game...
At the moment i am reading the books to get more and more background about the story.
graphics 9/10
story 10/10
fun 9/10
Dont forget to explore every part of the maps ;)

To put it with simple words: The best Game ever made!

 Even after playing it for the 3rd time, i still find it as unique and interesting as i did the first time i played it. The story is so well made and is the perfect continuation of Sapkowski's novels. After reading all of the books, i must say CDPR did a fantastic job at recreating the world and its characters! 
 
The graphics are beautiful. The amount of detail on the characters blows my mind to this day.

9.95/10 because there is always room for improvement, like making Geralt's feet a little stronger cuz this man cannot survive a 5 foot fall without dying..

Thank you CDPR for creating this masterpiece.
 Also, Yennefer.. she is the best!
By far one of the best games i've ever played, if not the best. Even if I cant run it at full graphics, CD Projekt Red still did this game justice. Didn't quite like it when I first played in on the PS4, but i didnt know what i was doing then. Rebought it cos i wanted to finish it, and I went onto play it 4 more times. played all the DLC's with it. You always find something new that you didn't try last time, or theres a different story path you want to take. On my latest play through I got through all the missions and all the question marks on the map. Really grindy but i thoroughly enjoyed it! It even inspired me to buy the books so I can know the story before this game! 10/10 would forget everything to redo what I did in the past
Honestly, I didn't like the 2nd game so I didn't give much thought to this one, but boy was I wrong, I love this shit, one of the best games I've ever played
For me its a 9,5/10, Its more easy talk what its bad in this game, Some annoying bugs (Like minor missions you can´t complete unless you use a previous save) Or some bugs with automatic doors, For the rest, its a perfect game.
There are many games that are good to play, but rarely will I come across a masterpiece. It's one of the few games I've played that I cannot put down. I must continue on to watch the story unfold. I've put in 77 hours so far, and I don't think I've even made a dent in it. The world is so huge. So many different paths the story goes depending on your choices in the game. This game just does it right. It took me a while to finally play The Witcher 3 and I'm glad I finally got around to it. It's so good. I haven't even finished it and I am already hoping for Witcher 4. This is the first CDPR game I've played and I am now a big fan. Looking forward to Cyberpunk 2077. I never ever buy a game without watching and reading reviews but I can bet on Cyberpunk 2077 game to be another masterpiece.

I don't think this song matches with the game too well, but it is the most fitting choice, compared with the other games in my library. The song would just not be suitable for Skyrim. When I find a suitable game, the title will be handed over.


Honestly though, the Witcher 3 is spot on with its dialogue and its story. The biggest plus for me though, is its consistency with its creature mechanics. I was bamboozled twice by wraiths in this game and in Witcher 2, because I didn't read what wraiths were known to do. The infuriating outcomes from my choices made sense, and is why I really enjoyed the series.

There are janky swimming mechanics though, and Roche is a bloody hassle to control. Gwent is okay.

This game is a very interesting game. Most people would probably endorse it because of the amazing story and interesting characters or maybe because of a detailed and beautiful world. Me however, I would like to endorse it for raising the standard when it comes RPG games. I love to mod Skyrim and I was hoping to experince the same with The Witcher 3, but I came up short since the game already essential is a complete gem. To give you my most subjective opinion I will make a pros and cons list
[h1]Pros[/h1]
Good Graphics
Beautiful enviroments
Interesting Characters
Fun combat
Many quests
[h1]Cons[/h1]
In some ways the main story is to long to keep interesting (for me)
Side quests isnt rewarding in form of loot or exp (except a good time)



So.... let´s make it short.

A true slav game.

[b] If you didn´t play this masterpiece you don´t know shit about RPG. [/b]

Don´t even dare to compare this [b] art [/b] with Skyrim&Co.
Skyrim is smoking nerviosly in the corner when Witcher 3 comes around.

Also....if you want to better understand the story you should play Witcher 2.
Witcher 1 is not that important.
This is the certainly the best game I've ever played and I honestly do not think many games today even come close considering it's almost 3 years old now. But I think what I have to say has been said already - amazing graphics, unparalled storyline and such a wide variety of things to do and figure out. I loved the decision making aspects of the game which was never really a yes/no type but more of choosing the lesser of 2 evils. Highly recommend everyone to just buy this game already (plus the DLC - oh man, the DLC is so good) and you'll not be disappointed. Just finished my first playthrough and the HoS dlc and about to start B&W soon. Can't wait to play it all over again sometime. 

10/10 everything.
Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is a masterpiece. It is without a doubt the best RPG I have ever played. 

One of the best bits of the game is it’s story. It has one thing that I find many RPGs to be lacking, and that is a compelling, and most importantly emotionally investing story. You feel the impact of every decision, and you regret the outcomes of your mistakes. The side quest are where this philosophy really comes out, with not a single quest that doesn’t have some unexpected outcome, or emotionally investing decision to make. 

The game is also still tremendously nice to look at, even now in 2019. While the water effects and animations are starting to show their age, the textures are still at a higher resolution and look then games that came out even this year. Not to mention the fact that this game has a whole host of mods to improve its visual capabilities.

The final thing to consider with this game is the amount of gameplay this game has available. It has interesting combat, and even a separate game within the game. This game is an easy 100-200 hour experience, and the price doesn’t do it justice. Bravo CD Projekt Red, Bravo
I've picked the game up during a Christmas sale because I've heard great things about it and I've been totally blown away. I don't tend to play RPGs or singleplayer games in general but the Witcher is a huge expection. The game is extremely captivating and I loved every hour I've put into this game. 

The story is fantastic, the whole fandom is great (based on Sapkowski's books) and the gameplay/mechanics are amazing aswell. This game is easily over 100 hours of gameplay if you dive into it and do all of the sidequests and take your time with it, it's not a speedrun, remember. 

The story isn't linear but also isn't completely up to the player. It starts the same and has over 3 different endings but all of the dialogue and your actions inbetween have a big impact. This game doesn't forgive and it definitely doesn't forget. Another great aspects are the DLCs which both offer at least 15 hours of gameplay each, all-new characters and a new map. 

TL;DR: In my honest opinion this is the best RPG made by far.
Witcher 3 huh.... It has been quite a ride. Bought it since I needed a new game to play and it was on sale. And honestly I wasn't that hyped to play it. I didn't see it as a very interesting game.

Long story short, my first impression of the game was like this - huh cool; mehhhh; not bad; mehhhh. Why is that you might ask? Hear me out.

Well to give more context, I bought Witcher 3 after I completed Dark Souls 3 and by completed I mean getting every single achievement. So I do have some experience in playing hard games and bla bla bla, but the thing about Witcher 3 was that is was like ultra hard af. Monsters literally one/two shot you and your shield ability also absorbs only one hit. At the beginning I found that extremely frustrating. I was literally thinking "this game is freaking 5 time harder than Dark Souls wtf". Now still to this very moment I don't know if that was because I chose hard diff or is it similiar to other diff as well. I mean to be fair there was even harder diff than "hard", so I am lost for words. 

I also really felt uncomfortable with the controls/mechanics, they felt really... I can't even put it to words, but the way I played in Dark Souls 3 it felt really balanced and comfortable, as where in Witcher 3 it was just unpleasant, but hey I think that's just me!

Moving on, to the good stuff - Story is beautiful, the world itself is huge and pretty, all the quests have some sort of side story which you don't see in other games. DLC's are very rewarding: giving extra "powering up" potential with new upgrades and etc. but most importantly - MORE GREAT STORY. 

Besides all the good stuff, I want to point out some things after fully finishing the game. Bad ones to be specific.

Horses...... My holy mother of jesus. I have never seen such chaotic and MOST annoying horse riding mechanics in my life. Like seriously. And the thing is with a world this size, you use your horse like 80% of the time. I would want to brag about horse mechanics for an hour to someone and have them comfort me later. 

To put it simply, your horse is like the biggest pu**y ever. You try to make a simple turn, you have plenty of space, but your horse just stops in the middle of the turn, you sprint in a straight line, somehow it gets disturbed by fence which is like half a meter away. The delay between jump is like solid 1.5sec like wtf. Also it doesn't even jump sometimes at all. And the list goes on... 

SO GLAD I don't have to mess with him anymore. Oh and btw, summoning of the horse is also stupid. For a person like me who is "Call, Jump on, Sprint" type, basically I don't want to spend 10 seconds every single time just to get on him, 'cause the way it is now is - Call him, he spawn always behind you, which means the opposite direction you want to go + spawns about 15~ meters away + moves like the slowest ass in the world. That's just frustrating.

Just like the horse, swimming mechanics were also terrible, but I mainly felt it just as very irresponsible, they worked something like this - You press one button, it activates a certain animation.  So in a long run its not terrible, but when you have to maneuvere in small areas it was a pain in the ass.

Welp, I think I got most of what I wanted to say about this game.

Just as a note, so glad I got Blood and Wine DLC, just because I could see [spoiler]Ciri[/spoiler] again. 

To sum up, this game definitely has a lot in store so definitely give it a shot, but be aware of some REALLY annoying mech's 'cause believe me, they will haunt you forever.

I so rarely write reviews, but 150 hours later and I figured this game deserved the highest praise I could give it. Seriously, this is by far and away my favorite game I've ever played and I cannot sing its praises enough as it is a work of art. From now on, this will be the standard that I judge all RPGs by (and it is an incredibly high standard to set). The world of Witcher 3 is masterfully crafted and incredibly detailed and rich. The story draws you in right from the beginning and keeps you hooked, and the beautiful, smooth gameplay and graphics keep you there. While a game like this has the potential to feel repetitive in sidequests (ex: get quest from giver, research monster, hunt monster) the writing was so good that I never felt this way at all and thoroughly enjoyed nearly every quest. The DLC's are a must buy as well (Blood and Wine has almost as much content as some standalone games!!). I will never ever forget this game and will be replaying sometime in the near future.
Okey. I have played my first RPG in the year 2002. It was Gothic 2. 
And this game here, ist the best RPG I have ever played. 
It just is. Period. 

If you do not buy this game, you are a disgrace to the human race. If you do not buy this game, your taste for good games must be so bad, you should not have internet access for national security reasons. 


I thank, CD Project Red, for the most wonderful story I had a pleasure of experiencing. 
Alas, like all stories, this one has come to an end. 

It's been a pleasure, Geralt. 
Farewell, and good luck on the Path!
watching Youtube videos doesnt do this game justice, i eventually caved because it was on sale and got the GOTY edition and my god WHAT A PRETAAY GAME!. No review can really tell you how good it is because the decisions are yours to make. You do what you want when you want, the story is amazing, the DLC adds another 50 hours of gameplay onto an already lengthy game. The amount of extra things you can can do already takes up a huge amount of time but never feels like a grind. The game naturally takes away hours of your life that you wont want back because they were spent in such a full filling world of pure amazement.  Hats off CD project red. Smashed it out the park!
EDIT 2: I've never ever seen such a great, in-game and in between scenes animations and realism; it makes other games look cartoonysh, generic and absoultelly unnatural and unrealistic on even the most "next gen" so called video games. This game deserves RTX support since it already has a great use of volumetric system for depth emulation (better than many of these "next gen" video games) and a great use of enviromental lighting effects, casting colors and reflecting on the scenario, as wel, the whole enviroment. Of course, the engine used is old, but an RTX update would make the difference even today. I fuck this game!

Btw, I use the most higher visual settings in-game and by using all the characteristics of enhacements that the nVidia Control Panel provides.

EDIT: The story is mindblowing, totally out of the box. It makes other games stories like a book for babies. The story is so sick, the game itself is a perfect mix between the outer world, with ghosts and esoteric stuff involved with very creepy rituals and then, you have any sort of human earthy stuff, fighting with bad guys or helping around, or been hired... This game is the hell of weird. Buy it.

Incredible game! It has everything that all Assassin's Creed games has and all what other games has as well so this game is full of all. If I would know this game existed, I wouldn't bought so many others. How this game was ripped by other companies is quite disgusting. I've never ever played this game but it already had all what  the new games offered as "new". Really incredible and it worths every cent. I had it in my wishlist like more than a year ago or so and never bought it because looked too RPG to me, but it's just in the right balance. 

Buy it when you want, it's really incredible, the story, the sounds, the animations, music, textures, realism at is best!

Absolutelly recommended for people who likes a great open world full of REASONABLE and LOGICAL possibilities and missions.

These guys were many years ahead when they deeveloped this game, so ahead that is at the level of any game from today.
This is the best game of all time, undoubtedly. CD Project Red made a game, which can take you into the Witcher world forever. The story, the graphics, the characters, the gameplay, the surroundings are beautiful as a dream. Thank you for creating this amazing world and I'm happy to be part of it!
Absolute recommendation. This is one of the best PC games ever made, whether you judge it by storytelling, sound and mzsic, overall world feel, graphics (which are amazing even by 2019. standards IMO), animation of characters and monsters, back story, quests and side quests, the list goes on. Every time I log on to the game, I feel like I have something to do, something I missed, some secret to find. And it always gives a special feeling. The crafting system is also a very nice additon and the set items are insanely powerful. 

There are some cons to the game, because it isn't perfect (Roach'es AI is sometimes stupid and it never spawns where you want it, Geralt can't jump in combat, along with some other quirks). Also, alchemy is not nearly as used as it could have been. It does help in certain situations, but later in the game, you feel so overpowered (because the gear is insane) that you rarely use it.

However, these are really minor things, Overall, the game is insanely good and IMO every gamer should try it at least once.

Score: 9.5/10.
What is the definition of "best of all time"?  It is when a game came out years later you still can enjoy the game to it's fullest.  As times goes by graphic can be old, performance may be out of date, but story telling will be there forever.  I’m playing Witcher 3 for the third time and I got to say it still gives me goosebumps.  
The Witcher 3 series is the Golden standard for  story telling and open world games since then.  While we anxiously waiting for The next Project red game- Cyberpunk 2077, I highly recommend to play or replay Witcher 3 the wild hunt.
The combat in the game could use more work but it's the story that makes this game special. It's a rollercoaster and I love every minute of it.

The soundtrack is top notch

Characters are loveable

2 DLC that could've been its own game!

Best game ever!
Not only the best RPG I've played so far, but the best game! Seriously tho... Don't buy if you want to have and live your life for the next months or even years. Solid 20/10
Wonderful game, open world, nice graphics, fascinating main-story, very detailed side-quests, ....!
At the beginning its quite hard, but in the end it´s too easy (even on death-march-difficulty), some scaling would´ve been nice.
The same goes for the DLCs, except for their main-stories, they are even better! After finishing both of them I was like "Holy sh*t, that was a wonderful story!" :D
Sometimes the game is a bit buggy/glitchy, but all in all I strongly recommend the game!
One of gaming's greatest achievements the world, sound, graphics, story and characters are all above reproach. The combat isn't perfect but that's the only detraction from this masterpiece 10/10
One of the best games ever made. 
had it on ps4 when it came out and i was hooked, and now that it was on sale with the dlc's its just a must.

BEST.FUCKING.GAME.EVER rip my spare time
Great gameplay, choices that have incredible sway and and bucket of content for a game half the price of most current triple A title. I highly recommend this game whether you've played the others or not. Also the amount of free DLC is refreshing.
Running around stealing bread and water off the tables of the poorest pesants in order to continue my addiction of collecting painted stones. 

Would starve villages again.
The best game I have ever played. Hands down. Probably will be for you as well. If you are still looking at the reviews and thinking on whether to buy it. Don't think twice, just get it. Btw, you need to get the DLCs. The DLCs are really on another level.
This game. Where to even begin...

I don't even write reviews!!! That's a start. But this game...this game needs - nay - deserves one! 

This game can be summed up with the following: This is the greatest game I have ever played. Period. 

The above sentence previously applied to The Last of Us by Naughty Dog, and I didn't think that I would feel that about another game any time soon. Then came the Witcher 3. But wait - plot twist - I didn't like the game the first time I played it! Thought it was average, drawn out, and nothing special.

I first bought the game for PS4 right after release in 2015, without any prior knowledge about the Witcher series. I just knew the game had a lot of hype, so I thought I'd try it out. Bad idea. Going into this masterpiece with a casual mindset was the wrong thing to do. So what happened? Was this love at first glance? No. I played for a few hours; thought to myself: "meh" and didn't play it again.

Enter 2017, the year I built my first custom PC. For some reason I had decided to enter the PC master race (must have been due to binge watching all those desk setup videos on YouTube). Anyways, I built my PC, bought all the bells and whistles and finally had a shiny new GTX 1070 to push majority of games to that crisp 1440p on my ultrawide monitor. 

As I began to peruse steam, The Witcher 3 showed up again in my queue. After seeing the 'Overwhelmingly Positive' rating I decided to actually read the reviews a little and was just blown away by the love that this game had been receiving, even well after launch. 

So I ponied up and dropped a measly $40 (feel like I robbed CD Projekt Red) or so on the GOTY edition and decided this time would be different. This time, I was going to try to absorb myself in the lore, soak in everything as much as possible and truly give it another shot.

193 hours later (at the time of this review) the rest is history. 

I have now finished all the main and side quests in the main game, as well as all things in the two 'expansion' packs (don't even get me started on these fake DLCs - they're AAA titles themselves - but that's for another time).

I've still got a few undiscovered locations in the game world to explore, but once that's done I'll have finished my path in the game. 

But am I truly finished? Does one ever truly finish admiring masterpieces like The Dark Knight? Or reading Harry Potter? or watching The Lord or The Rings or Star Wars?

Short answer - No. You simply don't. Even as I write this, I'm listening to the phenomenal sound track in the background.

This game, like any other, is not perfect. But it is damn close. 

TL;DR - Buy this game, and then maybe, just maybe, you will have lived a full life.
I wish i had never bought this game at a discounted price, feels like i have cheated on a AAA gaming studio who actually put their heart and soul on this and they deserve full credits. Absolute masterpiece <3 The story, the soundtrack, the playable content provided are all class part. Best RPG game i have played in my life so far!!!
1. Wait for enemy to swing
2. Dodge
3. Attack

Congratulations, you’ve just beaten the Witcher 3. 

I bought this game thinking it was an obvious winner, while I have great respect for CDPR for their ethics as developers, not so much for the actual game design philosophy. 

There are great efforts to distinguish types of monsters via storytelling and gameplay, you can do research which will elucidate monster weaknesses before you fight them. Which is fun until you realize everything in the game has the same attack pattern (Yes, every. Single. thing.).  Humanoids are even more of a joke, as they can be one-shot-executed or you can spam weak attacks until their guard breaks as most cannot counter. In the case that they can, see my intro.
 
I’m sure the story is captivating but it’s hard to push through the terrible combat, even if it is your cup of tea you might give up after the constant bugs disable your ability to dodge at key moments or your horse’s ability to dash, or the fact your swings have an rng element and you get killed because Geralt decided to take 5 seconds longer on that particular swing- It feels less like playing a game and I’m shouting commands at a big idiot because the response to inputs make no sense. Oh yeah, the lock-on targeting system doesn’t actually work, that’s fun too. There’s also oils which add to the combat, but I could spend pages on this, so I’ll just say it’s bad as well.

As for the world, there are insane amounts of points of interest for exploring, which would be great if the combat was functional. Also, seeing as there is still no economical method of generating thousands of unique enemies and npcs, this adds up to lots of recycled content that don’t do their job of making the world feel full.

Soundtrack is fantastic, best thing about the game. Graphics are nice and the voice acting is also good, the world looks drab at times however.

I can’t even imagine what the developers were thinking with this one, maybe cut out some of the eight million pointless filler points on the map and instead spend that time on coding decent combat and more than one enemy type. Maybe go for two, that’s twice as many. 

I earnestly hope their next title does better, because their aesthetics are fantastic, I’d love to have good gameplay go along with it as well.

I bought this game years ago, played maybe 4 hours, and couldn't get into it. Requested a refund, steam denied it, and it sat in my library. I don't often play games anymore, but I noticed it last week sitting in my library and thought "hey, I paid full price for this, it's critically acclaimed, and I never put any time into it." So I gave it a second chance. I still don't like it, and here's why. For every good thing about this game, there is a massive annoyance that comes with it. And here they are.

The world is beautiful, just looking at the art of this game I would give it a 9/10. Then you try to walk through it and get hung up and clipped by every twig sticking out of the ground. Riding your hydrophobic horse off-road? Prepare for constant clipping issues. As you explore the world, you'll also notice that basically every village and town is indistinguishable from the last. The major cities and major zones have their own looks, but the villages do not. Moreover, they all feel somehow empty to me. Worse, once you explore those cities and villages, you'll notice that, astoundingly, the developers reused character models for multiple characters--including major ones. Ciri makes an appearance in the beginning of the game as a child. Ciri's model as a child is recycled with a different hairstyle multiple times. A Nilfgaardian captain early on is part of the main quest line and cannot avoid being seen, yet the developers reused his exact model for multiple other random characters like a blacksmith you may meet in another city. This is baffling to me that a AAA game developer couldn't bother making unique models for their characters, not even those who appear briefly in the main questline.

The sound is excellent and crisp. The dialogue and performances by the voice actors is nothing short of fantastic... EXCEPT the lead character, Geralt! The peasants all have a brilliant gruff rural English accents that sound medieval and crude, the Nilfgaardians sound delightfully foreign and slightly snobbish, all of the leads have voices perfectly matching their character (all are British or non-native English speaking Euro-accents). Then Geralt is an American who sounds like Viggo Mortensen doing a bad Clint Eastwood impersonation. It gets worse... Geralt drops the subject from almost every sentence he speaks, and it sounds ridiculous. A normal person might say "I spoke to him, and he told me he wouldn't help. I can't say I blame him, so I continued anyway." Geralt says "spoke to him.... told me he wouldn't help... can't say I blame him... continued anyway...." and it just sounds like amazingly bad writing, really unnatural and affected like someone trying to sound like a badass doing... well, a bad Clint Eastwood impersonation.

The characters are really interesting, but the development of your character, Geralt, is a snooze-fest. At no point in this game did I ever care about leveling up. No items are interesting, all of the skills you gain are grindy +1% to so and so, and the casting system is the single most lackluster casting system in any game I've ever played. I don't know why it's even included.

Interesting monsters and bestiary, but trash combat system for fighting them. Every fight you will ever encounter in this game is either A) dramatically under your level so that you just click repeatedly, or B) equal or above your level which results in strike-strike-roll, strike-strike-roll, strike-strike roll, repeat until enemy is dead. EVERY fight. They tried to make Geralt a sort of specialist monster hunter who gathers information then customizes his fights to focus on the weakness of the adversary, but in practice this has minimal impact and is in the periphery of combat. Strike-strike-roll, strike-strike-roll! Every. Fight. You've got 3rd person combat like Skyrim which is dirt simple and goes more for casual fun than detailed system, then you've got For Honor 3rd person combat which is exceedingly complex and unique. The Witcher 3 feels like it wants to have a complex system that the player really needs to dig into, but it ended up just a clunky burden rather that you instead struggle to get around whenever possible.

Ridiculous alchemy system. It's basically like an MMO, you just pick certain leaves or monster body parts and combine it based on a generic pre-made formula that you've found... AND once you make the potion once, it automatically regenerates itself any time you rest, er, I mean "meditate", by using up one alcoholic beverage from your inventory. So you really only need to loot that mushroom and monster tooth once in the game. After that, it's just pointless orange glow and "press e to loot" signs popping up when you don't ever need to gather any ingredients in this game.

Lastly, the choices that define Geralt's personality in this game are very often made for you. Now, you might say "not every game has to be Fable!" Well, yes and no. This is a triple A open world RPG released in 2015. After all the Fable games, all the Elder Scrolls games, etc etc, it's sort of become industry standard that you get a say in defining who your character is. A modern open world that doesn't let you steer your character's personality in any significant way is missing something in my opinion. And to be clear, there is choice in this game, some of it relevant. But dialogue options that would define your character and should affect relationships are usually designed in such a way that you MUST choose one side. Faction war? Your side is chosen for you. Domestic dispute? Your side is chosen for you. Questionable actions from an occupying captain? Game dictates that you will respond with sarcasm and distrust and side with the peasants. This happens over and over, for the most part the game will tell YOU what your character does and feels. The only choice you get to make is how long you put up with strike-strike-roll and grinding to get that extra +1% to your quick attacks before getting bored and playing something more exciting, like, I don't know, Tetris or maybe checkers.
I have very mixed feelings about this game.

When it comes to story-telling, overall atmosphere of the game, quality of side quests and dialogue etc. this game ranks among the best RPG's ever made. These factors are very important for a quality RPG and The Witcher 3 definitely stands out compared to the shallowness of many recent titles in that genre.

On the other hand, there are many (maybe minor) issues, especially regarding gameplay, adding up so much it didn't make me enjoy the game as much as I should:

- Combat is pretty dull - basically dodge, spank and keep Quen up - and isn't helped by the fact that Gerald moves more like a ballerina rather than an actual fighter. Also, while in combat, he cannot jump at all, meaning that even the tiniest of walls becomes an insurmountable barrier, severly restricting combat movement.

- Graphics are very good indeed for a 2015 game, though not mind-blowing as many people say. Unfortunately, I seldomly get a possibility to enjoy these graphics. Why? Because it's basically night all day long and you can't see shit 50m in the distance. Why is that you might ask? Because there's almost always a storm or somesuch raging, totally obscuring everything and making it impossible to tell night from day. Until you check the clock and realize it's not 3am as you thought, but 1pm.

- I like loot. A lot. And there's tons of it in this game. But picking it up is an incredible pain in the ass in this game. It's simply absurd that you need just 1min to take out the enemies in a bandit camp, but you'll sometimes need 5+mins to gather all the loot. That's because you need to stand in some specific angle before an object in order to loot it, resulting in some more ballerina lessons before being able to pick it up.

-Other issue regarding loot: Literally everyone you meet tells you how hard life is, how their houses got robbed, that their wives got raped and their lifelihood taken away. They seem to be so accustomed to it that, despite all their never-ending complaints, you can simply walk into their house, say hi, steal everything right under their nose and walk back out. Noone cares. It would be an understatement to say that this is an immersion breaker.

Anyway, there's a lot more such examples I could give. But you got the idea and I absolutely don't wanna make it seem like I hate this game. As I said, story and setting wise, it's really up there. The devs definitely put a lot of effort and soul into this, and it shows. But I cannot deny the fact that there were many issues that bothered me, to an extent that they outshone the many positives.
I've tried and tried to get into this game, it had such great reviews. But i just ended up deleting it. Playing felt like a chore. Very repetitive quests. the world is beautiful at first but it ends up looking all the same. I can<t end up caring about anybody in the game, the interaction and dialogue didn't feel genuine. Most of all though

Geralt is a f*******g bore...
I am so disappointed in this game, got it on sale because I had fears of it being this new age bullshit cutscene monster before, tried to get into it but its dead to me now.

With the hype I thought it to be atleast decent, but it`s a chore. Cutscenes everywhere about nothing, clunky movement, bad combat, boring characters, washed out world, vast but boring, very slow progression outside of main story, holds your hand all the time, follow this dot on map and you`re good, no thinking mainstream bullshit, and believe me I`ve played alot of games, RPG`s being one of my favorites. 

I just cannot get why it is so praised. 

Peace out
After taking a few hours to look into everything and apply any needed bug fixes, etc. The game still randomly crashes and steam refuses to refund because it locked my computer up for almost 3 hours until i decided to just unplug it from the frickin wall. Very unhappy with steam and this game rn and I can't even complain because "U JUST DIDNT DO IT RIGHT THIS GAME IS GODLIKE" yeah i love it too but I can't frickin play it for more than 20 minutes at a time without it crashing on a loading screen randomly it's so stupid and i can't even get my money back from these greedy assholes at steam thanks guys 10/10 service
While being super open and throwing the player in the world without much teaching is good, I found it incredibly hard for this game to captivate me like the game I will be comparing it to, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild did. 10 hours in, I still have little to no idea what I am doing in the game, and no real reason to keep playing, having gotten through most of the Barons arc (up to where I find his daughter) which to me felt like a huge drag since it has taken so long I still find it hard for me to care about the characters in that arc or want to find them. As for the exploration, yes it is a huge world, but it's extremely boring and everywhere I go seems to have nothing that interests me besides maybe a small quest here and there or a board with more quests which are all pretty boring. Gameplay wise, the combat seemed fun, but I never understood the systems and never really wanted to or had the motivation to do so, It seemed overly complicated when using the small spells, dodging, and normal attacks worked just fine and felt pretty good. Although overall, my biggest complaint has to be how boring the main character is, Geralt, he has no personality besides being a badass that kills monsters. I couldn't care less about his character and therefore don't care about anything he has to do. When I had more fun playing as Ciri for about 15 minutes It hit me how boring and just not captivating the entire world and characters are. Overall, I don't recommend this game, instead, go play Breath of the Wild, I don't want to seem like a Nintendo fanboy who doesn't give any other games a chance, but I believe i've given this one a fair chance, and it didn't grab me anything like Breath of the Wild did, go play that game right now instead of this one.
Over the years, I've tried 3 times to get into this game and enjoy it, but I simply cannot. I'm going to uninstall it for good now.

What kills it for me are the terrible controls. Maneuvering Geralt feels immensely awkward. You get stuck at every tiny twig and corner. Combat is awful. I am unable to develop a feel for how Geralt moves and fights. Everything feels awkward to the point where it is simply not fun at all.

Assassin's Creed Odyssey is a good example for how it's done right. Your character moves like you expect. Combat feels right. It's fun to play, it's fun to fight even after 200 hours of playing.

Witcher 3 feels just weird.

I do not understand why this game is so highly rated. I'm bored after 5 hours.

The gameplay is absolute crap. Its essentially "press button to swing sword and progress the story"

I assume this game is highly rated for the storyline, but I don't play games for a storyline I play games for the GAMEPLAY. Storyline should be an added bonus.

Geralts voice doesn't match his face, sounds disjointed
Its easy to save yourself into an impossible situation forcing you to load an earlier save

Bad game, will request refund
I'm fighting against the crowd, because I do what I feel are correct, thus I'm entitled to my own opinion, and remember that.

Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Overrated beyond all other games I've seen being hyped for, never jumped on it myself. 

Witcher 3 has scenic views, good audio, fine texture quality, at the suffering of quite redundant gimmicks that are used once, as if they were used just to show off what they can develop. Xenovox, a walkie talkie like item, labeled quest item, which seem quite useful, even for the future, is completely useless after the quest for it is done, alongside it is the Magic Lamp, showing conversations of ghosts, being used twice. Redundancy further arrives when you can deny payment, and show that Witchers can have emotions, wether it's heroism, honour, or humility. This is then dropped when moved to Velen/Novigrad, and isn't really highlighted out again, except for some vague "do it for coin".

Gameplay's quite predictable, even similar to a blend of Skyrim and Dark Souls, being fluid, yet stupid. The way attacks are made by Geralt, is dancing with his swords, delaying the intentional attacks by roughly 40%, as if it were input lag. And is actually quite frustrating, but can get used to, though it dulls your skill. Gameplay variety is low, as it focuses on sword combat, signs can be used, but feels gimmicky due to  how low their intensity is from level 1 to ~25, and the crossbow is useless throughout the game, and is a glorified mini-harpoon for underwater "combat", one-shotting your enemies underwater.

Story is quite, frankly, shit paced, especially if you're doing side quests, contracts, etc. You're looking for your daughter, and there you are, exploring everything else, doing small duties, whilst Cirilla is being hunted by the Wild Hunt. Ala Fallout 4 which I find disgusting. The only griping story I found was with Bloody Baron about a certain baby. Neither the side quests aren't really  interesting as most of them require you to use Witcher Sense for most, if not all side quests, as if it were a fetch quest turned into kill quest with mediocre combat gameplay loop.

Skill system is minimal, leaving specific builds at most, leaving you with what others will most likely play. Healing system is especially bad during the beginning, foods healing 50 health per second for 5 seconds, while you start out with 3500 health, and it's quite easy to die early on. To counter this you can get "Gourmet", taking a whole skill slot, and you have 12 in total, and the perk itself makes food useful, but too useful, making them from 5 seconds to 20 minutes. Most skills are minimalistic, too, as if they were not supposed to make the game feel unbalanced, but gets quite to be a chore.

The enviroment is honestly just boring, Velen is just a swamp land, with a fitting meme which is Shrek, and I do not meme reviews. This alongside Novigrad is where you will spend most of the time, where Novigrad mostly consist of the city and farmlands, both lands take place in one map. The next map that takes place is Skellige, multiple isles, which in itself beautiful, but annoying with how hilly they are, and how spread they are. With these isles spread throughout, there's more water, and undiscovered locations in the ocean, where most of them are underwater, and aforementioned underwater combat is just a tank vs paper planes in short.

To conclude it... I really have to say that Witcher 3 sets no new standards, it's done the same work as other similar open world RPGs, and most decisions are meaningless, apart from the main quest decisions, making the game mostly a grey choices or just straighout pointless. 

At best, I see Witcher 3 having a score of 7 and least at 5, as I see no point of doing the same combat throughout roughly 90 hours of the game, and an additional 80  hours to the expansion. As the gameplay loop never actually branches out, and if you think the combat branches out, there's a good game that actually makes combat branching, which is Divinity Original Sin utilizing more of the enviroment, weapons, scrolls, etc. for you to use. 

Witcher 3 just has so much redundancy and focus on graphics, that it's basically just another triple A game with the focus on textures, and not on gameplay, and not on the story as it's just another parent after "adopted" daughter story. And frankly, I think the expansion is quite worthless, and I've spent 4 digit hours on Warframe, and still get more fun, and even more story on that, whilst not even interested in Warframe's story. 

TL;DR: Either I'm a prick, or I critize the game harsher because of it being overrated beyond any game I've seen being overrated.
I wanna say this is an amazing game. I have a hard time getting into anything that isn't survival open world where I make my own story with real people. So when I say I was able to get into this and have it keep pulling me back i'm not joking its amazing. However let me get to the one point which broke my entire experience and makes me not wanna look at it anymore. 

Weight!!!!!!! At some point during my play through a glitch happened I guess that now puts me at 60/90 weight no matter what I have on me. The game is unplayable at this point unless you only like carrying 3 swords and maybe some chest armour before I have to back to sell or drop things. Even changing my saddle bags does nothing for me! I can't seem to find any fix for this online just people complaining about all kinds of glitches related and unrelated to this. Makes me really disappointed in this game and the dev's!!!!

PLEASE FIX WEIGHT GLITCH SO I CAN GIVE POSITIVE REVIEW!!!
The game feels so packed with just random benign quests and side quests that you forget what you were even trying to accomplish. The main character, Geralt, is basic and boring and I just couldn't seem to care about his backstory or anything else to do with him. He feels like everything a 7 year old boy would want to be when he grows up. The women want him; the men want to be him.

The map is huge and they did well to make the cities and towns unique but it wasn't enough for me to actually really care about what environment I was in.

I'm not sure where in the game I got to in terms of how close I was to completing my ?main? goal but I think there was probably a lot more to go. I bought the GOTY edition whilst on sale so I got all the DLC's although I don't think I actually played any them.

The graphics are good and the combat is decent and it was fun for a while but you just go back and forth between multiple people to try to progress the main quests. Playing this after the first 15 hours just began to felt like a chore with nothing ever seeming to advance the story and I quickly lost interest in the game after that.

I wish there was a neutral option however for full price I would not recommend this game as it just becomes stale so quickly.
I don't know why everyone thinks so highly of this game. If you are like me and love open world RPG's like Oblivion, Skyrim, or even the fantastic Kingdom Come: Deliverance, don't buy this game. 

It
is
SO.
BORING.

I really wish I could enjoy it but I just can't and if a game can't give that to me in 18 hours of playtime it isn't fun.
Some of the areas in this game are really well designed and the story is quite interesting even if predictable. Unfortunately there are then other areas in the game which feel at times like so little thought and effort went into the design of them it really ruins the pace of the game at times, and it's enough to stop me from wanting to play on.
One of the most overrated games in the past few years: Combat is very repetitive after a while, all builds are pidgeon-holed to a set appropriate to them, sex-scenes are same with different female model and one has to really pay attention to his / her choices if the goal is 100% achievement. 

Many missions also have choices where one is "correct" and anything else gives no reward like one quest where correcting that the dragon was in fact wyvern. There are many plotholes and situations where axii would be practical but for whatever reason Geralt forgets to utilize the sign.

I'll give the game credits for few things: Gwent is good, main story is alright and major characters aren't forgetful. The game is worth it for the story after it gets a discount.

This is the only Witcher game I couldn't bring myself to finish due to how boring it was. There's a lot of repetitive content.
if you are a fan of the series (somehow) it's definitely a buy. If you didn't enjoyed previous titles, don't bother (i don't know why i did). It's a glorified mediocre game. I feel like i'm being choked while trying to play this game. It's putting pressure on me, it's like the crazy SO you have, that is beating you, talking about how everyone likes him/her and why can't you be just like them, that you need to love them, but sorry game, i can't, i try, i really try, but i just can't. It just doesn't work.
What a load of hype for a mediocre experience! I do not see why people like this game so much. 

Gameplay/controls: movement/actions are delayed and like the worst of GTA. , The game is unnessecary complicated with it's crafting system and inventory. You'll find you'rself jumping in and out the inventory and menu diving  A LOT.  Played with a XBOX One controller, by the way.

Combat: The worst. Doesn't feel fun at all to swing the sword around or cast spells, You'l basically be rolling around a lot back and forth and perhaps getting yourself or the camera stuck. 

Graphics: They're OK but coming from games like Hellblade and Tomb Raider, they aren't even that impressive. 

Music: Got pretty annoying/repetitive fast and i turned it off.

Story: Yeah this seems allright. Progressing the main story seems the only real way to gain any XP, such party poopers. Why can't i wield some kind of sword beyond my level, when i found it , where's the fun in that!?
The most overrated game of all time. The characters and plot are generic. Geralt is just a tough gruff man with a deep voice and scars banging his way through hundreds of women and millions of monsters. The graphics are decent, the enemies are a good balance but the combat system is painful. The controls aren't smooth and the combat feels like I have no idea if I'm actually doing damage or how to dodge their attacks. The game is good, it's well main, the animations are amazing. But overall I got bored very quickly.
The more I played, the worse it got...

At first, I enjoyed playing, the griffin fight was fun, the locations were exciting but after 2 hours, I was so done. How many cut scenes can you fit in one game??? Half of them are irrelevant! So much time wasted in cut scenes, tried to stream it multiple times but it was just so boring! The combat is also terrible, no matter how hard you hit an enemy, they still break your combo without flinching and the weapons feel like they are made of paper! The controls are just trash on both controller and keyboard, everything is so spread out I end up pressing several random buttons just to remember where the 'cast spell' key is. Overall, don't bother unless it's on sale for about a fiver and you have nothing to do for the next several years.

Also worth noting, about 40% of my experience playing this was in loading screens, 35% in cut scenes and the last 25% is actual gameplay...

To sum it all up

Pros
-Good Idea

Cons
-Poor Execution
game is way overrated.

combat is trash. too many random useless map points. most items feel completely useless. stat and gearing system doesnt make any sense. youll be wearing some garbage piece of gear and earn a legendary piece from a hard quest and it wont be nearly as good. 

i dont know why so many people like this. play a real RPG
Played on keyboard and mouse.

You and your horse get stuck in the ground a lot. Impossible to run away from minor enemies on your horse or dodge their attack if on person.

The game chooses for you what sword to use, even if sub-optimal. Before a fight begins, the buttons for selecting the sword you want do not work so you are forced to use whatever sword the game chose for you to use.

This game is unplayable. How did this win GOTY?
I bought this game thinking it would be good; not the case. 

This is how my experience went:

1. Instantly Geralt (Main character) comes across like a beta cuck being told what to do by his partner. 
2. The other characters were lame. 
3. The gameplay / tutorial training felt clunky. 
4. I got on a horse after a discussion about a dream the main character had. 
5. I exited the game; the horse was terrible to control. 

Very poor 1st impression, not what I expected Witcher 3 to be.
Is this another bullshit game made by Naughty Dog? I thought Geralt should be a witcher that could use a simple spell or someone who could normally smash to break a fvking locked wooden door!  Poor witcher, he could not even jump though a low wall which human kids could easily do. Fk you,I ran out of patience finding ways to everywhere, why do I have to do this? Seeking paths in the dark with a damn torch, what do you want? Turning everybody blind? Go to hell with your stupid game.
1 word - horrible. Probably the worst game I have ever played. How this shit can have such a positive reviews ??! Graphics looks like from a 2004 game, storytelling is next level ''bleh'', voice acting is like from original Resident evil series back in 90s, which was a disaster, but at least Resident evil games had a great gameplay, controls in this Witcher the wild cu nt is a disaster. 

Overwhelmingly positive ??!! You meant overwhelmingly sh it af. Im not surprised since polish devs kurwas are behind this game, cyber punk 2077 is screwed.
over rated its like everyone just playing this for the story because the open world is an open world once you get to a high point in the story and the story is not good its trying to be a movie but its not doing this good red dead 2 did it good and i spent 100+ hrs on red dead 2 on my xbox. listen this game is over hyped if you dont have skyrim an the witcher 3 buy skyrim.
