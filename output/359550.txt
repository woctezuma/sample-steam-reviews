Hi there, I am a Chinese player. I am writing this comment in English because I just want to explain what is going on with R6 these days in China and why Ubisoft is receiving an increasing number of bad comments from Chinese players out of sudden. Of course, what I am going to say is based on my recognition and understanding. I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.

For the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by “Fatty G”(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.

First, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent’s most famous products. (For you guys who don’t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I’d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.

There are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)…As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word “most”, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what’s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.

The second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they’ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You’ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.

And now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don’t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.

Thanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English. If you have any questions or different views or want to make some corrections, please feel free to discuss.
[b]24/02/2019 - My review is entirely obsolete due to them removing the starter edition.  They've also changed the prices of the operators, making them more cheaper so hooray![/b]

[h1][b]This is for the people who brought the starter edition... [spoiler]like me.[/spoiler][/b][/h1]

If you brought the starter edition, your best option would be to pick 10 operators since base game operators cost 12,500 renown each.  So 5 operators each for attacking and defending and the 10 that I'm about to list are possibly your best bet to having the best experience in Rainbow Six Siege.

[h1][u]For the attacking team[/u][/h1] 
[list]
[*][b]Sledge[/b] - If you are absolutely new to the game and you don't know where to start, Sledge is one of the best options to choose from. He isn't a hard operator to play with (Considering his name, you should know why...) and the team doesn't rely too heavily on his gadget.  
[*][b]Thermite[/b] - One of the best operators in the game because of how good his rifle is with low recoil and high damage.  His gadget is also one of the most useful in the game especially for creating a [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/oB-9j98APlM?t=1m8s]BIG FUCKING HOLE[/url][/spoiler] on reinforced walls.  Though, to create that hole, you have to make sure you stay alive, the team relies heavily on him to get into the objective but if it's jammed or electrified...
[*][b]Thatcher[/b] -  Thatcher is your main man.  One of the biggest problems you'll face as a Thermite are Mute's and Bandit's gadgets which jam or electrify reinforced walls.  With Thatcher, all you have to do is throw your EMP grenades and no more [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/NPucxmxW5eM]FOOKIN' LASER SIGHTS.[/url][/spoiler]
[*][b]Ash[/b] - She's one of the fastest operators in the game and literally has no hitbox.  Her gadget is breaching things from afar, pretty much a breaching grenade laucher which sticks into any surface.  Just remember that you'll be called a sweaty try hard from time to time...
[*][b]Twitch[/b] - Now this may be a controversial pick since her drone is about to get nerf'd but her rifle is what keeps her on this list.  Her ability isn't that special, basically a drone that can't jump but can shock people and destroy their gadgets.  However, her F2, a variant of the Famas, shoots around 980 RPM and it's possibly one of the most deadliest assault rifles in the game.[/list]

[h1][u]And now, for the defending team[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*][url=https://youtu.be/F-6ZkbVpTcU][b]Rook[/b][/url] - He's one of the easiest operators to play and helps the team just by dropping a pack of armor.  That's all you have to do and you get to survive one extra bullet and will mostly be put in the DBNO stage instead of death.  The only thing you have to remember is to make sure you drop armor in the beginning of the round which a lot of people forget...
[*][b]Bandit[/b] - Bandit's gadget is pretty simple to use as long as you use it on reinforced walls since his gadget is the only one that can destroy Thermite and Hibana's charges on contact.  Also, his MP7 is known as a god tier gun, being incredibly easy to use.  [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/hkLUOuE_-5I]Did I also mention he had to deal [b]DRUGS?[/b][/url][/spoiler]
[*][b]Jager[/b] - Aka the ultra sweaty try hard main.   To be honest though, there is a good reason why people main this guy and that's because of how good he is.  His gagdet may not be that useful at times, having the ability to destroy any type of throwable but I like to call it wishful thinking.  Another thing to help him is that he's currently the only defender with an assault rifle so he gets to do more damage than most defenders which only carry SMGs.  
[*][b]Smoke[/b] - He's simple but somewhat hard to use.  See an enemy trying to get in?  Block him out with gas.  That's why he's called Smoke.  He excels during the last few seconds of a round when enemies are desperately rushing in.  [spoiler][b][url=https://youtu.be/8MHk0WwrzgY]WHAT'S IN THE CANISTER?[/url][/b][/spoiler]
[*][b]Mute[/b] - He almost works in the same way as Bandit but his gadget has a radius meaning he can block off a Thermite's breaching charges on two walls.  He also has the ability to place his jammers anywhere where as Bandit can only place his on shields, barbed wire, and reinforced walls.  He is one of the harder operators to play if you don't use him correctly so I'd recommend learning him soon.  [/list]

[h1][u]Honorable Mentions[/u][/h1]
[list]
[*][b]Hibana[/b] - She's an attacker who serves as an alternative to Thermite.  Her gadget is a mix between Ash and Thermite, being able to shoot out 6 pellets and burn through reinforced walls.  She's a flexible operator and her ability can be amazing at times.  She's a DLC character so she will cost 25,000 renown.  [/list]

[h1]So do I recommend the game?[/h1]

[b]Absolutely.[/b]  Even if you buy the starter edition, all it really means is that it will take more time and patience.  Siege has a huge learning curve but once you get through it, you will be hooked.  I hope this review helped, took me a while but I just wanted to share my thoughts.
Siege is by far my favorite shooter. It's not even close. This is an incredibly difficult game for an FPS, but the payoff is well worth it. At about 100-150 hours of play I felt like I generally understood all the maps, the tactics and meta for each, and the play mechanics; at about that point it starts to become an FPS that makes all others obsolete. I completely understand that the grind time is a huge barrier to entry, so here are some suggestions to speed it up:
1. Study the maps as much as possible and know the layout, player spawn locations, objective spawn locations, and the locations of destructible surfaces. Obviously this will come with experience, but you'll get a massive head start by memorizing this early.
2. Change your expectations; this is not anything like CoD or Battlefield. You might not get a kill for the first 10 hours of play. You might not have a positive KDR for 50 hours. You might not get MVP until 100. All of this is fine, because this is a **hard** shooter. Expect that you're going to perform awfully for a while, but that it's going to feel really, really, really good when you start hitting your milestones.
3. This is a teamwork-based game. Use a microphone if at all possible, or at least type in chat, and communicate with your team. If you're dead, watch cameras and call out positions to your team. This also helps you learn the names of the rooms and gets you accustomed to the routes players will typically take.
4. Pick operators you actually like playing. Don't just follow online guides' suggestions on which operators to unlock--read about and watch footage of operators and pick the ones you're excited about. Just want to play the starters? That's totally fine, Thatcher and Jager are two of my absolute favorites. If you stick to ones you enjoy, you'll enjoy the game that much more.

On the flip side, the community is not great. There are a lot of toxic players who can't handle loss, have no patience for new players, or just want to make someone's day suck. Don't let them get to you and use the voice/text chat mute features as much as you need. If they're getting really out of hand then just report them.
The Renown system (the currency you buy operators with) accrues really slowly, so if you're okay with in-game purchases, buying some Renown to get some operators more quickly might help. Personally, I think forcing myself to play my new operators until I'm able to unlock a new one helps me get proficient all my unlocked ones, but that's my opinion.
The ranked system isn't perfect, but it's a cool way to take the experience up a notch when you get pretty good at the game. Don't stress out about it too much, plenty of players only play casual.

This really is a fantastic game when you put the time into it, and it's up to you if that's an investment you want to make. As long as you understand that it can be a grueling process in the beginning, potentially 100 hours until you're proficient, and that the community can be exhausting, I say take the leap.
EDIT: The "Starter Edition" mentioned in this review was temporary and no longer exists. My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.

I'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:

The Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between "starter players" and "regular players" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else. 

To explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are "free" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal. 

Everything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this "grinding" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like "grinding" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.

If there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an "on sale" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The "grinding" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator "on sale" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.

That should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.

I want to address the issue of the "full price for only multiplayer" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a "campaign"; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 "situations", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a "lone wolf" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.

Why would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The "time to die" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.

It might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.

The port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.

This is also the first time that I've had to "deal with" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.

So that was a shitload of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into. Can't wait to put in even more hours.
[h1][Description][/h1]
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a first-person multiplayer shooter that borrows from Counter Strike and hero shooters, mixing it together into a tactical, objective-based shootout where movement is slow and combat is fast. The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.
 
[h1][Pros][/h1]
+ Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets.
+ No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game’s release.
+ Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far
+ Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior.
+ Pleasing graphics that look great and don’t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher.
+ A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency.
+ You just can’t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players.
+ Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits.
+ Maps are free for everyone, it doesn’t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together.
+ Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones.
+ Music is fitting the game’s tone very well you just don’t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.

[h1][Cons][/h1]
- Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future)
- Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity.
- Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode.
- Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.
 
[h1][Conclusion][/h1]
While this iteration of the series is vastly different than it’s predecessors, I think it’s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.

p.s. not to be a click whore or anything but my friend Kimchi Mods on Youtube and Twitch is starting out and he makes good content, if u like the review pls check him out
Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!

I was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.

Year 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018

===================================================

Rainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.

People compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them. 

CSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)

Now that you have a "general" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).

=====================================

Toxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.

Teamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.

Cheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might "think" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.

Pay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.

Teamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to "check" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.

Spawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best "peaking" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions. 

Running Outside To kill ------ Another "Game Knowledge" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that "CRASH" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!

============================

I removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!

Update on January 3rd:

Here we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:

We've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016. 

We've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.

Zofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the "Ash 2.0" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/) 

Vigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's "in that room" but not "where in that room" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.

Apparently, Ubisoft is working on something called "Operation Outbreak"....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.

Ubisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.

Tachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios. His main problem being no mobility when on his turret. This should be assumed that Tachanka would be able to defend this position quite easily on his turret, but alas, there are still some things that need to be done to solidify the anchor role for him.

That's it for the January 2018!

============================

I hope you have a better idea of the game, its pros and cons, and perhaps I'll see you in Ranked someday!

If you want me to answer some questions, feel free to leave a comment.
Tutorial if you want to buy a diffrent version of the game (like if you can get complete but you cant because you bought starter)

1- Go to help in the top left of your screen

2- click steam support

3- click on rainbow or search it 

4- "permanantly remove this game from my account"

5- you can now buy complete, advanced, etc

oh also the game is good
game is fun to play but there is one minus for those who buy ranbow six siege: starter edition the prices are so high and for you to unlock one operator you will need to spend atleast 12500 points it's around 16-20hrs 
and other thing i don't like that you can't buy full game after you bought starter edition
they should add that.
And from my point of view they would make more money people would be like this 

hey i wanna try this game *buys  Rainbow Six Siege: Starter Edition for 14.99eur*
Hey this game is actually fun *buys full edition of the game for 29.99*
They would make 5eur per person who would do that so i don't understand why not add this option
A.) I love this game, I have a lot of fun playing this game. I recomond it.

B.) My main point, this game has gotten a review bomb of thousands of negetive reveiws due to Operation Censorship. If you don't know what this is, Ubisoft made a desision to censor many things like blood, slot machines, the stripper neon sign, and many things like that. They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion. If you are reading this and you wrote a negetive review purly because of this, please take it down now that operation censorship has been cancelled.
Step 1: Pick Fuze
Step 2: Place cluster charge onto hostage room door
Step 3: Prepare to make Mother Russia proud as you detonate the charge
Step 4: kill all 11 players including yourself and the hostage
Step 5: Bask in your glorious victory
> Play as French guy with giant shield
> Storm a room filled with 4 enemies
> Cant do anything but blocking bullets
> Died eventually
> Team lost the round 
> I apologized 
> Was expecting insults and yells but they instead said to me "Hey, nice cover, sorry we lost"

10/10, hope the community stays that way
This game is fun if you're into competitive and fps games. Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.

UPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators)  for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)

Summary: good game boys
Threw a frag because I'm still a noob
"Hey man, let's take it easy with the nades"
"Sorry"
"Alright, can you try and flank? I'll ping where you need to go"
"Sure"

Coming from CSGO, this is a breath of fresh air

Edit: CSGo's less popular cousin but way more chill and fun to hang out with.
Accidentally pressed "G" and tossed a grenade into a wall which promptly landed at the bottom of my team-mates feet and detonated.

Guy: "Hey man can we take it easy on the grenades?"

After playing CS:GO I didnt expect that reaction

I immediately apologized and we continued

10/10 best community in a game

Edit : This review was written waaaay back around when the game first released, and I'll admit the times were a lot better back then community wise. I decided to update my review in response to the recent comments on it, and how I agree/disagree with them.

As with any increasingly popular shooter, the community won't always be the best. Before the game really exploded a year or so ago the community seemed pretty great, a very different feeling from CS:GO's community and COD's. It seemed like everyone playing Siege WANTED to have a very tactical shooter experience. It seems to me now that a lot of people don't really play Siege for that reason anymore. Though of course with the games growing player count, multiple sales and their ESL league it seems to have brought in a lot of the toxcicity from other shooter games. 

With my recent experience of the game I've noticed a lot of leavers and teamkillers in Casual. Ranked not so much, but I noticed that there are so many people who will leave a match after losing the first round of a game. I've had people TK multiple teammates because they were accidentally TK'd in the previous round, and a lot of players bashing on people who are new to the game.

Despite these issues, the game still comes out as my favorite competitive shooters in my game library, and I still keep my thumbs up for the game because the community doesn't completely ruin it for me. I'm guessing around 75/85% of the time you'll be qeued with a compitent team that's willing to cooperate and coordinate to make a really fun match. It is by far one of the least toxic communites. And although it does have its toxic people, it's easily dismissable because of how fun the game really is, and how much it has grown and changed for the better since its release.
I am not sure if you noticed, but I don't play multiplayer first person shooters at all. With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?

Well I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.

After unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.

Where did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill. 

The game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.

As for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did. 

So in other words, I highly recommend it. Coming from someone who does not like multiplayer first person shooters, I think that is saying a lot
Like Counterstrike and Battlefield had a child that was raised by Payday and put on steroids by insurgency...

Pros:

Very well rounded game.
Runs very smoothly/very well optimised.
Rounds are short and snappy.
No two matches are ever the same.
Extremely tactical.
Excellent destruction "Realistic".
Intuitive controls.
Completely unforgiving.
Tailored for all skill levels.
Great graphics (if you turn off post processing effects).
Great community.
Great Gunplay.
Realistic health, a like two shots an you are dead.
Belivable setting, no high concept rubbish.
Very, very good tutorials.
The best interactivity I have ever seen in an FPS.

Cons:
Aim assist is on by default, why do we even need this...we are the master race after all. (Only with controllers). AIM ASSIST IS ONLY FOR CO OP AGAINST AI. (Terrorist mode).
Some collision problems with some of the maps.
Price.


All in all a very, very good game. Has the be the best tactical shooter I have ever played. HOWEVER I would warn anyone looking to pick this up, it is hard...if you are not prepared to play properly and just run around, you will die constantly and you will not enjoy it.

Honestly 8.5/10 (and thats being conservative).
Quite literally had a guy on my team named Koolaid Man and the only character he played as was Thermite. 

He proceeded to scream into his microphone "OOOOOHHHH YEEAAAAAAH" everytime he breached.

this was the best match I've ever played in any multiplayer game.

12/10

Update: found him and befriended him, we are now the sledge/thermite koolaid tag team. Enemies beware.

You will be cold and alone inside the objective
You will suddenly be subjected to the defening cacophony of doors, windows, walls, ceilings and floors explode together and in rapid succesion
You will cower in the one corner where LoS hasn't been broken
You will pop your head up in hopes of one kill before death
You will, somehow, see that all the enemy team are looking the other way
You will know what you must do
You will, instead of what any sane, reasonable man would do, you gracefully toss your nitro cell right in the midst of them
You will detonate said nitro, and get a 6 player multikill (5+1 hostage)
You will loose the round, but it will be all worth it


Pros:

- Rewards tactical gameplay
- Really hard
- No health regeneration
- Great map design
- Good graphics
- Gunplay is smooth and responsive
- AI is well designed
- Terrorist hunt is INSANE
- Well optimized

Cons:

This game is quite different from other multiplayer games. It is a 5v5 tactical FPS, with intense close quarters combat. Urging tactical decision making to experience fierce firefights and explosive action at every moment. The amazing level of destruction and gadgetry always keeps the game in motion, intense and dynamic. Every destruction could change the pace of the game which brings in a new level of playing; opening line of sights, using the destruction to your advantage and a fun strategic approach. You can coordinate with your team to alter the environment into a defensive/offensive stronghold, trap fortify and breach to progress through the environment to complete the set objective. You will be able to barricade doorways, reinforce walls, rappel and more to plan attacks. There are many operators for the attacking and defending side each equipped with their own unique ability to use in the game. A diverse choice of weapons and gadgets accross the operators really challenges the style of play. You are able to equip skins for both characters and weapons. Also, a variety of attachments are available for each weapon. All operators have the ability to reinforce, barricade and use drones for setting up.

Ubisoft is always adding new operators which are great, always trying to improve the user experience. For me personally, I have not encountered any major problems with this game, it runs smooth, connections seem to be good and overall experience is great. New maps and also changes to the current maps keeps this game going. 

In game currency (Renown) is great you can just about get everything without using real money to get skins and operators. All operators are available to purchase with renown so you don’t have to buy the season pass, the only downfall is that it’s quite expensive and does take some grinding to get enough renown.

Have not touched competitive, just offers ranks and badge to show your skill level, which I am not too bothered about.

There is a singleplayer mode called terrorist hunt which you can play with friends, essentially the main game with bots, just to practice and have fun. It offers challenges to complete and test different play styles.

Reversed censorship, major +

Some operators do need tweaking as they are OP in some areas, not really any meta at this stage of the game. Other than that is a great tactical FPS to play with friends or alone.

Overall 9/10. ACOG, just use ACOG.
Since Aug 2016 the game is more or less good. 
Before that it was just a russian roulette if you will get matched against cheaters. Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).

It happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides "scrеw that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing.
But it's all now in the past, thankfully.

It's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.

Right now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.

Pros:
- since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience;
- every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy;
- balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable;
- every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage;
- a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying);
- there's always a chance to win even when you think "it's gg". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.

Neutral:
- 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death;
- 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira);
- only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).

Cons:
- ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage;
- netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it;
- peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP;
- bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating;
- bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with);
- if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.

This game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.

Recommended to play with 3 or 4 friends. Info and communication mean a lot here.

#ashkicksasses
I have Rainbow 6 Siege on Xbox One, and I played the free weekend on Steam. Here's my experience.


Xbox:

*Accidentally shoots teammate*
"KID WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING YOU FUCKING IDIOT FUCKING GO PLAY CASUAL YOU FUCKING DUMBASS"

PC:
*Accidentally shoots teammate*
"Sorry bro my bad."
*Played my first casual match, I didn't know how to get around the map*

- Sorry guy's I'm new, I don't know what I'm doing.
- It's okay, don't worry about it.

10/10
After almost 1300 hours of play, and a love/hate relationship, I can confirm the game is good, aslong as you play the game in 1-2 hour bursts. When playing longer than that at one time, salt starts flowing faster and you get extremely toxic. Would recommend.
after 600+ hours in this game my tactics are:

-Spray in the area of the head and hope for a headshot
-Blow anything up that is destructable
-Hate on ela
-use guns with a very high fire rate only
-Get deranked 6 times a day 
-Get promoted 5 times a day

DON'T buy Starter Edition, because you'll be limit in a lot of ways, like everything costs twice and more information you can find here: https://support.ubi.com/en-GB/faqs/000025116/Starter-Edition-FAQ

Let's go with the review... hmm??
So after 3000 hours+ on CS:GO I needed to change the game with something different and here we go I'm already IN LOVE in R6S. It's great tactical competitive, ranked, team-effort type of game. It has variety of operators to play and choose from, each with an own unique trait, ability for your play style. You can read more about operators on the website of Ubi.
You need to watch lots of guides for operators, weapons, maps and to play at least 50 hours+ to get used to the mechanics of the game, maps, weapons, recoils, etc. At the begging you'll be a little bit confused what to do, where to reinforce, how to position yourself, how to peak, move, etc. That's why I recommend to go thru "Situations" first and then choose your operators and play casual. You need to get to level 20 to play ranked and personally I think they need to change it - let's say 50-60 level, maybe? Getting to level 20 is easy, but you're still learning the game mechanics. 
Another important thing is that you don't need to pay for operators - If you play you earn renown and you can buy them for free. Of course it takes time, but for me it's better to get them one by one and get used to the operators and their abilities.
My first operators were Ash and Mute, since then (120h+) I almost unlocked 50% of all operators and just bought Year 3 season pass. Don't stuck with couple operators - every operator has advantages and disadvantages on the maps.

[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]
* Game is optimized
* Great graphics 
* Servers are good
* Variety of operators that fits your play style
* Variety of maps, new missions 
* It's fun, tactical and competitive

[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]
* Toxic people
* Casual is mixed of high and lower rank players - not balanced
* You have to pay for Boosters to get more renown to unlock operators or to pay to unlock them. If you don't want to pay you have to grind renown and unlock the operators - it takes time.
* Even if you're really good player on ranked - you need to have decent teammates to rank up
* It takes time to learn recoil, maps, spots and tricks - watch guides on YouTube
* Price - wait for sale
* Ubisoft client must be used
* Skins, operators and all in-game purchased are expensive. For example Year 3 Season pass is 29.99€ 
More about the season pass here: https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-315663/the-year-3-pass-is-here-


[i]I think that's for now and I definitely recommend that game. If something new pops out I'll edit that review.[/i]

[b]Thanks for stopping by to read it.[/b]
This game... OH THIS GAME.  I got this game believing that I would be playing a tacticool shooter that involved alot of thought.  Although this is true to some extent, aim is KEY.  The game has probably one of the highest skill ceilings of any game i've played.  Keep in mind this is Ubisoft.  The devs can be extremely annoying sometimes not fixing issues that are apparent and hated until months after release of the change that caused said issue.  That being said, the bugs and issues can be looked over.  Although hit registration is GARBAGE and has been better and worse throughout different seasons.  During the new "Operation Health" a season designed to literally FIX BUGS AND ISSUES has made the hit reg worse than it has been in the past.  Example: you drone out a room and find the enemy.  You know where the enemy is and shoot at them hitting the head.  In the kill cam, you see that their head is tilted back clipping into their body and a cloud of blood is covering their face.  As frustrating as this can be, it is something that gets better and worse.  Although this is a part of the game I would still call the game playable and enjoyable.  After roughly 2k hours in this game I have to say that it has lost the original luster it once had.  However, I still come back and play this game semi-often and come back when new content is released.  The community is very "eccentric"  I suppose you could say.  It's mainly a wasteland of memes and cancer but hey atleast its entertaining.  Long story short, buy the game its worth the money.  DO NOT BUY THE "starter edition".  This will put you at a severe disadvantage and make you pay alot more to unlock things.  Speaking of unlocking things, there is no paid DLC or gameplay content locked behind a PayWall.  All buyable content is strictly cosmetic and most of it can be earned by simply earning points by playing the game.  Buy it.  It is in fact worth it.  Just be aware its not without its fair share of baggage and can be daunting to new players.  Learn from others, watch kill cams and watch Youtubers play it.  You will get better and it will get more fun.

[b]Rainbow Six Siege[/b] is one if not the best FPS game I ever played... Let me try to describe it for you.

Rainbow Six Siege is a Tactical Shooter which its focus is completly in the multiplayer and competitive, with just some "tutorials" that are done alone and can give you some Renown, these are called Situations and there are 11 Situations, 10 are Alone against Bots and the last one called Article 5 is cooperative against bots, like a normal "Terrorist Hunt - Bomb" but with some story being it.

So, the multiplayer where this game shines is composed for 2 groups of operators, one being Attackers and the other Defenders, every round you switch between them with your teammates. Rainbow Six Siege has 3 gamemodes avaliable right now, which are:

[h1]BOMB:[/h1] Attackers have a defuser which has to plant near the bomb - Defenders need to defend A and B from the Attackers.

[h1]Secure the Area:[/h1] Defenders have a Biohazzard Container which they have to defend from the Attackers. Attackers have to  stay near the Biohazzard for 10 secs to win. (If both teams are alive near the Container even if the time runs out, they keep there forever until one of them leave or die on the area.

[h1]Hostage:[/h1] Defenders have to defend a hostage, which attackers have to rescue. If attackers get their hand on the hostage all they have to do is run out of the map near the smokes outside and it's over, they won it.

Also there's two kind of games to play the gamemodes, Casual and Ranked.

[h1]Casual:[/h1] It's made to play for fun, practice or just to get enough level to play ranked. Which team scores 3 first win, and if theres a draw it joins the overtime and who wins takes the victory.

[h1]Ranked:[/h1] It's a competitive match, where you and your teams decide where to spawn/protect, who win 4 rounds take the victory. If theres a draw it's extended for 2 more rounds, winning who makes 6 rounds. Also, Ranked is only avaliable for players which have got Level 20 on the game, and after 10 Ranked games played you get a ranked based on your performace on those games.

So, knowing all gamemodes you may think "Wow, that's not too much for a expensive game like that...". But that's not how it works young padawan. The game have classes of characters called ingame as Operators, which operator has it's own Skill, that can used in favor for their team.

Every operator (Besides recruit) have 2 Reinforced walls to put in game, that can be used in Walls and Trapdoors.

One Primary Weapon (Defenders mostly use SMG's and Attackers Rifles)

Secundary Weapon (Pistols in most of the cases)

The Special Skill of which Operator.

And Gadgets, which are;
Defenders Gadgets: Nitro Cells, Deployable Shield, Cameras and Barbed Wire.
Attackers Gadgets: Breach Charge, Drone, Frag Grenade, Rappel and FlashBang Granade.

People need to realize that we're reviewing Rainbow Six Siege, not Uplay.

If you like competitive shooter games where you get one life per round, then you'll like this game.
You know when you are bored so you decide to write an in-depth review about one of you're favrouite games? Well here it is.

Bare in mind that this review is aimed for new players starting out...

[u] INTRO [/u]

Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical first person shooter where it excels in intense 5v5, highly competitive close quarter combat. Rainbow Six Siege (or R6S) is one of  the most inovative first person shooters, focusing highly on teamwork to gather information and take out your foes.

[u] OPERATORS [/u]

In R6S players will have a choice of operators to pick from before a match starts. These operators have to be unlocked through in-game currency called "Renown" that is earned by completing matches, completing Terrorist Hunt missions and finally by successfully completing challenges that are given daily in game as well as weekly in the UPLAY overlay. Anyway, depending on the edition of the game you bought, you will start of with some default operators (usually easy to use for begginers). Every operator in the game has its own unique special ability or "Main Gadget". These gadgets, in the right hands, can aid you and you're team to victory. Ubisoft done a great job adding personality into these characters; all which have their own voice actors and quotes in game. All of the operators come from well-know Counter Terrorist Units that are active around the globe. CTUs such as the SAS, GIGN and FBI SWAT and many more are all featured in this game. The devs are always coming up with new operators and they always surprise me with what the release in terms of new gadgets.

[u] ATTACK [/u]

The attackers in R6S must work together to secure an objective that is situated inside a building. When the match begins, attackers will have some time to prepare the attack by scouting the area using remote controlled drones that can be used to relay intel to you teamates by spotting enemies and finding the objective. Attackers may use their drones as much as they like as long as they have not been destroyed by the defenders. When the "Preperation Phase" has finished the attacking team will now be able to enter the building and fight their way to the objective. Every attacking operator can scale the map by rapelling up and down to get better angles or reach a roof / balcony. Finally attackers have exclusive equipment that can also help them to secure objectives such as Claymores to watch you're back, smoke granades to cover lines of sights and Frag / Flash granades to flush out defenders in the objective.

[u] DEFEND [/u]

Defening in R6S is always different. Many maps have their own characteristics and defenders must adapt to defend specific rooms. While the attackers are droning in "Preperation Phase", defenders have to fortifiy their position by reinforcing walls that can be breached and destroying attackers drones to prevent them from gathering intel. When playing as a defender in R6S, players may conjure different playstyles; Roaming - where a player will run around the map trying to harras attackers before they make their way to the objective, or just simply holding you're ground in the objective room and watching angles. This all depends on what operators have been picked. Furthermore, defenders are also have exclusive equipment that can can be deployed. A deployable shield can be placed in doorway to force enemies to vault over and reducing their accuracy slightly or they can be used for mobile cover. Barbed Wire is a excellent choice to gather information through sound and to also slow down the attackers. C4 or "Nitro Cells" can be used to blow up you're oponents remotely; it can be stuck to surfaces to blow up walls and ceilings too. Finally defenders have access to "Impact Granades" which instantly explode when they make contact with a player or wall. They are usually used to create rotation holes in and around the objective.

[u] MAPS & ENVIRONMENT [/u]

R6S has a vast selection of maps where different tactics are required. A typical map will consist of three floors: Basement (B), First Floor (F1) and Second Floor (F2). Each map contains destructible walls that can be destroyed and penetrated by both teams. Higher caliber weapons will siginficantly increase the damage to a given surface. Shotguns are a great choice to quickly open up hatches or holes in the wall. Every season a new map is added and it reflects the new operators that come with it. For example with the new operators being Spanish, the new map will be Featured in spain.

[u] GAMEMODES [/u]

There are only THREE gamemodes in R6S: Secure Area - where attackers must access a specific room and hold it for a certain amount of time. Defenders can contest the objective if they are together with the enemy. Its very similar to hardpoint from other games if you wish but it stays in one place. Hostage - where the defenders must prevent the attacking team to capture the hostage and extract it outside the map. If the hostage is killed by an attacker the defenders win the round but if a defenders decide to execute the hostage for any reason then the atacking team will win the round. Finally we have Bomb - where one attacker is equiped with a diffuser that is needed to diffuse one of the two chemical bombs that the defenders are protecting. When the diffuser is planted, defenders must act quickly to destroy the diffusing device by approching it and holding the interact button. Attackers will win if the diffuser completes its job or all the defenders are dead.

[u] COMMUNITY [/u]

This is in time of writing the 4th most played game on Steam. The R6S community is a mixed bag so to say. I personally came accross amazing teammates which I have become good friends with online. There are a lot of friendly players that you will come across that will communicate with you and praise you for doing the same and playing well. However, you will also encounter trolls and toxic players in this game but Ubisoft's Anti-Cheat Battleye is constantly banning toxic players that have been reported for toxic behaviour such as intentional teamkilling and constant use of homphobic slurs and racism in chat. If you encounter those people just igonre and report them. They will almost guaranteed to be banned since the devs have took toxicity seriously in this game recently.

[u] CONS [/u]

Although the game is very well optimised, it suffers from hit registration problems. Where headshots are key in this game as they will instantly kill you, players like myself have become quite frustrated when you land a headshot and it just does not connect. In some cases you can hit an enemy, see blood come out but they will take no damage. You will know this becaue when they kill you, the kill-cam will display the killers health. However Ubisoft is working hard and they are implementing a better system to help with sight missalignment to provide the best hit reg. 

Moreover, there are some minor bugs when it comes to the Ragdoll physics of the game. Some dead bodies may spaz out and have their arms or legs elongated although its not gamebreaking.

Most of the significant glitches that players exploited have been fixed such as the "Shield operator no recoil glitch" that was found by accident.

[u] CONCLUSION [/u]

To summarise, I would higly recommend Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege to all FPS lovers. Take your time to learn the maps and operators. There are lots of guides out there and videos that explain how to play as each operator. This game is absolutely amazing when played with friends so don't be shy to make some in-game! 

- Bartozy
100% reccomend this game. By far the best shooter I have ever played. Single life, short time to kill, instant-death headshots, this game rewards the careful aimer and punishes the slightest mistakes harshly. Destructible environments mean you create your own tactical edges over your opponents, and can attack each room a whole host of different ways. Favourite game out there, and with the new anti-cheat finally kicking in, I can happily write a good review.
WARNING TO ANYONE WHO WANTS THIS GAME, DON'T BUY THE STARTER EDITION. EVERY OPERATOR COSTS SO MUCH MORE AND THE GAME IS A LOT WORSE WITH THE LIMITED SELECTION AVAILABLE.
I am gonna go ahead and compare Rainbow Six Siege to CS:GO, like many others do - but there's a good reason for that.
To give you an understanding of my transition to Siege, you must know that I've played over 1,600 hours of CS:GO on this account and another 600 on my smurf account. To this day I think that CS:GO is one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made, but at this point it has been heavily malnourished by its creators and in turn, the community. 
What I love about CS:GO is the factor of skill. A testament to a good game is that you get better at it the more you play, and CS is, or WAS, just that. That was when the only thing that mattered in the game was how good of a player you are. But that has changed a long time ago. CS:GO has become a money making machine and nothing more. Valve has proven to not give a crap about the "everyday player" by having an anti-cheat system that is beyond broken. For a company that makes SO MUCH money, you'd think that protecting the game from cheaters would be their priority. It isn't. The priority is new cases, skins - simply just more ways to make more money. I came to a point where I had to pay an additional 7$ a month for ESEA to properly play CS:GO, but I gave hope of supporting a game that is simply heading nowhere. And I'm not going to dwell deeper into the community - anyone who has ever played the game, will know how toxic, immature and unpleasant it is.

After I gave up hope on Counter Strike, I started looking for a shooter that would replace it. I've tried many - Insurgency, Battlefield, Call of Duty (well I had to try) to no avail, because even though I had fun playing those games, they were all missing something - something that would keep me there for longer. And then I found Siege. 
Even though I'm only about 90 hours into the game, I already know I'm going to keep playing for a lot, lot longer. It has everything I was looking for. Skill factor? Check. Good maps (mostly) and a lot of ways to approach a situation? Check. Customisation that doesnt require you spending hundreds of dollars? Check. 
With Siege you get to appreciate the hours you put into it, because the game might be easy to get into, but it requires a lot of hard work to master. And that makes it a good shooter. It plays however you want it to play - either fast paced, or a slower tactical approach and it rewards you for actually using your brain. I was never a big fan of Ubisoft, but with this, and the few hours I played of For Honor, they're finally heading in the right direction.

So if you're tired of CS:GO, and you're looking for a replacement, try Siege. If you give it enough time to realise the depth of the game, I'm certain you will not be disappointed.
First rule to play this game : "Use headset".
Oh for god sake, USE it.

For newcomer, pls finish "Situations" before doing Casual match
Oh for god sake, FINISH it.
Rainbow Six Siege is a solid FPS. The community is better than most and the developers listen to feedback, which is sorely needed and a breath of fresh air in the PC gaming world.

Of course there are some balancing, network latency, and team system problems, but Siege still has a framework that works and is constantly being improved upon. Every map has complexity that can be learned through experience, but is frustrating for beginners. Even the game system itself has so many mechanics to learn that it can be very frustrating at the start. This also gives the game great variety and replay value, however, and still retains its value well beyond a year after release. Just embrace that Siege isn't quite like the other shooter games that you play.

Terrorist Hunt lacks the variety and spontaneity that multiplayer offers, but still acts as a healthy diversion from the sometimes frustrating multiplayer experience.

Remembering how far this game has come since its beta just strengthens my resolve that it will continue to be a great FPS with a healthy population for (hopefully) a long time.

Full Disclosure: This game was given as a gift from a family member NOT affiliated with UBiSoft

I'll do my best to keep this brief, but I feel that you should know where I come from before you buy this game or take my words into consideration. I've been a R6 fan since a child, have enjoyed most of the games. My favorite being Rainbow Six 3. I liked Vegas as well, but am fully aware that that game wasn't what R6 was about, which is methodical movement, and tactical planning. Vegas represnted a shift from the more slow, tactical game, towards a generally more fast paced cover shooter, which I fully enjoyed...but I would be remiss if I didn't say I enjoyed the  slower game more. So that's my history with R6, and generally I don't enjoy too many FPS games, but I've played countless hours of CS 1.6, and Source, as well as a crap ton of DooM 1/2

So with that in mind, let's talk about the game. I am going to entirely focus on the current state of the game, as people who are buying it now won't have any idea about the past. The game itself works fine, not many bugs are present (thanks to ironing out of a lot of bugs through the last year. (If you want to know more about the horrible state of the initial game I'm sure some loser much like myself wrote a whole entire thesis about it)

Graphics-Even while a year old, the game is still alluring. If you're the graphics whore type, I don't think you'll be disappointed.

Sound- Because of the way this game is played, alot of detail was put into how sounds are made, and how you hear them. I should also note that the sound in this game is a gameplay element. Simply put, if you want to get good at this game, LISTEN. Broken glass near you and you hear footsteps crunching? Your enemy might be there! (or a friend, watch that FF yo)

Will you (or I) have fun?- That depends. See, I am a total hermit, I don't like people generally, nor  do I care for MMO's..or whatever you call todays MMOs (I like the term CRAP). The reason I bring this up is that this game is MEANT FOR MULTIPLAYER ONLY. So please keep that in mind. I enjoy this game completely. You can tell based on the HORRIBLE FACT that have put in 700+ hours into this game. I literally noticed this fact yesterday and had to lay on the ground and re-evaluate my life. This game is great, I liken it to playing a shooter, but having some puzzle elements to it. Gameplay is boiled down to this:

----Two teams of five operators square off on either a King of the Hill style match, hostage rescue, or bomb defusal scenario-----

----Each operator has some special ability depending on them being attacker/defender, I won't go into specifics here, but you should look them up, also Montaigne is my favorite. Attacker/Defender abilities are designed to counter each other, aka one operator is paper, and another is rock. This is an oversimplification of course, but that's the general idea.
---THERE IS ALSO a mode called Terrorist Hunt which pits a team of five against NPCs, can be fun if you don’t like playing against people because they are too mean and hurt your feelings.

---Teams have to work together coordinating their abilities to complete their objectives, when they win they all go to Dizneeland (TM) and have the most amazing time.---

In order for this game to be fun, you have to work together, coordination is key. If that is your bag, then I would recommend this game to you. Playing with friends (as in with most multiplayer games) would make this game more enjoyable. But I don't have friends, so to hell with you. This game is also enjoyable playing solo with random other players. Generally the player base here is a lot more mature than I’ve seen in other games (COUGH OVERWATCH COUGH), which is a huge plus for me, because I’m getting old, and don’t like kids. I hope this review is helpful, and you RESEARCH this game properly before you buy it. BE A SMART consumer. Thanks, and take care.

purchases game, level one peasant, 
proceeds to join game, 
chat spammed with lord chanka
types in "who is lord chanka"
gets teamkilled for sinning against the lord
20 hours into the game later,

teammate asks who this is
proceeds to kill teammate.
the cycle of life

Accidentally pressed "G" and tossed a grenade into a wall which promptly landed at the bottom of my team-mates feet and detonated.

Guy: "Hey man can we take it easy on the grenades?"

After playing CS: GO I didnt expect that reaction

I immediately apologized and we continued

9/10
-Accidentally shot a mate while pursuing a drone.
-He shot me in the head.
-Another mate nails him in the head.
-The other guy panics and shoots him.
-Last guy put his shield up and got into cover in a corner in fear.

**Fear intensifies** 100/100
You start firing and a teammate steps in front of you, he gets teamkilled.

CSGO Reaction: SUKA BLYAT IDI NAHUJ *vote kick* FUCK YOUR MOM

Rainbow Six Reaction: Hey sorry for stepping in front of you mate!

11/10 would never play CSGO ever again
I was playing Spetsnaz operative Fuse for mother Russia, my foreign comrades have all died, it was just me against 5 other foreign police operatives, I didn't know why we were fighting eachother, I only knew that I had to kill them all for the great motherland and avenge my fallen comrades, I hid myself in a room next to the hostage, I could hear them rushing into the room, trying to overpower me with sheer force, they were closing in on the hostage looking for me, that's when I knew what I had to do, I placed my fuze charge on the wall overlooking the hostage, I prayed that Stalin's mighty mustache would smile upon me and give me the power to win this, instantly my teammates started screaming "NOOOO THE HOSTAGE!" but it was too late, the grenades flew in, exploding all over the room, all 6 of them have been killed, as I walked over their dead bodies, I looked at the dead hostage, smiled and said "Thank you, comrade, you were good bait"

I knew I won.

TL:DR: It's a good game with a friendly community that welcome new player, just dont buy STARTER EDITION, and don't mind of what other ppl said bout ubisoft (especially those who never play the game), it's worth every penny.

10/10 my fav FPS game so far. <3

One of the best FPS game I've ever played.
This is my first review so I'm sorry for the mistake.
Let's review some basic things:

[b]Gameplay[/b]
This game is different from other FPS games, it's unique in it's own way. Do you ever played a game where you can blow literally a house down? I don't think so.

[b]Guns[/b]
Ubisoft really put a thing about guns, Every single gun have it own unique stats and thus affecting your play style. For example, Mira's Vector submachine gun have [i]SANIC SPEED[/i] rate of fire and [i]HOLY SH!T[/i] recoil while Pulse's Ump45 have a more stable recoil and a slower RoF and greater damage. And putting a barrel attachment affects the guns (Silencer decreases the damage, etc.).

[b]Operators[/b]
Every single Operators are individually unique. They affect your play style (obviously duh) and they have their own skills and stats (More armor, More Speed or balanced). But I'll put more attention on the skills, the skills will determine whether your operators is to roam or not to roam (for defenders operators) and go alone and rush or stick with your teammates and help them (for attackers operators). For example...

[table]
[tr]
 [th]Role[/th]
 [th]Name[/th]
 [th]Play style[/th]
 [th]Skill[/th]
 [th]Description[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
 [th]Defender[/th]
 [th]Kapkan[/th]
 [th]Defend at site[/th]
 [th]Laser Explosive Traps[/th]
 [th]Kapkan skill is not very suitable for roaming as he must lay the traps at the doors and windows, and this works best in the room where the objective is located to prevent the attackers from going in.[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
[th]Defender[/th]
[th]Caveira[/th]
[th]Roamer[/th]
[th]Silent Step and Interrogation[/th]
[th]Caveira is one of those roamers, she needs to roam around the map and search for isolated enemy and down them so that you can interrogate the enemy and reveal the rest of the enemy team position and operators for 10 secs.[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
[th]Attacker[/th]
[th]Thermite[/th]
[th]Grouper[/th]
[th]Thermite Breaching Charge[/th]
[th]His skill is a Thermite Breaching Charge that can destroy reinforced walls, he needs to be with his teammates so that he can help to breach a reinforced wall to the objective or make another flank route.[/th]
[/tr]
[tr]
[th]Attacker[/th]
[th]Ash[/th]
[th]Go Alone... sad[/th]
[th]Rocket launcher that stick and explodes[/th]
[th]She can create a flank route with her rocket and flank enemies from behind.[/th]
[/tr]
[/table]

[b]Conclusion[/b]
I recommend this game, if you don't have enough money take the starter edition. The community is one of the nicest in gaming.


I RATE THIS GAME 9.5/10
[spoiler]ALL PRAISE LORD CHANKA[/spoiler]
People are going to ask me "Dude, How the hell you can review this game when you got less than 100 hours?" and I actually can understand you at some point but this is my first impression from the game.

As the time passed on, I pretty much got bored of playing CS GO all the time and really wanted to find a new game that based on similar concept and my friend told me "You really should try R6S", For sure, CS GO is not the same as R6S but they pretty much got one thing in common. It requires a lot of strategy and teamwork in order to win matches.

Gameplay : By my own experience. Most of the time. The gameplay was feeling kinda slow but that's how it's supposed to be I guess as this game requires strategy and careful planning or you pretty much going to die and you know that you did a huge mistake and as a result you got punished by the game.But at the same time it feels rewarding since you learning from it and trying not to do the same thing again.

Community : I have already experienced lots of toxicity and many other things from different games that I'm playing at the moment such as CS GO, Overwatch and League of Legends and I thought it would be quite the same on R6S as well. Well, I was actually really surprised. Now of course nobody is going to avoid toxicity since people with anger management issues would play the game and I have met some toxic people on this game but most of the time I have got matched with people who actually know how to play the game and also being very helpful for the new players. You know how good it is to meet people who act as human beings after coming back from a game with toxic people?

Graphics and optimization : When I hear that a game is made by Ubisoft, My thought is going to be "Ohh damn, another broken game with lots of performance issues" but it was really far away from what I thought. I'm playing on i7 4790 and GTX 1070 on the Maxed out settings (With the Ultra HD textures as well) with the T-AA and indeed can maintain above 144FPS without any problem and the game indeed looks well

In conclusion, I really looking forward to keep playing this game in the future and would try a bit the competitive match-making really soon (Would update the review about it later on) and have to say that Ubisoft did here a great job with the game and indeed improved it overtime and kudos to the devlopers of the game about it! I can without any doubt recommend this game for people who are looking for a strategic game that they can enjoy for a long time.

Competitive MM : It took quite some time for me to decide how the MM is, Each game has it's own flaws but the MM does have some really serious issues that make the competitive mode to look like a joke and yes, I'm mostly talking about leavers. The penalties are pretty much worthless and doesn't do anything in order to prevent players from leaving the matches. 15 minutes for each penalty (May be fine for the first cooldown) isn't enough by any means. And some matches can be frustrating not because of a poor teamwork but when you have to start the game as 4vs5 or even worse in some games. When a person disconnects in the first round. it should offer to the team the option (Like a remake that exists on LoL) if they want to continue the match or shut it down and only the leaver would get a lose. But when everything is going as it should be (Getting a great teammates or going with your premades), Then indeed the competitive is worth it and can provide a lot of great time.

Overall rating : 8/10
18/1/2018: Added "Competitive MM" (Sorry if it looks like a rant)
[h1]Pros:[/h1]
You can play however stupid you want
[h1]Cons:[/h1]
You can't say that your teammates are stupid, because your message will be sent to ubi and then you will be banned

If your game has mute and gag futures in the scoreboard, why do you need to ban people from your game?
Imagine CSGO
But without the cancer
with realistic physics and gun spray
combine these things together and you get rainbow six: Siege

honestly though the most fun shooter i've played in a long time
12/10
After 2 years of play and almost 1,000 hours of gameplay I'm finally writing a review for this game.

Where to begin? This game has such a unique blend of skill and tension, the one shot headshot mechanic is what really makes this so fast paced yet strategic. I believed in this game since the closed alpha and it's really been a testament to how a video game can bounce back from the brink, just the fact that this game is still recieving players and content this far from launch is just incredible. 

9/10
Buy this game if you like getting frustrated
Buy this game if you like toxic people
Buy this game if you like small children blaming you for everything
Buy this game if you like getting your hopes up
Buy this game if you like Buggy servers 
Buy this game if you like bullshit gameplay

But, here is a big but

Buy this game if you like feeling good over your knowlegde of the map
Buy this game if you like the feeling you get when you wallbang an enemy because of a simple footstep you heard 
Buy this game if you like trashtalking from the enemy, and they call you a hacker 
Buy this game if you like realistic shooting games

All in all, I love this game, and it feels better and better for every hour spent. 

10/10 would absoulty bang Twitch
Okay so i've been playing this game for one year now, and it turns out to be my cup of tea
Visual is good, gunplay is good, matchmaking is good, community is fine, server is fine.

The game itself is now cheaper than last year, so i think if you want to try this game pick it now or when is sale, and please pick Standard Edition because Starter Edition is very grindy. 

I bought the Complete Edition when its 50% off, and for me is really worth the price. I have a blast in 2018 with Siege.

Overall really solid FPS game for PC. 
Score: 9 out of 10
its a decent game but please wait for a sale, play for the free weekend first and NEVER buy the starter edition. Its a scam and you cant upgrade at a later date. You will have to make a new steam account just to get a better edition of the game

R6 is the best FPS that I've played. Some people can be toxic but it's the internet. If you really want to do well, i would suggest getting involved with a squad of at least 3 people. This is the game I've played the most of since my wow days. currently at 720 hrs and I am ranked at gold 2. 

Pros: 
Competitive 
Graphically Pleasing
Many Ops to pick from
Supportive community
Pro-League

Cons: 
Team Killing
Hackers - in the form of wall hackers, teleporting, aim bots.
I usually hate competitive games, like CS and Dota because those games make me nervous and stressful when playing.
But Siege give me winning feeling even when my a** got kicked the first second of the round.
The more you play, the more you learn about the operators, the maps, and cheeky strats.
Congrats for the 45 million players. I hope the game will last long bcs I just bought it after 3 years of release T.T
I suck at this game, yet i have played it more then 1000 hrs with my friends. Its really a very fun game. 
(NOTE:- get some friends, squad up and you are good to go. But do avoid going solo though, its not too much fun while playing solo. ) 
Thats all folks, now stop reading this, get your ass up and go buy this game ASAP!!!!!!!!!!!
IS a game. When is shield game, is no fun game. If shield no game in round, maybe fun round. But and when is shield around, is make very frustrate when is shield. I liked more if no shield ever in me rounds. But other is good but the shield so many down. 

Plese no shield workers anymore in game or is just more nofun rounds. :(
At first,it was quite hard to play the game as I didn't have much experience with FPS.However,I persisted and played this game day and night,every day of every week,for almost 6 months straight.The game has a lot of content,and is constantly having new content added to it every season(there are four seasons a year).The experience in this game would have been better if I would have been matched with English-speaking people,but it's alright.In EAS(East Asian Servers),you will pretty much never meet someone who speaks English because the people you'll meet are Chinese.The people in EAS,at least the people I get matched with,won't really talk much though so if you want to play the game in peace,hey there.Buy this game ;)

I can confidently say that you won't regret buying this game.Please buy this game.

P.S. I love Mama Mary <3
This game was very good in its early days, you could have fun making strategies and using operators and their abilities in creative ways. 

Sadly this is 4 years later after release and I haven't played since early 2018. The game no longer grabs my attention as it use to and the community is what ruined this game for me. Some people just don't understand what the term casual really means.

If you can pick this game up on sale for $15 or less then give it a try, having friends to play with also boosts its value. 
Personally, I probably won't play this game again unless it is with friends, that's just me.
This game is trash, thee most rage inducing game, worse then dark souls in my opinion. The game has the worst hit reg ive seen. But i'd recommend 10/10 quite fun
Obviously the environment on here is all salt. The ceiling is salt, the floor is salt, and to an extent, the air is salt. And, you breathe that in and you constantly taste the salt.


10/10 Would sweat again.
First of all. I got dyslexia so sorry for any of the grammar mistakes that there WILL be in this

I would recommend this game to anyone who like tactical FPS's, the game is really fun to play alone and with friends (better with friends tho). The game itself does have a big variens of bugs and glitches sadly, some of them can be a bit game breaking. But the devs are working hard on fixing the game, but they priorite balacinging the game over fixing it. Since the game itself is not so broken you can't play it and desprice the amount of bugs and glitches. It's still really fun to play, plus it brings something different to the tact shooter games, something I really like. 

The game do have many pros and cons

Pros: 

- Can be played for many hours and it never feels repetitive! (Which is many biggest issue with many games. I get bored cause I feel like I am doing the same thing over and over again, yet I got 1660+ hours on record as I make this review. My most played game ever)

- Fun to play with your friends, both casual and ranked. 

- You can play the way you like more or less, carefull, fast, tactical or braindead. Some things work better than others no doubt. But thats where casule come it. Braindead play and just have fun!

- A lot of weapons gadgets and ops (Operator) and more will come with time!!!

- The game is rather cheap now, if you buy the cheapest version! (But definitely worth getting ultimate!)

- There are microtransactions in this game (Which can be a con) But they are ONLY for cosmetics! You can buy ops with real money too. But its not worth it and you can obtain them with time! It seems like a big grind if you are new. But it's not so bad! But you can't buy something that makes you stronger or faster, or something dumb like that

- Good game to show off your shooting skills! And improve too if you want to be a better shot! 

- New ops and maps every 3 months!

- Rank system really lets you know how close you are too ranking up or deranking!

Cons: 

- The game is broken in many ways and it can be REALLY annoying sometimes

- Hitreg (Ubisoft) Whats a hitreg? You get the idea right? Its dumb sometimes. Works mostly but sometimes it's just like you shoot blanks out of your gun

- A lot of grinding of you don't buy ultimat and brutal environment for newcomers. (But the next update coming here march 2019 will give newcomers a mode just for them! So now is really the time to get Siege!)

- Really toxic and I mean REALLY toxic community and salty people. It makes some leave and I don't blame them

- Smokes and flashes aren't really made useful enough so the utility play in the game isn't so big and important apart from op gadgets. 

- Can take some time to really get use to how different this game is compared to most tac shooters- 

- Usually when new ops are added to the game, they start of kinda op. So new seasons can be a pain for non season pass owners. 


- Ranked system is kind of weird. You start of with getting just as much elo as you lose when you win/lose. But if you play a lot on that season you get less and less elo when you win. But loses less when you lose too. But at some point you lose more then you gain

That about covers it! I might edit this if more comes to mind! I hope you find this helpful!!
i enjoy this game a lot but there is a learning curve that comes with it.  If you stick with it you will know all the bells and whistles and feel like a badass when you know where to wallbang people thru soft walls. Of course this game is fun with friends but playing ranked on your own is torture.
I bought the Starter Edition of this game last year but didn't really gave it too much attention (Was busy with pubg). Solo-ing on Terrorist Hunt is either too easy on Normal and too difficult on Hard, playing with randoms also means you don't get that much kills. Unlocking new Operators was also too much grinding and casual multiplayer with randoms was toxic 7 out of 10 times.

I recently decided to give it another go, spent a little bit on renown to get the year 1 and 2 operators, spent more time memorizing maps AND STARTED PLAYING WITH FRIENDS.

I'm hooked. 

The game is a thousand times more enjoyable with friends. In-fact don't even buy the game if you don't plan on gaming with people you know because you will need constant communication with your squad throughout multiplayer matches and there is no guarantee that you will not team up with a toxic random jerk or jerks if you do solo.

P.S.: SSD OK!?!
Gameplay is a yes, graphics are a yes, fun is a yes.

But beware. If you are easily triggered and hate games with a toxic community, this is props not the game for you. After almost 500 hours on this I've grew used to it and basically have nerves made out of steal.
Not so friendly for newcomers. 
Fun and exciting to play once you get the hang of it. 
Customizable guns for different needs.
Takes time to get used to different unique operators.
Learning different maps thoroughly is the hardest part.
Insanely thrilling and satisfying to clutch.
Equally frustrating to get stomped.
Mute and report sweaty nerds and toxic players.
Better with friends.
its cool and fun game but there is 2 big main issues still left sience 2015 ! 1-wierd and stupid bugs 2-full of cheaters with aim lock and wallhacks !

i have just learned how to select operators so this makes the game better than before but still this game needs more operators you can counter theres a few in the game right now and those are lion, jackal, doki, ash and blitz but the rest are stupid op!
This game has a very steep learning curve, but as soon as you learn the basics it's gonna feel really good to destroy people in casual play. In all seriousness, it's a very fun game, and the experience is even better with friends.
I have nearly 350 hours into the game and i plan to put many more hours into the game but i highly recommend this game if you're looking at purchasing!  
For new players it can be pretty hard to learn but once you've given it chance, learn't how to play etc, you will really enjoy the content that is provided! Anyone looking to buy this game 100% purchase! 

I purchased this game a while back as the version where i pay 12500 for the base operators. I went to upgrade it and it won't allow me to upgrade the game so that i can get all the operators like everyone else. Hell the game is cheaper right now than it was when i purchased that pack. Fix this please.
I cant stop playing this game. Almost everything about this game is on point, the only thing I don"t enjoy is getting put into ungoing games, other then that is great and a one of a kind.
Amazing game! If you are looking form an intense , strategy filled FPS then this is for you.
You jump into a hectic match with 4 teamates and 5 enemies , every move counts with a fully destructable enviroment and many tactics to go along with this realistic gameplay.
this game, oh man this game, if you know anyone who doesn't like this game, kick them out of your life, there not your friend anymore unless they learn to LOVE this game okay? its the greatest game of all time, period.
Fun game for silly play and sometimes on MP if you have your own team.  However playing with random people is risky because there are a lot of players that join public games just to team kill.  On co-op mode normal mode is rather easy but not unbalanced.  Hard and Realism modes are totally worthless, the AI can shoot through entire buildings and still hit you.  Unisoft also hosts the game over their own network which is subpar on a good day.  The in game advancements are also pointless and do nothing for the game play other than give you something to spend your game time on... however it costs a lot of game time to get any of those little gems on the side.

Overall its a 4/10, the graphics are lovely and the game on its own runs smoothly.  Its worth the 9$ sale price but anything over that isn't worth the buy.  The game clearly wasn't  built, balanced or supported by any professional groups so paying a professionals cost would be silly.  That said however, if you just was a cheap game to play with some friends to act foolish on then its not a bad option.  My friends and I have a lot of fun on it, assuming uplay doesn't crash a dozen times a night.
Siege is a really fun and innovative because of  awesome  game mechanics like breaching, no jumping only vaulting (vaulting's good because how would some one wearing a 50 pound vest with all there gadgets jump), and the drones.
*me in 1v5 situation*
Me:*using montagne being cornered*
Them:*throwing nitro cells at me*

*Big Explosion*
It's a fun game to play with friends
ranked is mostly toxic but casual is fun most of the time
the servers turn into dumpsters once a month for a day 
graphics are good
the game is alive and active and gets updates a lot
I suggest that you buy it after seeing some gameplay or playing in a free weekend or something
I wish I could just give my copy of this away. It sounded like a great game, and loads do enjoy it, it just wasn't for me though and I bought it along with a few of the expansions in a sale. Think I've only played a few hours. Such a shame and such a waste seeing as people love it. C'mon Steam, can't you add that function? I'm sure the Dev's would rather someone played it. It's not like it's piracy if I can't play it after gifting it to someone. Maybe I should of refunded, but, it took me a while to get round to installing it. Guess I'll recommend it.
An awesome game. This game is a tactical fps that is superb. Here are a couple of tricks to getting into playing. First, unlock an operator that u have fun with or at least has utility on any map. Thermite or Twitch are a great option but it is up to you. Also, plan to use game chat as this game heavily requires teamwork

The best tactical fps around by a fair distance. You might find it a bit difficult to understand the machanics at first but if u stick to the game long enough to be able grasp the game design and gameplay elements , be sure , you will thoroughly enjoy this game .
Highly recommend it to all fps lovers
This game will get you in some way/shape/form. Tip of advice for starting into this game: Start in Terrorist Hunt. You will be out of order hardcore when you try to get into picks and people in casuals will be a bit unforgiving; as the game mechanics are. Once you feel comfy, getting used to the game mechanics--you'll get knocked down but it's all about picking yourself back up. The trick to playing this is like any competitive game; practice makes perfect.

I don't give it a perfect five; but they are working hard to fix their bugs and other issues. Train hard, and you'll succeed well within the game! Remember your gadgets! :)
This is the game you wanna play for long time and worth for money. Best to play with friends. Frequent updates good, and yes don't forgot Ubisofts cancer server. :)
tl;dr: I recommend R6S for fans of fast paced FPS games, but you'll want to either schedule play times with friends or work on growing a thick skin to handle the very noticeable toxic section of the community.
~

R6S is absolutely my favorite team based FPS with a growing community, but it admittedly does take some getting used to. As someone who sank several thousand hours each into Battlefield series and CoD, I've played super close quarters maps, massively wide open maps, destructible environments, tactical gear, you name it and I was sure I knew how to handle it. I wasn't entirely wrong, at least.

More than anything else when starting R6S, I would have to recommend that you learn proper positioning. Exposing even just a knee from behind cover or around a doorway can lead to unexpected death. With most walls, floors, ceilings, and furniture being destructible, penetrable, or even just permeable, you should definitely learn where you are safe and where you are not. This, of course, works both ways; if you know you can't use the couches in the Consulate for reliable cover, you'll be much more likely to catch an enemy off guard when they haven't learned that lesson yet.

On the topic of map size, the majority of maps, as of this review, do not have more than one or two particular spots where truly long-range firefights can occur, and in fact unless you are VERY confident in your reaction time they are a nightmare for the attacking team. A good spawn-peek (which happens far more than one might hope) can halve the attacking team's force in the first 30 seconds of a round with very little chance to retaliate. The strongest optics for any weapon in the game (with the exception of Glaz's OTs-03 rifle) are the ACOG sights, so the more realistically close-in environments make sense.

The game 100% earned the "Better With Friends" award, as playing random pickup groups can be both frustrating in queue time, and in dealing with (at least) a solid 1/3 of the community being toxic enough to qualify as a meme. If you are not playing in a preformed group consistently, you WILL experience verbal harassment, being team-killed with or without reason, unexpectedly vote-kicked (again with or without reason), and griefing. The only options you have are to report or leave the match and hope for better next game.

With all that being said, you will still find that most matches aren't as bad as that (though I have heard it gets worse above gold ranking). There are also non-pvp game modes that can give you a chance to at least learn the basics of each operator as you unlock them, and just getting a starting point of that level can make a world of difference. Another detail not to overlook is the built-in voice chat, as communication between teammates WILL make a difference overall.

I do certainly recommend the game, and would encourage anyone with an interest to at least try the standard edition. You can always upgrade later or buy the operators you're interested in down the line. I've only got about 125 hours of play but I've already unlocked 6 additional operators; maybe not the fastest progression, but free is free, and you do get a bonus to your in-game currency rewards when playing in a group.
Hears small footsteps..looks back..sees noone...looks front...sees cav right in front of me...shoots all around  cuz i get scared n headshots teammates..
10/10 love this game.
I was kind of afraid to get this game, as I'm bad at First Person Shooters. I figured if I didn't like it I could return it, so I bough it. I didn't know how much strategy was needed in this game as "Strategy First Person Shooters" don't often require this much thought. I went in and played though the scenarios until I got to the bomb defusing one. I had to come in through the opposite side of the house to clear Ts and use few breach charges to decrease sneak attacks. Even though I don't meet the minimum system requirements, I can still run it at 30fps.

Overall: Fun experience if hard, and beautifully crafted game.

Would highly recommend.
It's a really worth buying game. I played the free weekend trial. And i have no regret of planning to buy this game. This game is better than PUBG for now. If u don't want to grind much. The higher price opens more operator. But operator are still useless when u don't have skill
This game is great. I originally played this game on the ps4 when it first came out. then i played it on the xbox one. now on PC. im over level 50 on each profile. 10/10 would recommend for someone who is looking for a competitive and realistic game that will also make you depressed
Lots of bugs and many things ubi needs to fix like client side physics. that aside, this is my favorite game. I do not like fps games but this game grew on me fast and very quickly became my number one game, I love how tactical it is with maps that make it even more tactical when you have to wonder around buildings and counter other ops abilities with yours or your teammates. Its a game that pushes teamwork, communication, and skill and I would recommend to literally anyone and I have many times
Fun game. I recommend buying the 60 dollar version if you are going to get into the game because the cheapest version almost forces you to buy in game currency if you want more operators. With my close to 100 hours I've only got 6 operators without buying the rest I have paid for.
i like this game this game is fun
a few things you can do are:
grab a few pals and be the following operators:
rook
smoke
castle
so rook puts his armor in a secluded room and then castle uses his ability to trap people in there and then smoke pops a gas and they die by being gassed. i call it chamber gang 2.0
its just a joke i didnt do this please
Rainbow 6 has a special place in my heart, that place in my heart is the dark side, full of anger and frustration, but other than that the game is a blast with friends! In Siege you have a squad of 5 people (Attackers and Defenders) the attackers have to reach a certain objective (such as a hostage or bomb) and you can either kill the whole enemy team or do the task at hand, soo...

8/10
If you want a short and honest review about Rainbow Six Siege, it's an amazing tactical first person shooter, with both interesting game play and characters that make up Team Rainbow. You should buy this game regardless of sale or not, if you're into the fps genre, as Siege provides a well balanced game play loop that's much more gritty and interesting than Overwatch, which has a somewhat similar concept to Siege in regards to how matches play out, with Siege being a much more strategic and tactical game. 

[b] Decent a Strong 8; I'd purchase with or without a sale! [/b]
This is the best game ever you just  cant get bored never know wat to expect in evry round  and it is a very good tactical game and it's verry fun to play whit friends I give it a 10/10
I started playing in Wind Bastion and I've racked up upwards of 500 hours before the season has even ended. Fun game, ever changing meta, I love the way any match can drastically change based off the ops chosen. Excited for Year 4!
I personally steered clear of this game for the past three years but always kept it on a close watch to see how well it can sustain itself; mostly because Ubisoft didn't have a clear history of maintaining a title this big, and partly because it's Ubisoft, a company with a good long list of shady business practices that you'd be hard pressed to find any publisher (short of ActivisionBlizzard/Bethesda/EA trio) to match. Suffice to say, I'm impressed. The amount of support the devs gave it is astounding, especially compounded with the fact that the game itself had a somewhat botched release, which really shows Ubisoft's commitment on doing it right by not dropping it instantly. For perspective, this game came out on Dec 2015; three years later, and I never waited more than a minute for the matchmaking. 

The game is growing and is now bigger than ever. Its community is lively and ripe with discussions, and although it can and does have toxicity problems like all PVP titles, it's still far cry from the likes of which you can find on, say, CSGO and/or DotA2, at least in my limited experience. This is a good thing, needless to say.

Just recently Ubisoft both gave a glimpse of the support this game will get in the next ten years and declined to ride the battle royale wave, both are statements of which I found really refreshing. In the era of yearly shooters that barely ever made it through their second year, Ubisoft took a huge gamble by sticking to its guns and delivering a long-term service model; a gamble which sold me and millions other over. Here's to a grander Year 4!

P.S. : Ela is the one true bae. Fight me.
Hey this game is great and i would like to help you improve this game.
Things that i think would be great to be added:
-zombie mode
-a setting where you can modify the number of terrorists in terrorist hunt
-more gun attachments
-splitscreen
I hope that you add at least one of these suggestions because that would help out a lot of people  in the game

Welcome to one of the saltiest communities in gaming. TKs, kicks and insults are everywhere but even with that this game manages to get you to keep playing for hours. you want to know the map layout and learn how tor play all the operators. If you get this game don't take it too seriously.
I have nearly 80 hours played on this game but one thing came to my attention the other day. Where are all the doors? I have played nearly every map and have yet to come across a door. Did they remove the doors before the operation or do the developers have something against doors? For now I will be giving this game a solid 7/10 but an explanation on the doors will likely bump it up to an 8.5.
>Throws grenade into room with hostage while telling my team to "watch this yeet"
>Kills hostage but takes entire enemy team of 5 with me

Rainbow Six Siege, Ubisoft's successful attempt at a competitive FPS. 

5v5 destruction and tactics based game play, allowing even the least accurate player a chance to kill someone by sheer (luck) strategy. This game is one of my all-time favourite games, I've bought it twice now and spent over $300 on the game.

BUT

The community is toxic, Ubisoft have realised this and are working on fixes as I write this review, these fixes may end up working, but most likely they unfortunately won't. The hit registration is random, sometimes you can hit an insane headshot but more regularly you'd be "hitting" headshots instead. 

I do recommend this game as I want others to experience the joy of clutching a round that keeps your team in the running to win the game or even those close calls where you managed to squeeze out an ace on an overtime match-point round, winning the game for your team. When the game works, it shines.
Jackal scanned u...lion has started his bullshit...u can see ying throwing her candellas...and then a big brolick french dude with a shield as big as a black mans pp will come rushing towards ur ass and then fuze will do his nonsense and sing the song of the mother land.....rage inducing blood boiling game...10/10 would play again...5/10 ign : too much siege not enough rainbow
you have to figure out everything on your own, but hey once you learn how to play this game those countless hours grinding on what to do and what operator to use, it's all worth it. You do need a beefy computer in order to play this game smoothly.
I got shot in the back of the head in spawn by my own teammate because I didn't listen to him exactly.
(He was a 14yr old screamer with no sense of self or any sense of situation awareness) 
 
100/100
In my 600 hours plus of playing this game I can only describe it as a complicated relationship. Getting kills, and winning has never been more satisfying in any other FPS iv'e played. The game play is flawless and I love this game and can see myself putting another 600 hours into it. People complain about the community, and I agree that there is toxic people, but I will almost always find one person who is fun, and or bearable to play with. It took 50 hours to understand the basic game play mechanics, another 50 to somewhat learn the maps, and another 100 hours to feel as if i'm. I am no where close good as I usually place between gold 4 and gold 3, but I find casual to be far more fun than ranked. My only problems in this game lie in the frustration I get when i am spawn peeked, or killed at the very beginning of the round, it happens quite often, and the player is punished for any minor mistake, but that frustration only makes getting 3-4 kills in a round that much more satisfying. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
Still a fun game after all these years... but I will say that you will now encounter a lot more experienced players because of the game's age. Multiplayer will have some toxic players but that is easy to fix with a mute. Also, if you are buying it now I recommend getting the advanced editions with operators and what not because this late into the game it is very grindy to get new operators. Very fun overall.
Die because one pixel of elbow sticks out :^)
Kill whole team as Fuze...it was your team... :  ^)
Accidentally play Recruit :       ^)

This is one of the best games i have ever play thanks for making it i would have spent all my time on fortnite so once again thanks for making a game that gave my life a good experience. (I recommend playing this game)
Over 1000 hours and still going, i really enjoy this game and its so fun. I also enjoy playing with friends but everything tends to get so toxic but its still enjoyable
This game is so epic guys, you need to buy it if you can. It's super fun with friends,i would recommend buying standard edition, you get 20 operators. But the game it's super fun

10/10 - Would get TKed by a toxic Plat kid again



(Also don't waste your money on starter, just buy the full game, comes with all starter Ops)
game has fun gameplay, but its really grindy, like all operators from year 1 onward are all 25k renown each. so either you have to grind or pay money. game rarely goes on sale too which sucks. but if you get all the operators its quite fun.

I bought Rainbow Six Siege, and it was definitely worth the 20 dollars I spent. The gameplay is fun and exciting, the graphics are great, and it’s an affordable price. If you like shooter games with a bit of strategy, buy Rainbow Six Siege.
I'll be honest here, at first I was very reluctant to purchase Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege after watching gameplays on Youtube and seeing how difficult the game was. Rainbow Six Siege is not one of those shooters where you can join a match and dominate easily. For newbies the game can feel impossible to grasp because in Siege you need to be aware of your surroundings all the time and use teamwork to stay alive as you die very quickly compared to those arcade shooters. 

Now I've played a lot of shooters in my time but the shooters I play are mainly arcade shooters like Battlefield, which has a much lower skill ceiling and doesn't require too much time to get good at. The arcade shooters I played also felt much more casual, with the ability for downed players to respawn after death something that doesn't happen in Siege. I decided that I would give the game a try, as I enjoyed Ubisoft's AC series and generally liked their games.

When I joined my first game I was amazed at how awesome the performance felt. I was able to basically max out the game and get 60+ fps, something quite uncommon with Ubi ports. Right off the top Rainbow Six Siege uses an "Operator" system which is basically reminiscent of a class system and it allows you to pick different operators to use. Each operator will have their own weapons and special skills and you unlock more as you continue playing. Each operator feels unique in it's own sense and can bring something different to the table. I'd recommend if you're starting out that you play around with the operators until you get a better feel for them.

The gunplay in Siege feels very nice and fluid, guns sound and feel awesome and will also instant kill you if fired at the head. Gameplay feels very fast paced, something very akin to Counter Strike and the modes are also very similar. Casual Modes include Hostage Rescue, Area Secure and a few others. There is also a Ranked Match that can be unlock after a certain number of wins in casual.

To conclude, Rainbow Six Siege is a fun game whucg you can't expect to just rush in and do well compared to other shooters. The game requires dedication and patience in order for one to master the game. I bought this game on sale for $16.74 NZD and I would highly recommend it at this price as you will not regret it.

Verdict 8/10.
This game is very fun to mess around with friends and kill each other or play statigcally and seriously or both at the same time the game has many aspects to it and is one of the better fps games i have played in a very long time i would definetly recommend this to most people
Lmao, this is actually my smurf account so I'll review based on my main account (1280 hours+).

This "tactical" game isn't that tactical actually, it's just go in, rush, shoot everyone and die, but not the same case if you have the traps on the enemy team. You watch for spawnpeeks every single time for beginners, watch for spawnrush, place claymores in every window since this game is full of run outs. 

For beginners I recommend Jager and Rook for the defending and Thatcher and Thermite for the attacking.

Based from my experience on this game, you will encounter toxic teammates but it's OK, you can mute them anyways.
Also the hitreg in this game isn't perfect so expect some "HOW THE F*** IS THAT NOT A HEADSHOT" moments.
This is indeed the best FPS game I have played so far. And it is also by far the best FPS game to play with friends. I regret not having started playing this years ago.
i am leaving a review on year 4 because i started playing this just last year and got hooked.
always had it from year 1 but the more i play it the more i wanted to get good and learn it and get better.

Honestly it depends on what people are looking for cause every match is different just because of different ops.
Rainbow Six Siege is a great game to play with friends or just for fun. The drive you get from wanting a win or to earn one is so satisfying, and losing helps you persevere and try to win the next round about. With friends, this game is a blast and can keep you playing this game for hours. All-in-all, for a good deal, this game is a great game to get when there is a sale. I would recommend this game with anyone who has friends committed to winning, no matter what their skill set it. 

(P.S. Do NOT GET THE STARTER EDITION!!! If you ever plan on getting this game, getting the Base $40 version is always better. I would recommend waiting for a sale and grabbing the complete edition.)
 In the end though, this game is FANTASTIC, and a steal for its price.
Super fancy and fast paced FPS with lots of new and unique gameplay mechanics/elements. I bought the cheap edition. Not worth it. They definitely try to pump every single dollar out of you that they can in this game. The entire purpose of the cheap edition ( I don't think it's sold anymore anyway ) was to try to convince you that it sucked and you should upgrade ( which requires a entire new purchase not just a small fee ). Don't spend money on their purchasable currency. It's easy enough to play matches and get enough to buy new operators, especially since they don't even charge to buy attachments on weapons anymore. Don't be cancerous in games please, as it is pretty common to find assholes and weirdos- don't add to that population. Plenty of sales to find this game in.
one of the best shooter games you can get on market as of today. it is tactical and not just run and gun. plus ubi made good decision removing standard edition tho i wish they would stop language locking games but other than that game is awesome.
Having played quite a lot of Rainbow Six Siege I decided to give my opinions on it.

I fell in love with this game, and it is, at the moment my favourite FPS that I've ever played. Tactical with close quarters combat is definitely hard to master, as of now, I'm at 350+ hours and still learning. But it is a very rewarding game. Each operator has a unique play style, with their speed/armour, weapons and gadget, which allows for a different experience every time. The numerous maps also allow for different approach on offence and defence. Another thing that i appreciate about Rainbow Six Siege is that, despite this game being released in 2015, it is still being developed, especially with Y4 coming with numerous fixes on items and toxicity within the community. For anybody thinking it will get boring at one point, it really doesn't as this game and the enemies are very unpredictable and there are infinite strats and play styles which will allow for a lot of fun experimenting the game.

I do have to say that, the players are not that welcoming to new players, or even players in general. Ubisoft did address this, creating a Newcommer playlist, allowing new players to learn and get better at the game. Some of the operators, even after all this time are still not fully balanced which, sometimes can really get on someones nerves, but, it is slowly being worked on.

Overall, I love this game and i cannot wait to see how it will be developed further.

4.9 / 5





Great game played it some time... 
TBH only enjoyable with a few mates, as randoms tend to be kinda toxic.
A lot of glitches, but the game gets better every season


One of the best fps games based on operators which have unique and special abilites or gadgets. Undoubtedly one of the best team work games to play in a party of 5. Loads of fun and the pro league is sick!
120 hours and the game stoped working am a 14 soon 15 kid but game stoped working sure take my 134 pounds its fine please help ubi i need help 10/10 game i just need it to work again

I only have < 600 hours played yes, but this isn't the important part.
Heart felt review ahead.
(Note that I am writing this review in assumption that you have seen the gameplay)

Intro: You see, during 2015, Siege was just a tactical shooter with 'operators' that had distinct playstyles. So I picked it up on launch. Make no mistake though, Siege was horrible back then. Around say March 2016 (picked it up again when black ice got out) I picked it back up again, after hearing it has improved. So I grinded through and found some semblance of skill after playing and watching Youtube ( cough* Serenity and his tutorials, later that iceycat).

So I found a clan, it wasn't as such originally but we played pretty well together so we formed one.
2016. Best year of my (gaming) life, honestly. I thought "hey this game is going to surpass CS GO one day' and at the same time I hoped that would not happen so that it wouldn't "trend". (Personally I felt that people buying games just because they are popular and not because of what it is is annoying. And it definitely shows in Siege, will be explained later)

So you might as what do I love so much about this game and why did drop it?
To start off. Siege really did what no other FPS could do.
In Siege, you could do well without having great aim. No I am not talking about great as in shroud but more of those clips where people do very hard flicks, in general.
Why? Because here is the kicker and what I found most people who buy this game do not realize.

In order of importance:  Information, Communication, Teamwork, Aim.
Very generic terms, but let me explain. I do want to state that game sense is a must have for ANY game so it is not stated.


-------------------------INFORMATION----------------------
What do I mean by information? Knowledge of what is going on in the game, and outside itself. (Will focus more on in)
See in any game it is obvious you need to know what x thing can do etc etc, so I would not elaborate on that.
Though one point i want to make there is strats, or strategies. Which do also count as out-of-game information.
Now on to the main point. So what do I mean? Information on where the enemy spawns. Information on what operators the enemy has. Information on where the enemy is and so on.
Now this is such a crucial aspect of Siege is due to Siege's game play and map design / structure.
In Siege there would be two teams, with swapping roles per round. 
A team of attackers and a team of defenders.

The defenders would normally start in a compound, (think like an ACTUAL 4 level building) which would be the main area of action. Attackers would then choose their path of entry from the outside. During the preparation phase the attackers would be in control of drones (See? Information.) that could spot where the objective is, act as a mobile camera and see what strat the other team is running. Defenders would make kill holes, set up traps and reinforce walls. They would assume either an anchor role where they 'camp' in a spot or a roamer role where they well, roam around the map for attackers to kill.

Lets say round starts, 5:00 (can't remember the start time, should be five minutes). 
At this point, what information you have, could dictate what you do. For example, lets say we are playing attackers.
Do I know where the objective is?
If No: Sweep floor by floor, you can't waste any more time.
If yes: How do you plan to enter?

Your plan of entry would be largely dependent on how the defenders manipulated the map, your team's operators and your enemy team's operators.
To give a very simple example, if they had a pulse surely you wouldn't just walk in normally.                    

And for the defenders they would normally take a look at the cameras to see where the attacker spawn.
(Assuming they want a spawn kill)
Did they see my broken window?
If Yes can I run fast enough to another spot to get a kill?
If No would I get killed?

The match progresses and you are playing as a roamer, you checked the cameras and see that there is an enemy on the other end of the building, but not too far away from you.
So what do you do?
That would depend on the information you have.
Is there anyone near him?
Can I kill him from a safe distance?
HOW do I get to him? (Safest route, any escape routes?)

All these micro and macro decisions, have to be made with information. 
With information, you don't need to have great aim. You just need to hold the right angle in the right place.

As such, anything that can give you information is a great help and very important. ( I like playing valkyrie for this reason, many ways to set up her camera)
This would move on to my next point.

-----------------------Communication---------------------
Lets switch roles, you are now the anchor. (to be fair most of the camera checking work is done by the anchor at the start, assuming the anchor doesn't hold angles where the enemies will breach at the start)
You check cams, you are on first floor, you see an enemy by himself on the other side of the map. 
However as the anchor you cannot move. You do know your roamer is there, but on the second floor.
So you tell him by either using comms or a ping.
You tell him exactly what you see and what the enemy is doing. (Giving him INFORMATION)
Your roamer now knows the situation and will access it accordingly, as stated above. (most likely going for the kill)

However, because you gave such accurate information, not only did your team get the kill, your roamer is safe.
How? You told him there is someone else guarding the stairs. So instead of going down, he killed the enemy through the (opened) hatch.
Surely you don't need to have great aim to kill a slow moving target that isn't even aware of your presence do you? 
See where I am getting at?
This also transitions into my next point.

---------------------------Teamwork-----------------------
Communication multiplied.
I can give a really easy example, you can ask anyone out there, they wouldn't disagree.
Because I am/was in a clan, some things would be done without even talking to each other. We all knew what strats we were going to run on certain maps. We were able to complement each other's strength and whatever information we had.

What I mean by strats could be as simple to defender preparation to something such as sequenced actions for the attackers. (Kill hole, breach, flash, kill from above, etc etc) Things that you really need to practice together to get it right.
Coordinated attacks, a tactical approach.

So my last section, which would also include my semi-rant.

----------------------Aim------------------------
if you cannot tell, from what I have discussed, knowing what to do is the most important in siege.
Personally, you only really rely on your aim if something else happens. 
Else, you should be droning in to rooms first. If not, lean and sweep the room. (If you are an attacker / roamer that is).

The maps on siege are so easy to aim. The floors are so even, you could easily guess where heads would be after a few hours playing. Rarely you had to aim in odd angles such as a diagonal XYZ. 
This would lead to my "rant" section. And why I feel this shouldn't have been 'trended'.

Most people buy this game, most likely because of one or more of the following reasons:
Wow, many people play, must be good. I buy.
Wow, operator have sk1llz. I buy.
Wow, one bullet to head, no matter the gun. Die. I buy.

They don't realize the beauty of this well constructed and put together game.
In Siege, none of that ultra glory shit matters. Only the win.
You can very easily get 3 kills and still lose due to poor communication.

I hope after reading this review, you will not become one of them. 
Rather, buy and appreciate this game for what it is.

So what should stop you from buying the game? The hitboxes and your commitment.
(As it is such a tough game)
I would recommend this game. Its hard to get into and learn everything in the game. I would recommend this game to people who want to feel acomplished by learning. I have over 80 hr and im still learning new things from friends or randoms people who you meet. This game is also very fun to play with friends.
Siege is currently my number one played game on Steam. I preordered the game way back in ye olden days, and participated in the closed and open betas. I have every operator currently available (assuming the Aussie ops aren't out yet) and let me tell you, this game is a blast. No pun intended.

Take the following paragraph with a grain of salt, because I argue in favor of operators seen as weak (like Capitao) and my favorite map, Yacht, was removed for about a year - give or take - because it was seen as unbalanced. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, there are no operators that are excruciatingly unbalanced one way or another. Sure, there are obvious ones where their ability is a must-have (Rook, Thermite/Hibana/Maverick) or their weapons are so good they get picked because of that - such as the beautiful German M870 and the glorious Russian SASG-12 auto-shotty - but I rarely have an issue with an operator. Sometimes, when they are introduced or buffed, they can get a little stupid-good like Blitz when they accidentally made him speed racer and ruled the game for a week or two, but eventually, they end up fairly balanced. The maps are generally pretty good. There are a few outliers, like Bartlett U. which can rot in terrorist hunt, but surprisingly their earlier maps tend to be better, or at least more loved.

Overall, this game is amazing. And it's even better with friends. Not only because communication is very powerful, but because of the antics you'll get up to and the insane tactics you'll use as a group. In one of my Discord servers of friends and friends of friends we once got a 5v5 private game together and whoo boy it was hectic and hilarious.

Oh yeah, protip: there's a profanity filter. If someone tries to get you to say racial slurs in chat, don't. Even different spellings (like replacing gg with bb in the middle of the word if you catch my drift) will get you a temp-ban.
A pretty fun and challenging game.
Yes ofc there is some people that are trolls and toxic , but most of them are pretty cool people! I recommend to play this game with a group of friends otherwise it's not that FUN.

Also : The Graphics are pretty fkin good i must say, and it's really realistic in my opinion!
That's all :) Buy IT and go BLOW UP some Walls and Floors!! <3
I bought the game yesterday, wanting it for a little while and it was finally on sale. I have played 6 hours at this point and I´m absolutely loving this game, it´s original, works great and is optimised very well. My PC is pretty bad. I can run medium easily with 50-60fps when discord, chrome etc. are all running. I recommand trying it for free as long as that lasts, if you are going to buy it buy the Deluxe Edition, only 2 euro's more and you will get more characters.
hi ubisoft i like your game rainbow six siege known as siege i  just want to ask if you can maybe make acog scopes back as it has been it would be nice if you did that hopefully you see my mail im writing now hopefully you could do it thanks!
not experienced alot only 8 hours into the game but i like it so far its not very easy to learn it took me 5 hours to learn basics i still didnt get everything , also maps are very hard to learn so if ur the last man standing u can miss it up and get  kicked for not knowing what to  do , but i like it
The mechanics of this game are very nice. It is a shooter at its core, but there are a few things that differentiate it from other shooters, such as gadgets, drones, and abilities. There are 3-4 gamemodes, all consisting of one team attacking another, and there are about 30-35 ish operators/people to play, split up into 2 groups: offense and defense. You play offensive characters when you are attacking, and defensive when you are defending. All of these operators have different gadgets you can use to your advantage. In the round, you can also use drones and cameras that you can use to spot other people.
I must say this game is one of the best multiplayer games that I have found( I haven't found many though),but is better to play it with friends. Great game 9/10
This game is a good logic and strategy based game, if you play it how it was meant to be played.  Most of the time, no one really plants the defuser, and if they do they immediately get gunned down by a defender sitting behind a deployable shield. Also, beware of the toxic players that try to get to you, or else you will become one as well. This game is fun when you figure out how it works, so I really recommend this game to people getting into the game, especially the ones who are looking for a good FPS game.

A good game to play if you wanna get killed in the first few seconds of the round by an asshat abusing broken mechanics that wont get patched until 6 months later.

Good game, bad community.
you had enough of csgo 

Introducing rainbow Six Siege

You wont believe that YOU CAN ACTUALLY AIM DOWNSIGHTS,GET SKINS FOR PLAYING THE GAME(you can just buy some packs with R6 credits)and its just a game like csgo but pretty expensive
*2nd last person on your team dies
Last person alive on your team: "Where was he?"
All 4 spectating teammates: "HE'S THERE, OVER THERE!"
GAME OVER
10/10 Would play again
I guess it was worth the purchase, it's exceptionally fun with friends. If you have good aim in the first place, it may set you above certain players BUT the abilities in this game is what puts a stop to just straight domination from players who don't react fast enough or aim good enough. Very fun though, very fun.
Pros:
- allow you to use wall hacks on some operators
- drones are very fun to play .. run your drone and put on shelf near enemies
- shooting the enemies through the walls
- potato friendly, I use AMD A8 + Radeon R5 M430 it works perfectly on low res (I don't mind to play in lowest res)
- many operators but not over powered.
- peek a boo simulator
- able to make hole in walls and roof. it is awesome.

Cons:
- 80GB !!!!
I absolutely love this game! Even at over 200 hours, it hasn't become stale. I plan to play it for many, many more hours. I bought this game as a Christmas gift for two friends and they seem to love it, too. It is better with friends, but it is just as fun by yourself. I totally recommend this game, and I hope to see you out there!

Great game, very fun and non toxic community. Would totally recommend ranked as the community is very accepting of new players and will help you out if you make mistakes. If you are looking to meet some new great people who aren't going to yell into their mics or insult you I would suggest this game.
Touted as having the best community for competitive games as according to reddit. Blame it on reddit if you get me and my shooters on your team. Fuck reddit and fuck you.
239.2 hrs on record
POSTED: FEBRUARY 2
Siege is by far my favorite shooter. It's not even close. This is an incredibly difficult game for an FPS, but the payoff is well worth it. At about 100-150 hours of play I felt like I generally understood all the maps, the tactics and meta for each, and the play mechanics; at about that point it starts to become an FPS that makes all others obsolete. I completely understand that the grind time is a huge barrier to entry, so here are some suggestions to speed it up:
1. Study the maps as much as possible and know the layout, player spawn locations, objective spawn locations, and the locations of destructible surfaces. Obviously this will come with experience, but you'll get a massive head start by memorizing this early.
2. Change your expectations; this is not anything like CoD or Battlefield. You might not get a kill for the first 10 hours of play. You might not have a positive KDR for 50 hours. You might not get MVP until 100. All of this is fine, because this is a **hard** shooter. Expect that you're going to perform awfully for a while, but that it's going to feel really, really, really good when you start hitting your milestones.
3. This is a teamwork-based game. Use a microphone if at all possible, or at least type in chat, and communicate with your team. If you're dead, watch cameras and call out positions to your team. This also helps you learn the names of the rooms and gets you accustomed to the routes players will typically take.
4. Pick operators you actually like playing. Don't just follow online guides' suggestions on which operators to unlock--read about and watch footage of operators and pick the ones you're excited about. Just want to play the starters? That's totally fine, Thatcher and Jager are two of my absolute favorites. If you stick to ones you enjoy, you'll enjoy the game that much more.

On the flip side, the community is not great. There are a lot of toxic players who can't handle loss, have no patience for new players, or just want to make someone's day suck. Don't let them get to you and use the voice/text chat mute features as much as you need. If they're getting really out of hand then just report them.
The Renown system (the currency you buy operators with) accrues really slowly, so if you're okay with in-game purchases, buying some Renown to get some operators more quickly might help. Personally, I think forcing myself to play my new operators until I'm able to unlock a new one helps me get proficient all my unlocked ones, but that's my opinion.
The ranked system isn't perfect, but it's a cool way to take the experience up a notch when you get pretty good at the game. Don't stress out about it too much, plenty of players only play casual.

This really is a fantastic game when you put the time into it, and it's up to you if that's an investment you want to make. As long as you understand that it can be a grueling process in the beginning, potentially 100 hours until you're proficient, and that the community can be exhausting, I say take the leap.
20/10 for upgrading the starter edition people to the old standard edition set up this was one main reason i never played on PC cause to grind to half the cost of a DLC operator for a base game operator is nuts and i feel more joy playing the PC version for the fun moments with other players and the hilarious random moments that occur with friends. I just may drop $80+ for all the operators on here for how often I'll be playing PC.

I know it seems weird to complain about the grind when this was gifted to me but still the fact that you used to pay $20 and then have to fork out more cash for the rest of the base game operators right away did take the fun away especially if people can only afford the starter edition. kudos to team rainbow for making a wonderful tactical team shooter and I hope this game will continue to grow to that goal of 100+ operators
This is just a really fun game. But when you start playing the game in the start. It can feel a bit irritating because, you'll maybe die and die aaaand die. 
Buuuut. After some time, and when you het the hang of it. It can get enormously rewarding.

So just give it some time.
I have a gun. You have a gun. I have a defuser. You have a bomb. You have a hostage. I need a hostage.  You have a case. I want that case.  What happens?  apparently nothing but death and ragdolls for 30 minutes.

but seriously it's a good game
somehow no majorly bad experiences with the community
well there was one

teamkilled one person, I put him down, he spammed keybinds and he left immediately

but still good game
all i could say about this game is that it's amazing the graphics are neat and about the gameplay it's pretty fluid and correct, about price of the operator they are mostly correct and all of the have their own abilities plus the radial gameplay style is taken foward by the gameplay that be done by demolition of the environement wich give people many kind of tactics to approach  the game for the last thing 

you can blow your enemies ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Got to this game by friend recomending it to me. First I got killed many times, had no idea what i was doing and pretty much got called with bad things.
But i liked the game so i started playing with friends and after some weeks i got a lot better and now i really enjoy playing this game. I really like it because you have to be carefful and mostly think before you do something. You have to defuze the bomb or defend the bomb. You can destroy walls, baricades and lot of things and just everything for me is fun but only one thing isn't and thats the community. There are lot of people who are toxic but now i don't really care about them and just enjoy the game.
Got this from a mate. Really good game, one of the best of all time. Love that you don't have to buy the DLC:s to experience everything. (All the maps are unlocked for everyone and you can grind the ingame currency to buy DLC operators.) Overall, the best game I have played. 11/10 would play again.
Yeet, I had the starter for this game which I paid for, then decided that I wanted to upgrade to get operators quicker ended up not being able to upgrade instead I had to delete the starter which I paid full price for and then also have to pay full price for the gold edition that I purchased which is abit of a joke but meh game is good.
I just want everyone to know that a user named Owen1994 was banned without warning and had to jump through hoops all because his name had "n1994" in it, which some idiot dev thought spelled out something other than his birth year. That is a perfect summary of the game at this stage. 

It was great when Jackal and Mira came out. Now they messed with textures and controls that didn't need to be messed with while having the freaking ubi gestapo come after you if you say one of 2,000 no-no words.
I really wanna give this a reccomended but I won't because of the bureaucracy ubi has been slowly inserting into the game with each successive update, and also for their extremely rude customer service and responses. 

I preordered the tachanka figure the day it was announced; a few weeks later the price was reduced, and I was emailed a gift code that was NON-FUNCTIONAL. 

There is also no way to refund or trade skins or charms so if you unbox something you don't like, you're stuck with it. At the very least it wouldn't hurt to include an option to exchange what you unboxed for credits, or implement a 3-use lifetime refund program. Would it kill Ubi to think of their consumers every once in a while?

hours at time of writing: 676 hours
Ubisoft really took the L. Censoring swear words in a game for people aged 18+ really shows how Ubisoft is trying to squeeze every part of SJWism into this game. Banning people for saying words like nibba or negro just shows the insecurity of the whole team. Now after the newest update this game just went from bad to worse. Removing skulls, gambling (note that real-money and ingame-money gamble alpha packs are still being promoted), things that hint to sexual content, the melee symbol (from knife to fist) and even blood textures on walls  just to earn even more money from the chinese market because those things are banned there? I really enjoyed the game, I looked past the bugs and the matchmaking system that is still in beta after 3 years but censoring so many parts of the game just to be politically correct and earning as much money as possible? No thank you Ubisoft, I don't need that shit in games.

EDIT  21/11/2018: Ubisoft just stated that they will reverse the changes. This was only achieved by the community outcry. This review will stay negative just to show the devs and Ubisoft, that even the idea of global censoring is stupid.
Ubisoft is censoring the game for all of us to appease china and acting like thats a good thing
Edit: and removes discussions concerning this BS from the discussion boards even if they arent toxic....
Edit2: also it will make a return of the outbreak mode impossible
also no return of a vegas map in the future
All hail the PRC i guess... guess i wont buy the season pass after all
Edit3: seems they rethink the changes and dont want to apply the shit to all of us, if they indeed do that, well at least they listened, doesnt completly negate it (after all they wont make the stuff i wrote under edit2 now) but still better than the BS they wanted to do before
After the implementation of the chat filter this games feels like joke. I feel like I am back in a kindergarden where teacher is watching you. Game needs to be fixed, ranked is still in beta and they care about "bad" words which some of them are discutable like  "coon"(raccoon, animal). Game contains killing, bombs and terrorists and developers cares about bad words. The filter does not even work correctly!
Used to love this game, but since Ubisoft had decided to censor the good stuff instead of fixing bugs and glitches, I cannot recommend this anymore. (There were so many changes that I didn't like or agree, but this time it is ridiculous. )
I really wish I could recommend this game but I can't, not because of Ubisoft servers or balancing issues and whatnot, but I cannot possibly recommend this game's community. I am not a ranked player and rarely play ranked gamemodes in any game and have only been ranked once in Rainbow Six. That being said I only play casual and I can't even play 2-3 games in one sitting without becoming extremely burnt out due to the toxicity and ridicule laid out by this community. I find myself extremely stressed in every game I play because of how this community treats low skill players like myself. This game is by no means beginner friendly and every mistake minor mistake you make will cause at least one person in the game to harass you for the rest of the match. I only come back to this game for the exciting and enjoyable gameplay itself, but I am constantly turned away by its unrelenting community.
Bought the game recently. Played 4 hours in a premade 5 people team and it was much fun.
Played the next day alone and this are my first 4 matches:

1) Hacker in my team who teleported outside as defender in the first second and killed everyone before their could even spawn. After the match he made adverts to his hacking device and called his youtube channel so we could see that he is not banned in 3 months even with his videos as proof that he is cheating (he called it "social experiment").
2) I took "twitch" because I needed a french operator, a guy in my team wanted twitch too so he and his 2 premades (all similar name) teamkilled me every round in this game. I reported them (and the cheater in the previous game) but I dont think it has an impact
3) Next game with new people I tried to hit a drone but a teammate walked in front and I hit him in the leg (for about 20-30hp) he truned around and instantly killed me...
4) I am lvl 12 and now playing with 3 friends (also all about lvl 12) against 5man premade with lvl over 150 each and platinum rank, they check our level and start insulting us that we are noobs before the match beginns. Kill cam they t-bag us...

I have seen toxic communites before, but this... This is next level.
I dont say "dont buy this game" but be ready for this if you are playing alone or do have toxic or cheating enemies. 

I tried to refund this game but I CANT! Because I played the free weekends and the timelimit is more than 2 hours for me from the beginning! STEAM I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
This is the most toxic community I have ever seen. My team voted to kick me because I was new and then TK'd me when they only got 3/4 votes to kick. Tried playing again with different people and it was somehow worse. The game is super cool and I really wanted to enjoy it but until ubi does something about that high toxicity level I would advise staying the hell away from this.
Toxic players means I have no desire to learn the game. Might be fun if you have 4 friends to play with but that's too much effort just to enjoy one game.

Being able to pay to unlock stuff faster is always a big negative too.
love the game, but i hate the matching system, lvl 16 matched with bunch of veteran players with lvl 100-ish seriously, basicly every game i joined will end up losing or win with my stat 0 kill and 6-10 deaths. thus i cant learn the mechanic and will get rape everytime. oh, people always scream and called me names coz my lvl 16 play skill didnt met their lvl 100ish standart play skill. for now i cant recommend this game until they make a match system for new players
The game is fun to an extent, but issues I see are a lot of hackers and stuff now. Also kinda bummed but upgrading to a better version of the game, or you know, actually having the ability to buy characters through steam. Yea about that guys. Waste of time and space. UPlay went and made the game look like crap compared to the original showings, and the community went and turned it into a meme. 


A FPS game with completely new game style. Loved it. BUT--- EXTREMELY TOXIC environment. TK for fun even in ranks. Cyber bully. Too many ignorant kids taking toxicity as fun. Cannot have a single night without having TK happening on my team.

Not going to play anymore.

I want to love this game so much but the performance problems (100% cpu/gpu bug) in addition to unresolved problems with crashing have forced me to give this a negative review. The support is generally "we will pass this along" with no actual solutions or fixes for the problems. This game needs its own engine to fix a lot of these recurring problems. That obviously isn't going to happen anytime soon. If you want to see some great example you can watch the pro players crash and disconnect in the middle of matches live on twitch! 

Honestly lets just give them some time, it has only been out since December 1, 2015.
Like S&D in CoD, but slower and less fun.

The longer you play for the less fun it gets. Ubisoft's sh,it client is required to play this game and then when you're actually in the game there's nothing to do. It has "scenarios", casual/competitive and terrorist hunt, all of which are basically the same exact mode. There's like 2 dozen maps and even more classes (most of which are locked behind a paywall like it's a sh,itty F2P game). Since you don't respawn actually learning these maps and general line of sights is impossible unless you sit through boring AI matches in terrorist hunt or just play casual with idiots and smurfs. It's the most dogsh,it game I've ever seen. Unless you're playing since launch there's no reason for anyone to play this game. No new player will look at this and say "YUP this is fine I'll learn how to play this game and have fun doing so", especially not after they see how little ingame currency you actually earn per match and how much they try to jew you in the shop. 5 bucks for a sh,itty charm, 10+ for the first year's OPs, 30 for a sh,itty season pass and you can even pay to boost your ingame currency gain for a certain amount of time. Avoid this garbage game and play TF2 or CoD or anything really, just not this trainwreck of a game with drooling ret,ards as fanbase.
I recently purchased this game because I wanted to join in a few of my friends who play it sometimes, they said any package would be a great deal (except Starer pack which was now gone) since you get the base 20 operators and then if you get the Deluxe pack you get 8 more. Sounds great I thought to myself, plus the game is having a free weekend so there will be a lot of noobs just like me; perfect time to get in! My friends were wrong, turns out, things are not quite as they were. 

Once I downloaded the massive thing I realized that the operators were missing, upon submitting a ticket I was told that they were no longer unlocked by default which is something that the game was praised for over the past year. I was also told that there isn't really a resolution and that I could submit feedback to pass on to the team but I can't get them unlocked because I bought the game 24 hours too late or something. I'm not grinding for 20 out of 28 characters I should have or would've had if not for the dumb change. I wanted to jump into a 4 year old game and have a good time for a few hours instead I ended up getting a refund. Not happy.
I had originally liked the game and had this placed on one of my favorite list of titles. This was the game I liked to start up whenever I had free time or wanted to play with my friends.

The first few things I loved about the game was its hybrid of tactical and first-person shooter. Ubisoft had published their first triple-A title that attracted millions of players in a fast-paced catalog of gamemodes. Multiplayer had three simple options; Casual, Ranked, and Terrorist Hunt. Casual was a simpler and overall quicker version of Ranked which paired 5 players against another 5 in a randomly selected map and gamemode. The three were as follows; rescuing the hostage, planting or defending the bomb, and securing the biohazard.

Room for error was slim and firefights would be relatively short. Players were not bullet-sponges, leaving a small window of opportunity to retaliate if they are caught in a bad position. These are some of the elements that made the game suspenseful and give people just as much power as they were vulnerable. At a previous year, I [b]would've[/b] said this game would be [b]perfect for players[/b] who like a [b]touch of realism[/b] in a game they can quickly start up.

However, at all points in Rainbow Six Siege's lifespan, there always had to be problems that could've been fixed. Except they were not. Let's look at the first year for example, [i]R6S[/i] vets I summon you. Remember how annoying it was to get into a ranked match because you would constantly get a connection error? How difficult was it for you to play with a person from Europe when you lived in the United States, or even with people in a different state? The menu was always buggy, and so were the matches. You had to see what [b]NAT type[/b] you had, because if you were given the wrong one, you couldn't host a lobby for your friends.

I am not a game developer, and I don't pretend to be. However, we are talking of Ubisoft, a company that has a solid reputation of releasing games that were periodically receiving backlash. While they have deviated from the original Rainbow Six Siege series, they certainly had the great idea of a game with specialized operators and portrayed it correctly. But, in essence, for the longest time, they have been allowing people to play an [b]undeveloped game[/b]. If you disagree with me, remember that Rank used to be called "Ranked BETA". I am willing to bet they've done this for the longest time to avoid liability for a broken system.

This brings me to the community. I've only played Ranked for a few times in the past and was scared away from it. In [b]nearly every single match[/b], I was greeted with players that were either toxic, greifer, or cheater. From that point on, after [b]I[/b] got temp banned for retaliating on a team killer, I only dedicated myself to playing Casual and Terrorist hunt. [i]So if you were looking for a more in-depth review on Competitive, sorry. =([/i]

Ubisoft's response to the game-breaking bugs and huge annoyances for the community was [b]Operation Health[/b]. To see Ubisoft improve their game, was a highly plausible thing and I appreciated their show of care to the game. The major problems we had in Year one were almost completely gone. But here's the catch; they took forever. They would cancel their release of a Polish map and delay an operator, due to their slowness of repairing their issues. To this day, I ask what took them so long. I was really bummed out. I wanted to see an Eastern-Europe map. "We already have Skyscraper. Why do we need another map in Asia? It's not even good", I remember saying when Theme Park came out. To make things worse, then comes what I call the [b]Social Justice Siege[/b] update.

I am going to ignore the microtransactions we have in this game. I will ignore the season passes Ubisoft sells to their customers for early access to characters they plan to release. At this point, in a triple-A game, these types of Pay2Cool are to be expected. My biggest problem with Rainbow Six Siege is their team's attitude to controlling the toxicity. The implementation of their chat filter was a very stupid decision for a rated-M game. Their reasoning for this was to ensure their player base was only behaving positively.

These filters banned people for use that were deemed by their automated system as, [url=https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-321200-16/dev-blog-toxicity]"[i]illegal, dangerous, threatening, abusive, obscene, vulgar, defamatory, hateful, racist, sexist, ethically offensive or constituting harassment[/i]"[/url], whatever this means. [b]-> ethically[/b]
Their system was not only ineffective in eliminating the toxicity problem but was also flawed. They refused to accept the harshness of their automated systems (banning people who answered everyday questions with "I am Paki" or "I live in Niger") and, not only that, they demonstrated toxic developer behavior themselves in Twitter posts. Seriously? [i]Good[/i] or [i]Working as intended[/i]?

Wasn't Tom Clancy okay with using phrases like "sand-nigger" and "klukker" in his novels? Correct me if I am wrong, it seems kind of ironic to suddenly have their chats be monitored like [b]Club Penguin[/b]. And on top of that, if they are so uptight about toxicity, why have an operator that does nothing but scream insults? Clash with a shield that shocks people like Twitch, only they can be hidden behind a shield while it happens and recharge at their leisure. So, we're just going to forget about the nerfs to Twitch, Bandit, and Jager?

Then they force players to have 2FA enabled for the ranked matches. Then, they alter the maps. Now, they will be changing their content to allow people in China to play the same game, instead of having to resort to separate versions. While I am not against this because it is China, I am against censoring the iconic things about the game simply because they are banned from viewing from a country. If we even tried to make a game legal in all sorts for all countries, there would be no such thing as Rainbow Six Siege, and that's what the Ubisoft Devs are willing to do. I've stopped playing it and removed it from my favorite list of games to say "no, thank you".

I was hoping for another instance of [b]Operation Chimera[/b] to be released for players. While zombies aren't all that realistic, the whole gamemode was actually decent and fun. I got tired of doing the same thing in each casual match. Terrorist hunt was pretty fun, but that too got boring. Sadly, I doubt they will ever bring that back.

So, to sum this up, there are a couple of things that I did not enjoy about Rainbow Six Siege. I had my fun while the game was taking their steps in the right direction, but then came their downfall. I don't regret buying that game, I really don't. But do I recommend buying the game now in its current state? Not at all. For people who favor more realism, there are certainly bigger alternatives to look forward to. FPS players? Sorry... I am at a loss, but be optimistic. You'll find a really cool game, one day.
Bought this game years ago around Operation Health time, Loved it as the core game mechanics were still present and it felt balanced with a clear skill gap between the noobs and the skillful. This was great motivation to get better and learn how to improve, and within 300h of gametime I became one of the top 3000 players in the world so I feel like I'm qualified to review the game. All of these points are based on the main point of the game, Ranked.

Negatives

>Game has gone seriously downhill with the fact that you could buy they game for a couple of quid meaning hackers and trolls are everywhere.
>Full of Glitches which were gamebreaking in ranked(BETA?!) Like the Blitz glitch and the Doc glitch.
>It makes you toxic without any control, poor performing teammates if you play with ANY randoms at all. The only way to have fun is to play as a 5 or play in Plat or Diamond as people know how to carry their own weight.
>Cheaters everywhere as it can take 20 mins to set up a new account from a Russian website and install cheats.(not as bad as CS)
>Game is mostly about running and gunning since 2018 and has no aspect of a tactical shooter.
>Teamkilling and leavers in most games, leaving you only in the lurch and losing the game no matter how well you played.
>Operator changes every new season, leading to a lack of consistency and still very poor balance.
>The Ranked Elo points are awarded unfairly, although this is more of an opinion, If you get carried with 0 kills and 9 deaths, you earn roughly the same amount of points with someone who has 20+ kills. And Visa Versa If you carry your arse off with +20 kills and lose 4-5, you lose the full amount like everyone else. Although it is a team game, This is stupid as many just throw games with no intention of winning.
>DLC Operators that are OP asf in the first month of their release and then they get nerfed into oblivion as soon as everyone buys them with R6 Credits. 
>COMPLETE censorship, no swearing in an 18 game? no opinions or saying "Retard" when you're talking about a game mechanic or joking around. This is the worst possible tactic to prevent toxicity as now you can only report for toxicity and not for cheaters?! Battle Eye is lazy.
>New maps are so bad as you only win defending rounds as the attackers don't know how to get to the AO.
>Unbalanced maps, Bartlett and Bank should never be near the game for a few examples.

Positives

>DLC operators can be earned rather than always being bought.
>They rejuvenated the game and resurrected it to become successful at one point.
>Was very different to the competition.
>Lots of playstyles with different operatiors

If I reviewed this game a year and a bit ago, it would be a 100% yes but it has changed beyond your imagination and gone full circle.
That is all.
Had 367 hours in the game and absolutely loved it, playing with friends. An experience like no other game provided
Except that i got a banned permanently for cheating, even though i have never done anything
Got banned for having a photo of a man smiling and holding a fat stack of cash. Garbage company and I hope China implodes on itself sooner than later...
This game is full of retarded gross playing spawnpeekers. Dont play this game if you want to play casually, everyones sweating as if they were stuck in some desert.
What a trash game. Over 800 hours and it just gets worse, and worse, and worse. What a travesty of a game. I've been ranked at high gold (3,2, and 1) and after "balancing the game" with 'Operation Health' over a year ago, cheaters still run rampant, servers still suck, head glitching, crouch spamming, and other issues RUIN the game. Every new season and event is a cash grab for people who stick around hoping the game gets fixed. What a shame, it was a good game -- a long, long time ago.
This game used to be good but somethings just crash the game and i hate that about the game this game if its fixed isn't bad but right now the game is absolute shit.
no game has made me want to end my own life more than this game. please do yourself a favor and never touch this god forsaken piece of shit of a game.
This game would be good if it were not for the toxicity every match i get in and to make it worse there is no system in place that works to stop it. Every ranked match I have played in there has been players team killing, leaving early, throwing games, being very toxic in both text and voice chat, sometimes it was all of them and nothing happened when i reported them. I understand it is a competitive game and there is going to be trash talking, but when i'm being constantly harassed in a match for just talking in chat is not okay, plus I have been in a match with a female friend and she was being sexually harassed to the point she left the match.
免责声明：中国玩家因彩虹6号更新受外国玩家唾骂
The non-responsiblity disclosure for Chinese Rainbow 6 Seige players due to the latest Ubisoft R6 update to pass the game censorship of Chinese government
【English/Chinese Translation 语法单词修正版v0.1 觉得好可以转发】

致亲爱的育碧,Dear beloved Ubisoft,
赚钱没有什么错，丧失你的尊严令人唾弃。
Making money is not wrong, but abandoning your dignity is not respectful.
和腾讯合作进入中国市场，并不会给你带来更好的名声。
Cooperating with Tencent Games in China for entering the market of the mainland of China won't give you better reputation.
我们玩家知道，改不改游戏是育碧自己的决定，与任何ZF，玩家没有直接关系。育碧这么做完全是出于中国腾讯股份投资吸引来发展大陆市场。
We all know that Ubisoft updated the R6 all from its own decision. No government, company or players force Ubisoft to do so. The reason why Ubisoft changed the R6 to pass the game censorship of China is that Tencent recently bought 5% of their stocks on market and lured them to set seperate game servers physically located in the mainland of China.
我们不需要中国服务器。我们可以玩加速器。我们拒绝为这一变化承担责任。
We don't need a server located in China. We can play R6 with network accelerators. We refuse to take any responsibility for the new update in Rainbow Six Siege.
我们真的很热爱这个游戏，真的，真的不希望对此作出改动。
We really love this game, and we really, really don't want this thing.
我们不想熟悉的地图就因为这些事而被改动。
We don't want the map which we're familar with be changed into this because of Chinese government's censorship.
在主题乐园这张地图中，位于正门二楼窗口的一台赌博机上面保留了一个玩家的信息彩蛋，我们不希望因为改动而让这个彩蛋消失
In the map called "Theme park", a gambling machine on the window of the second floor of the main entrance hides a player's information, and we call it the in-game eastern egg. We don't want this in-game eastern egg disappears because of Chinese government's censorship.
在中国，游戏中受伤是不能出血的，如果有，也不是红色。希望UB不要对此作出改动
For those games in China, it is not allowed to show injuries with bleeding. Or if you want bleeding, the blood should not be in red. Hopefully, UB won't make any changes.
如果是为了在亚洲更好销售，我恳请制作亚洲特供版。谢谢。
If UB wants to have better sales in Asia, please make a special Asian edition of R6 and don't change the original one! Thanks.
请不要把我们这些爱好者抛弃。
Please don't abandon us, lovers.
They have a great game and ruined it with overly aggressive micro-transactions and unbalanced online play.

If they made a complete single player game with this level of polish it would be well worth the money.

Ranked is BROKEN and Ubisoft is doing FUCK ALL to fix the problem. 4 years and ranked is still in beta, nice one.  

[h1]Problems[/h1]

- Teammates leaving (what are u gay?) 

- Meta whores (ubisoft's problem due to balancing operators)

- Matchmaking (It's ok Ubisoft like every other game ur matchmaking is just as shit as others) 

- Operators (again fucking balance them ffs) 

- Glitches (crouch spamming ash retards) 

- MMR (unrealistic mmr point to diamond when there are fucking mountains of problems with the game and u expect typical good players to even have a chance at hitting diamond?)

- Maps (stop giving ranked players shit unbalanced maps) 

[h1]How to solve the game for Ubisoft[/h1]

- Fucking make ranked like PL settings like it should be

- Solos can only play with solos, duos with duos squads or maybe max solos,  ONLY with squads (fucking 5 man vs solos, GLHF) 

- Sell Rainbow6 to literally any other game company.
for first time its s look like good game and even best shooting game in world when u play more and more and more and rank up u see new bugs new cheats new cheater bad servers back net and and and so on... really tnx ubisoft (ubibug) for this 
every updates = new problems
new season new bugs :)
This game is awesome and I loved it , until I started playing ranked.
The community and the matchmaking system just fucks everything up.
There are more smurfs in this game then in csgo.
Even in casual you only have a slight chance that you will match up againts those who have almost the same rank as you.
Its just dumb and makes the game unenjoyable.
I've been playing since 4 days straight and you cant rank up but you also cant rank down. (stuck in Gold since 2 seasons)
The matchmaking system is just bad , but the community as just toxic as it can get.
You got the diamond guys who play in gold and say "EZ" at the end of the game , you got the last guys who got carried the whole match and say "ez" at the end. 

If you buy it , and you're lucky you will enjoy it for like 100-150 hours. 
I could go more into the "why is everything wrong with the matchmaking" thing but my english isn't perfect and im starting to get bored writing this shit.
In conclusion: 
Game: good (if we dont count the bugs)
Everything else: bad
Sorry for my shitty english and if you have any questions write it down in the comments or add me.
This isnt any of steams fault but it still hurts the game. What am I talking about???
GODDAMN UPLAY. So many times has this "launcher" ruined a day i couldve been play siege but instead I'm trying to fix their launcher so that the game i bought fcking works. its 2019 and this is still like this. I stopped playing this game for about a year because of this BS.
I admit this game is really great. But many seasons has already passed but Ubisoft still can't deal with the Hackers. Its frustrating to work hard to rank up because you only get defeated by a hacker when you meet one and you can't do anything, absolutely nothing. There isn't even a report for hacking in the game. Makes me think that Ubisoft doesn't permanently fixes this issue because if a hacker gets banned, Hacker buys a new account, because the reality is that these hackers are getting paid by people for boosting them into higher ranks. 2 factor authentication didnt solve anything either. I've played considerable number of hours (1,700 plus hours) and i always play rank. After the ban wave last time i thought this will be it, the new siege ranked without hackers. But its here again, hackers are everywhere, im guessing because you only need to be LVL 20 to play rank 😑 I will recommend this game if they find effective ways to reduce and discourage hacking.
i would not recommend this game. it is basically the second CS:GO. trolls, screamers, children (-16 y/o) the game itself is nice but the community ruined it
Very bad support. After buying the game I did not receive the operators I was supposed to. Opened a support ticket and decided to refund after 10 days without a response.
One of the single worst purchases I ever made on steam, and that's rivaling the likes of DayZ.

Not only was I basically scammed into buying the starter edition with permanently gimps my ability to get any characters, the game itself tends to go downhill the more updates that come out, between Dev's being completely incompetent and the community being no better. all this terrible stuff to sift through, all to occasionally play with my friends.

I'm not even going to go into specifics, because frankly that would deserve an entire series of videos going in depth with how much in this game is ruined by the people working on it, and how the community tends to eat it up like candy.

If you are going to get this game, make sure you have friends to play it with, and avoid the starter edition at all costs.
Got the standard version of the game, but with "Starter" requirements for unlocking new operators (it takes between 150 and 200 "terrorist hunts" to unlock ONE year-2 operator. It can take anything between 15 hours to 30 hours to unlock 1 operator that isn't from year-1... classic bait & switch. Game itself is good, but Ubisoft is a greedy developer, buyer be aware. Purchase at your own risk.
Don't buy it unless you're ready for endless toxicity and a constant flow of bullshit. Most of the basic mechanics of this game are super annoying to deal with on their own.
I've played this game a crapload, and after all that time I have had my ups and downs with this game, but finally I have a verdict. 

Even though the game play is good and the graphics are amazing I cannot recommend this for any new players trying to learn the game for three main reasons. 

1. There is little to NO matchmaking in casual, the game has sacrificed finding players that match your skill level for queue time speed. Meaning that you either stomp, or get stomped when you play casual. 

2. You cannot choose your spawn in casual, meaning that you can never plan ahead for tactical gameplay (as this game so proudly advertises).

3.Playing ranked has become a pain in this ass. Honestly, I'm all in for data security and protecting players' accounts, but asking every single sad fuck playing your game to set up some stupid ass mobile authenticator in order to play ranked, now that's where I draw the line, did for Steam already.

Disclaimer: I will not be changing my review until the issue is resolved.
Gameplay is great nothing wrong with the base game itself, however, I PURCHASED the standard edition which comes with 20 ops. I launched it a little late due to being on vacation (how they did not anticipate this kinda stuff idk) and FOR some reason I started with just recruit. I have contacted them 7 times since Friday and still the issue is not resolved. THEY SAID THEY WOULD GET MY OPS IN 48 HOURS. I'm sick and tired of their garbage customer service
Well, it took a very long time to get this game. I have played a lot on Xbox and I do know how fun this game is. When I built my new pc I knew I had to get Rainbow because of its one of the better shooters out right now. The game had a mega sale and I thought it is my time to buy it. I bought the standard edition and I instantly started downloading it. I was so excited to finally get playing. After about 6 hours of downloading it was finally done! I got on and boom, I had no renown, no defenders nor offensive only recruit. This was very confusing and my friends wonder why this happened. I'm beyond mad about this because I can't join a single game without being kicked for being a recruit. If I wasn't kicked, people would just shoot me and I never got a chance to play. I understand this community is kinda salty but so are all the other multiplayer games. This kicking and team killing process happens every time I would join a new game. I soon had to get my friends to join so they could protect me and decline the kick. I'm so confused, I might have gotten the wrong version I'm not sure. But I do remember going on steam and clicking on Rainbow 6 siege standard edition. If someone could maybe tell me what has happened that would be great.
complete garbage game, crashes all the time. Game is full of lean spammers and crouch spammers. This game is pixel peaks and random prefires to win games, dogshit ass game.
BattlEye what? I see cheaters in all competitive matches and some casual games too. Until companies take this issue more seriously and actively pursue undetectable hacks (yes, they exist for the right money, go figure...), I encourage everyone to avoid PvP on PC.

The PC platform has grown so much that for nerds like the ones that create these hacks, it has become a very profitable way of making a living. Hence, why all companies should step up and fight this issue that is actively hurting their products. 

GTA Online is a cheater fest.

Rainbow Six Siege is a cheater fest.

Apex Legends is a cheater fest.

The Division dark zone is a cheater fest.

Battlefield 3 was a cheater fest last time I checked years ago.

And the list goes on and on.

I don't support services like PS+ nor Xbox LIVE Gold, but at least, in my experience, my time playing on PS4, was without any kind of cheating. Go figure why! Maybe it's because it's a closed enviroment without access to the kernel? I don't know!

Instead of protecting your fucking games with DENUVO, you should start protecting your fucking games against external code injections or whatever. I'm sure people would buy more games that way. No better adverstiment than a cheater free enviroment.
Wait until Ubisoft fix their server then u buy
Fk this stupid game server remove me when winning
This game got a reward every year [Rubbish of the Year]
I play this game since Season Dustline Y1S2. The Game was perfect. It made so much fun. I played it at least 4 hours a day. Since Year 3 it was getting worse and worse at every update. The Operators are getting uncreative, stupid not understandable nerfs are comming out every season.
I applied for a refund.
To be honest,RAINBOW SIX has a really outstanding game design,every champion has their unique skill,a part for it, i can also  modified the gun,using the device to locate enemy position.it give me a different experience of FPS game,but because of this complicated game style ,the players have to use more time to adapt this game compare to other games(cs go).
the problem occur on the community,when i started the first game , our team got 2 mark and the enemy team same ,my teammate open his mic and blame me ,saying something like "i know that he is new to the game,but i really want to kill him" ,then he team kill me ,i even don't know press which bottom to open my mic,i know than i am not playing this game very well ,but i still got 3 -4 kill ,and i am not playing ranking match. i tried few game after it,but it has team kill on our team or enemy team ,when " i still have a long period of rookie with this kind of community "come up to my mind , i press on the bottom of refund...
An esports-ready FPS game without personal profile which should has different kinds of stats shown and match history which should let players download replays of history matches. Besides, the portion of time spent waiting is large compared to that of actual gameplay. Until the game improves on those matters, I will not recommend this game.
The game mode its Not that bad at all 

The things that sux its: 

-Sounds sux rly hard in this game
-Hitboxes are just broken
-They changing every season the recoil of Weapons
-MATCHMAKING is just broken af, if you play Casual you have to play against damn fucking PLAT or Dimond Ranked guys
-the servers are located at Burundi (Africa) 
-And ofc is Ubisoft, they rly doesnt care about players all they want its Money 
-The ranked system is still BETA after ~4 years 

so if you want to rage all the time you can buy this game :D !

i literally can't play it, i mean i don't have god-tier internet, my connection is a bit below the average for gamers, but for most games it works perfectly fine. but for some reason, anyone on ubisoft's servers with over 300 ping find this game unplayable, and going over 500 ping results in an automatic kick, despite having attempted over 200 times across about 4-6 months, i have yet to complete a game, and have only completed the first round approximately 3 times before being disconnected due to "bad network connection." for the record, titanfall 1 and 2's servers are so wonderfully efficient that the game is readily playable on 6-700 ping with only minor rubber-banding, and even shoddy games like heroes and generals (avoid that game like the pay-to-win plauge it is) are readily playable at 500 ping, if not entirely enjoyable. couple that with the already depression-inducing matchmaking times for people with internet of any caliber makes this game my second most regrettable download ever (heroes and generals is the proud holder of first)
Literaly the most triggering game ever. I have played it for a long time, but the more updates came the more bugs. There also was a significant increase in toxicness over the 2 years I played. I switched from PS4 to PC and thought I wouldn't have to deal with 9 year olds yelling or saying "I'm gonna fuck your mom", but no, it only got worse. 

So if you get triggered easily like me, don't buy the game.
The game is very fun, challenging, and satisfying. There is a high learning curve however and it takes a while to get used to , though it is worth it.

However I cannot recommend this game due to the fact that it crashes constantly without any error notification. The crashes happen without fail during the first round of every multiplayer match. It's unclear to me if this is due to a recent update or not; however the game is now unplayable due to this crashing issue. Ubisoft customer support has ignored my inquiries into the issue, and I have not found a viable solution after trying everything online. Thus I would recommend that you don't waste money like me.
The game is fun.

HOWEVER, the community is toxic waste in every sense of the phrase, and their automatic banning system rarely ever gets the people who actually deserve to be banned for "toxic behavior". It seems more in favor of banning people who throw out casual insults in chat (which, keep in mind, that this game is a FPS; it's part of the culture.) than people who are actually being bad sports. 

Additionally, the servers are awful. This is doubly true when you take in to consideration that Ubisoft is a multi-[i]billion[/i] dollar company. 

The game is fun, but it's not worth playing. Oh, yeah, and all of the post-release operators are worth more than three times the base game.
So standard edition is the new starter, after raking some good ol' sales with lunar event, they come up with this disrespectful decision to immediately turn the deluxe edition with the base operators unlocked for just about $1 over the old standard edition price, way to rake up some more sales at the expense of whomever bought the game @ lunar sale and can't refund anymore, applause, nice timing, nice strategy, douchebag decision. How about delivering the operators for the people who purchased the standard back then as well? I mean, when you advertise that this-comes-with-that, you're supposed to deliver regardless of when they decide to boot up the game, not within the timefrate you see fit. Scam much.
This game is a HEADACHE... Between constant LAG spikes, game CRASHES and TEAM KILLS... there isn't much room for fun to be had. Hands down the most toxic player base I have ever come across in all my years of playing online multiplayer games. Just stay away guys... Wouldn't even recommend if it was free.
I really think this game is neat and it's fun to play, but it can be challenging y'know. In other topics about the game, I have to unfortunately negatively review this game because I was scammed in the most diabolical sense... Ubisoft is a rotten and corrupt company... This is unbelievably anti-consumer honestly. 

*Update* I paid for THE STANDARD EDITION OPERATORS and It resulted in me ending up with the STARTER edition which is completely unfair.  What a rip off from ubisoft.
I would make a review but the game crashed ten times in a row.

Before you ask the obvious questions :

Yes, the drivers were up to date
Yes, i verified the game integrity
& Yes, i have reinstalled BattleEye


I didn't even got to play the game.
Buy the game, then pay more for the rest of the game because you sure as hell aren't getting those gameplay-altering operators included in the purchase. Justifiable for f2p but this ain't it.

Typical ubishit nickle and diming that for some reason is still accepted as ok in the year 2019
getting old really fast .
only 1 game mode .
1 team defend some object ( bomb or hostage )
1 team atack .
5 vs 5 
always same 40 sec preparation time . 
after about 1 week of game you done with this game
Honestly i would much rather yank my teeth out then play this game anymore. The community is so toxic that you think you stumbled upon a MW2 match back in 2009. Goobisoft cant balance anyone for shit and are more worried about people saying racial slurs than banning hackers. Hit boxes are messed up constantly, Shields are broken for 1000th fuckin time and yet they are still more worried about their pro league/ranked players leaving basic casual players in the dust to get the sloppy seconds. There's no ranking system in Casual what so ever so if you're new and go up against a diamond or a platinum, well tough titties kid cause you just gotta git gud. A game where a headshot with a 9mm pistol can instantly kill a man who is wearing a full kevlar/steel helmet and were six .308 rounds do fuck all against a one armor OP calling it "realistic" *cough cough* invisible poison mines. Just go play Escape From Tarkov.
Buff g36c to make it a decent weapon if devs want more ppl to choose that. Plus why don't include an honor system? Why don't let ppl choose site in casual? It's a game with interesting and unique mechanics, but the devs are incompetent.
Too many toxic players, no good teams, people do not know how to play and not be a complete jerk to new players and criticize the new players for not being any good at the game

The game is fun for a while, but just gets super boring over time, would not recommend for a long term game, especially if you are trying to play with friends.
when i got this game, i loved it soo much. I played it endlessly and it was my favorite game and its amazing. I would honestly say its still my favorite. BUT one day when the toxicity button came out i thought it was a joke. I said "shit" and people were spam banning for a joke and everyone on the other team decided to report me for toxicity. Now im perma banned and i have an ip ban. I would deadass buy a new copy of the game if that meant i could play it but i cant so now im left here and i hate the game for it now.
When this game came out I loved the idea of a tactical squad based shooter but sadly this game was not it. Even after the game turned into what it is I still had loads of fun. But now I can't get into a game with out g-fuel junkies spamming the crouch button and duck, dodge and weaving all around the map. And don't get me started on the community! Majority of the people you find on this game haven't left their deep dark holes in years and constantly shout at you or harass you in the text chat if you don't play exactly to the standard that is set by their twitch streaming idols. 
This game is fun at times ( minus the broken operators that are released every couple of months or so) but the game is at an all time high in toxicity that will turn off more casual gamers and newcomers. 
When you get into a good match with decent people on your team this game is really fun, but I'm telling you when it's bad, it's really bad.

I give this game a 
Steaming pile of Dumpaloo/10
Fix hit registration.
Fix shields.
Listen to the players.
Don't pander to Pro-League even though you both are latched onto each other's cocks.
Find different ways to nerf ops that don't need their gun to become a pea shooter.
Do not allow Muhammad into american servers.
Make destruction and rag dolls server side, not client side.
Update your anti cheat ffs.
Fix high ping advantage.
Accidental TK forgiveness system.
Actually monitor your report system.

And last but not least

Turn this back into a tactical shooter, not an arcade shooter.
The advanced edition does not give any operator and if you ask the ubisoft support they don't do anything other then telling you to wait 24 hours or 48 hours, which is BS i waited for 3 days still no operator
There is 2 things that ruined this game:
1. Ongoing match
2. Fucking long match making time
if you lucky enough, you'll wait for 5 minutes just to enter ongoing match with 0v2 score
3/10 if can refund now, i will do it
The game itself is good but if someone is just starting to play it’s not fun. Playing multiplayer especially casual it’s impossible to find a game that is genuinely fun because in every game you’ll run into smurfs who are playing on new accounts that are low level just so they can be better, also in some cases I aced in a game and my team kicked me for “cheating” when in reality I just did better than them so they took advantage of the obviously broken banning or kicking people from games.
Dont buy this trash game and waste your money
Toxic community 
Shitty bugs 
Bad gameplay and gunplay 
No balance what so ever
When a new operator come its so fucking unbalanced because they wanna make money from new ops
Pretty shit 0/10

Here is some shooters u can play instead of playing this shit
Escape From Tarkov
Insurgency Sansdstorm
World War 3

we need some real respect
you guys have responsibility to give us better Game environment
not just give TX  the agency of RAINBOW SIX

            Rainbow Six Siege is easily one of the worst FPS games I have played in a long time. Siege is filled with a variety of players ranging from sweaty try hards to low life degenerates. This is easily one of the most toxic player communities I have ever been apart of. However, the player base is not at fault for the toxicity of this game. It is very much Ubisoft's fault for this game becoming the cesspit of toxicity that it is. For the following reason, the broken game frustrates many players. Ranging from broken hit boxes, unbalanced operators, unbalanced maps, and my personal favorite, glitches that fly me to the bottom of the map. This frustration due to the broken game that is Rainbow Six Siege, causes much of the player base to resort in other ways to find fun in this game. Easily some of the most common are teamkilling, insta kicking players, destroying friendly equipment, and the toxic chat. Ubisoft is unfortunately too focused on attempting to keep their aging players as well as trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of the game. Ridding toxicity should not be the focus of Ubisoft, rather the broken game and lack of further content should  be considered in Ubisoft's crusade against toxic players.
A shitty unbalanced trash. Getting matched against high level players even if I'm just a casual player. Can't believe I've wasted 20 euros on this crap.
No question about it, this is a triple A game, very good indeed. 

The community is one that leaves something to be desired. The toxic environment that a new player lives in this game is ridiculously stupid and redundant. I understand that the game is competitive, but that can not mean that a percentage of players are extremely offensive and have poor player behavior, newbies are even better than ranked stupid kids, that behave like kids.

A game is based not only on development but also on the environment that enriches it or makes it poor. Although the game is well done, here is my disgust for the insults and bad behavior of some players. They are simply trash
That's it, I'm boycotting. My suspension of disbelief has expired. A new far cry with two black women taking on the world, the division 2 with all women leadership and melee women attackers (men get guns because they're scared I suppose), and now a new R6 DLC drop where the woman operator can bench the weak male defender and the rest of his four squadmates. Women aren't stronger than men. Women don't have as much of an affinity for war. Get over it. Make realistic games.
I honestly tried to like this game, to learn to enjoy it and to overcome the feeling of wanting to destroy everything in site. I couldn't. I just couldn't understand why people enjoy playing this when it's so unbalanced, broken and otherwise poorly put together. This game should have died back in 2016.

- God awful UI design; for example - putting on sights, grips, skins..etc
- The grind to get reown; simply put it's staggeringly alarming how much it's tuned to P2W.
- The game punishes newer players with slow rounds, gameplay and tedious load times.
- Not enough content, feels like this game is just a testing sandbox for Ubisoft to see what they can get away with in terms of not giving a care in the world about the status of their game. 
- Everything in this game is designed to feel like a money grab and it's just disgusting that people fall for it simply because the game was designed to do just that.
- HUGE gamebreaking things like caivera's view model vs what others see when she's behind cover, the rubberband glitch when jumping/walking through a hole in the wall.
- Operators being "balanced" but result in being worse than they even were before thus resulting in those operators not being used.
- Desync issues and HDD cache load times.
- Only (2) defending operators get ACOG sights. Everyone on attacking side uses them and we just get destroyed constantly. So stupid.

TL;DR - If you like poorly managed games with little to no planned direction and development with greedy shekkel counting game devs that laugh contently every time a purchase is made then you'll love this game. You'll love the broken combat and you'll definitely love how long it takes you to unlock anything unless you unlock your parent's credit card first.
Fun game.
Got cucked by the starter edition removal though.
if only i had waited five more days.
#f  #whyyougottadomelikethatubisoft  #reeeeeeeeeeeeee
Sincerely, WaffeNaut
Do not buy that money trap. They consumed all of monkeyland special forces n told us "new operator". Gratz Ubishi huh sorry Ubisoft. I can suggest u some taiwanian blizzards location maybe u make a new operator by the way.
It was Ok game in the begining, then it improved and its just crap. No hit reg, lots of bugs, glitching, matchmaking. Ubi cant fix ash for 4 years in a row yet they nerf other great operators. Im done with this bullshit and regret buying it
Biggest fucking scam pretending it's on sale then changing its total value and amount of operators the next day. Also autistic that you have to launch it through uplay.
I got the complete edition and bought the year 4 pass seperately.

2 days later

ultimate edition included year 4 pass and is cheaper

I got scammed

Trying to return both
I literally got kicked out of a ranked game, and it didn't let me reconnect back. When I restarted the game to try to get back in the game it put me in another match. And for that I got banned. Fix your system.
Do not bother playing this game. You can either spend $$$ to buy operators or grind 15 hours just to unlock one... On top of that, the community is terrible. First ranked game I get in, two teammates go on a team killing spree. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS GAME
YOU ASSHOLES SOLD ME A GAME AND NEVER LINKED MY ACCOUNT SO I HAD TO GET A REFUND - YOUR SUPPORT SUCKS AND ARE COMPLETELY USELESS - I SENT THEM 17 SCREENSHOTS OF MY PROOF OF PURCHASE BUT THEY NEVER LINKED THE GAME TO MY ACCOUNT - PATHETIC USELESS AND UBISOFT GOT NONE OF MY MONEY - HOPE YOU NEVER NEED SUPPORT - YOU ARE SOL!!!!!
Locking most of the content behind a playwall is a bad sign. It makes me feel like I am losing because I am new at the game and I don't have the better gear/characters. I would rather just lose because I am bad, not because I haven't put the 40 hour investment into a game hoping that I will get all of the content promised. Of course, you could just buy the characters because of course thats an option. Gotta nickel and dime people who paid 20 bucks for a game.

This feeling of being low geared is made worse by the game's non functional matchmaking. I was commonly matched with and against people 75-100 levels higher than me. I can't learn how to play if I am getting killed by players who know the game and have all the fancy weapons. If I was matched with new, lowly geared scrubs like myself, it wouldn't be an issue. 

Perhaps this system is used so players pour 50-70 hours in this game and the stockholm syndrome kicks in. "Well, I got 50 hours out of it so it wasn't that bad, I didn't lose much". Perhaps it was used because they saw it used in the popular battlefield franchise. Whatever the reason, it results in a game that is only welcoming to those willing to make the investment of time or money.
this game is great and i love it, but i just can't recommend this game to people.

the community is horrible and it's toxicity is unbearable, people spew racial slurs as if it's a fcking joke, and they tk you for no reason just to spoil the game. especially if you're just starting the game, most people WILL NOT tolerate you and be toxic towards you because you don't understand how to play yet. whether you are playing ranked or casual almost half of the time you'll encounter people who are trolls and say stupid things through the mic just to annoy the hell out of you. from what i experienced ubisoft doesn't really give a fck about dealing with the toxicity and trolls, it's as if the "report toxic behavior" button is only for show. the amount of hackers in game is outrageous, i literally always deal with hackers at least once every time i play this game for the last few weeks. the servers and balancing issues are dumb, and lastly crouch spamming is becoming ridiculous and people always abuse it.

as of lately i could only play siege for a few matches before losing my temper due to the large amount of trolls and toxic people in game, so i do not recommend this game unless you're queuing with a party or you have amazing tolerance for toxic behavior and trolls.
The ever-increasing number of operators and continued stupid sci-fi and unrealistic gadgets has turned this into a truly awful game, as well people spawnpeeking, running out, broken hitreg (looking at you, Glaz). Because of course a ballistic helmet can't fucking stop a 9mm pistol round in this game. Uh huh, sure.
this game is so freaking rigged its ridiclous, if you back talk the game swear on an adult game or even just trying to enjoy yourself it will ducking (not allowed to swear) duck you up the butt cut not to mention this game is dying theyre running out of ideas and the game is no longer fair its whoever has the better ping wins kinda game soon itll become pay to win. ive spent 500 hours of my time playing this game and i regret every second such a useless and stupid game.
Filled with smurfs and 13 year old toxic kids, I don't recommend this game to people who get angry easily. There is a report feature in the game, but that feature is so dog shit, that you would be better off instead to just uninstall the fucking game and let someone else try to deal with the problem because after 3 years, the hacker, or smurf will then be banned and Ubisoft will just be sitting there saying, oh sorry, we were gonna ban that person sooner but we are just lazy mother fuckers so instead of fixing that shit, and banning that player, we were trying to come up with new operators.
This game is a very unpleasant experience, I have found that the only fun thing to do is to mess around in casual because ranked is broken, Ubisoft says its in beta, how in gods name a ranked game mode in beta? Just fix it man. Constant lag outs through servers, I played a game today and my friend lagged out and another 2 of my teammates and the enemy team just started shouting gg ez but we would have easily beat them if we had a 5 man. I join a game and load in, lag out and thats it. I dont even have bad internet or anything, I have a $5300 pc build and the game runs smoothly until the fact of the servers. I was also playing today in casual to warm up and I shot a defender 3 times in the head and it only injured him and i lost the round because of it, and my friend said that he headshot the same defender too but he could have been bluffing, today has been a realization day of what this game is, and what its become. I join a game and I get kicked because a 4 stack is going 3 speeds but didnt tell me? if you do not have a 5 stack this game is unbearable. I dont only just have 200 hours on pc but I have put countless hours into siege on the xbox one and the ps4 edition. This games toxicity is no surprise to anyone but battle eye ban system is a real joke. If you buy this game don't expect a friendly welcome, they do countless of sales so people who dont want to buy the game buy it. I've put countless hours, so many hours into getting angry because of peoples toxicity and being platinum and getting ranked with bronzes. It is horrible. Decent game, but please dont buy it (:
Takes too long to start a round IMO. I come from csgo where each round takes less than 20 seconds to start. But here you have 20 seconds plus 2 minutes long loading screen(for each round!).
I got the Starter Edition of this game because it was the cheapest, and I didn't know it was going to screw me over and not allow me to use more than 4 operators. This game is fun, but I got bamboozled out of like $7 because I didn't know the Starter Edition was stupid and made it so it costed so much just to buy a single operator.
Now, if I want to enjoy this game, I have to spend even more money it, getting the version I thought I was getting in the first place. I see the Starter Edition is not even up for purchase anymore, so I'm guessing many people were just like I was, hoping to enjoy this game, but actually get screwed out of some money. I've played this game a lot on Xbox, and I was really excited to play it on PC, but the fact that I could only play 3 operators made it so I don't want to play it.
Thanks.
Not fun a good game when you are level 17, no clue what you are doing, playing against and with 90's 150's 200's+ who are ranked highly and can shot you one time with a angle that is impossible. So, no don't buy this game unless you are willing to put in the time and effort to learn everything and anything about this game. GLHF
As you can see I have played this game for quite a while.
My advice for you: don't buy it.
Year 4 is about to start and they are still breaking the game constantly. They recently tried fixing an fps issue some people had. Now, after the deployed their "fix" the fps issue persists, but now in addition users of AMD GPUs - like me - are experiencing artefacting, making the game virtually unplayable. So unless Ubisoft learns how to properly code, don't buy this mess if you value your psychological stability.
Game is super bad. Aiming and shooting feels funky. Your characters movement is awkward. The level of customization for your character is none existent and is substituted with gimmicky characters. The games pace is super slow and it could be enjoyable if there were more rounds to play. There's a maximum of 3 to 5 for casual play and 9 for ranked. Never was able to play ranked because the dual authentication requirement is buggy and even if you do it that doesn't guarantee that you'll be able to play it. This game could be better if they changed the amount rounds so the matches were longer.
Played over the free weekend with my friend, who bought it prior. In my opinion, not worth buying. Insanely high learning curve, lots of maps with lots of rooms that make it impossible to learn layouts or callouts at first, casual mode is completely random matchmaking (mixing noobs and pros), no ranked matchmaking until rank 20 (3 days of playing) and horrible hitreg. Also burns my CPU on my Acer Nitro 5 with an I5-8300H. Average high 90s celsius with no reduction when playing on low graphics. In my experience, I was always matched against MUCH better players in casual (100 ranks higher), with no alternative, being forced to grind to level 20 to get ranked matchmaking. Spawnpeeking was annoying at first, but it got easier to counter. People also leave mid-game a lot. Even when I did good in a round, usually my team mates can't follow through and we'll end up losing anyways. Not going to buy it anytime soon, not even on this 70% off sale.
(Bought Standard Edition)

Oh boy this game, to find an FPS that i have mixed feelings about is an understatement. This game has a mountain of problems that I can't believe most players either ignore or think that there fine, cause they are definitely not fine.

PROS
+ Its a really good gameplay style and concept that makes it stand out from other FPS games(COD, Battlefield, CSGO, Overwatch)
THATS IT, THERE ISN'T ANYTHING ELSE GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME.

CONS
- There is only ONE game mode, I don't care what they tell you, "but there's actually three(Causal, Ranked,Terrorist Hunt)". NO there isn't cause its just the same exact mode with the ONLY difference being either a longer game or waves of CPUs to kill with the same objectives as the other two modes.
- Operators all feel the exact same and with having only a single unique gadget means that you wont find to that one character to play, along with the fact that Ubisoft treats this game like its a fighting game. ITS NOT, at this point half of the game's Operators are blocked by a paywall of DLC passes and separate payments that makes it feel as if your not getting the full game but a demo, and just like a fighting game the amount of time it takes to get a single operator is just not worth the time at all.
- Reward and Progression system are complete and utter garbage. There are no rewards for leveling up so why even have a leveling system and the loot box system is just like i have NO WORDS for it, as you win matches instead of leveling up to get a free loot box or getting in-game currency at a good rate, NOOO you get your fucking CHANCE of getting a loot box increased which caps out at 50%. What makes this even worse is unlike EVERY OTHER FUCKING ONLINE GAME ON THE PLANET you only get one item out of these loot boxes with CAN be a duplicate, which means you just wasted all of that time for nothing.
-The game's currency is so badly unbalanced in its rate that if you do manage to save up you might as well get a new operator cause all of the weapon skins, operator skins and little things are blocked by a an stupidly high payroll that they almost cost the same as the operators themselves. The game's weekly challenges are just a laughing pile of garbage cause they give pretty much nothing in terms of currency.
-Then there's the toxic as fuck community, listen I play hours and hours of Overwatch (and used to play CSGO) so I know what a toxic community looks like but Jesus Christ this community is a shit show if I've ever seen one. You can get kicked for whatever reason under the sun( slow internet, taking someone's operator, you got killed easily and early in the game) and trying to play a game on ranked(or causal) is an achievement cause ANYTHING CAN GO FUCKING WRONG because why not,( you get team-killed in seconds or have either grown ass men and little kids screaming there fucking lungs out cause you just want to know how to use a certain operator's gadget effectively. Also Ubisoft's banning system doesn't help AT ALL AND ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE.

Verdict:
Just stay away from this game all together, do yourself a flavor and use that extra cash for something else on your wishlist cause you are gonna regret buying this piece of fucking shit game.

PS: If your wondering why I still play this game after saying all of this, its because one of my friends loves this game to death so I have to play this with them, I would never play this shit show of a game solo. NEVER
Absolutely zero progress on fixing this game. 
I keep coming back to it every few months just to find out it's still bad.
-I was on the container, around the container and it wasn't detecting it. Only after 15 seconds or so of me dancing around and on top of it I managed to detect it.
- 15ms Ping I shoot 3 times, I die in an instant. Killcam shows I haven't shot once. 
Hit reg/lag compensation system 0/10, absolutely garbage. 
Competitive 2025  
It uninstalls pretty quick though !
A great concept with wonderful ideas ruined by being made by a big studio that only cares about the money. You've probably been through this story many times already, so that's all I'm going to say. The gameplay generally improves over time, but ubisoft keeps adding dumber and dumber characters to the game to counteract that.

Find something else made by a smaller company that doesn't outright ignore issues with their product.
People who love the game will say all the good things. But mind you, there are many who quitted this game and regretted their decisions buying it. Why? Because it's an expensive FPS game, and despite all of its seemingly cool and unique features, is still plagued with ching chong cheaters with the gay teleporting hack, aimbot and obvious wallhacking. Even as you climb the ladder, there are still so many passive cheaters since the games nature is unpredictable, and passive hacking can be related to skills. Most people in this game ( even some pros) have suck aim honestly, so if you see someone scoring 3 instant headshots in a row, that's definitely a hacker, and that happens a lot. Watch out for free weekends btw, full of chinese cheaters and kids
The game is good. But this is one of the most toxic games I've ever played in my life. Not even COD, CS and DotA were this bad by comparison. It's a nightmare to play, in addition to an extremely sharp and off-putting learning curve that the game's tutorials and matchmaking do zero to remedy.

People say that past all the punishing, the game is rewarding. But I disagree. Despite the countless hours I've played with my friends, I think the payoff is roughly sub-par. Maybe it's just apparent that I'm a moderately skilled, slightly casual gamer with a full-time job. Definitely not a game for everyone. Or most people. It's challenging and unforgiving at times, but not the kind of challenge that I find satisfying to overcome. I'd give it a 7, but the community alone drops it to a 3 for me.
so annoyed rifght now with this game. been in my steam FOREVER. all of a sudden i want to free up space by deleting the test server....when i hit uninstall the game tries to open constantly. finally get it to force stop.

then my discord shows me as playing this game.

then i open my steam back up and the game starts to update. even after disabling "keep this game up to date" in properties.

then i start it all over again....... only choice to completely uninstall this game. review is for attention. maybe a known problem. please fix and ill delete.
I really like this game, but everything gets ruined when you're the last person on you're team and you die. Resulting in an angry kid getting salty than his gang of 9 year olds kick you :/
Ubisoft does not respect the customers. Permanant Toxic ban for chatting team kill is very un-Fair!
Atleast ban the player from chat box!
I had over 2000 Hours playtime in my main account and got permanant banned for Toxic! 

Bad Game, The people who created the game changed their game packages a week before the steam sale, so now you can't get any operators if you buy the base/deluxe version of the game.... What a rip off. It just shows how much they care about their communities.
Atrocious game. When you die you have no time to react to 1 full mag, it's as if it's 0.001 second but when you check the killcam it's longer; the game makes no sense lol. Also, very awful since it doesn't put you into ranked lobbies with your type of skills which could depend on KD or wins but instead it puts you to lobbies with people who have like 100+ hours. Worst thing is for me is that I can't refund this game because I have more than 2 hours due to idling. Wish I could refund this garbage.
nerf montage's sheild (when montage take his sheild down remove that fucking invincible time some montage use his sheild to close u and hit u with his sheild is nasty remove it plz!!!!)
full of bs angles. you just die from... thats right. you have no idea where, even if you do know the map. Also, cant manually chose maps... great game :)
Where do I even begin with this fucking game...

If you want the TL:DR of this review, I don't like this game what so ever and wouldn't recommend the game. Now that I have half the internet up my ass for daring to critic and view this game through a critical lenses2, let us begin.

The concept of Rainbow Six siege is an amazing idea to bring the reflex-like shooting elements of Call of Duty with the realistic tone of the likes of Rainbow Six Vegas could have made an amazing game. I say could have because this game turned into a steaming pile of shit from the broken banning system people abuse day-in and Day-out to the fact that the loot box system is a joke compared to ANY fucking game. Many people will come racing to say this game is fun and unique what with the THREE different game types you can play in Multiplayer. Slow down Ubisoft, you might blow some kids minds with this level of content.

Speaking of content, lets talk about the fact that Ubisoft literally removes content to create paywalls that you are practically forced to pay if you want certain cosmetics. "But Ayata! You don't have to buy those items. There is no need!" I can understand this defense but when a company removes content that was free to get from loot boxes to then shove them behind paywalls is just fucking scummy beyond believe. The fact the company then has the audacity to then get rid of certain skins all together just shows that the company doesn't care for the average consumer, they only care for the the little lackeys that spend hundreds of dollars on this mess of a game.If you pay this company money, knowing full well that the company is known to lock off content only shows you yourself don't care and choose to blindly support these shitty actions.

Now that the whole micro bullshit is out of the way, let's get to the best part of the game... The GamePlay

The game-play is fine for the most part but I won't say that I enjoyed it fully do to the sheer volume of toxic players who choose to abuse mechanics in a game all because they want the win no matter what. This game is filled to the brim with opportunity but it's lost as the years go own. I've been with this game since the launch on console all the way to now and I have to say the game became shit. Going from being stealthy and being rewarded for doing so, you now get punished for being sneaky and even get banned if you play too passive all because your team-mates are a little too trigger happy. Not only that, but your own team mates can report you out of the group if they so choose! awesome right?!

If you are unlucky enough to play alone, you have a massive chance of getting kicked if:
1. Your internet is slow
2. You take someone's operator
3. You piss someone off because you "stole their kills"
4. You did nothing and got popped off because fuck you
There are tons of more reasons to ban and the fact it can be done so easily only reinforces the idea that Ubisoft doesn't give two flying fucks about this game or it's player base.

Now if you ignore all this utter garbage and push through to play this game, you will be greeted with the most lack luster and depressing loot box system I have ever seen. This game implements the idea of rewarding players with the chance of getting a loot box based off of a percentage that you can increase by winning more if you don't get the loot box first go. Why is this an inherently bad thing? Simple, the chance of getting a loot box does not correlate with the possible chance of reward, or in layman's terms... the rewards are ass

What game thinks it is okay to make loot boxes rare as all hell to get unless you binge all fucking night, only to allow ONLY ONE ITEM to come form the damn thing you spent maybe an hour or two on? This practically bends the arm of ANY person who wants to get a skin or even get a stupid charm for a gun. However, there is a way around this fucking stupid idea of a loot box system, and that is Weekly and daily challenges.

To sum those challenges up in about two words: They suck.
The rewards from these awesome weekly's are not worth the time and effort you have to put since the amount of renown you gain is literally chump change n the massive pool of crap you need to get one loot box, let alone any other amount. So why even add these randomly generated, poorly thought out challenges to begin with? To create the illusion that you don't have to pay money to get the things you want in this game. But that's all it is... an illusion. The whole idea of having the opportunity to get a loot box is bullshit, I mean Overwatch and Killing Floor 2 did this shit right but nobody likes to mention good games that do shit right when reviewing this game. All in all, this game... is a mess. From the broken game mechanics people abuse and then defend for some fucking reason to the horrid business practices that Ubosift likes to practice with this game. If you got extra cash in the account, avoid this game till it gets it shit together. Buy a better investment then this fucking sinking money pit
Counter-Strike's less bright cousin that got held back for 3 grades and still has a parentally-enforced bed time at 7 o-clock despite being 21.

I can only assume this is popular because people really like sitting in corners staring through holes they've made in walls for some reason. It's cool if that's your thing but if a game's main gameplay loop makes me want to fall asleep at my desk that's probably not a good thing. Also I've heard you can get banned for saying bigger.
What's up with the load time? I went to the kitchen got some ice cream, still loading, I went to go take a crap, still loading. I took a shower & went to work & back, still loading. Why?  what's the deal?
Did i like the game? Hell yeah R6S is the best FPS from years, will i suggest the game to a friend? No, and do you wanna know why? There is no way to avoid toxicity in this game. You play alone, and you get Tk without reason. You find a group, start playing with the group, and now is your group that tk the others. And Ubisoft simply doesn`t care. Trust me: avoid this game, save your money for other thing. This game, at the moment and with this community, can barely be played for free.
This is how you will spend your time in this game:
33% : Queuing for casual match which takes an average of 2 minutes to get into a match.
33%: after finally queueing you will almost definitly get into ongoing matches which cant opt out of, and have a 5x higher chance of losing.
33%: waiting for the people who downloaded the game onto a floppy disk to load the map.
1%: playing an actual decent match where you have a 50% chance of winning or losing.

If Ash's acog is gonna to be removed from R4c,then who will be the next? Maybe we can see Jackal with out c7e, more operators like Lion(op in team but useless in single). What you are doing now is not reasonable! You have removed Jager's and Bandit's acog for a proper reason, it works. But today,Ash is no longer the top attacker, why to debuff her R4c? just buff G36c, it needs more damage! Ash is not a new opreator ,we all like what she is now,we don't need your change for her!And we don't want to see more your idiot changes in R6s!
I bought the starter edition a few weeks ago for about £11, then about two weeks later, they change all the versions of the game, getting rid of the starter edition and making the advanced edition which is a huge leap from the edition i have about £10. I feel scammed.
This game has best community ever.

Pros
1. Toxic , racism , sexism , harrassment , homophobia etc you name it.
2. Casual > 75% of the time you either get teamkill or vote kick for NO ABSOLUTE FVCKING REASON at all
3. Ranked> look at 1.
4. Ubisoft: We censored *nibba* in chat , that will solve everything. -smiling person with crossed arms.jpg-

Cons
Rainbow Six Siege
Similar to CSGO, this game is full of cancer. I was playing ranked when i met one of the countless throwers in game, two ranked matches in a row. After ruiing my first match by telling the enemy my position, and team damaging, attempting teamkilling, i killed him in the second game. after that, he continued to try to kill me. so, i shot at him, and killed him, thus resulting in ME getting banned. this shouldnt happen. teamkillings should have a safety measure, so people that just defend themselves from throwers dont need to get banned, while they walk free (even after getting reported by 18 people in 2 games
don't buy any uplay games on steam the authentication will fail and ubisoft will steal all of the money YOU payed them for a game i know this because i learnt it the hard way uplay and ubisoft have STOLEN over 300 pounds worth of games and downloadable content from ME if this doesn't patched then it will show ubisofts shady and scam-like business practices many have told me to go to customer support (pardon my language) to be frank fucking useless cunts who appear to also follow ubisofts scamming practices
Its company Ubishit like cheaters , team killers , no skills , boosted kids & all other shits but ban high skill players to want have team whit some kills ( 4 teamate just 1 kill at 5 rounds ranked matchs ) 
note : ranked matchmaking is beta yet after 4 years that RB6 realased


UPLAY WORST PLATFORM EVER. CRASHES EVERY TIME, UNABLE TO EVEN COMPLETE A MATCH, WITHOUT LOSSING CONNECTION WITH UPLAY SERVERS. 1/10 IGN.  ROTTEN TOMATOES 1%, METACRITICS 1.  DON'T BUY THIS. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR BETTER STUFF BOYS AND GIRLS.
Dumb concept, dumb design. 

The game is very boring and repetitive. The only thing you have to do is literally use a drone for a couple of seconds, camp in a building and then defend yourself or attack the other players depending on what side you're on. That's literally it.

I can also tell that they can't even be bothered to upgrade their servers because it takes forever to get into matches, and no, it's not my internet connection...



Overall, this game is very overrated, it's obviously catered to fake gamers on lower levels of thinking so I'm not surprised about how it's so popular...


[b]Avoid![/b]
To describe in 2 words: frustrating campfest. 

-Operatives have helmets, but every single one of them dies from one headshot. So weapon damage almost completely useless. Just as "defence" and "speed" stats of operatives.
-Everyone camps, as even one bullet from crappiest weapon could be fatal.
-Peeking mechanic enables camping even more, so prepare to be killed from frame perfect 1 pixel angle when you can't even see enemy.
-You can't shoot on the run. From any weapon. For some reason operatives feel obligated to shake their weapon on the run instead of attempting to supress enemy fire.
-Silencer makes shots COMPLETELY silent. Even impact with the floor is completely silent, what a powerful silencer.
-Very bad contrast. Noticing enemy often difficult by itself, but color choice adds difficulty. Even with maxed brightness you often can't see anything quickly enough.
-Community friendliness reminds me of DotA2. Probably nostalgia googles, but even DotA2 was better in this regard. Someone demands to play all rookies and kills/kicks everyone who chooses other heroes, someone flames because you don't know names of all operatives, someone just afks. Regular fights in public or team chat just about anything.

Not to say you can't have fun. Potent weapon variety, destructible walls, interesting operative abilities and game mechanics. But for now almost every match degrades to camping in one place, shooting anyone who appears in your sights.
good game and all, but when you headshot someone a few times (and watch the bullet go through on the final kill cam thing) and it doesnt get the final kill, it really makes you mad... dont buy as of now, the hit detection is trash and it needs an update for this!
So I decided I wanted to get the game on sale, and the fuckers at Ubisoft fucking decided to change the packages literally hours before the game went on sale. So when I got the game, i had no operators, and it takes like 50hrs to grind a single one.  The default one (recruit) doesn't even have anything special going for it. Ubisoft really outdone themselves.

Fuck Ubisoft.
Garbage.

(Hear me out)
It's as tactical and fun as super soakers are to firearms. The overall gameplay is gimmicky with operators and limited equipment. Single player terrorist hunt is a joke, you can't even select the game mode you'd like to play. The AI is pathetic. Graphics are not impressive even for a 2015 game on ULTRA, I'd expect better performance. Additionally the stability of the game also suffered from slight stuttering as I played single player. Of course it'd be much more fun eating a shit sandwich with friends but the community is rampant with toxic 12 year olds.

I tried the game when it came out and recently as of writing this review, the game has improved but you can only polish shit so much. I'm much more akin to the OG rainbow six's, CS:S, and SWAT series. Those games didn't require all of the gimmicky crap you see today and in my opinion they've stood the test of time because of their quality.

If you can get past the game's short comings and terrible community then you might actually have fun but I can't recommend dropping your valuable time and money on this game. Mainly because they've had so much time to fix all of the terrible bugs and mechanics but even still one of my biggest grips is the development. They fix one thing and then break another, servers are trash and not worth the insanity.
Garbage updates. You literally take no consideration into your patches, and instead of testing things on a fucking "Technical Test Server", you put it into the game and ruin it that way.
With Few hours in, game is nice, competitive play and all aspects of gameplay is great. Sadly If you have played HEROES & GENERALS, this is even ''better'' Grind for content.
i played this game and the community is terrible, you cant go a casual  game or ranked game without multiple people team killing. The game does provide good gameplay, I would not buy this game if you dont like, people acting toxic, constant team killing. And getting mad after getting shot through metal somehow!
As usual with fucking ubisoft. Game is great . but you pay for SHIT!

free weekend so im testing the game. its fun so il buy it. I have zero problems so far. The instant you
buy the game. BOOM doesent launch. Some bullshit with cant finding servers. just like every freaking ubisoft game in the last X years. I swear i hate that company and releasing broken games. 

JUst for that  DONT BUY THIS GAME. We as customers should not spend the first hour trying to hotfix their shitty work when we paid for it.
