A teenage developer who manages to realease great updates every week, new, detailed maps several times a year and no pay to win; this is my type of game.  500 hours and still enjoying myself, the Gold Upgrade lets you change the colour of your skin (Possible to abuse as camoflague, however, but no other advantages of any kind. It is more a donation than a DLC. That's why I bought it, this guy deserves it.

EDIT: This review is recieving a lot of critique, to clear up: Most free to play games rely on overpowered bonuses to get people to buy in game products. This game lets you camoflague better and have more storage space. As a comparison, for a free to play game, this really isn't bad.

EDIT 2: It's free to play, it seems you are all expecting free to play games to be pitch perfect AAA games developed by a team of 100 experienced developers. This is a one man operation. For the price you are paying and what you are getting, this is a good game.
Easily one of the best free to play games on Steam. This is a genre that has been over-done, but Unturned manages to be unique in it's own way. Kill zombies, gather resources, hunt animals, craft things and scavenge for items. That's all you do. 

You only have 3 types of enemies in Unturned, there's the normal, the military and the Mega zombies, the latter being quite rare and way more powerful which will make you want to run if you encounter one, especially if you're playing on Hard, but Unturned is more about the quantity of enemies... if you get swarmed, you're gonna have a bad time!

The beauty in Unturned stands in how simple it is, yet manages to be fun and quite graphically stunning. The developer team is just one single developer, and he's about 17 years old, that is something that should always be remembered, because not only does he update the game on a regular basis (about twice a week now), he has improved this game from an almost unplayable mess for older computers which was v2.0, to a polished and really smooth game v3.0 is. 

I still haven't bought the Gold Upgrade, but I'm planning on doing it, just because I want to "donate" to Nelson Saxton, this is how Free to Play should be. There's no "BUY HP FOR 5$", the game is COMPLETELY free, and all you get from the golden upgrade is cosmetic stuff, like new facial expressions, skin coloring and access to the Gold servers, which are restricted to "Premium" members (great for when you want to avoid F2P newbies). Again, there is more content but it's not shoved in your face 24/7, and it doesn't really make you a superior, more well-equipped player for owning it.

There's a set of skills where you use the experience you gather from killing zombies, hunting animals and harvesting resources, these skills are all very helpful to your survival, and will take their time to be fully upgraded. For now there's the Offense, Defense, and Support skills, maybe we'll see more in the future :)

There are numerous items in this game and for the looks of it, new items are still being added in each update. Weapons go from Hockey Sticks and Golf clubs, to Sniper Rifles, Machine Guns and more. You can find some vehicles too with a Fuel system, which means you can't go everywhere with your car without scavenging for fuel first. There's also tons of food around, but good luck on finding it in good condition, because Unturned also uses an item quality system. You can eat a carrot, but if it's moldy, your illness  percentage will increase and you'll end up scavenging for pills in order to cure it.

Do you remember how satisfying it felt in Resident Evil 4, when you had your inventory all organized and in place? Unturned now has the same type of inventory in v3.0, which is way more realistic than the inventory in v2.0. An item takes X number of squares depending on it's size. Oh, and you can choose 2 of these items for quick switching with the 1 and 2 keys, you'll probably put your weapon/tool here, since a zombie always appears out of the blue!

There's not much more to say about Unturned, it's a great game where you and your friends can spend lots of hours just creating a house and equipping it, or just scavenging and exploring Prince Edward Island to find all the secrets that lies within it. Unturned is a must play to anyone who has a Steam account, even if it is for just 1 hour, it will be enough to see the effort of a young developer which I undoubtedly respect. I'm not saying it's the best game ever, I even admit it can be a bit boring after some time (for me), but for the price of 0$, it's an awesome game, and I'm pretty sure I'll play it in the future to check out the updates.

(This review only applies for Unturned 2.0, 2014 Steam launch week)

One of few apocalypse survival games that truly grows from the community. The dev works on this everyday and is always looking for feedback and opinions on how the game is shaped, also constantly putting out strawpolls to the community and listens to us.

Unturned is played how you want, example, if you only want PVE you can select your server and if you want a PVP experience with your PVE you can select PVP enabled on your server, and yes, you can host your own servers on your computer.

It starts out like many other apocalypse survival games: you start out with your fists and 4 slots for your inventory. You have a lot of places you can wander to when you spawn, like a cabin camp, small town, military base, and many more. Your main mission when you start is to grab a melee, some food with drink, and a backpack. Once you've acquired these necessities, you may wish to find a gun if you want to PVP, or you may want to collect seeds to start a farm, or even start chopping down trees to make yourself a cozy place to spend the night.

The PVP system is great also, server hosts can select if players can bring in loot from their server (best for PVP) or not be able to bring loot in (Best for PVE Immersion). Their is a leaning system so you can peek corners also. You can also SHOOT OUT OF CARS (but not from the drivers seat of course)! Load some of your buddies in the trunk of your truck and do a hillbilly drive-by if you wish!

The towns are well structured for PVP also, their are lot of CQC battles to be fought, and also small hills for sniping, but snipers can be easily flanked if you don't post up right!

Base raiding is also important in PVP too. People on public servers will build structured bases equipped with sniper pits, plenty of windows, and escape routes! You must observe a player's base and attack it strategically, you never know how many players may be in there!

Now, time to farm my crops and build my base, I recommend you do so also!

The game itself is fantastic. The community on the other hand is garbage. Only servers without admins are playable. The admins for this game are almost universally children who are sore losers and will spawn themselves items and teleport to you if you kill them. This is a DayZ style game, dying is part of it. But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a "Blam" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose. And this abuse of power will usually be followed by degenerate badmouthing. 

TL;DR: Play the game, don't play on severs with admins.
I'll be honest, I personally don't care about the game. Its an all around solid zombie survival open world game. Not too much to say about it. However, what I do care about is the dev. He is a fantastic example of what a dev can be, and deserves all the support he can get. He is a wonderful cinnamon bun that should be cherrished in this land of abandonware and liars.
Since there's hardly any actual reviews regarding this game with factual information, I've decided to write one. This game is a free-to-play steam game, so obviously anyone can really play this. That being said, unturned is a zombie survival game which requires you to gather weapons, food, water, and other resources to stay alive. So far there are 3 (official) maps implimented into the game. It's possible to download more along with other weapons and items from the community workshop. You can play this game by yourself, with friends, or just join a multiplayer server. The game offers PVP and PVE game types. The game offers 3 difficulty types: easy, normal, and hard. If you do play this game and decide you like it, you can always purchase the "Permanent Gold Upgrade" for $4.99 which gives you a few gold items for your character. The money goes to Nelson Sexton, the creator of Unturned. Anyway with that review being said, let's list the pro's and con's!

Pro's:
-Free-to-play (unless you decide to support Nelson buy purchasing the gold upgrade)
-Fun to play for any age group
-Ability to play on a private server with friends (using hamachi)
-Crafting system
-Level up/skills system
-Free form building and the ability to create your own base
-Many different weapons and items
-Huge maps that offer a lot of stuff to do

Con's:
-The community on servers is cancer. They're basically a 10 year old version of DayZ or H1Z1 players.
-The hit range can sometimes be a bother. Seems like zombies can hit you a lot farther away than you can hit them.
-The night cycle seems rather long.

Anyway that's my review, I hope it helped.
Best survival I've played in a while

The game is full of places to explore, hunt, and scavenge for items to survive. With a variety of weapons and attachments at your disposal, you can hunt down animals, zombies, and other players.

(Weapon Segment) 

[spoiler]The fact that every attachment is compatable with every weapon, as long as it has the slot for it (Barrel, Tactical, Sight, ect.), Makes choosing your weapon fun. You have yourself an Outfield? Put a Silencer, Bipod, and a x12 Scope on it and you have an effective silenced sniper. Don't have a x12 Scope, Silencer, or Bipod? Take 2 duct tape and craft it with binoculars. Then take 2 empty cans and 2 cans of Cola and craft them with fire from a Campfire. Finally, find a Tactical Laser. All these will make a Zoomomatic (Scope that is better than the x6, but no reticle), a Muffler (Silent shooting, but muzzle flash still active), and the Tactical laser acts as a reticle for the Zoomomatic. It's the small things like this that I love in survival games. Being able to create a makeshift sniper using little Millitary grade equipment is just one example of the combinations of weapons and attachments.[/spoiler] 

(Survival Segment)

[spoiler]The surviving aspect is also amazing. Hunger, Thirst, and Illness are what keep you alive. Unlike most games, they go up as you get hungry, thirsty, and sick (At least in the games I've played, they go down). Make sure to Keep them down by eating food and drinking any drink. Illness can be gained from multiple sources, such as getting hit by zombies and eating raw/rotten foods and drinks. Illness can only be brought down with Vitamins, Anti-biotics, and a type of berry and it's crushed counterpart. You can go from town to town scavenging food and drinks, or you can take to the hills in search of wildlife to hunt. Grab a fire axe, handsaw, and pickaxe to start building a base in the hills, or fortify the roof of a building. Build traps for zombies and players alike. Light up an area with generators and worklights.[/spoiler]

(Experience Segment)

[spoiler] As you hunt animals, kill zombies, collect wood, and mine rocks, you will tend to notice a notification at the top of your screen informing you that you have gained som experience. At the start of Unturned, you are very vulnurable, But fear not. Pressing the button you have bound to open up inventory (Default is Tab) will reveal....your inventory. At the bottom you will see three tabs labeled Apperal, Crafting, and Skills. Selecting Skills will replace your character at the right with many options. The top shows your current experience and the red bars show the ammount of levels it can be upgraded by (Red being levels not yet achieved and Green being current level). For starters, you should focus on upgrading Survival (Slower thirst and hunger gained) and Immunity (Heal more effectivly and less Illness gained from zombie hits and raw/rotten foods). After that, you can decide if you want to upgrade Stamina to outrun the zombies or Warrior to fight back. Build more structures and traps with Crafting. Sneak around zombies and towards wildlife with Sneakybeaky. Take the shot with little recoil thanks to Marksman. Chop and mine faster with Outdoors. These Skills make surviving easier, just make sure to keep an eye on the Hunger and Thirst bar.[/spoiler]

In summary, this game as a fantastic weapon system, challenging survival, and rewarding skills. 10/10 for both the game and this being my longest review ever.
The term 'Free-to-Play' is slapped onto the side of a lot of games nowadays and it rarely lives up to expectations, with many of them carrying the undertone of 'Pay-to-Win'. With Unturned this isn't the case.

The game is a completely free to play zombie survival game, there is an option to pay to upgrade this to a Gold membership however this is purely for aesthetic purposes - Newer/slick UI, extra character model customisations, Gold username displays on the in-game chat, you can also gain access to gold-member-only servers with a few % bonuses like exp and loot but this is a level playing field as you can only play with other Gold members with these bonuses.

I don't wish to give much away about the gameplay but the game is awesome to play with friends and you can set up your own private servers fairly easily.

There are a few bits and pieces that I feel [b]could[/b] and most-likely [b]will[/b] be improved in the near future:
(There is currently a huge overhaul in development to the game so these points may/may not be valid once the update is live)

[list]
[*]The crafting system has pretty much zero guidance, and the recipes aren't exactly obvious. I don't like being spoon-fed but Stick + Bolts = Torch didn't occur naturally to me. [i]The wiki contains everything you need to know about crafting.[/i]
[*](Only in Player vs Environment) Once you have fortified, armed/equipped yourself, and have a steady income of growing crops the game becomes a lot less challenging - although I still manage to die in the simplest of situations... I would love to see roaming hordes on this game.
[*]At present the game only has one map, although the developer (The [b]one[/b] developer working on this title) is in the process of creating a new Canada map.
[*]Hackers are a bit of a nuisance in online PvP servers.
[/list]

[i]The above notes are just from my own personal take and experience of the game so far.[/i]

These aside, I love the simple, blocky graphics, the open world feel, the insatiable appetite of your character - same goes for the zombies, the weapons and attachments, the survival mechanics, the trust issues, the uneasy silences, the countless naked respawns etc etc.

I would really recommend this game to anyone who enjoys surviving with friends.
This is an example of an F2P game done right. You have access to EVERYTHING, except for extra customization for your character. And, to get the extra customization? Get the gold upgrade. And it's permanent, unlike other F2P games where you have to make $50 microtransactions every month for an account. It's very realistic, and with great mechanics and items and realism. Also, thought I'd mention this game is made by a 17-year-old guy. No-one else. One of the best games I've played. 10/10
-Downloads game in 2014.
-Plays single player for 30 minutes.
-Finds a Shit ton of bugs

-Plays game for 600 hours
-Buys 50$ worth of skins
-*Oh my god this is the same amount of fun but i can be the biggest bitch in the server and show off my skins so hard*

My points is this game can be enjoyed with out paying a single dime. 
You just pay to look cooler.
Gold membership allows you to be more creative and create a very unique character of your own design.

Pros :
Can be played on a potato PC.
You will find a lot of good friends.
If PVP isn't your thing you can play PVE and not get killed 100000 times.
Workshop items are  good and you will have fun when you get to the workshop item testing stage.
Can be played in so many different ways.
New stuff every Friday.

Cons: The community is childish.
Your ears may bleed from screaming toddlers call themselves pro cuz they spawn camp.
Too many obnoxious russians.
Your skin count makes difference to how pro you are.
Yet again a lot of kids play this, But the community is not as toxic as CSGO which is surprising because CSGO is a paid game.
The game is dead and is only played by kids or f2p's.
7/10.
As you play, you will have to worry about four main things; Irradiation, hunger, thirst, and health. Irradiation is the hardest to take care of once you progress. If you get into battles with hoardes of zombies, you can easily die due to radiation sickness.

Health is also pretty dificult to take care of, but not nearly as much. You can heal from eating, using medkits, and a few other actions. Hunger and thirst are the easiest to take care of. You can find canteens, and fill them with ocean water to avoid having to find bottled water or soda. You can also grow crops, and cultivate a farm at a location of your choice.  A few tips I can give are:

Set up a base away from zombies or towns, they can attack and destroy crops, and bases.

Be sure to NEVER provoke zombies once you first start with no weapon, unless you are an older player.

Also, make sure that the first thing you do is raid a farmhouse, you can find arrows, bows, guns, axes, bats, chainsaws, etc.

You will sometimes find what I like to call the "Hulk" 
It is a zombie that is larger than normal, and does alot of damage. If you try to fight him, be sure to kite him, or just shoot him.

If you don't know what kiting is, it is when you allow the enemy to attack, and when he is done attacking, stab him, then quickly run back before he hits you. Just do that continuously to kill him. 

The "Hulk" can drop a variety of military grade weapons. You may find that the most prominent of all is the "Dragonfang"

The Dragonfang is an LMG, with a magazine size of 100. Also, there is crafting in this game, which is much too complicated to get into on a post, but i can say that you can repair weapons, craft barricades, walls, doors, roofing, gun attachments, apparel, bandages, and many other things.

Also, be sure to check out the airport or military base when you get very good gear.

If you find any of what i said intrigueing, then by any means necessary, get this game.
I joined a server. A little kid, he came against me threatening me with a hatchet and told me to give him my stuff.
All I know is: Now i have a hatchet.
Okay as I've lately gained interest in this again since 2014 and I've played it a lot more, this is my review for "Unturned" (scroll to bottom for TL;DR)

Things have improved A LOT since it's first release that I will list.

- Map, the map is no longer "Canada" it is now still placed in Canada but now Prince Edward Islands which I have to say is a lot better than the Canada map. (imo)

- Gameplay, the biggest change in gameplay is the balance and additions to the skill system which are good. Still lacking as I think there's great potential for perks for skills.

- Gunplay, the gunplay in this game is a lot better since the recoil feels really good and the amount of modifications for the guns is a really good size.

- Multiplayer, wow has the multiplayer in this game gotten good, no longer do you have to search up tutorials on how to join servers and try to find servers that still even run. You just open up a server list and you can search for the most players, best ping, easy or normal games, or just join any server you see, your choice.

There are multiple difficulties including easy normal hard and premium, although most are normal with stupid plugins and rules such as starterkits and no KOS.

- Graphics, nelson changed the game to a newer version so that came along with better lighting, reflections and better particles.

- Vehicles, holy shit they are way better, funny how an 18 year old dev can create better driving than overkill software (creators of payday 2).

- Performance, it performs statistically a lot better since he updated the game to a newer version of the engine he uses. I doubt you'll run this game bad though.

|x| Thanks for reading my review, If you have anything to ask me or want me to add, shoot a comment on this review. |x|

TL;DR : Game has improved a lot over the course of a year and he's planning more like a new map set in america and a bunch of weapons.
In a few words, this is the DayZ for people who can't afford DayZ, or their battlestations can't handle it.
It looks weird, but it sure is fun.

+ Addictive
+ Completley free
+ Does not require too much

I do recommend this game, to anyone who can't play DayZ for reasons, mentioned earlier.
I loved this game, so fun. the fact that Nelson ties the community into the development well is awesome. during my 314.2 hours with this game, ive blown up more things than i can count. ive met some of my friends I now know from this game, and I never regret the moment i pressed play game, with the free to play mark next to that green button. if this game ever goes cash bought, i would buy it, and Im sure many of us players would too. keep up the great work Nelson, and do the do's that other f2p games have failed at.
Unturned is phenomenal game. The fact that this game has been developed by a 16 year old astonishes me. The aesthetics suit the game. Yes, the graphics are not great. However, I think, it should stay like this. It gives the game an identity. When I first played the game, I was not expecting much. I wasn't expecting a full on tactical rpg, or a racing game, or a base build survival co op, or a PVP open world deathmatch. I wasn't expecting any of these. Yet, it offered all of this. Survival is very rewarding. However, be warned, your stuff can vanish depending on the server. Dont get too attached to your items. Sandbox servers are the best as they allow you to do anything you want.

Unturned is a blast, you can really do anything. However, the community can be very toxic sometimes. Depending on how you look at it. In conclusion: The game does no other triple A game has done. H1Z1 and DayZ don't feel that friendly. Unturned feels friendly to new comers. Just bring a friend and scavenge the post apocalyptic environment.

Surprisingly there is lore in the world of Unturned. I'll leave you to discover the hidden lore.


>Spawn somewhere
>Gather some basic loot
>Finally GUN
>Give it to the kiddo on the beach
>Make yourself his leader
>Keep getting new kids to your gang
>Raid some bases with your small army of squeekers
>One of them wants to abandon your group
>Tell the rest to kill him
>That's how mafia works

10/10 would create my own cult again.

   [*] Possible cheating and/or people who abuse their power as the mod on a server 
   [*] Kits and the like that turns the game into a spamfest 
   [*] It's been a while for me, but I believe the Permanent Gold Upgrade also poses a mild issue. Where people with the upgrade can use their character slots as unraidable storage. Or when they die with one character, they can switch in their fully geared character to fight someone that beat them.
[/list]




[b]TL;DR:[/b] The game has some mild issues, but it's free and has an extremely active dev that constantly updates the game. Probably the best free2play game I've ever played, that didn't make me feel like it was trying to leech out all my money [b]and[/b] my soul.
Unturned is an indie free-to-play multiplayer open world survival video game designed and published by Nelson Sexton, the owner and founder of Smartly Dressed Games.

Unturned is a sandbox game in the emerging multiplayer apocalypse survival genre. Rather than focusing on being an MMO it provides players with easy systems to sit down and survive the zombie infestation with their friends. Over the course of a typical adventure, groups will face impossible odds as they work at fortifying locations, scavenging for supplies, trying to live off the land and negotiating with other people.
For a free game, it is amazing!
You've got so many features that many paid open world games are missing plus the Developer is constantly updating the game.

I host a server for this game now and develop plugins, I'm really happy with this game. Thanks Nelson.
It is simple and clear - It is really fun at the start until you have 600+ hours and it simply feels like a grind. But it is quite a good game still, because of the amount of time it actually had me interested in it for, much unlike h1z1 just survive or dayz that simply felt impossible to play after only 100 hours. Such shame this amount of time feels wasted, but I know it's not. Thanks to Nelson for making such a great game for players to enjoy free of charge.
600 hours of experience and very well known on the workshop, so I pretty much have seen it all.

Unturned is rather mixed. Most servers follow a pay to win format and are focused on PvP (get lucky to find a gun and kill everyone you meet) or die trying. These servers are trash. However if you join a server without plugins such as TPA and kits, it is completely different. It feels like a survival game more than a FPS. You get to build a base... only to get offline raided, fight off zombies while exploring towns, military bases, and other places. You get a chance to be the best rather than paying for a free gun kit and plane.

But why do I recommend this game? Simple. Besides the current state, it has been improving greatly since what it used to be a long time ago. The community has improved to an extent, the recent addition of bullet drop and scope sway makes sniping require more skill rather than a simple point, click the head and get an instant kill, and the workshops includes mods to suit almost anyone.

The workshop- it's brilliant. Nelson has done a good job with the additions he has made to Unturned, but the workshop has a lot of good content, including a lot of gun and hat skins (which has caused the economy to be similar to CS:GO or TF2) there are maps that can go up to 64 square kms and dwesigned for a lot of gamemodes. There's maps designed for survival similar to Washington/PEI and works well due to it's design, Maps that allow you to race, Maps such as mine (Isle of Wolves) which is based on progression, and of course arenas and maps to try and replicate famous maps such as Chernarus and Dust II. And some modders have added many workshop guns and vehicles too. Want to fire away at a horde of zombies with a minigun while your friend is flying you around on a Hummingbird? Now you can.

The graphics is rather a blocky and simple design. I don't dislike the design, but some people would be put off by it. Nelson has said he will improve it to have graphics that are similar to Firewatch. which I suppose is better, we'll have to find out ourselves. However this simple design makes it seem more like a cartoon than realism, which people could see it relate to games like Minecraft, just with guns.

If you are one who doesn't want to play the game due to factors such as the community, go ahead. But you're missing out.
as much as people slander this game
the dev has probably done more with this game solo than most dev(s) do with most other survival games

He listens to the community, adds new content and fixes things with atm weekly updates, and you get free drops. 

the community is far from tamed. Then again what do you expect for a free-2-play game.

Theres an option of buying gold, which granted you extra xp, but now its more cosmetic (it gives you cosmetics) as well as just buying it to support the creator.

overall its probably one of the best zombie/survival/zombie survival games i've ever played. Graphics aren't as important when the game actually works, and you keep adding content.
sideways 8/10
-Everyone is killing on sight
-I decide to be a friendly guy
-Runs into a newly spawned player
-I say "Hello"
-He throws a punch
-I ask him nicely not to pick a fight
-He keeps punching
-I bring out my shotgun
-"Well, you asked for it"
-The kid backs away begging me not to shoot
-This friendly guy gives no mercy
Unturned is a good game at its core, with no shortage of content. However, the public multiplayer is deeply flawed. You're best off getting a couple well-known friends to play, or going your own with singleplayer - unless you enjoy the sound of crying and screaming and having absolutely no chance of cooperation.

+ Balanced vanilla gameplay
+ Plenty to do and see, even in singleplayer
+ Easy to customize gameplay mechanics, allowing you to tailor your experience for a leisurely zombie massacre, a gruelingly difficult survival, or anything in between
+ More than one approach to success - everything in the game has its uses.
+ Flexible and intuitive building mechanics
+Very fair business model - the "Gold" privileges include access to more character customization and cosmetic items, and the ability to join "Gold" servers, which, as far as I can tell, are really just Easy+.

* Highly active modding community

- Many public multiplayer servers are bloated with excessive and unorganized mods and plugins, ruining the balance of the game and confusing players
- Overwhelmingly abysmal multiplayer community, with screeching children and genocidal maniacs in abundance

Overall, Unturned has solid gameplay, is highly customizable,  and will keep you occupied for a while whether you're out to mow down zombies or brave impossible odds. However, if you're hoping to make friends, you'll find yourself knee-deep in high-octane unadulterated cancer. Other than that, as far as free survival games go, it's not at all a bad choice.
This game isn´t a regular "Early Access Game" because Nelson Sexton updates this awesome game more than 10 times in a week, and does his best to fix bugs etc. 
-Also you can go for co-op and it´s free, can this game get better?

The game itself is fantastic. The community on the other hand is garbage. Only servers without admins are playable. The admins for this game are almost universally children who are sore losers and will spawn themselves items and teleport to you if you kill them. This is a DayZ style game, dying is part of it. But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a "Blam" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose. And this abuse of power will usually be followed by degenerate badmouthing. 



Unturned is another post-apocalyptic survival type game...
What sets it apart from the handful of other survival games coming out lately (After the success of things like minecraft and DayZ) is the heart, the community, the developer, and the fact that it's free haha.
I wouldn't say this game is amazing or inventive, but it is really really fun! The graphics are pretty basic, smooth flat coloured surfaces and blocky character models... but I like them a lot. I think the graphics, more than simple, are just plain charming. I love the silly character customization too. And who doesn't want to be able to survive in the apocalypse with their friends? Multiplayer for games like these is necessary, and I'm glad Unturned supports multiplayer gameplay.

I've heard a lot of people complaining that the beginning is too hard, but honestly as soon as I found a melee weapon I felt pretty set. If anything, I think the gameplay is too easy as it is right now. (This is before the big 3.0 update that is currently in developement) Once I established a base to store things in my character just stopped dying haha. Crafting is confusing and unintuitive though and I felt like it really took too many resources. (But maybe that's just me) the update is fixing that though with a built in crafting menu that gives you recipes based on the resources you have in your inventory. (As far as I can tell)
Once the newest version is released it will have a custom map maker as well! It's fairly easy to use once you've tinkered with it a little bit. I've already seen some amazing content from the community!

Anyway, If you're looking for something different from minecraft and dayz, look elsewhere.
But if you want a fun and simple survival game with lots of respawning zombies to headshot and constant content and gameplay updates, try it out. Why not? It's free! It also has some great PvP potential! (Hiding in fields, wearing camoflauge to sneak up on people, using things like trees, bushes, buildings to stealth with, etc)
Also, the game is being overhauled and so far the beta of the newest version really is adding a lot of improvements! I can't wait to see where this game goes!

Before I finish I'm going to say that the developer (Nelson Sexton) really puts a lot of hard work into this game. He listens to the community well and updates more than the other early access games I'm keeping my eyes on. I really apreciate how much time and effort he manages to put into Unturned.

I recommend buying gold if you like this game! The bonuses are worth the $5. (In my humble opinion)
This game is just way better than it has any right to be. I remember checking it out years ago (mostly based on the fact it was free). As someone who has played a ton of "survival" games I wasn't expecting much and I was blown away by how much it exceeded expectations.

This game is FAR better than basically every other "survival" game AND it's free. How did this happen?
Unturned is a very easy game to judge at first glance. It doesn't appear to have amazing graphics, it has a Roblox-looking vibe, and there are noobs everywhere. Well, some of this IS true, but this is one of those games that you have to submerge yourself in a little before the true beauty shows. It can be seen as a game where you wander around chugging glue and getting high in order to stay alive a little longer...or it can be seen as a challenging survival experience where strategy is key. With full release said to be coming soon, let's see what early access is like in Unturned.

Unturned is a zombie apocalypse game where you must wander around as a human survivor to collect food, water, keep warm, and avoid zombies to stay alive as long as possible. You can find a plane if you want and go on a joy ride, then maybe you can start building a giant base, storing your prized finds from your adventures. After a few weeks of playing singleplayer, you've done everything. So why not check out multiplayer? There's plenty more to see and experience in this game.

Let's talk about the look, since that's one of the main things we focus on.  The graphics have no crazy detail whatsoever, but that's not the point. The graphics are focused: You see what you need to see. You'll soon find that the models actually look quite pleasing in their basic and rounded look.

Alright what about the survival experience? It can be very challenging in its own unique way.  You need to keep finding fresh food and water to stay alive, and you'll have to strategize and plan where you will go to satisfy your stomach. There is a temperature mechanic, where you will have to take cover in shelter during the cold and dress up to stay warm. It can be difficult to create a sustainable food source outside of towns. In short, the survival aspects in this game always keep you moving around the map like a nomad. You can settle down in one place...but not long before you have to make another run to Big J's Diner for some grub.

Let's talk PvP...a big aspect to this game. If you thought shooting zombies with a high caliber DragonFang is fun, try shooting at some other players in multiplayer. The gun mechanics are satisfying: You have your standard recoil, your aiming, but where this system really shines is the customization. This ranges from increasing accuracy with a barrel attachment, or alleviating recoil with a nice grip. The melee is pretty great too. With left-click, you get the standard attack for that given weapon. With right-click, and the sacrifice of a little enegery and a longer attack time, you can strike a heavy, hammering attack on both zombies, and players. The aspects put together are very easy to understand, and creates several opportunities for players to have their own technique.

Here are my PROS and CONS.

PROS:

-Great in it's simplicity | It's a very simple looking game, and that makes it special.
-Amazing PvP mechanics | The PvP in this game is very nice and customizable. Well balanced.
-No pay-to-win! | You can buy a Gold upgrade, and gun skins, but never any advantage-granting things.
-Player and UI (User Interface) customizability | Tune your looks to fit your style.
-Ties in with Steam groups | Make a Steam group for your Unturned team, it ties into multiplayer.
-Absolutely free (as of now) | Unturned is 100% free to play (this may change at full release...)!
-Easy to use map maker | The game features a great way for players to make their own maps.
-Steam Workshop capabilities | Design mods, skins, and more with the Steam Workshop.

I thought, since this review unexpectedly gained popularity, that I would take advantage of this situation to direct Nelson's attention to some things the community, and I, would like to see before full release. These have been gathered from both me, and comments I've seen from the comminity (Feel free to suggest more things in a reply to this review, I will add them if they seem fit for the game.)

-The return of the original Canada map, restored and re-balanced of course. :)
-Add an electrical system to the game. This could include ways to generate electricity, store it (to a certain extent), power other electric-requiring things (this could include car batteries).


Thank you so much for your efforts and time, Nelson!
Better than majority of other Early Acesses zombie survival games, for the low price of being completely free with no P2W mechanics, made by a single guy. Cannot reconmend it more.
Unturned is a survival game where DayZ's gameplay meets Minecraft's look.  It's developed by a 19 year old Canadian who is connected to the community and committed to updating/patching regularly.  The game, while still in development, has a lot going for it.  There's a lot of items, a good crafting system, skills to boost, and a survival system.

My complaints so far are the zombies are too slow and easy to kill and the map itself is rather small.  I would also like to see some custom server options to address these issues.  Also this game doesn't seem like it would be much fun single player.  The human element really adds to survival games like this.

I do like what I see and so I bought the DLC to throw some money to the dev for his fun, free game.  I consider it an investment for further growth.

So do I recommend it?  Yes.  Grabs some friends and try it out.  It's free so you have nothing to lose.  Then keep your eye on the development and we will see where this goes.  Who knows maybe I'll see you out there.  You'll know it's me when you see a guy wearing nothing but a chef's hat, and is tripping out of his mind, and clenching a sledgehammer menacingly.  You know what?  You might want to go the other direction.  He's weird.
[b]TL;DR[/b]

This game is a great sandbox survival game where you can construct houses, kill zombies, scavenge for supplies, store the stuff you find and in multiplayer modes, fight against or with other players for supplies and survival. The graphics are not the fanciest that can be found out there, but it's because of the pure and unique style this game has. A moderately complicated crafting system is also present. If you like survival MMOs, this game is for you. There's also a singleplayer mode for a more peaceful experience.

[b]1. The Actual Review[/b]

When I downloaded this game, I wasn't really expecting much, especially because my brother recommended it and most of games he likes, I don't. But it was a huge blast when I noticed how complex and how challenging this game actually is, especially in multiplayer modes. You can carry both a primary and secondary weapon (in the beta version 3.0, which is way better than 2.5), which are basically a rifle/shotgun/assault rifle as a primary and a melee/pistol as a secondary weapon. You can also find clothes, helmets, backpacks, food, water, and did I say HELMETS?! and many more items that will help you to survive longer by providing more space to carry more items, healing and protection. 

[b] 2. Pros and Cons [/b]

[b] Pros[/b]
- Huge sandbox experience;
- Decent amount of items;
- Difficult to survive when you are not experienced;
- In multiplayer, you will actually do anything not do die because the death penalty is high (this can be a con for some, but I really love games where you are actually afraid of dying);
- The dev takes good care of the game and updates frequently with new content and fixes (about 3 times a week);
- Good crafting system;
- You can create your own maps;


[b]Cons[/b]
- The community is generally friendly but can be annoying depending on the server you join;
- Singleplayer gets very easy and boring after some time;
- The beta branch of the game sometimes experience a few game-breaking glitches that are, most of times, solved quickly.


[b]3. Personal Experiences [/b]

>Second day playing multiplayer, naked, because I died in the previous day;
>Some guys who like to play as cops at stratford point guns at me complaining I'm commiting a crime by walking naked;
>I get a death penalty
>A mysterious sniper takes down the tree guys from a distance and I leave the place alive
>Mysterious sniper turns out to be a guy with a farmer's hat and military gear
>He gives me some food, water and orders me to carry a few things for him
>Minutes later, after helping him out a bit, I find a swiss knife and hide it from the mysterious sniper
>Fearing he will kill me after I have a considerable amount of stuff, but no weapons and that he's using me as a packmule, I backstab him in the head
>get all his gear and he comes at me, naked and carrying a rifle a few minutes later
>Rek him again

10/10 would rek the mysterious sniper again


>After one week and recently dying, I have a supressed sniper and a few things;
>I see a group of 3 full-geared guys with nightvisions and rare military weapons;
>I take one out with a headshot and the others try to hind behind a tree, but they're still in my line of sight;
>I take the other two guys out and start being called aimbot by the whole group
>They start to say in the world chat where they died
>as I'm taking their gear, a guy that barely has clothes hits me with a sledgehammer in the head twice and I die
>I respawn and go desperately try to retrieve my stuff
>Give up when I notice there's about 15 players fighting for the loot with snipers, grenades and assault rifles

10/10 would start a war again


There were many other epic moments that I wish I could tell, but my review will get too long! Do get the game if you like this genre and don't get very mad when you die!
[b] I've been playing this game since 2.0, so I finaly decided to make a real review [/b]

Unturned is a Sandbox Indie Zombie Survival game with Minecraft style Low-Polygon graphics developed by Smartly Dressed Games. The community provides a huge ammount of modifications, such as maps, weapon skins and vehicles.

So lets get into the point!

The game has been arround for a long time (since 2014), so it has improved significantly since the first version. 

[b] Info [/b]
The current version includes huge ammounts of content such as cars, planes, berries, different weapons (everything from snipers to makeshit weapons to railguns) and armor.
Base building is one of the key aspects of the game. Its fully customizable and allows you to build nearly anything. With the bases comes also base raiding and equiptments from side to side introduced in various updates that are still on going.
C4, Rocket Launcher, Tank shell, You name it!

There are also several different enemy types. The most common is of course the normal zombie. they don't really have any special abilities, but there are few variations like crawlers and runners. The second most common are the acid throwers and flame zombies which actually explode and spread fire. The game also has giants who actually throw rocks at you!

[b] Mods 
[/b]
The game has a really high moding potential. Several new community made weapon skins are added every month for almost every weapon! As said before the community has advanced on even higher level and provides a lot of high quality maps and vehicle modifications. I would recommend maps such as OverGrown and Quarantine.

[b] Online [/b]
Unturned offers many different game modes from Paintball to Survival games (Arena). Most of the people usually prefer the classical survival which is often mixed with some roleplay aspects on many servers. Starting a server is very simple and shouldn't require much knowledge, so anyone with almost any pc is able do it. 
I haven't really experienced much problems with servers (IE: Connection, Hosting).

[b] Performance [/b]

Powered by Unity Engine, should run on almost any pc +30 fps. 
The performance isn't really high, only 70 fps on GTX 860m medium settings.
And about graphics. You can't really expect much from a game which has simpler graphics than minecraft so I don't really have anything to tell about them.

[b] Overall [/b]

Great survival game with a moding potential of garry's mod.
Friendly towards new players, Offers some great FPS/Sandbox/Survival gameplay.
9/10

My son is a total minecraft nut. When he saw Unturned he jumped on it, and I reluctantly followed him. To my surprise this turned out to be a great deal of fun. My son has racked up nearly 200 hours on his account and is constantly adding mods from the steam workshop. I'm extremely impressed with how much work has gone into this game, and how the updates roll in on a weekly basis. Because of all this I didn't have an issue getting him gold edition and shelling out for keys on a regular basis either.

This is one Early Access title that lives up to what someone can do when they put a good deal of work into it. I say that after putting money into kickstarter games, and other early access games that have been abandoned or were mere empty shells of promises. Unturned is an amazing game with a great deal of things to do. By allowing people to create mods in the workshop, it's given the game even more life to it. Very well done.
Best Survival Game I've played so far. The Graphics are meh, but the gameplay is great. Amazing work of such an young developer. Everything is nicely balanced and exactly how it should be.
Unturned is a PvE/PvP zombie survival game.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Like any zombie survival game is the goal in Unturned to build a big base and show dominance.
You loot villages, military bases, camping sites, farms, and more to find loot that will help you get stronger. However, whenever you go to these locations you may run into other players with the same idea. Will you attack them, sneak away or try to make an ally?

[h1]Pro's[/h1]
[list][*]Free to Play
[*]Good replayability
[*]Building a base is easy
[*]Customizable weapons
[*]Fun to play with and against friends
[*]Dieing isn't very punishing as getting items doesn't take hours
[*]Frequent updates
[*][url=http://steamcommunity.com/app/304930/workshop/]Workshop[/url]
[/list]
[h1]Cons[/h1]
[list][*]Getting certain items you need in order to progress can be grind
[*]You can get sniped by a camper and can do little against it
[*]Destroying a base isn't hard at all
[*]Offline raiding is easy
[*]The community is mostly young kids
[/list]

I would recommend this game when a friend can host a server where you have some rules to not base raid.
It can be a bit grindy, but if your friends are active its no big deal.

It's [u]free[/u], so why not give it a go?

[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Multiplayer_Game_Reviews#curation]Click here to check out all my multiplayer game reviews.[/url]
When I first got this game I was not a fan. 
[list]
    [*]The crafting required a wiki to figure out
    [*]The inventory was weight limited
    [*]Almost no zombie variety
[/list]

Today this game has improved MASSIVELY
[list]
    [*]Added a crafting menu to browse blueprints (which are simplified and intuitive)
    [*]The inventory is space limited (bringing the joys of the inventory shuffle)
    [*]More variety in zombies, guns, and vehicles
[/list]

This game has gone from one of my least favorite to a staple in my library.
I can't say it enough, this game is awesome. 

I was alone on my personal server and I died twice, then I found a firemans axe and I got a coyote pack. 
I logged out in the military complex. The next morning I got super lucky and found a rucksack in one of the towers, I then killed the zombies that had spawned there and proceeded to loot. When I got to the tables near the shooting range I found a ghilli suit, next to it was a timberwolf (sniper rifle) and to be honest I was a little too over excited about this. I continued to loot for continues days. 

A good friend of mine got this game about a week and a half after and I gave him the server info. Hours passed and he got geared up too. We drove around in the vehicles that we'd collect like nothing could kill us, I eventually built a base for us right next to the military complex (mind that we'd never explored the right half of the map). On day my friend and I had decided to go on a "vacation" and go to the airport on the exact other side of the map. Once we arrived at the airport we looted and found a katana, my friend decided that I should keep it, so I did. We had finished looting and started to drive back to our base and my friend went to go make himself dinner, took the wheel and started to drive home. 

As we passed through a town I noticed that the gas tank was nearly empty, so I parked the car behind a gas station and killed the zombies that where near the car as I got out of the car, I accidentally honked the horn. As I was filling up the gas can I started to see smoke coming from the back of the gas station. I rushed back to the car to see a horde of zombies that was attacking the car that had caught on fire. I pulled out my katana and killed about four zombies and my headset roared, my screen instantly turned bright grey. All the zombies where lying dead on the floor, along with my friend. 

As my friend got back he screamed at me and I was just cracking up. 
You should get this game, it’s amazing
5/5 exploding cars with afk people inside. 
20/20 zombies. 
1/1 screaming people



-Customizable Graphics
-Realistic Sniping
-Customizable Controls
-Lots of Weapons
-Zombies Don't Do Too Much Damage
-Scopes and Attachments Help in The Game
Overall I would rate this a 10/10 free game on steam.
Unturned is one of the best games you can get, buying the premium edition give you nothing that gives you a major or even slight advantage over someone else, also, like Minecraft, GTA 5, and Arma 3, you can mold the game to do whatever you want.

Want to do a prison escape RP? 
There are servers for it!

Want to kill everything in your wake?
There are servers for it!

Want to play battle royal? 
There are servers for it!

Il go over certain pros and cons to give you an idea of the game:

Audience: Everyone. You may find a lot of kids on the KOS servers but if you explore the RP servers they are almsot completley filled with much more mature players.

Graphics: At maxed out graphics this game jsut looks amzing, at least amazing when you relize this was made by one guy and was originally a Roblox server.

Difficulty: Depends, at its hardest it is nearly impossible, at its easiest it is basicly a walkling simulator.

Time you will be sucked into this game: A lot, personally I have 1000 hours and still love the game and have not even delved into the modding community, it outranks my second most palyed game by 750 hours 

Story: The story is hidden over the game and few really know about it, but it has some really cool lore that is still being updated on.

Anti-Cheat: The anti-cheat is amazing, I have never seen a hacker that has not been banned instantly.

Bugs: My only problem with the game are the bugs, almost every update breaks the game in someway, but is not surprising when its just our boi Nelson making the game.

Overall I would give it a 9/10
Hello, here are my thoughts and review for this game called "Unturned" currently in Early Access.

( Updated as of 9/5/2015)

[h1]Now here is why the game is great[/h1]

Steam workshop! hell ya mod support.

Gets updates everyday if not everyday then still every week for sure.

 Easy to pick up and just play. as well very small sized download.

The dev cares for the community listens to people's ideas and more importantly the dev cares for his "game" not the "money".

It's not paytowin not even a tiny bit, yes you can buy a premium dlc but it doesn't effect the freetoplay player base cause the premium advantage's are only applied to premium servers which no freetoplay can join of course premium players can play on normal servers but they will not have any of the advantages in those servers.

The game play is also very great it's really very fun searching for food,weapons and other stuff and the skill point system is also great, there is also a option to use "thirdperson" view.

The graphics aren't the best but they aren't the worst for sure, the graphics are just okay actually and pretty bearable.

Gun customization yes it has gun customization! You can attach silencers,scopes,grips etc, it also has character  customization! which is also a great feature.

Game is going in a good direction the dev know's what he is doing and what his plans are for future unlike the most other "Early access" crap the dev's don't pretty much even know what they want to do or are doing.

The area of the game is thankfully pretty big which give's it a open world feel.

Cars really? yes i said cars i did, driving is not the best but it's not worst it's quite fine actually. as well more to come in future such as boat's or maybe even plane's.

2 season's currently one snowy and other your usual normal. But the snow one has a variety of different thing's.

challenging  many time's you will still have a chance to die even if you already have alot of stuff thus requiring  quick thinking and strateges.

It has a crafting system which is pretty neat, but you might get a lot of confused at first when crafting thankfully there are guides to help you get through that.

Sound's for guns and cars and all sort of that stuff are pretty neat and feel pretty realistic.

[h1]Now let's go to the bad stuff[/h1]

It's unoptized it might lag in your computer but the dev is always trying to optimize more and more over time.

Hackers yup hackers not everyone in this game is a hacker for sure, but you might see a few hackers in your game trying to make you're experience bad but the game now has valve anti cheat VAC which i think has helped ban quite a lot of hackers.

Most of the community is very unfriendly you will see a lot of naked man with knifes trying to kill you for stuff, also i recommend taking a look at you're back you're friend might be trying to......

The net code is not so good actually, you will experience quite lag on most server's but the dev is always improving it, thankfully it does have a option to play solo.

The Ai has many problem's. they will sometime's go through wall's and such. 

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

What the hell are you really waiting? it's already way better then the other Early Access crap that's been put it to steam these days and even more importantly it's full free and it has a bright future, just click the play button and start having fun!

[h1]One of the best freetoplay game's out there, good crafting,challenging ,skillpoint system and with a bright future.[/h1]

This game is great and the fact that it's its 3rd year on steam makes me tear a little bit. I remember when I did not want to play the game because its graphics were pretty fcking bad,but I loved AND still love the gameplay. Personally I did not and still don't enjoy the PVP as much as making bases,but I still love it. Its crafting system is really nice and easy to understand. I really enjoy making different base ideas,for example a tree house or a metal base in the middle with wood outside. It has A LOT( AND I MEAN A LOT) of items,weapons and vehicles,which are ideal for roleplaying. I really look forward into spending even MORE hours in this game ( I spent 20.9 hours in 4-5 days,I currently have 465.7 hours) because Nelson ( the main developer) is constantly adding new things to the game and releasing new maps. I cannot wait for a graphic update ! :)
I started playing Unturned in its early stage, seeing it grow so large with such a supportive community really makes me smile. The game's graphics are not spectacular but its shaders really turn out nice, it is just a really well made game.
The only flaw I have is that there are still alot of children in the game shouting & cursing trough the voice communication, this sadly can not be improved since its the audience and not the game itself. I really recommend this game to play with friends whilst in a voice communication app and choose to be thiefs and raid bases or just survive the EVP.
Amazing for a free game, i would reccomend it to my friends but i don't have any. 
I would recommend buying the gold upgrade if you play it a lot and would like to help Nelson (the developer) out
I remember when this game was Deadzone back in Roblox years ago, and I have to say it has come a long ways and still retains the same amount of fun from all of those years ago. The gunplay is good, the crafting system is very flexible with an infinite amount of designs, the low polygons mean you don't drop to 17 fps when you walk into a forest. Many different server types and a workshop that keeps on giving. I think it fair to say this is as close as you can get to a perfect game.
I dont get the point of a negative review. Its free, updates alot and im pretty sure it was the first game i got on steam


[h1] Pros
-Really REALLY fun when you play with friends
-Its Free
-All the updates are good (even the bug fixes)
-Dont need a good computer to run

Negatives
-Could be easier to play on a private server
My mate and I worked as highwaymen, sticking up newbies as they passed along.
Some of them fought back, but quickly learned that was not a good idea.
We stick up two guys, but we end up teaming up and built our first base together.
We are now a team of 4, this time from highwaymen to bandits, then to trained killers and full geared soldiers. 
We ran the server man, two of us killed and looted while the other two built the base. We made trades for C4 and raided other bases. The loot is unimaginable. AKs, to Mini-Guns, explosives, Alice Packs, you name it.

People soon turned on us, a trade ended up in an ambush, our base was discovered. Two clans formed together to raid our base. We were outnumbered, and out-gunned. We soon ran out of ammunition, their beds were built nearby. 
Bullets stopped flying for a second, we layed on the ground trying to pick up any sound to pinpoint their location. We then heard a beeping noise. C4.
The walls blew up and the doors busted open, they came from the roof and they were inside. 
As a last minute strategy, my friend picked up a chainsaw, it was all we had left.
He turned around and said to me, "fuck these fuckers gotdamn them gotdamnit shit".

He ran out the door as I yelled back to him "LOL". Bullets rang out and he died instantly. Red colored the walls. I pull out my Glock and aimed and their head. click. No ammo. 

My screen is a red color and the camera is doing a 360 on my body, and see them looting all the crates and a tear runs down my face.  

Oh and I believe one guy made this game?? That's crazy, $5 man donate it he deserves it. A lot of work was put into this. Simple, fun.


Don't let the graphics mislead you. This is actually a well packed Zombie survival game. It's frequently updated by one of the most responsive dev i've seen in Early Access.
It's Free to play but no 'pay to win.' It has workshop, marketplace and even a map editor for you to build your own zombie apocalypse.

I know it's free. But go buy the gold upgrade, it's worth supporting Nelson so he keeps updating this nice game.
Don't listen to the negative reviews, "OH, ITS THE DEVELOPERS FAULT! BAD COMMUNITY! OH ITS SO BAD!". It isn't the developers fault, it's not all rainbows and sprinkles. Unturned is a amazing game that at first look you might say "minecraft parody, is bad game", but once you play it. You might never leave it. The game is about surviving in a zombie world, not fending of zombies(in multiplayer, zombies are the least of your worries). The game is really good, being made by a small team. Best of all? It's updated every friday.
Unturned, is got to be one of the most addicting F2P games out there, Because of how fun it can get playing within friends,
but there can be some bugs in the game at times. Its suposed to be a survival game, by building bases and defending them
from zombies, but now its turned into a PVP game, basically, it isnt famous anymore for the zombie survival, now there is just 12 year olds that are thirsty for pvp. People that have been playing Unturend since the start, prefer the good old Survival times. Hope This review was Helpful.
[h1][b]"Oh no! Another Minecraft Shitty Game about Zombies *crying*" No is not![/b][/h1]
[b][u]Unturned[/u][/b] is game about Zombies and Survivors where we need (As Survivor) Survive hard times, find food, water, something what you can defend yourself build your first house then upgrade it after hours of playing into Big Castle or something even better.

the best free to play survival game out there, hands down. Hell, I'd even pay money for it and I prefer this over games such as DayZ and Rust..
It's a lot like DayZ, gameplay wise, the maps are based in cities and towns, you can build bases, gather loot, everything you'd expect from a survival crafting game. On top of that there are cars, helicopters and boats. 

If you have been living under a rock for the past year, you should really try this game out, its free so... why not?
Name one other game that you can fly a rainbow hatchback over a prison while being shot down with railguns and .50 cals and a jet following you shooting at you with an HMG to escape via umbrella, land on the prison rooftop and kill everyone with a full auto shotgun, just to be killed by someone in a tower made of birch they built nearby with a sniper rifle while half-naked. To then respawn to be killed again by someone with a minigun, full ghillie suit and nightvision. To respawn again, to whitness someone being sniped to pick up their gear, run, then counter the sniper with their rocket launcher w/ 7x scope they happened to have, shoot their metal & maple sniper tower, killing the sniper, making the sniper to rage quit. 

[Server]: Xx_LeEt-hAx0r_sNoiPer_xX has been killed by Fiery with a Rocket Launcher!
[Server]: Xx_LeEt-hAx0r_sNoiPer_xX Has been Banned By Battleye!
[Server]: Xx_LeEt-hAx0r_sNoiPer_xX Has left the Game.

I first got this game because it was free and it had zombies, my two biggest selling points.
At my first play of it I was thinking "Look at the state of these graphics, these zombies look like something a child would draw"
Now after playing the game for more than the time it takes to get owned by your first blocky zombie, I have to admit that it is probably one of the best free to play zombie survival games available.

After leaving the devs to work on it a little more I was very happy to see the changes they had made to what was a good game making it a great game, a more understandable crafting system was added, the level system they had in place was improved upon, more maps have been added as well as more guns and vehicles, and after foraging for berries that made my character trip balls I had completely forgotten about the graphics looking like minecraft and was instead focusing on trying to stop my ass from clenching while being chased by a horde with nothing but my fists.

I'd say buy this game, only it's free, so you really have no excuse not to give it a go.
Unturned:
Yup, it's another zombie-survival game, but just because it's traits aren't different, doesn't mean it's a bad game. The graphics are strange, but they're better than many other free games and even some paid ones. Solo is fun, but it does get boring pretty fast sadly. In multiplayer you have 2 choices---> 1: Join a random PvP server or PvE server and meet-up with 99% jerks---> 2: Join a friend's server or create your own, where you can play with or against your friends.
I personally have done both. What I have found (some is based on opinion) are that random servers tend to be more laggy, especially on my computer. The random ones also tend to have NO SUPPLIES EVER!!! I'm NOT saying it wasn't fun. It was fun! The good parts about the random server are the extra challenge, which yes is VERY difficult to overcome these overpowered opponents, but possible. You can also play the hiding game, where you stealth around and try to kill your overpowered opponents with strategy such as: Using a horde of zombies on them, Making them bleed with a trap, or sneaking up on them and shooting them in the face 50 times with the worst gun in the game. OPTION 2: Playing with friends! I personally found this to be A LOT more fun! There are various mini-games you can play as well. PvE is also a good time! Although I did get bored fairly quickly, it was fun watching my team-mate derp around in a horde of zombies.
Suggestions:
- Create-Your-Own worlds, cars, etc.
- Make the bridge lead to a city area, with MANY more zombies, but better loot.
- Make the arena better in some way
- Make alternate game-modes.
- Add bikes, moter-cycles, and ATV's that go VERY FAST, but you fall off if you hit a zombie and it breaks down faster (A LOT of damage when hitting a zombie).
Overall:
This game made me want to cry when I first played it. I wish I could feel the same feeling of when I first played it! I hope the creator adds some new spicy stuff, including the create-your-own stuff that he is already doing (I think). The game is difficult at first, but you as a player can adapt. This game is VERY GOOD!!!
Personal Rating:           4.5 Stars (Free Game Personal Rating)
Pros-
+Great gameplay!
+Perfect survival aspects!
+Atleast 50+ hours of gameplay!
+Constantly being updated!
+Open world!
+Map creator!
+Create your own character!

-Cons
-(Currently) Not much fun to replay it.
-Your first military weapon is AWESOME to get but after that you start to find them more and they start to get easy to come across making it less exciting to get.
-To easy to find weapons.


Over all I think I give this an 8/10. I LOVE this game and I can't wait till 3.0 is released!

This game let me tell ya, at first when I got it I thought it was a roblox spin off and it was gonna be cheesey, Well was I very very wrong this has the feel of a great game and most likely will not find a free game like this in this game catagory
so, i've been playing this game for some time (atm i have 838h) and i whould like to point out some things in this game in three categories : Good, Bad and "Absolutely horrible".

Good category :
                             1. Good combat , its quite decent when you dont get killed right when you are behind a wall (thats the hitbox+ping so if you have like 150 ping or so and the other player has 50 you are gonna teleport and get shot in delay and other things you should know)

                          2. Also has some nice players (exept times when they are toxic) and a big russian comunity (we will talk about russian servers later)

                          3. Raiding. Its so satisfying when you get the gun you wanted and then you go destroy the bases on the server, trust me.

                          4.Its so fun playing with a friend or two or how many you want really , you get caught on to this multiplayer-online game so easily with a couple of friends.

Lets get to the "Bad" side of Unturned, and its getting spicy:

                          1. The lag is unreal , you need a pretty good pc and a good internet to get over that thing (speaking of framerate and ping) other than that its ok really

                          2. This is gonna have a big impact in your first hours : good players . Unturned has this thing that there are a lot of good players and its unreal when you get killed by a guy and then he laughs in the chat or something.

                          3. "Rubber-Banding" i know it sounds stupid but i dedicated this whole point to this. Rubberbanding works like this : You go on any surface and sometimes on rare ocasions you just fall under the map and go back up in a split of a second, and its rare on the surface but on vehicles..... everytime you get on a vehicle you rubberband.


                          Oh and about the Russian servers : the admins abuse and give themselves items and can spawn cars
                          and have huge abused bases so yea

Im getting tired so lets go to the Absolutely Horrible part:

                          1. You can glitch under the map , inside bases , trough every wall and you can make bases under the map. Well , for me its not a bad thing because im into raiding and i can go trough the map and search for bases that way ,or i can go trough walls and doors but i dont do that because whats the point of raiding if you dont break stuff right ?

                           So you wonder why is there a single point to the Horrible part ? Because there are many other horrible thing in this game. I cant list every one ;-;

                           But , if you can overcome all theese things and you still play after thoose things you can call yourself a veteran.

                           But seriously , play the game give it a chance its free and its a good game if you want to play it for fun.

                      I hope i helped some of you guys its my second review on a game so please be gentle =) and dont forget to not judge a game by its graphics because every game is special in some way (and if i get something wrong sorry)

                     Also BIG Thumbs Up to this game.


                      So my hand hurts , i'll leave you guys to play the game , good bye ;)
Possibly one of the best F2P games ever created. It's ran by a single person and gets weekly updated with tons of new features, fixes to bugs and glitches and constant community input. Nelson Sexton, the lone developer of this game has honestly made it one of my favourite games ever. You get the survival feel of Rust and DayZ while having goofy, blocky graphics which is probably what turns most people off but once you get into the game, you will never go back.
I've had this game since it started, I have also voted on Steam Greenlight for this game to be a thing, unlike Dayz Standalone-( four years in alpha ) Today marks the day when Unturned becomes a full game. I am so proud of this game and how far it has come in only 3 years. Well done to all the devs and everyone invloved in the creation of this awesome game. Keep up all the fantastic updates, and i can't believe this is still free! you devs are a bunch of great people! And i still never get bored on this game. I hear alot of people complaining about the Minecraft-ish graphics, well compare this to Dayz Standalone's Graphics, 
Dayz yeah.. some better graphics, BUT! Unturned has hardly any bugs and the game is so smooth, it makes me not think about the voxel graphics. Even though the graphics in Unturned are unique and beautiful. There is no reason for anyone to not have this downloaded as this is a MUST HAVE pc game. Smartly Dressed Games, Congratulations on everything! 
i'm so proud of what this has become. Never leave this game.
 Peace...
This is a really good game 1800+ and I still play it. 

Pros - 
You can find lots of friends
People are idiots sometimes(Is good and Bad)
Servers are decent 
Graphics won't kill your computer if it's too heavy lower game res
Pretty fun

Cons -
Community is full of diehard PVPers (I'm only good at PVp cause I have to fight them off)
People are pretty mean if you don't allow them to join your group
Servers Genres are kinda dying (Creative :( )
Rage quit is imminent
When you get bored You feel like playing but not playing at the same time

Whenever I do get Bored I just take a break. My last break was 6mths ago or 7 now idk play some other games then come back the gam efeels kind of fresh

This is my first Review Goodbye
Solid survival game. I wasn't very keen when I first tried it and felt lackluster because of my lack of knowledge towards the game. I later picked it back up and played with a friend who is miles more experienced than me and made the game fun for me.

I've only clocked about 40+ hours to this game as I'm writing this and I already love this game so much. Definitely in my top 5 games on my Steam library. That's quite a big statement to make, right? (But definitely not the first. Sorry! :P)

Crafting is very in-depth. Can be very difficult and fustrating at times. Takes awhile to memorize them. I'd still have to refere to the wiki every now and then.  The suvival aspect of this game is very challenge at first, but can be very fustrating later into the game, but surely it's miles easier than when we all first started playing this game. You always need to be wary of your hunger, hydration and sickness.

Building is very fustrating with the terrain around you. The land might look straight but nope, it's just slightly higher. You gotta find the perfect location. I suggest one should always prepare the materials a day before you want to build so you can focus whole heartedly into the build. Ain't nobody wants to stop halfway of their build to go chop more trees, right?

With almost *every* game, it's clearly better played with friends. Adds a lot more fun and speeds up process if you're building. I've never played PvP so I can't give you a good picture of that. Longer hours of playing this game is not recommended. Take 30 mins break every now and then. I once played this game 6 hours straight and felt very heavy and burnt out (was building a huge house). 

Summary/conclusion:
Ideal game if you just want to sit down, lay back and kill some zombies for a good 2 hours or 3. Anything exceeding 3 hours might just feel forced and heavy. Building is just a plus to this game. A very big PHAT plus. Nothing is more satisfying than you performing a headshot onto a zombie's head.  I hope you'll like this game as much as I do.
I honestly had no idea what to expect from this game when I first downloaded it. My first impression was some sort of DayZ and Minecraft mash up, and that is sort of what this game is. 

First off, don't let the graphics fool you. It is kind of cartoon-ish, but the gameplay is actually better than I thought it would be. 
In my opinion, to get the best experience out of this game, you need to play online with some friends. One of my favorite things is having to survive and gather supplies, all the while having to deal with other players who are likely trying to kill you. Its a very fun (and sometimes frustrating) experience. 

For being free, and a not fully developed game, this is very good. As far as gameplay issues/bugs go, I haven't really found that many, it runs very well. This is not a game that should be very computer intensive, so most people shouldn't have an issue running it on their computers, and that is another plus to this game. 

All in all, if you can't afford some of the zombie survival games out there like DayZ, or if your machine simply cannot run such games, this is a good alternative. 

10/10
Unturned is one of the best free survival game. You donot need beast pc to run it and almost everyone can play it. Game itself is realy enjoyable and fun. I want to say big thanks to Nelson (Developer of game). He works so hard to improve Game. I love Unturned. (Sorry for my English)
Did anyone else decide to love this game from simply reading the system specs?
It helped me to determine which model of toaster I needed to play: Toast/10
This game really did the unexpected... Nelson really did a good job with this game, it feels like its a full game(cause it is) and it has so many learning curves. So its like Rust(if yo've evr play Rust) you start at the beach with nothing and you go to your nearest town/"major" location to get a gun or weapon if your lucky enough because if your playing on a 24/7|OP KITS|1000X then its most likey that your not ready for these types of servers, you should start of by doing the turtorial and then going on the singleplayer to learn bullet drop and loot spawns, then if you want stay as a singleplayer to never see another real person (because Nelson made bots/NPC's) or you can be a MAN and go onto multiplayer and do some hardcore pvp or... r... r.. RP!The only problem I have with Unturned is RP it takes away from the survival charm and replacing it with nothing but... HE KOS HE KOS HE KOS, but I still play on Rp servers sometime because im having a hard time getting started on a survival server or I just feel like Rp'ing, so I still like them but Nelson should make a whole new catagory/catagorys called Survival and Rp so people dont click on a random server not knowing which it is, the modding commuity helps Nelson and supports him(to me at least), they make skins and tons more stuff.

I would like to finish off this "long" review by saying.
Nelson I think you inspried many people and after Unturned || or 4 or what ever your gonna call it, the game is really gonna be done with bug and glitch patchs here and then.

Thank you for reading this review.
Scunt
I love this game if ur searching for a survival game this is the one! But everyone use this game as pvp. If ur with the campfire in the wildernis ur not scared from zombies but from players. No worry about that Nelson is making unturned 4.0 also know as unturned 2 and its focussed on pve. For me the best survival map is yukon becuz its extra hard ;) sorry for my bad english i like this game af.
Love this game so much and i love diverse community everyone is Awesome :)

Pros:
Free-to-play
Like Dayz and rust with out needing a great graphics card.
Pvp is Fun and fast
Updated frequently

Cons:
Not optimized well

It's free why not*
I played this game when i got my first computer when i was twelve. currently i have 359 hours on this game between two accounts because i lost the other one.when my parents got divorced my dad moved out because my mother won over the house. we lived in a small apartment where i shared a room with my sister and also go my first Xbox with my first ever cod game COD Bo3 why i bring this up is that i was a hurt twelve year old that usually spent a lot of time in his room by himself.. i played this game a lot of the time span until we moved out. this game made me a lot of friends and gave me a break from all the suffering that occurd in that relic of my memories. I will never forget the great impact this game had on me.
Neat game especially for the price.  Singleplayer lets you get use to the game as far as combat vs zombies.  Survival aspect is fun and challenging.  Secrets to dig out and on some maps NPCs that give you simple quests.  Online aspect is a good time at least as far as PvE. PvP can be rough, but challenging as established players/groups will smack you down as a new player.  All in all a good game, hours of fun and the reason I nominated it for 2 catagories is the developer is still very actively working on it, and it's future replacement.  How can you go wrong for free?  You can't, grab this game.
Been playing this game for 4 years i love it so much!
Nothing to say its just amazing if you like survival and games that are different!
Amazing game!
This is one of the most pure games ever to be made. It has plenty of bugs and does not run as well as it probably should but Nelson (Smartly Dressed Games) is very receptive to feedback and the gameplay mechanics are good.
Pros:
If you can gather the right group of allies and the right weapons this game can be a blast.
Cool system of base building.
Many Many Different Weapons.
Cool crafting mechanics.
Can play for hours at a time if you get the right stuff to stay alive.
Cool food wearing out system.
Nice Cars if you can find them.

Cons:
Zombies tend to hit you from a giant distance away.
Lack of many cars in maps.
Sometimes gets stuck in barrels where you cant hit something but it can hit you.


Overall, I think it is an amazing game but could use a tiny bit of tweaking here and there, but if you are a hardcore sombie survival fan like i am, you will love this game.
Great game indeed... hosted a server, met some great people, has a great community including the workshop, has minor bugs, and is a great game for online interaction. There are maps for all types of computers, small maps such as Hawaii and large maps such as Russia which is four times the size of them small maps. Graphics on the game can expand on a scale of low to ultra so it can be played on most computers and some laptops.

-So how well is the gameplay?-
Interface: Very simplistic, easy to learn, and gives a great outlook on the game. The game has a very helpful tutorial world which tells you all the basics including interface information which makes it even easier to learn. Your screen will turn grey when you are low on health as well.

Singleplayer: Better with friends but if you are looking for a solo game then this is a great game for that. Building bases and gathering a sum of vehicles make the game interesting for a very long time so it attracts you for quiet a while.

Pay to win: Not at all... you can buy the "Permanent Gold Upgrade" if you want more accessories and "Gold" servers which allow you to have less hackers in the game. Battle-eye usually catches hackers so it is no problem at all.

Online interaction: There are servers for RP, surviving, and killing other players... so if you want to get on a RP server to find some people to hang out with then you can. Once you have a group of friends you can head over to a PvP server and group together. All together the game seems pretty good for online interaction, probably one of the best.

Crafting: Pretty simple and easy to get along with, it is nice to use for all types of servers.

Vehicles: Can be a little bumpy but in all the vehicles are great for traveling and running over people or zombies. If you want to upgrade your car then you can add barbed-wire, metal or wood, and even workshop parts to it! The customizing is to an extent of almost anything you can think of for a vehicle.

Content in total: This game is great for videos for your own server or any server in total. If you are on a single-player world or your own server you can use different camera angles (Shift + F1-F8). These different camera angles make it pretty great for the production of videos. If you wanted to green screen something then you can get a green screen room in the workshop and make some great scenes. There are a lot of things you can do to furnish in your game... there are also workshop mods to add more! You can also buy skins, get skin crates, or even earn skins by playing a long time. Over all the game has maximum customizing just because of this.
Really fun game for when your internet providers are so stupid that they cut your internet out for no reason, even though you've paid for internet.
10/10 for saving me from certain death because of no internet for a week.
This is a great game you can get for free, although there are a few flaws. I used to be a pvp god spending most of my time on a server called plastic warfare before it became a modded mess. The gameplay is fun and addictive. This might be one of the few games you spend a couple hundred hours on. The pvp is fun and rewarding, but there is one fatal flaw... this allowed the game to grow, but attract the wrong fanbase... the game is free. Now, im not saying it shouldn't be free, the only reason it is successful is probably because it is free. But, free games attract children. And children want no challenge. There is a extreme lack of good servers. The only servers you'll find are 10x servers and rp servers with op kits that you won't get to use. Hopefully 4.0 might fix this issue. Oh, i almost forgot... the workshop mods! You'll find a lot of workshop mods and maps, and hopefully there's one of them you'll like. Can't find any maps? Make your own. It's extremely easy to make your own maps, and a tiny bit harder to add zombies and items to them but 60 minutes and a online tutorial is all you need to make your first map.
Its a fun game u MUST try.

Its good for every computer and can be played on laptops with no problems.
I as well played it on my old laptop for 500 hours since i got a new PC to play with and still had fun with the game.
So i played it more and more xd
Now after nearly 1100 hours its kind of boring because you can kill nearly everyone without any problems.
The community are mostly little kids who dont know how to play.
I would still recommend this game for SURE. You have to try it out for yourself.
Its a great game for you and your friends and i promise you you are going to have great fun in this game.. for at least 1100 hours :D

Its also free to play, so a big + from me.
Good free to play game that reminds me of rust, but more block style. There is a lot you can do like build bases, play with friends and allot more. The games workshop is fantastic and there is always something interesting. hope you will like it.
It's a little sad I waited so long to review this game. I was one of the people that joined in EARLY 3.0. The singleplayer by itself, is pretty good. Survival mechanics are easy to learn, but it hasn't been as improved on as it could have. Still, the game is appealing graphically and audibly, and it makes for a good time if you can get some friends. One thing I can say is, the multiplayer is the side of Unturned I don't really go on. PVP is nice every once in awhile, but it's different when that's what over 50% of the servers are. But this isn't completely the developer(s)'s fault, or a bad thing. The community wants what it wants. Yet, we've been losing some of our more dedicated players, and that's why I really want there to be more survival-related updates instead of just combat based tweaks. I adore this game, but I hope that no matter how many changes are made in 4.0, I will still get the mechanics and aspects of Unturned that I, and even some veterans from 2.0, can enjoy, as we see it all move into UE4.
Unturned is a one of those DayZ inspired games with the community calling it "A DayZ + Minecraft Style game" which we hardly get nowadays. It contains some bits of RUST style building mechanics, and the graphics are AMAZING when placed on the highest level of detail. And the best part, it's free.
The game is a must try, and while it's still on early access, there's more stuff to come into it.
Add me on unturned first on steam then dm on discord sargent tony#0474 then we can 2v2 and unturned is sick go download it may players lets gooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Unturned is probably the best free-to-play game I have ever played. I recommend it to anyone who loves doing whatever they feel like doing. There are endless possibilities in this amazing sandbox full of creative people!
I recommend this game.
PvP is really funny.
I am so excited about Unturned II, like everyone who played this game.
In this game is a lot of possibilities like pvp, pvm,building and others
10/10

All I can say is "wow". A free game that I've spent my first fifty-three hours only playing one map (PEI)? Zero micro-transactions, just a one-time optional five bucks to the dev? Square zombies getting wasted with square guns outside the square base I built? Yes, please.

At least twelve more available maps plus tonnes of workshop content that I haven't even looked at means I'll never get away from this game. There are unique things to craft and find on each map, and there is a very well-implemented progression system both for player stats as well as the exploration system. It's almost like you organically "finish" maps by crafting everything and seeing every location, but you'll still want to go back and work on your castle. And this is all only on single player!! Multiplayer is a whole 'nother ball game, with PVE, PVP, RP, BR, + more. I gladly gave the $5.49 CAD to the dev for this extremely solid entry into the genre.
The game, despite being very similar to a mix of DayZ and Minecraft, is entertaining for the younger aged players. Obviously the game comes with a gore option which I wouldn't recommend for players under 14 or without parental permission. The graphics are pretty good, the gameplay is smooth, never has any FPS drops below 100, so in all fairness, it's a great game and I would generally recommend the game.
This game is amazing I'm really excited for 4.0 and being able to play multiplayer and single player is quire fun because you want to explore a map then you can download it on the workshop or just place it in single player if its an official map or currated
Unturned is a zombie survival game made by a person in their basement as a project ended up being a great game that many can enjoy. There are pros and cons to unturned.
Pros
-This game is great with friends
-Game allows you to meet new people 
-A lot of customisation one can purchase
-Unturned has a single player mode

Cons
-There have been many reports about cheaters on the game
-Many servers within unturned are quite pay to win as it consists of donator packages a person 
-Can be boring if you play solo
This is the best free game ever created. So much content! People complain about the character models, but I like how derpy they look. There is so much to explore. Plus, mulitplayer. I would be happy paying 5 dollars for this game, and giving the dev the money he deserves for all the work put into it. This is an amazing game. Those who don't have it, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? INSTALL IT!
I LOVE THIS GAME. I have over 2k hours on this game. Full survival with multiplayer just changes the fact that this is amazing. I recommend for people that like survival. There are many maps, Vehicles, Guns, Foods, stories, and much more. Totally one of my favorite games from when I started gaming. I would like this game but more realistic but although it's good game :)
A lot of weirdly unused items and vehicles. A lot of posibilities for a great game but let down by the lack of gameplay depth. Was fun with friends for a couple of hours.

ROBLOX DUH
Really fun game, including single player, and multiplayer, and it has a whole lot of guns and assets that you can mess around with. If you ever get tired of the bloodshed in the PvP servers, there are plenty of roleplay servers that you can have as much fun.

10/10 would play again
Its probably the best free, zombie survival game made. Its a game which has had much love and care put towards it by the developer and community. As long as you can get passed the minecraftian graphics this has the potential for 1000's of hours of gameplay.
İts a cool game for the ones who like an experience of challenge and survival at the same time. The combat whit players are sometimes may be fun and intense but the fun that comes from wining a hard fight is always very nice.
A very good, simple zombie game that has become more stable with the new Unity update. Interesting building system, with separate crafting section for barricades. My only complaint is that none of the signs are smaller, because  I want to organize my armory with small labels. Shooting feels very good, max settings looks good (for the art style), runs well on most things. My personal most played game, as well as my first Steam download.
for the mac, the update made the game look more faded and more glitchy. i cannot run a single world because it is stuck on the loading screen. unturned used to be an enjoyable game for mac users, but now i can't even play.
I used to love this game so much a few years ago, but now its a trash heap. There are so many bugs and glitches, a terrible community, and no new aspects other than pvp crap. I even got a bug where I cannot join any servers whatsoever, and I have had this bug for a whole YEAR. Look, I understand it is made by one person, but I am not going to recommend this game until he fixes this mess.
Well i played this game before on a different account and i liked it!The game had a great community and i would never get bored.But now F*** this its just servers ran by 10 year olds and you cant find a normal server with normal people.Its mostly just pvp with kids who get angry when you kill them.And singleplayer well it was fun but  when the  zombies start chasing you they  just stop at an invisible border!!And they just stand in one place waiting for something to happen so basicly its not fun and its too easy!So yeah i dont recommend this game at all.
This game needs a big fix to it, when joining non modded servers it says "needs a custom barricade asset" and even after checking the files everything seems to be in order , nothing works pls fix nelson the game is currently unplayable
So stupid. I had somebody make a steam account and spend $5.00 so he could add me. We thought multiplayer meant like we could play privately, but nope. Just a bunch of server crap.Wasted 2 hours. Is it that hard to make private multiplayer?
I thought it was great. Spent over a hundred hours on it, at one point. If I reviewed this game 2 years earlier, it would be a resounding thumbs up.

I however cannot enjoy this game like I used to; a problem lying with the community. It saddens me to give this a thumbs down, but it has to be done.

You had a good run, Unturned. A real good run.
This game is absolutely trash... controls are awful, servers are unpopulated, and I accidentally shot my brother in the head because i thought he was a zombie 10/10 would kill him again.
