50 Hours into your latest save, all is going well. Only 3 leaders left Gandhi, Caesar and Washington.
you draft an 'end game' plan in your mind, you will make friends with Gandhi (for obvious reasons he's chill) then procede to befriend Caesar.

Then you will take out Washington because he is a dick and did not accept an open border agreement 3000 years prior HE MUST PAY. 20 turns later all is going to plan, we are now on Washingtons doorstep, Gandhi and Caesar appear to love and probably fear your superpower nation. All we need to do is eliminate the pesky Americans and ith all our military now on American soil this should not take long.

Then after the swift invasion of America we will make a vote for world peace at the U.N (in rome of course) with our new found Indian and Roman brethren it is a sure win!
But all of a sudden the distant droning of nuclear sirens start, quickly they become louder and louder, "what is this!?" you think to yourself, a false alarm? You shrug it off maybe Caesae bombing a city state.

The game pauses... Gandhi appears on the screen, with a sinister grin he shouts "WAR" in your face. Only seconds after you see a gut wrenching sight. The camera focuses on a nuclear submarine stationed just off the coast of your pride and joy, the capital of your glorious nation.

You then hear a rumble, just seconds after a nuclear warhead emerges from the previously hidden submarine, you realise it is too late... you can only watch as the missle closes in. As your city goes up in a giant cloud there are short lived screams from your beloved people, then silence. 

Before what had just occurred had sunk in, before you could make rescue efforts to save your much loved citizens the  humming of quiet engines fall upon your ears. Suddenly countless 'stealth bombers' appear seemingly out of no where, soon the sky is blackened by planes, the game falls almost silent only the whistle of falling bombs remains. You faint from the shock of what is unfolding.

You awake shortly after, Gandhi is still flattening what remains of your once prosperous empire, now with 'giant death robots' making the most of his seemingly never ending turn. As Gandhi clinically and relentlessly razes what's left of your broken nation all you can do is weep, your people hacked down in their prime and  your glorious nation so mighty just minutes before has just been been all but eliminated in 1 turn. 

Why oh why did you turn of autosave? did it really speed your game up? was it worth it?

Ghandi is a complete asshole, he acts like your friend but WILL nuke the shit out of you if even the slightest oppurtunity presents itself. 10/10
This is the best Civilization up to this point, and the DLC just made it even better. I will grant that the with all the add ons it would feel a tad crowded to anyone who hadn't played it before, but you have a crazy amount of options. The game series tagline of "one more turn" could not be more applicable.

You can strive for one of several victories: diplomatic, cultural, technological or domination. Each has its unique challengers to overcome and create a lot of the fun of the game. They are also not necessarily mutually exclusive and after completing one victory, you can go for the others. Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.

There are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. 

This game is easily worth the money. I'm not entirely sure how it stacks up to Civilization VI, but any game that I log 200+ hours on over a period of years and still haven't come close to doing everything is doing something right. A great game from a great series.
You'll decide to play for an hour and you'll realize four days later that your wife left you, but you're so close to killing that scumbag Gandhi that it doesn't even matter. 20/10
Love this game, I bought it for my grandpa originally and he played it non stop til he passed away. I believe he had around 600+ hours on it. So from a 66 year old to a now 17 year old collectively enjoy this game.
This was the account i set up for him also but then he gave me the computer in his will and i kept it going.

10/10 would flee the world on a spaceship again.






I am the peaceful nation of the Celts.

We shall be the nation of religion, and of diplomacy.

This went well; we ended up next to the Babylonians, and we expanded nicely in peace. However, I have always believed in "dibs", so I placed down Glasgow onto the land between us, to provide a little buffer. They seemed annoyed by this. A few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years, but otherwise, nothing too bad happened.

In order to spread our religion further (because we were known for our Confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster), we begin to invest in boats. Soon we covered the oceans in missionaries, Inquisitors, and warriors to help defend our religious allies.

Babylon was making friends with a local city state, Genoa. However, they were trying to spread Zoroastrianism; those heathens! Despite both our religions being known for their peace, we passive-aggressively sent missionary and Inquisitor to Genoa. Over the course of about 700 years, we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions; those same Warriors had been given spears now, but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders.

I offer Babylon some sugar for their spice; they wanted my sugar, iron, coal and all of my money. I then asked Germany if they wanted sugar for spice; they accepted.

North of me, Rome had begun a war with France. Due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade, I found myself with a huge amount of money. Everytime France and Rome made peace, I knew that Rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes. So I bought... I gifted many city states my religion and gold, and then I bought... gifted France and Germany enough money to declare with with Rome.

While they fought, my Spearmen (now Musketmen) continued to glare with Babylon's, and we continued our 1500 year religious passive-aggression over Genoa. They said I was spying on them; I said I wouldn't. When my spies returned, I sent them back to Babylon. A squad of 5 Great Prophets charged into Babylon, converting left, right and centre. Babylon complained I was being a bit aggressive. I apologised. I then sent more missionaries to Babylon.

I had now found every single Civilization; we decided to have a United Nations meeting in 1600A.D. I, as the host, gave everyone a single vote. Except myself. I gave myself 16, due to my popularity. I declared my religion to be the world religion. Every one opposed. I listened to their opinions, and then passed it anyway. When Rome got angry about this, I then paid France to declare war again. When Babylon got angry, I then paid Rome to declare war on them.

My civilians were amazingly happy; hugely more than any other place. But because I was an Emperor, they declared me Declis the Terrible; despite my universal healthcare, happy citizens, peaceful religion, not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word. My army consisted of mostly my friends, my city states, and my Musketmen (now Great War Infantry) continued to glare at the Babylonian Great War Infantry, after 2000+ years. A great duty to my nation, their descendants shall continue to frown at the Babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall.

Eventually we reached a grand United Nations meeting; I sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 City State friends, and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side. I said that the People's Confucian Republican Empire of Scotland was the best nation in the world.

They all voted against me. I smiled, and then declared I won anyway.

Democracy is overrated. Freedom of religion only applies to my religion. I don't need to be stronger when I'm more popular (and my people are probably more beautiful). And if you don't like me, I'll pay your best friend to backstab you.

Through this, I came to understand American foreign policy. So Civilization is if nothing else, an educational tool.
CAN'T.....STOP.....PLAYING......ARRRGGGG!!!!

Very addictive and deep!  It has grown wonderfully over the years and has GREAT support from the Steam Workshop.  Endless replayability!

If you are new to the series, have no worries.  Good ol' Sid will do you no wrong, as the tutorials will have you conquring Mongol Hordes and smacking down Washington's smarmyness in no time flat!  Hours will fly by and your social life WILL suffer!!  If you are a vetran of the series and have been holding out, check out the two expantion packs which add many interesting dynamics to gameplay easily making this the most exciting and in depth of the franchise.

I've had several friends sit down at my screen and start a new game, dispite them groaning about it not being an action game or something like Candy Crush (We all know the types!).  Needless to say, coming back and seeing how they were doing 3+ hours later and noticing that they havn't changed position on their chair, has always been a moment that makes me smile.  I have spread the addiction!!!  Huzzah!

Do yourself a favor.  Play this game.
As a Native American I was glad to finally see a game that accurately portrays our culture. I will never forget the day we built the pyramids on a grassland hill, or who could forget when we used mega death robots to destroy the incan empire for  trying to convert our cities to Confuciacism. 10/10.
Civilization V is not a new game.  On the contrary, it's almost seven years ago.  Its sequel, Civilization VI, has been out for almost a year.  Despite that, I find myself repeatedly coming back to Civilization V to get my 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) strategy game fix.  Having gotten back on a Civilization kick this past week or so, I plan to review Civilization VI before too long, but before I do, I thought it would be good to go back to the game that got me full-on addicted to the series.

Civilization puts you in the role of the leader of a budding civilization, having you build from a single settler unit and a warrior unit to - hopefully - a massive empire turning the world green with envy with your religion, culture, science, economy, and military might.  The base game includes 18 unique civilizations, each with their own unique units, traits, strengths, and weaknesses.  There are two major expansions that add an additional 18 civilizations along with a few more minor DLC packs that add another seven civilizations for a grand total of 43.  It's not just the in-game differences that make these civilizations unique but the detail that went into them; every civilization leader is fully animated and complete with lines of dialogue spoken in the leader's native tongue.  For example, when interacting with the Romans, you'll see Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, fully animated with lines recorded in Latin.  When interacting with the Aztecs, you'll see Moctezuma I (no, that's not a typo) speaking Nahuatl.  While it's not exactly a work of historical fact, obviously, as a history teacher, the amount of detail that went into the leaders and their presentation makes me absolutely giddy.

Civilization V offer five different paths of victory.  Of course, you have the tried and true domination victory in which you must crush your enemies.  As of the Brave New World expansion, you must control all players' original capitals including your own to achieve a domination victory, meaning that you could technically win through domination without actually wiping out a single civilization.  Leaving them alive, however, will obviously give them incentive to retaliate and rid their capital of your filth.  You also have the option of a science victory, requiring you to complete certain research projects, build, and be the first to launch a starship to Alpha Centauri.  Cultural victory involves making your culture so vibrant and desirable through various policy upgrades (that, in turn, end up influencing your Tourism) that other civilizations' citizenry all start to prefer your culture over any other.  Diplomatic victory involves progressing to the point where the World Congress is created and then develops into the United Nations.  From there, you must attain enough votes from your own delegates as well city-states or - if they have no sense of self-preservation - other empires to be elected "world leader" by the UN.  The last victory type is the time or score victory.  Unless this victory type is disabled, whoever has the highest total score by 2050 AD (that's turn 500 on standard speed) is the winner.  Score is determined by pretty much everything - gold in your treasury, units you possess, research you've done, territory you control, the number of cities in your empire, the population of your empire....it's an exhaustive list, but the idea is straightforward - the highest score wins.  Of these various victory types, cultural is probably the most obscure due to the less-than-straightforward relation between the culture that generates your policy upgrades and the tourism stat that actually triggers the victory.

My favorite thing about Civilization is that it can be as confrontational as you want it to be.  If you want to, you can start wrecking shit right off the bat.  If you're more into the empire building aspect than the empire conquering aspect like me, you can build up your empire relatively peacefully, maintaining just a defensive army (or no army) and focusing on science, culture, and city growth.  Diplomacy, while having some flaws in Civ V, allows for relatively peaceful interactions as well as confrontation with various trade options and a few different kinds of pacts you can pursue with other nations.  Making all of this better is the option of playing online with a mix of people and CPUs.  My favorite thing to do is play with a couple of friends and handful of computer players and - hopefully - keep a relatively cooperative, peaceful relationship with my human counterparts.  It's a lot like Risk in that there are some backroom deals going on but unlike Risk, avoiding confrontation is a perfectly viable option.

Civilization V was, in my opinion, the absolute pinnacle of strategy game perfection at the time of its release.  As my first "main" Civilization game (excluding the spin-off Civilization Revolution), it's secured both a very special place in my heart as well as the status of being my primary point of reference when playing any other Civilization or 4X strategy game.  While there are a few areas that I think could have been improved, it's still a definite masterpiece of strategy design.  The detail of the maps, the variety of strategic and luxury resources to claim and exploit, the diplomatic aspects, the number of different victory types, and the diverse array of civilizations from which to choose all make this game truly mind blowing when you stop and think about it.  If you have any interest at all in strategy games, I'd give this one a go.  With Civilization VI having been on the market for nearly a year, Civ V isn't too pricey these days, and it's still an amazing experience, and that's even before you take into account the various (and often hilarious) mods on the Steam Workshop that you can download.  Of all the games I've recommended, this is one of the most highly recommended, hands down.
Made me obsessed, destroyed my social life, gave me and irrational fear of Gandhi. and made me invest countless hours into destroying civilizations. 12/10 potatoes

great game 8.5/10
Unlike my other reviews, this one is not going to be a detailed one because just about [i]everybody[/i] and their dog knows how amazing this game is, so instead?

Instead, I'm gonna tell a story.

Once upon a time, a nerdy, white, bespectacled kid with Autism had his parents divorce. The father was a former alcoholic who would (sadly) get a year in jail. Even so, despite his flaws, the son loved his father, and the father was a loving parent when he was around, which was rare as he moved to Boston, Massachusets. But one day, when he was 18-years old, he finally got the opportunity to stay with him in Boston for a week, much to his mother's regret.

So he brought with him his gaming laptop to play his recently-purchased Civilization V, which everybody was gushing over how amazing it was. The boy was playing as Denmark (he loves axes) and he just wrapped up his invasion against India, when his father told the boy to go to bed at 9:00 - yes, even when an adult, he still doesn't mind going to bed early.

But at 2:00 AM, the boy couldn't sleep, so he snuck downstairs and smuggled his gaming laptop upstairs to play more Civilization V. Everything was fine, until suddenly, the boy's father snuck upstairs, clearly hearing everything.

"What are you doing up at [i]this[/i] time? It's the middle of the night."

Clearly seeing his disappointment, the boy blushed. "Um... Civilization V?"

Instead of being utterly disappointed, the boy's father laughed - not out of condenscendation, but out of joy.

"Wh-What's so funny?"

"Nothing," The father laughed. "You're exactly like your old man, you know that?"

He took the boy downstairs to his work place, and booted up the computer.

He smiled mischievously at the boy. The computer had Civilization V on it.

"Wanna have some good times with your old man?"

The boy smiled ear-to-ear. "Would I."

For one whole week - and fortuitous timing, since the father was on break - the father and the son played hours upon hours of Civilization V all the way until late in the night for a whole week. Even when the mother had to pick up the son eventually, the week-long fun and 81 hours of gameplay time was far more than enough for the memories to last forever. He knew he wouldn't be able to see his father for a while, but he knew that - despite his flaws, despite his former-alcoholism and arrest - the father would still love the son, and the feeling would always be mutual.

[spoiler]Thanks for the memories, Dad. I'll always love you, no matter what.[/spoiler]
A year after the Civ VI release, and this game is still better.

HIGHLY recommended you buy the complete edition. The expansions in this game really do make it that much better.

I also recommend you install a high quality balance mod. Without one, you're pretty much forced to run the Tradition and Rationalism policy trees EVERY game.
I don't have a lot of hours put in, so I suppose I should instead describe my third game rather than give a review.

4000 B.C. 
Just chilling with my austrian settlers and warriors.
A little nervous because it's my first time playing on Normal difficulty, I think it was called Prince or King.

Here we go.

Establish my city, begin constructing my monument, and predetermine my Technology route to Education. I'm in it for the long game baby.
Set my warriors to auto explore, find two ruins in a row that boost them up to pikeman. 
They encounter camp after camp, steamrolling through them to discover a bunch of city states. 

Get two policies real quick.

Finally meet my first civ.
It's Ghandi.
I played with him before, he was pretty chill.

100 turns later.

I've met Washington, Sejong, the russians, Ghenghis Khan, England, two native american dudes, and Nepolian. Some minor skirmishes, but I've been focusing my tech so I've avoided war.

Everyone's kind of cool, my economy is strong, and I'm ahead of everyone by an entire era. Only problem is my army is a little weaker.

Approaching 1300 A.D.

Diplomatic Marriage a city state right on the border of Russia.

She denounces me.
wellfuckyoutoothen

I never liked her anyway, so I denounce her back.

She declares war. 

I laugh as my six city state allies and three civ friends all declare war on her.

I don't have to be strong, I just have to have a lot of friends. 

Watch with glee as they all advance on her, decimating her four cities and clearing out her capital. 

I make sure I always have one unit to take the final hit so I can capture the city.
She cries in defeat and curses my name, and I happily swallow her empire.

1500 A.D.

Getting kinda bored just switching units around and building things, so I declare war on Sejong just because.
Uh oh.
I fucked up big.
He had a lot of friends.

England, the two native americans, and Washington all declare war on me.

Ghengis had been wiped out early by Sejong because he was a greedy piece of shit.

I had stopped caring about the city-state thing, so I only have one ally there. 
My only friend is Ghandi.

Because I've got a leaping start on my tech, I quickly research up to musketmen. 
1600 A.D., and swarms of cannons and musketmen rush to protect my empire.

It's a long and hard battle, I lose a city, I reclaim it and take someone elses, over and over. 

Ghandi has already sued for peace, he's been beaten and broken. 
It's me against the world.

Thankfully I had a reserve of gold, so purchasing troops isn't a problem.

Finally, it's 1800 A.D.
After 200 years of war, I've come out on top.
It's just me, Ghandi, and Nepolian. 

My economy is strong, my army is huge, but my people aren't very happy.
Revolts happen every two turns, so I have all of my cities focused on building recreational buildings, i.e. zoos and circuses, etc. etc.
Falling behind in building

1900 A.D.

Nepolian and me are squaring off on each other, denouncing one another whenever possible and picking policies just to spite the other.

I see at the corner of my screen that a spy has stolen secrets, so I immediately declare war on Nepolean. Don't know if it was him, but at the same time I do, the short little shit. 

It's a short war, all of my troops roll over to America and crush him. 

I don't really understand the whole Ghandi hate, he's pretty chill. He helps me out whenever he can, and lent me some troops to fight the french douche.

1950

A notification pops up that I almost miss.

"Ghandi has completed the Manhattan Project".

Good for him, I'm still 11 turns away from it, trying to even out my tech tree. Maybe we can progress through the game and tie at a science victory, I don't know, I was naive then.

A few turns pass, and I've completed the Manhattan Project, and have mined all the uranium available.

Immediately Ghandi's smiling face pops up on my screen, greeting me and offering a shit load of resources and gold for Uranium.

Warmed by the generosity over some silly old Uranium, I give it to him for just 10 gold extra a turn.
Ghandi and I are friends, friends help each other.

1970.

All of my troops are in the ocean, coming back to the mainland.

And then it happens.
The thing I never thought would.
Ghandi's smiling face, which I had once thought held nothing but gentle warmth and kindness, now twisted in a sadistic grin. 

He's declaring war.

In horror I watch as his troops move into my borders, storming my enormous empire now completely defenseless due to my war with France. 

And then I hear them.
Oh God did I hear them.

The sirens.

They flew in slow motion from his bases, moving like some horrible, terrible metallic bird of brey over my cities. I watch on helplessly, powerless to stop them.

And then the flash.

My entire screen goes white, and I hear the screams as the blast eradicates my citizens. 
I watch the health plummet, the green 15's and 20's down to 0. I see the smoke and fog curling from my lands, radiation bleaching it of life.

I finally storm onto the beaches of my once flourishing empire, but it's too late. 

Ghandi has taken over.

He begins to systematically erase my troops, before sailing over seas and taking over the Americas. 

And finally, finally I understand why the Ghandi fear existed.



10/10, would be betrayed by Ghandi again.
Me: Hey Gandhi wanna be friends?
Gandhi: Yes, let the world be envious of our friendship

*200 turns go by*
Gandhi has constructed the Manhattan project
Me: Oh it will be okay
*3 turns later*
Gandhi: To be honest, I never really liked you. So it is time for you to die. (aka Declares war)

*Gets nuked by Gandhi*

 11.342/10 would get nuked again
> build the Great Wall of Portugal
> lose the nuclear arms race to Gandhi
> bring the tenets of Judaism to every corner of Germany
> construct the Great Pyramids of Honolulu
> make Ethiopia the most well fed civilization in the world
> share your Crabs with friends to make them happy

10/10, would give Crabs to Queen Isabella again.


This is a warning. This game is too much fun and should not be played before you go to bed. 
There have been times where my friends or I think we have only played for 1 hour and only look at the clock only to realise we have played for over 8 hours and it is 4am in the morning. 
Should you get this game?
Yes.
Will this game mess with your sense of time?
Yes it will.
my fathers go-to while he does his dialysis treatments, which explains the 5,400+ hours of gameplay. why does he only pick USA? patriotism? i don't know.
You'll keep telling yourself, "Just one more turn," or "I can't get off while I'm at war," and then suddenly you'll realize it's four in the morning, you haven't written that paper for college, you have class in four hours, and you haven't slept at all. 10/10. Would recommend for that procrastinator in your life.
Gandhi declares war on Bismarck's German Empire. 

Soon after, Gandhi strikes Berlin, Hamburg, and Essen with Nuclear Missiles.

The Ottomans, concerned with Gandhi's warmongering, denounce the Indian leader.

They soon lose their capital.

Bismarck, his economy and army in ruins,  pleads for peace with the Indian Empire, but Gandhi will only stop with full annexation of the German Reich.

An alliance of Poland, Gengis Khan's Mongolian Empire, and the Aztecs turn on Gandhi in hopes of stopping his rampage.

Warsaw falls.

Karakorum falls.

Tenochtitlan falls.

Gandhi reins supreme. The world is in his grasp. He is on the verge of doing what men, for thousands of years, have dreamed of: Conquering the world under one banner.

But none of that matters, because the Babylonians have just won a science victory by launching a single little rocket into space. It makes too much sense.

10/10, but be warned:

Gandhi will find you.

Gandhi will kill you.

And Gandhi

Always

Gets

His

Kill.
Having not a great deal of experience with previous Civilization games, I was expecting myself to find this installment of the series hard to get the hang of, imagining myself spending hours trying to work out how to start up a civilization that will "stand the test of time". Instead, I found the game to be extremely helpful and newbie-friendly. Like other strategy games, you learn the basics then gradually build up a better understanding of the game and its mechanics, feeling more and more like a pro with every minute gone by. After about four hours playing I felt pretty confident, but even today I am learning things I never knew or had any comprehension of in the game. The simplicity which has been introduced to help newcomers coupled with the fact that the game maintains the same look and feel with older generations is a really positive thing that was pulled off very well.

The game offers serious levels of depth due to the vast number of playable races, multiple methods to seek victory and the ability to play on completely randomly generated maps every game, with available templates to choose from if so desired. I have only played a handful of games right to the very end since they can last for many days, especially if each session isn't particularly long. Every game feels very different to the next, providing this title with a lot of replayability.

The AI is sometimes criticised but I think that it is well done in this game with a large range of difficulty levels to choose from, ranging from literally zero experience to the grandmaster level. They can often be somewhat unpredictable but I personally see that as a good thing, I mean, what's the point in playing such an in-depth strategic game like Civilization V when you can anticipate what the AI will most likely do? Part of the magic of this game is that it immerses you into the position of a leader, facing situations where you have to make decisions on the spot with no idea what your opponent is going to do.

Overall this is a great game worthy of your money, but I would advise waiting for it to come on sale as it frequently does, it isn't the newest game in the world either.
Civilization V is the thinking man's game. It doesn't require lightning reflexes, speed or precision, however it is probably one of the most complex games ever created.

You're able to pick one of many civilizations to guide from 4000BC to the Present, allowing you to shape their culture, military and economic structure among others. You control everything, from where to build a city, how you allocate resources, scientific research, religion, espionage, tourism, corporations, and more.

The game has an extremely intricate diplomacy system as well which allows for you to befriend or antagonize the other civilizations. There are multiple ways to win a game, allowing for multiple play-styles.

As someone who has been playing the Civilization games for over 20 years, I strongly recommend Civilization V with all of its DLC.

Civilization V has also made our list for the top 35 games of the generation. To see where it ranks, here's the video:

Civ 5 is the kind of game where you can try to be nice and befreind everyone, but you will get denounced. they will murder your people and pillage your cities. When you attempt to fight back you are labeled a warmonger, and obviously the only way to stop getting warmonger penalties is to slaughter all those that oppose you right? If you destroy 1 civ might as well destroy them all because they will not let you live that down. Also Ghandi Destroyer of worlds will wreck you if you don't give him all your uranium for him to build nukes to nuke you with. 10/10 would fight Ghandi Destroyer of Worlds again
what can I say. This is my  GO TO game when I get tired of playing other games. I havwe been playing Civ since the very firdt one came out and for turn based stategy you cannot get a better game
121 hours in and I have no thought to stop playing this game, really great.

Pros:
- Games last a long time and there's lots of variety per civilization and its playstyle, almost impossible to have a similar game you've had before.
- Combat system very simple
- VERY FUN
- Good for history geeks

1/2Pro 1/2 Con
- Might need to do some research on some subjects within the game, not sure if this is bad in some people's opinions, but it can be intriguing for me.

Cons: 
- Once you're 100 hours in or so, it becomes more boring by yourself and you usually need friends.
- DLC is (almost) necessary, it makes it much more fun and the game is a lot more dry without it (Without DLC it's still great though).

Sleep-destroyer...

If I don't have at least 10 hours in front of me I don't start Civ V. 

Technically I Can save and reload whenever I want. 

But in reality, I can't stop. Game is that good.
So finally nearly 600 hours in Civi V and finally I believe I can give it a fair review.

So lets get the obv out of the way is Civi V good ? Yes otherwise I wouldn´t have spent 600 hours in it and still booting it up now and then.

Civi V lacks nothing on graphics or gameplay, it is top of the line and there it is 100´s of mods for those who wishes to change their gameplay in anyway possible. 

Civi V is not as detailed or brutally hard as the former games in this installment, however that is a great thing in my eyes as it gets a lot of new players to test out the series that the rest of us have enjoyed for so many years.

The DLC`s Gods & Kings and Brave New World adds a lot of the things we are use to from ealier series and is diffenetly worth getting for anyone who likes the more complex version of the Civi series, that beeing said the other DLC`s is mainly just new maps or new nations to play with and really only something you should pickup if you are a huge fan or on sale.

So Civi is as it always have been, you start with a settler and one more unit and here you go form a nation that will stand the test of time. There is multiple ways to achive victory and it is important that you play to your nations strenghts and use your enemies weaknesses through the different time periods of our planet. This is classic Civi after all.

Tho do not let it fool you, Civi is a game that takes a long time often 6+ hours pr map and often one nation is just gonna hate you more than anyone else, in my case it was Poland wich wanted to nuke and kill me no matter what, they did a good job sometimes too.

All in all a great game and a great installment of the Civi series that brings a lot of new players and a lot of life into the series, so if you like complex games that takes time and patience then make sure you pick it up!

[h1][b]Bottom Line[/b][/h1]
9/10 Civilization V is another amazing game from a tried and true series of strategy board-game-esque video games, the expansions for the game add a lot of elements that should have been present to begin with but are very welcomed nonetheless. This is an amazing friday night game to play with your friends - you think Monopoly turns people evil? - just wait until your "friends" are stealing your territory and luxury resources and plotting paper-thin alliances; This is definitely a game most people would enjoy, I highly recommend!
[b] Purchase this game if: [/b]
+ Well-developed, immersive strategy games are your cup of tea
+ After 40+ hours, you want a game that you're still discovering new things in, refining your skills
+ Sometimes, you think about conquering the world with your rich Bollywood culture

[b] Don't purchase this game if: [/b]
+ Finals are literally looming over you because you will fail them, son
+ Really if you don't have the time or patience (no judgement) for a potentially longish game

One of my favorite games on earth. If you haven't got it, get it; if you already have it, continue loving it. (Huge, active modding community and grandose music are a plus, too.)

    [td]Visuals are simple but pleasing, good textures on the landscape tiles, nicely detailed units with lots of variety, good animations and an intuitive unobtrusive UI.  Zooming in and out on units, cities and terrain allows you see all the little  details while also giving you the ability to see the "big picture" strategic view. Graphics are vastly improved from previous games in the series. If I had one wish I guess it would be to have your cities and their buildings represented better visually. Cities grow and spread with population and advance with technology/era and have several different styles depending on the nation you select, and the building of wonders will add the wonder to the area surrounding your city but it would be great to have further customisation of your cities so you could really make them your own. The Civilopedia (like an in game wiki) is a little difficult to navigate and while informative could use some work.[/td]

    [td]Game Music is relaxing and fitting, from the dawn of civilisation, the age of exploration or the grand age of empire building it just seems to work well and I very rarely feel the need to turn down the music volume (as I do with other games). The ambient sound is excellent, move your screen to a coastal area and you will hear the wash of the sea, select your boats and you will here the crack of oars or ring of their bell. The little touches and details like these really make the game a joy to play.[/td]

    [td]Gameplay[/td]
    [td]9[/td]
    [td]Civilisation is a turn based 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game, a game of grand strategy & micromanagement, a game where the objective is to grown your civilisation and eventually conquer all through Technology, Culture, Diplomacy and Military might. This is by no means a simple game, it takes time to truly learn and fully appreciate but once you get into a game your hooked. Civilisation is by far the most addictive game (maybe with the exception of certain MMORGP's) out there. The "just one more turn" is a running joke because you will often find yourself planning on playing just one more turn to build something or win a battle and then you will look to the clock and find several hours have past. The start of the game is exciting, turns move quickly and you see your planning quickly realised, mid game you must continue your expansion and put in place what you will need to win. The only place where I feel this game falls down is late in the game, by this point sometimes there will be a clear winner, technology advancement will slow and your empire will often be so massive and units so numerous that just taking your turn can take quite a lot of time. Overall though gameplay is outstanding. The AI can be a little quirky at times but for the most part is challenging and tactically sound. Relationships between civilisations are all based on their predisposition and events which occur throughout the game and can therefore be somewhat predictable.[/td]

    [td]Story[/td]

    [td]The Story of history rewritten, the story of civilisation, so many details make up this game and so much background history on every aspect (via the civilopedia). The DLC add's on (amongst other things) quests which add to the story but in truth these add little to the game. The narrative is really what you make it, the interaction between the leaders of the other civilisations, all struggling for power, the alliances and conflicts mean there is very rarely a time of true peace or a dull moment.

  [tr]
    [td]Multiplayer[/td]
    [td]6[/td]
    [td]This is not an easy game to play multiplayer, the nature of the game means that you will all need a large amount of time to play a game through to completion, which may be problematic (especially with friends in different timezones or for people with connection issues). The most enjoyable aspect of multiplayer I found was the hotseat mode. In this mode you play locally and multiple players take the game in turns (like a boardgame), once again the time required to get near the end means you could be in for a very long (but very enjoyable) game.[/td]

    [td]While some purists will prefer the earlier Civ games in the series, I feel that Civ 5 (and especially with the main DLCs) is a worthy successor. It has the right level of difficulty and depth, much improved visuals and solid gameplay which will make you wonder where the hours went. [/td]

[b]First of all,[/b] you should definitely buy the [b]Complete Edition[/b] of Civilization V to fully enjoy the game!

The game has great graphics, many improvements compared to previous Civilization games, but unfortunately it lacks some stuff that I miss, like the [b]Palace[/b] and [b]Throne Room.[/b] Fortunately, they can be brought back via [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=108480475] [b]mods[/b] [/url] :D 

I have always loved Civilization V's motto: [b]"Wait! Just... one... more... turn..."[/b] and I can confirm you that it's true haha, I always play a few more turns after I beat the game :)

[b]All in all,[/b] it's an extraordinary game and I give it a solid 10 out of 10!

~ [b]"I found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble."[/b] - Augustus Caesar ~
[h1]Review of the COMPLETE version - Including all major expansions[/h1]

It's good; get it. On sale, it's a steal; get it!
With all the major expansions this is the essential Civilization game, and a great taster if you are thinking of Civ 6.

For those new to the game, the gist of it is this: You start off with just a city and a warrior unit from which you begin building at the 'dawn of time' and gradually expand your civilzation by gaining culture, advancing scientifically, building and using military, diplomacy, building new cities and buildings within those cities, and building enough 'improvements' to sustain an economy which can maintain the above. Because the map is tiled, each tile yields resources; perhaps a certain amount of food, construction, gold, or even another resource such as horses (needed to build horsemen etc) or iron, oil, even uranium (I don't need to tell you what that's for). As you progress you will find that you unlock more and more improvements, more buildings and more units that you can build, and if you play your diplomacy and development well enough, you will find that you can really start to get ahead of the competition; picture tanks versus musketmen - that can happen. Finally there are wonders which can provide a variety of benefits and a boost of culture. Benefits may include a free worker, reductions in costs for various things or even free technologies! Obviously getting a wonder before other people can therefore be of great importance. 

Those are the basics and to new-comers that's more than enough to be getting on with and the AI can give you fairly decent games on a variety of difficulty settings. Equally, there are many, many, many map varieties for your prefered experience - you might want a map with no water, on the other hand maybe small scattered islands: [u][b]You get a huge amount of customisation here, and it's not to be understated![/b][/u] On the subject of customisation; there are many, many different leaders you can play. The game even offers different leaders for a given civilization in some places; each leader provides differences to the civilization and so as you play with any given leader you want to keep their bonuses in mind and exploit them as best you can. It must be said though, personally I don't tend to notice a great difference between given leaders, the most noticeable thing is their unique units, but even those only last so long before technology supasses them. Maybe I'm just not pro enough. Yet, I play casually, and I enjoy it.

The visuals are readable and clear which really helps for longer play times, and the soundtrack is different for each Civ and varies based on the era you are in or whether you are at war or peace. As the Brits, you may even recongise a good bit of Greensleaves in there too. For new players there is also a decent [i]Civilopedia[/i], essentially a wiki lookup for everything in the game, and even includes larger written backgrounds on each leader and Civ for the historically curious. 

Personally, I never really player online or with other people much so I can't really comment on that, but from the time I did spend with other people, I can say that it's an enjoyable experience, even when they march into your territory and refuse all of your offers of peace because, well, they know they are going to walk all over you... or me in this case; we've already established I'm not particularly good at this game. 

Another caveat though is that the AI can be a bit temperamental, though this has always been an issue with Civ games and remains one because they can never really act like a human (then again I haven't played at higher difficulties); they might denounce you for no reason, expand erratically, and so on. The final thing to say is that late game diplomacy can be a little... 'off'? Things like World Congress and United Nations - too me they became annoying po-ups every few turns that had little to no impact on the game other than that annoyance and were never really very well explained as to how some people end up with more diplomats than others, more voters and so on. But by that time I have a big enough nuclear arsenal that no matter how much the UN may not like it, I can kill everyone everywhere, like Mr Kim over there only dreams he could.

In summary; it's a good game as a complete edition with all the expansions. On sale the bundle is more than worth it. Civ 5 Complete is a great entry into the 4X genre (4X = eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate). 
[u]Without the expansions though, Civ5 does have a few holes.[/u]
Civ 5 is like monopoly. You start playing it and it's great and before you know it 10 hours passed as you slip into a coma. You lost your consciousness long before that because you forgot to eat or drink. The last words anyone heard from your mouth were:

"Just... one... more... turn..."
I learned some great life lessons from this game that I can apply to my own life.

1. Don't trust Ghandi
2. Uranium = thermonuclear war between the Aztecs and Germany
3. Everyone wants your crabs
4. Don't be distracted by Catherine's rack when discussing war reperations
5. Stealth bombers = <3
Gotta love it when the last AI you never met turns out to be Ghandi, on his own continent, building all the good wonders, and shooting off nukes like a redneck with fireworks

11/10 for historical accuracy
AI declares war on me
[i]"You won't ever be able to bother me again"[/i]
Defeat AI, take their city
Every other civ declares war on me for warmongering
10/10
Playing Civilization V in a nutshell

> 3:00 PM: Okay, I only have two homework assignments I have to do tonight, a little Civilization V wouldn't hurt.
> 9:00 PM: Okay, okay it's getting late, but just one more turn..
> 2:00 AM: Just one more turn

11/10 this game gets you more hooked than a meth addiction
It's a trap.
You say one more turn then continue for a while, later you parents come by and ask why your awake you got work tomorrow and you say "one more turn then I'll go to bed" well we all know how that goes, so after a few hours you realize oh crap it's 1 A.M. but you look back at your screen and can't help but want to destroy Ghandi for nuking your island city so you continue and before you know it you have taken over the world in a sleep deprived state and finally achieve victory only to realize you need to be at work in 45 minutes...
Got bored at the airport at 1:30, decided to spend the 30 minute layover playing some Civ....... Next thing I know its 7:30, I missed my flight..... But I dont care, I stopped Ghandi.....
Be warned: playing this game will make all your friends hate you and you will never go outside again.

Don't try the multiplayer, you will become a genocidal maniac.

Also Gandhi is really violent.

9/10
I've been playing for 36 hours straight.  I don't remember if I've eaten.  May or may not have pooped myself.

But I'm taking that asshole Gandhi down before I get up from this chair again.

That's good, right?
I have lost almost every game I've played. I've been conquered, betrayed by allies, been beaten to space by one turn, been beaten to Wonder construction thousands of times. I have aged decades, and mourned my thoroughly sub-par gaming talents while Queen Elizabeth sinks my navy.

Thoroughly recommended.
The narcotic-grade addiction this game instills in a player should be regulated and could be weaponized.  Get your estate in order before you consider purchase.
Had nuclear war with Gandi lasting 400 years.
War ended. I fired 5 nukes, he fired 18. 
Only things remaining on Earth was fallout and the unscathed city of Delhi.

10/10 would nuke again.
I'm here to say I've had this game since it came out. I'm also here to say that in all and every circumstance you should get this over civilization VI. Don't @ me. Thank me later.
This review is mostly to counter those review bombing the game over 2K's awful new launcher, because:
The launcher and buggy gameplay are SOLELY a Windows problem.

If you play on Windows, please do boycott this game over its awful new launcher that may even have frickin malware in it.

Linux users and the very small number of mac users that can still play despite Apple deprecating OpenGL for no reason than "trollolololol" have no such launcher/bugginess issues.  Well, bugginess maybe, but nowhere near the current Windows version, and overall about the same as the bugginess has always been.

Do note that on Linux you may have to use a few launch options to get the damn game to work.  Once entered in however the game works fine.  The ones I use, which I cannot fully confirm are absolutely vital for the game to function or not, are as follows; feel free to tweak them if the locations of the .so files don't match your specific distribution, or it turns out one or more of the needed libraries are actually optional:
LD_PRELOAD='./libcxxrt.so:/usr/$LIB/libstdc++.so.6:/usr/lib32/libopenal.so.1' %command%

Besides technical gaffs lately, Civ V is probably the last really good Civ.  Past that, they decided that AI was pointless to develop and made the AI so dumb that I'm pretty sure a frickin' pigeon could outsmart it, which given some of the leaders in Civ VI seems VERY disrespectful.

With regards to Civ V's gameplay, one last thing I can say is that unlike every other 4X game I've ever played, Civ V's AI is actually reasonable to beat at lower difficulties.  They actually do diplomacy OK (Civ 4 was better, but Civ 5 at least had functional braincells in its AI's coding, unlike Beyond Earth or 6), and AI players never have that overwhelming feeling of "will kick your ass the moment you screw up" that's way too damn common in 4X games.  This does mean the game's very casual unless you pump up the difficulty to the highest setting, but sometimes casual makes for more fun Vs AI gameplay than the game being the Dark Souls of Grand Strategy. *glares at Age of Wonders 3, Galactic Civilizations 2, and many others*
If you're the type of guy that brings every tank at your disposal to a close ally's capital, ensuring him it's for his own safety after he told you he noticed them, and then bombing him to oblivion and seizing the city for yourself, then this is for you.
Truly a masterpiece: this game is an amazing deal for the price and has hundreds of hours of content within it. 

This is an iconic 4x strategy game and has a great wealth of content that will have you saying "just one more turn." When you tire of the base game, there are also countless brilliant mods that can entirely restructure the game. Do you wish you were playing HOI4 instead? There's a mod for that. Want to play a Game of Thrones campaign? There are about 5 mods for that. Do just want mods that add more to the base game than some DLC ? We have mods for that too. I cannot recommend this game enough, given its low price, and the hundreds of hours of great content it contains.

That being said, there are some weaknesses to this game. There are some bugs in multiplayer and the game will sometimes reload between turns and during late game, the micro can become boring for some, particularly worker management. Even with these downsides, I would still recommend this game to newcomers and experienced 4x players alike.
Let me start by saying I recommend this ONLY as a single player game. Multiplayer is, and has always been, complete trash. I want to know why turn-based games made in the late '90s have better connectivity than a game published in 2010. I have zero problem with any other multiplayer game. I'd really like to play this game with friends, and I sometimes do, but it's an exercise in frustration management. Games aren't supposed to be that way.

Other than that this game is fantastic. I thoroughly enjoy playing to the strengths of different civilizations to keep the game interesting. The plethora of options also help to keep it interesting, entertaining, and challenging.

Also, the EULA update destroyed your privacy. The launcher update was completely unnecessary and I don't appreciate the ads. They can update those but not the damned multiplayer connectivity.


One of best strategy games I have ever played. It's really worth the price, with all DLCs, game include a lot of options, maps and nations. The SI get a great built personality, It is not such fool as in "Civ. VI", we can obserw wise, inteligent actions. Good system of happiness, money and city-states create fine environment. Units, Wonders, Natural Wonders or Leaders, looks nice. Also lector and soundtrack creates have a large part. Another thing is access to the worksop with cool content. Potential hundreds of hours in one product, Recommended
This game is one of my favorites purely from the amount of variety is available to play. You can choose from an abundant amount of civs, and play however you wish to play. Overall great game.
An incredible alternate history strategy game, with hundreds (if not thousands) of hours of replayability. Factor in the scenarios and mods, and you could spend the rest of your life playing this without getting tired of it. 

Do you want to build up a vast trading empire with territories spanning the world, or a small country of super-cities? Maybe have a cold war for the dominance of the religion you founded? Or maybe just a cold war like the second half of the 20th century, with nations of opposing ideologies competing for control of the United Nations? Do you want to conquer the world? If so, when, starting from the beginning of history with warriors and archers, in the information era with stealth bombers and nuclear missiles, or anywhere in between? In separate eras of wartime, or one colossal world war? (I could go on and on. You get my point.)

There are a lot of aspects to the game, and it's easy to be overwhelmed initially, even with the fundamental rules. Once you get past the initial learning curve, though, and start to form an idea of what to do, the game becomes fantastic.

You should definitely get Gods & Kings and Brave New World. They improve the base game by a long shot and add several fun mechanics for additional dimensions of playing (notably religion and espionage in Gods & Kings, and tourism and ideology in Brave New World). The other DLCs are good too, of course, but the DLCs are high priority.
Almost 500 hours done and nearing completion of all the achievements, it's a wide game with different aspects and a lot to learn for beginners, but the learn is worth it. Lots of fun solo or with friends, it has challenging achievements to complete. Once you feel like you know a lot about the base game you should try to get some nice mods introducing things as many new Civilizations for example. Addicting... 'Just one more turn'
AS OF 2/2019: This game is still better than Civilization 6. At just under 500 hours, I can say that this is one of the most complete games to ever exist. You will fight to step away and spend your free time doing other things. The game plays fantastic without mods (vanilla), but the modding community has continued to shape this game into something even more amazing. This game is the gift that keeps on giving: a generally stress free experience that you can enjoy solo, co-op vs AI with friends, and of course in multiplayer. You can grab it for what amounts to theft during a Steam sale; it is worth every penny.
Civ 1 was my childhood - this game stands true to what I wanted it to be. No matter how much I tell myself I've played enough, I get sucked into another game and lose another 6 hours. Would recommend full-heartedly.
I was first exposed to the civilization games with Civilization Revolution for Xbox 360. The game was simple and broken in some respects, but it was still a great game. I decided to give a PC version a try shortly after I bought my computer. I bought the game for very cheap (around $12). I believe this came with both "God"s and Kings" and "Brave New World". I can gladly say that this purchase has been one of the best I've ever made. The memories and fun I've had are worth way more than $12. Hell, I would have paid full price if I knew what awaited me. Both DLC's add so much to the game and the replay value is massive. In my opinion it's the best civ out there even years after release. It might ruin some friendships if you play online or cause you to fail some tests after saying "Just one more turn". Still, nothing beats dominating someone militarily or economically or culturally or diplomatically or religiously or.....sorry. You get the point. I won't get into every detail of the game. I'm sure there's a YouTube review that can explain it all in 5 minutes better than I ever can. I'm just here to tell you that even as I finish my senior year in college, whenever I load up this game it takes me back to sophomore year of high school when I first saw that intro screen. Not just civ, but the first time I played Dota 2, Planetside, and even Red Orchestra 2. It takes me back to the summer nights of 2013 when these games kept me up all night. No worries, no stress, and no real responsibilities besides destroying mid tower or taking Delhi. I can go on all day about the memories I have of this game and all the others, but I won't bore you. The point I'm trying to make is this: If a game can take you back to a place when you were happiest; whether it be a month ago, or in my case 6 years ago, it's worth every penny. I hope you give it a shot and have the same experience I did. If not, I hope you find another game that gives you the same feeling. Just remember that it's never too late to start making memories.
I suppose I am only writing this review to counter the sheep bah bahhing over the launcher.

Windows users are so cute, they remind me of my little 3 year old nephew. 

The fact remains that if you use *windows* you are already tracked, logged, recorded, at the OS level. But hey - keep using the spyware of all spywares anyway... because it's become trendy to attack a game on it's privacy policy (even though they still use M$ which tracks at a much greater level than any game ever could) They post a bad review.

The game works flawlessly on Linux with no tracking, and without all the spyware ontop of the OS windoze users have... Highly recommended though it may be a bit simplistic for those coming from CK2.
This game opened my eyes to strategy beyond board games like chess and catan, and the similarity to these games is what sucked me in. After years of playing this through the generations of the game, thank you. 👏👏👏
B E S T game ever. Not only is it great for the family, but if you start.. you might end hours later. This game has given me the ability to say, "Just five more minutes."
Got to play as Hitler with the help of mods. Took over the majority of America and England.
Got nuked by Gandhi.
 10/10 would play another round of CivV with nuclear Gandhi
Don't buy this for the singleplayer unless you don't mind facing an AI that blatantly cheats all the time. As proof, I played a multiplayer game with my friends and we decided to play without one of them, replacing them with an AI temporarily. The AI quickly assembled a huge army, a ton of cities and generally it appeared as if the AI was being helpful. HOWEVER, when that friend came back online to play, they had ridiculously negative happiness and gold, resulting in their units being disbanded and rebellions breaking out everywhere. Essentially, the AI had ignored these central mechanics and despite being in a situation where a human player would get destroyed, they kept expanding their empire as if nothing was wrong. 

The game itself is really good, with tons of content, loads to do and really addictive gameplay, but the AI cheating basically ruins singleplayer for me. Luckily, with simultaneous turns enabled, the multiplayer can be really fun but the singleplayer experience is pretty awful.
What is there to say about Civ 5 that hasn't already been said? The game is a classic. Addictive "just one more turn" gameplay, civilizations each having a specific style of win con they excel at. Science might be a bit too good, and Poland is OP, but this is a great game for anyone who remotely likes 4x games
You shouldn't tolerate the new launcher.
This is setting a standard that flies in the face of a full release pay-to-play game, keep your adverts for f2play freemium titles or not at all.
I'll remove this review if they make any meaningful change to this situation.
To get rid of the new launcher see below:

*FIX*
For people who the new launcher doesn't work for, or who just don't want to have to load adverts every time they launch their game, you can revert the the old CIV 5 launcher using the following steps:

    Open up Steam and navigate to your LIBRARY.

    Right click on the game in your library and choose "Properties."

    Selected the "BETAS" tab.

    In the text box to "Enter beta access for to unlock private beta:" enter the password "ineedlegacyaccess".

    Click on the "CHECK CODE" button.

    You should see a confirmation message that access has been granted.

    If not already selected in the drop down, select "legacy" and click close.

    Steam may require you to download and update for the game. Wait for this to happen or force it using "LIBRARY -> DOWNLOADS".

    Once the game has been updated, click "PLAY" as usual and you will be running the legacy branch.

This game was in a perfectly fine place after being left alone for years as the developers worked on Civ VI. But as of the November 2018 update, the previously sleek and lightweight, and quick to load launcher has been replaced with a bloated piece of garbage that not only takes minutes to load, but is also riddled with overt, aggressive ads. Such things have no place being added into a game that received its last major expansion pack 5 years ago.

We've paid you money for this well-designed game already; is that not enough for you anymore?
Firaxis marketing VP: Ok, we released one DLC cycle for Civ 6 and now we are coming up with another, but Civ 6 still isn't as popular as Civ 5! Our fans are still mostly playing a game we haven't developed for five years. What do we do?

Fireaxis marketing team: Let's hire some contractor who never worked on the original title, develop a crappy, bloated launcher that has an ad feed, force everyone to download it, break crap that wasn't broken, and call it a day.

Firaxis marketing VP: Genius!
Now part of the spyware brigade.
First they added Redshell(a program collecting your personal data OUTSIDE of playing games, digital signatures as well as phone numbers, photos and adresses as well as geolocation, but due to community outrage, removed it and apologized.

What was their next step, after that disaster? Removing the part in the EULA, BUT instead linking to T2's privacy page (https://www.take2games.com/privacy/) with the distinct notion that you are bound by the terms of that agreement. And what do you find there? The very same thing they removed:

"The information we collect may include personal information such as your first and/or last name, e-mail address, phone number, photo, mailing address, geolocation, or payment information. In addition, we may collect your age, gender, date of birth, zip code, hardware configuration, console ID, software products played, survey data, purchases, IP address and the systems you have played on. We may combine the information with your personal information and across other computers or devices that you may use."

And to top it off, the local community moderator for CIV5 and CIV6 SamBC (who's doing it for free), is banning people who complain about how Fireaxis/2k/Take2 are handling the matter. They made one thread about the topic and said that they will delete any other thread on the matter or merge them into that thread. When me and another guy were having a conversation in said thread about how they have no intention to change it back, and made that containment thread so they can remove all other threads on the matter, we got promptly removed and subsequently banned by SamBC (who loves doing it for free.)

And they added a new launcher, with big advertisement of CIV6 for CIV5 fans who haven't bought it yet.  You can bypass it if you go to the beta access tab and enter "ineedlegacyaccess", but there's no saying how long this'll work. 
In the end, its now a spyware tool and its legitimately saddening. If you wanna play these games its probably a good idea to get different versions than the Steam ones.
I will renove this negative review at some point, because the game is pretty good.

However, I want to express my distaste about the advertisement in the new game launcher.
I feel like the new launcher focus is more on selling you Civ VI and its many DLC than starting Civ V. This really misses the point of a game launcher.
If I want to boot up Civ V, that is what I want to do and not see ads.
This game is definitely recommended in its 2017 state.
I am voting the game thumbs down due to Nov 2018 update to change the game launcher. It includes ads for Civ 6 and changes to graphics options. There are reports that the game isn't even loading for some.

We should be debating Valve's policy to requiring updates to games, especially ones that can be played without the internet.
And Valve's policy on refunds to games that no longer represent what was purchased.


Edit:
The launcher displays at the bottom "2K LAUNCHER BETA", which has been obvious from public reports and NOT what my money was exchanged for. At 3840x2160 I was able to select directx11 and load the game.
2k is reporting a workaround for directx graphic loading issues if you cannot:
https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/360012294374-Launcher-Blocking-DirectX-Options


I also setup windows firewall (adv settings) to BLOCK on both inbound and outbound:
\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\LaunchPad\LaunchPad.exe
\Steam\steamapps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\LaunchPad\QtWebEngineProcess.exe

I'm anoyed at Windows for allowing programs to add firewall rules, even when not admin.



https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/360011935293-Civilization-Launcher-FAQ
What is the launcher?
    Think of the launcher as a hub for all things Civilization. From it, you can launch the game, select the version of DirectX to use, and get the latest info from the newsfeed. The newsfeed contains content from the Civilization blog and YouTube channel.  

Can I disable the launcher?
    No. the new launcher cannot be disabled.
After 8 years they updated the game. Did they fix the numerour bugs they are aware of? No. They added ads to the game launcher so everytime you launch, you see an ad for Civ 6. Why you might ask? because Civ V is still more popular that Civ 6 (based on # of people in game). Pathetic.

Adding spyware and spyware permissions to the EULA should require an option for a refund. I already bought the game AND all the DLCs, why do you need to collect and sell my personal data too?

I love all the Civilization series, but this one has left a VERY sour taste in my mouth recently.
The launcher used to be a tiny, tight launcher, now it is changed into an AD factory.
I loaded Civ V to play Civ V... not be bombarded with ADS to buy Civ VI.
On top of that.... the launcher has 74 videos about Civ VI... and not one about Civ V.
The marketing team has really dropped the ball.
I would be careful supporting this company.

Aside from that, there is really NOTHING to complain about the team who programmed this awesome game. It has hours and hours of enjoyment.
So when you've had a huge backlash about your EULA update that takes pretty much anything they so wish from your PC...

You would think that 2K games would of learnt... but NOPE.. The toxic-ness has now spread to Civ 5..

ALL Civ games have now been deleted from my PC and they shall stay that way until the main PC mags/sites start to publish about what is going on and force a change...

NO ONE should have this right..

In a nutshell, the update installs files on to your PC to allow it to collect date.. A normal esq thing with some games.. but not these.. Not only E-mails, PW's, Usernames and the such... but access to pictures, files and folders, Usernames outside of Civ, Browser history, cookies and pretty much anything else they wish to take.. and if you say yes to this.. There isn't a dam thing you can do against them..

I loved Civ 5.. Civ 6 sucked from the start and never really got to the levels of 5.. 

It shall be missed :( #me2

I've had Civ5 for years and have hundreds of played time.

The game is 9/10, it's just not 10/10 because it has some glitches and doesn't support borderless windowed mode, I have to keep it with borders. It's by far the best Civ game IMO.

But then in late 2018 they updated the game, and it all went away. In forum there are tens of threads all talking about crashes, hundreds of ppl unable to play the game! It's 02/2019 and still no sign of solution.

Some update brought a new launcher. It's ugly and has no feature whatsoever. As the old launcher, which now they call legacy, it only serves to allow to choose Dx9 or Dx11 to run the game. It was added a "news" are that markets Civ6. But now the game is unplayable, because after loading the game it CTD!

This had never happened to me and I've never seen complains of crashes. The game is alrdy outdated but it worked. This update brought no new feature or content or fix, there was no beta prior to wide release, no warning. The new launcher doesn't even have a video options screen that would let us set it before launching the game! Even when using a trick to move back to the "legacy" launcher the game still crashes.

It's pretty clear they had sabotaged the game, to harass players who are still playing Civ5 instead of moving to Civ6. That's unacceptable! There are many games which come new versions and ppl still play old ones, name it Elder Scrolls, Fallout.

Civ is one of those, ppl still played Civ3 and Civ4 years after Civ5 was out. They can't break the game and make it unplayable almost 10 years after it was released! I haven't bought Civ6 yet, and for sure I won't buy it anymore.

If they rly wanted to enhance the old Civ5, they'd not have released a so bugged new version, just in holidays, much less let the game unplayable for all these months.
I absolutely love this game. It has near infinite replayability, a great sense of depth, and a wonderful community that had concocted a marvelous library of in-game mods. This game is a strategy gamer's dream, but I cannot recommend it for purchase at the moment. 

The reason is because Firaxis decided to update the platform with a new launcher, which is plastered with ads for Civ6. When I click "play" after choosing a sound option (usually DirectX 9 or 10), the intro video plays, followed by a load screen before the game crashes. Never before have I had this problem with Civ5, a game I have had and played for years. And apparently, I'm far from the only one having this same problem. 

For me, the "legacy" fix doesn't solve the problem, and if I am lucky I can get to the main menu of the game before it crashes again. Firaxis has essentially crippled an older product with a posterboard of ads for their newest one. Other than disincentivizing me to buy any of their products ever again (as they could just crippling older products to push their new ones indefinitely), it forces me to post my first negative review of a game. 

TLDR; The company used adverts for its new game to break this one. Great game but crippled by Firaxis' ad campaign.
Firaxis and it's new money grab spyware EULAs can go straight to hell.  Sorry to see such a great dev group go down because of this trash.   
Never buying a Firaxis title again, good riddance.
Congratulations on the new launcher and how it managed to turn a perfectly good running game into nothing more than a nice memory.
You people are aweful! For months now you haven't come up with a solution.
PEOPLE LIKE YOU SHOULD SIMPLY NOT LIVE!
The game is great, but the publishers/developers are taking the piss and effectively disowning the Civ V playerbase because their new letdown game was a flop that the majority of people disliked, and is horrifically overpriced.
Civ V is, and for the foreseeable future will continue to be, the sweetspot of the series. Don't buy it though, you could've got it for around $11 two years ago, now you have to pay around $42, around $8 of which is literally useless and you'll never play. It's all so they can influence buys on Civilization VI and it's $45 DLC instead.
[b]Loads of people have this game, ask a friend for library access or literally just pirate it.[/b]

The game is alright and similar to old Civ games, but what is really breaking this one for me is the fact that you can only have ONE military unit per tile. It makes warfare very very silly. Needless to say this is a completely hindering and unrealistic feature. Imagine you can have only one military unit in a square of the actual size of a small country. This is just a big fail and makes it unplayable for me without mods.

Then there is the DLC policy. They did not allow trade routes in the beginning if you didn`t have the DLC for it. Soon, it became obvious that this DLC is necessary for the whole game to work and they made it free. This shows just how greedy the devs are with bringing in actual necessary core content as DLC and charging customers for a partially working game.
This game is absolute garbage. I have sunken so many hours and wasted so much money on DLC only to constantly be bent over and fucked by the worst mechanics and AI in history. I have played Civilization since I can remember and never have I felt so cheated than I do playing this piece of trash. However If you are into BDSM, specifically CBT then by all means this is the game for you.
I really love(d) this game but as of right now it's 100% broken for me and many others. I bought this game years ago and I can't play it anymore, after an update that updated the launcher of the game. It's a real shame. And yes I've tried running legacy, verifying the game, reinstalling the game and steam, and all that. 

Don't buy this game. Chances are it won't even start. As of right now it's literally stealing your money.
played 200+ hours. most 4-5 yrs ago, some now in 2019. will uninstall for now. 

the game is playable, but far not as good as Civ4 especially with some mods (invictus, free btw). 
cannot understand if many things are bugs or features. 
I would not pay more than 20 euro for it. it still is like unfinished, beta, an MVP. and already so montezied (eg on additional nations, this must be a sin ). 

yeah, graphics are allright, but i care more for the gameplay and overall logic an balance.
WTF DEVS!!! This game was released nine years ago... Alt+Tab still breaks the game and forces the user to either restart their PC or use task manager to blinding close the game with just the keyboard. This is ridiculous. To top it the players get to see ads for CivVI. It truly makes me laugh that this game has a 95% rating, you guys do not deserve it.
Overrated game. The main feature that it lacks is the in-game worldbuilder that Civ 4 has. Civ 4 also has better music, more leader options per civ, better mods, and doesn't use the ridiculous looking hexagonal tiles. Buy Civ 4 instead.
Long & boring turn-based game. The "Overwhelmingly Positive" reviews astound me, a lot of people out there must truly be this dull. Oh, well?

Single player is OK I suppose. It gets very boring after a while but game play is much quicker than multiplayer. You might even be able to finish a game. I don't remember running into any bugs or crashes.

Multiplayer? Good luck finishing a match in one day, and then good luck saving it, and coming back to it a week later. It's also turn based, so if you're waiting on a friend's turn, and he decides he wants to take a crap, make a sandwich, talk on the phone, and play slip & slide with a banana peel then you have to wait.
Devs replaced the perfectly fine 8 year old game launcher with a new one that has somehow achieves to crash it constantly and thus completely breaks Civ V.
