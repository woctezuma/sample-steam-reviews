With having 139 hours with this game and playing for nearly a year I can honestly say that. This game is an amazing experience. It's such a joyride jam packed with. A lovable cast of characters, Multiple gamemodes, Dozens of amazingly well made maps to enjoy your zombie wacking slashing and shooting on, A mod workshop filled to the brim with modifications to enhance the games experience with new ones being added almost every day, Decently good looking graphics(especially for the time this game was made, even now they can be considered great looking), Online, p-to-p multiplayer, and single player greatness that you can enjoy either with new people, friends, or even by yourself! Even after how much it's aged it's community still holds strongly and is even still growing to this day. Truly a fun and memorable experience for many to enjoy.
No loot boxes, progress bar, or unlocks. Just straight up fun gameplay and reliable game mechanics.  Another classic must-have game from Valve. Yes people still play this game in 2017, it is still relevant and worth buying.
Some say this game is about killing zombies. Truthfully it's about protecting three idiots that do everything in their power to die and Shrek running at you screaming to get out of his swamp.
I used to play this game a lot back when it came out and Left 4 Dead 1 before that. It is one of the most enjoyable online games I have ever played.

What surprised me and why I am writing this non-review, is that you can find good lobbies and games as of november 2017.

Recommended with all my heart.
Yes, this game is good. It's worth buying. Yes, even after almost 7 years after the release people still play it even despite the fact it didn't really receive any new content. Why? Well, let me explain.

Is it good because of graphics? Totally not. Even for early 2010's graphics weren't anything that impressive. It's still almost the same Source engine which powered Half-Life 2 and episodes. Yes, it was constantly updated but it didn't really progress. I mean we still have the same concept from early 90's: a game server hosts a map and up to 16 or 32 (or even 64 in some modifications) players can join and move around the map. You can reach certain points of the map and it will load another map. And that's all about it. But it's not open-world in any sense. It's something that reminds me of Doom and Quake games. In fact Source was partially based on Quake engine after all.

But don't think graphics are bad. No, they are pretty enjoyable. I just don't recall technological advancement being a major selling point for this game. The game can impress you sometimes. Some textures look really dated. But overall it's just there. The game graphics won't make you scream in excitement, nor it will disappoint you even in 2016. A lot of stuff is destructible. I saw hours spent on zombie animations: infected puke, beat eachother, walk around, die spectacularly if killed. It's nice to see actual damage done to their zombies' bodies: some severe dismemberment and burning. But some may say graphics are kinda old. (Please don't think I'm one of these guys who only cares about polygons and realism, I'm just getting started.)

So maybe the story is the main element here? Nope, you can complete the entire game without even learning anything about the characters or what's actually going on. You and 3 other people are given a selection of weaponry, medical supplies, some other stuff. You have a very simple goal: get to your destination or do something. Just get out of there alive.

So why anything from 10 to 20 thousand people are playing this game right now? Why so many people played it for two or three thousand hours? Because of gameplay.

Words cannot describe how many different situations there are. There are only 10 or so types of enemies, 3 basic types of main weapons, a few different secondary weapons, grenades and other items. And that's it. I know it may sound a lot at first but very quickly you acquire a taste for a favorite combination of weapons and items.

Left 4 Dead series somehow manage to make people spend thousands of hours of their time playing the same set of maps. And it's a corridor shooter which means there is only one way to achieve your destination. How it's done then? Well, every time different items get generated in different places, you get zombies from different spawn points. You can play the same maps over and over, again and again. And people actually do.

Speaking of people, it's a multiplayer. Yes, there is single-player mode where you can complete campaign with bots. But the most fun is playing with people. I find PvE aspect extremely interesting. Keep in mind your enjoyment really depends on people you play with. This game is about cooperation, you will never be able to complete it alone. So you have to find a server with good players, maybe you should play with friends, maybe you should make friends with people who play properly. Playing with bunch of griefers will suck. Playing with someone who actually wants to play is the best thing since sliced bread. Holy crap, you have to help eachother. Someone shares a medkit with you. His medkit. A medkit is being spent to restore your health you wasted because you made bunch of mistakes. But someone helps you for some reason. And you help them back, sharing resources with them. Oh, and keep in mind there is no reward system for helping others.

There is PvP where you play as a bunch of zombies against a team of survivors controlled by other players. But I don't think it's as good as regular campaign. If someone thinks you are bad for the team, they just kick you out. Call me a weirdo, but I play it because of sense of fellowship or at least some basic positive human interaction. I don't really like the idea that someone may feel bad because I outsmarted them.

I think I finally cracked Valve's logic. The main thing about a videogame is gameplay. This is exactly why we have these debates “%gamename% isn't a real videogame!!11” and other stuff. It's gameplay first. Yes, you need amazing visuals to make a masterpiece but it isn't the main thing you should focus on. I heard about Crysis as a game with great graphics many years ago, finally I decided to give it a try. I was utterly bored after a couple of hours — its gameplay was dull. Yes, you need story and great sound effects. But they still are only an excuse for gameplay.

Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't fail to illustrate this concept. You can play it right away, you don't have to read wiki for 2 hours to craft a pickaxe or to build a basic rocket to orbit Kerbin. It takes minutes to learn basic concepts. “Easy to learn, difficult to master” — yes, we have it. But after a couple of hours I began to care about the story. You play as one of 4 characters, who are they? Turns out they are almost real people with some depth to them. Not too much, just enough to understand how they feel about each other. The whole story of zombie virus is told through surroundings. You see countless writings on the walls, a lot of documents are scattered around. The story told not using some boring and forced cutscenes but using details. You may skip story elements if you don't care about it. Or you may spend hours reading L4D wiki like I did.

Valve remembers that this is a game. If you look through L4D concept art, you will see that survivors were supposed to look a lot more different. They wore a lot more utilitarian gear. In the final game they are wearing casual clothing which helps to establish who they were before the outbreak. I mean look at Rochelle's ear rings. I know what zombies would tear away first. It's unrealistic, and is it bad? Nope, it's fine, it's a videogame, not a reflection of reality.

There is a lot of stuff in Left 4 Dead series which have never been done before. Developers added commentaries in game how they ended up creating everything, it's really interesting to check out. And I think I finally understand Valve's logic: they create games with some new elements. They create a game, it succeeds. Then they make a sequel which feels much better, they implement everything they need to make a great videogame experience. This is exactly what happened to Portal and Portal 2, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. This is exactly why Half-Life 3 may never happen: what exactly new can you say about first person shooter genre? It was told so many times, it's really hard to come up with something new. And this is exactly why they keep working on Left 4 Dead 3. At least it seems they are working on it. After all Left 4 Dead 2 appears to be incomplete to me. I feel like you can add more stuff in this concept.

But right now it's totally worth spending money on Left 4 Dead 2. It's a very addictive game, and most importantly people are still playing it. If you get bored, there are tons of content in Steam Workshop you can b-a-s-t-a-r-d-ize the game with (if in you are in that kind of stuff).
My favorite game, in large part because of everyone I got to play with... all of you. Thank you for making this game well worth playing.

I know you are all wonderful people. Be kind to one another.
Even though this game is over 9 years old it still holds up as being one of, if not THE best zombie game on the market. It's not only fun playing single player but it's hilarious when you can get three more friends to join in the zombie killing.

There's of course the standard Easy - Hard difficulities (Here being Easy, Medium, Advanced and Expert). So if you're looking for some mindless slaughtering to do you can put it on easy or if you and your friends is a tatical squad preparing for the zombie apacolypse this is a great way to start!

Also you don't have to play the first game to get into this one, all the maps and more from the first game is in this one. Even if you want to play oldschool there is a mode for that. Speaking of modes, there's Versus mode which is exactly what it sounds like, you control both the infected and the survivors in rounds. The one who ends the final map with the most points win. There is also a realism version of this mode which means the survivers can't see the green/orange/red glow around them as they used to.

There's also Survival which is aslo what it sounds like. Survive for X amount of time and you get bronze, silver or a gold medal depending on the requirments for the map you're playing.

Scavanger is the last major gamemode, here you play as survivor and infected and the objective is to fill a generator with gas. Who wins depends on which team's the fastest.

Then, finally, there's something called mutation. These are pretty much fun little mini modes. For example you have to try and survive an entire campaign on your own, you and all your teamates have katanas and can't get other weapons, you need to carry around a lawngnome to win etc.

Left 4 Dead 2 is a phenomenal experience and I highly encourage you to get it if you have even a modicum of interest in shooters. However, single player is difficult due to less-than-stellar AI, multiplayer even more so due to its less-than-stellar community. Your best bet is to find or bring three friends, and I'm sure you'll have a blast.

If you decide to fly solo and confront the community on your own, please complete the maps in single player, with friends, or on easy campaign online and learn their layouts before proceeding to Versus or higher difficulties. This will result in lower rates of vote kicking. But you will probably still be vote-kicked. Don't take it too personally.

Don't forget to check out the Workshop. Whether you like serious and well-crafted maps, or turning your game into an anime rendition of Ghostbusters, your experience will be 100% more enjoyable.

That's it. Respect the Director, read the tooltips, and keep moving. Have fun, kids.
I can't stress enough about how this game, right here, is argueably the best game you could ever get in the Steam store. Everything from the gameplay, co-op, mechanics, narrative, game modes, visuals, weapons, characters and the modding community are equally all fantastic and highly remarkable. It's one of those essential games every PC gamer must have in their Steam library. It's a massive step-up to the first game in the franchise and it would take a lot of hardwork and determination to make a sequel that could ever hope to topple this one.

I could write a much longer in-depth review about this brilliant game, but either you, the reader already acknowledge a lot about this game, through its strong magnitude and reputation. On the other hand, I personally would just want to leave it as the hidden gem, for the very small, minimal group of people who are still not familiar with this game, even to this day. With a message to those people, being simple and direct; you will not be disappointed by how much this game lives up to.

I would advice the newcomers to this game to take it slowly and definitely look out for the -75% off sales or even better, the free offer of this game which is most frequently appearing on big Steam sales. I hope this short and simple review will come in handy and have a happy halloween!
This game alone is the main reason i bought a pc to start off with, (Very Cliche, i know) with hundreds of hours on the xbox version of the game, i wanted to "upgrade" my left for dead experience, utilising the modding community and being able to finally play with my other friends on the pc and i honestly dont regret it, however there is one major drawback to the enjoyment of this game, the overwhelming amount of toxic players that are in the community. This can really ruin your game experience especially for unexperienced players as you will be kicked for almost any reason, half the time for no good reason at all. Examples could be:
- Missed the insta kill spot in versus? kicked! 
- Shot a teamate by accident because he ran infront of you? kicked!
- haven't already played over 500 hours of the game? kicked!
- your team leave you to die for no good reason? kicked!
- can't speak russian? kicked!
- use a health kit to save yourself on 3 health and not help your team mate who is on 43 health? kicked!
- get slowed down by common infected when the team rushes? kicked!
- do really well against the other team? the entire other team leaves, closing the server
- take the melee weapon that a 9 year old on your team wanted? kicked!
- the vote kick on you doesnt get accepted by the rest of the team? vote kicker leaves the game
this list could go on and on... oh and there is the guy that joins, kills the team, throws himself out of the window and then leaves i mean just **** those guys
(would just like to mention these are the examples that have all happened to me in the past two weeks of playing)

Despite this however the community does have some nice people in it, who just want to play the game and dont mind helping people or losing unfortunately these people arent extremely common so alot of the time your stuck with a toxic team that will kick you for just about any reason if your not perfect.

Other than the toxic players however, the game really doesn't have much i can fault it on
- There are 11 campaigns that are ready available without mods and campaigns aren't too long and remain pretty interesting throughout 
- a Fairly wide range of weapons with 14 guns, 11 melee weapons
- There are eight characters, four for each left for dead "game" each of them as interesting, funny and well developed as the next 
- there are 9 different types of infected (including special common infected under just common infected) with 7 of them playable in the verses gamemode
- the A.I director helps keep each level a little bit different, making replyability enjoyable
- bringing along friends is a great idea as it supports 4 player co-op and 4v4 player matches (there are servers that raise this cap, immensely)
- there are 70 available achievements that you can get so achievement hunting is a vaible playstyle

The modding community for this game is absolutely amazing with mods for just about anything with different weapons, and character skis, HD textures and lighting, new campaigns and gamemodes, different infected skins and sounds there is  a mod for the amount of cockroches that spawn on the ground (i have this, its called Roach Rules) i would list more mods but that list would take to long to type. There is also a lot of anime mods and bikini mods for the character zoey so if your into that, you'll like the modding community even more

Overall, despite the bad sportsmanship of some players, it really is an enjoyable game, with lots of replayability and things you can do to the game to make it diffferent, bringing along friends can make the game even better and if you dont have any (i know the feeling) chances are you can find some when you play.

Overall i'd give the game a 8/10
I have been playing Left 4 Dead since the original came out on Xbox 360 in 2008. Once I got a PC that could run Left 4 Dead 2, I discovered that Left 4 Dead really has no end of enjoyment. It is not for everyone of course, but if you like slaying zombies, exploration, teamwork, fun with friends, and some hilarious moments, this game is excellent.

It is now 2016, and still, people are making mods, addons, skins, new game modes, and creating unique servers that change the rules of the game. It is hard to get bored with a game that people keep adding to this much.

You will unfortunately hear about, or experience yourself, bad players on this game. This goes for EVERY game out there on the Internet. If there is a way to ruin other players' fun, there are people who will try to do it. Please don't blame the game for bad players. Left 4 Dead 2 still has hundreds, maybe thousands of players who love to have a good time and try to support eachother in game. I'm one of those. =D If you have a bad experience, try again please. More good-natured players are always welcome.

To me, this is the best game in the world right now. This is because it provides a fun way to meet cool and amazing people, who enjoy this great game where you are rewarded for working TOGETHER, instead of just killing eachother. The game itself provides lots of fun, but what really makes it amazing are the people you play with, and people who continue to make the game better.

I have put off writing a review to this game for so long, because I really can't say enough about it. This review seems like it barely scratches the surface to me. All I can say is try it. TRY IT. Join some games, download some add ons and try those. Remember not to take it too seriously. Get killed, laugh, try to get better, die more, laugh even more. XD Left 4 Dead forever haha.
Energizing versus mode(s,) breath (and life)-taking COOP experience; a world of add-on maps available, easy to mod.  I'll let my six thousand hours speak for themselves!  This is just one of those games you can't beat unless a fantastic sequel is made for it.  Here's to hoping!  Nobody does it better than Valve.  You get your money's worth with their games.  This one is no exception.  Even if you purchase L4D2 on sale, or if it ends up part of some bundle, you're still coming out ahead.  I challenge any new player to this game, or skeptic for that matter, to play out the first full campaign (all maps,) and then re-evaluate if your're still uninterested/skeptical.   

I'm confident you'll be happy you gave this game a chance;  some games are hyped and popular for a reason:  They're GREAT games! 

They could have taken my money, but all they got away with was my heart.   I paid 3 times more for games that I could never play a fraction as much as this.  I'll refrain from promoting a modded community I serve in, but let me say, to sum it up:   there is "An L4D2 Experience" for EVERYONE!  

Buy it.
You can play as Mario fighting Shrek with a giant diIdo while your teammates Batman, a Raptor and Megan Fox are busy killing Teletubbies and Osama Bin Ladden with gingerbread while listening to Benny Hill as a boss fight music.

Thank you Steam Workshop.

10/10

The successor to Left 4 Dead, this second game adds new maps, new weapons, new special infected with new attacks and even new characters. But in many ways the most important different between the two games is the scoring system.

Without mods, the first games scoring system really did tend to induce rage. A single mistake on a map and you could lose so many points that teams would be totally demoralized and either fall apart (making the game effectively over) or just quit (making it absolutely over). For hardcore players this was half the fun, but for the average casual player it could make Left 4 Dead a little too frustrating.

Left 4 Dead 2 on the other hand had a far more forgiving score system allowing teams who fail badly on map 1 to still feel they have a good chance of clawing the in back in the next 3 or 4 maps. With party wipes being a little less likely due to the removal of the quad cap, Left 4 Dead 2 is still a game people can play causally and still enjoy. With the extra variety of a lot more special infected meaning a lot more variety in possible tactics, Left 4 Dead 2 is still one of the best team focused games that I have ever played.

If you have a small group of close friends who love winning through superior team work rather than superior twitch skills, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best PvP games you could try. But be warned, playing with random people you have never met can be rewarding, but more often than not it can be bloody annoying.

HOURS ON RECORD : I don't play this game on my public account. I have over 1500 my private account.
Exactly I would recommend this because it's a great co-op game maybe also multiplayer. This game is not complicated. Even this game is not horror but it's good to play with you play with your friends, this game you will found out about teamworks between you with your friends. Also it's so fun when you make a little troll on your friend in-game during walking the path. Moreover you will feel the good and enjoy when you had finished the mission with your friends, taste the sweet, sour even bitter together. This game brought me into my childhood to when I used to be play with my friend everydays after school no matter what is the weather. This game will not make you feel boring when you play with friend. So I more recommended play this game if you have friends to play with you. Then you can enjoy the game so much.
As you can see from my hours played.  This is one of my favorite games of all time.  The real reason people have put so many hours into this game is because you are able to mod the crap out it and I joined a group of servers years ago and played ever since.  Not playing much now because not many people play this game anymore but was the best zombie game for it's time.
Everyone ever should own this game.

+Killing zombies
+Good survivers
+Melee weapons look awesome
+So many god damn mods that you just want to install them all and kill your computer, but it would be worth it because it would look fucking amazingggggg.
+Ingame voice and chat, so friends all around!

-You will spend most of your life on this game.
-You may become emotionally attatched to Ellis. No? Just me? Ok.
Dear Humans. This is Tank. You probably know me from hit game Left 4 Dead. Well, Tank need to get something off chest. It make Tank sad that as soon as you see him, you start shooting at him. Tank not mindless killing machine. Sure, Tank enjoy smashing human skulls to paste. What 12-foot tall, 800 pound, horribly mutated creature wouldn't? But there is another side to Tank. Tank also enjoy stamp collecting, scrapbooking, and updating blog under pen name "Love Muffin". Tank took origami class once at adult-learning annex, but fingers to big, so Tank smash teacher. Got B-minus. So, when you see Tank on the streets of city, instead of shooting, try asking Tank how day is going. You may find that you and Tank have more in common than you think. Of course, Tank will still smash you, but you will die having made new friend. And that make Tank happy.
Left 4 Dead 2 is my very first game on Steam. Left 4 Dead 2 is like first love. As they say, "first love never dies". No matter how many years have passed, this game will always be in your thoughts and you'll want to come back to this game. If you haven't played it much, you'll miss it. I've played this game for 2 years now and yet each and every experience I have on this game is unique and fun. Timeless classic.
This game has genuinely changed my life for the better, I was in a really dark place after I got addicted to fortnite, after 5 battle passes I finally decided enough was enough and I headed to the steam store. And to my delight I saw the Valve bundle for only 10 dollars ridiculous I thought but then I saw it contained the left for dead sequel left4dead2 and I was intrigued. I joined versus mode with some friends and they really bent me over for a few. I practiced the next night and oh boy did I show them this game is really a breath of fresh air and I cant do anything but recommend it.
This game is almost 10 years old now, but it is still alive and doesn't feel aged at all. The graphics are still great even when compared with today's standard. The hardware requirement is pretty low, any PC that aren't too ancient will be able to run this game pretty well, even for laptops that runs on integrated graphics.

The controls are smooth, bugs are almost non-existent. Official contents already have a lot of replayability, and on top of that the modding community is very active, adding tons of contents with mods for new maps, new game modes, and many funny cosmetic changes.

[h1]Fast paced action game[/h1]

Although the setting is in a zombie-apocalypse world, the game isn't like a horror survival game. This game is more like a fast-paced first-person shooter focusing on getting from point A to point B, mass-killing zombies and completing objectives. The graphics are very violent and gruesome, and there may be some jump scares when you first encounter some of those special zombies. However after playing for some time, you will get used to the violent graphics, and learn to pick up sound cues to be prepared for the jump scare. This game is a pretty good game for gamers who wanted to enjoy the zombie-apocalypse subgenre but too afraid to play other horror-focused survival games.

[h1]Co-op gameplay and community[/h1]

This game heavily emphasizes on co-op gameplay, and so it is best played with friends with voice chat on. Although you can still play it in single player (where the rest of the team will be controlled by AI), the AI is almost as good as a novice player in terms of action judgement and reaction time. You will need better real players in order to win harder difficulties.

Even in versus mode, the game also encourages co-op gameplay, where the team with better teamwork and co-ordination will win the round.

The game community is mixed. When you're lucky, you get a great team and enjoy the game very much. But sometimes you get trolls that joins in and then kills your whole team to ruin the game. That's why it is best played with friends, or make friends with people you enjoyed playing together with in those great public games.

[h1]For achievement hunter[/h1]

This game have a healthy balance of different types of achievements. You get some just by playing the game normally. Some of them require some skills, some of them requires some luck, and some of them requires you to setup the game scenario together with your team.

Although the game community isn't dead yet, it isn't as active anymore. Some of online-achievements requires a lot of luck when finding for public servers to play on, especially multiplayer achievements that involve a specific game mode or map. These are easier done with boosting.

Also, there are a few very difficult ones that you will need to have a team of dedicated players working together to win (eg: Complete a stage in expert realism mode).

So if you are a completionist who wants to 100% this game, it will take quite a while and quite a lot of effort.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

My score: 9.5/10 (Get it with your friends, and play together!)
I modded this game and now I don't know what it's about; something to do with a virus and shrek running at you shouting DONKEY.

I think I remember the original game being good...
Want to be a survivor? FINE
Want to be a zombie? FINE
Want to be a tank? FINE
Want to scream like a girl when tank is coming? FINE
Want to step silently near a witch? FINE
Want to play co-op with your friends one on the best zombie games? FINE
Want to kill your friends in versus mode? FINE
Want to be a schoolgirl, Deadpool or Lara Croft (using workshop mods only) in a multiplayer game? FINE

oh... you have Left 4 Dead 2 already? FINE 10/10.
Left 4 Dead was fun but with Left 4 Dead 2 it gets exciting new content across the board and plenty of it, Left 4 Dead 2 outdoes its predecessor and makes the zombie apocalypse an absolute blast.
Even though this game has a highly toxic community it still remains one of my favorite games of all times. The game started pretty tough for my three friends and me on normal difficulty (campaign mode) and we wondered how you could ever beat it on advanced or even expert? The level of helplessness and panic was just incredible. By now, after more than 1000 hours ingame, I know the game pretty good and I know that this game has for sure a nice learning curve. After some games the panic starts to turn into understanding and later on into a level of serenity, that turns this game into quite  another game.

For me the toxicity is actually kind of fun in an online campaign game - I try to take it as a challenge. Am I able to win this campaign with such a team?
With all the toxicity going on, the rare occasions of finding nice and skilled players online is pretty awesome.
Once in a while you find this one game, where four random people just stomp the game into the ground: 
One for all and all for one - no one is left 4 dead!
Being a veteran of L4D2 on the Xbox, I made the jump to PC for the sake of the Steam Workshop. After making the Tank into a giant Shrek, I can say the purchase was justified.
Left 4 Dead 2 is considered to be one of the best co-op games!

Left 4 Dead 3, Make it happen Valve! The last game came out in 2009, Since then i've been hoping that maybe one day a 3rd game would be released. I guess this series is dead just like Half Life...
[h1] Let’s review : Left 4 Dead 2	[/h1] 

This game is the hallmark of terror and Co-op first person shooter. Join a gang of four and thread thru several maps littered with many types of zombies. You'll run, shoot, run again, revive a team member that is in trouble, and run again. 

[h1] Pros:	[/h1] 

- This game succeeds in creating the horror setting, and the music its accompanies you while you travel, giving at times hints of when its about to get serious.
- Many types of gun and zombies. And you must choose your weapon to fit your style,from submachine guns, to assault rifles or if you need more kick a grenade launcher for full effect. Get your hands on an axe and plow away or pump that shotgun and kill the horde in a few shots.
- While you can play alone, its much better playing with someone, has you can never guess the way the game is going.
- The storyline takes you thru a number of settings spread over 6 campaigns, but with more available for downloading, expanding the lifetime of this game, and they tell a above average story, where the main goal is ESCAPE.
- The multiplayer aspect of it is great, plenty of servers and players, and you can even play for the other side - The Zombies, and make use of the special powers of each one to kill your prey.
- Imagine a huge hulking monsters appearing and you are inside an hotel complex, not much space to run, so you'll have to fight and survive to the next stage.
- One of the strongest points in this game, is that at points, you can hear an audio cue, and you know you are going to get a overwhelming impact from the coming Horde, where you will have to fight tooth and nail for your life  

[h1] Cons:	[/h1]

- You can play alone, but the bots wont be much of help!
- Even on Hard, with the right players you wont have much trouble getting thru.  

[h1] Final Review	[/h1] 

Join your friends or complete strangers in this horror-action game, you wont regret it, kill hordes of zombies and monsters, or join them and stalk your prey. I give this game a 8 out 10 in my book. Its worth the money, and you'll have fun for hours.

Enjoy Guys and Girls, and if this review helped you in any way please leave me a Thumbs up, i would appreciate it immensely.

Obviously a great game, but if you play online against randoms prepared to get kicked for even the slightest mistake. 

Weird since when I used to play online on the 360, across hundreds of matches I only got kicked a couple of times. 

Buy the PC version for the mods, play with friends and stay away from random games. That's my advice.

Game on, everyone! To keep this brief, here's Left 4 Dead 2 in a nutshell:

PROS
• This is hands down THE BEST zombie-themed game out there, aside from the Resident Evil series of course.
• The multiplayer Versus mode has one of the most balanced gameplay in FPS games, in my opinion. Both Survivors and Infected get a fair shot at trying to wreck each other.
• Ridiculous replay value.
• Gaben seems to love me enough (a Tank gets spawned in a level like 90% of the time I wish for one) to grant my requests.
• Still holds up fairly well in 2017 despite being a 2009 game.
• Rewards skilled/veteran players and gives newbies a fairly easy learning curve compared to many other games out there.
• Endless mods/maps to play with.

CONS
• Too addictive.
• Everyone's waiting for bloody Left 4 Dead 3 to come out.

As a final note, this is well-worth your money even if it isn't on sale, so get the game already and hop on the zombie-slaying action!
A review to answer your questions

Is this game dead?
Hell no it isn't, there is still players playing it to this day 2018

Is it fun?
Hell yes it is, one of the best coop zombies games in videogame history.

What audience is this game designed for?
For all audiences: to professionals to novices

What is this game about?
4 survivors vs a endless horde of zombies, with the objective to work together to survive to the end.

What mode would you recommend?
For new players normal campaigns would be highly recommended, just click on quickplay and learn through experience

There is mods in this game?
Hell yes, this game has been out so long that many people created a long list of options you can choose to upgrade in the workshop.

Is 20$ worth it?
Hell yes, worth your money and this would take a long time before you get bored. Even if you did get bored, this game will still comeback to you.

Pc Requirments?
This game can run on my craptop well on low settings with 30fps with no mods on, however i recommend a computer than run your standard computer games on medium settings to have all the mods you please.

Any warnings?
Don't play versus unless you can prepare for any flaming thrown at you, in human vs human modes toxicity stirs in these places. In higher difficulties where friendly fire does serious damage, be aware there is significant amount of trolls who enjoy angering people by throwing fire and shooting others, so be cautious.

Overall?
Fun game, MOSTLY nice people who would help you when you play through the game. A game that would help relive some stress and pass some time.
Good game if you look at all the special zombies as different kinds of drunk people.

Smoker: The chain smoker
Boomer: The puker 
Witch: The emotional mess
Hunter: The too drunk to walk kind of person
Spitter: The person who spits after taking a shot
Charger: The drunk who bumps into everyone
Tank: Drunk broseph who also has a steroid addiction
Would recommend it to anyone looking to play a zombie game.

It is one of the best surviving zombie co-op games available on steam.

Also comes with a large pool of mods under the steam community workshop to make it even more interesting.
Timeless classic. Genre of its own. Great with friends. Industry standard for co-op zombie games. Great for casuals and competitive. Can easily pop in and spend hours playing. Killing zombies never felt more satifying.
[h1]Left 4 Dead 2[/h1]

This game is a well-known classic. Anyone that has played it could tell you about all of the precious, hilarious, and unforgettable memories that the game has given them.

If you're deciding on whether or not to buy this game, the answer is quite obvious. Go for it! My only regret is not picking this game up sooner.

Worried about the slightly dated graphics? (Don't even look that bad imo) There's retextured pack mods for that!
Want new opportunitues for custom maps and skins for characters / weapons? There's mods for that!
Want to play a game with a very large and lively playerbase? Left 4 Dead 2 is just for you. 

If you've ever played Dying Light, and loved the multiplayer as I did, then you'll adore this game. The only thing it's missing is the parkour and different models and all, but it's great. I'm really enjoying this game and I can't wait for all the new memories I'm going to make. I'm sure I'll be looking back at this review months, even years from now and remembering them all. 

All in all, if you want to try a fun game out, then give this a chance. It may seem a little hard to grasp at first since there aren't really any tutorials, but you'll get it. 

I r8 8/8
*Final horde comes*
"GRABBING A SHOT!!!!"
Uses said shot, plows though the whole horde, makes it to the safehouse.
Left my teammates to deal with Diddy Kong, Snoop Dogg, Shrek, Wario, and the chocolate guy from Spongebob.

10/10 would leave for dead again
Step one: Start the game
Step two: Join a Realism Versus game
Step three: Wait for a pro player with 4000+ gameplay hours to tell you to go back playing the campain
Step four: Get kicked
Step five: repeat until you're the guy with 4000+ hours
Unlike most other zombie games, one of the biggest focuses here is teamwork. This sequel greatly improves upon the already popular original despite only being released a year later than it. There are many modes available, from single player to co-op to versus to survival; there are even a lot of "Mutations", modes that have unique rules and restrictions. The characters are also pretty funny and each have a primary trait, such as Nick being a serious pessimist and Ellis being a naive optimist. Playing on a controller or keyboard shouldn't matter either way as the aiming and controls are smooth- possibly even better than some of today's releases. What makes things even better is that there are a ton of mods on its Steam Workshop, so you can turn the survivors into other pop culture characters, make the Infected bizarre creatures, or give your weapons pretty colors. The main concern is that the AI can sometimes suck, especially on single player mode. Apart from that, this is one of the best zombie games on the Steam store.
Left 4 Dead 2 is a hard game to review. The left 4 dead games "both of them" are games that are unlike anything else I have ever played, they are games that quite literally changed my entire life. These games are the types of games that you can meet people on that will be friends for years to come and these games also have an unreal amount of replay value. you have campaign for the casual players with addon support so you have an almost endless amount of maps to play if you dont mind downloading more, you have versus which can be really fun, but sadly in both games unless you play with friends the community is either tryhards that care too much about winning or people that are so terrible that you wonder how they even got their computer running in the first place. Lastly there is survival, my personal favorite game mode. People in the survival community "once you actually find the real survival players" are useually a nice bunch of people and its a game mode unlike the other two in a good way once you give it a chance. Honestly both of these games although they both are titled "Left 4 Dead" are very different and many people i have run into tend to think of one game as simply better than the other, but objectively speaking this is simply not the case. Both games are too different to really make that kind of judgement. Both of these games are games that if you enjoy this type of gameplay, then you could waste thousands of hours on them.

But this brings up the biggest problem with these games, the people in them. Do enough searching and you will find people you can mingle with but the majority of public players in either game regardless of game mode are unbelieveably dumb. In vs also not just the really dumb people but you have the typical assholes found in any game based around pvp that seem to think that winning makes them more important somehow as a person and don't seem to realize that there is no reward for winning in a l4d games like there is in a competitive game like counter strike or dota with their tournaments. 

Campaign is a really casual game mode compared to the other two but still there tends to be assholes in this game mode too sometimes, people that find joy in joining pub games just to grief their teammates for some reason and then leave without a word. Thankfully this is rare and most people in campaign are either mute or friendly.

Then there is survival, a game mode that brings me more enjoyment but also more frustration than any other mode. In L4D2 it seems to be a collection of people that for some stupid reason refuse to play anything except for the mall map, people that are actually really terrible at it too and can run laps for 100+ min on mall sure but could not get a gold on any other map to save their life. There is l4d1 survival as well which is a dif style of play but the community is dying off because all of the players who have been around a long time have gotten tired of the game and pubs are beyond stupid. Always either people trying to glitch a time or people so bad/dumb you wonder if they were dropped on their head as a baby 5 times.

All in all, You will enjoy the l4d games, both of them if you enjoy co-op based shooters, but you will have to endure a very mixed crowd of people regardless of game, with the first game haveing a somewhat more friendly crowd cause of the smaller community. I would recommend both games if you have the patience to search for people worth talking to or have someone to go into the game with.
[quote][h1][b]TL;DR[/b][/h1]
With a personal rating of "A++", [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] is considered to be a classic FPS game, the second part of the series that teaches us how teamwork properly works in a world full of zombies.

[h1]Summary[/h1]
Following the tracks of its precedessor, [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] takes place in the zombie-infested U.S.A., where a new traveling 4-membered group of Survivors fights for survival. Having in their disposal a vast arsenal of weaponry, the player faces the endless hordes of Infected, exploring several locations, completing objectives and trying to find a way-out.

[td]9 ⁄ 15[/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Universe: Great[/th]
[td]🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Mostly set in fictional areas, suggestively located in the post-apocalyptic, zombie-infested U.S.A., [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] features a great variation of beautiful locations, including a hotel, a mall, an amusement park, a stadium, highways, swamps and isolated villages, a mansion, a sugarcane mill, a gas station, cities and more.[/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Characters: Not OK[/th]
[td]🔴🔴⭕⭕⭕[/td][/tr]
[tr][td][i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] introduces a new cast of Survivors, including Nick, Rochelle, Coach and Ellis, sticking to the series theme number, as well as the gender ratio of its predecessor. Unfortunately, apart from the adventurous stories that are hillariously narrated by Ellis, there is nothing else worth mentioning about the whole group, as the Survivors are overly restrained by their repetitive voice commands. Unlike [i]Left 4 Dead[/i] which manages to balance this flaw by additionally realeasing an online [url=http://www.l4d.com/comic/]comic[/url] with intriguing new info about its characters, [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] fails to attract the audience's attention towards the new Survivors. Thus, they are bound to seem indifferently mysterious, if not completely impersonal and boring.[/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Plot: Not OK[/th]
[td]🔴🔴⭕⭕⭕[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Along with its predecessor, [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] follows the same basic, trite concept: a small group of random Survivors who share no history fight for survival in a world world full of zombie-like beings, known as the Infected. A classic scenario ends up being completely vapid and unchallenging, as the linear levels and the simplified objectives both add up nothing of interest to the game's plot and also restrict the player's contribution to just killing zombies, activating generators and other machinery and calling for help.[/td][/tr]
[tr][th][h1]Artistic work[/h1][/th]
[td]20 ⁄ 20[/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Graphics / Visuals: Great[/th]
[td]🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]For sure the graphic quality of [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] is beyond satisfying, as far as the standards of its year of realease are concerned. The areas, the characters, the objects, all of them seem detailed and realistic, while the bloodbath that follows the Survivors' encounters with the Infected is always full of gore.[/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Cinematics: Great[/th]
[td]🔴🔴🔴[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]The introduction video is very good.[/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Soundtrack: ⭐ Epic[/th]
[td]🔴🔴🔴🔴🔴[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]It is well-known that [i]Valve[/i] is used to providing its audience with high-quality game soundtracks and of course [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] is no exception; on the contrary, music is a big part of the game's experience, as it stimulates the desired emotions by creating an atmosphere full of suspense and agony. Notably, each Campaign is accompanied by its very own theme soundtrack, which is basically an adapted (to-the-style-of-each-Campaign) version of the original soundtrack. Also, [i]Midnight Riders[/i] are here! A single exclamatory mark cannot compress the awesomeness of this hard rock band, created by [i]Valve[/i] for the purposes of the series; a famous group that is widely-advertised in the whole game and whose songs are playable in the in-game jukeboxes; they even have their own albums, concerts, merchandise and [url=http://www.midnight-riders.com/]website[/url].[/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Audio: Great[/th]
[td]🔴🔴🔴🔴[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Going on, when it comes to in-game audio and sound effects [i]Valve[/i] proves to be, once again, an expert creator, capable of stimulating the player's hearing, enhancing the whole experience acoustically.[/td][/tr]
[tr][th]Voice acting: ⭐ Exceptional[/th]
[td]🔴🔴🔴[/td][/tr]
[tr][td]Keeping in mind the very few human characters encountered in the game, one can mainly focus on the 4 main Survivors, whose voice acting is professionally good.

[h1]TL:DR[/h1]
[i][b]THE[/b] zombie game your friends are talking about.[/i]

[h1]The Good Stuff[/h1]
++One of the best zombie games out there
+The steam workshop support for this game is insane, you can literally find anything in there made by some crazy people
+Online multiplayer is still thriving to this day after 8 years
+A.I. Director 2.0 does a great job with the coordination of the zombies
+Play as the survivor, OR play as the infected and destroy your friends
+Replay value is very high, even considering the repetitiveness 
+Steam achievements provide some extra challenges for you
+Controller and mouse & keyboard friendly, allows some good co-op action

[h1]The Ok Stuff[/h1]
=However, the A.I. Director 2.0 does sometimes act stupid for your survivor allies
=Hitboxes for survivors are a little weird for some infected characters. The Jockey has a tough time latching on to characters at times, as does the Charger less frequently
=Story is meh at best, not the game's high point but enough to add some beef to the game

[h1]The Bad Stuff[/h1]
-Reptitive gameplay no matter what mode you play. Shoot zombies, move on to the next area, shoot zombies, move on to anotha area

https://youtu.be/zi7ofmYUWfI
Ruined my gaming life and at the same time it really enhanced it. I met most people on my friends list on it and became really good friends with some of them.

I'm mostly a Scavenge and Survival player. Yeah, I don't really like Versus and Campaign, which are the most played game modes. Being a Scavenge player, where the community is way smaller, I get to know basically everyone who plays it regularly and when I join a game (mostly on the Rooftop map) it's guaranteed that I will meet someone there who is either on my friends list or that I knew before just by playing. I'd say the best years to play this game mode where 2010-2013, it just died from there on to nowadays, but surprisingly, there's people who still play Scavenge, so there's always at least 1 game.

Left 4 Dead 2's main problem, unlike most FPS games, isn't hackers. It's the community itself, specially the tryhards. Those morons that take video gaming more seriously than real life (well, they probably don't have a proper life to begin with anyway). Yeah, they get mad in [i]public[/i] matches if people don't have over 2.000 hours and don't skeet every Hunter they see, even if their team is winning. You're going to have a hard time playing the PvP gamemodes, Scavenge and Versus, if you don't have at least 200 or 300 hours on Campaign and Survival you're going to be judged (if your profile isn't set to private or friends-only).

Don't expect a horror shooting game, there's no horror elements in Left 4 Dead 2. The creepiest thing (if you can call it that) is the Witch, and even so, she's kinda... cute. Expect an action game with a toxic PvP community and a (mostly) friendly PvE one.
This game is just.. amazing... 
Since the time it was released, until now 2017. 
This game is till so fun!
I have to say, Valve and PowerSource, as well as Steam, made one of the best games on the district. 
A Fantastic game to play with your friends and with strangers!
Over 2000 hours and I still haven't reviewed this game! well here goes...

Do you like zombies? Do you like guns? Do you like Mariocart? Do you like to spam right-click like your middle finger has Parkinsons? Well you are going to love this!

L4D2 is a unique, fast paced twitch shooter with loads of replayability. Even if you get bored of the official valve content there are tons of fun community maps to try out. In particular I recommend Questionable Ethics and The Bloody Moors. Despite the zombie theme L4D2 is not really a horror game and the L4D2 campaign and characters in particular are pretty cartoonish compared to the darker design of the original Left 4 Dead. However, all of the L4D1 maps were ported over to L4D2 a long time ago now, so there isn't much need to buy the original unless you are really curious or nostalgic about it.

The game is getting a bit old now with alot less people online than there used to be. Consequently mosty of the players you find online are either veterans/long term addicts of the game or newbies from the previous sale. This only really applies to the PvP modes of the game (Versus and Scavenge) but new players are going to have a tough time in public games because of this. L4D2 does not have a very high skill ceiling like Counter Strike or Quake but there is still a fairly steep learning curve to start with. In any random public game you are likely to be playing with players who have 1000+ hours who know the maps like the back of their hand and know all the various little tricks and strats. You will find them frustrating to play against and they will find it frustrating having you on their team. This is the kind of game where one player can really drag a whole team down so if you are that player you can expect to be kicked alot. If you are new you should start out playing versus with friends, or get onto some 10v10 commuinity servers where you can mess around without getting kicked from the game.

People say that the public versus community is really terrible but I dont think it is any worse than other PvP games apart from the fact that some of the game mechanics specific to L4D2 make people rage such as the forced dependence on teammates and some of the inherent randomness of the game. In fact I would say that the versus community is better now that it was 4 years ago when the game was more popular. For example most of the time now people will 'ready up' before starting a round, whereas before it was normal to see people deliberately rushing out of spawn while players are still loading in. But yeah... if you are new you are going to need thick skin in public versus.

Versus is definately the most replayable mode, and the reason why many people keep playing this game for thousands of hours, but it what I said above puts you off you can always stick to playing the co-operative modes which are slower paced and with more easygoing players. The exception to this is expert difficulty, where friendly fire damage is signifigant and effects playstyle alot. Because of friendly fire expert is also the biggest target for griefers. Playing alot of expert co-op will make you paranoid about teamkillers and you will start to accumulate a nice big blocklist.

Anyway what I have written might come across as negative but I think it is honest view based on over 2000 hours of gameplay which by itself says alot about addictive and replayable this game is. I don't think I have ever played any other game for as many hours, and no other game has made me laugh or rage as much as L4D2.
It's zombies vs humans so brace yourself! And what makes this game a one of a kind? Besides there are several titles in the same genre with similar elements. Let me first point out the 'good' in the game. Valve indeed outdid themselves with a variety of special infected each with unique ability and style. The common infected rush in hordes and are super fast on feet. It's thrilling!

All maps, single or multiplayer are campaign styled which means they are huge and you navigate across them. Like an added bonus, nothing is as exciting as a speed run and dodge through hordes of infected. What's more fascinating is the community mods and servers that offer custom gameplay experiences. The first person shooter is simple to grasp with absence of any hud clutter. Player interaction with health and healing makes it a fabulous team work experience and sometimes demanding as in the realism mode.

Now let me point out the 'bad'. It's valve engine and thus is never bug free no matter how many patches they release. While a good teamwork makes the gameplay exciting, some community servers offer cancerous and salty players that just restort to team killing and notoriety. Reputed servers are known for weeding out such players and keep a balanced gameplay.

Nevertheless, the first thing you do is jump straight into one of many community servers for coop campaign and play wisely. You wanna avoid accidental team killing and straying far away from the team while providing support as much as possible. Sure, you may also wanna start farming for points whilst your mates are left for dead and still complete the campaign like a pro. You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain!

Left 4 Dead 2 is a sequel to the original Left 4 Dead, a zombie shooter set in a variety of locations. Each campaign has 4 survivors, who have to reach the safety vehicle or area on the other side and have to fight their way through tons of infected. There's also versus and a lot of other game modes.

PROS: 
+ Teamplay can make a real difference. Good communication and teamwork seem to be more important than skill
+ Good replay value: the director spawns infected, objects, weapons and items randomly each time, making playing the same maps over and over less repetitive
+ A balanced amount of weapons that satisfy in both audio and visuals
+ A good variety of game modes, difficulties and alternate playstyles that can deliver a challenge or a different type of experience. Has expert realism gotten too easy? There's a bunch of mutations that step up the difficulty by a whole 
+ This is a game that's very user-friendly in supporting the use and management of add-ons in a simple and clear-cut way instead of having to learn about managing files, extensions and whatnot. You can download, use and delete mods all without leaving the game and you rarely have to open any files on your desktop
+ The Source engine and console make adjusting the settings to your likings easier and is a comfortable engine to play with
+ Trading cards

CONS 
- L4D(2) is infamous for its toxic community, especially in VS and the forums. This is mainly because of how suitable this game is for trolls (friendly fire, suicides, etc.). Joining or starting public games has a fairly present chance of inexperienced, arrogant or annoying players, psychos, grievers or trolls joining and ruining the game. A lot of people are playing on difficulties that they cannot handle, sometimes solely for the sake of causing unrest. To gauge an idea of what this is like: our former server's banlist had accumulated over 350 banned players in under a year and after 2000 hours of L4D2, I had over 400 people blocked on Steam due L4D2
- The maps can get repetitive after a while, despite the director randomizing entities 
- (Rare) crashes, glitches and disruptions in both sound and visual. This is partially related to add-on collision
- a more recent con, the official servers are constantly struggling to stay active, it seems

If you plan on playing L4D2, I highly recommend you friend some nice players, play with friends or play on a moderated server (admins that kick troublemakers), because at some hours, playing this game on the highest difficulty is near impossible due to the type of players mentioned above. 
Nevertheless, L4D2 is a great game that can be tons of fun and you'll likely keep coming back at it for many hours. Definitely a recommendation for players who enjoy teamplay.

P.S. about "Product received for free", I got this game for free during Christmas 2013, which makes me a Ghost of Christmas Present player.
A lot can be said about this game, but there's something specific I want to say about this game after seeing the popularity of recent multiplayer games like Evolve and Payday 2.

Left 4 Dead 2 is a great example of replayability done right. It doesn't try to keep you playing with progression, but with sheer FUN. While a lot of online games these days will beat you over the head with an experience bar and taunt you with unlockables, Left 4 Dead 2 doesn't keep anything from you, and from the word go, you have access to whatever equipment you find randomly strewn across its maps. It focuses on making any given campaign run or round of versus unique and interesting, and you as a player get to enjoy the journey instead of simply anticipating the destination. This isn't a game where you grab the SMG because you want some kind of SMG bonus afterward, or you sneak past a sobbing zombie woman so you can get an experience bonus the next time you play. This is a game where you grab a shotgun because you want to shoot that Witch in her stupid, crying face.
I recommend it but it depends on your tastes in zombies games trully but here is what I will say

1-You will hate Carnivals to the end of your days
2- you will hate Gnomes
3- dont expect once you join a random game someone to save you 
4- the game is fun with good friends
5-even if you dont have anyone to play it with Mutation is just for you !
Despite not getting all of the achievements in this game, or experiencing absolutely everything, I think 160+ hours of playing this game over the past two years is well enough for a review. 

Instead of taking the typical "focus on the infection with generic, cardboard as all heck survivors", the survivors are very enjoyable characters with well written dialogue and memorable performances. And I'm not refering to just the L4D2 cast, the L4D1 cast is also great! It's quite entertaining to hear how these people interact with eachother in this kind of setting, especially when the two casts meet up in [i]The Passing[/i]. Of course, the zombies do get their attention given they [i]are[/i] what you'll be shooting/hitting/tearing to shreds.

Gameplay wise, there's plenty of replay value with various gamemodes, campaigns from both L4D1 and L4D2, mutations which can greatly change how the game is played, and different things that might occur within said campaigns. RNG plays a big factor here, as it determines what guns you might end up with, what special zombie types you'll encounter, the items you'll find, and various other things. Maybe you'll get lucky and find two medkits halfway through the map instead of one bottle of pills. Or maybe you'll get [i]unlucky[/i] and get sniper rifles with a Tank up ahead, ready to cause havoc. Regardless of that, this game is still pretty darn fun to play, especially if you bring friends along.

As for presentation, I'm surprised how well a game from [b][i]2009[/i][/b] not only still looks good, but sounds good as well. There's maaaany hidden details you'll likely glance over when playing through the game, such as the various writings on the safehouses you enter, providing story for some of the folks that live within that area. Or perhaps the fact there's a couple minigames you can find in [i]Dark Carnival[/i], some of which tie into achievements. Or maybe even [spoiler]Bill's corpse still remaining in the very spot he died at in [i]The Sacrifice[/i] when visiting that area as the L4D2 survivors in [i]The Passing[/i][/spoiler].

Of course there are some issues, but it's not really the game itself. If you're playing Left 4 Dead 2, play with friends. While you might find good and/or nice randoms, you'll more than likely find folks who'll kick you at the sight of making a single mistake, even on Versus. Speaking of online multiplayer, you won't find many people, if [i]at all[/i], playing Scavenge. Good luck getting those achievements. The AI, while it can autoaim, is pretty bad. Wouldn't recommending relying on one to keep you up in battle. Another issue I have is that due to L4D2 containing everything L4D1 had (and even a mutation that prevents L4D2 specials from spawning, making it just like L4D1), this makes L4D1 almost pointless to purchase other than to say you own it.

Overall I would recommend this game to just about anyone, with the added note to play with friends and have a stable internet connection. And I haven't even mentioned the Steam Workshop, which can add [i]even more[/i] content in the game. [strike]achievement hunters will scream in agony from a few achievements though[/strike]
This game is the reason I joined Steam.  I'm not really into zombie games, but the characters seemed pretty cool, so I gave it a chance.  It's pretty fun, especially with friends.

( Rather short due to me trying to rush out a review before the Steam Awards nominations ends.  I do quite like it though, and suspect many others will as well. )
It's good. You should buy this instead of left 4 dead one as it comes with all the campaigns from left 4 dead one. Oh, and a full workshop full of free mods for your game.
Played it, loved it. 
So yes, where do I begin? This is probably the most teamwork-oriented game I'll ever play. Not even Team Fortress 2 can compare to the importance of teamwork in a game like this. I can't stress enough that spelunking alone will get you killed. 

Gameplay in general? It's alright. I'm no professional critic, but I can say it's simple enough to understand. Shoot zombies, get inside safehouses, try not to die.

Oh and I love the voice talents. So many lines for performing a single action, like apologizing, getting saved, and even looking at safehouse graffiti.

Good game.

Left 4 Dead has always been an amazing game and it's still pedaling to this day, the majority of people have this game and are not dissapointed with it.
The best fast paced coop game out there.
Here are the major points that marks L4D2 unique in its genre.
• Diversity of modes: Single Player, Coop, Versus, Survival, Scavenge and mutations (custom game modes, you can even create your own if you desire to).
• Variety of weapons: from a frying pan to a grenade launcher, from a desert eagle to a ak47 and so on.
• The characters are well-written, each of these individuals has their own personality and background story.
• Despite being coop game it has a linear storyline, which makes the gameplay more interesting.
• Campaigns are just great -- the designs, the environment, the visuals, everything is well placed. Plus the random events between the campaigns are tedious and challenging.
• Thanks to "The Director" (A.I.), it brings replayibility through the campaigns, which makes every playthrough different.
• L4D2 still holding an active player base, most games don't survive that long. Finding a match won't be a problem.
• Modding is what makes this game even better, custom content such as campaigns and mods are just awesome. 

I don't know why it took me this long to make my own review.
10/10
Best zombie apocalypse co-op game i have played. I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a first person shooter zombie game, not that hard if played on lower difficulties and for players looking for a challenge theres realism mode. Extremely easy to add mods trough steam worshop. This game is suitable for anyone.
[b] Left 4 Dead 2 [/b]
Good ol' game. Good old times.
My very first purchased game. It's fun , FUN To play. For a game based on the DEAD ,the Community, the Workshop ,the game itself ARE'NT DYING. Played this game originally a year later after it's release, and its almost a decade, people still play it. I came to a conclusion that I never abandon this game, just do pauses, and take breaks from playing it. and its 2019 already dammit! Going to the feature part.

+) Like I said. The game about dead , which is 10 years ALIVE !
+) Game Modes, Campaign, Survival, Scavenge, Versus, Realism both Campaign and Versus. 
+) Guns. Lots of em. and the gun play just feels good.
+) The infected. Come in two groups. Common (the simple hordes of the grey decaying humans) and Special (lucky losers mutated further into abominable new half-human species) 
+) The AI Director (it's also in my (-) section. see below) makes random spawns of everything, guns, healing items, infected which makes the game replayable over and over and over and over, and over...and over? and over! again!
+) Steam Workshop. It also supports the replayability of the game thanks to its contributors (Bless em'♥) and with some few mods and tuning you can replace the default vanilla game and add new colors to your playing experience.
+)Gameplay is dynamic, aggressive, and you're always on the move. The key feature of the zombies (called in its lore as Infected) ...they are, fast. unlike their slow and rather dumb counterparts.. they run, climb,jump, break through, do whatever it takes to reach to you! 

But it also has some downs too. 

-) The Survivors differ only by their appearance, none of them have their special traits, bonuses penalties. Just by their looks.
-) Ai director. Mostly, spawns of the infected. The higher the difficulty the closer the infected spawn. Sometimes they may spawn just a few feet away ,not in your field of view but almost behind you. And even RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU (this only occurs in two spots : safehouses of the chapters Stadium (Dark Carnival) and Airport (Dead Air))
-) These 2 Chapters partcularly again. On higher levels they can be very frustrating (especiallu if you're a pistol player like myself) due to its spawing specifics. Hordes just spawn constantly and run towards you, they can even spawn in RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU (if you managed to reach for the safehouse first, you'll see it yourself), and there is no time delay between the hordes. They just simultaneously charge at you. Those two scenarios are really at odds with survivor players.
-) (Versus Only) Special Infected are limited in ranged attacks to parry against the Survivors. Only 3 of them (Spitter, Tank Smoker) can do at least something from a distance. Well surely it encourages you for teamwork but basically it feels like ''bringing a knife to a gunfight).

So far I came up with this much. I intend to re play it again soon enough. like I said. ''Left 4 Dead 2'' is an immortal game. 
100 % recommend and must have for any Steam user,and zombie-horror genre lover. Too bad we cant know for sure are they gonna have any sequels in the future, but this one always is ''♥'' here for me. Long LIVE Left 4 DEAD 2.

That's all. Always bet on blue.

This game is fantastic! This game is some of the most fun I've had with friends. You can always find something to do! What really makes this game so great is the community and those on the Workshop. There is a constant stream of new mods for the game everyday and it can make the game a unique experience everytime. 
This game never gets old and is a timeless classic. Easily a game everyone should have in their Steam library. If you see it on sale I would buy it instantly.

Would highly recommend this game.
Once again another game ahead of its time developed by valve in the source engine. The constant wave of zombies makes the action seemingly never ending. The only bad side to this game is the repetitiveness. No matter how much you modify the game, its always the same thing every round but in all, i would reccommend this game.
I loved this game you get to download lots of mods and fight zombies, you guys have to give it a try! This is totally good for first person mode players
L4D2 in 2019 still is great, but playing in public servers. There are a lot of NSFW Servers out there, It's still fun to play in SP and with friends

Low System Requirements
Game doesn't look too bad on lowest settings and on 720P
A Game from Valve.
Yell at your friends every time you get snatched, pummeled or spit all over. The ultimate friendship killer and a perfect way to vent your frustration. Recommend?
It's very fun in the sense that you can pick up and play. But gameplay and story is pretty lame. if you are looking for some relief after a tiring day at work this game certainly helps.
This is the best quality game i ever played at the best price.
When i Mean Best quality it doesn't mean the best graphics and effect but the game quality, the stories, campaign is the best. Every other game is expensive and have good graphics but it doesn't have good game quality as left 4 dead 2. You will not regret buying this game. You will never find any game that is good quality as this at this price. I got this yesterday and only played 5 hours but it is worth it. I am not forcing you to buy this but if you have even the slightest thought of wanting to buy this game, you have to buy it. I was thinking if this game was worth the money. I was wonder for about a few days. When i bought it, i regret it for not buying it ages ago.  

YOU WILL NEVER FIND ANY GAME AS GOOD QUALITY AS THIS AT THIS PRICE!!!!!
Almost 10 years after the sequel hit and I still get drawn in to binge it from time to time. The devs completely nailed delivering an experience which is not only different in some way or another every time you play it, so that the action rarely gets repetitive despite playing the same 10 campaigns over and over again (not including custom maps). Playing public matches was absolutely awful a year into L4D2's existence, but it's become much better than it used to be, although you will occasionally run into that one moment where you got pinned and nobody came to save you until you're either down or dead...from like 5 feet away from you, lol.

Workshop's been a gigantic boon for this game, and further amplifies how unique(ly hilarious) experiences can be; remember that time my buddy Nick turned into a goat and sliced Shrek in half with a kawaii-ass chainsaw? Well that's what I saw in my game, at least. The 3 others, I dunno about, but was probably some shit just as crazy.

Playing this really makes me miss when Valve was dedicated to making not-Artifact games. At least we got graced with this series before they clocked out.

Oh right uhh, recommended? Totally, the game's really fun if you can find some friends to play it with, buut public servers will still do you more justice than the somewhat-slow bots ever could. It's like what, $9 now? That's a steal, hands down.
Ah, Left 4 Dead 2. I remember playing this back in the day, alongside Left 4 Dead 1 with my school mates. 

Being the sequel to the first game, Left 4 Dead 2 introduced new special zombies such as the Charger and Spitter. At the same time, there are also unique zombies that can appear, depending on the map. For example, there are zombies wearing hazmat suits, making them invulnerable to fire. Melee weapons and weapon upgrades were also added, giving players more options when it comes to fighting the zombie hordes.

Gameplay wise, the Left 4 Dead series basically defined a game type. You can hear people going "It's like Left 4 Dead" or "Similar to Left 4 Dead" when they try to find a way to describe gameplay in other games. Players will find themselves starting out with basic weaponry and as they make their way through the map, they'll eventually find more weapons available to them which come in handy at certain points of the map when you have to defend yourselves while waiting for an obstacle to clear or your transport vehicle to arrive at the end of the map.

The campaigns are designed to emulate "movies" in a way, with an AI called "The Director" dictating the ebb and flow of the campaign dynamically depending on the players' actions. This way, no two playthroughs will end up the same way but once you've played the game enough, you might be able to predict what's going to happen next. 

Sure, the game might be quite old by now but it's still a classic co-op game to hop into with friends from time to time when you just want to mow down some zombie hordes. If you don't have any friends available to play with you, you can also play the game in singleplayer mode with AI teammates who are pretty good as well.

With Workshop support, you can customise the game to be your very own version of the zombie apocalypse. Share your mod lists with your friends so that they can experience the game your way as well.
Left 4 Dead 2 is a 4 player coop, zombie FPS game. Despite having completed all the campaigns, I still come back to this game because of its great gameplay, graphics and overall feel. With many gamemodes such as survival (wave defense), campaign (go through a series of chapters to get evacuated) and versus (you can play as zombies!) 
Great Game!!!
Left 4 Dead 2 is a really good survival co-op horror game

I mainly play it with my friends and we still have fun on that game even after years
Every game you play will never feel like a déjà-vu and it makes it replayable as much as you want, plus the addon support and custom campaigns adds even more replayability to the game
That game also has a competitive mode where you can play zombies and break some friendships >:D

I recommend you to buy L4D2 instead of L4D1 since it has all of the L4D1 content plus more weapons plus workshop support and with all of that better graphics
Personally, I have always found Left 4 Dead 2 inferior to the original, and not because it was worse, necessarily, but because it has never felt as balanced or as pure. The original had fewer weapons and fewer special infected, but it has always felt finished - everything served a purpose. The sequel added additional weapons, including a melee weapon system, more special infected, more survivors, more items, and more bells and whistles in general, and it has always felt like too much after the minimalist purity of its predecessor. Then, Valve added the original survivors and original campaigns to the sequel and made Left 4 Dead all but redundant. However, while I enjoy chain sawing zombies and surviving all of the new campaigns, I would still rather play the original title, without mutators, without gas tank search matches, and without mad crescendo sprints through never ending hordes of infected.
I played over 100+ hours of this on Xbox 360 so of course I had to put in at least half that time here. 
Classic zombie game. I love playing this on stream or just when I'm bored and I always have. Get it.
very fun game with friends, it is 'okay' alone
very moddable, could turn it into an even more immersive zombie coop shooter
or into anime trash
both just as fun
8/10
Valve was pretty clever when they released this game, if you think about it its just a zombie survival game that once completed is pretty much over there is nothing more. But there is a trick why it remains popular and will remain this way for the next few years, it all has to do with many crazy fun and amusing add-ons that can convert this game in to something its not. You can replace the characters, items, maps and even change the gameplay. This game is kinda like one big emulator and you choose from a wide variety of roms that merge together in to something fun and mind blowing. Honestly i never played a game that has so many options of customization that it makes me wish that every game would be made in source engine. PS it will run on almost everything with a graphics chip on it even if its a Intel card.
Seriously, you newbies should do everyone a favour... stop being lazy, and check your settings before you play.  Stop getting yourselves into an expert game and bringing the rest of the team down.
In the time I have had this game, I have had a BLAST!! The game is smooth, fun, and has just enough fun little quirks and gamemodes to keep you intrigued. It is more fun to play with friends, as campaign can get stake if you just it by yourself.
One of the best games to play with your friends , until lately since all the official servers are down and no one is working on it , thanks for killing one of my favourite games
This game is really awesome, i love it!
My favorite campaigns are Dead Center, The Passing, The Parish and The Sacrifice!
And my favorite character is Nick, he's really really mean, but i like him anyway!
I want to thank my brother for showing me this awesome game, those 95 hours were bomb, and i'm planning to play more, even as long as i live!

If you're thinking about buying the game, do it! 
You're missing out, just like i was!
Listen, Im done with people calling me a homosexual. Im done with it, You guys have gone into the comments and told me many times im a homo. Just because i touched a penis in the highschool showers once doesnt make me gay. One guy thought it would be funny to call me a homo and the rest of you are doing it, so from now on, If i catch one person in the comments calling me a homo im going to report the comment and block you. I am above the law and can get every single one of you in jail for harrasment.

Let it also be noted my IQ is much higher than most of you, so dont try me. Infact, In the second grade when asked to take a SAT in a spur-of-the-moment time, I scored in the 99 Quartile. That was higher than 99.9% of the population, Any higher would of been margin of error. So next time you think you are smarter, Just know i also understood physics and computer science better than my uncle when i was just 9 years old. To this day, I still have wrote over 30 books detailing different ways in which calculus and physics are flawed, and i still have had multple colleges use them in introduction to calculus.

Moral of the story, Anyone caught calling me a homo is probably going through a rough time themselves, and i will block them because my high IQ told me
looks like we are both posting copypastas at the same time
A good game to kill both time and zombies. Don't worry about the 2 in the tittle, apparently, you can play the original campaign here, so, you can jump straight into it. There's also mods, and all the good and weeb that comes with them. No, you didn't read that last part wrong.
If you enjoy single player i bet you will enjoy it, and even multiplayer can be fun, but i must warn you that if you start up a server and someone you probably have no connection with what so ever, uses some form of cheat/hacks on a server you own, be prepared to be given a vac ban on the game because valve can't be bothered to go in depth on what happens in multiplayer servers. I was playing on a multiplayer server i was hosting and set it to public in an attempt to get new friends that played this game, however, a certain player decided to join my game and use some form of cheats or hacks or whatever the hell valve decided to blame me for using on a server i was hosting.later i was playing solo for a bit then went to bed, then when i woke up, a vac ban is on my account, while the person themselves was not given anything
i was given punishment and now can never play online anymore.

this is primarily a message to valve to stop giving false Vac bans to people, and start banning people who are cheating, you don't have to remove the vac ban if its for some reason that difficult, but for crying out loud stop punishing people with vac bans that do nothing wrong.

I really want to like this game and i really do, and it can be fun at times, but this is a serious issue,
after paying for the game and then getting a Vac ban several days later for something you didn't do is honestly just terrible moderation.
It may seem like a great deal to get L4D2 for maybe a dollar but the in-game community is somewhat toxic. It is better to play with friends than to play with strangers given that they might try to kill even though you did nothing wrong.
gameplay is good for the price. multiplayer is the way to go. but there are barely anyone that plays this in Australia. So don't buy this if you are from Australia or any isolated country with small population.
Good game, if you can get into a game. You get stuck in the loading screen constantly and it becomes a lottery to finally get passed the loading screen and into the game.
E.Wolf's -5*

1. This game is designed to be played with friends. Since my friends do not play it, and I do not make friends easily, I found playing with strangers to be boring and the game was more difficult than it should be.
2. The game really sends a lot of tough enemies at you. Survival is not easy but getting outnumbered and overwhelmed is.
3. The graphics are not great. Although this game was released in 2009, Valve had quite a lot of money by then. I feel that sticking with the Source game engine for such a long time was a poor decision.
4. As a fan of first-person shooter games, I did not enjoy using the weapons in Left For Dead 2. The animations are not great, again referring to the game engine, nor are the sounds. I also felt they were too weak to deal with the zombies and there was no point to ammo conservation as I would always be out of ammo.
5. I do not like how quickly the zombies move. For a game that is all about killing countless zombies in the endless hordes, killing them is not so easy to do but getting surrounded and killed is very easy. 

*Normally my reviews contain five topics with all of them being either positive or negative to provide consistency through the entirety of the review. However, Left For Dead 2 is a unique game for me as it has well over one hundred thousand positive reviews, yet I have a negative opinion of the game that goes beyond my own inability to enjoy the game but also includes my negative opinion of the final stand-alone product. In order to alleviate the amount of hateful comments this review will receive from both casual and fanatical players, without leaving the "Allow Comments" checkbox unchecked which prevents fair discussion of this review, I provide a BONUS topic that is positive to align with the plethora of players who did enjoy this game and continue to enjoy it.

BONUS: The dialogue in Left For Dead 2 is incredible. The characters are decent and have their stereotypes combined with uniqueness to provide believable characters, but it is their dialogue that makes the game so much more enjoyable and memorable. As you battle against endless hordes of zombies, the dialogue brings the game to life completely and makes every round a fun and unique experience. You will truly enjoy your favorite character just by listening to their random dialogue. I will never forget the stories about "my buddy Keith".
I've played the game for a long time with my friends and we always splayed versus. Then the update came out and ruined it all. 90% of the time maps don't even load and mods can't be used.
- Haven't touched the game in years and was universally loved by many. 
- 1 Update
- Versus no longer loads half the time and mods are disabled on all officially dedicated servers.
- Good job Valve, you actually Cucked yourself.
This game is implemented in a high reactive sub market. There are no description about that before. Just the standard disclaimer. You buy the game and it trades on you. You can't compare it with other forms of game-commerce.
Thanks for gaming,



NEEDS AN UPDATE 

COME ON VALVE ITS BEEN 10 YEARS!!

NECESITA ACTUALIZAR
DALE VALVE YA SON 10 AÑOS!!!


El juego es muy bueno si , pero solo jugar 9 campañas (left 4 dead 2) y las 5 porteadas del primer left 4 dead.

Jugar versus ya aburre. 80% de las veces te manda a un server modificado y tal . no son malos pero despues de un rato aburre jugar allí.

El juego es mejor con amigos ( ver la pared tambien es mejor acampañado).

Team Fortress 2 y Left 4 Dead 2 necesitan la atencion de Valve desde hace varios años.

Sinceramente un fan.

Yes the game is good an all that but seriously going through the same  9 campaigns (left 4 dead 2) and the 5 ported from the first left 4 dead is boring at this point.

Yes playing on versus increases replay value , but come on. its seriously boring after a while.
And yes 80% of the time you end up on a modded server they're fun for a while but they get boring fast.

Team Fortress 2 And This game seriously need a update! come on valve!

Yeah is better with friends i suppose (staring at a wall is also fun with a friend)
