Very fun game, do NOT let the graphics decieve you.Here, I'll list the pros and cons of the game:

PROS:
1.People dont talk much,so not much of a risk of being called "faggot" or any of that shit.
2.Better than COD
3.Cheap!
4.Fun gameplay with a large assortment of weapons

CONS:
1.For some reason,it lags for me.I have no idea why.
2.Graphics are bad (But no one cares! :D)
3.Not many people actually PLAY the game.

So please,EVERYONE PLAY THIS!ITS FUN!
The 5 people that still play this are all boomers who mastered this back in 1999 and will yeet themselves across the sky with the Tau cannon and dodge every goddamn attack until somebody spams the magnum at them and still doesnâ€™t kill them
It's basically Half-Life, but in Free-for-all form. All the weapons from Half-Life are in here.

This game is DEAD though. So if you can host a private server and get a couple of your friends to play, then this game is awesome!

Great for fans of the original Half-Life. Not so good for people who just wanna play. There are much more people playing the original Half-Life Deathmatch and not the Source "remake" version. Just don't expect to find anyone playing on a Public server.
Half life deathmatch source is an amazing game, even though its pretty old and it has no next gen graphics, its still a realy fun addicting game,But i would have rated it 10/10 instead of 7/10 if there was actually someone playing it,
spend 300 hours using prop_dynamic_create to spawn thousands of blast doors to use as walkways, doors, walls, ceilings, floor tiles, garage doors, and garages. become the sole properietor of the color crew as you bound from kazakhstan-hosted server to russia-hosted server
Would be cool if people actually played the game. last I checked there were 3 active servers and no players. Do not purchase No one plays this!

great game but it is dead.
It just appeared in my library and I didn't know what to do, so I played it.

And how grateful I am that I did, it's gameplay is simple, but still fun, there isn't anything competitive and it just feels like a breath of fresh air from highly competitive games like LoL, Dota, CS and COD. Playing this felt so good and refreshing with no one raging or hacking and there isn't even voice chat to bear risk of driving everyone mad.
The 15 or so people that play this game come and go, being happy and silent as the familiar scramble to the nearest weapon becomes a new chalenge of getting those guns off the person who has the most.

Classic Deathmatch the way it should be, to be played casually or religiously, 10/10
One of my all time favorite games, where evern if you're bad, you still have fun.
Been playing this game since 2004, and still nobody can take me down. ;)
Unfortunately there's only ONE active server. And that server is broken, and kicks you every 7 minutes for "being AFK". The server is also based in EU, so don't expect a ping lower then 150.
This game needs to be revived, I miss my favorite game.
In it's current state, it's unplayable. Literally.
[h1] Half-Life Deathmatch: Source [/h1]

This deathmatch game is really great, lots of maps and weapons that make my nostalgia go crazy!
but the game is dead... I have played some hours with some awesome people, we hit a total of 10 people on one server for two hours!

The game is a little broken, in lots of maps some of us couldn't pick up ammo and there is some people that learned how to use the broken part of the game for there advantage (some wild jump kills and stuff)

Unfortunately, I only give 5/10.. mostly because the game is dead, but I still recommend this game because its a great game!

[h1] 5/10 [/h1]
Magnum and Shotgun battles are fun in this game....
      So are crowbar battles...
    Hell everything about this game is FUN
Lets get to Brass Tacks here Half-Life Deathmatch is a fun old school FFA game similar to quake.
 The game isn't that popular so you might come across a few servers that might have a few people playing up to 3-5 people playing which can be a real downside.

This game is worth a try but I'd have better luck finding more players to kill on HL2 Deathmatch.
 Overall expect a classic FFA game. My personal favorite guns are the 1-2 shot Magnum which can offer some exciting gun fights.
This one of the best multiplayer game out there, amazing to play with friends. I recomend giving it a go, all though there aren't many player online if you manage to go in a server every single penny of the price will be worth it.
[b]PROS:[/b]
+ fun gameplay
+ lots of mods

[b]CONS:[/b]
- not that many active players

[b]Comment:[/b]
Same case as with Team Fortress Classic, I've missed the golden days of this game when there were many players. Nowadays the community of active players is small and there are not a lot of games to join. I got this game with some other Valve games I wanted so I took a look at it. It's a classic Quake-type shooter so there isn't much to criticize. Gameplay is fun but lack of people to actually play with pulls down the experience.

Multiplayer edition of Half-Life: Source. As many of the other reviews have said, the game is broken and dead. Don't bother buying unless you're buying Orange box or any other bundle.
Half Life Deathmatch Source is a lot of fun. If you're bored of TF2, HL2:DM and all the other Deathmatch games you could give this one a go if it's in a steam deal.
a crazy fps set in the half-life universe! theres none of that pay to win bull so its actually very fun. although theres a better chance of half-life 3 coming out than for you to get into a full lobby.
this fucking game may be dead.but there's still server's that are alive.this comes with hl2,so you can uncheck the box if you don't want it.still pretty good game,the ragdolls may be broken due to the source engine 2010 update,still good game.
So far I got to  say, despite the game being practically dead because not alot of people plays it anymore, I am actually impressed on how fun and addictive it is. You run around pick up weapons and shoot everyone else, no teams , just every man for themselves. Half-Life's guns may be OP and on paper may sound not suitable for multiplayer but if you can just simply avoid, you can counter the OPness of the weapons. You need plenty of skill and cat-like reflexes to properly play the game, and an extensive knowledge of Half-Life and it's Weapons.

I recommend people who are highly competitive, have fast reaction times, and like to play classic games.
This game is awesome. 

You start this game up, you get into a server and you have a blast.

The game doesn't have many players but when you find the right server you have a huge amount of fun.

The surviving community is friendly and very competitive.

This game is very good and it comes with Half-Life: Source which is a one up for me.

9/10 Would explosive crossbow someone again.
Blast from the past. How many people are playing Half Life games during this event? Its still a good game even though the graphics are old. Half life series are the first games that I had on steam.
This is Half-Life Deathmatch it defines the words [Gold Source Classic] but NOW it has souce technology. This game is very dated but that does not mean it is good. The only main problem I have for this game is that it is dead and there are usually only 1 server and it lags like hell so I do but I don't recomend it so I give this game a 5/10 score. The reason why is that this game is also full of many things such as you can't change player models. (just use the cl_playermodel command) but I do have to say this just to warn you if you ever want to play this THIS GAME IS LITTERED WITH BUGS. Elavators don't work as well as they used to and most of the guns are buggy like all hell but I would have to go mutual with this on a 5/10 score so Yes I do recomend it JUST USE CAUTION.
As far as free Multiplayer add ons go this is great and a whole lotta fun

Pros
From what I've played there seems to be quite a lively community of players for this game still 
This is some really fun old fashioned run and gun Death match action 
I don't typically play online games that often but I still had plenty of fun and even ended up winning a few matches 
There's plenty of maps to play on and no match was exactly the same

Cons 
I'm not sure if that much effort was put into balancing this and it may have just been released to add multiplayer for the sake of having multiplayer for instance a few weapons feel a bit OP like the shotgun and rocket launcher but even if this is the case the game's still super fun 

So yeah this is a pretty basic multiplayer add on but still super fun and I'd definitely recommend checking it out
----- PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING THIS! -----

This game is no longer functioning and should not be bought. A few years ago I would've recommended this game to everybody, but due to the Steampipe update back in 2013 this game was entirely ruined. Before I go on, let me define the word "ruined" as it's used in this context. By "ruined" I mean that this game is so properly glitched that you cannot even change your player model anymore! Yeah, that should give you an idea of how much Valve cares for their games. 

I blame Valve for this, but mostly an incompetent and lazy person whose name starts with an A and ends with a D, that was supposed to fix this using the input from the community on GitHub. 

So yeah, rather buy the normal HL because not only do you get the singleplayer portion of the game with the multiplayer, the online play is still functioning like it should and there is at least a player base. Oh, and if you are planning to buy Half-Life Source which is the other half of this, then don't. It might not be equally broken, but broken enough to make you mad.

Or just get Black Mesa, then you will at least get something that is prettier on the eyes and functioning like it should.
Half-Bug: Source. If singleplayer might still be acceptable, multiplayer part is completely broken. Honestly it feels like the game was ported just for fun during a few coffee breaks in Valve's office. Please play the original game (multiplayer is still crowded there, believe me) and don't waste your time on this. They only good side of this game is that you can run or build huge and beautiful maps thanks to Source engine, there a few fun maps in MP but that's it. If you want to experience Half-Life on Source engine, try Black Mesa.
[u][b]-Quick Review-[/b][/u]
Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is an exclusively multiplayer FPS developed by Valve, and released 2006 (God I feel old)
Basically Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is where you use all the weapons from the first Half-Life game, and you play against other people. Unlike another game I played over the weekend (09/03/16) there were actually people on this game. But there's not very many people playing this game.

[u][b]-Detailed breakdown review-[/b][/u]
[b]Story:[/b] The story is Gordan Freeman has gone batsh*t crazy and fighting against himself. Apparently once upon a time you could change skins, and there was a community for this game. But just like walking through a ghost town, all you see are the houses where people used to live. There are still PLENTY of servers to join, but no one to play with. It's always kinda sad to see this happen to a game.

[b]Gameplay:[/b] As far as I can tell, Half-Life Deathmatch: Source uses the same weapons as Half-Life. Just like Half-Life 2: Deathmatch uses pretty much the same weapons and features of Half-Life 2. The only difference is that as of now there are still people playing Half-Life 2: Deathmatch.

For those that like handholding and my sarcastic descriptions, here are the weapons you get: The almighty Crowbar, whom I informed everyone that I was a master of crowbar-fu. A pistol, which I had the accuracy of a stormtrooper... was it lag? or am I bad? The world will never know. You've got your revolver, which Chuck Norris can slam a revolving door [i](yeah, I stretched for that one.)[/i], your various assortment of SMG, shotguns, railguns, crossbow, laser tracking rocket of death, grenades, trip mines, alien gun, mining laser, and death-by-blue-vortex.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] I feel like it's weird to see Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is priced at $9.99, while Half-Life 2: Deathmatch is priced at $4.99... I guess it's that extra 5 dollars for the retro-status. *sigh*
This game is probably a pass, I could go either way on the recommendation status of this review. Based on what I played the game does what it's supposed too, there were a few people to play against, it wasn't a bad FPS death match game ... back in it's day it was quite the popular game, chances are you'll pick up this game in a half-life bundle, and truthfully you'll have more fun just playing Half-Life offline.
But, that's my thoughts on it, thank you for taking the time to read this review!

Not recommended unless you want a deathmatch game with lazily ported assets direct from Half-Life 1 with a horribly broken engine.

Get Half-Life 1 instead.
[h1]New isn't always better[/h1]

[b]Half-Life Deathmatch: Source[/b] is a standalone port of the multiplayer mode in the original Half-Life that was developed on the GoldSource enginge. This port makes the game run on the newer engine that is simply just called Source. Unfortunately better engine doesn't always mean better game.

Half-Life Deathmatch: Source does everything you would expect. Better sound quality, better poerformance on newer computers and simply just faster to boot up. Unfortunately Half-Life Deathmatch: Source is a lazy port and doesn't really deserve to be played.

If you want a better experience on the Half-Life multiplayer I would suggest for you to pick up the original [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/70/HalfLife/]Half-Life[/url] for better experience. Sure, the engine might be clunky and outdated but trust me, you'll have better time playing it over this mess.

What is so different about Half-Life Deathmatch: Source compared to the original Half-Life multiplayer? Everything. Half-Life Deathmatch: Source feels nothing like the original. You get stuck on things; the movement feels extremely awkward. And that's the biggest problem. Even though the newer engine handles physics better than the old one it still manages to screw up the mechanics of the old multiplayer. Then comes the random crashes. And last but not least, oh no no this one right here is a huge problem, are that everyone in the game are bullet sponges. Sometimes it takes an eternity to kill just one enemy. Unless of course you've hoarded each and every exlposive weapon on the map. Then the multiplayer just becomes a domination spree for you.

So I don't know... How could I conclude this? Buy the original, don't even consider playing this one.
The black sheep of VALVe's family...

This game is really fun, I've poured many great hours in it. But it is PLAGUED by bugs. Game breaking bugs that alter the way to play. It has been this way for nearly FOUR years and they'll probably never fix those. I willl not recommend this game until the bugs are fixed, this needs to change.
Once upon a time this game worked and was fun as i have been told
but then the steampipe attacked

no seriously steamipe fucked this game over... you should just get half life original, it's multiplayer  actually works 
(not sure if poeple are still there i havnt checked in ages)
Believe me, open the original half life 1 and play multiplayer there. Movements is way better with bhop and stuff. And in general theres more maps, mods and players.
I can't really recommend this game due to it's dying community that's just *barely* hanging on to whatever is left of itself. I thought it was bad in 2009, but now...It's just sad. 

Which is actually depressing to me since this game actually had a lot of history with my childhood. And to add insult to injury, the last updates Valve had slapped together to make the game "better", basically turned this game in a steaming pile of crap: I can't even change my player model anymore. I still have fun with the game every once in awhile, but it's just not worth the money now.

In short. Save your money and get something better.
While I like this game, it's something that you could simply find on a Half Life server. If you have Half Life, just do that. There's no need to spend $10 on a game that you might already own. I just got it for free with the purchase of Half Life 2 Episode 1.
This game is half broken now, there's no real good reason to buy it, Not unless Valve fix their "update" that made the game it is today. Get the orignal Half-Life 1 or get Black Mesa instead.
While this game is the what we all remember it over a decade ago, I am disappointed to say that I cannot recommend this game to anyone but a digital-collector. This game is an exact port/remake of the original Deathmatch. This version does not have as many people playing, (probably because the only way to get this game is to get the Valve Complete Pack), does not have extensive custom map support, and you can't change even change your player model!!!
