I love this game. It's different, rich in story, and will make even the coldest of hearts feel emotional. First time finishing the game (before I got it on Steam) I was up at 3 in the morning bubbling like a baby when I finished [spoiler]I chose the save Arcadia Bay ending and if you played it you know how upseting that ending was.[/spoiler] This game, although it has it's flaws, is a masterpiece. DontNod made a wonderful game and has proven that their small team can make an amazing, beautiful, heartfelt game. I paid for the 1st episode before it was released on Steam for free, but even spending a few extra dollars was worth it, as this game has taken me through the incredible and emotional journey of Max Caulfield and Chloe Price.

Pros:
[list]
[*]Beautiful indie sountrack
[*]Fun use of timetraveling powers
[*]Different (and stunning) graphics
[*]Relatable characters/situations
[*]Not afraid to talk about uncomfortable topics (assault, deaths of loved ones, suicide, ect)
[*]Most small choices still have a meaningful impact
[*]Strong replay value
[*]Many subtle refrences to shows/movies/memes 
[*]Likable characters
[*]Very atmospheric, it feels like a real town
[*]Has an unusual but nice mechanism where you can take a "Moment of Calm" and sit down on a bed/swing/bench, and just look at the world around you while calming music plays
[*]Beautiful locations and scenery
[/list]

Cons:
[list]
[*]Voice acting/script can be cringy at times
[*][spoiler]Despite the choices you make there are only two absolute endings[/spoiler]
[*]Is short (but as stated before is replayable)
[*]Can be cliche at times
[/list]

Overall this game is not one to miss. Even with it's flaws, Life is Strange is one game you shouldn't miss.
It's strange how this will be the first review I ever write for a game. I always thought it would be written for a game like Fallout, Elderscrolls or some huge open world survival horror. And yet it's this little piece of art that has me aching to write something, if only for a minute.
When I had finished this, a few minutes ago, I couldn't believe that they only charge a pittence for it. I thought to myself that if people can charge you 70 euro for games that are poorly executed and badly made from start to finish, then this game should have a much higher pricetag. It wasn't before looking up and seeing that I just finished the first episode in a mere three hours that I understood their reasoning. I feel, however, obliged to tell you all that the three hours spent in this game were worth more to me than the hundreads of hours I've spent in most other games combined. Not because the story was awsome, or the graphics made me gape in awe, but rather that every single aspect of the game in combination managed to grip me and pull me in so that time became temporarily meaningless. Imagine if games held this standard. Imagine if your favorite action, your favorite adventure game or even your favorite driver had this kind of execution. 
You can tell a good story in a bad way, and you can tell a bad story in a good way. The story in this game might not be the most interesting story you've ever heard, but it's good, and in the execution of it you are drawn in, captured by it, moved by it.

Most adventure games will entertain, they'll give you some ups and downs along the way, but ultimately they will feel like games.
I've never felt so fulfilled after "playing a game" as I did today. Original, beautiful and masterfully executed. I can't wait for the next episode.
I bought this game for £5. I now realise it is worth so much more; how I missed this game for two years I don't know, I'm glad I finally got around to playing it; I haven't felt like this in a long time after playing a game, a completely lifechanging experience. 

Life is Strange is slightly similar to games of the Telltale series, your choices affect the outcome of the game and make subtle and huge changes throughout. You feel empathy for the characters in the world, and whilst handling mature themes such as depression, the game grips you to your seat. It is amazing! A masterpiece. The writers are on par with some of the best TV shows and films out there, it makes you question every choice you make, your own reality. As a player you actually feel like you affect the relationships between the characters.

The music and art design are unique and aesthetically pleasing, which is a nice change from the usual games I play. The voice acting's brilliant, the lip synchronization is not so much, but it is not awful. 
Without spoiling anything, the twists in this game, WOW. I can see why this game has critical acclaim.

Finally I must end saying how much I recommend this game. I've experienced nothing like it before, if you read this. Please try this game. You won't regret it.
This is probably the realest review for a game I will ever do...
Coming from a guy who never shows emotions, has been gaming for a good 12 years and has mainly been playing horror, FPS, and MMOs those twelve years...

I both see and feel why this game has a warning about support groups for real life...
This game guilt-trips you so hard and then kicks your emotions around like it's a soccer ball...

I haven't had this much of an emotional roller coaster in, well... ever.
I've never had a video game make me tear up before...
Life Is Strange changed that.

Easily my "Game Of The Year". I know a lot of triple-a titles came out this year, and I know Life Is Strange doesn't get as much attention as other game... but holy hell you guys.
I've never played a game with such an in-depth story as I have with Life Is Strange...
Hell, I've [u]NEVER[/u] even played a game that kept me up all night, wondering about what the next episode will be, or how my actions in the last episode might impact me...

This is a game that I will never forget, and it is most likely a game that I will always come back to.



Now, for those of you that are thinking "ah, fuck this game. It's a story-based game, it's practically a virtual novel! Who cares!"...
Take this from someone who was "that guy", and said almost [b]exactly[/b] that before trying this game...
You will not regret buying this game. I promise.
This game is a moral self-torture simulator... Steps for successfully experiencing LiS:

1. Buy it.
2. Begin to play it.
3. Make poor choices.
4. Alter poor choices.
5. Realise new choices are worse. 
6. Eventually stumble to the end feeling like you've almost held it together. 
7. Make monumentally poor choice. 
8. Open the bottle of Jack Daniels you keep by your desk. 
9. Begin drunken reflection on reality.
10. Remember why you failed Philosophy.
11. Drink some more.
12. Ponder if this game has set an impossible bar for videogame storytelling.
13. Conclude it has.
14. Decide to write negative review of game because it made you feel sad. 
15. Change it to positive BECAUSE it managed to make you feel sad. 
16. Begin the slightly hollow search for something that can offer a similar experience.

I thought this game was overhyped.  It's not.
I thought I wasn't it's target audience / demographic.  I loved it.
I thought I wouldn't get involved with the characters.  I did.
I thought I wouldn't care about the choices.  I agonized.
I thought I could breeze right throught it.  I talked to everybody I could, exploring all options.
I thought I could play it and move on.  It stuck with me.
I thought I wouldn't cry.  I couldn't help it.

I thought it was a game.  It's so much more.

This was incredible.
Life is Strange isn't hard, yet it hits you hard.
Life is Strange isn't challenging, yet it shows daily challenges.
Life is Strange isn't long, yet its impact lasts long.
Life is Strange isn't a puzzle, yet it leaves you puzzled.
Life is Strange isn't giving questions, yet it offers answers.
Life is Strange isn't replayable, yet finds in the replay its core.
Life is Strange isn't real, yet it feels so.
Life is Strange isn't about relationship, friensdhip, love, hate, light or darkness. It's about the most underestimated gift: life.

I am unable to call it "game" as it would lose all the artistic veil surrounding Arcadia Bay. Art is something you perceive, it is something that comes out of the blue without a reason or a purpose. Art is something you can perceive in every step Max takes, and this is how I would label Life is Strange: art.
Dontnod has made a terrific job and gives us lessons that we can easily detatch from this title and apply it in our everyday life. All the serious themes covered in such a little time amount made me understand the reason why the developers have opened a support group for those who felt really affected by some of them.

And perhaps the core of this experience is simple and complicated at the same time:
Life is hard, life is challenging, life is short, life is puzzling, life is uncertain, life is one only, life is strange. But life..is life.
So, i finished the finale, and i was like, "what the fuck?! what the fucking fuck is happening?!"
And, yeah, fucks that the dev trying to get me make me complety fucked
Dev did a good job, kudos (y)
Life is Strange is a masterpiece, people should try this game at least the first episode
Forget about the teen drama, this game is not all about it, it's all about how you see future, past, and present time, every action has reaction, and most important thing that you can't fix everything
[spoiler]Enjoy the feel that you live in multiple different realities![/spoiler]

[my ep 1 experience so far review]
This game is so relaxing, i like to play it for another couple of hours just to see Max sitting under the tree, it makes me think about my strange life too :p
Things that i like about this game :
+ Nice hand-drawn graphic
+ Great music that follows your current mood
+ Interesting story, can't wait for next episode!
A must buy 2015 game!

~
So people asking about my "relaxing" part of my review
Maybe i should edit this
The relaxing part of this game maybe just for ep 1, when you advance playing to ep 2 and ep 3, it's the thrilling part, sad and happy and confuse and anger at once because you'll meet new characters, know the facts about your missing friend, or new environment (maybe?)
It's a rollercoaster feel when playing this game.
And still... i recommend you to feel the rollercoaster feel of this game.
[b]To not give this game a review would simply be an injustice, considering how deeply this game affected me and how genuinely thought-provoking it was.[/b]


I've played many episodic games but I don't think I can say there was one that made me pause the game several times, process what just happened, and then come back to it after a few hours. To say this game's perfect would be a lie, it's got faults like any other game, but where its strengths lie are in its ability to create a universe the player is incredibly invested in. I could rattle on and on like my usual Steam reviews but for this game only, and to avoid spoiling the story in any way, I've decided just to make a simple pros and cons list.

[u]PROS[/u]
- $20 price for the season pass
- Performance was good and there was very few bugs for me
- I really dug the unique art style (simple yet visually appealing)
- The UI is intuitive and very simple
- A solid story from start to finish (there might've been a few plot holes but I didn't notice any really)
- Likeable female protagonist and a well-written relationship between her and the deuteragonist
- Amazing atmosphere
- Great voice talent (I think a few voices didn't feel "right" but everyone else was golden)
- The song selection was fitting and appropriate
- Different endings which were logical and nicely executed, to me, for a story that involves time travel (one ending could've been longer though and I suspect many fans might've preferred something less predictable)
- Real choices that matter early on
- The rewind mechanic wasn't gimmicky for the most part and I rather enjoyed all of the puzzles
- The player doesn't take a backseat to the action like a lot of story games I felt (you feel like you're playing a game)
- A lot of extra content in the episodes (various diary entires, optional photos to take, SMS messages, etc.)
- Explores a number of controversial issues and/or themes (that few games touch on) with tact

[u]CONS[/u]
- The pacing could've been slightly better in episodes 3 and 4
- Past choices don't matter as much in episodes 4 and 5 (I won't describe anything more to avoid spoiling the story)
- Some characters are more or less stereotypes but each player will feel differently about this
- The rare corny/cheesy phrase that would stick out (I can't think of an example right now)

I was initially going to include another con but yesterday's update addressed what was the biggest issue for many: the at-times horrible lip-syncing that barely matched the characters' words in the first 3 episodes. I'm glad to say that this has been addressed and I have to give the devs kudos for that. Now fans and newcomers alike will be able to enjoy this game even more.


This game will obviously not be for everyone but I do think it appeals to a lot of people (as seen by the Steam user reviews). It's quite simply a high school drama with a bit of mystery and the supernatural thrown in. If you had thought it was some feministic sort of game like I had initially -  I urge you to give this game another look. I have tried to be as honest as I can about a game which I have thoroughly enjoyed and I hope this review has helped you, the reader, in some way. For $20 I highly recommend grabbing Life Is Strange and if you don't happen to enjoy it in the first hour or so: refund it. I don't think you will though :) It honestly deserves a 8.5/10 in my book.

Damn, I have never felt so emotionally attached to a game before.

10/10 Story 
10/10 Characters
10/10 Music
10/10 Game
10/10 Would play again

Game of the Year for me.
Episode 1: Dialogue is pretty poorly written. 

Episode 2: OK, this just got a little too real for me. 

Episode 3: WHAT IS HAPPENING

Episode 4: How can we abide so much suffering and malice to exist, and how can we not actively seek justice to right the wrongs and make the ugly things beautiful again? This was an eye-opening and terrifying experience, but such an important one. I legitimately feel that I am a more well-rounded and complete person. Literally kept me up at night while I prayed for the broken world. 

Episode 5: (silently sobbing)

it's pretty neat
There are only 5 or so games, films, or TV shows that have moved me as much as this game, Life Is Strange has. It is a hard feeling to deal with. The characters feel very real. You come to know many of them, and love them almost like real friends. Then the game is over, and those characters are gone. This causes a hurt inside you. Very much like losing dear friends, because there is no continuation for these characters.

This game is VERY emotional and deals with some very dark, and unfortunately very real things in our world. If you feel for other people, and nature, and the things only humans can cause, whether they are good or bad, this game might make you feel very sad at times, because it puts these things right in your face.

I cried so many times going through this game. I'm a pretty emotional person, but I think these feelings are totally intentional, and so I think the people who made this game did a damn good job. I wish to explore that world and those characters forever, because they seem that real. But, you can't. Much like the themes in this game about how little control we all have over time and events we can't foresee, this game ends and I have to find a way to move on.

The world in this game is pretty to look at. The graphics aren't amazing, but they are done in an artistic way that reminds me of watercolors or something. The gameplay is very similar to Telltale Games style, in that it is mostly walking around areas interacting with a limited number of objects, and talking to other characters. The real point of the game is the storytelling, and they do SUCH a good job in this one, as I've been over and over here.

I would recommend that if you do play it, take it slow, take long breaks if you need them. I took almost a year break and then several week breaks in between some parts, and it is still messing with me that I can't see anything more from these characters. Only replay the game again. Which, much like replaying a moment in the game with the unique rewinding power, only allows me to see that world again, and not live in it forever.

This review isn't much of a review, I know. But I don't want to reveal much and I just wanted to put my thoughts on this game out there somehow, even just to help me get through it. Thanks for reading if you do, though, and I hope you can enjoy this game that it seems to me a lot of work and love went into. :)
+ Interesting story and characters
+ Beautiful hand-painted visuals
+ A soundtrack that makes you feel good
+ Rewind the time and try something different
+ Explore what feels like a world that could exist
- Bad lip sync

A fresh and immersive game with a truly unique atmosphere. It lets you relax and have a good time. I can't wait for more.
Interesting story - Check
Characters you care about - Check
Good visuals - Check
Good gameplay - Check
Good soundtrack - Check

Well okay, the game can get a bit too cheesy for my taste at times but that's a personal preference ...other than that I absolutely love this game !

A friend of mine sent me a gift code for Humble Square Enix Bundle 3. I was delighted. The Bundle had several games, such as Murdered: Soul Suspect, The Last Remnant, 3 Tomb Raiders, and the first episode for this game called Life is Strange.
Not gonna lie I've been trying to get my hands on this game for a while but I always ended up buying other games (oh, I wish I could go back in time to buy Life is Strange, instead of those games).

[u]December 24, 2015[/u]
Oh, What the hell!? I'm gonna buy the rest of the episodes for Life is Strange. I don't care, it's Christmas Eve. It's a little gift from me to myself. I can't wait for the holidays to pass so I can finally start to play this game.

[u]December 25, 2015[/u]
Alright, the time has come. The time to start this epic journey, hopefully, alongside with Max and Chloe.
It's been so long since I first saw this game on the store, and yet I don't really know what to expect from this game. Like at all. I don't know what the story is about. Time to play it, finally!

[u]December 26, 2015[/u]
Today I played the first and the second episode of Life is Strange, and oh man, now I really wish I would have bought this game earlier, instead of all those other games. The story just started and I already feel such a strong connection to the characters. I don't think that any other game made me feel like this. Better continue this story, I'm so intrigued about what's gonna happen next. Can't wait to play it.
P.S.: Always go with Eggs and Bacon!

[u]December 27, 2015[/u]
Holy Crap.. This game is getting tougher and tougher, emotionally speaking. What the hell is going on?
Today I only could finish the 3rd Episode, and I can ensure you this is getting darker and darker.
I'm at the point where the decisions are getting harder and they start to have a great weight on the story.
Although I know Max can fix this situation, that ending just left me heartbroken.
I haven't even finished the game yet and I can't stop thinking about it. Goddamn it.

[u]December 28, 2015[/u]
I lacked courage and strenght to go through these last episodes, call me whatever you want, but this game took a toll on me. When I finally did it, I can say that I have never felt like this before. I think the correct word is desolated, yeah, I feel desolated. 
The story is absolutely beautiful, it has many twists, and the characters are so well developed that you can easily create special bonds with almost everyone. Graphically the game is beautiful as well, take your time to appreciate the little details.
Obviously I will not spoil you, but be aware, this game has no good ending. It has a bad ending and a worse ending.
I took the ending, that I consider to be the bad ending (morally speaking), and it doesn't make me feel that bad.
Afterall, friends are for life, right?

[u]December 30, 2015[/u]
Two days have passed since I finished the game, and I still can't stop thinking about it.
Sometimes I find myself reading Max's diary, and looking at screenshots and artwork of the game. 
I have to play it a second time to complete it, but it's still to soon, I have to recover first. I can't make Max go through all that again.
I had no idea that a game could make such impact on a person. This is one of my favorite games and I recommend everyone to play it. Jesus fucking christ, life is indeed strange 10/10
This game deserves a love letter, not a review. So here it goes..

Dear Lis,

Ever since you showed up, you’ve caught everyone’s attention. Although not mine, at least not until I kept hearing your name and seeing your pictures everywhere. Everyone talking about your beauty, perfection, mystery and how interesting you were. Boys and girls, all were in love with Lis. Which made me very intrigued. So I watched you closely but I kept a distance, because you were not even my type. I can’t deny it, sometimes I was attracted to you and wanted to approach you. But sadly I didn’t have money on me, so I couldn’t. So I accepted fate, and kept my distance.

Until one day, I had enough money. But I wasn’t sure anymore if I wanted you or not. I wasn’t sure if you would even notice me among all these 75 million users. I was just a nobody. I thought of other options, but for some reason, my heart preferred you. I don’t know why or what it was. But I knew you were the one. Among thousands of other choices, I chose you Lis... I think it was destiny. Do you believe in destiny Lis?

I still remember our first date. I waited for you for so long. Was a bad internet day. Then you finally came. I‘ve never been so excited to see someone this much before. And for some reason, something about you moved me. I felt this incredible strong connection between us. I felt ridiculously relaxed, comfortable, confident and very interested in you. We started getting to know each other, and you kept me even more and more interested in you. The date ended fast, even though it wasn’t really. It’s just that you made time travel faster than light. I hated it when you had to go. You promised me of another date, and that’s what kept me going.

The date was there, you looked even more beautiful than ever. Was another perfect day we had together. Until you touched me in a way, I couldn’t understand or know what to feel or think. Caught me off guard, surprised me. It was.. so good! Too good! But sadly you had to go. You left and left me with this fire burning inside me. So many questions, mixed emotions.. I didn’t know what was happening to me! So many questions going through my head. I wanted answers but I had to wait for the next time I see you. I was quiet the whole time, listening to you, melting with you, flying with you. You even brought tears into my eyes. It was a flawless experience. All my worries faded away and I was happy again. Then it was your time to leave, again.. but before you did, you rocked my world!! You left me again with all these emotions and questions. What were you doing to me Lis!!? These feelings, never felt anything like them before, ever! What happened on our last meeting has been on my mind since you left. You were all I could think of. Waiting for our next meeting was the most intense feeling and important thing in my life at that point. But you were late Lis.. again.. I was scared, afraid that you changed your mind about me. That, you didn’t want me anymore. Until one day you said, October 20th you’ll be there. I smiled so wide until you said it was going to be our last time. It crushed me. Flipped my whole world upside down. I didn’t feel like doing anything anymore. You kept me up everynight. I’d roll over again and again. Hearing your name and seeing your pictures in my head. Remembering the things you made me feel. I had hopes that I might be able to change your mind and make you stay. 

October 20th came. I was both excited and scared. I couldn’t see you. I’m so sorry Lis, I avoided you, stayed away from the feed. It hurt but I had to. Everyone was still talking about you, but it was only making me more furious.. But I knew I couldn’t hide from you forever, besides you were leaving me for good. So I needed to at least say goodbye.

October 21st. Which is today.. I waited for you. Again was another bad internet day. Then you showed up. My heart was beating so fast I almost fainted. I was so happy to see you again after so long, but at the same time, all those questions and emotions came back all at once. I wasn’t ready for it. It kept messing with my head the whole time. Taking me on this roller coaster of heightened emotions. Unanswered questions. You were vague yourself. You drove me crazy Lis. I had no clue what was happening. I was losing my mind and pulling my hair out. I was both scared and sad and happy and all at once. You’re doing it to me again Lis. Then when it was time for you to go, you just.. made me make the hardest decision of my life. I literally froze for 10 minutes. I didn’t know what to choose. I cared so much, it was so hard for me choose. But it didn’t matter after all, because whatever decision I was going to make, it wasn’t going to make you stay. So I chose. Tears started falling down one by one at the last sight of your beauty. The last time I hear your heavenly voice. The last time we laugh together, explore together, get mad together, get scared together, see the world together, and be happy… together…

Why Lis! How could you do this! I thought you were the one. I opened myself to you. We been through so much together! We changed past, present and future together! We created wonders! Put smiles on people’s faces! We made magic. It was all perfect. Then you just left me alone, sobbing, crying, screaming and bleeding love for you.

What I’m trying to say is that, I’m sitting here right now, writing this letter for you in my Asylum cell where I’m getting treated from the mind fucks and emotions you put me through, that all the choices we made, all the memes we made, all the ships we fought for, all the music we heard, secrets we discovered, emotions we felt, tears we shed... will all remain. They will always stay dear in my heart and I will always love you...

Yours truly.
Venus
This game features high school related drama from the perspective of a teenage girl. However the writing, art design, and atmosphere is done so well it will win you over. It tells a very human story while exploring the supernatural. The characters you interact with are entertaining and the story has a lot of heart to it. You are given the opportunity to make several decisions that will impact future episodes, which gives you significant input over the direction of the story. The time travel mechanic is used so well in this game as you try to solve puzzles, rewinding time to manipulate people and objects to your advantage. $5 for the first episode, well that's ok. I'm happily surprised & I can't wait for the next episode! =D
Episode 1: typical teen school drama

Episode 2: uhmmm.... wha..?

Episode 3: What. The. Hell.

Episode 4: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA?!

Episode 5: I'm... Sorry.



On a slightly more serious note: I cannot thank you enough, Dontnod. GOTY.
🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀[h1]My game of the year for 2015[/h1]🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀🎀

Overview:

Stunning, beautiful, emotional and magical. This game is amazing and delivers a lot, you'll find yourself getting attached and even crying over some of the choices and consequences. An episodic game of epic proportions!

💗 Pros:

+ Stunning story
+ Lovely graphics
+ Lovable characters
+ Great for screenshots
+ Choices are effective and testing
+ Great soundtrack, and very fitting
+ Has achievements and trading cards
+ Good implementation of choices matter
+ 5 episodes, all of which are gripping and lengthy 
+ They added developers commentary for free (it's dlc on the store page, just scroll back up)
+ Emotional, immersive and at some points heartbreaking, especially surrounding the choices with Kate and the final choice of the series.

❗ Neutral Points:

> Has been some bugs in rare occasions but easily overlooked due to being such a great game

💔 Cons:

- It ends
- Max's clothing, I prefer her in Amber's clothes
- Some choices don't have a big enough of an impact in the game
- It can be argued that no choices mattered in the end, not going to spoil anything though

Download Size: 11542mb
Trading cards: 6 in the set
Achievement Difficulty: Easy
Hours to 100%: 15-20

Rating: 10/10

Recommendation:

Despite the final choices and how it ends I am very content with the game as a whole and the build up, as well as the final outcome. It is a rollercoaster ride of emotions, hard choices and relatable characters. For me personally I got to re live a better school experience as a younger me while having time changing super powers. This is by far my favorite and best game choice of 2015, it was worth every penny and will always be a game etched into my memory. I'd advise you to grab this gem unless you are really not into episodic games.

For those who can't find the option to purchase the rest of the episodes: http://store.steampowered.com/sub/56692 (now fixed I am sure)

Nominated for 'I'm not crying, there's something in my eye' award. It deserves it!

I never knew that I like story driven games...
I never knew it would be so hard to make choices in the game...
I never knew I can be so emotional by playing a game...
I never knew the game can make such an impact on my life...
I never knew I could listen soundtracks from a game on repeat for so long...

...until NOW
I'm in love with this game.
[h1]Life is Strange is one of those things which hits you real hard and leaves a scar you want to remember.[/h1]
If you like that hipster, retro chilled out vibe, you got it. If you like to have the power to play as who you want to play as, you got that too. 
[b]This is Overwhelmingly Positive for all the right reasons, so go ahead, play all of it in one day, cry your heart out and get the next game. [/b]
It's not really a game, it's more like a long interactive, deep hipster movie. The story instantly grabs your attention and if it doesn't, get the second episode and see if it does then! 
Before you know it, you've played all 5 and are crying at something you never thought would. 
Also, the replayability is there too! But that might just be an addiction I have for it! ;)
Step 1: Try to make good decisions
Step 2: Fuck everything up
Step 3: Try to fix everything you've screwed up
Step 4: End up fucking everything up even worse

10/10 Best real life simulator I've ever played
Life is Strange is a work of art. This episodic graphic adventure features characteristics resembling those of a masterpiece. The game brilliantly displays the most impacting voice acting conveying the idea that it is real. The soundtrack that the game offers soothes the mind and works with the story beautifully. Every action and every decision that the player makes has consequences and there exists nothing that is excluded. This piece leaves the player with an experience that is unforgetable, one that will surely impact the way the player thinks from after they complete the game. The game not only presents graphics uniquely with a new way of expressing visuals, but also something that seems as if it was hand-drawn. The characteristics of the plot strike the player with such force that time is required to ponder over the elements of its development. The plot clearly exemplifies signs of originality, and the impression that things are not what they seem is boldly demonstrated. In addition, the game does a solid job at developing a crucial relationship between the characters and the player, leaving the player guilty or satisfied based on their decisions made. Life is Strange is the remark of the year of 2015, boldly establishing its place as one of the best games in history. I believe everyone deserves the oppurtunity to play this work of life lessons and morals, establishing its name as a game for everyone. Life is Strange is DONTNOD Entertainment's masterpiece, and nothing less. Life is very strange.

I wasn't sure what to think about this game, but as one hour passed and the next and the next I started to realise that this game is one of the best story-driven games I have ever played, nothing like ive ever played before. Choices are important and you have to chose carefully as they can effect the future. 


Pros:
+Story leaves you wanting more each time you finish an episode
+Great graphics and art style
+Great soundtrack
+Voice acting is spot-on
+Unique "rewind time" mechanic to try different choices.
+Great for screenshots
+ Explores a number of controversial issues and/or themes (that few games touch on)
+Movie feeling
+Game runs great

Cons
- wish the game was longer 

I would recommend this game to anyone 10/10
I never write reviews. I never like games that aren't fast paced. I am a 21 year old male. This is one of the best games I have played in my entire life.

11 out of fucking 10. I bought all of the episodes and cannot wait until they come out. There shouldn't be a single person with a PC who does not own this game.
No matter how old you are
No matter how young you are

No matter how tough you are 
No matter how weak you are 

Tears will get you...
Tears will get you ...
   I just finished playing the 5th episode 😭. It feels incredibly sad to say "Good Bye" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. 
   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. 
   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) 
   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. 
   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange. I wish you all the best and I'm looking forward to seeing more masterpieces from you.
I finished this game roughly 15 minutes ago and I'm still in a state of total disbelief. Even if this review seems cringy, I really don't care. I can see myself replaying this game when the shock of my first run through wears off. 

This game is a masterly written narrative which allows you to get really invested in each and every character you come across. A character you initially don't like, you can feel really sorry for, a character you love, you can hate. There is no black and white when it comes to this game, there is only a murky grey where each and every character lives. 

Truly, each and every choice you make comes back at a later date. Even if you think your choices are morally right, it doesn't make you right, and to write that into a game takes incredible skill and craftmanship. Each of your decisions matter and, even though you can't change what you choose, you'll always find yourself second guessing yourself and the choices you've made. This brings into perspective the choices you make in real life and how the decisions you make there might have lasting repocussions. 


I honestly cannot recommend this game more if you like a good narrative with relatable settings and characters. The former are places that are nothing special, other than the dream sequences ect, and you can clearly see yourself in each place. The characters you meet are people that you can quite easily meet every day, each has their own motives, ambitions and personality. It brings into perspective just how much you can judge people without clearly thinking.

Finally, there's the music and sounds. The music in this game is very similar to the music that I listen to daily, and each song comes on in places that I listen to music on a daily basis. The music in this game was added to my playlist without a second thought, namely Spanish Sahara and Obstacles. Alongisde the masterful music, there's the ambient sounds which are so delecately placed to make the enviroments seem more real. Gust of wind ect make you truly feel like you're in the environment Max is in. To be able to do this is, again, masterful and really brings into perspective just how much music can affect a game, or a person, each and every day. 

The overall theme of my review is perspective, and the main thing that has changed for me whilst playing this game is my perspective on numerous things. However, the most obvious area of perspective that has changed for me is my perspective on what makes a game narrative great. 


TL;DR - Did reverse Last of Us as my final choice, was shocked. Game music is great, story is masterful, choices matter, Syd Matter...
I feel empty. Traumatized. I'm completely different now. I played the whole series, now I don't know what to do with my life. I feel completely useless. It was a great time. But this game put it to another level. I never felt anything like this in a game. Thanks for this lifelesson game.
i cant explain how this game left me when i finished it 
its the only game ive played that made me drop tears  like a little girl 
if u wanna experience some emotional moments and turn into a little girl and start crying then buy this game 
its great for gamers who loves story games
now im playing it for the second time and im still having fun with it 
10/10
get it now
I cried less playing Dark Souls for the first time.

111% recommended if you like falling in love with characters that you'll spend your whole life wishing were real, only to find out you became them.
I’m playing Life is Strange, the stunning episodic game from DONTNOD Entertainment. I think I knew I was going to love it from the opening credits, as the protagonist steps into her high school hallway, sighs momentarily, and drowns out the gossip and hubbub with exactly the right indie song. Her internal dialog runs over the smooth lyrics and burbling guitar as she makes her way through the flowing river of students.

Back in the day, games were always about the gameplay. A game was good if it had fun combat or interesting mechanics. Gaming itself was still fresh and new, and the process of interacting with a computer and overcoming challenges was entertaining in its own right. Lately, though, that hasn’t been enough for me. A shooter where the plot only exists to keep you moving down the path towards the end of the game while both your gear and the enemies incrementally improve… it feels stale at this point. More and more, I’ve been moving towards games that skip the ‘action’ entirely in favor of the story.

The central mechanic of Life is Strange is a key reason it works so well. Max, the hero, gains the ability to rewind time in short bursts. Most games would use this as a way to liven up a combat system or to create intricate puzzles to navigate, but in Life is Strange, you use it to make choices. Everyday, normal decisions, at first — should you raise your hand with the correct answer in class or not? You see people’s immediate reactions, and if you don’t like them, you can go back and pick another option. Once your choice is locked in, though, there’s no going back.

This isn’t Fallout 4 — it soon becomes very clear that your choices have large and growing impacts on the world around you. Friendships and romances begin and end, lives are threatened, and you start to learn more about the characters, the world, and your powers. The ability to rewind time and change your choices leads to long moments of contemplation, exploring all of the options and carefully considering the ramifications, but other than your movement and the decisions, the game plays like an interactive movie. The perfectly selected indie rock soundtrack adds depth and feeling to the scenes and the voice acting is spot on. It takes place in a fictional town in Oregon, and it feels so much like the Pacific Northwest that it’s making me homesick.

I’m only a few hours into the game, and I’ve already completely screwed everything up. I was trying to save someone, but I just couldn’t make it happen. All my decisions have come home to roost. The haunting sound of Jose Gonzalez’s Crosses plays in my ears as the results of my decisions play out on the screen. I’m powerless to stop it.

It’s one of the few times a game has made me roll back in my chair and just sit, staring blankly at the screen and feeling the sick, sinking sensation of every poor choice I’ve made piling up on me, my good intentions useless in the face of what’s unfolding.

And, suddenly, the game isn’t about the game anymore. I’m transported back through my own life, reliving my pivotal decisions: dropping out of college, moving to Costa Rica on a whim, moving to Japan on another. The branching path of the choices that have shaped my life has never been as apparent to me as it is right now. I’m not distraught because of what’s happening in the plot. I’m mourning for all the other versions of me that I’m not — the ones who bounced down a different path because of an offhand decision, a minor, momentary, careless impulse that sent them spiraling off in another direction. The ones who worked harder, the ones who took more chances, the ones who played it safer…

I shake my head, jarring myself out of my reverie. I chase it away for good with the rest of the glass, the smooth burn searing my throat as I pull myself back into position, enthralled, gutted. All I can do is keep going.







                                                                                                                                                       Written by :
                                                                                                                                                       Ben Bagamery
Now I normally don't write reviews, but I'll make an exception for this gem.

Life is Strange is the only game that made me actually feel empty after finishing it, it is so well made, it doesn't even feel like a game anymore but like something actually happening, you grow attached to the charachters and actually care for what happens to them, especially Chloe and Max. The story is very well written and is very engaging, basically every decision you make will have further consequences, some are major, others minor and some are just so hard to make that you sit there not knowing what to decide for 10 minutes and after you chose one option you spend the next half hour thinking whether or not it was the right thing to do. Besides the great story there also is the soundtrack, which is absolutely stunningly beautiful, the music fits so well and only empowers intense or emotional scenes. Talking about emotional scenes, the game has lots of them, many of which will (almost) make you cry. Life is Strange is definitely the best game I've played so far, the amount of detail in this game is insane!

All in all I love this game and I can only recommend it.

A quote from Heavy Rain, a game I’ve played about 5 years ago, but came to mind while watching the ending of this artistic gem. After so much time, I finally dived into the universe of Life is Strange. After all the praise I’ve seen, and the huge fandom that seems to be everywhere (which is hella understandable), I finally have played Life is Strange. Life is Strange is an episodic story-driven adventure which relies in your decisions to change certain story elements as you progress. This is a formula already known by Telltale games, but completely revamped and explored in a completely different, interesting way.
[b][i]Are you cereal?[/i][/b]

You play as Maxine Caulfield, a photography nerd and not-so-popular student of Blackwell Academy. Blackwell is your stereotypical school portrayed in the movies and videogames, there’s the jockeys, the nerds, the cheerleaders and the usual bullying here and there. It all seems like a normal day, until our main character finds out she can manipulate time! This is how the game takes a completely different approach on decisions. You can always rewind and see what happens if you pick another line, or another action, giving you the opportunity to see most of the outcomes.
[b][i]I dare you to kiss me now.[/i][/b]

If you’re not aware, Life is Strange is split into five episodes, each one of them carries the decisions you have made on the previous chapters. The first episode is the introduction to how the game plays. It shows the decision and time manipulation mechanics so you familiarize yourself with the controls. It also introduces the set of characters in the Life is Strange universe. By the end of the episode we meet Chloe Price, a so long forgotten friend of Max Caulfield. Your adventure only really begins when you step into that van. Since this is the first episode, it is by far the most light hearted in the saga. From here on there’s no way back, the roller coaster ain’t going back, except if you’re Mad Max and can rewind time. It has been YEARS since I’ve experienced so many emotions with a game, I think the last one that hit me this bad was Metal Gear Solid 4.
[b][i]You finally came back to me this week, and... you did nothing but show me your love and friendship.[/i][/b]

The voice acting in some sections is absolutely superb in every way. There’s one part that only the voice acting itself and the spoken lines are enough to sadden me into oblivion, this happens on the fourth episode, in the Junkyard. It’s a completely heartbreaking scene and really well done. Fact is, this game is not perfect in some aspects, but when you sacrifice certain aspects and polish the rest, that’s enough for me to overlook the flaws. As an example, the lip sync is not really good, but it doesn’t matter at all, when the voice acting is just so good and emotional.
[b][i]What kind of world does this?[/i][/b]

The amount of references in this game really give it a unique feel and approach. It’s like Dontnod just felt like they had to squish a reference everywhere they could, and that’s amazing in my point of view. It makes the game more accessible and it becomes more familiar and easier to relate to. Maybe this is why we end up getting too emotionally obsessed with this game when it really turns for the worst.
[b][i]I hate that word… no offense.[/i][/b]

The game looks great, it’s pretty unique, it’s like realistic but cartoonish at the same time. I also noticed how we have a game based on a character that’s so much into photography and art, and the developers give us a game full of beautiful scenarios for us to “photograph”. There’s certainly tons and tons of screenshot worthy moments in the game, waiting to be captured. It’s like most of the game is a golden hour itself.
[b][i]Your life is still yours to live.[/i][/b]

Not to mention, the soundtrack. This is totally not my type of music, it doesn’t fit my style that much, but this game has me hooked on most of the songs. Jonathan Morali did an outstanding job composing the tracks for Life is Strange, and the licensed music fits the mood of the game so well, especially when those really emotional moments really kick you in the gut, and now you keep remembering them because you’re addicted to the soundtrack. Yes, yes I am addicted too. The songs rely heavily on beautiful and simple acoustic sounds, mostly on guitar, it sets a great atmosphere in the game, such a quiet sound in such a dramatic storyline.
[b][i]Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans.[/i][/b]

I won’t lie, this game has everything I wanted. It’s beautiful. It has great music. It plays well with the time manipulation elements. It has amazing characters that you’ll find hard to let go. It has decisions that will make you pause the game and stop for a few minutes, because you really don’t know what to do. This game has a heart. A hella huge heart.
[b][i]I'm so glad you're my partner in crime.[/i]
[i]As long as you're my partner in time.[/i][/b]

Dontnod need all the praise I can give, and more of my money. Speaking of which, I did get this for free. My friend gave it to me, since he bought the Limited Edition after playing through the game. I’m going to do the same, because I want these developers to make more amazing experiences like this. I’ve said it like a thousand times, I hate you for gifting this to me, but it’s okay, I now feel your pain too, thanks again Singast.

[b][i]Ready for the mosh pit, shaka brah.[/i][/b]

It’s unbelievably hard to express all of my feelings for this game. It’s a constant sledgehammer bundled with feelings hitting you in the back of the head every 15 minutes, they make sure that sledgehammer really takes the beating out off you. This game made me upset because of one fucking emoji. A simple emoji. Don’t even get me started on the endings, you’ll feel totally helpless and useless, so be ready, I was not. I ended up being selfish, so selfish. Then I saw the other ending, now I’ll never forget it for how gut-wrenching it was. (/;_;\)
[b][i]NO EMOJI[/i][/b]

My past 5 days have been a constantly focused in Life is Strange. It is all I think about, it is all I listen to, it is all I have been playing. For 5 straight days, I was playing an episode per day, and it seemed like I was living in Arcadia Bay, I was there! And it’s an adventure that I’ll hardly forget. Life is Complicated, Life is Depressive, Life is Unfair, Life is... Strange. 10/10
Step 1: *lay down*
Step 2: try not to cry
Step 3: *cry because you can not turn back time to play the game again like you did the first time*

10/10 would feel again
1. Close your doors and do dark in your room
2. Take power generator (if somebody turn off the fuses) 
3. Shut down your phone and your family
4. Take your headphones
5 .Take to your pc so many tissues as you can
6. Finaly TURN ON LIFE IS STRANGE
7. Be ready for crying
8. After that all play - Syd Matters - Obstacles so many times as you can

+mega brutal story
+incredibly good soundtrack
+it make cry everybody
∞/10
Well... what to say... I have never experienced such a moving story in one game. It's so full of emotions, hard choices, smiles and tears... This is the game which fully deserves your time. "Life is Strange" will make you think about what true friendship really means.

Game designers have created one detailed experience, full of genuine moments which will touch your heart. I had tears in my eyes, and since I was a bully victim during my war-torn childhood I really had a hard time watching how some characters struggle. My identification with Kate was total.

This game is a true masterpiece. It's so natural, with strong sense.

You can't change your past and you shouldn't stress about that. Everything happens for a reason. Our goal is to learn something from our experiences and to make our microcosmos one pleasant place filled with love.

Life is Strange. And beautiful.

10/10
Life is Strange sat in my Steam library for a long time. Despite the recommendations from people with gaming opinions I trust, I was nervous that the game's teenage high school setting would be hard to relate to as an old fart and that I would find the game to be little more than a Dawson's Crack-esque 'I'll stare at a lake to solve all my problems' affair.

How wrong I was I was.

As soon as the calming and emotive main menu theme started I instantly relaxed and within a minute or two of  the main protagonist Max's company at the start of the game I knew I my fears were unwarranted. What followed was a beautifully paced story, told with real heart. Characters are introduced that initially appear to be one dimensional caricatures, but soon reveal themselves to be much deeper and rounded, making early decisions taken in the game much more complex than they initially seemed. I frequently found myself overthinking things as critical choices came up, second guessing the potential motives of nearly every character.

The soundtrack and visuals massively contribute to the atmosphere and several times I wished I could just wander around the town of Arcadia Bay soaking up the Autumnal Oregon setting. Coupled with the many references to films such as The Breakfast Club & Bladerunner, not to mention games like The Longest Journey series and Bioshock Infinite, I felt that this game was really pitched at me as an adult and not the younger audience that I thought it was aimed at.

There is no doubt that some people will bounce off the game, the character Chloe can be very diffiult to relate to initially and I can see that some people would dismiss the game very quickly as a result. For me however, the game got under my skin and after the inevitably tough climax I found myself thinking about the game for days afterwards, about  the story,  about the characters and the effect my choices had on them. The start of chapter four will stay with me forever as a powerful piece of storytelling I think, something that very few games I've enjoyed in the last thirty odd years have been able to achieve.

A beautiful example of intelligent interactive fiction, hella recommended.
I never write reviews - not even for games I love...

But this game.... God damn this game.
What. A. Masterpiece.

- The storytelling is some of the best I've ever seen in gaming,
- Every twist is impactful and has meaning,
- The art style is amazing,
- Great characters (and voice actors),
- Amazing sound and music

I cannot give this game enough praise.

Edit: Playing the prequel 'Before the Storm' helps you to relate to the characters even more and gives this game's story further impact. Also reccomended
my opinion reviwe 

Story 10/10
Gameplay 10/10
Graphics 10/10 

thank you for making this game 
really liked it 
one of best 
my favorite 
special thanks for all who made this great game 
best wishes

[h1] It's so beautiful. Damn. I instantly fell in Love with it and played every Episode and each per sit. 5 Sessions á 2-3,5 Hours. Worth it!! [/h1]

This game is a masterpiece. At the beginning, I thought it was just a kind of teen drama, based on the importance of friendship and on the story of a typical geek bullied at school. But it goes over.

First of all the less interesting part, the graphics, they are quite good but similar to those of a PS3 game, even though they improve a little in the last chapters. The Lip-Sync sometimes just stops working and aren't even moving even tho they're talking.

But the story is absolutely captivating and the plot depends highly on your choices during the whole game.
It's not just the story of a shy teenager who's attending a new school trying to make new friendships, there is a big mystery to solve about a disappeared girl and other important decisions to make, as the protagonist finds out to have a strong power: she can rewind time. 

[h1] YOU [/h1]  can choose when rewinding time, changing your decisions, your actions, your words. It makes the game more interesting and in the end there are just two crucial choices to take which really makes you feel bad. I appreciate the realistic dialogues, situations and troubles linked to her supernatural power.

I like the story because since the beginning it makes you feel anxious and you want always to know how it will end. I absolutely love also the theme songs during the game, especially in the chapters finals.
The gameplay, being an interactive drama, is quite basic, you just have to walk and press buttons when required. You definitely put yourself in the main character's shoes and this is what I loved the most in this amazing game, I think it is a masterpiece.

If you're in need of a Story-driven Movie / Game / Walking Simulator where choices matter - feel free to get it. It gets traded mostly for a few dollars MAX.

if you're in need of a FPS and a like GTA / Metro or whatever... you wont find you luck here. Its mostly a Movie you're watching / TellTale Game if that says more to you.

*RECOMMENDED*
*NOMINATED FOR AN AWARD*
Let me preface all of this by saying that I play a lot of games, and that I love adventure games. It’s probably my favorite genre, overall.

Why is that important? Because I have to scramble my brain to find any other examples of games that has captivated me so consistently and felt as evocative and powerful as Life is Strange. I can’t even pinpoint why, not exactly anyway. There’s plenty of weak points here, after all. The graphics are nothing to gawp at. The lip-synching is just awful. The story is interesting, but nothing stellar. Not to mention the puzzles, which are not challenging or even very creative. But I find myself ignoring all of that while playing, because the game just sucks me in. It’s one of those rare games that continue to affect me [i]hours[/i] after I’ve completed an episode. It’s not just me thinking about how I could have affected the choice-driven story differently either. It’s more a sense of wonder. It makes me nostalgic. This game makes me think about my own life. It makes me think about memories I treasure, moments I remember from my youth. I find myself drifting back and forth in my muddled thoughts, thinking how my teenage years were and how they formed me. Life is Strange makes me feel. Not just while playing, but long afterwards. Life truly, is strange. It really makes that statement ring.

Life is Strange then, is one of those games with [i]heart[/i]. It shows its qualities primarily through its characters; flawed and occationally inconsistent, but so relatable, quirky and interesting. Every person has layers upon layers to them, and they all feel important, even when they do nothing at all but sit there. They feel real. And they keep surprising both me and Max, the sweet protagonist.

The other definitive quality of this game is in its atmosphere. Arcadia Bay, like the characters there, feels like a real place. You just want to explore this world! The visuals and the sounds and music comes together to create a gloriously  calm and warm symphony of lush forests, homey houses and run-down diners. It’s a place that seems to have been lost in time, a small American town that we all could feel some belonging to, no matter what nationality you adhere to. The most inspiring moments in this game comes from just walking and soaking it all in. Or sitting, while Max shares her thoughts with you. It feels precious. It really does.

Oh, and did I mention it’s got a sweet time-control mechanic?

Now that’s just icing in the cake, though. 

[h1]TL; DR: Just play it, it's amazing![/h1]

[i]I tried to avoid spoilers in this review as much as possible![/i]

Life is Strange is an episodic story based and choice driven adventure game developed by Dontnod Entertainment (Remember Me) and published by Square Enix. In the game you play as an 18 year old girl Maxine (Max) Caulfield, a photography student, who returns after 5 years to her hometown Arcadia Bay to attend Blackwell Academy, a prestigious private school. After witnessing a tragic event in her school, she discovers she has the power to rewind time and prevents it…

[b]Story? Wowsers![/b]

Life is Strange is a coming of age story about a socially awkward teenage girl dealing with some (really!) heavy issues using her newly discovered power. You control Max through 3rd person perspective, interacting with people and objects. The gameplay is similar to other story driven games like the ones from TellTale Games (The Walking Dead, Wolf among us, Tales from the Borderlands,…) but with more freedom when exploring and dealing with choices, since you can rewind any decision if you are not too happy with its (short-term) consequence. Also there are no QTEs in this game. I’d rather not say too much about the story for fear of spoiling too much  of it, just that Life is Strange has one of the best stories I’ve ever experienced in a game, TV show, movie or a book!

[b]Graphics? Hella nice![/b]

I really love how this game looks! Nice lighting effects, character animation and movement, the beautiful landscape of the Arcadia Bay, the art in pictures and photographs. Even though there are some issues with lip-syncing and in one part of the game my Max didn’t even open her mouth when she spoke (I guess she also had the power of telepathy or maybe she was training to become a ventriloquist) I believe Dontnod did an amazing job here.

[b]Voice acting? Amazeballs![/b]

Hannah Telle (voice of Max) and Ashly Burch (voice of Max’s best friend Chloe) were incredible here. You can really feel the characters’ struggle, pain, love through their acting. I really love hearing Max contemplating every choice she makes in her head, makes you truly question if it was the right one. It comes as no surprise to me they won various awards for their performances in LiS. Kudos to other voice actors as well.

[b]Soundtrack? Ready for the mosh pit![/b]

Well… not really.  The original score, composed by Jonathan Morali, consists of mostly soft tunes played by acoustic instruments and it fits this game perfectly with additional songs by Syd Matters, The Foals, Amanda Palmer, Alt-J… Just wow! Be it songs or background music, it’s all so wonderfully integrated into the game and they really help set the mood. I often listen to the LiS soundtrack and even though several months have passed after finishing the game, I still get the feels just by hearing some of these magnificent songs! Ahhh…

Life is Strange will heavily play on your heartstrings and chew up emotions you didn’t even realize you had, but in the end you will be glad you experienced this amazing journey. One of the best games, I’ve ever played!
It is extremely rare to experience a game which can evoke such a strong emotional response to the player. I don't believe I have actually shed any tears from a video game before but I'm glad [h1] Life is Strange[/h1] managed to make an adult man stare blankly at his screen for what seemed like hours, all to just push a single button, with tears rolling down his cheek.

Life is Strange has hundreds of thousands of positive reviews and critical acclaim from gamers and critics alike and I feel like mine might be entirely pointless in the grand scheme of things but I wanted to express how much this game, these digital characters, their stories and emotions, their thoughts and fears and vices, how they all contributed into creating one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had the privilege to have.

For the record, I'm a sucker for interactive story based games like Telltale [i]used to [/i] make and for better or for worse I'm gonna make a few comparisons between them and Life is Strange.
So if you're familiar with the genre you're essentially thrust in a sort of 'choose your own adventure' book only this time you can't skip the page ahead and see where that takes you. Well with so many videos and walkthroughs online you [b] can[/b] but that's not the point of the game. 

You're in control of Max Caulfield, a 12th grade student in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay in Oregon, and without going into spoilers, you're about to embark on a great adventure, a [u]coming of age[/u] type of story filled with many themes which teenagers, young adults and even older people can and will relate to regardless of their background,

Gameplay wise, you have the power to [i]rewind[/i] time which allows you to change something that happened or you said to someone and to help people around the town. There's a couple of puzzles spread throughout each of the episodes but for the most part they're incredibly easy to figure out and they shouldn't be an issue for anyone. Doing something, or saying something will have an impact on the outcome in some aspects of the game but of course not everything weighs the same. 

There's a very long debate to be had regarding the [b]illusion of choice[/b], that is to say that while the player thinks they have the freedom to significantly alter the course of the games' story, in reality they are being tricked by the game which essentially will lead to a few specific scenarios without too much differentiation regardless of the players actions.

To a certain degree, most of the latest Telltale games are guilty of that sin and to be honest, Life is Strange does that too but to a lesser extent. However this does not take away anything from the overall theme and power that the story in Life is Strange has to offer. While there are a few 'illusionary' moments in the game and while some choices are for the sake of what would seem mundane matters, Life is Strange will captivate the player in the character development and story progression.

When I started playing the game I was a little bit annoyed. I felt like an old man, yelling at kids to get out of his lawn. What are these teenagers doing? With their drugs, their parties, the backstabbing bitches, social media matters, the high school drama. I felt getting irritated by their behavior but then it hit me... I was getting emotionally invested in these characters. I was actually participating in their lives, I actually cared about what was happening. Now that's a sign that the developers had done something very right.

The story is one of the best I've ever experienced in a video game, in particular an interactive adventure type one like Telltale games; honestly I would say it ranks amongst my top 5 in any game ever. There's a perfect mixture of supernatural, seriousness, humour, action and so much more.

There're plenty of themes that are explored in the game and there's absolutely something to heavily relate to which makes for an even more impressive way to have the player become engrossed in the game. You have lots of relationship themes, the game in my opinion is a tale about friendship and love, you can explore aspects of redemption, or fall from grace, of betrayal, parenthood... Seriously, the game has absolutely everything to offer to the player. Even more adult themes like sexuality and drugs are given ample time and they're never preachy, oppressive and are always done in a mature and tasteful manner. To see a game explore said themes without insulting the player is actually a breath of fresh air. 

There's plenty of subtle stuff, but that's up to the player to draw their own conclusions based on their own experiences and the choices you'll have to make through the different episodes which will make you think hard before selecting an answer. Furthermore if you regret on a decision, you can rewind and choose another one! This core gameplay mechanic adds a needed amount of complexity to an already simplistic genre and I can only praise the developers for including that and having it intertwined with the story.

And lastly, the characters are imperfectly perfect. The people you will meet through your journey will feel like real people and not some pixels on the screen. The voice acting and mannerisms are one of the best I've ever seen in a game and they will elevate the story on whole different level. Max, the main character, is the most adorable, kind, considerate, strong young woman, I've ever had the pleasure to play as in a video game. She's not a sex object, she's not a supersoldier, she is a person whose inner strength (should you choose to harness it of course) is so powerful that she can shape the people and [b]even the world[/b] around her... but that's for you to discover.

While I'm praising the game I also have to mention some of the lesser aspects of Life is Strange that while they don't take away anything from the brilliance that surrounds the game, they do look like sort of sore spot when compared to other games. First of all, the facial animations are mediocre at the best of times and outright bad on others. Because of the emotional state of the characters and the game itself, it is a bad reflection on the otherwise marvelous voice acting and emotions the characters convey with the colour of their voice. The models are pretty OK but the lip syncing and facial animations are lackluster. And while Telltale early games were marginally better, they managed to up their game later and since Life is Strange is a 2015 game, the same year when [b]Tales from the Borderlands[/b] released (comparing the best Telltale game here), I can sadly say that there could have been a lot more done on that department. That was the only significant flaw I found with game, besides the simplicity of some of the puzzles as well but that's less relevant overall in my opinion.


Life is Strange is a game I would consider art. The game's characters and story cannot be praised enough and I believe everyone should play this game. I'm trying to imagine it as a very successful TV show but I believe most of the messages and themes the game explores would be lost on the TV. While playing the game, simultaneously as yourself and Max you will fall in love with characters, you will hate others, you will experience things on and beyond the typical young adult lifestyle and during the final episodes you will tear up, maybe just a little but enough to know what you experience goes way beyond the monetary cost of the game. This game is a perfect example of how video games can expand beyond their shell and become works of art. Life is... weird. If you're gonna play an interactive story game ever in your life, make sure is this one. I cannot recommend it highly enough, an absolute masterpiece.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

I don't usually write reviews, so when I do, the game is either sh*t or amazing.
And Life is Strange is simply amazing in every aspect.

It has amazing storyline with good plot twists. 
Character development is on point. You may even get attached to some of the characters.
The music/sound track has to be one of the strong key elements of this game. Fits very well with game and makes the moments very emotional, yet enjoyable. I would even give a rating of 10 for just the music.

Definitely one of the best games I have ever played. Wish I could unplay this game and replay it as if I never played it before, just to enjoy the game again as a new experience.

A solid 10 out of 10.

EDIT: Also deserves "The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award for Steam Awards.
Best sensitive game ever. Kills all the negative that is in your heart (The game literally makes you human)))  
Thanks devs for all emotions :)  
10/10

Are there people who didn't cry in this game?
Episode 1 : 'wow this looks nice, maybe i'll play the other episodes one day'
Episode 2 : ' :D awesome'
Episode 3 : ' wut '
Episode 4 : ' OH FUUKK D:::::::::: '
Episode 5 : ' [b] crying in the corner of my room	[/b] '

I thought I was ready for anything. Welp I wasn't.

An unforgettable experience to which everyone should play.
1- finish the game...
2- enjoy the game.
3- hire a mage who is able to erase your memory.
4- back to 1 :)

11/10 would make algorithm again.
-Waiting for Life is Strange 2


My words can't describe how perfect this game is.
Let me correct that first line... it's not a game, that's a life changing experience.
It's a storytelling masterpiece, that sucks you in from start to finish.
It grabs your attention from the first moment and succeeds in keeping it until the closing credits.

You will feel so close to the characters and they become part of your life.
Every decision you make has consequences. 
In some sense it might be more about the choices you didn't make.
It's an emotional roller coaster with many plot twists.

I like Telltale games because of their story and the power to pull you in and care for the characters.
But this game goes beyond everything and is so much more polished and goes so much deeper.

The atmosphere is incredible and the style is so unique and extremely detailed.
It makes the game feel so realistic.
The characters were so memorable. That even long after I finished this I'm still thinking about them.

A truly unforgettable experience and I would do anything to experience it again like the first time. ♥
Wow. I've played dozens of games but I have to admit, I've never had as much emotional attachment to any of them as I did with Life is Strange. Damn you, DONTNOD. You've made me feel again. 

+ Nice graphics
+ Dialogs
+ Rewind time
+ Sound Quality
+ Shocking Endings of episode 3 - 4
+ Hardest decision at end EP - 5

- Nothing found

Keep good work DONTNOD.
This game deserve Golden Joystick or (Game of the year)
[h1]Beware![/h1] This game will make a part of your heart feel empty. You will always want to forget about the game and start as a whole brand new game or maybe go back in time when u started the game. You will grow quite attached to the characters and the bond with them. Every part of the story is flawless, maybe because i have emotionally attached to the game. Every choice you make whether it is major or minor, you will keep on thinking about it. Don't judge the game just by the first episode as it is free now, there is a lot more in the game. I highly recommend this game not only as a gamer but also as a person. This game will teach you to value things in your life and cherish every moment you spend, to live your life to the fullest. 

[b]10/10 : Highly recommended[/b] [i]the plot, the characters, the music, everything is epic.[/i] 

[i]Spoilers Ahead
I still regret choosing [spoiler]Arcadia Bay over Chloe[/spoiler] in the end, but you can't defy fate, there are things that are meant to happen. And if you go for the alternate ending which i surely wanted to see after the game ended, [spoiler]it is still not sure if Chloe will be safe in future[/spoiler], after all [b]"Destiny is a Fickle Bitch"[/b].[/i]

[b]EDIT : Nominated for "The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award"[/b]
In my opinion, this is the best video game in this genre.
Awesome story with a deep idea, art style, and icons, simply an experience you'll never forget.

.
 10/10
Every 5-10 years a game seems to come along with a special something, A little piece of magic that makes its a unforgettable experience. 

Life is Strange is one of those games. Not since Mass Effect 1 has a game captured this special magic. Before that Ocarina of Time.

The very fact I'm mentioning Life is Strange in the same review as Ocarina of Time should give you some idea as to how highly I rate this game.

Everyone will relate to the story in some way, and if you aren't moved emotionally in any way by this game you probably don't have a soul.

It will take sometime before I get over this game, it has really touched me, the saddest thing of all is that I won't be able to experience it again for the first time.

10/10 Game of the decade 2010-2020
Well well well... this game...woah...

This like, makes you smile, cry, scream and want to punch your screen.
The story is just so unique and so eventful.
You are basically watching a film where you chose what happens and when it happens.
The plot twists are just unbelieveable
and i personally found the ending cruel for my heart.

However I had such a great character bond with 'Chloe' and 'Kate' 

they were my favs! 


PLEASE PLAY THIS PURE BEAUTY!
It was so sad and hard to say good bye to this game, after all thos houers with laughting, crying, hate, smilling and nervousness... 

I have never played a game with a story line like this, and you get so much connection to the characters. 
I loved every minut of the game and will for sure play it again to chouse other opsions! 
The music, graffics, voice actors, story, gameplay, characters... everything fits so nice togheter and create a such a good game! 
Have to be my fav game of 2018! <3 

highly recommended!
This sums up my experience while playing this game.

Eps 1 : Not Bad
Eps 2 : Good
Eps 3 : Holy Moly
Eps 4 : What the hack??
Eps 5 : Are you sereal?????

Game must play in your life.
I guess my review will drown in others, but nevermind. It's game you play once, and it stays in you head for... like I know? I've finished it 6 months ago. Everytime when I think about it or look at screenshots I've made it gives me that feeling which I can't even describe with words. Worth the full price.
I'm way late to the party, and I played this game well after having spoiled for myself the plot and twists and so on (hard to avoid the talk over the years, and it was actually Eurogamer's Let's Play videos of this series that made me want to play it myself). That didn't seem to make playing it for my self any less of an emotional gut-punch. Dontnod nailed it, and this game is a beautiful work of art full of amazing visuals, great characters, fantastic voice acting, perfect music, and a deep meaningful story. 

I recommend having someone or something nearby to hug after playing this game. You're probably going to need it.
Imagine a universe where alternate realities exist. Now associate that with your life events. How far would you go to travel between parallel timelines so that you can save and savour that one moment you can never let go. The life event that defines who you are. Maybe family and friends. Maybe secrets that you wanna hold back. As Maxine Caulfield, a tender teenage girl who aspires to follow in the footsteps of the renowned Mr. Jefferson of photography art, you will face tough decisions as you uncover mistery of the serial killer that has haunted and amused everyone at the Blackwell Academy school.

Would you take the matter of life and death into your own hands? Would you play God? What's the price? For Caulfield, little does she know that destiny has a far more retched plan as she meddles with time. She confides her super power in her best childhood friend, Chloe. At first, it seems fun proving it to her and amusing her by predicting future events. Maybe even going rogue around Arcadia Bay (the story is set around this place) to such lengths as breaking into the principal's office and tracking down the drug ring (and the serial killer).

The story follows Maxine's and Chloe's adventures of fun and frolic. The two are inseparable detective freaks. Oblivious to Maxine, the impending disaster to Arcadia Bay will test her 'time' and bring her back to that one most precious moment, the most important of all, the final destination, the butterfly moment, the 'Butterfly Effect'. Torn between emotions and rage, Maxine must 'fix' everything she has sacrificed her power for and save Arcadia Bay from the disaster that is. But what would it mean for her best friend Chloe? What would it mean for her photography fame and career under Mr. Jefferson? What would it mean to live and die?

This was one hell of a rollercoaster ride! Be prepared to cry. Be prepared to feel desperate. Be prepared to be the incredible Maxine Caulfield!

I would easily give it a freaking 10/10.
Life is Strange taught me a lesson: we have to learn how to cope with the pain of loss instead of running from it. 
I got so emotional playing this game, i have no words to describe it. A real masterpiece.
For those who haven't played Life is Strange yet, I highly recommend playing it. + It's cheap, it should be a crime.

[spoiler] BAE > BAY (Arcadia Bay) [\spoiler]
+ The story and the atmosphere is really great!
+ All the characters are deeply built and the voice acting is top-notch, especially Max and Chloe really grow up and change after each day (episode)!
+ AMAZING SOUNDTRACK! I can't stress this enough, it's just perfect, every freaking music sequence is just perfect!
+ Almost everything you do can impact the future, present and past!
+ If you feel like a completionist you can play 'Collector Mode' after playing the episode to take the photos you've missed for the achievements
+ Graphics are really great and it's simply beautiful to play and watch

[h1]Overall - 9.5/10 [/h1]
Step 1 – get episode 1 for free.
Step 2 – slowly get hooked.
Step 3 - buy the other episodes.
Step 4 – master time and become a time lord…
Step 5 – realized that you in love with a girl named Chloe
Step 6 – chose between crying yourself to sleep at night or using your time lord powers to never play this game again…

Overall… game was amazing, and it’s a must finish game to understand how great it is.

[h1]"I wish I could stay in this moment forever. But then it wouldn't be a moment."[/h1]
Life is Strange is my favourite game of all time. I could go on about this game and it's characters for the rest of my life. 
I love every moment of it. Every step I take as Max, every second I spend in Arcadia Bay makes me happy even when it's sad, connects me to characters who transcend fiction for me, takes me to another world real enough that I wish I could exist in for real. 
Life is Strange changed my life - Life is Strange saved my life. I think about it every day since I first played it back in July 2017 on the PS4. The contents of the game, the characters, are all too real for me, and they've helped me through a lot of stuff, are still helping me through stuff. If I'm having a bad day, pretty much anything Life is Strange makes me feel better. 
To anyone who hasn't played this game, this probably all sounds crazy. But there's something at the core of this game that transcends easy definition. There's a real human soul to this game that allows me to connect to it like no other art that I've ever experienced. On the surface, it's a choice-based adventure game. But if you're like me, after just five minutes you sense that there's something different about this game. From the calming soundtrack to the beautiful art style, Life is Strange is a fully absorbing experience. 
So, I could definitely go on forever. I could pour countless words into the review and not be able to fully express just what Life is Strange represents to me. It saved my life. The hella awesome fandom and all the hella great people still creating content makes the game a lot deeper for me as well, but it's just icing on the cake on the most important game I've ever played in my life. I could go on, about how Max and Chloe are my personal heroes, about how I wear a replica of Chloe's necklace everyday, about how I discovered whole new genres of music, about how I learned how to see life in a better light, about how the excellent characterisation shatters stereotypes and caricatures, about the earnest, emotional themes that it discusses, about the utter bastard who is the main antagonist, but if I did, we'd be here all day (not that that'd be a problem for me!). 
So, I love this game. It's my favourite game of all time, and I imagine it will remain that way for the rest of my life. Somehow that almost doesn't feel like I'm doing it justice. It transcends words, for me. I recommend this game with every fibre of my being. I can see that it has faults, for sure - the dialogue can sometimes be a little weird, the puzzles are rarely challenging - but I still love it more than any other artistic experience I've had. 
To anyone who decides to play it for the first time... enjoy. Savour it. It's not every day you get to experience a masterpiece for the first time.
That's not a game, that's a life changing experience.
Buy this game and play it with you're heart, because this will change your feelings for the rest of your life, trust me. A rollercoaster of emotions, amazing characters, a soundtrack that will give you chills and a story that you will never forget. What can I say without spoiling something? Just buy the game, you will never regret it.
♥ [i]Currently i am stuck on you, and you will be my favorite story for a long time. I don't even want to call you as a game, just because you made me cry, laugh, shock, scare, excited while i am just sitting on a chair! It was really huge experience and i feel really glad for being part of this.[/i] ♥
Wowser. A story-telling masterpiece, from start to finish. Unbelievably well-written and smartly executed, Life is Strange will pull you into its incredibly gripping tale. Like a good book or TV series, you will not want to put it down. Not since The Last Of Us or The WItcher 3 have I experienced something that has sparked such an emotional response. Be warned, this is an 18+ game, and it will touch upon themes that will make you feel uncomfortable, sick, happy, sad, hateful. It puts Telltale games to shame. You will look at the store page and probably think this is just another teenage drama walking simulator, but it's so much more than that. It takes time to pick up the pace, but like any good story, it needs to build up its events leading to its inevitable conclusion. It manages to craft a deep story with layered characters to near perfection. Life is Strange proves again that the videogame industry can push the boundaries of story-telling even further. 
   
If this is not enough to get you to buy the game, the gameplay involves you solving numerous puzzles using a time mechanic, but that's all I can say without spoiling one of the best aspects of Life is Strange. The puzzles are very unique and challenging, but never unfair. Graphics are ok, considering the art-style is a kind of water-colored paint. Playing this game feels like walking through an art museum.
    
 In short, give this game a try. If you like a good story, you will not regret this. It's mature themes might hit you personally, but it will surely make you think about your life and the people around you. No game has ever made me cry, but this one came so damn close. 

[i] Everybody cares until they don't. [/i]
This game is a masterpiece. It's the adventure game I always wanted to play without even realising it. It does use come clichés and the animation isn't perfect - but everything else pretty much is. From voice acting, to the story, to mechanics, to soundtrack - it goes right to your heart and stays there.

Also there's no excuse not to play it, because episode 1 is free. Just try. 

A final word of advice: the less you know before you dive in, the better. Might be a bit too late if you're reading this review, but just stop here and play it!
i doubt there will be any story that will be ever able to beat this.
I really felt empty when i finished the game, i hope i could reset my memory to play this again
A beautiful masterpiece that i will never forget
I'm a little late to the party, but I see a lot of people saying that they can't explain why Life is Strange is good, or they can't without spoilers. Some reviews I think just focus directly on the wrong aspects of the game, mostly the time powers, the part that draws you in and makes the story but not the reason why this game hits so many people emotionally.

The soundtrack was amazing, the story was consistent and kept the kind of continuity you don't find in other stories, despite others saying they couldn't follow it(it was back and forth a lot, but that made it great in my opinion). But the real reason this game is great is because it's a game.

If Life is Strange was a movie, I think it would hit, but more like a soft thump that makes you feel bad, but it would be too short, feel edgy, and it wouldn't have the chokehold on your heartstrings that the game has. In Life is Strange... you're attached, you are Max Caulfield, and this is happening to you. You decide what to do, and for a game that lets you go back in time, it really shows how fragile choices in life are and what they can mean. And when you can just fix everything all of the time... when you can't, it becomes that much worse. You feel so out of control, you just want to rip your eyes out and cry at the same time.

I won't spoil too much, but there is a moment when you lose your powers for a moment. And in that moment, you have to do something very important. Personally, I failed. I failed and I almost cried, not in the moment but after the fact, because I realized after everything that happened, this wasn't something I could change. In another moment, you're trapped. You can't move, and all you can do is keep going back and trying to do what few options you have. And you just keep going back, not just a few seconds, but all the way back, and you think you can change it, but things get convoluted and hard to follow, and every single tiny action you do can change everything. And they do.

Life is Strange isn't about any single story, it's about Arcadia Bay, and yes, there's a focus on Max Caulfield and Chloe Price, but you also care about the side characters in some way, because they aren't empty husks. They're fleshed out people with feelings, and are deeper than face value. This is a long game, and if you take the time to explore everything, you will see a side that no movie or even book could ever show. Life is Strange capitalized on everything it had, and it did it well. It turned what started as an edgy teen high school story into something not just mature, but something that can stand alone as genre defining. From now on, when I think back to the best drama I've ever watched, it won't be a movie, it will be this.
This game is amazing. It gave me a childhood I never had and let me feel love I hadn't felt before. I moved past a lot that's happened to me while playing. I didn't have a great childhood, and didn't have a real connection with many people or a best friend like this. Life is Strange helped me let go of all that, and gave me a motivation to live: one day, I'll have a friendship like Max and Chloe's. Thank you for creating this beautiful art. I'm glad I lived through it, and I'm a stronger girl now than I ever was. Thank you 💖
i 100% this game and totally love every moment . Except for that last achievement so freaking  hard. But you can consider it as a challenge cause this game is too ez . Also it fully support controller and i love game which is fully supported for controller
Wonderful game. Must be one of the best I've ever played. Soooo good! 
It's very heartbreaking though I cried quite a 'bit. First video game to actually make me cry... It's hella sad. Wowser.
I could gush about Life Is Strange a lot, but I fear that might be counter-productive, so I'll keep it succinct and spoiler-light. LIS is a story-driven adventure game that wants to make you care. Where others aim to tickle your adrenaline glands, this one wants to engage your tear glands; it's a game that works at warming your heart, not venting your spleen. There are no guarantees it will succeed in working its magic on you, of course - but I found it to be a very charming and sincere tale about teenagers dealing with their bullying peers, unsympathetic adults, and various mysteries. If that sounds like it might be your cup of tea, you should probably give the free Episode 1 a whirl! It's a slow-paced start, but if you find yourself entertained by it, the subsequent four episodes should please you greatly.
Life is Strange is a well-rounded, emotionally-impacting interactive video game placing the player in the shoes of Max Caulfield, an 18-year-old photographer who gains the ability to travel back in time (i.e. undo a choice to see another outcome before making your final decision... the rest of her powers is a spoiler). The 5-five story explores themes of choice and consequence, moral decision, and features several key moments where Max's actions will influence the game as a whole. Life is Strange is one of my favourite games for these reasons; I enjoy a game where I can see the impact of player choice coming into effect, and emotional (manipulation) storytelling - done right in this instance - is always excellent.

I highly recommend Life is Strange to everyone who hasn't experienced an interactive video game. Much like Detroit: Become Human and Tales from the Borderlands, LiS does a fantastic job at seeing choices matter, and involving the player as a key component... it's not just A to B.
Um... no words right now.... every time I try to think of something to say I can't. This game blew me away! The only thing I can say is I 100% recommend this game!!
Wonderful!! Such a beautiful experience. 12/10 would buy a new brain to experience this game whole new again. Please avoid any spoiler while you're at this and please, please just try this game out. remember, chapter 1 is free!!!
This is the only steam review I've ever done or likely will do... because I honestly think this is the best game I've ever played.

Admittedly it took me a couple of tries to "get into it", but once you get to the end of episode 1 it's almost impossible to put down.

Now I'm going to play it again, then get the prequel.
When the first time it released i already feel that this game will succeed and imo, Life is strange is one the best story games out there hands down. i really enjoyed the story line and the choices that you have to make carefully. Life is strange describes how the reality is and the people there wants us to notice it and be strong. 

Anyway, cant wait for Life is strange 2 episodes.
10/10

Life is Strange teaches us many things.

Life is Life, and its hella strange, as the name says. We all make wrong decisions in it, we all make right decisions in it. And the game is real, not like the others. Because ALL of the characters have a defect. 

Max ~ Too Shy.
Chloe ~ Anxiety.
Nathan ~ Too Violent.
Victoria ~ Regret.
Kate ~ Depression.

And more.

But well, it teaches us about many things. Such as love, friendship, suicide...
The game is a bit hated because people say it has too many LGBT things but I dont give two fucks what they say. We can all choose our own sexuality. We can all rule our lives.

Freedom has no price, nobody should take it for granted if they have it, it has so much fucking value, I never had it when I was a kid so thats why I have a part of some defects the characters in the game already have.

It also teaches us about losing someone we loved. Like Chloe lost her father and Rachel. Or how Max sacrifices Chloe and loses her. (In the game when I first played it chose Chloe over Arcadia bay obviously)

We all have such small, and sad lives. Can't we just...accept our fate and start socializing?-(still hard for me to do but here goes nothing) Let's make other people's life better!

I could spend so much talking about how much I love the game. How much I couldve had the same style exactly like Chloes when I was a teenager, but its never too late to dye your hair blue right ? How much I admire and envy the relationship between Chloe and Max, I feel bad sometimes for not having a Max in my life but at the end of the day, who gives a shit.

Anyways, I love that game, and I always fucking will. Its made me very emotional and I wasnt ready for that at all. 

Thank you S. for this beautiful birthday gift, I can easily say it was my best birthday, if I could rewind time once just to the moment I met you, no pun intended.
This isnt a game, this is art. Thank you DONTNOD, thank you SQUARE ENIX.
Such a good game. I loved it to bits when I played it. A bit disappointed that all my choices led to the same outcomes, but that final choice, oh man. Such a compelling story that I loved, and had that perfect sci-fi mix with the normal life that just made me love this game so much. Highly recommend if you love games that got superpowers and good plot. And of course, a bit of romance.
Life is Strange is an interesting experience that I somewhat enjoyed. I recommend this game, though not highly as some of the writing and dialogue can be a bit predictable, lackluster, and unintentionally funny. If you enjoy dramatic single-player stories, I recommend you check it out. Otherwise you probably already know how you'll feel about it, you don't really need my recommendation.
If you're into 'choose your own adventure' book, you'll probably be into this. If you enjoyed Russian Doll, or Run Lola Run - give this game a try. It definitely f***ed me up, there were a ton of harsh choices and a lot of stuff you have to do ends up neither fully black or fully white when it comes to rigid morality. You'll be swimming in shades of grey, with a healthy splatter of blood throughout. A warning for anyone sensitive to gore: this game doesn't go overboard with blood, but the themes which cause the blood - just be prepared to talk to somebody if you're feeling down. Life is Strange lives up to it's name, it isn't called 'Life is Happy' for a reason. I binged this game in 15 hours and feel like a wrung-out sponge.
Step by step guide on how to play:
1. Lie down
2. Try not to cry 
3. Cry a lot 
4. Profit 

All jokes aside, this game left me emotionally devastated. 
Hands down one of the best games i've ever played.
10/10
me: oh cool, I can water my plant, thats a cute little detail they added haha

game: "This action will have consequences."

11/10 realistic garden simulator.
This game is absolutely mindblowing. The amount of emotion that was captivated during my playthroughs was beyond intense. I have never been so emotionally attached to characters in any movie, tv show, or other game than I was with this amazing first season. Ready your tissues and headphones, this is quite a story.
[b]After playing Life is Strange, I found myself became so emotional about my future. This game is more than just A Game. It is Life. A Game that actually telling the meaning of life and portraying the problems we must face in our lives realistically. I sincerely hope that this game can be remake into a movie. Let more people in the world truly understand the issues that life needs to learn.[/b]

A Game will Change your Life[/h1]
TL/DR Buy this game, experience it, have a box of tissues handy, you will need them.


As I write this review, it is 4:30 in the morning, I just finished all 5 episodes over the course of a weekend. What can I really say about this game, and I use the term game lightly, it is more of a finding yourself experience. I have never cried so much over a video game, the choices you are forced to make.....they make you take a step back and think "Could I make these kind of choices if I had to?" Life is Strange will play on every emotion you have, you will cry, you will be furious, you will say out loud "what the fuck?" I have never played a game so complex, that even the simplest of decisions will affect the final outcome. I bought this on sale, and I feel like I ripped the developers off cause I didn't pay full price. The art style, the music, the emotions, the life choices, Life is Strange is easily one of the greatest experiences in video game, and storyboard writing ever created. Just under 13 hours on my first play through, and I was never board for a second, I'm gonna need a day or two to rest my emotions after this, but I will be going back many times to see how my decisions affect the final outcome. I love this game, if I was told that I could only play one game for the rest of my life, I would choose this one.
Aaaa The Story So Ritch , one of the best Visual Novel Type games i ever played, still working through episode 4 but i can see where is this going.
theres some rewind bug that makes me pissed off though, but still hella of a game
Recomend this game, make me regret why i havent played the game erlier.

I had heard about his game from online and a number of my friends and wow...definitely one of the best games I've played recently. Can't wait to get started on number 2
I stole from the people who made this game, I literally stole from them. With regional pricing + Steam sale I payed like $2.75 for all chapters, for quite possibly the best visual novel I've ever played.
6.8/10 *spoiler* *spoiler**spoiler**spoiler**spoiler*



whatever decision you make in game the game forces you to choose between two in the final scene. so they don't really matter that much.
This game I will recommend to anyone that wants to experience a good story. It has a heavy butterfly feeling to it and I really liked that. Overall the game was made very good, I love storys like these. but that is my opinion. whether you like the game depends on if you like games where you slowly unfold the story, your actions have consequences.
Great game and plot. Just go and play it.

















p.s.
I freaking cried at lesson the next day I finished the game, I am really depressed about the choices I made.
Absolutely phenomenal. Never have I played a game that seamlessly throws you into a world so truly immersive and magical. The way the music exemplifies this is beyond compare, with me being unable to hold back the tears on more than one occasion. The world it creates is just simply unmatched, which forces you to want to be part of it. This is the first game I have ever played of this genre, so I may come off as a little biased, but I wholeheartedly believe you will never be able to find another game that offers the same experience.
That was a fantastic experience, this is a classic Telltale Game done wright. Original IP? Check. Consequences to your actions? Check. Different endings? Check. Why are you even reading this? We both know that if you have the slightest interest in a choice based story game, yo're going to love this one.
I´ve known this game for a long time and after a good friend of mine gifted it to me, I could relive the LiS universe again. It´s really admiring how the creators were abe to put the player onto an emotional rollercoaster. This game has a really good story, amazing characters, who you hate and love a lot and it addresses realistic topics, which you as a player most likely connect yourself with. It´s all about confidence in yourself, friendship and courage. It´s not too emotional and not too serious. Just about the right amount of everything. Can´t wait to play more games! And for those who are going to play it: Lean back, listen to the bgm and enjoy the story that you will form through your choices ;)
Best game i have ever played. It sucks you into the story, and it actually has a good mix of different characters. It is exhilarating, funny, good pace, and also heartbreaking. I cried at the end, and i am shook. Thanks for making such a great game! <3
What can I say about Life is Strange. It's an extremely heartfelt and emotional game, it feature an amazing setting and an even better cast of characters. All episode are amazing however i would say episode 4 is the weakest however it's still an excellent episode. All the characters are relatable and very easy to sympathise with.

My only criticisms are that the graphics are pretty lacking and the lip syncing is awful. 

9/10 would pay full price.
After i complete the game, now i can say that this game was so beautiful, it has a great story with a best ending every episode that makes me sad/happy? LOL. 

10/10
Would play again
None of your choices matter, and most of the Characters are insufferable dickbags, I hate everyone in this game especially Chloe, she's just an annoying narcissistic bitch who expects everything to go her way and just uses people, plot makes no sense and nothing flows together.
I haven't finished it, but already felt tired. 
A friend is a huge fan of it and recommended to me, but this is really not my style. I like choice-matter games, but I feel none of the choices is what I would actually do in real life. The choices are a bit too limited from my perspective, and the main character experiences so much trouble just for the sake of story design.
I don't enjoy being a headache to everyone around me, not even in games. I guess it's a good one for people who would like to play tricks on other characters in games. It has pretty good graphics, sound & music & voice over. A bit difficult to interact, but still a nicely done game.
Played all of the masterpieces of David Cage, LiS is like Garbage compares to them. A child's play, no matter you choose you can get back to correct them or not effective at all cause game force to go back and no one remember that you take a dump in their toilet and didn't flush. 6/10. oh, and no skippable dialog (mostly) for you!
I was starting to enjoy the story then the game crashed my PC, I wasn't even able to power off my pc so i had to unplug the power to my computer. I tried the game again and it crashed my PC again after about 10mins. It could possible be my graphics card overloading from the very high anti aliasing settings but i doubt that as my PC is way over the recommended specs so my graphics card shouldn't be struggling at all. It also can't be my PC over heating as i had my AC set to 18 degrees Celsius. If the devs could fix the bugs in the game i will change this review.
literal trash as far as im concerned pretends to be about choice but they're all virtually inconsequential, just illusion of choice most of the time for instance chloe a character in the game asks "were you there" option 1 "i was there" option 2 "i wasnt there" choose option 2 to which she says you're lying and you then proceed to say "okay i was there". 
like dont give me the f*cking option if you're just going to do the opposite anyway... I find it infuriating when games pull this bs and they will push whatever narrative they want despite your choices.... 
and man! dont even get me started on the level of eye rolling and irritation produced by these 
nauseating characters, most of the time i wish they would just add the option for you to tell them all to shut their whiny a*ses the f*ck up and then have the protagonist do the same cos man is the dialogue cringy....besides from these things,at its core its all just walking simulator with a load of mostly irrelevant crap for you to interact with.

soooo this game if you cant tell was not for me ill leave this one for the presumably teenage girls who might possibly relate to any of this rubbish, also all the bits that attempt to deal with serious issues is totally stifled and saturated in teen angst and cringy whining, its clear i am not amongst the demographic in which it seems to be aimed at.

i will say however that some of the music was very well done, loved some of the music but i have lost all interest in playing this now ill just keep it to sit at the menu and hear the beautiful theme that plays in the background.
overrated as fuck, has a weird story with a lot of plot holes, plot twists seem too forced and some unexplained unnatural stuff in the game turns me off. Dialog is extremely cringey too. 

If you actually want to enjoy a breathtaking story game and don't mind a bit of hack n slash, try NieR:Automata
This game is not for me, i didn't like it. It is not a game, it is like an interactive movie..
After uninstalling it i wonder the scenario and watched the youtube videos, the scenario may be nice, but as i sad it is like a teenager movie, i didn't get the point in the high rating of this game.
[h1] ONE OF THE WORST CHOICES MATTER ADVENTURE GAMES OF HISTORY OF GAMING	[/h1]

This game really had potential in my eyes when i first saw the trailer of this game. The concept of this game is simple but if the company uses this concept right, they could create a masterpiece. But when they were creating this game, they probably wrote the story when they were taking a late night shit in the bathroom.

The story starts actually pretty good. The concept is also fine in paper but in action, the story is horrible.

How could you screw up a concept, which is based on a girl who can rewind the time to change her life, other people's lives, and also the fate of a town which will be destroyed by a storm in the future? This game is a teenager game and this game is for the people who doesn't know (and probably will never know if they keep playing these overrated games) what a good story should be. The story is shit, choices does not even matter except the few last decisions at the end, which is stupid for a FUCKING CHOICES MATTER ADVENTURE GAME! You can only rarely emphaty with characters.

This game is overrated as fuck, most of the gamers are thinking that this game is better than any Telltale games. If you see these kind of people, just remove them from your entire life so you won't get cancer for a stupid reason.

Play Telltale Games (R.I.P) masterpieces instead of this bullshit. Everything about this game is embarrassing as fuck.

[h1] Pros:	[/h1]

+Graphics are actually decent
+Musics are awesome
+A great concept on paper

[h1] Cons:	[/h1]

-But horrible concept/story in action
-Characters are literally soulless but the game tricks you to think they actually have soul
-%98 of the choices are pointless, they do not even matter in this game
-A teenager game
-The fanbase of this game who thinks this game is the best game of all time. Don't tell me the "Everyone can have their own opinion" gibberish. If you think this game is a masterpiece, you probably have brain tumor.
-Overrated
-This game is for the people who doesn't know what a real adventure game is.

[h1] I HAVE THE LIMITED EDITION PHYSICAL COPY OF THIS GAME FOR PS4 AND I FINISHED THIS GAME COUPLE OF TIMES	[/h1]
You don't have the choice of your suspects ,and if  I had had the choice , I would have finished the game like a King JUST WITH MY OVERPOWERED INSTINCT, DAMN IT.
This review is for the full game

I think this game did some things well, but was ultimately extremely disappointing. Gameplay seemed well polished, graphics were "cartoony" but decent looking for the period it was released, and the "detective" style proactive gameplay is appealing to me. 

My beef is solely regarding the writing. What really frustrated me was the ignorance and bigotry of the writing staff showing in the story. Characters in the story who claim to value science and are purportedly good at it are constantly making grand and unreasonable assumptions regarding phenomena they have very little information about, and in several instances making claims based on faith alone. The bigotry is very apparent in the story, considering the trajectories of characters based on their religious beliefs. The only expressed atheist is a complete psychopath who is criticized by the protagonist for lacking religious belief, the most religious character in the story is a completely innocent victim who was mercilessly mocked for her beliefs and whom the protagonist claims doesn't push beliefs on others. Faith is a central theme throughout the plot, and the writers are constantly positively reinforcing faith-based characters and negatively reinforcing those who lack them, even by characters who are supposed to represent the scientists of the story. This game had potential to be really good if the writers weren't so obviously bigoted and ignorant of the basic elements of the scientific process.
Tumblr the game.

I don't get the fanbase why they like Chloe, she's a terrible person and I don't know why I should feel sad for her, and wow did you know that's she a lesbian? Say I swear?

The animation sometimes on the last few frames on a scene, they just suddenly disappear or something like a t-pose... 83% on Metacritic btw.

Also, why is Max's voice feels like she's doing an asmr for some reason.

Another thing, bottles, it's just a hide and seek games but with bottles, I had to search on YouTube to solve it.

There's a quote that says : "Yes, I believe I should control the gun, it's the men who needs to be checked." Am I playing a feminazi's game?

[b]Spoilers ahead : [/b]

Bullcrap, what a load of bullcrap ending choices, let me ask you this, would you save a town by sacrificing a person, or a sacrificing a town for just one person? A terrible person, nonetheless.

[h1]Rating :
5/10 (Maybe even lower)[/h1]

It was going so well on the beginning, but it just went downhill as more episodes came on.

Chloe is way too overrated and she's a bad person, characters on the last frames on a scene suddenly disappear, terrible ending choices, Max's voice, also Chloe is a lesbian, please clap.

Only buy this if you are a Tumblr user.
