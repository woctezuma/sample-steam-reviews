[quote][h1][b]Update:[/b] review is outdated, playerbase died and it's probably not recommended to play this game anymore. Instead, try [url=https://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PLAYERUNKNOWNS_BATTLEGROUNDS/]PUBG.[/url][/h1][/quote]
[h1]This is my first shot into Battle Royale-typed games as they are getting more recognized these days, here are my thoughts and review of Last Man Standing.[/h1]

Okay starting off, this game is free to play, and that alone already is a big bonus to me. I've always wanted to try and play this kind of games ever since I quit playing csgo, but I just don't like to spend money on games I don't enjoy playing. This one, is a little bit on the luck side, and I'm just bad with that kind of stuff ;w;
Compared to the big titles like PUBG or H1Z1, this game doesn't have much, but since you don't have to pay anything to play, honestly I think it has what's needed. There IS microtransactions in this game, like... what are f2p games without those...
but anyway, the paid stuff aren't really that useful and overpowered, so it's not really pay to win. You'll still find powerful pickup weapons randomly on the ground, you just have to rely on luck to find those of the better ones.

The graphics are okay. It looks a little bit outdated compared to the bigger titles, but I had no issue playing this game on the graphical side. Not sure if this game's smooth on other hardwares, but it rocks solid on my 1050. Long range vision is okay, but some texture popups do happen. I might just have to fiddle around the graphic options to hit that sweet spot between performance and graphics. Compared to games like PUBG and H1Z1, this doesn't need much to run at solid 60 framerates, but you'll be sacrificing a bit of the visual quality. UI is simple, controls are also good, you just have to dedicate some time getting used of the control layouts. Directional sounds are decent, but good luck fighting your way out in those loud machine gun sounds. The one complaint I have though, is that this game has no bullet tracers, so it's pretty tough to see where you're getting shot from. Muzzle flash are also hard to see in the distance.

Game Mechanics are also great. Weapons have their own specialty, some with extreme recoil, others are just average. As usual, walking makes footstep noise, while crouching and prone doesn't. Depending on the situations, it can get very competitive. You can have like.. three of four players trying to kill you, or you can just bore yourself out camping in the buildings waiting for players to pass through. One downside of the game mechanic is the tedious travel distance. There's no accesible vehicle, so you have to walk for miles to go to the center. And while walking, you're extremely exposed to enemies, unless you go along tree lines or bushes, which is harder to spot from afar.
Oh, also the duo matchmaking thing takes forever since there aren't that many players playing right now.

Overall, this game performs better than I expected, considering it's price (well, no price at all...)
Performance and graphics are good, menu design and game mechanics are also great.
[b][i]BUT[/i][/b]
How much you enjoy it pretty much depends on the way you play it. You'll find yourself having a very tough time trying to be that Last Man Standing considering of how many people you're playing against. If you're just like me who have like... bad luck all the time, you'll pretty much get tired of dying quickly, but nonetheless, it's very satisfying once you've started to kill people and loot their dead bodies.

[spoiler]unless you get killed while looting, poor you.[/spoiler]
It's like when you are in a restaurant, ordered Cola and then waiter asks you "Is Pepsi fine?".

It's same thing as PUBG and LMS. Some people like PUBG more, some prefer LMS.

Generally, it's same concept, with kind of other flavour: PUBG has a waaay bigger map, LMS is more close-quarters centered; PUBG is $30, LMS's free; PUBG isn't optimized, LMS isn't optimiz-wait...

It obviously has the flaws of F2P Early Access game, which are:
- Bugs (which aren't that frequent, suprisingly);
- Microtransactions (which aren't that much of P2W, I mean, you get some additional assets, but it's only up to you if you use them correctly or not; the other thing is cosmetics which is, sadly, a standard now, I guess);
- It doesn't get that much of updates. It's middle of October and the last patch was released in the beginning of September, but it was pretty big, changed few things, fixed many bugs, etc. etc.
- Optimization is bad (for some people), apparently. I can say myself, that the game runs pretty smooth, has some FPS drops but with $500 PC i can't really say a bad word. Even at low graphic settings, the game looks... okay.

So, do you want PUBG? Do you have money for PUBG? If your answers were [i]Yes![/i] and [i]No![/i], then the game's just fine for you.
This is a fairly new free to play game so obviously there are bugs that need fixing but other than that it's a pretty good game overall. The combat is pretty fast-paced, which makes it alot more exciting than running around most of the game and not finding anyone. The average length of games is around 15-20minutes which is pretty good for a battleroyale style game, and makes for faster combat. If the developers polish this game and don't abandon it, it could be a really good game in the future.

This is a very good alternative if you can't afford H1Z1 or PUBG.

Pros:
• It's free.
• The looting system is pretty good in my opinion.
• Can be pretty fun at times.
• A lot of different gun variety, clothes, mainly vanity items.

Cons:
• Animations - The animations were really bad, and the lying down animation completely stops all movement which feels weird when playing. Also the jumping animation is quite shoddy.
• You can pretty much spam painkillers and other meds, and they're insta-heal which in my opinon is a little broken, they should heal over time, and med-kits should heal faster and heal more than painkillers.
• Fairly bad optimization - Needs a decent computer to be able to run it smoothly.

Things that I feel need to be changed:
• Smooth out the terrain so it's not as glitchy.
• Instead of taunts the alt key should turn the camera left and right so you can see behind you, examples: H1Z1 or Rust.

Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)
This game is honestly a wonderful alternative to all of those other battle royale games out there for those who want to get a taste of the genre and for those who just can't afford the more commonly known games like PUBG or H1, people are gonna get mad at the issues but you gotta remember, it's not intentional and they do actively try to fix the game. Just give it a fair chance before leaving a negative review because of some bug that you don't like or because of server issues. That's just not fair at all.

[spoiler]For the record, I do enjoy the game after giving it a chance, which is why I recommend it.[/spoiler]
I have around 200 hours on H1z1, and i wanted to buy Battleground's, but before I did I played this game, and this are my conclusions:

Pros:
-its Free
-the map is smaller(can be good because the games take a lot less time to finish)
-you get crates that give you 3 items or game currency EVERYTIME you lvl up, and a special crate everytime you win a game
-lots of customization and weapon skins (after lvl 5 you probably already look like a badass, and I like that)
-its a lot more noob friendly than H1z1 ( its easier to get the hand of it, and with only 20 hours played, I already won 2 games) on the other hand its less competitive

Cons:
-its in ALPHA...so yeah...some bugs, and some times you will die and you will feel like it was the game's fault
-SHIELDS!! its a game mechanic I inicialy didnt like that much, and you just have to get used to it, and start using it if you want to win(its anoying but once you start using then, it will also be anoying to your enemies)
- you can instant use pills and medic kits, and some times you shot 90% of a guys health bar, and 5 seconds later, he is full health again(then again, like the shields, its goes both ways)
-the  "armor system" in the game! thanks to that, most of the times, headshots dont kill!!!! You probably need to land at least 2, and since they will star healing up the second they get hit, its hard to finish long distance targets some times

In conclusion: I still want to buy Battlegrounds some day, cuz i know for sure it is better... but till then, I will probably keep playing Last Man Standing, because overall the game its quite good in its current state, and the developers seem to care about what the comunity is asking, unlike some companies i know *cof*cof*DayBreak*cof*cof.

So yeah, PLAY IT! its fun, its fast, and even if you suck, you will look like a badass in anytime  :D

This is basically "the poor man's PUBG". And it gives you what that title promises. It's similar enough to PUBG to be entertaining. Though it obviously has less features. But hey, it's free. There are a couple cons: graphics are average (not bad, not good), there are lots of cheaters, the map is pretty small, and the aforementioned lack of features (like for instance creating waypoints on your map, vehicles).
Then again, for a free battle royale game, it's well made. 
If you are a hardcore fan of the genre and don't want to pay for PUBG, play it.
If you are just a casual fan of this genre and want a free alternative to PUBG, try this out, but certainly try Fortnite as well. Fortnite has cartoonish graphics (which I don't really like), but it's smoother and better polished. 
I'd give this game a 6,5/10. Polish it some more and you might get a 7/10  out of me.
the game is very addictive. the graphics are surprisingly very nice. but at the moment, the optimisation is very poor. 
worth checking out if you can't afford unknown battlegrounds because you spend all your money on weed and pills like me.
This game isn't bad, at all. Seems like [i]PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS[/i], but the difference is that it's free. But there are many setbacks.

[h1]The Producers and their lack of seriousness.[/h1]
To start off, Free Reign Entertainment, the studio behind this game; [i]Infestation: Survivor Stories[/i] (the old one, not the remake), [i]Romero’s Aftermath[/i], [i]Burstfire[/i], [i]Rise of the Badlands[/i] and [i]Shattered Skies[/i]. These games we’re all created by this studio. 

So you have been warned if you spend micro-transactions in the game. Who knows, they may stop supporting this game in a few months and work on something new. This happened with [i]WarZ[/i], [i]Infestation[/i], [i]Shattered Skies[/i]. They literally abandoned the games. That’s what Free Reign is known for.

The major difference between both games is that [i]Last Man Standing[/i] offers players up to $10,000 each month in online competitive tournament matches. The top-10 players each month are rewarded, and it’s a way to incentivize more people to hop into the game.

[h1]Release date.[/h1]
[i]Last Man Standing[/i] is a rival created by Free Reign Entertainment against Bluehole’s [i]PLAYERUNKOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS[/i]. Both games are Battle Royle-inspired games that pit multiple players against each other in survival island settings, but [i]Last Man Standing[/i] hasn’t quite managed to get off to the same level of critical fanfare that [i]PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS[/i] has achieved.

The game released 6 days after [i]PLAYERUNKNOWN’S BATTLEGROUNDS[/i]. Curious? I don't know.

[h1]The game.[/h1]
As for the game itself, [i]Last Man Standing[/i] sees up to 100 players in a single instance, all vying to survive in an open-world sandbox. The last man standing is the winner of the round. There are 30 different weapons to choose from and scavenge, as well as over a dozen different weapon attachments.

In order to help players customize their look and feel, there are over 329 different customization options for characters, ranging from skins to clothing items.

[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]
Fight for your live against 100 other players in the free-for-all, free-to-play Battle Royale game [i]Last Man Standing[/i]! Start off with nothing but your fists and scavenge the surrounding area for weapons and supplies, all the while dodging your opponents looking to do the same. Once you’re geared up, take the fight to them and try to become the last man standing. You can kinda say it’s [i]Shattered Skies[/i], but without the open world.

The shooting seems wise. Some players say it's better than [i]H1Z1[/i]; I can't prove because never played.

[quote][h1]Positive points. (+)[/h1][list]
[*]Practice server. You can enter the Battle Royale world, test the weapons, learn the map and have an infinite play time/spawn time. 
[*]Solo and Squad servers.
[*]FPS: the FPS's depending on the area. Personally, I had good FPS's on this game when I played. Some people are complaining about it, I can run it pretty well and I don’t even have a beast computer. 
[*]Competitive mode with eventual cash payouts.
[*]Depending on a match, it can last up to 25 minutes.
[/list][/quote]

[quote][h1]Negative points. (-)[/h1][list]
[*]You have to enter in your password every time you start the client. No option to save it or auto log-in. 
[*]Want to change FOV? You have to restart the game. This is a big mess!
[*]The lobbies being empty: there are some complaints about a lack of players being in the game and the lobbies being empty, but others claim that the lobbies are fine. In general, while I played, players weren't lacking.
[*]Lack of commitment from developers.
[/list][/quote]

I believe that [i]Last Man Standing[/i] has mixed reviews due to the past history of the developers, which isn't the best. I will give a positive review, but I will return to see the evolution of the game.
-It's a fun game, but I think the electric barrier gives little time to loot and have a proper fight with people since healing is instant and medkits can be extremely powerful and the shields can be spawned instantly so sometimes fights can take a long time while the cooldown on the electric barrier is kind of low so it approaches quickly.

-Also, on the same topic, shields are fun, but too easy to place in a heat of battle. There should be at least a cooldown on them or a decent cast time so that when you start shooting someone he can't just instantly turn and have a shield on him. In my opinion shields should be strategically planned in advance when you are making a cover or placing it down to loot a body and not to instanlty place them when you get shot at.

-When it comes to healing it is kind of nice that you can just throw it while sprinting, but it is sometimes too powerful like medkits when you get person low and he heals above half in an instant and you have to kill him again. Those heals should have a cast time at least so they have to be used under cover and not in heat of battle again.(H1Z1 system with a cast and overtime medkit is nice, but I am not sure if you wish to have the same implementation)

-One more thing that kind of bugs me is the damage you can do. For a person with armour you need need a least 2 headshots and a body shot to drop him with an assault rifle(Maybe I am wrong on this, but I can't remember ever having a different experience than this). Body damage is not that bad I guess, but 2 headshots not being a kill is a bit too much I would say.

One more complaint is about the memory leek or something like that since after playing a few games in a row (maybe 7+) I would get an error mentioning the insuficient memory and after the game restart all is back to working. I have seen a few people mentioning this, but it doesn't hurt to write it down again.


-Also, sometimes objects like those sheds next to houses don't render well so I can see people trough it ,but of course can't hit them. That can be a disadvantage for both of us because I know his position ,but I also reveal my position when I start shooting, but can't actually do damage.

In the end I would recommend this game and I have because it is extremely fun for me especially in groups, but like a lot of games it needs some work to make it just right.

( I will post this as "Yes" on whether I would recommend the game, but that makes me uncertain if it would be read for what it is since I know that if I want to better myself I don't go around looking for people to tell me things that I do good, but to tell my faults. )

Cannot afford H1Z1 ?
Cannot afford PUBG ?
Welcome to the Last Man Stand...

Pros :
- Free
- Nice Graphic
- Much Customization
- Run well using my Rog G551VW laptop

Cons :
- Map to small and few house
- Time on waiting lobby to long (bout 3 min. sometimes)
- aim/bullet speed weird for me..PUBG is far better when shooting/aiming..
This is an free version of PUBG. What do you expect in an free version of this type of game? The graphics is average, I wont say its bad though. The big positive about this game is its gameplay. It runs smooth, not buggy and open world. Playing this with a team-mate will be much more fun. Lets talk about cons, The only big dis-advantage of this game is navigation. There is no facility to mark a place in the map so that you can head towards that. Everytime you have to open map to check where you are and by the time you see that you can easily get killed by someone. Overall its a fun game to play. You will definitely have fun if you find a mate to play with.
Only recommend if you're in a similar situation to mine, too poor to get PUBG but in a mood for something similar and willing to accept the lower quality and pay for an advantage system (Which I havent personally noticed).
I dont understand why so many people hating this game... Well, it cannot be good as Pubg's, but it's f2p, and its pretty fun. So if you don't have money for wasting on games, you should definitely try this one!
It's like PUBG, but you can't do as much stuff  in Last Man Standing as you can in PUBG, but if you can't afford PUBG, get this it's good and it's free to play! 

Things that suck about this game: -Cheaters, I think I've encountered a few.
                                                      -Sometimes you will freeze in the load up screen, so  you'll just have to apparently windows and close the game while you're in the loading screen.
                                                      - People with their shitty music playing it on the mic and the fact that they are loud at times, that saying you can't even mute people in this game, you'll just have to lower the voice chat  to not hear anyone.
 - No in-game text but I think they didn't decide to add that due to it being f2p, which makes sense.

- Sometimes the hit dectection is off.
 

Things that are good: -I think the gameplay is pretty good and runs smoothly imo.
                                  -I love picking up stuff its fun.
                                  - Funny taunts.
                                  - Okay graphics but I don't care anyways about graphics.

                                  -I love punching people in the face and punching objects thats what pretty much everyone in this game does.




Btw, this isn't a complete review I'll continue to add more stuff in this review but this is what I got so far. I have't played sq
Join first game
find Agressor
Equip a compenstator
Headshot a dude 3 times and bodyshot twice,he's point blank range away from me
7% hp,shoots me twice I'm dead 
11/10
Good game, decent graphics good fps, good for a free game, however to look cool and have cool items you need to pay that dolla dolla, you can get loot boxes from levelling up but its useless considering you get trash outta them.
Good game but needs works. First off this game needs a better anti cheat, tbh its not good, ive ran into several cheaters. Some sort of vehical would be nice. The eletric field is WAY to strong for as long as you have to run if you are caught in that situation, its almost a guaranteed death. The wait times to get in a game are quite long..ranging from 5-8 mins, there are also times that you join a match and it doesnt have anyone in the waiting lobby and it doesnt fill up. Adding a working leaderboard in duo/squads would be nice to have, also a kill counter in-game would be great to keep up with the amount of kills you or your team has. I only have 30 hours in the game, and these issues are the most that stuck out to me.
PRO's:
-It's FREE, give it a try
-It's good for a F2P alternative to PUBG.
-Fun with friends.
CON's:
-No Australian servers
-Can be buggy sometimes
-Does not support ultrawide monitors (not a crucial point)

*SIDE NOTE*
Contrary to what other reviews say, the boosts feature barely changes anything as everyone earns them and can use them at any time.

I definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to scratch that PUBG itch but don't want to shell out the cash.

Playing this game for the first time and the fact that its free actually its not bad. weapons are good. Simple PUBG style thats not too hard for new players to master. Id recommend this to anyone who just wants to have fun with friends or go on a hunt solo. However a few suggestions i hope the devs can implement. 

1: more weapons
2: add an SMG type weapon and bullet
3: Add vehicles
4: add items such as different lvls of helmet, backpacks.
5: easier to find items like extnd mag, scopes.

Overall an awesome game. :)
You know, this may be from the creators of Infested but it's actually a decent game. Especially considering it's free, there's no room for actual complaining. There's a few tweaks it could use but it's a from game and has potential to be even better. It's no PUBG but it's a fun time.
So I've played a few rounds, 2 to be precise, and I have a good idea of why this game has Mixed reviews.
It's a free to play battle royale, it's decent at holding the tension that H1 and PUBG has, as it's deadly silent until you hear gunshots in the distants, of which you choose wether or not to hunt down. The circle closes almost exactly as you would want. I don't like the idea of boosts, cause it removes the idea of a battle royale; people being equal. If you have a boost, you automatically have an advantage, making people who are new to the game, having a hard time getting close to winning. (Other than my second game I came 3rd place). In my opinion, there's a bit too many supplies. Too much ammo that anyone could handle, and way too many guns that aren't at all hard to find, but I don't really hate the idea of that, I just prefer a harder struggle to get to better supplies before someone gets you. Overall, I like the game, just wish it would make it more equal, in a sense. If I was able to change some things, I would remove boosts, give less supplies, and particularly harder recoil. I give this a thumbs up, and would definitely reccommend to anyone that can't pay for PUBG or H1Z1.
Even tough  I haven't still got much time spent with the game,  for a "free version of pubg"  I DO like and recommend. Ofc  many things that needs to be fixed ( can be read from the other reviews for example.)  but for  being an "overall timekiller" you could say "worth the money" :D
Warzone Battle Inc? Abandoned by the Devs

The WarZ/Infestation Survivor Stories? Abandoned by the Devs (NewZ=Some dude working on the game who used to write hacks for this game and publish it on the same youtube channel with the dev videos... xd ? ) 

Romeros Aftermath? Abandoned by the Devs(Independent guy and his friend work on Artemis Aftermath because they abandoned it)

Shattered Skies? Abandoned by the Devs

This is their *new* game, which uses the same engine like all games before it. They just go with the popular game trends
for some months to cash in and then abandon it. If you want a Battle Royale game just buy H1Z1 and if your a bit more fancy and rich buy Playerunkown's Battleground. But dont play this to death beaten corpse of a game. The Engine is shit, the game looks shit, it plays shit and it runs like shit.
The game at the time I'm writing this review (2/21/18) isn't horrible. It needs lots of work done to it though before I would say to download it. The graphics are nice, and it reminds me of PUBG, but there are glitches. The game should also have cars, or a way to get around faster, because it has a very big map, just like PUBG. There are a lot of custumization options which you can grind for, and the guns are good. The whole item system is fine how it is now. And surprisingly, there's no pay to win aspect at all, and that's great for a free game. There needs to be an anti-cheat system added to this game though, and that's the main reason why I'm giving this game a thumbs down for now. I have experienced hackers kill me, and tons of the poeple who played this game did too. To add on to the bad side of this game, I've seen lots of people write reviews saying they experienced lots of lag, due to the servers. I barely had any, down here in North America, but the devs may want to look into better servers. This game also doesn't have a tutorial, which can be frustrating for new battle royale players. And the feel of the controls are a little bit weird. Coming from H1Z1 and PUBG, those games have a way better movement/control system. Once you get into this game though, I would think you could get used to it. I am using a GTX 1070 OC paired with Ryzen 5 1600 and it runs great on highest settings, so I don't think it will be too hard to run it.

Bottem Line: Wait till this game gets more updates/patches. The game will get better as the devs fix all the cons of the game.

EDIT: Thanks for all the support on this review:)
It was a good "discount" PUBG for about 4 hours... Up until I got banned with no reason given to me. Its a shame as well since me and my friends were having loads of fun.

*edit*
I had a discussion opened up in the steam community section for this game asking about why I got perma banned but it just recently got deleted. Nice one LMS, you loose yourself this potential consumer by not only banning me but aslo cutting all ties by ingoring my questions. 

DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GAME... Just play PUBG or H1Z1.

*edit*
Signed up with a new acount since my friends kept bugging me to play it until we got PUBG. At the end of the day, any game no matter how trash will always be enjoyable with friends.

I still do not recomend this game at all... but if you are going to play it please do not waste your money on the horrid ingame clothing items. Save that money for PUBG.

(Still might get banned once again since my friend lost connection loading up a duo match and that somehow counts as me doing a solo queue... Not my fault the servers are trash.)

*edit*
Just started playing the free to play battle royale mode on Fortnite. (Yes it is free to play, you don't even have to buy fortnite to play it!) Fornite already has a better battle royale mode compared to this game. So I also recomend to try out fortnites version if you get a chance.
This company is literally a scam company and I am shocked steam hasn't taken action against them...they keep recycling the same game tweaking it to suit whatever is popular right now, they will pay a few streamers to play it rake in as much money as they can then abandon the game after a few months. Don't give them money guys seriously.
Not my cup of tea. The fact that players can put up barricades and use items instantly is far too annoying to me. When another player suddenly gains health, okay. That can get a bit annoying. But what killed this game for me by FAR is when you are trying to shoot at a target and a fucking barricade just juts up in front of them. It's so infuriating! It just fucks up the engagements so damn much, and some of these players have these things down like fucking quick draws. Take one shot at them and they do a 180 and put down a barricade instantly. Just fucks up the gunplay which is actually suprisingly not bad. It's a shame too. Without these couple of blaring issues for me, I would have quite a lot of fun here.
Developer: Free Reign Entertainment (known for WarZ, Infestation, Shattered Skies)
What they have in common? All left to die by the developer :)
Stay Away :)
I have 13 hours played i'll just write the positives and the negatives. 

Positives-

Well optomized.

Nice selection of weapons and clothing.

High chance of getting nice gear from the crates you get for finishing high up the ranks.

Faster gameplay than other battle royal games. 

People can't can outside of the Circle just healing. 




Negatives- 

A lot of deployable shileds and nade spams in the final Circle.

Smgs beating Rifles in long range battles. 

Have to go into a menu to attach the weapon attachments, meaning you're just standing there for about 5-6 seconds looking at a screen. 

Headshots don't give kills. 

You and Enemys can  heal up while shooting (painkillers and medi kits give instant health not health over time) meaning you can shoot someone in the head twice and not get a kill. 


Leveling up takes a very long time.




In my opinion -

The game developers don't know what they are doing with the game, it takes a lot of shots to kill someone in the first place and they can just heal that damage up meaning you will spend a lot more time trying to kill them, yet the circle moves at a fast rate and does high damage.  With enemys already having high Hp would suggest they want slow gameplay yet with the circle moving at a fast rate would suggest they want the game to be played fast, i honestly have no idea. 


I don't recommend the game, i only recommend games in which you can just waste your time in and enjoy them while playing, this game creates a lot of frustration especially with being able to heal up to full hp instatnly even if you are about to die from the next bullet. 

LMS is  another lately popular "Battle Royale" kind of game.

Pros:
+Lots of guns
+Huge Map
+There isn't any problem to find a game with +70 players


Cons:
-Lots of guns,but only a few are viable;
-Recoil,and spread are a goddamed joke,even if you find attachments,
-Zone moves too fast,so most of the time you fight with this "blue wall of death" instead of other players,
-Zones aren't random enough.Closer to mid of the map you spawn - closer You are to being in top 10.You will spawn at 
 borders of island - most likely You will get killed,while running to next zone.This game really needs vehicles,or some other way of fast travel.
-Useless taunts,
-Barricades+that huge ammount of medic kits and painkillers spawned make encounters ridicolous - instead of killing 
 enemy in few seconds,you run ,spawn barricades,run again,use medicaments,shoot sometimes,spawn barricades.Totally 
 not my thing.
-When someone hovers crosshair at You,he will se your name,and hp bar,even when you are in bushes.


Overall 4/10,I wouldn't recommend the game to friends.

Last Man Standing is a battle royale game.
The game is from the creators of Infestation: Survivor Stories (formerly known as WarZ).
Like all games before: War Inc, Infestation (WarZ), Romero's aftermath, Shattered Skies and probably soon WILD WEST ONLINE, this game is abandoned by the developers.

You spawn into an open world (no parachutes here), loot up and fight to surive while the circles will be getting smaller and smaller, up to the moment when there is the last man standing. 
Last Man Standing is full of bugs and poorly optimised (like all its predecessors from these developers).
The graphics are ugly and the sounds are just weird.
Nowadays,there are only a few people who are still playing this game.
I would not recommend this game to anyone.

Sounds 3/10
Graphics 4/10
Gameplay 4/10
Atmosphere 3/10

If you can't afford PUBG, just play Fortnite. This game really isn't worth your time.

1) Lots of cheaters

2) Poorly Optimized

3) Fortnite BR is better
CAN WE PLEASE HAVE A WAY TO REPORT HACKERS


Last 4 games i've played have had speed hackers (super speed  / fire rate)

Otherwise i guess this game is already dead before it's released
This game was amazing until they banned my partner for "cheating." They would not give us any proof of the ban but sent a rude comment saying "Sorry you felt you were not skilled enough to be competitive and chose to cheat against other legitimate players. Poor choice. :)" A very immature response. I assume they're hiring 13 years old. Your previous game was a failure and your employees are failures too. Also locking the post so no one can see it and then DELETING it, I'm assuming to hide from their boss and abusing their power, is unprofessional.
One of the worst games I've ever played.
Cons : 
1.Unoptimized - also bad graphics even on ultra. (max 30 fps on avg. system)
2.Mouse lag/stutter
3.No Anti-Cheat
4.Worst Damage model in the history of shooters : You need 3 or more headshots to kill others, even with a shotgun.
5.Loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooong Loading time (like GTA V)
6.Attachments don't matter: be it a Holographic sight, ACOG, or Iron SIghts, all have almost the same zoom level.
7.Painkiller/medkit spam during fights - infinite health.
8.Shield spam - just keep on collecting infinite shields and hide behind it during fights and heal.
9.Bunny hopping
10.Crashes/freezes and stuttering during gameplay, often during crucial fights
11.Just 1 map
12.The barrier/circle moves way too often, limiting the gunplay
13.Even if you are outside the barrier, you can eat painkillers and walk inside it in Slow-Mo without dying
14.Not rank-matched, newbies are met with instant headshot death by high ranking "pros" (after the looooooooooong loading time)
15.Constant server disconnects, usually after the loooooooooooooooooooong loading time.
16.Mediocre(read:unrealistic) ballistics/bullet drop/recoil.
17.Did I mention the Looooooooooooooooooooooooooooong Loading time?

Pros:
1.Free 
2.Not pay2win (unless you count your hardware, then its pay2win)
3.Below average download size (~8GB)
4.Huge player base : find matches anytime
5.Team mode (2-4 players) : the only fun way to play
Pros:
-free / not 30$$ 
Cons: 
-Spawn system (way too often u spawn near the edge, don't have time to loot, die trying to get out of the circle)
-Med heal instantly...you hit a guy 5 times, he's back to 100% instantly.
-Map could use some improvement, it has few zones with small buildings, other than that is open field
-90% of the time you have no Idea who/how/from where killed you.
-No spectate mode
-There should be some sort of matchmaking...where if I am lvl 2 i don't have to play against lvl 30 ppl.
-I play 2-3 games and then it gets frustrating, no enjoyment.
-It takes @ 5 minutes to start a game, just to die in the next 2 or 3.
So, i guess that's it...I still play it because I'm waiting for the payday to buy PUGB, give it a shot for youself, doesn't cost you a thing, maybe you'll enjoy it even more than me.
It's a very bad battle royale game, half the time you dont even see enemy, game is so empty you can be stuck in a queue for 1 hours straight, and developers basicly gave up on the game.
Game is decent for a F2P survival game but scopes, aiming, hitboxes are all a joke.  Bullets don't register and the 3 minute wait for each game is totally unnecessary.  Get shields/ammo/meds and go sit in the middle of the circle fortified until everyone comes to you.  No where near as good of gunplay as PUBG as there is zero skill except positioning in this game.  Point blank miss guys with SMG and frame drops as soon as someone engages in close range... Got a few levels over a few hours but will definitely be moving on.

EDIT: played a few more hours and it is honestly rediculous how off the hitboxes are for bullet recognition.  Scopes literally do nothing and unless you use guns on single fire mode plan on 70% or more missing even when sneaking up behind a guy and having the jump on him and he just turns, sprays and instantly med kits.  Game is garbage for anyone looking for a proper shooter.
Between PUBG and LMS, I think LMS has the scope to be more thrills per play in 'solo' just as it's so damn easy. However!!! Key bindings are a joke! Like, don't even bother trying to change them from the default. If you do manage to change more than 1 default key binding, once you leave the game it will go back to default anyway. For a lefty that would make the game pretty damn difficult. If you want quick games with simple gameplay, LMS is up there, but until the key binding is fixed, not sure I'd recomend this game.
Although this game is free there are still a load of bugs that arent being fixed
First of all, you cant kill a man with a shotgun at close range
Second, anti-cheat is complete shite
Third, Hitboxes are completely fucked
And last of all, the loading screens take too long and usually crash my game
Pure garbage cranked out as quickly as possible to cash in on the Battle Royale fad. Yes it's free and yes you can technically play a full match but the game is more interested in selling you cosmetics than actually being any good. When maxed out it looks like a launch Xbox 360 title, animation is jittery, assets look like they were cobbled together from other games, and collision on environment objects is just awful. The entire presentation is maybe the worst thing I've seen on Steam but don't worry you can HELLA BUY COINS TO KIT OUT YOUR BRO!!!1
there`s an alternative Battle Royale game that is free to play now.
Its called Rules of Survival for low end computer (Intel HD 4000 minimum),
If you had even powerful PC, play Fortnite and H1Z1 (now free)

Or if you had even a load of money to spend with, play PUBG, its much more satisfying than this.
Why?

Its even unplayable than PUBG, that includes Optimization,
When I said unplayable, that means you need an extra NASA computer to run this bad game.
Stop downloading, get a different free Battle Royale game, if you had a lot of time searching libraries.
The developers don't care about this game anymore.
Not to mention there's only a few people playing and most of them are cheaters.
It's full of bugs and poorly optimised.
This game at first had potential but turned out to be another failure.
Fun little game, my wife was in love with it and it was a fun game to pass the time. Unfortunately we were misguided with the early alpha when we could find games. Now not ONE single game has started. The community it dead and in a game style like this one, that means the game as a whole is dead. Has been three days and not ONE game has been started. Unfortunately for my wife and I since we played it over two hours we can't receive a refund and that is $15 we will never get back. I love supporting small dev games like this but I can't when they make no effort to talk to their players on their forums or listen to complaints. They haven't responded to anyone on the forums in over a week. I think they realized that their claims for "big streamers" and more were false and decided to give up on the game themselves! Avoid unfortunately!

UPDATE: Game is now very much populated, but the DEVS clearly don't care about us players. The game is 90% Taiwanese, 8% Brazilian, and 2% USA/CA. Only thing I find entertaining is "The Proving Grounds" as the BR style game is filled with hackers and teamers.
No one plays the game. The barrier that kills you does to much damage. The map is cancer because the starting zone is directly in the middle of the map so when the last couple safe zones are there its a roll of the dice if your doing to live or die. The guns are so similar i cant tell the difference from an smg or a ar. The med kit in the game is not bad that you can heal when being shot. The sniper is extremely rare which sucks i feel it would be more fun with more snipers. The armor system is quiet annoying because it doesn't even seem to help mitigate damage at all. Take forever to get in a game if possible at all. Do not waste ur money on this game i regret buying it every day.
Used to be a really fun game to play back a couple years ago, but unfortunately it looks like the servers are shut down/dead. Really unfortunate to see a game like this die. At least there's thousands of other battle royale games out there on the market now.
Just pay the 5 extra bucks for KoTK.. I waited almost 30min and only like 4 people joined, have to have 30 to start.. should have been free to people who have Shattered Skies.  Yeah, I know the whole deal with the devs.. I just really like BR games; So, I thought to myself "Hey, maybe this one will be different", then I thought "Well, maybe people are using the launcher and not steam to play. So, steamcharts.com could have the numbers wrong".?. Yeah, totally fooled myself into buying it. Now I'm waiting for a refund..
While the gameplay is mildy decent it is often hard to find a match.  Maybe its the lack of people on, but dont pay $15 for a game if there is no one online to play it.
