UPDATE: This review is severially outdated and it will not be correct. Sorry for this inconvience.



When I first got my key, I got really exicted, To the point where I've gotten over 400+ Days on a world w/ my friends. Here are some of the basic things you should keep in mind about while playing with your friends.

Starting off:
Once you start off you have 3 choices or gamemodes to play with your friends, Survival, Wilderness and Endless

Survival: Basically same twist as if you payed endless just if everyone on the server is Dead, a counter goes down for someone to join (That is alive) or the whole world gets reset with the same generation presets.

Wilderness:  When you join the server you spawn in a random location (Sometimes an island if your unlucky) and you need to find your group to set up camp. Once you die or have died you are taken to the change character screen and respawn in a new location with your camera rotated in a different pos and if you look on your map there will be a small circle on where you've last died. Keep in mind you die again that Circle updates to where you last died so try to get back to your stuff without dying.

Endless: Ah, my favorite of all the gamemodes. When you join the server you spawn in from a "Jury-Rigged Portal" And begin surviving. If you die you become a ghost with the character traits of your character. You can respawn if you haunt one of the following. (Meat Effigy, Life giving amulet, Touch stone, Jury rigged portal and Tale-Tell heart) If you respawn from the "Jury-Rigged Portal or Tale-Tell heart" You will lose around 20 MAX Health Points. You can get those lost hit points back from getting a booster shot which requires 3 Papyrus, 2 Healing Salves and 1 Stinger (YES STINGERS FINALLY HAVE A USE)

Once you join the server (Depending on the size / max amount of players) You basically play regular Don't Starve, If join a larger server with more people there's a silm chance that you will be able to survive the up coming winter or Night. Which can be difficult depending if PVP is on or not. And Since armor has now been changed to take Less damage i.e Wood Armor = 80% (Reg ds) 60% (Dst) Marble = 95% (Reg Ds) 80% (Dst) Football helm = 80% (Reg dst) 60% (Dst).

Characters -

Wilson:

Pros -

Grows a beard

Cons - None.

Wilson is a character that i'm pretty sure everyone is going to see ALOT of since he's the first character and Really has no Downfalls even though it takes 19 days for Wilson to get his Homeless man beard it will protect you in winter.

Willow:

Pros -

Doesn't Take fire damage
Starts with a lighter (Infinte torch)

Cons -

When on low sanity Will cause lots of forest fires
Can Grief other players Flamable walls / Crops.

Willow is a good character for surviving the Winter and helping out your friends in DST. But she can be used to be the most annoying person in the entire server. She can run around starting massive forest fires and buring down vauable resources as well as causing LOTS of lag.

Wolfgang:

Pros -

Gets stronger on a full stomach
Has more hp

Cons - 

1.5x the faster Hunger drain at full stomach
Moves and deals less damage at a smaller stomach
Loses more sanity in Night / Afternoon

Ah, Wolfgang more of a fighter than a gardener. Wolfgang can be useful for tanking spiders nest and killing of those annoying Tall birds and getting there eggs the only downfall is If you have a lot of food toghether It's not going to last very long amongest 6 Players, If you are playing as wolf gang only "Power up" to full stomach when in need. Don't just waste food to be a full stomache because food WILL be eaten fast.

Wendy:

Pros -

Has a ghost sister
Doesn't lose much sanity in dark

Cons -

Does -.25% Less damage than all characters
Loses 50 Sanity when spawning abigail in

Wendy is one of my personal favorite characters just to add a little challange to the game. Even though she doesn't hit hard she losses NO Sanity in the Afternoon. As well she can spawn her sister in after 2 - 4 Days by killing ANY Animal / Creature Near the flower. She will lose 50 sanity for spawning he in even if another player kills something near the flower. But the fun part is Abigail does Splash damage to mobs near her. If you need to fight something send abigail (or your friends) to kill it. If abilgail dies go pick her flower up, If you can't find it theres a minimap icon for it.

WX78:

Pros - 

Can eat ANY Food that is spoiled /  Stale and take no penalty.
Can be charged by lightning
Can eat gears to level up (Max 400 hp, 200 Hunger, 300 Sanity) Also gears give health, hunger and sanity back if eaten.

Cons -

Takes Damage in the rain
Starts with low stats (100 hp, 100 hunger, 100 Sanity)

WX78 Is a good character if you can get to a supply of gears fast as well your going to need to hunt down a pig village for an umbrella. If you don't get an umbrealla right off the bat you will loss 0.25 of 1 Hp every 3 - 5 Seconds. If your lucky enough and you make an umbrealla you won't have the chance of being struck by lightning which will cause you too lose 33 Sanity but Not freeze during winter and can glow like a torch the effect only lasts for one day so don't be adventuring in the middle of the night if the Radius of light is shrinking. But can be benifical if you use if effectively.

Wickerbottom:

Pro -

Starts off with all science machine reciepes unlocked.
Able to craft her own books
Starts off with 2 Papyrus.

Cons -

Can't Sleep
Takes more penalty for eating Spoiled or Stale food

Wickerbottom, The walking science machine, You can pretty much help your friends by going right to an achlemy engine instead of wasting the time of making an Science machine. Even though you can't Sleep there are multiple ways of getting your sanity back up. With the abiliy to make your own books  you have the power to instantly grow all crows and Plants, Spawn lots of birds and more for the cost of your sanity. And yes I know this sounds like wickerbottom is a bad character, as long as you know how to get sanity back without murdering the flower population.

The Rest of the characters have no been added while writing this review.

Over all this is a great game and I recommend it to any and all players.

EDIT: YOU DON'T NEED DON'T STARVE TO PLAY THIS YOU JUST NEED A DON'T STARVE TOGHETHER KEY. PLEASE STOP ADDING ME
Just spent an 8 hour session with a stranger who was willing enough to show me the ropes. From a basic camp, we managed to establish a good base of operations growing crops, setting up spider lairs, bee hives and beefulo herds. Definitely appreciate players such as Hxgvamp to take the time to teach a noob what to expect in this new lore. 10/10 gameplay, 9/10 replayability, 11/10 community.
The only game I play on Steam, and I am still addicted to the art, storyline and co-op (don't starve TOGETHER) aspect of it !

edit: Geez I wrote this review last year 5/31/2017 with around 2,500 hours 
and its 11/20/2018 and now I have around 4,800 hours... it has consumed my life lol
My second favorite game, 
I bought the game with my ex for our six months(It was on sale)
At my first time playing I couldn't understand a thing
I had to check on Google/watch videos, I was so afraid to fight spiders and couldn't survive more than a week
I start to play more only recently and now I can understand more, the game is very interesting and I managed to survive 140 days without dying once as Wendy!, Wendy is my favorite character cause of Abigail :)
You can survive with any character but it's hard to me as WX-78.. the summer and the winter are affects him even if he is robot and to fix him you need gears. For me it's pretty hard to get gears, maybe put more tumbleweeds instand of fighting with the clockworks. 
The style is very cool and cute.. the music is amazing but annoying after a period of time,
especially like the idea of the pets.
I recommend adding mods like more options/more items/more characters, but don't put everything you see.. cause it's more fun when its balanced, 
But to enjoy the game you have to spend a lot of time so if you have a time and interest to play this game, Go for it
A very good game, also abit disappointing because sometimes the base is destroyed because of something dumb and then you need to rollback or live with it......
I don't recommend it for mad/rage people :I
This is the one thing this game was missing, multiplayer! And it is extremely well done!
You can host your server from the game without the need for port forwarding, downloading extra server files etc.
The way the servers handle mods is also great, if the server has a special server mod it is automatically transfered to your client (this is unnoticable), with the exception of some client side mods (UI related and such)...
All in all, if you love Don't Starve, you MUST get this expansion!
Even if you don't have friends, you can play on public servers, the community is great out there!

P.S. I gave the extra copy to one of my friends already so please stop adding and asking if I can give you the extra copy. (I write this only because I have recieved multiple friend requests from people who saw this review asking me if i could give them the extra copy)
An interesting new twist on the original Don't Starve, it now proves to be quite a challenge.

New features include: 
-Twice as many mouths to feed
-People who eat their scarce rations without first cooking it
-People who sit at home base and squawk for food like a baby bird to its mother
-People who don't wear armour expecting to dodge every attack like an anime character
-The ghosts of said people, draining everybody's sanity both in-game and real life
-Terribly organised bases
-Terribly organised chests
-Stuff thrown everywhere by people who just plain despise organisation
-People who draw treeguards into our designated tree farm
-People who try to tank hounds
-People who try to tank tentacles
-People who try to tank ANYTHING
-People who wander off and then scream when they get lost
-People who wander off because they saw a "Truffala tree" (I'm looking at you, Jonah)
-Twice the map sizes
-Twice the treeguards
-Twice the hounds
-Twice the spiders
-And most importantly, twice the starving to death

And I loved every single minute of it.

This is the first game that I have ever written a review; I have never gotten bored playing this game. You have many option to play the game either with friend, alone, or random. Unlike other game, the community is not toxic at all, and I have seen many nice people willing to teach the newbie even though they are not friend. In conclusion, this game is very fun to play, and the creator update the game very often, and they create many events for the community to enjoy, so I recommend to get this game even you don't have friend because you will meet more people and become their friend once you play it.
Where do I start? This game is great if you like survival games. It's easy to get the hang of but it also has lots of challenging elements. Playing singleplayer is pretty challenging and I don't recommend that for people who are new to the franchise. The game, after all, is called Don't Starve TOGETHER. Multiplayer is great. If the host doesn't have a great connection it can be laggy. 98% of the time the game runs fine online. There are so many character mods and music mods in the workshop for this game that it never gets boring. What's even better is that when you buy the game you get a copy to give to a friend. Overall I think this is a great survival game and I definitely, recommend Don't Starve Together.
Nothing is more satisfying than minding your own business (be it cooking or mining) and having your friend start screaming over Skype and have a death message pop up at the top of your screen.
Hop on first server I see.
Pick Wilson.
Greet new friends and ask what the plan is.
Just starting to build camp and get set up.
I notice the camp is in the middle of a big forest.
I point this out and helpfully comment on how wrong things go if a fire got out of control. 
"Perhaps we should relocate for the sake of safety?"
"Lol don't be such a baby, make your own camp if you dont like it!"
"Fine I will make my own camp! with Blackjack and Hookers! and It'll be better!"
Proceed to make own camp with afformentioned Blackjack and Hookers.
Few days pass.
Come back home after a hard days foraging to find all my Items have been nicked.
I am now royally screwed, all my materials, tools ect. gone.
I know it was them.
An evil plan for revenge hatches in my mind. 
Wait till night time. sneak over to other camp with torch in hand.
Thefoolssuspectnothing.jpg
They still havent removed most of the trees around their camp.
Set fire to one tree.
Next tree catches fire.
Whole forest ablaze in a matter seconds.
They all either burn to death or are torn apart by the beasts in the dark as they flee in panic.
Retrieve stolen items and also pillage corpses.
I am now the king of this world and none can oppose me.
Feels good man.
Bask in my victory for a while.
"Server connection timed out"
And thus was the downfall of King Wilson the terrible.

11/10 Would Commit Virtual Arson again.

I have such a soft spot for this game. Its visuals, its music, its characters - all of it pops out in such beautiful charm, and the gameplay has such a simplistic style that it makes you invest in it, and the more you invest, the more you discover and thrive as a player. You are going to die. A lot. Whether it be to starving, to the darkness, to your own insanity, or even to spiders. Don't Starve doesn't hold your hand. But you get better, you learn from your mistakes, and you overcome your weaknesses. 

I rarely play online with strangers, but with a group of friends, it is a blast. Huddling together at night, working hard during the day, using your character's strengths to work with those of others, it's so much fun. You build and build until you realise that you're all, in a funny way, a family. A bunch of people stranded and who must work together. 

Get this game. It's one of the best survival games I've ever played. Fun by yourself, amazing with friends. 9/10.
Don't Starve Together has been an amazing experience. But that is because I played the original game and have a good understanding of the basics and intermediate gameplay. For the uninitiated it can be a long dark perilous road to making it past the first winter. I however highly recommend buying this game and the single player version. With no in-game tutorial and no real tooltips you find yourself googling and asking other players for advice on how to deal with daily life. Everything kills you, especially your friends. The pace of the game may feel slow but soon the amount of resources to gather and refine become immense and turn this game into a fast pace race to gather the gear to survive the winter.

In closing this game has an unforgiving learning curve which is only magnified by the masses of new players who have never tried the single player experience. Prepare to fail many times through your own mistakes and those of others.

Have fun and don't burn the berry bushes. Don't Starve Together is a MUST BUY from Klei Entertainment.

Going back to the original Don't Starve where the game was meant to be antisocial and isolation had helped push the insane world deeper into the player's mind, we didn't expect, or at least I didn't, we'd be able to share our adventures with our friends. And how did that work? Well, it worked out brilliantly. 
  Don't Starve Together is entirely based on team cooperation and surviving through the hardest of obsticles to reach a level of satisfaction when you come back to your own base, where it feels like home, because of all the effort you have put. You take down bosses with enormous hp pool for their loot, you explore the dark caves, you find secrets and you end up spending a ton of hours in the Don't Starve wikia just so you can strategize your next approach in the game. 
  But Klei should be sincerely thanked for, because they keep on working on the game, they add fun events, the devs stream the game as they answer fan questions fairly often. They are a small team invested in bringing the best experience. Since Early Access until now, there has been an enormous amount of content added to the Don't Starve world. 
  And let's not forget, there is a whole community of hardworking people providing us with great content in the workshop. Invested in creating new mechanics and add their own touch to the world. Thank you guys for making this an even greater experience.
This is my first review ever in steam. I think my hours in this game express more than anything i can possible say.

Amazing Artwork / Animations
Amazing Sandbox / Survival type of game
Endless fun and salt shared with Friends

Thank you Klei for making your previous Master Piece (Dont Starve) into Multiplayer!

The beefalo.

When I first set my eyes on this adorable abomination, I did not think, 'What an ugly bastard.' Rather, I thought, 'What a cute fuzzy animal.' I never thought to kill this giant, mellow beast because I was sure that behind those peaceful, lamenting eyes was fury and pain if I were to ever anger this beast. So, I decided to set up a base close enough to gather its wool, but far away enough so it would not wander into my base at nightfall.

The autumn days whisked by, and I was starving. Low on food, I decided to try to do something to fix my food woes; steal a tallbird's egg. As a new player, this was the worst thing I could have done.

It pecked me viciously, dealing huge damage to me. I ran back to my base, where it stopped chasing me and went back to the nest. I was dangerously low on health.

Then, I heard Wilson speak.

'Did you hear that?"

Yes, I did, in fact, started hearing those hounds bark. I knew it all to well, for those hound attacks have ended my previous runs twice now.

In an effort to save myself, I ran to the beefalo, hoping they would provide protection from these cruel beasts. 

The hounds came swift, one by one, as they chased me through the savannah. Soon, they started attacking the beefalo herd, and the beefalos quickly dealt with each hound one by one, and all the hounds died thereafter.

I vowed to myself that I would remember this. These beefalo saved my life. I would never try to harm a beefalo for the rest of my days.

Winter came. Luckily, from shaving those beefalo and decimating that spider nest back in the forest of graveyards, I was set to survive. Until the midwinter night came.

Moans from a creature I have never heard of before. I was prepared this time for any attack, I thought. I had created a few log suits, and a spear to deal with these attacks. What I was not prepared for was a giant deer with one eye to pop out from the night and proceeded to destroy my base.

I thought to myself, holy crap, I am done for. Then I realized. I have my beefalo!

I was stupid.

I tricked the Deerclops into attack the herd, and the herd came back to strike him. Then, I realized the entire herd froze over.

What I was not prepared for, was the AOE destruction that the Deerclops has.

Thinking to myself, I can't let these beefalo die! These things have protected me through thick and thin!

Running to save the beefalo herd being pounded, I speared him, and took 15 damage. And another 15. And another 15.

My log suits quickly wore out, and soon, I was left with nothing but my winter hat. Still, I fought on, until it struck me with one final blow for 75, and I died, along with the beefalo herd that I promised I would protect. I was sad, that my run would end trying to protect these beefalo with my life.

That was my fourth run, back when I started up this game in 2013. I've played through hundreds of worlds since then, trying to go further. From killing Dragonfly, to trying to delve into the Ruins. And every time I died, I was frustrated, and I even quit a few times, but in the end, I would make a new world and begin again. 

Not out of a sense of 'I should try to survive longer' but in the sense of, 'There's still so much I haven't experienced.'

The 'Don't Starve' artstyle, the gameplay, its lore, everything about it charmed me. To say this game is good is an understatement; this game is one of the most fun I had throughout my years of playing any game, period.
This game has a very good reason to hold the "overwhelmingly positive" reviews on steam since day one. 
-Original
-Challenging 
-Addictive
-Fun Co-op
-Deerclops
Everything in this game kills you.

Don't Starve
or go into the night.
Don't lose your marbles;
this is your endless plight.

Don't go down a sinkhole
and don't get stung by bees.
Don't forget to feed the pigs
and don't over-farm the trees.

Be vigilant and mindful
and listen for the sounds.
As sure as there is night and day
there will be countless hounds.
This game is really about teamwork.
You have to share food, supplies, weapons, and clothes between all players to survive longer (which is the goal of this game). The game saves your progress automatically with each new day so you can continue playing in the same world. You don't have to play until you're starving in game and/or in the real world :D

I played it with friends and also with random players and my recommendation is to try it with friends.
You can't just let a friend go hungry or let him/her face the hounds alone, right? You set up a base together and make some labor division, give them a nice Garland. 
I found it a bit difficult to do all the things above with a player I never met before.

That being said, the game is an excellent way to test your inner survivor and to learn to work in a team.
Not starving is fairly easy..... it's everything else thats hard.

    [/tr]
Here's a typical first time experience:

1) Create world
2) Reach nighttime, and think you can survive without a fire
3) Die because this game is not like Minecraft

4) Create new world
5) Attack and kill your first spider
6) Sweet! Monster meat! Maybe it can restore my low health
6) Spend 5-10 minutes regretting that decision, then notice the spider horde you just aggroed
7) Escape with 20 hp, looking for healing item
8) Find red mushroom

9) New world
10) Inevitable hound attack (we died to this first time, admit it)

11) New world, finds pig village
12) They dont attack you on sight, they defend you from hounds, They're nice right?
13) Set up base in village
14) Day 11, why do the pigs look diff- OH GOD

10/10, would die to werepig again

Quick Edit: This is when you hop on a public server and hope someone can carry you, although almost everyone is nice, just chill, have fun and don't starve out there :D
I can't tell now i like this game or not. Maybe when i will reach 3000 hours then i will know. gtg see ya


13.11.2018

Its worth of bying?   - Yes it is

Do i like it?              - its my personal, darn question!
As me being not a fan of single player games I decided to pick this game up with a friend. So this review is mostly directed to those who also haven't played the original game.

The Art style and the humor of the game are great. I love every little detail about it. The dark setting and humor really make the game quite enjoyable. Our first attempts to survive failed all around day 5. We couldn't stop there though. We improved and so we discovered more and more of the game. Even now we live in a world on day 43 and still I am learning new stuff. The terrain generation gives you plenty of random things to play with.

As for the multiplayer  performance. We never had the server crash on us. I never had a client crash. It is already a very solid product. When I read the word Beta I was set to experience some bugs and crashes. But none until now. 

If you haven't played the game. Go and play it.

Update: Haven't played this game for a while and picked it up again recently. I really am enjoying the fact that they added even more content and refined the existing features. Really pumped to give the "A New Reign: Part 2" Update a try tonight.
No matter the hours You put in this game it keeps it´s novelty and never gets old.
Countless strategies and different ways to achieve Your goals.
The game offers a truly unique experience playing it solo, but if You play in a multiplayer world - no matter if it´s co-op or PVP warfare - the random factor of actions Your fellow players take elevates the whole experience to a sweet multplayer gaming nirvana.

A true masterpiece.
Seriosuly buy this game. 
While its quite immersive and vast when you play it single player, it is so much more fun playing it with friends! You will get tons of laughs out of this game as you and your friends die a million times over. This game is quite hard for newer players, but that is why exploring the game and finding out you could do certain things is that much more fun. There is something for everyone in this game! The characters are so different from each other that it helps encourage certain playstyles such as a crafter and or a fighter for example.
Overall this game is solid fun and will keep you enertained for a long time to come. (Especially with your best friends!)
Don't Starve Together is a game that I can say quite a lot about even as someone who hasn't played the original Don't Starve. If you are wanting to buy this game, but you intend to only play it by yourself, then I strongly suggest you stop now, don't get this game, and get the original Don't Starve along with its DLCs instead. If you still want to get this game, then I'm just going to say that there is a lot to learn about this game and you'll need to know stuff about the original Don't Starve as well. 

You don't need to know the plot of the original game to know what Don't Starve is about. Even though it is a sequel in a way, you don't need to know what happened. Basically, you're going to be dropped into a world and you are going to have only one goal, survive as long as you can. There is a lore to the game, and it is an incredibly rich lore that should definitely get some sort of attention because it's really interesting and ever so more expanding. The world is already interesting enough with the kind of creatures it holds and what each of the playable characters can do, but it's that lore that does make this world all the much the better once you know it. 

Right off the bat, the game spews charm from it. From character and monster designs, to the artstyle, the old vintage look, and even down the music which sounds like what you would imagine the world would have. I can sit on the main menu of this game for hours to listen to the theme. 

You'll have 12 characters to pick and choose who you'll play as, each one with different stats and different abilities that make them stand out from each other. For players who have already played Don't Starve, you won't have to worry about these characters needing to be unlocked, they're all unlocked right out of the gate. Also for players who have played Don't Starve, the characters have changed a bit in order to be a bit more balanced for multiplayer. Each character fits a different play style so you'll never feel as though you're playing as the same character, and you can feel the differences with each character and you'll find someone with a playstyle who you'll enjoy playing as the most.

This game is not easy and if you are new, you'll probably not survive for very long in it especially if you do not know what to do. The game is not going to teach you anything, you'll either have to learn to survive as you play, learn from other players, or research about the game. At no point are you ever going to be safe. You'll have to eat to keep yourself from starving, find ways to restore your character's sanity so that way you don't go insane and be attacked by shadow creatures, fire can spread and destroy precious resources, some resources can't respawn, some creatures will attack and try to kill you, and there will be a pack of hounds that will randomly come after you as you go through each day. Even changing seasons will be a hazard as you'll either have to survive the cold of winter, the storms of spring, or the heat of summer. It may be hard to get into first, but once you get a grasp of the game and how it plays, it feels so satisifying to be able to survive longer than you used to. You'll need to craft items to survive and even craft items to craft even more items and you'll need as much as you can and know exactly what you need to survive for so long.

The one thing that stands about this game over the original Don't Starve is that this one has online multiplayer where you can play up to 6 other people. You can play by yourself, but it won't be easier than playing with others unless you have mods supported by the Steam Workshop. If you're going to play this game with others, I highly recommend playing with friends. 

If there is one thing I can say about this game is that it will get reptitive. Once you get the hang of the game, it's just a matter of surviving as long as you can and if you are able to learn the game to the point where you know everything about it, you'll have nearly nothing to worry about. 

If you want a challenging survival game and one that you can play with friends, this game is definitely for you and I can highly recommend it to others. Even though it can get repetitive after a while, I still find it to be a fun game where you'll always have to be doing something to survive and keep going, and with the developers continuing to add more stuff to the game and showing a great passion for it, I can see it being supported for a long time.
The only game that allows you to be a boy inside a spider wearing a top hat, riding a buffalo/cow hybrid observing a cyclopean deer fight it out to the death with a sentient tree, while evading bipedal pigs by using explosive mines filled with bees, all while half a forest is burning down in the middle of winter because of a miniature star...

Together.
An amazing survival game that is updated quite frequently. Both fun and challenging at the same time, playable even without friends, maybe even better to play alone because your friends will just die all the time and you have to waste resources on them because they are useless and you are doing all the work.
10/10
although i've only played it for about 3 hours; here's what i can tell.

1.) the game

there is minimal lag, and you do not need the hassle of port-forwarding and hamachi and all that, it's already set up! aswell, the game is great and well balanced for multiplayer.

2.) community
the community is friendly, and most of the time, people will band together and make settlements. 4 hands are better than 2! i find that we all get together at night, make food and plan on what we will do tommarow, wether it be gathering food, building walls and traps, or sending a small group of 3 to hunt down a large monster, or to go out and gather more bushes, grass and saplings.

3.) Cons
the game goes a bit too fast sometimes. what sould have taken around 100 days turns into something you do in the first month. aswell, food (although still a problem) is nearly non-existant when you have someone that gathers rabbits and berries in the morning. this goes for health aswell, as bees seem to be someone's top priority. if you are not dumb, or take something on too tough for you, you will never die. (unless you are WX because rain is so BS)

4.) end result
the game is well balanced and fun. there is a dynamic knowledge of what we need to do. you can eventually get to a point where you have "morning routines" like gathering the rabbits from the field, and harvesting honey, without the worry of needing to spend your ENTIRE day doing that, like you do in singleplayer. the game move much faster, and the ability to respawn (if you have nice teammates) makes it much more enjoyable, with the fear of permideath always on your shoulder. i would reccomend this game to those that did not enjoy the super-stress of the singleplayer, but likes the overall gameplay, or just because they want to play with friends. this, however, is a short burning flame. the game does not last long, as server hosts need to leave, ending the game for everyone. in the end, however, i give it a good review. it is great gameplay with a slight gameplay twist, that ends up turning it into what seems as an entirely new game by the devs. 8/10; brb going to go play it again.
Sometimes, we choose games based on a variety of criteria: the preferred genre, sensory engagement, friends' recommendations. We read reviews, compare walkthrough videos, look for replayability value. Curators, Steam sales, Humble Bundle - it all paints a rather complex picture of what we do before making our mind.

And sometimes, games choose us. 

I have never been a person favouring survival games. I have never touched multiplayer before. My approach to games is that of a narratologist: I see them as stories. Thus, I am naturally better-disposed towards examples rich in narrative, possibly less flexibility in shaping the plot, but a fully-fleshed character and loving mythopoeia. I do not need other people to enjoy the action of a BioWare RPG or the king of first person sneakers like Thief. These are as wonderful on their own.

I received DST as a gift from my friend. With no practical experience in multiplayer games, I took the plunge due to her own magnificent person. And on the colourful crusade against death of bees and pengulls (my typical bane at the time), I caught the bug going by the game's name. Beginning to host myself, with the ability to create more hostile maps through the careful use of prefab presets and lore-friendly mods, then starting a group to coordinate our sessions and joining the Klei forums came naturally, with little to no realisation on my side. And finally, with a group of similarly-minded regulars in love with the written word, we took our TDE wilderness adventure into the game for the added challenge of survival while storytelling. 

On the doorstep of my first anniversary of setting foot outside the familiar glowing portal, I am honoured to highlight the impressive replay value of DST. With plenty of detailed reviews dealing with the intricacies of the game, I would rather focus on the bigger picture. DST is one of the rare games growing with you. You start as a rather hapless freshman in a world of wacky science, grim-sweet humour and dangers galore. You learn the importance of bearing a light as darkness approaches, remembering your fragile sanity and crafting items whose recipes are often amusingly bereft of sense (whoever thought wearing a fantasy elephant's trunk as a vest would be a good idea, I applaud you). Topmost, you die. Often. In very endearing ways. But you (hopefully) learn from your mistakes and with time find yourself successfully facing the most daunting of threats. 

At some point, you feel you have beaten the game. You have at least one big camp spreading across the horizon, parade in thulecite gear and fry giants with magical staves. But this is the point where it is all starting: you seek new ways to challenge yourself. You tinker with worldgen options ("Let's set hound mounds to lots!"). You browse the workshop for mods (where Sturgeon's Law is as accurate as ever, yet still worth the risk for the elusive 10% of gems). You try out new characters, new strategies, new maps. You come up with your own challenges beyond Lights Out. You are prone to becoming the member of the community whose lair is the forums and secular cult: the hallowed Potato Cup. Maybe you actually start GM-ing a wilderness adventure to expand the elegantly unobtrusive plot.

Finally, you likely realise the human aspect of Don't Starve [i]Together[/i] in comparison to the impressive singleplayer. It is more fun, more engaging, more threatening, even, to die in company. Which, naturally, is many-faced, since the people you meet on public servers are as likely to make a griefer coming-out as become acquaintances, game buddies, friends. DST, while with many differences to its predecessor Don't Starve, can be played alone, with no player slots open or a password. But most people, yours truly included, find soloing with no other transients around rather upsetting after a longer while. Your character may be thriving on their own, but your own mind will keep processing the eerie solitude of this fascinating world. 

Disclaimer: my game copy was a gift. Since then, I have been picking DST as a go-to present. Another friend of mine is scheduled to receive her own for Christmas. The bug is very virulent.
Now you can try to Don't Starve Together with friends!
It's chaotic.
You will starve.
You will die a lot.
You will hate the winter season.
You want to slaughter your friends.
You will miss your friends (when they starved to death).
You will BURN SHIT DOWN WHEN YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE GHOSTS.
You will accidentally burn down your berry bushes that were placed too close together (trust me, playing as WX-78 is a pain sometimes).
You will play with friends that don't know anything about the game and instantly regret it.
You now think Don't Starve Singeplayer sucks after playing Together.
You really want to see that update where you can ride beefalo's (coming in spring 2015)!
You will subscribe to the newsletter because this game and company is awesome.
You will give a copy to a friend. (Unless you are lonely. But why are you playing a co-op version of this game then?!)
You will ask your friends to play this until they regret it so much that they decided to buy a new game and play that to death until you stop asking. (TABLE! STOP PLAYING REBIRTH AND LETS PLAY THIS AGAIN!)
But the most important thing: You will have fun and laugh at everything that happened in this game!

P.S.: TABLE, U Y NO PLAY THIS GAME WITH ME ANYMOER?! I CRI EVYTIEM. ;-;

Played with a friend.
Got a good base.
Survived and thrived for 20 days.
Winter came.
Convinced the friend to go and get honey.
He died.

10/10 Would send him to his death again.
Been alive for a good number, just about to hit winter. Me and my friend had everything stocked up; tons of bunnies in the chests, two ice boxes filled with food from our farms and drying racks, two crockpots just for those nights that you needed really filling food, two themal stones, enough clothing to keep warmth for a decent distance away from base camp.

Had a wall built with three or so beefalo corralled in so that we could get manure and beefalo wool during the night. Honestly, we had this entire thing down set, winter wasn't going to beat us. 

He said he was going to the bathroom and left me to tend to the fire to keep us through the night. Naturally, I didn't have any problem with that- surely we were set for a night. 

And then my character heard something in the distance, something that was getting closer increasingly faster. Thinking it was just a wolf, I grabbed my spear and armor, wolves weren't anything to worry about. 

Except the ground shook the closer it came, rattling every item on the map until this amalgamation of horror came onto the screen; giant antlers protruded out from above a single wide eye, every exhale this creature took gathered in a fog from it's mouth hole, every single stomp from a gigantic hoof sent rows of jagged ice along the ground like piston. 

When my friend came back from the bathroom, everything was gone. He died instantly, unable to move or defend himself from the Deerclops, a sad ghost who could only haunt my already dwindling sanity through the duration of the very short fight. The Deerclops knew how to get me too, chasing me around my own camp until the fire inevitably went out, unable to throw anything into the fire for fear that the behemoth creature would kill me instantly just as he did my defenseless friend. Blind now in the darkness, all I could do was run around some more in a desperate attempt to find my fire pit before Charlie bore down on me, snuffling out the last vestiges of health I had before it was all over. 

What happened?! My friend exclaimed when he came back, incredulous that this much could happen in a span of a few spare minutes, the monochromatic view on his screen the same as the utter failure that was on my own. 

Indeed, my friend, what happened? 

10/10 Would play again
Great gameplay mechanics and a stunning artstyle make this one of the best multiplayer games you can experience. 

[i]Don't Starve Together[/i] improves on the original survival single player experience by adding a multiplayer mode that's both fun and balanced.  

None of the newly introduced multiplayer elements feel gimicky - the new player haunting system is an excellent addition and is a great way to get players to work together. 

The game also offers multiple lobby types catering to every type of playstyle - this helps to eliminate toxicity in the community leading to a more enjoyable experience for everyone. 

[h1] Verdict: [/h1]

Firstly, this is a survival game designed for players that are into the survival genre, but it's also a great introduction for players wanting to try out a new, unique experience. Secondly, this is honestly a great example of how to build a solid multiplayer experience off of a single player foundation. With excellent modding support and great devs, this is an absolute no-brainer to get.

10/10
★★★★★
I got it all the way back in Beta, a year or two ago. It's uncompromising, but not as hard as you'd think, once you get the hang of things.

That being said, you will die. A lot.
Especially with your friends, who will, at one point or another, decide they have the power of a god and attack that thing you knew was dangerous. They [i] will [/i] . And it'll be [i] hilarious [/i] . Trust me, it's an awesome experience.

Worth every penny, and a few more.
10/10.

Best game for long distance relationship gaming (or just coupling gaming for that matter).

I play this with my long distance boyfriend and boy did we learn a lot about each other. You learn about depending on each other, building a home, and forgiveness when one of you accidentally set the whole base on fire.
Don't Starve Together

The game is truly amazing.  Note, that you can play it totally alone if you wish.  

For those who havent played dont starve, you're trying to survive in a surprisingly deeply simulated ecosystem that's illustrated like a Tim Burton cartoon.   Lots of trial and experimentation is required (or else much perusing of the Wiki).  It takes hundreds of hours to fully understand the world you're in.

The difficulty is that those who have played a lot of dont starve have so much more expertese than those who have never played it that it's the equivalent of a wilderness survival guide taking an 8 year old city kid camping.

There are PVP servers, avoid them if you arent experienced in the game, it's not the way most of us play it, but some people love it that way.  New players joining these servers are fodder.  Joining an open Co-op world you may be able to find someone to help you.

The only quibble is lack of goal or endgame content.  In the base 'dont starve' you have 7 gates to pass through and a great mystery to solve (why they hell you're in this world in the first place).

The game is filled with quainltly beautiful struggles for survival, and benefits a lot from cooperation.
One of the best and most unique survivals I've ever played.
The style and the world is like nothing you saw before.
Beware as this is a trial and error experience, expect to die a lot.
There is so much content in this that you can keep entertained for hundreds of hours, especially if you like sandboxes.
The developers are incredible, this game sure was carefully crafted with us the gamers in mind.
It's nice to see people caring so much about their community.
10/10
Honestly, Klei Games, (The people that made this) are my favorite game company. They make good crud. Hard, difficult crud. This game will kill you. Repeatedly. Sadistically. Mercilessly. It won't wait for you to catch up. It won't give you a break when you need it. The game's title isn't an instruction, it's a challenge. But gosh dang it, Klei, you made a good one. Why? One of the marks of a great game, is the fact that even if you 'lose' 99% of the time, you still have fun. A game that doesn't say enjoyment=success. A game that you can laugh at your own stupid, stupid demise as you get mauled by 100 penguins while desperately getting the ice you need to make jam. (Yes, you read that right). So yeah, buy the thing. They still support the game with events, and if you have even one friend to play with, I guarantee you'll love dying to their eventual betrayal when you guys realize there's only one meatball left for the winter.
My son and I enjoy plaing this game.  It funny and kinda trippy too!  It's all about staying alive and learning survival skills.  You craft different items such as your axe and hammer and build fire pits but it's not as easy as it sounds.  It's a point and click game, online with friends too, and fun for the whole family!  Highly recommended!
One of the best co-op experiences until now (2018). If you like the art-style, music or the gameplay look no further, Don't Starve Together will be an amazing adventure and you should definitely try it. 10/10
I really love this game. I've played Don't Starve Together again, and again, and again, all over again. I always come back to this game when there's a new update, the art is really unique as well as the soundtrack. You always find new things to do and is truly a great game to play with a friend, or maybe a bunch of them. Highly recommend it
Loving the game so far, heres my review: 
TBH it got really boring when playing alone ( Meaning when we didn't have DT:Together), but when you
have someone else with you surviving its an epic experience! 

The game stays fresh because you usually find something new and interesting to do every time you play, like crafting something entirely new or making your base better etc.
Theres randomly generated maps and with them comes randomly some structures, huts etc. I think i haven't seen all of them yet but still, really cool touch

The artwork is really pretty, and personally i liked the fact that when some of the characters talk (for example, Wilson) 
You hear random screeching-kind words, thought that was pretty cool :D

There's alot of animals and enemies to discover, and some of them will help you survive
The designs of the mobs have been done pretty well and look really cool.
Theres ''bosses'' too, i don't know if thats the real name of them since there aren't like a special place where 
you can fight them, they just kinda appear

Only flaw i've really seen is that the fighting is kinda clumsy at times, maybe it can be improved somehow, this is my personal opinion though :) 

Overall, its a great game with huge world to explore and best played with friends! 
I would recommend this to almost every gamer :)

( My first ''real'' review, so its not perfect )
Brother gave me a copy for free
Bought game for husband so we can play together
He goes as Wilson I play as Wendy
Both doing well at first
I find a pet Chester for us
We build a cute little fort by the sea with a forest outside
One night we had a hand randomly reaching out from the sky
Succeeded in being freaked out
Husband starts to starve
I go scavenging for food for him
Husband freaking out
Realize he set the forest outside of camp on fire
He cant stop it
I come back in time for night to settle and try to help him
Fire is out of control
He was so focused on stopping the fire that he starved to death. 
We lost everything we built
I commit suicide by fire.

15/10 Would commit suicide again.
A ridiculously addicting & fun game.

Just know; 
Your friends are not your friends, this is survival. Either you starve, or they do.
Everything in this game hates you.
Bees hate you.
Hounds hate you.
Frogs hate you.
Pigs hate you.
Nature hates you.
Winter will laugh in your face as you suffer.

Don't slap the beehive, unless you have a character who can move at the speed of light.
If you slap a beehive & run to your friends, you will have tons of laughs as their hatred for you grows.

I rate this game 10 soggy carrots out of 10 soggy carrots.
I starved IRL while playing this game.
after 62 hours of attempts I finally survived 1 year in game. 
1 year = 71 Days
1 Day = 8 Minutes
8 X 71 = 568 Minutes
568 Minutes = 9 Hours 28 Minutes

Have fun with no Pauses. Gotta Stay effcient or die. 
Don't go AFK for more then 2 minutes or you will get killed by a frog or some sh*t

F*kin people knocking on my door F*k off m8 I've got no time to answer
Fire Alarms going off, the house is burning down keep going m8
Literally this game will kill you IRL if u get into a game.
The one thing Don't Starve was missing was co-op and for that reason alone this is definitely worth full price. Amazing fun can be had with friends on this, working together to survive winters, fight off hound attacks, explore further into the wilderness, etc.

A major plus is also the mod support. The person hosting the server subscribes to a mod, sometimes the players have to as well, and there are very few issues (and the issues are usually related to a single mod instead of compatibility issues).

My only complaint with Don't Starve also applies to this - there still is a significant frame rate drop the further you develop your base or whatever. Multiple farms, bee boxes, flowers, bees, butterflies on the screen in a very small vicinity halves the frame rate until you "leave" the area. The way around this though is better management of your base (i.e. building separate areas spread out for each whatever instead of EVERYTHING in a small space).

Still, incredible fun. If they didn't send out beta keys i'd instantly buy multiple copies and send them off to friends.
In world full of survival sandbox games, this one truly stands out.  Not only is food a constant issue, as the title would imply, but you'll be trying to keep your wits about you as you battle the elements and a lot of strange, and terrifying, creatures.

The Early Access deal/sale is definitely worth it if you have someone to play with.  Excellent for siblings, spouses, and even great for LAN parties.  It's really hard to put down once you get started.

Just plain fun.  Can't wait for full release version.
Pros
*Exceedingly high replayability*
*Fun Tim Burton-esque art*
*Multiplayer for suffering in groups*
*Random generation*
*likeable and unique character options*
*Fantastic mod support*
*Cosmetic character items given for playing.*
*Many functional strategies for survival based on your playstyle and preference*
*Difficult*

Cons
*Ever so slight delay between what you see and what is happening. Won't be noticable unless you played Original Don't Starve*
*Mob Hp is scaled up from original Don't Starve which sucks if solo*
*No pause button. would be nice if the host could pause it for everyone to take a pee break without time passing*
*Difficult*

This game is so good I spent my precious time telling you how good it is. I highly recommend.
Day 1: Built a fire
Day 2: Died in the darkness
Day 3: As a ghost, woke a tree guardian
Day 4: Friend brings me back to life
Day 5: Killed by tree guardian
Day 6: As a ghost, burnt down entire forest
Day 7: Friend went insane both in-game and irl

Today I lost a friend, but I didn't starve...
 This game is perfect to play with friends due to the amount of freedom one can have. It is really easy to host and set up a world. Anyone friend can hop in and learn by your example and advice. Even after you've reached the endgame content, you can set up a much harder world with tough settings, just to have constant challenges (I love playing Lights Out worlds).

Updates expand the lore of Don't Starve and make the game better and better. All microtransactions are cosmetic exclussively and cheap, this game deserves all the love it can get.
Started to play after dinner. Played. Died. Built a camp. Died. Built a camp with mods. Didn't die as much. Brought a friend in game. Both died. Built another camp. Living the life. Died again. 

Oh look, it's 5am.

Oh look, I played 38 hours.

Will die and build camps again. No regrets.

Highly recommended. Can't wait for more content.
+Absolutely the best co-op game (with friends) I ever played, it is better than L4Ds, better than Paydays
+Introduced this to my girlfriend (who is a non-gamer), and she was instantly hooked and developed a passion for Webber, so this is the best "plot to convert target girl into gamer" game
+This game reminds me of life and growing up. When you were a baby, everything is new to you. You have to explore and learn about the world you are in, so that you can live/survive better. As you play more, you will learn step by step, bit by bit, how to survive better, just like a baby growing up. This game is also here to unleash all your hidden childhood mischief that you always had, don't believe me? Just look at the number of people in the reviews killed by stealing Tallbird eggs!
+Best WTF Factor. Like to hear your friends say "What the XXXX" in many different musical tones, pitches and styles? You don't ever need to ask them anymore because this game does it automatically for you. I can assure you that seeing anything that looks bigger than themselves for the first time will produced the desired effect for your entertainment
I am just a new player. So far too good 11/10. This game pushed me to have a dedicated server and I learned how to use linux... Because of this game I got a server and because of this game I learned shell programming... Love don't starve together and love klei!...

If you are a new player, expect to play the game many hours to be really self-reliant bear grylls kinda guy . If you wanna go beyond bear grylls such as even starting to the game in summer or winter and if you wanna know every little detail about every item every mob etc, expect to play it alot. If you do not like playing many hours, dieing countless times to learn the game and if you don't like playing survival games, you should not touch to this game. You can go play other genres. It is a kind of trial and error game. You should learn by dieing, by reading articles in wikia and/or watching streams. Seems hard at first but everything is in details. There is no problem without an OP solution. If you know that detail you will likely survive or some situations may need taking many things into consideration. Surely having a base is cool but, if you want a challenge you should know that you don't need any base to survive in this game and it is pretty easy to do so (If you really know what you are doing).

Most of the mobs are one way or another hostile (well some neutral mobs are available but most of the neutral mobs got special times and they become hostile in those periods). So most mobs can be hostile towards you means that you can be curious about finding out what kind of mob but do not approach too close to experiment if you got no idea about the mob or if you got someone in the server you can ask info so you know what kinda mob is the one that you saw. Do not think that you are the only one who is not liked in the world. Some mobs are also hostile towards any other mobs including player etc so you can take advantage of these opportunities. Wanna fight? If you do not have any armor do not do that (only real pros with very good ping can fight without any armor)... You will be dead in mostly 3-4 hits because never forget that you are a paper tiger without an armor and kiting skills. Most importantly always at least have a torch to spend the night.

Good luck!
The bees will kill you.
The hounds will kill you.
The spiders will kill you.
The beefalos will kill you.
The darkness will kill you.
The penguins will kill you.
The bosses will kill you.
The cold will kill you.
The heat will kill you.
Starvation will kill you.
Insanity will kill you.

And you will give it another try.
Winter is bad. Decided to start game in Spring but went insane due to rain. Spring is bad. Decided to start game in Summer but spontaneously combusted and burned all of my chests. Summer is bad. Decided to start game in Autumn. Autumn is good. 10/10 would enjoy Autumn again.

[h1]INTRODUCTION[/h1]

I heard a lot of good stuff about Don't Starve Together, and I've watched some of my favorite YouTubers play the game. That's probably what drove me to buy it. My friend also happened to have Don't Starve Together, so we could play together. The game definitely isn't as much fun without friends, lemme tell ya.

So the game was fifteen dollars. It seemed like a pretty decent price, and I thought, "well, why the heck not?" So, to checkout I go. I had HIGH expectations, and I was worried that since I kind of knew about the game already, I would miss out on the experience of exploring it myself.

Haha... I'm laughing because I was an idiot.


[h1]WHAT DON'T STARVE TOGETHER IS[/h1]

Don't Starve Together has the amazing features of Don't Starve, except it's multiplayer and there's a different story. The art is dauntingly adorable. What do I mean by that? The art sets you into a world about survival and its dangers. I seriously love it. The type of art compliments the gameplay style perfectly, and it makes the game [i]that[/i] much more enjoyable.

You're thrown into an unforgiving world. There are tons of monsters, darkness that will swallow you whole, and lands that will try to kill you. But along with this sparks fascination. You have to survive in a crude world, learning along the way, picking up tips & tricks, and gathering tons of knowledge.

This is definitely my favorite survival game. It has greath depth, it's compelling, and extremely creative. The crafting aspect is fun, and exploring things is just simply enchanting.

The [b]purpose of Don't Starve Together[/b] is to play with friends, and I definitely recommend so. It's much more fun if you play with other people.

I usually recommend buying Don't Starve Together instead of Don't Starve, because in DST (Don't Starve Together) you can play both singleplayer and multiplayer. The only difference is the story. DST's story is a continuation of the original and classic Don't Starve. But honestly, the story isn't as important in my opinion, as the game can be a total sandbox and is much more valuable because it has multiplayer. It's meant more to be a sandbox type game, but the story can be important (it depends on the player).

If you're someone who doesn't play mutliplayer, then get Don't Starve. Otherwise I recommend Don't Starve Together. Even then, there are public servers you can join and play with other strangers.... totally trustworthy.

[h1]PLAYING[/h1]

I really, [i]really[/i] love this game. So far, I've played 130 hours in total. I wasted a lot of time. ([i]A lot[/i]). There's a lot to explore, and with 130 hours... I honestly haven't gotten into half the game yet! I know. I should've by now. But there's a seriously fun aspect with Don't Starve Together that won't let you drop it, and I'm surprised I haven't written this review sooner.

The great part is, there are tons of different mods created by the community that can impact your game. You should really get them. They're awesome, and yes, trustworthy. They're located in the workshop (in case you're wondering). And they seriously make your game much more fun. If you ever get the game and want to know what mods I recommend, please message in the comments below. There are lot of different mods, but there are some extremely important ones that make your game easier and more immersive.

Exploring was so much fun. The whole aspect reminds me of Stardew Valley, but to me there are a lot more things to discover in Don't Starve Together, and with friends it's amazing. You really shouldn't underestimate the game. It has a lot to offer, and is popular for a fantastic reason: it's purely great.

[i]"It's definitely a better game with friends. And it can be spooky & scary, especially if you don't know what's going on (rlly now?). I swear if you write this word for word-"[/i] - Quote from Kuep. 

^^^ He read it. [i]"You're a spaghetti-o-"[/i], he says.

Don't Starve Together is very unique, comedic, and fun overall. Much recommendation. I had a lot of moments where I died laughing, a lot of "WTF" moments, and honestly the game is a great excuse to have a good time with your friends. So if you wanna trick people into liking you, play this with them.

[h1]THE PROS[/h1]

- Adorable art. It fits the game perfectly, and you will love it's cuteness.

- Fun characters. Each default character has a backstory and unique personalities and weapons.

- Mods. Mods made by the community that makes your game extremely fun. You will love your life once you get them. Seriously.

- Exploration. Lots o' exploration. Lots o' fun. Enuff said.

- Challenge. The game offers challenges to those who like it, and even with normal gameplay you have to survive hunger and sanity. You can customize your settings to what you want on Don't Starve Together, and I really think that's fantastic.

- Uniqueness. It may have the classic but fun "survive" theme, but it has unique gameplay (you'll see what I mean if you buy it. Which you should.)

- Constantly updated. Constantly updated with new and old things from Don't Starve, and that's great. Games that don't update sometimes get boring, but with an alive workshop community and constant updates, that sure won't happen soon.

- Music. It's daunting. It's revving. It's themed perfectly. What more could you ask for?


[h1]THE CONS[/h1]

- Connection issues. Sometimes even though your wifi works on both ends servers get a little laggy, but it doesn't happen that much. Watch out if the person hosting the server has terrible wifi. You will hate them and your life.

- Imcompatible mods. This is not really a con, but it IS something you should be aware of. There are mods in the workshop that won't work with each other, and sometimes they will crash your game. This is annoying because if you subscribe to a lot of mods you have to go through each one to see which is crashing your game. For the most part, most mods are working fine. It's more of the, "ehhhh"-looking mods that don't work, (which is kind of obvious).

- Sometimes crashes. Sometimes Don't Starve Together has file issues and crashes your game. It happens rarely, but it is something to watch out for. No, none of these crashes deleted any of my progress, which is excellent. The game autosaves quite frequently. (Now that I think about it I've never had to save myself... Wait is there even a manual save button???)


[h1]PLACES TO IMPROVE[/h1]

- Crashes. Please fix file issues that occur randomly. A lot of users do have this, but as I said, it doesn't wipe any progress whatsoever.

- New biomes. I would love if there were new biomes. Something fascinating.

- New items. I would like new items. Once you play the game you realize there isn't that much diversity, but that's where mods come in! Hah. Still please make new items. <3


[h1]DON'T STARVE YOURSELF HESITATING TO BUY THE GAME (I'm bloody hilarious)[/h1]

It's fun as hell, and I had a lot of fun with this game. It is a game where you have to constantly look out for not dying, but there's [i]so[/i] much fun being chased to death by hounds. Trust me. It's a first-time experience. (I don't know if it is for you, though... o_o). And the fact that everyone is screaming that there's a gigantic black flea trying to chomp you (aka, the hounds) makes it all-the-while.

I want to stress about the art, because it really does fit well. I think it's perfectly suitable for the game, and it's extremely likeable as well.

This is a game I definitely recommend. A lot of fun, with challenges, and the great survival aspect I love. It's very original, and the characters are extremely comedic. The game can even be relaxing if you choose for it to be, or it can be freaking death chasing after you every split-second of your existence.

Credit to: Kuep for suggesting an important con and giving a quote!
I love this game so much that I'll try to write a poem, even tho I have zero experience and it'll probably sound horrible... also english is't my native language...
WHO CARES XD


Among the trees I wake up
A foreign World full of mysterious sounds
The Sun is just raising up
Only 8 days until I encounter my first hounds

A smile lies upon my lips
I found a nice spot to place my base
Tho I really need some tips
This annoying Tallbird won't stop his chase

Another moon is rising up in the sky
Killing some time with humming
Autuum ist ending, Winter is nigh 
I fear the Deerclops is coming

The cold bites deep into my flesh
I hear something like a loud breath?
The Deerclops doesn't care about my thresh
And that's the story about my first death.


...

Sooooooo... what i wanted to say is: I really love this game and I appreciate that after so long Klei still puts seasonal uptades und stuff on it. Many people whine about DS/DST because "it is too hard" or something like that (and I have to amit it really isn't easy) but isn't that the reason why most of us like it? Because we have to be carefull and think about what we are doing? Because of that overwhelming joy after defeating the Deerclops or after finding something you have never seen bevore even tho you have already 200 hrs on this game? Well... I won't stop playing anytime soon and I hope you are going to do the same :)

Have a nice day!
Awesome, and the best survival game.

You will find one great community, that will help you understand and how to get better in the game. One awesome workshop with tons of mods that will improve your gameplay and make different every time you play the game, if you want it  ofc.

The game itself have a great artwork, with a good soundtrack and the devs make constants updates.

So, if you are looking for a game to spend a good time, this is the one for you, but be aware, you will starve a lot, but at least you will not starve alone.


10/10, buy it :D
This is a fun co-op survival game, though game mechanics discourage larger servers. 

Dead players bring the 'sanity' of live players down, so on large servers (which are more likely to have a dead player at any given moment), your 'sanity' is threatened more often. Resurrecting dead players becomes a larger part of the game on these servers. 

Communication is much more important on large servers. With more players, the chance of running into a serious threat increases. Dealing with those threats sometimes requires a quick response and that is much harder to accomplish when there is no easy way to tell where teammates are short of clear and frequent communication.

On top of those challenges, having many players occupy the same bit of land leads to a greater chance of resource scarcity. On small servers, this isn't as much of an issue. On large servers, often vital resources have been picked dry when a new player joins the server, leaving them to face the night with no fire or weapon.

All of these problems can be addressed by the players with some forethought and planning, but these are issues unique to larger servers. If you play alone or with 1-2 other people, then the game is challenging without having to worry about these additional challenges. Of course, if you want a significantly greater challenge than what the single player or small server game offers, then a large server is for you. Aside from the disparity in difficulty between small and large servers, this game is everything you could want from a multiplayer experience of 'Don't Starve.' Everything that made the single player game great is here. If you ever get frustrated with the large server experience, then you can always dial it back down to a more manageable challenge.
For it to just be in beta right now, the early versions of DST are incredibly stable. Lets start out by listing the Pro and Cons

Pros
-Full mod support 
-Easy dedicated server hosting
-Drop in and out gameplay
-Basically the singleplayer release, but with your friends!
-It is a standalone game, so if your friends DO NOT own DS, you can send them a copy of DST and they will be able to play the game

Cons
-Servers can get really laggy after like 30 minutes of playing... However, the lag can be fixed with a simple restart of the server which takes like 2 minutes max
-This isn't really a con, I just dont understand it? There isnt a reason to own DS if someone buys you DST because you can play offline on DST

This game is a def buy for your friends or yourself, If you like DS, More than worth the money.
I've never said how much I love this game to death.  <3  My only real critique of Don't Starve Together are the mechanics of "together".  They are not nearly as brutal as the original game, by merit of having help.  It's still a grueling survival game, but on larger games it can get quite well established, to the point where most threats aren't even a concern.  The ghost mechanic is also a little annoying for when you're playing the game socially, and mostly want to just enjoy time with friends, since the optimal course of action for someone who is in ghost form, who can't immediately be ressurected, is to log out of the server.  But aside from these criticisms, I love both the core game and the multiplayer version.  Both are absolute favorites of mine, and continue to stay good, through DLC, keeping them fairly fresh.
The gameplay of Don't Starve will be very familiar to a seasoned player of survival games. Your main goal is to establish a base camp, gather items, and find a way to make your required resources (mainly food and heat) sustainable—all while avoiding the monsters that lurk in the dark. The added element of a sanity meter makes for an intriguing twist in gameplay that often requires the player to make less practical equipment (such as flower crowns) as well as the more obvious items (like farms).

As someone who's apparently unable to last more than six days without starving (or more likely being eaten by monsters in the dark), I had hoped that being able to play with a buddy might reduce my death count... in truth it's a lot harder to feed two people than it is to feed one! I found myself constantly out in the beefalo fields, gathering fertilizer only to run it back to my partner, eat a few carrots, and then run back out into the fields to gather even more poop while barely surviving.

Don't Starve is a fascinatingly challenging game with rich and diverse settings, an intriguingly vague story, spectacularly crafted sound effects, and a bevy of triumphs and heartaches for the casual player and the expert alike. It's made even more engaging (and difficult) with the addition of multiplayer.

Don't starve alone—starve together!
Don't Starve Together is an incredibly well polished Indie sandbox survival game. The game relies on player deduction and intuition - there are zero tutorials or handholding, you will die a plethora of generally reasonable and in hindsight easily avoidable ways. If you fail to learn from nor enjoy that sort of experience, then this is not the game for you. That being said, unlike 'Don't Starve' the more challenging single player game that spawned this iteration, when you die your world and progress doesn't 'generally' reset - since other players/means can easily revive you. The active player base is generally quite helpful to new players within reason. 

If you buy this game, do not think you are entitled to know/join an established base on a server without proving you are an asset and not a liability - or griefer first (Survive some days solo and gather resources to contribute!) The variety of things to do that often change seasonally or in the separate caves/ruins layer along with procedural generation keeps gameplay fresh and engaging. Most of the Early access issues (and there were a lot) have been fixed. 

Generally there is at least 1-2 bugfix updates every week, and with the free 'Through the ages' DLC being steadily implemented, content updates come out every month or so. On the whole, I recommend this game as a good way to make some friends, spend far more time of your life than intended in game feasting while ironically starving IRL, and of course - mostly having fun enjoying the many challenges DST offers!



This is one of those games where you will die over and over again. But that's okay, because that's how you learn to play. It's difficult learning the ropes, but it is rewarding. I've made so many friends through this game and I enjoy how Klei updates their game on a regular basis. Not everyone on here is nice, in fact you will meet many greifers which is probably the hardest challenge. I recommend you play this game if you like a simple (or complex)survival challenge, but DO NOT buy or play this until you have played Don't Starve(single player) or at least on a world by yourself so you get the hang of things.
This game.. THIS GAME

How ironic that the game I never thought I'd play would be the game I play the most

Many sleepless nights..
I love everything about this game: the backstory, characters, gameplay, co-op, graphics/artwork, music.. Everything is designed perfectly to fit each other

Heck I even made a youtube channel just for DST!

I have no dislikes whatsoever. The most perfect game I've ever played.


Also, I've never hated frogs this much in my life.. If you've played the game till Spring you know exactly what I mean
I highly recommend this game for anyone who wants to play with their friend. A little hard at first but I gets easier once you are used to it. However, the game mechanics will not make it too easy, even if you are a long time player.

Another note: 
Lag on this game is absolutely unbearable. Play with a stable network and preferably in close proximity to friends.
Don't Starve Together is a very atmospheric and inspiring survival game. It's narrative design is brilliant - from "instruments" voices to descriptions of crafted elements (can be quite unexpected!). 
Game mechanics and design are quite simple so you dig into the game very quickly and start exploring the world. 
But don't let this simplicity fool you because you will probably die a lot. 
And again afterwards. 
Aaand again. 
But it's cool.
 

As EA once infamously said: "the point of the game is to provide the player with a sense of accomplishment". They were wrong. That's the point of DST!

This game will frustrate you to no end. You'll love every minute of it, except for the last minute when you get wiped out. Or that minute your base is on fire and theres nothing you can do about it. Or that minute you are 10 screens from home without fuel for a fire because you're an idiot and left it at home. Or that minute you can see a berry bush in sight but then keel over from starvation. Or that minute a giant bear shows up and smashes everything that took you 5 hours to build. But you'll love all the other ones. Probably.

The game has a high risk/high reward play style. first Severeal times will be a confusion fest as there is no tutorial and you learn to survive through failure to do so. Every death teaches you what you might want to try differently next time. 

You'll be constantly stressed out on the default mode trying to prepare everything you need to survive your first summer/winter. And it feels epic when you do! Every time. In order to do it, though, you need to take some risks you're rarely totally prepared for: Kill a spider hive, attack some bees, hunt for those elusive gears you need to build that dang refrigerator. Do you hunt for food or gather wood you need to fuel a fire for days? Strategy depends entirely on the procedural randomized world and how you choose to create a strategy around what you find as you explore it. And your team's cohesion in executing it.

You can tweak the settings of the game world to make it as easy or as grueling as you want it to be. You can spend most of a game season preparing your base to survive winter only to have a lightning bolt or giant bear monster undo all your work in a horrible night. It's a rouge-like really so once everyone is dead; it's game over. It's painful to watch something you've invested in turn to dust! But that is what makes the game so rewarding and every minute so meaningful: is the knowledge that at any point a mistake could cost you the game. And when you make it day 300 it feels like you've earned it!

10/10

Survive together, kill spiders together, live with pig-men together, go insane together, become a beaver man together. There's no reason you shouldn't get this.

i think this game is hecka good https://discord.gg/ZMcubfc join this discord we're trying to get people to join, im sure we can setup a dedicated server for the game too :D hope to see u join
This is a fun game but also challinging to get use to. Its better off played with atleast on friend so you could split up the tasks and survive even longer.
My friend initially gave this to me so I could play with him and his buddies. I can confidently say I've bought 2-3 copies of the game so that I could have friends play with me. DST is such a fun game to play together.
An amazing game, the art style is unique and great, the lore is captivating and very mysterious, the soundtrack is really good, and the gameplay is very addicting. The game always gets you to strive to do better and to continue on every world you make, it becomes loads of fun which is amplified with friends who make the gameplay 100% better.
Do you have friends? Do you want to be isolated from your friends? Well look no further cause this is the game for you! Run wildly around, eating some weird berries and capturing rabbits, or even stomp on a few shadow hands that steal your fire. If you don't have fire, well your are well fucked good sir. 10/10
Great game with lots of possibilities, can play with friends and has a very dark feel to it, it's not exactly easy but it's thoroughly enjoyable and takes a lot of teamwork to stay alive, would recommend to anyone who likes a good survival game.
Don't let the tittle mislead you, hunger is going to be the least of your worries after a few playtroughs. But, if you ever die [spoiler]and you will.[/spoiler] There's always the relief of knowing that you'll always die, doing something that you loved.
Artstyle simply amazing, but it has some problems, the main one, being the lack of a main objective to do (as the game tells you, its to don't starve, aka remain alive, but it doesnt feel ok), also the game doesn't teach you well all it's mechanics, so if you really want to learn to play the game to have fun, you gotta use outside resourses. Also feels really grindy and a little rng dependent on spawns, idk if the feeling goes away when you git gud at the game, but I didn't stay for long to know that. The only reason I'm rating this game as good, it's cause the online with friends can be really good, so, if you wanna have fun for a while, this is good, always that you don't take the game too seriously.

Really good game 5/7 imo
I really wish i could recommend this game, I've had so much fun playing it. But as someone who gets bored over time I just cant. Don't get me wrong this game is great, but the amount of updates they add just aren't enough. I'm not talking about the limited time events though, the events are great. But if the only reason people are excited to play is for the limited events and not the actual game than I think the game might not be that great. They update this game VERY rarely, it's almost like if you take away the events than it'e been the same thing for a whole year... oh wait, it has.
No option to SERIOUSLY PAUSE the game.  Life happens, the real world needs my attention, and not being able to pause makes this game borderline unplayable.
“Ultimately we felt Warbucks was both culturally problematic and not also very interesting to play so we decided to start over. We understand some people may like aspects of him, and perhaps we will bring some of those aspects back one day. In the meantime, we’ve decided to move on. 

“In general, we throw away a lot of our work in order to make something we’re happy with, but generally that’s before it gets released even in Beta. […]”

Never lick at SJW. Social justice warrior - not your main buyers - a white male in the Victorian era is not culturally problematic, remember that.
This game is not alot of fun.
You can't play it with friends splitscreen which sucks....
Its also very difficult which makes it only fun to play with a friend who is good in gaming but then it isn't fun.
The Developer Klei has recently removed a character named Warbucks in their upcoming game Dont Starve Hamlet for being a colonizer which they consider problematic. And yet they are still advertising him on their videos. I believe a company like that is not worth doing business with no matter the quality of their games. Its important for buyers of this game to know this is the type of company they are giving their hard earned money to. I believed this game (the original Dont Starve Together) to be moderately fun and yet I regret buying due to the aforementioned reasons. And for that I must give this game, this company, and their political agenda a big thumbs down. I will not be helping them spread their propaganda with my hard earned money ever again.
Posted February 9.
it's okay. the game is definitely not worth £11 though,, it gets boring over time, even online. i played singleplayer for around 40 minutes, got bored, so i tried multiplayer with some friends, but it didn't give a fresh experience.
honestly, i was expecting more from this! but i guess it's just not my type of game.

i wouldn't buy it if i knew this. your preference!
Difficult. This game is rated that positively that I was quite amazed by its shallowness.  
It's definitely too boring for me, for someone who is used to 7 Days to Die, The Forest and co.  
Don't Starve Together is about survival apparently, but it just feels super simple. With no real depth.   
Maybe I did not get it. But I had to refund it.
