[h1]The Guide[/h1]
I will put the main part of this review into a steam guide, the foremost reason is, that there is far too much I want to talk about.
To justify making it a guide-review, I will put a lot of reference to it and go into more detail, so I hope you can accept my decision and enjoy it regardless.

[h1]The Verdict[/h1]
The game is designed to be pure fun for everybody and it achieves this goal with flying marks.
A definite recommendation for just about anyone coming by, trust me that you can have fun without investing a ton of time.
Just mind that it's a big online game and like any other of the size, it attracts trolls, plain idiots and other sorts of human scum, so do yourself a favor and disable voice and maybe text chat in the options and you are good to go.
 
[h1]Note[/h1]
If you have read this far - [b]thank you[/b].
I hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.
Rocket League is a perfect game for short breaks. 5 minutes of flying and exploding cars, then I can continue doing whatever I was doing before. (To be honest, it usually ends up in "one more match" multiple times. That's how it's good.)

The game is easy to learn and just fun to play. Making the perfect aerial shot, passing to a goal, saving the ball from reaching your goal at the last possible moment, failing hard and scoring an own goal... These are all moments you will see in Rocket League.

Are you in a mood for tactical game? Play 2v2. Do you want chaos? Play 4v4.

I love car customization. Who doesn't want to have a car with sombrero and rainbow trail?

So, what makes this vehicular football game so great?

- Great gameplay
- Marvelous graphics
- Very competitive
- Alright singleplayer
- Tons of customization
- Easy to pick up, hard to master
- Up to 4-player splitscreen (!!)
- Cross-platform
+ Much more to experience for yourself!

Cons:
- Servers were pretty bad to begin with, but that's fixed now tho', so this should not count as a con.

Everything else that I would have written as a con, is currently being added, so I have no complaints about this game at all.

''Just one more game'' - everyone.
Rocket League is less of a "sports game" and more of an actual sport. In FIFA or Madden you have a "pass" button, but to make a pass in Rocket League you have to drive your car into the ball at the right speed and angle to send it over to where your teammate is going. You have to create the pass yourself, and it can be anything, from a hard bounce off the back wall to a soft lob over the defender. 

Passing, shooting, dribbling, tackles, jukes, they're all in the game, but you  have to make them happen yourself, not just press the right button. At first, just driving car to ball is a challenge, but as your skill grows, the freedom to create any play you can imagine and execute is unlike anything you'll find in a "sports game". Together with the mechanical skill to do what you want with the ball, you'll have to develop positional awareness and learn proper rotation and game sense. 

There are very few games that are consistently rewarding for hundreds or thousands of hours, that can keep challenging you as you improve, and improve, and improve beyond what you ever imagined you'd be capable of. In fact, this is the ONLY one I know. 

Best.

Game.

Ever.
When you buy this game, it will take about 20-30 hours to actually start hitting balls. By 100-150 hours, you'll be flying around the map to score some crazy looking goals (in your opinion). But then, that's when the fun actually begins: mastering the basic moves of the game is basically mastering 1% of what you can do in this game. You'll end up playing more and more and more, until you realize you've just spent three hours in practice hitting the same shot again and again. Yes, this game is higly addictive. My favorite game ever without any doubts.
[b]Rocket League has one of the best progression systems I've ever seen in a video game before...[/b]

[b]Rookie[/b] - You can't hit shit. You are a disgrace to your team and the game.

[b]Semi Pro[/b] - You can now sometimes hit the ball. Don't even try to hit it in the right direction or think about your positioning. You're only Semi Pro so you can just go ahead and hit that ball! You also made a bicycle hit that one time but yeah nah you're still shit.

[b]Pro[/b] - You have learnt how to shoot the ball accurately from the ground. You're the best! Late into Pro level, you would have likely looked up advanced tips for Rocket League. Worst mistake of your life. You now know what aerials are. You think you can fly. The ball comes up high and you go for an aerial. Once you jump, you fly straight into the ground and continue to do frontflips until you land on your back... What the fuck happened there? Oh. You're using keyboard. Yeah nah, time to get a controller, dick-head.

[b]Veteran[/b] - You now have a controller and go for terribly unlikely aerials. You think you're good. You can hit the lower aerials consistently and you can now be considered an addition to your team. Congratulations!

[b]Expert[/b] - You can now consistently hit aerials accurately at any height. This game is now your life. You can also score off a wall every now and then. Good times.

[b]Master[/b] - You are now a god to every level lower than you. You have perfected the art of wall shots. You are an extremely cool person. A nice little bonus is that everyone under the level of Pro will now spam "Sorry!" every time they do something wrong to you.

[b]Legend[/b] - The most badass-looking title you can have. Fuck Rocketeer. You probably now have an extreme case of false confidence. Once you get used to the badass title, you'll wreck anything and anyone with ease. You can also pull off freestyles consistently. Nice job! Also be sure to prepare for an endless stream of "You're not good enough for Legend!"

[b]Rocketeer[/b] - You can now 720-freestyle-backflip-reverse-backwards-aerial-air dribble off a wall with ease. You probably boosted for that Rocketeer tag. But if you didn't, still prepare for another endless stream of "You're not good enough for Rocketeer!"

But in all seriousness, I absolutely love this game and I'm sure anyone will. I've literally never seen someone dislike this game after they've played 10 hours. (Rocket League moves onto a whole-nother level of fun and addiction once you learn how to fly.)

If you're still contemplating buying this game after reading this review, just trust me when I say it is one of the most fun and addictive games I've ever played (more gripping than Skyrim and GTA). 
Think about it this way: You wouldn't have made it this far through the review if you didn't secretly want this game. Ignore the childish-looking pictures on the store page. Just get this game. This is the one.

[h1]EDIT - 2/13/2016:[/h1] You know a game is amazing when the servers go down and you'd rather train offline than play any of your other 100 games... 

ty for the read
Please bring back casual rumble!
- In comp, there is so much hate. They hate me when I do a mistake. They hate me when they do a mistake. They hate me when I touch the ball. They hate me when I don't touch the ball. They hate me when the opponents have three plungers and I got the tornado. 

- In casual, they usually just spammed what a save, slammed their controller in the wall and left the game. Then they got replaced by a lovely bot named Squall, who never complained about anything. He just kept fighting. I love Squall. Squall also wants casual rumble back.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
Rocket League is an amazing game. You know those games that you play while you should be going to bed? That's this game. Only 90 minutes into the game, and i've already had so much fun with it. I would honestly reccomend this game to anyone. Unless you REALLY hate soccer, and you simultaneously REALLY hate cars.

10/10
This is a great game. It will take a long time before you are good, then after you play a while after that, you'll realize you are actually stil trash. This cycle repeats several times.
500+ hours in and still finding new things to learn.

Easy game to pickup, stupidly hard to master.

Can't recomend this game enough.

Nice shot! What a save!
Why is this game so good. Its just soccer with RC cars. I don't even like soccer. Hell I don't even really like RC cars. But then I do a sick backflip and block a goal and I feel like a god damn winner.

So play this game, and feel like a winner.
Three years later is still my most played steam game.
Replay value is almost infinite. The higher you get in the ladder, the more you realize how little control of the mechanics you really have. 

Fast gameplay, crazy close games. 
Rocket league is the game for those who want to test themselves. 

I'd recommend you jumping in with a different mindset from your others games. There will be frustration, teammates will ruin your games as you will from time to time as well. 

Rocket league its not one of those "easy to pick up, hard to master games" the game is hard. Is hard to drive straight, is hard to dribble, is hard to aerial and to anticipate, is hard to hit angled shots and to put goals on the net.

But... That's exactly why Rocket League is so fun. It rewards your grinding and your effort in a way no other game does.

To quote the Rocket Pass "How far will you go?"
If you're even just slightly interested in arcade racing games and/or football, then you should check this out...well, actually, even if you're not ;)

In Rocket League, you're playing football (or soccer) with cars, with the addition that you have a speed booster and you can jump, which can make for some great moves and aerial shots.
You can choose from 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 or 4v4 Matches, so it's nowhere near as much players as in real football, but that's actually a good thing, even with 4v4 it can get pretty messy and chaotic...then again, that can be fun as well ^^

It's rather easy to get into the game, as you have tutorial for the basics, like handling your booster, doing aerial shots, defense etc. But that doesn't mean there is no challenge. To do those insane aerial maneuvers, you'll need quite some training.

The Main Motivation comes from being a competitive game, either via ranked games or normal matches against other players. There is also a single-player mode, but that's more for practicing and getting into the game than a selling point for the game.
You can also unlock stuff for your car, like hats, booster color, tires and patterns to put onto your car.

I've never been a big fan of either genre, yet Rocket League manages to pull me in and gets me excited about every match i play. Even if you're playing with random people, it's not that bad and you can have quite some fun, though having a good team which is working good together would be the most fun.

So, hope to see some of you on the field :)
You know a game is good when it's the last thing you think about at night and the first thing you want to do in the morning.

Rocket League made me forget to masturbate.

10/10
Sooo... Rocket League was out for a long time - steam had been trying to get me to buy it through numerous sales and recommendations based on similar games. I put it off again and again, despite friends telling me that this game is amazing/unbelievable. I scoffed when I saw RL esports on BTsports one saturday morning as I skipped through the channels on my TV, what a joke I thought. football with cars...it sounds stupid.

I can tell you now, I am an idiot for not listening to everyone. This game is amazing. I don't think there is another game that I have played that so consistently gets you pumped. There is a degree of toxicity in the game caused by the fact that everyone seems to think they are the next Kronovi/Squishy. it is such a simple game but at the same time there is so much complxity to it.

In it's simplest form the aim of the game is to get the ball into the other teams goal; here are the controls. accelerate, brake/reverse, jump and boost. You play a few games and think yeah this is alright. Then someone "pro" will join your game and air dribble the ball over your head into goal or a skilled team will pass the ball from goal to scoring without the ball touching the ground. Because you are new you are just like....."wtf just happened" and it's at that moment you realise...the cars have wings(if you have the skill to control it.) and the boost isn't just to get you around on the ground quicky. You'll give it a bash, the ball will sail through the air you jump, you boost, you fail on an epic scale. Now you get spammed with "what a save!" because your lack of ability was clearly apparent and your team mates are more than happy to point out who is exactly to blame for any and all mistakes. 

To sum up, I think Rocket League might be the best game I have ever played, once you've got past the steep and seemingly never ending learning curve and start making amazing team plays you will understand what I mean. It's even good as a spectater sport. like I said I scoffed when I saw it on BTsports. Now I watch most of the RLCS on Twitch.

Buy this game, you will not be disappointed....for me this is a 10/10 - remember its a team game sometimes a pass is better than a shot!

Pro tip - stay out of ranked until you can hit at a minimum 100% on all star goalie training and 50% on earial all star training(they seem boring but honestly it is basic training that gives you a feel for controlling your car in the air and you will benefit from the mucle memory in matches)
Pros:

+ fast and uncomplicated 
+ easy to learn hard to master
+ 1v1 up to 4v4 matches
+ competitive mode
+ different and pretty maps
+ decent graphics

Cons:

- a lof of potato players

IF you've never played Rocket League, like many other good games you're probably going to be dog shit when you first start. You'll first join the tutorial and start touching the ball, yea it feels good we know. Then you decide you'll give online a go, REAllY see what this bitch is about. You're first game online you get 2 clears and a center ball, pretty raunchy. You decide to tax yourself on another game and press rematch. You give a great pass to your team mate, wou lose 1-2. You continue to play online even though you have no idea what the fuck you're doing but for some reason you can't stop playing it. Then you start to progress and get better and learn to manipulate the car and the ball in ways you've never seen, and fly(Did I mention you could fucking fly). You then start to forget about where you came from and whether or not you even liked the damn game to begin with. You slowly then being training every day before work or school, practicing aerials and dribbling in free play mode. The ball slowly becomes a part of you. You become the rank of "Pro" and you're feeling pretty damn hot right now shit, even scalding. You slowly climb the ranks and descend into the madness that is rocket league. Then the itch starts. You'll be at work or out running errands thinking about how much better time could be spent playing rocket league. When you see a subaru on the road, it's not a subaru to you anymore it's now a Takumi. When you go to bed you dream of Rocket League. Now we go back to the original question of whether or not you would like this game? You'll fucking love it, too much. The developers, Psyonix, are incredibly good at listening to what the community wants. Each update they continue to push out more and more content and the game is growing everyday. So many funny options to decorate and customize your cars, from toppers to antennas. You can unlock items in game and craft rarer, more exclusive items from those. You dont have to good at rocket league to like it, you just have to be better at having fun. I have made so many memories off this $20 purchase. Like how the hell are they only charging $20 for this game its incredible. I Have put more time and heart into this game on PC and Xbox then any of the main AAA titles that I used to play, and I probably won't stop. Buy this game. Play this game. Love this game. 

Papa Johns.
Rocket League is one of my favorite games.  Why?


The game's system is the best that i can imagine. Your advantage over other players isn't measured by how many hours you have, how many dlcs you got, or your level. It's measured by how much you've learned and perfected.

You start as a derp car that can't hit a ball 20ft above the ground. Then you keep playing against people of the same skill, until you see someone who can do some cool/pro/funky/op stuff, then you see his goals and you think: "Wow, look at that shot, i must learn how to do it!"        
      Then in a matter of time, you learn how to do it and even do better. One step closer to become a Rocketeer.                  
                                                       some more training and you can hit the ball wherever it is.
                                                    even more and you can aim the ball wherever you want.

The controls are great, comfortable and very easy to learn. If you use a controller, you will not have an advantage against who uses a keyboard and vice-versa.

The graphics are nice, you can play it with a microwave using low graphics, or a medium computer on max graphics with a solid 60 fps. They could be better though (?)

The levels normally represent your skill very well if you aren't a lot above-average or below-average, with a Rookie playing like a rookie and a legend playing like a legend. (The level "Pro" is just wrong, you probably aren't pro yet if you are there)

The matchmaker does its job well. Rather than your level, it takes your "skill" in consideration, so you will often play with people only slightly better or worse than you. This isn't bad, it is actually very good for you to learn and get better.

Can i say anything more?
NO item in the game gives you advantage over other player, all cars have the same speed and the only thing that changes is the hitbox, not a big deal when you learn the controls. The DLCs don't make you better or anything, too.
OK first of all its a shame that most negative reviews are based on first 2 days after release where the team of devs had some problems with the servers. They worked day an night and now everything is working fine at least for me.

So, i played this game on Beta on PS4 and i was pretty hyped about the launch. It didn't disapoint. I have it for free on PS4 and bought it on steam to play with friends.

The game is a ton of fun. The gameplay is easy to learn, hard to master.
Graphics are pretty nice and cars come with a ton of costumization options (FOR FREE).
We can face AI opponents with diferente skill levels (that can make a huge diference) or we can play vs players usually with simillar skill (sometimes u can face players really better than u but their in game rate is the same or lower than yours).
There are several game modes but the only major difference is the amount of players and ranked match or not.
Its great to play with friends. Hard to quit playing even if you're really tired.
I seriously recomend using a controller. I use my DS4 with Bluetooth (using inputmapper) and it works perfectly. For ppl using other controllers i recomend x360ce (helped 2 friend who were using a ds2 and a sega saturn controller).

A word also for the devs that seem to work night and day to fix problems. Keep up the  good work.

Great game. One of the better for sure to release this year.
[h1]Introduction[/h1]
I've often found myself with little pockets of time in which I've wondered, "What should I do now?". You know, those moments in time where you have too little time to play a really lengthy, story-driven game (or League of Legends), but way more time than you can feasibly sit and idle. It's as if our prayers were collectively answered with this fantastic game from Psyonix; Rocket League.

Take out your controllers boys & girls, we're playing football....with cars.

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
I've been playing games like Fifa and PES from the glory '98 days, but eventually my interests changed. After all, it was simply a game of football. There is only so much you can do with human players. Apparently Psyonix thought outside of the box. What they delivered was simply a stroke of genius. Gone were the human players we were accustomed to. Instead, rocket-powered cars jetted their way across the map in record speeds. This wasn't enough though. They altered the map, super-sized the ball, and set each player in control of only one car at a time.

This formula gave birth to the high-intensity game of Rocket League. Your goal is to hit the massive ball into the opponent's goal. Sounds simple enough right? Wrong. With rocket jumps, speed boosts, rocket-propelled flight and the unique map shapes, you'll find yourself in an endless chase at breakneck speed for possession of the ball. While this game is absolutely beginner friendly, it has an insanely high skill-ceiling. In other words, no matter how good you think you are, there is someone who is leagues above you.

Each team can have up to 5 players, though the 3v3 format is the standard mode, and has a nice balance between chaos and fun. The potential teamwork between players is definiely one of my favourite aspects, and promotes friendly behavior for those epic goals. Don't be surprised if you get called out for accidentally hitting the ball away from the opponent's goal, or worse, hitting it into your own.

Quick-chat commands are rather peaceful, but after seeing 3 censored swear words, you'll probably get the idea. The sarcastic tones of "What a Save!" upon scoring a goal always gives me a chuckle, and the genuine compliments from opponents is a welcome breath of fresh air, and pride.

Car selection & customization should probably be a mini-game on its own. With a wide variety of colours, hats, boost trails and decals to choose from, you'll likely have more than a few saved presets that you'll cycle through. With an ever-growing roster of cars and cosmetics, there's plenty to appeal to everyone.

Speaking of appeal, there's much more than your classic game of football in Rocket League. Games such as basketball and hockey have found their way into the ever-growing list of game modes, and I often find myself cycling through them all quite frequently. Hell, even my 5 year old cousin loves it. Think you've got the skills to make it higher? You'll be happy to test your skills in the competitive mode. To be honest, I haven't really played much of this, since I prefer the other modes so much more.

[h1]Visuals[/h1]
Don't let its colourful nature confuse you, rocket league is one beautiful & optimized game. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how easy it was to run on even some old potatoes, and its ability to be quite visually appealing on higher settings. The explosions and particle effects are both colourful and beautiful. The cars are nicely detailed, and the animations are right on point. 

[h1]Audio[/h1]
If you for some reason haven't listened to Rocket League's soundtrack, get it...now. I find myself upset that it's not on by default while playing, but there are plenty of workarounds to really listen and enjoy the music all year round. The tracks are entertaining and insanely high quality. 

Soundtrack aside, the regular SFX are no less impressive. Vehicle sounds, explosions, and the 'fake crowd' cheering are just a few of the many things this game has to offer for your audiophile needs.

[h1]Summary & Conclusion[/h1]
Whether you've got only 5 minutes to spare, or an entire afternoon, Rocket League offers hours of addictive fun that never seems to grow old. This unique spin on a timeless sport is sure to appeal to a very wide audience, and you can be sure that your experience is likely gonna be a great one.

For $20, this game is worth full price, but you can always get it on sale pretty often.
I rarely grant this one but,

10/10 - Just simply fun, addicting and worth every penny.

Props to the devs for showing that an independent team could release such a big hit without submitting to the horrible DLC practices of modern gaming.

Haven't had this much fun playing a video game in ages! 
Easy to learn and very hard to master but it is well worth it.
Still playing! Keep practicing and you will improve! Also change
default camera settings FOV to at least 100 :) 90 is poo.
This game will seem frustrating for probably 99% of new players, but after putting the time in, it's proven itself to be the most exciting game I've ever played. The creativity you get to test is on levels way above any other competitive game and for this it feels like every game is unique, unlike in other games (that I have also put many hours into), in which it feels like games can get repetitive and sometimes boring. Don't get me wrong, the game has it's flaws, and it can sometimes feel like you've lost games due to unprecedented levels of luck for your opponents, but no game is perfect and often it's unnoticed when the luck swings your way. 

After going to #Landon and experiencing the atmosphere in a stadium with thousands of people, watching the greatest pro games I think many of us players will ever see, I think it's safe to say that my love for this game will never truly die.
Fast-paced game where cars play [strike]football[/strike] [b]carball[/b]. A great concept backed up by its great gameplay!

Everything on this game is just spot on; The steering, the map sizes, the game lenghts, where the boosts are placed at...
This game has also alot content to unlock. There are no real advantanges what car you are using, except some cars have a bit tinier or larger hit box. I honestly like this, because I can use the car for the looks and not for the advantage.

No matter if you play mostly FPS games, MOBA, mmorpg etc. this game will be perfect for you. I can honestly recommend this game for EVERYONE. I am pretty sure that I will spend hundreds of hours on this game.
Buy this game, you wont regret it.

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Rocket League is the perfect example of a simple idea executed the correct way. It doesn’t need complex progression or diverse player choices to keep it fun, it’s just fun as it is. You’ve got fast rocket-powered cars that can jump or fly around and you use them to knock a ball into your opponent’s goal. That’s all there is to the core gamemode. It is so rare these days that a game with an idea this basic actually ends up being a fully fledged successful title. Rocket League is a great change of pace and it has earned a lot of respect from me. 

Rocket League’s main gamemode “Soccar”, as Psyonix likes to call it, is certainly a simple idea that anyone can get into, but it is in no way easy. The controls in this game are easy to learn, they work well and are fluid, but learning how to properly maneuver your vehicle in order to hit a moving ball at the right angle to get it to go where you want is another story entirely. If you’re playing Rocket League you’ve likely played other racing games and understand the basics, but controlling a car in this manner is an incredibly unique experience. Even people who have hundreds of hours in ranked played still fail to properly control their car, especially as they’re flying through the air. It is definitely a game that encompasses the idea of easy to learn, hard to master. 

While the standard Soccar gamemode is certainly the most well known and commonly played, it isn’t actually the only thing Rocket League has to offer. First I should note that Soccar does have some slight variants including 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, as well as ranked versions of each. The game has always had a solid competitive scene, so if that’s your thing this is a good place for it. There are sorts of other less “serious” gamemodes as well. As Psyonix comes up with more fun things to do with rocket cars, I’m sure we’ll see even more added or rotated in. Currently there are Hockey and Basketball modes, which play much like how you’d imagine they would with fast cars. There is also a chaotic 4v4 Soccar mode and a mode revolving around cooldown based powerups that can do crazy things like teleport switching with an enemy, or summoning a tornado to toss the ball and other cars around. 

[h1]Gameplay[/h1]
Rocket League is a fast-paced sports/racing game where quick reactions and planning are essential. Personally, I am not a big fan of most racing games and practically no sports games, however Rocket League really earns its own unique place around those genres. I would highly recommend just checking out a video or two from professional Rocket League tournaments, it should be quick to notice how some people are so passionate about playing and watching this game. 

If you’re not the competitive type, Rocket League still certainly has plenty to offer you. Either playing with friends in casual matches or privates matches against one another is an immense amount of fun. That can be said about many games, but you aren’t going to find another game like this out there right now. It should also be noted that this is one of the few games out there that supports cross-platform matchmaking and parties. This has been the case to some degree for a long time, but just recently Sony finally loosened up on their terms for crossplay which means RL matchmaking is able to pool together players from every system.

[h1]Graphics[/h1]
The arenas in which you play in are all relatively small, this is not an open world game. For this reason, they are able to implement absolutely gorgeous arenas and backdrops while still maintaining very good performance across most computers. As time goes on Psyonix continues to add more beautifully themed maps, all of which essentially play out the same, but add some pleasant variety that make each match just that much more interesting. The maps aren’t the only beautiful thing, they certainly didn’t want their rocket cars to get jealous of their environment. All the different cars  perform practically the same, with only some slight difference in hitbox and handling. However there are such a wide amount of options that most anyone should be able to find one that they love to look at. There are many free or paid cosmetic options for car bodies, wheels, cute hats, or even things like boost trails or goal explosions!

[h1]User Interface[/h1]
The UI is as sleek and sexy as the rest of the game. Psyonix continues to make improvements to it, but it has always been very well designed. It’s easy and fast to get into whichever kind of match you’d like. You can see news and patch notes ingame, and also easily see which song the ingame playlist is currently on. 

[h1]Controls[/h1]
I believe most people would prefer to play this with a controller, and that’s surely what it’s mainly designed for. However, I have always played on Mouse and Keyboard and I’ve never felt the controls to be awkward or difficult. Everything is easily rebindable as well on either control scheme. 

[h1]Audio[/h1]
Car engines roaring, crowds cheering, goal horns blaring, what’s not to love? All of the expected sound effects of a rocket powered soccer game are here, and they are quite satisfying. There are even some options for different engine or boost sounds for your car. 

Most of the music of Rocket League consists of EDM and other fast paced electronic style music, which is very fitting for the aesthetic of the game. The game has some solid original songs, as well as an increasingly large amount of options from other indie groups that fit into the game equally as well. In 2017 Monstercat also partnered with Psyonix allowing Rocket League to feature their new songs ingame via their very convenient “Rocket League Radio”.

[h1]Final Thoughts[/h1]
Rocket League is a game as much as it is a show. The style and implementation of the game allows for it to be a very strong esport due to the high skill ceiling and the excitement of watching it. As competitive as it gets, it also has plenty of fun to be had for even the most casual gamers out there. It’s an incredibly unique game, and really stands alone outside of games from similar genres. This is the type of game that really will just come to someone’s personal preference of whether they will play it or not. It isn’t held back in any way by performance, or catering to only a specific audience, it’s truly a game I believe that anybody can love.

EDIT 29 / DECEMBER / 2016: I did some changes thanks to the feedbacks in the comments, thanks guys!
Rocket League is a vehicle based football game developed by Psyonix. In Rocket League you get behind the wheel of one of a number of different cars and face off against up to 4 opponents in an effort to hit a giant football in to the opposing team's goal. Enjoyable in solo play, local multiplayer and online matchmaking you can either play 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 and even unbalanced matches! (only available in offline exhibition mode).

+Great graphics and visual effects
+A wide range of customisation options unlocked as you complete matches
+There's a season mode if you wish to play solo so you don't have to just play exhibition games repeatedly, the season mode is actually pretty good and features a number of different options which make it more interesting
+Local multiplayer supports up to four players (providing you have enough controllers)
+A number of different maps, each with several time and weather variations
+Cross-platform multiplayer with PS4 players (though the party system currently doesn't work when doing cross-platform matches)
+Rocket League features some quick messages which get assigned to your controller's hat switch allowing you to communicate quickly with your teammates
+You can save the replays of your matches to watch back later
+Obviously it has full controller support for 360 controllers as well as Xbox One controllers and the controls are fantastic
+It's even entertaining for those of us who aren't keen on playing sports games
+Your car's top speed is considerably higher on a pitch made of tarmac compared to a grass pitch, it's not a major feature but it's certainly a nice touch
+As mentioned earlier you can play unbalanced matches when playing offline exhibition, they provide and extra layer of challenge and are great fun when playing local multiplayer

+/-The game's bots aren't great but this game is best enjoyed by playing multiplayer anyway

-Solo play gets pretty repetitive

Verdict:
An Essential Purchase (9.5/10)

Rocket League is an incredibly good multiplayer game with great visuals, lots of customisation options and a number of different maps. If you're looking for a new multiplayer game or just something a bit different, you've come to the right place.

[i]No drama, [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/justreviews]Just Reviews.[/url][/i]

For the amount of people that tell me, "I'm not treally into video games..", and then proceed to not wanna stop playing....

You should try this.  

It's a great concept that has been made to work wonderfully.  Anyone can enjoy it, and many will fall in love.
Silly quirky game that you can play with your friends until you realise the depth to the game and invest thousands of hours of your life into getting better at car football. Each time you hit a milestone rank, you end up playing the game even more. Eventually you hit Grand Champ and realise that you are stuck in a never ending journey to keep getting better and one day inevitably become Squishy. And I wouldn't have it any other way. 10/10.
I received Rocket League from a friend who swore by it that it was fun and addicting. 
Following that, I proceeded to play with him and some other friends; but we sucked...bad.

900+ logged hours later....

I am in the top 1% of all players in ranked and am addicted to this game!
--------------------------------------
Rocket league is a game that you can pickup for the first time and be terrible at, but have that feeling that if you fixed a few things, or made a few different moves, you could have done much much better. It is a fast paced game where:
-The idea of the game is simple
-The controls are exceptional! (For real, the cars all react to your controls exactly how you think they should.)
-The skill cap is insanely high
-Every single time the ball goes in the air, you feel like it is possible to make an insane goal off of it

Rocket league is the type of game that I can pickup for a few games and put back down, or I can just delve deep into an 8 hour session and keep trying to rank up and fix my mistakes I had last game.
------------------------------------
Psyonix (The developer) knows how to run this game. They are constantly pushing out new updates, patches, and content; most of which is free!
They allow you to customize your vehicles, so no two are the same. Or you and some friends can team up, create the exact same cars, then be a three man wrecking crew of flying vans!
Psyonix really thought of everything with Rocket league, and they keep adding more and more great content!
------------------------------------
All-in-all, Rocket league is a great game, cannot recommend it enough, and is totally worth even up to a price of $60! 
(Even though I got it for free!)

So have fun in rocket league, work your way to the top, and...
Calculated.
Calculated.
Calculated.
I have pumped 1300 hours of my life into this game and created a lot of great memories playing with friends. It's rough to get started but so satisfying and exciting once you get the hang of it..... and here I am 1300 hours in still being dunked on and called a trash noob. Great game 10/10. Nice one!
I hate multiplayer, but I love Rocket League.
I hate soccer/football, but I love Rocket League.
I hate racing games/kart racers, but I love Rocket League.
I hate sports games, but I love Rocket League.


None of this makes senses, but Rocket League is the most fun I've had in years.
First 20 hours playing the game - "Oh nothing like having some innocent fun playing car soccer!"

100 hours logged - "Hey I did a cool little aerial and scored, I gotta save that replay!"

Almost 900 hours logged and reached Champion Rank - "EVERYONE IS FLYING AROUND, THE CARS HAVE TURNED INTO PLANES, BOOST HAS THE SAME VALUE AS MOON ROCKS, AND THE BALL NEVER TOUCHES THE FUCKING GROUND"

10/10 will continue to play car soccer

What can I say?  3 years and 1500+ hours of playtime after its release... something I always come back to... something with an incredibly high skill-ceiling if you're willing to master the fine art of an incredible physics system... something that I've made plenty of new friends from... something with a great community where I rarely experience toxicity/negativity but rather "Nice one!" or "No problem" to most positive/negative events (admittingly I play on the right side of the bell curve somewhere - you'd hope so after this many hours).

Rocket League, all things considered, stands as the #1 game in my 26 years of life so far.  I'm not into cars or soccer either, so they did something right.
Quick 5-minute games of soccer with cars! Blow people up, fly through the air, make memories scoring amazing goals or with your friends. The ultimate sports game for sporty and non-sporty people alike.
Rocket League is a Football(Soccer) inspired sports game made by Psyonix. In this game you use a car to hit around a large ball into a goal, pretty much Football(Soccer) with cars. It might be the best game I've played this year so far.

There are a few different game modes, including online, Exhibition where you play against bots or your friends in local play, and a season mode where you play as a member on a team and you try and complete a season and win the championship. The game modes are fun, but not very different from each other. I do wish the Season mode was more like a Franchise mode in something like Madden, being able to control all the little things of your team, and having more stat tracking would make it a lot better, but its still worth a play or two.

The gameplay in this game is perfect. Once you figure out the flow to your car, how to use boosting properly, and how to track the ball, you'll realize just how addicing the game can be. Against bots or online, the game shines in its fun and addicting gameplay that adds a unique twist on the game of Football(Soccer). Learning the game comes quick, but mastering the techniques could easily take 30-50 hours of gameplay. 

You have a large selection of cars and different things you can design them with. The speed and hitboxes are pretty much the same, so there isn't an optimal car to use, which is a great thing. All the different customization is basically cosmetic that does some minor stat tracking. I'm really happy they went this route, because you don't feel obligated to build your car based on some kind of metagame, you can customize it however you like it. 

Besides the season mode being kind of lacking, the only other complaint I had(notice, had), was the online. The first day I had it I couldn't play online at all, it just didn't work, and apparently until Saturday the online was pretty much broken. Thankfully, its been pretty much fixed, but I thought it would be an important point to mention. It is good that the developers showed commitment and actually fixed the problem, though.

Rocket League is an amazing game with addictive gameplay. I don't really get the people that say they don't like sports games, a lot of the gameplay and stat tracking in them is great, and this game is no exception. If your looking for a game to play with friends, or even by yourself that is very competitive based, or even if your just bored and looking for a game to risk $20 on, Give Rocket League a shot, its one of the best games to come out this year. 

Pros:
-Strong gameplay
-Easy to learn, hard to master 
-Plenty of car customization
-No car building meta, you can customize without worry
-Encoranges teamwork
-Reasonable asking price($20)

Cons:
-Lacking season mode could use more stat tracking and player control

Don't let my hours discourage you. I have been playing this game on PS4 since it's release date of July 2015. I've loved every second. (Well, maybe not EVERY second)

Soccer with cars. I don't know how that concept works, but it does. Perfectly. Rocket League is the gold standard of a competitive sports game. It is super easy for anyone to just pick up a controller and play. The controls are simple, as well as the core gameplay. It's a great concept. Anybody can play it, but only when you take the time practicing to learn how to predict the ball, where to hit the ball to direct it, and how to fly is when the real game shines.

The customization in Rocket League is wonderful. Upon just starting, you're given few cars, decals, wheels, etc. As you play, more customization options are randomly unlocked upon completing a match. The ways you can customize cars is endless, with no two cars looking the same. The customization has no effect on the stats of each car, each is purely cosmetic. On the topic of stats, the bodies of each car do have individual stats. Hitboxes, turn radius, and acceleration times all become a factor when choosing a car that suits you. Microtransactions do exist in this game in the form of Crates. Much like CS:GO, you purchase keys to open said crates, which contain items from common to Exotic. Items in crates tend to be much cooler looking than the items that are included in the vanilla game, with moving decals and electric wheels being two of the many highlights. Fortunately, everything in these crates are purely cosmetic, meaning there is no Pay-to-win factor in Rocket League. I actually find myself buying these keys more often than in other games. This is probably the only game in which I have no problem supporting the developers, because they are doing such an amazing job.

Now, onward to the gameplay, the most unique aspect of Rocket League. At its core, each match consists of two teams trying to score more goals into the opponents net to win. However, with the addition of boost and the ability to drive on walls, the game becomes much more than that. Pressing the jump button while in the air will propel your car into any direction you are moving, allowing you to hit the ball with a little more force. This mechanic is great for putting the ball where you want it to go, with direct control of where your car is. The driving in this game feels smooth and crisp, with a handbrake allowing very tight turns. Boost allows you to accellerate at a much quicker speed, and put more power into your shot. The boost mechanic really comes into play when the boost is used to thrust your car off the ground, turning your car into a rocket ship with wheels. This results in some truly beautiful shots and rewards the players who take the time to practice this move. Seeing somebody fly so gracefully toward the ball, smacking it into the net is just something so great that isn't found in other games. For newcomers, even hitting the ball can give satisfaction, and a narrow miss can make your heart skip a beat. After countless hours of playtime, I still find myself tensing up before a big hit.

Upon scoring, the ball explodes into the net, throwing any player close enough accross the pitch. This is very satisfying, and it accompanied with a replay of the goal in slow motion, allowing you to see all of the glory (or B.S., in some cases). Quick chats are available such as "Nice Shot!" and "Wow!", although expect to get slightly tilted as "What a save!" will be spammed if you miss a save.

Teams in Rocket League can have up to 4 players, with game modes of 1v1, 2v2, 3v3, and 4v4. The 4v4 game mode is a little too chaotic for my liking (Which is probably why it is called 'chaos'). 2v2 and 3v3 are undoubtedly the best game modes, as this is where team play really shines. A pass to a teammate that leads to a goal (Even though it was probably not intentional) is a spectacular feeling, especially when shared with friends. There are also variations of these game modes, like Hoops, a basketball version of the game with hoops instead of goals. Snow Day, in which a hockey puck replaces the ball, and Rumble, where every 10 seconds you get a powerup ranging from a Glove to punch the ball and spikes that make the ball stick to your car. These game modes are fun from time to time, but I don't spend too much time playing them. The most recent addition, Dropshot, is undoubtedly the most fun game mode they have added. It consists of two teams of 3 and no goals. The objective is to smash the ball into the ground, causing the ground to take damage. Upon taking enough damage, the ground will open up, creating a goal for your team. Not only is this game mode fun as hell, it also serves as good practice for hitting those aerials.

Rocket League is one of those rare games in which a competitive mode is implemented into the game. Competitive has 4 game modes: Duel (1v1), Doubles (2v2), Standard (3v3), and Solo Standard (3v3, however no parties are allowed). Included with these game modes are ranks to measure your skill. The ranks range range from Bronze to Platinum to Champion. Within each rank are 3 sub-categories. For example, within Gold there is Gold I, Gold II, and Gold III, with I being the lowest and III being the highest. Furthermore, within these categories are divisions. Divisions range from I-IV, with IV being the highest. If you were to start out as Gold I division II, winning a game would bring you to division III, and the opposite for a loss. Once you pass division IV, you move up in categorym making you Gold II. During Season 3 of competitive play I managed to make it up to Champion, although it took lots of time and lots of patience. It's so addictive, you'll have yourself saying 'just one more game' after each match.

Also on the rise is the pro-league scene for Rocket League. We are about to enter the finals the the third season of the Rocket League Championship Series, with North America and Europe about to battle it out in the World Championships. Pro matches in Rocket League are unlike any other game. The teamwork and ball movement across the pitch are truly incredible. I highly recommend checking it out.

Unfortunately, with all other competitive games, smurfs are an issue in Rocket League. It sucks, because you could be one win away from getting that new rank, and then a smurf comes and sets you back down a few divisions. Also, with the implementation of the new ranks in Competitive, there are many high level players being placed into really low ranks. This is not only unfair to the players who get ranked low, but to the people they play against. I'm hoping this issue gets fixed, but it seems to be a problem every time a new season begins.

Updates to this game are very frequent. New content is delivered almost monthly, with new maps, cars, game modes, and crates. The development team knows how to handle a game and keep their community happy, which is refreshing to see. The game sees new content every few months. The developers are constantly adding things to the game, keeping it fresh for its players. Not enough credit can be given to Psyonix and their development with the game. Rocket League couldn't be in better hands.

So, should you buy Rocket League? Absolutely. It is arguably the best game you can buy for under $20 right now. Rocket League is an extraordinary game. It's a game that I can constantly come back to, because it never gets repetitve. The mechanics are some of the best compared to similar games and with the competitve scene making a rise, I think this game will stick around for a long time.

PROS:
- Easy to pick up
- Mechanics are phenomenal
- Balanced
- Microtransactions are purely cosmetic
- Competitive play is implemented into the game
- Customization is endless
- Frequent updates
- Good community
- Never repetitive
- Little to no bugs
- Gameplay is just pure fun

CONS:
- Smurfs
- Ranking system is messed up
- "What a save!"
Rocket League is a great game. The core mechanics are fun and very well executed. Currently the servers don't work and I haven't been able to play online. I would easily reccomend this game for the single player alone. The only real concern I have is that it may not offer enough content to keep the community alive for any significant length of time.  

[b]Edit* Servers are working now.[/b] 

For a more in-depth review watch my video review here:

[h1]This is one of the most fun and one of the most unique games out there.[/h1]

Rocket League is one of a kind. This is a game about cars playing football (or soccer depending on where you live) and it is simply just amazing. The gameplay is great, it's easy to play but hard to master. If you have friends to play with you'll have an even better time with it than going solo, but going at it alone can be quite enjoyable too. There are no server issues and all DLC is purely cosmetic with there being no direct advantages to using a certain car over another (although each car has different hitboxes).

The main mode will have you playing 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and chaotically fun 4v4 matches and the game gets updated often with free game modes such as Hoops and Dropshot. You can tell the love the developers have for this game with everything they do and how they listen to the community and the game greatly improves thanks to it.

This game, although it looks simple, it is honestly extremely well-made and perfected making it a game that will have you coming back to it. It is fun in it's purest form.
A must-own game.

Every single person I know who's tried this game had a blast.

There's so much I could say about Rocket League, but I'll keep this short.

You won't regret buying this, even at full price.
edit: I wrote this prior to becoming an employee at Psyonix

Let me start by saying that I have been playing the preview of this game since June 26th, I also was a part of the alpha in 2014 and part of multiple betas.

Simply said, this game is the most fun that may ever exist. You find yourself constantly saying 'Just one more game' over and over and over again because you literally cannot just put it down. It's simple: a car arena like showdown on a soccer field with one giant ball and a bunch of boost to fill your rocket powered dreams, but don't be fooled because this game is much deeper than it will originally look. Psyonix takes a very simlpe core idea and allows us to do whatever we want with it because of its purely physics based gameplay. 

What does this give us though? Let me tell you. Satisfyingly tight controls, action packed multiplayer, awe inspiring aerial goals, sniper tactics, competitive and casual matchmaking, hours of laughing and enjoyment, TONS of explosions (Mr. Torgue aproved), an incredibly balanced game, all future maps will be free, PC to PS4 crossplay, over 150 items for purely cosmetic customizations, and over 10billion of said combinations. 

I can really only say so much about the game itself (partly because English was my worst course :P) but what I really cannot stress enough is that you won't be staying for just the game alone. You'll be seeing Psyonix as one of the only developers left that actually understand what we want as well as falling in love with the community. 

The community of Rocket League (and SARPBC for that matter) is probably the most open, friendly and supportive community I have come accross. Of course this is being said before release and I really hope that you new players please uphold our standard of ingame complements, willingness to help out anyone that wants to learn, and general good sportsmanship. If you find yourself running into a few bad apples, don't worry about it, as you climb up the ladder into the ranks with the rest of the long time players you'll notice the warmer atmosphere to say the least :)

Now I suppose I should say that within the last week I've apparently played nearly 90hrs and that's just playing private matches with the same people constantly. Some would think that I'd be bored after that, but you'd be so so wrong. I can play all day, get into bed and watch some Rocket League videos, and then immediately want to play more (I may or may not be addictive :| but don't think you're immune).

Anyways, I'm going to play some more Rocket League. I hope to see you on the field, and remember... Nice shpt! And never let the ball touch the ground (Rule #1)
This game is fun at all skill levels.  It's intuitive to learn the rules and difficult to master the mechanics and strategy.  Rocket League is one of the most unique, innovative games around.  I originally bought it when it came out thinking $20 for a weekend of fun would be worth it, but a couple thousand hours later it's still challenging and enjoyable.  My #1 game since it came out.  Much love to Psyonix <3
To give you an idea of how good this game is - I currently have 511 games in my Steam library, and this is the [i]only[/i] one I've gone out of my way to review. 

SARPBC (the PS3 predecessor to Rocket League) has been a favorite of my friends and I for... years. Literally years. We've put thousands of hours into it. It's one of those incredibly rare games that all of us are always keen to play because it's always fun. 

Rocket League, I'm happy to say, is SARPBC with improved graphics and gameplay, better accessibility for new players, plus a ton of added options that give the game an extra layer of character. It's going to comfortably replace SARPBC in my top five games, all-time, across all genres. It's also replacing SARPBC as my absolute favorite multiplayer game - online or local. 


[b]Positive[/b]

+ Fun, deep, brilliantly fast-paced gameplay
+ Games are long enough to mean something, but short enough that a loss is never too frustrating.
+ Games are almost never over until the final buzzer. Results can turn on a dime - and when they do, it's always because a player or team has stepped up, rather than any fault of or flaw with the game itself. 
+ The learning curve is fairly smooth, but the skill ceiling is also incredibly high. Despite the aforementioned years playing SARPBC, I still see players in Rocket League pulling off moves that I can only dream of.
+ There's massive flexibility in how you play, more than any other game I know of. Offline with bots. Offline split-screen. Online. Online split-screen. Online split-screen with bots. 1 v 1 if you don't feel like playing on a team, or 2 v 2 / 3 v 3 / 4 v 4 if you do. And the game is just as suited to mano-a-mano matches as it is to team play, which is (again) a very, very rare quality.


[b]Negative[/b]

- The one slightly disappointing thing I'll mention is (at launch) the lack of variety in maps. SARPBC had a bunch of quite inventive, distinctive maps that forced different play styles and tactics. Rocket League's maps are aesthetically different, but structurally uniform. Luckily, word is that some 'crazier' maps will likely be arriving in the forthcoming free DLC.  I'm still thoroughly enjoying what's already there, but some extra variety in that regard will definitely be welcome.


[b]Conclusion[/b]

If the idea of fast-paced soccer (sans rules) with cars even vaguely appeals to you, get this game immediately. It's one I fully expect to still be playing - and thoroughly enjoying - years from now.
As a competitive gamer, it's not often I'm able to find a game that continues to be enjoyable while I'm getting completely dominated; but Rocket League delivers that perfectly. I've played for almost 400-hours and I have yet to figure out why, exactly, this game is so fun to so many different people from so many walks of life. But whatever the reason, Psyonix has delivered a near-flawless hybrid cross between a Single-Character-Controlled Sports game (Soccer, Hockey, Basketball), a Racing game, a Flying game, and a competitive multiplayer experience.

Pros:
- Replayability is consistent.
- Servers cover /many/ regions. (Most of the world.)
- No single Battlecar has a distinct advantage in all fields over every other Battlecar. (There are pros and cons to every Battlecar.)
- Battlecar customizability feels endless.
- Fun for casual gamers.
- Fun for competitive gamers.
- Quick 5-minute matches so you aren't forced to risk losing after 45-minutes.
- Split-screen playable Local OR Online.
- Psyonix listens to players and integrates desired features.
- This Pros list could go on and on.

Cons:
- Not the easiest game to just pick up and play.
-- New players may become discouraged by having difficulty hitting the ball at all. (Don't give up! You'll get it down relatively quickly!)
- Online players can be incredibly rude (as with any online multiplayer game).
- It takes a LOT of time to become a skilled player.
- In-game voice chat quality is unbearable. (Most players use third-party VoIP programs to avoid this issue.)

It has been years since I've found a game that has me as addicted and dedicated as I am to Psyonix's Rocket League. This is a game I'll be playing for a long, long time.

9.5/10


EDIT: Paid DLC is not completely cosmetic, as DLC Battlecars have different hitboxes and turn radiuses than base cars. This, however, does not make any paid DLC Battlecar specifically better than base Battlecars. Every Battlecar has its pros and cons between hitboxes and turn radiuses.
This is a great game.  Imagine car soccer, hockey, basketball, etc.

Tons of FREE fun cosmetics to dress up your cars.   The more you play, the more freebies you get!
This isn't just a game. This a lecture from Psyonix.

Great game, gameplay is incredible, all the mechanics are realistic and make perfect sense, the community is usually friendly and helpful appart from a couple toxic people. Cheaters are virtually inexistant, due to the fact that the game is really a game you can cheat on, i can't even think of a cheat you could use that would give you a competitive advantage. The graphics are great, the updates and dlc psyonix provide are great, and the psyonix staff, give feedback and give clear and constructive responses to any problems the community members may have. Overall great experience, would highly recommend it, can't wait till this game becomes a massive esport like csgo or LoL.
You first spend 20 hours chasing the ball and learning how to hit it while get used to the ball camera.
Then 200 hours to feel confident soaring in the air, by 500 hours you know how to hit specific angles and use the handbreak to be even faster.
All this depth in a 5 minute game of football with cars.
[spoiler] dankeshen für das spiel weiss haifisch	[/spoiler]
Great game with high replayability. It's polished, pretty, and plays without any issues. The local co-op makes it a great game for a party and the simple controls are inviting to everyone. The game length feels just right and the matchmaking system is fast. This is the only game on steam that will allow you to land a bicycle kick goal with a rocket powered battle car.
I adore this game. It's easily one of the most nail-biting, shouting at your computer screen, clutch games I've played in a long time. They struck on gold with Rocket League, its straight forward presentation belie an incredible amount of complexity and finesse.

A game I recommend to everyone!
9.5/10
[h1]In the 80s and 90s, this is what everyone thought video games would be like in the future: rocket cars playing virtual sports; TRONxSpeed Racer, with the international appeal of soccer. [/h1]

[i]You're jacked in to this new thing called the Internet, where you can play against people the world 'round. You're a weakly 13 year old midwesterner named Billy, but when you're jacked in, you're Tom Cruise in Top Gun, no, Days of Thunder. You're the best there ever was.

Stay on target, stay on target... [i][b]click, blarp[/b][/i]. You're out of rocket fuel! You click again just in case, like a last desperate pull of an empty gun's trigger. The clock ticks downward as you swerve towards a boost pickup... you grab it... seconds left on the clock... the ball appears in front of you as an angel out of the blue... you jump, squeeze the last bit of juice out of your machine and soar heavenward... AND IT'S GOOD! BILLY FROM THE MIDWEST HAS DEFEATED THE RUSSIAN MENACE!!!![/i]

Every second you play the game is the last five minutes of every sports movie ever made.
[b] Very addictive and entertaining game. [/b]

Rocket League is a game that always introduces new aspects to you and never lets you get bored. It is definitely a game that keeps you hooked, but is amazingly entertaining at the same time. The trading community is excellent and finally getting an item you always wanted can leave you feeling so accomplished. The car customization itself is an awesome feature that offers so many different customizations. As you progress through the different skill levels there are new techniques to learn and playstyles which are awesome to know. The competitive scene behind this game is getting larger and it is so fun to watch such high level players play!

All in all, i'd completely recommend this game to anyone, whether you're a casual player or very competitive!
Amazing game.

This game is so dynamic and energetic, not a second is spent bored. Non stop action with your team, always edging to get the game deciding nudge, whether it be defense or attack. You spend hours, upon hours, getting addicted and mastering your skills. 

This game will make it to the massive multiplayer leagues. Rocket League will improve once they get proper class ranks, gained through playing ranked matches. 

Rocket League also features in depth customisation, allowing the user to ultimately customise their vehicle. This allows uniqueness, and a great ton of laughter.

Graphics of this game are amazing. If your computer isn't the best then you'll have to turn down the graphics a little, but your PC doesn't need to be expensive to play the game on great graphics. Decent laptops can even play this game decently.

This game is honestly a 9/10. Rocket League has the graphics, the dynamic energetic gameplay, the competitive experience in multiplayer and more.

You haven't bought this game yet so scroll back up and buy this masterpiece

I couldn't recommend this game any more if I tried. Buy this game right now. You will never regret it.

This is one of the most entertaining, fun, and addictive games I've ever played. Just like its predecessor, this game provides hours upon hours of entertainment. The physics are superb, the gameplay is easy to pick up and thrilling to master, and it looks beautiful. It's a game that definitely gets better as you improve, which makes it more and more fun as you play it. There's something extremely addicitve about playing football/soccer with cars, and with the addition of boost, acrobatics, and flying, it just never stops being fun. It's one of those games where you always say "one more game" over and over again. There's plenty of different gamemodes to play, including season mode, drill training, online ranked, unranked, private, split-screen, split-screen online, and a bunch more. 

[b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
    [*]The game looks beautiful
    [*]The physics are spot on, so the game relies entirely on your own skill, with no automatic passing and shooting. You're on your own, which makes making saves and scoring goals so much more satisfying.
    [*]It's so addictive...like really addictive...like "oh my god is it 5am already?" addictive.
    [*]It's incredibly well optimised, as evident by the generous system requirements. You don't need a fantastic PC to play this game on high settings, but it still looks and plays beautifully at 60fps with not-as-good PCs
    [*]There is a bunch of customisation features, including body types, skins, hats, boost trails, tires, and whatnot.
    [*]Rank-based matchmaking, so you actually play people of similar ability, rather than being bored getting thrashed or thrashing other players
    [*]There's cross-play with PS4 users
    [*]It's a fantastic party game to play with your friends on split-screen, or online
    [*]The gameplay is flawless, making it really easy for new players to pick up, but allowing for an insanely high skill ceiling where the top players can really pull of some amazing skills
[/list]

[b]Cons:[/b]
[list]
    [*]It will ruin other aspects of your life, such as your social life and work life with its addictiveness.

- requires a lot of time and patient to master the game.
I love this game!  Soccer/Football in RC cars with jets strapped to their back and an exploding ball.  The controls are tight, the action intense and it's a pulse pounding thrill ride even when you lose.

Don't get me wrong, just like with real soccer/football it's easy to play but difficult to play well.  But the training gives you the tools, you just need to practice. Highly recommended for anyone who likes action packed games with high speed thrills and crazy crashes.  

Remember when you were a kid and you were practicing catching high fly balls?  How you had to practice getting under it and timing it just right?  Get ready for that with jet cars.
It's a fun, competitive, and challenging game with really cool events going on here and there. Controller recommended...unless you really hate yourself.
Rocket League is a completely physics-based fast-paced sports game where cars play soccer. A very simple concept, but it's the most fun you could ever have in a video game. The learning curve is very steep, so you might struggle when you begin, but the game's addictive nature will probably grab you anyway and make you play for hours until you're too tired to even go to sleep, so you play more and you realize you've been playing 5 days non-stop and you're dead. Even though it's such a simple idea, there's so much you can do in this game. If you're a newcomer, don't forget to try flying! (Spoiler alert: It's f***ing awesome!)

It also has great potential to become a big e-sports game, something that I'm really looking forward to.

The list of features at the moment isn't huge, but hopefully the devs will add more things in future updates like they've promised. (Psyonix always keeps their promises, so I wouldn't worry about it!) The season mode is a great place for new players to practice their skills against the AI, but the online mode is where most of the fun of the game lies. And, the customization is sick. Oh and the insanely cool replay editor! Also new free maps in the future confirmed!

All in all this game is very solid, very competitive and fun, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes skill-based games or is into sports.


Better than FIFA. 10/10.
When i first started I had a really fun experience. Now that I have spent a lot of time im startingto have even more fun and I've even earned money from playing it. Would definitly recommed this game if your looking for a fun multiplayer game where you can share your experiences with your friends
This game is the most fun, balanced and joyful game I have ever played. The game is easy to get into, but hard to master. It allows so much creativity at higher levels of play. It can be fun on any rank or skill level. However, it can be stressful and offsetting sometimes, since there can be an occurance of lagg and toxicity. Being lucky isn't always the case in matches as well. 

Overall - 9,5/10
[h1][b]Cars playing soccer/football[/b][/h1]

But wait! There is more:
Even though on the first look this game's concept appears simple and goofy, the depth of gameplay found here is insanely high. Rocket League is one of those games which allow you to do amazing plays and moves if you dedicated time and effort into it, but at the same time provide a lot of fun while played casually with friends.


[h1]What to expect[/h1]

This game is the sequel to the PS3 game Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars from 2008. Therefore the game idea isn't new and the gameplay doesn't differ a lot. But since the same developer Psyonix stay behind Rocket League, their experience allowed them to address problems and improve the game (as well as shorten the name :P).

Rocket League provides fast 5 minute rounds inside a box-shaped arena. The edges of the arena are curved to allow players to drive up walls and even on the ceiling. The team size can range from one to four players on each team.

The gameplay is fast and because of the playingfield's small size goals can be scored from the other side of it, since there are no obstacles in the way other than a potentional defending player. Blocking the ball and doing a counterattack right afterwards happens within seconds and can turn an entire game.


[h1]The cars[/h1]

There are multiple car models to choose from, but their handling or top speed does not differ. Only the hitbox of the cars are slighly different - which creates some tiny variation in the ball interaction. However the main purpose of having multiple cars is to customize it without interfering or imbalancing the gameplay. This works very well and choosing a car is a personal preference rather than a statistical battle to determine which car is the best. The car customization comes with color, surface type, additional decal, wheels, antenna, goofy hats and particles for the rocket trail.

"Rocket trail?" you may ask. Well, in Rocket League every car has a Rocket Engine attached to its back allowing to boost itself to greater speed. The best part is that you can jump and shoot yourself into the air with it and being able to fly. This creates gameplay in all three dimensions. Instead of just dribbling the ball on the ground, you can launch yourself into the air and hit the ball before your enemy can. It is not easy and adds a decent learning-curve to the game.


[h1]The experience[/h1]

The game is very polished. The options menu allows key rebinding serparatly for keyboard and controller, very in-depth adjustments to the camera position/behaviour as well as a large choice of grafic options for the Unreal Engine 3.
Textures are very detailed, particle effects very well made. The grass on the ground is fantastically animated. Even though the arena/stadiums are the same, there are four different theme versions, ranging from a raining indoor park to a full blown stadium with thousand of people cheering.

The cars handle very well, can turn fast and stick to the ground unless you want and tell them to drift. Once airborne keeping the control of the car or wanting to do what you want is difficult but not impossible. The physic engine of the game does it's work very well. The ball itself is predictable and doesn't behave random at all.

You unlock new parts for your car customization after completing each game - no matter the outcome of the match. The account progress is ok, but nothing incredible or important. This game shines when it comes to it's gameplay.

The sound effects as well as grafical effects while playing or just driving around are incredible enjoyable. Boosting to full speed makes you feel powerful, ramming people and even destroying them creates satisfing explosions. And when scoring a goal the ball explodes and creates a shockwave on which you can ride on with your rocket launcher. Directly afterwards you get a replay of the goal in slow motion. At the end of the game you can save a replay of the entire game and watch it whenever you want.
Setting up goals and blocking the ball also feel rewarding by the system and on a team-spirit basis.

Since the game has high skill ceiling, experienced players can crush any other ones. The matchmaking system works very well in that regard, that you get matched up with equally good players and even indicates if it doesnt find them and slowly extends it's skill range in order to find players as fast as possible. You can group up to play together in normal and ranked games.
You also have the choice of selecting multiple regional servers such as Europe, Oceanic, West- and East-America, as well as queueing up for multiple modes (e.g. 1vs1 and 3v3) at the same time. The game will put you in the first fitting game it can find for you.

The game also provides a singleplayer campaign against the AI, as well as tutorials and training for various parts of the game such as defending the goal and scoring goals. For those who just want to get used to the controls or test can hop into the sandbox mode.
I also like to mention that you can queue up for an online game from any menu or singleplayer gamemode. So while searching you can play around in sandbox mode.


[h1]Downloadable Content (Supersonic Fury DLC Update)[/h1]

As announced by Psyonix, the first major update hit Rocket League. I first was disappointed that they want to go the DLC route. Not because i dont like to pay for content, but more because of the bad reputation the word 'DLC' has nowadays, fearing that Rocket League gets looked down for doing this markt strategie. But my fear should vanish.

The first DLC just includes two new car and customization items for a small price. The real update includes free stuff for everyone. New map, new specator mode, better ranked play, improved main menu background, and so on. With the new update the 20€ i pay for the game are even more worth it. And Psyonix plans are to keep going, maybe even into the direction of modding and crazy maps.

So yes. I am excited for every upcomming Update and DLC.


[h1]Conclusion[/h1]

I recommend this game to everyone. May it be casual players, those who play in a group to have fun together as well as the ones who like play competitively. Playing this game has the perfect fun/frustration balance and great learning curve.
A game that's doing it's job. No micro-transactions, no crappy story, no lags, no bad port / development.

I miss these kind of games - so simple and so good.
10/10
Rocket League...The game that took the gaming scene by surprise. Personally, I don't enjoy car games, racing games, or sports games. Especially not soccer. Then why does this game interest me so much?

I have no idea. 

Nevertheless, I haven't been able to play hardly any other games for my newfound love for thrust sticks attached to what look like toy cars. You'll start out jump-flipping into the ball, and being amazed at how you hit it just right to make your first goal. Then you'll experiment with boosting after you jumped. "I hit it!" you say. Finally, you were able to touch the ball while it soars 50 feet above the ground. As you cascade to the field, you realize that the death-defying acrobatic maneuver was just enough to tip the ball [i]into your goal[/i]
Rocket League is one of those rare games that oozes love from its developers. 

You will sink hours into this game there is no escaping that. With an amazing multiplayer mode that includes split screen (something sorely missing from too many games today)  that you can take online. Great controls , superb physics . and an additive season mode this game is well worth the $20. 

10/10
This short review is written exactly one year since I bought this game.

Well, Rocket League is addictive, fun, and a game which is easy to learn, but hard to master.

The first amazing thing of this game is, it is a hybrid game, the combination of football (and basketball, hockey, etc) with cars. If you are looking for sports game but getting bored of casual football or basketball games, then you should give Rocket League a try, you probably will like it. This game is all about skill and teamwork, other things won't affect your win (except your network, of course)

The second one is the customization, there are tons of items for your car and millions combination that you can try (but you know, most items can only be obtained by getting random drops, or opening the crates with key that you need to buy or by trading with other players. However, you don't need to have those expensive items to be the best in this game.  You can play with standard Octane that you got from the beginning and become the Grand Champ if you got what it takes.

The third one is the community, I know that you will find so many different people in this game, trash talker, noob, ball chaser, but still, there are still good people. I did find some of them, and they showed me how to get better in this game. Other than that, custom training is there for you, created by the community of Rocket League.

However, most people say that the server is suck, but i don't agree 100% with them. Most of the time i played smoothly, no problem. But it doesn't mean i never encountered any problem during online play. Well the server is not perfect, but it's not that bad. I still got ping spikes in some server, but most servers are good. So basically you need to double check your connection first before blaming Psyonix for the server. 

Overall, this game is a must try for you guys. I'm going to give 8.8/10 for this game. I got addicted to be honest. I've been spending more than 900 hours in this game so you could tell how much i love to play this one.
Good. Let's say a few about this game. Wow, football  with toy cars? This game reminds me of the game Revolt with toy cars. It's a bit difficult for a beginner to learn how to play football with cars :)). I strongly recommend it. I really like this game.
[H1]If You Haven't Yet Tried Rocket League, It's A Must Play For PC Gamers![/H1]
Such addictive gameplay with perfectly customizable controls (as well as customizing your car if that interests you). Can be stressful at times as some people are orders of magnitude better at it than me, but thankfully the matchmaking / club usually works well to find you a quick fair match!

Thank you for integrating politics with the video game industry

~~ SHAME ON YOU ~~ (But still positive)
Okay guys, this has to be my favorite game of all time hands down! I mean hitting balls with cars, that's SICK! Plus they have rocket boosters so they can fly! Flying cars I mean cmon. If i tried to ram into a ball as big as that in real life I would be dead or in severe injury from a car accident, but I'm not because this is a video game! I might be a bias reviewer because I've played the game for 3,000+ hours and bought the game for my friends and I on several occasions, but you NEED to buy this game! You will get so addicted to this game like me. One time my mom told me to get off but I snuck back on to play Rocket League! AND I HAD SCHOOL THE NEXT DAY! So if you want a gut wrenching, enjoyable, and fun game, this is it!
I wasn't sure what to expect when I first loaded up this title, but am I certainly glad I did. It's one of the most addictive games I've ever played. Aside from the vast array of customization at your disposal, the core gameplay is a sight to behold. From driving home goals with blunt force to keeping the ball out of your own goal, the level of depth and strategy that this game encompasses cannot go unstated. The visuals themselves are great, but add on top of that unlockable goal animations, mods for your vehicle and much more, and you've got yourself a family friendly game of car soccer that's easy to get sucked into for hours. If you're going to make any purchase, particularly one you expect to play online for the foreseeable future, Rocket League is one you have to get your hands on.
I reccomend this game its really cool game with cool stuff inside in fact i have 800 hours on this game from the beggining you Will play as noob but then u Will improve because it looks Like easy game but from beggining it isnt and really when u play games like cs:go or PUBG try this game to abreact
Great multiplayer skill game with regular updates and, for those who love feeling pretty, lots of nice, cheap DLCs and Season Passes. If you are new to this, don't give up because you find it too hard. It takes time, to be honest, to achieve some crazy stuff and clean 'aerial' shots, but if you play with the right people, you'll have lots of fun. Otherwise, it's true that some members are excessively toxic. The solution: disabling chat or limiting it to "Quick chat" only.

One major inconvenience is the Tournaments update which does not allow solo queuers to take part in 2s or 3s. There should have been a "Find a team" option.

Bugs are rather rare. Server performance is getting better as months pass. 

Controller HIGHLY recommended. I have played roughly 1000 hours with my keyboard and when I used the controller for the first plays, I have learnt lots of mechanisms that were impossible to do with the keyboard.
At a first glance, this game seems to promote all men's fantasies while they sculpt their best shape of a couch potato. 
We're dealing with a football game starring big good-looking vehicles, and in which the best way to boast is car tuning. 

Let's not mention the fact that this testosteroned environment, like the Call of Duty franchise, is fulfilled with 12-15 years old players wanting to show that they don't need a driving license to be cool.

But when you set this aside and fully play the game for what it is and not what it looks like, you find a balanced, competitive and entertaining action game. You will need lots and lots of playtime, maybe some practice, and trial-and-error sessions, if you want to improve ; but in the end the more you play the more you enjoy the game. You come for the entertainment and you stay to master the tool between your hands.

The competitive modes are in my opinion the soul of the game. The rank system gives a lot of motivation to climb without any upper rank seeming out of reach. With the casual modes only, I don't think I would have trained and played this game that much, far from it.

Don't play this game if you know you're a tryharder and do not have that much time to play.
Don't play this game if you expect to make ceiling shots with a keyboard and a mouse.
Otherwise, don't even think twice before putting that game in your cart. One of the biggest (even though not the most friendly) Steam communities awaits behind this game, and playing a few matches will show you why they are still here !
I can drive recklessly while hitting giant ball around a pretty nice looking football field, I'd say it's very well worth the price, quite the original concept too.
Most rewarding game I have ever played. It's always a thrill to play, as you keep getting better, ranking up, and playing against better opponents. Very high skill ceiling. Never gets boring
What a frickin great game! i love it so much,keep up the good work psyonix. Keep adding some new skin, wheels, and other cool stuff! proud to play your game.
One of the best games I've ever played, soon up on 900h since release and I dont even like "Football" games, says alot.
One of a few multiplayer games you actually dont really need the sound active, perfect for podcast gaming and what not.
For anyone who wants to have a good time playing with friends, this game is for you. It doesn't matter if you like shooter games, puzzle games, or RPG games, everyone will love Rocket League. The controls take a while to master, so it's a perfect progression speed. I am Diamond 3 in 2s and I love this game so much. If you can get this game, DO IT!
Fun game. Huge learning curve. But if you're willing to invest hundreds of hours to become the best of the best, you'll do ok. Otherwise, its a great game to just play for fun.
game is fun, servers can be pretty trash. opponents can be nice or awful, teammates too. Is fun to play with friends. (just try not to lose them in the process)
High skill ceiling, but fun throughout all the levels. esports is amazing to watch.
my car is pretty.
9/10
Great game. Physics are very easy to get in tune with and once you do, that's when the real fun begins. Aerials and stuff are really fun to hit and make you feel great.
A GREAT GAME JUST GOT BETTER
I CAN NOW ENJOY PLAYING WITH MY SONS, THANKS TO THE CROSS PLATFORM.
JUST A SHAME I CAN'T TALK TO THEM AS I AM ON PC AND THERE ON PS4
LOVE THIS GAME, ALMOST AS MUCH AS SEX
One of the best games I have played in years. I'm an FPS guy but this got me soo addicted.
When I saw the trailer I thought the game is veery difficult, but after just few days of messing around I got sucked into the game so much.

Highly recommended!
This game has changed my whole thought about what was popular back in 2015, ever since I became a platinum I could never stop playing this game. It has been my favorite game no doubt, I recommend you try this game out and give it a chance to be a very great game to play.
Ah, where do I begin talking about RL? I dislike car games, racing games and sports games, but Rocket League is the greatest game ever made! It looks silly at first, but after playing a few games by yourself, you start to really feel the magic and soon you'll be chanting "one more game!" With that, here is my completely unbiased review of my favorite game in the world: 

Pros: 
1. Awesome Competitive Scene, while still being accessible to new players 
2. 'Easy to Learn, Hard to Master' - game has an infinite skill cap and great replayability
3. Entertainment value is through the roof! $20 and it's the most played game in my library and many others
4. Gameplay, controls and mechanics are all really solid (imo, best on controller)
5. Is very enjoyable, whether you are coop, solo, casual or competitive

Cons: 
1. Game is beautiful but graphically dated. Game is lacking a proper AA and texture detail. 
2. Game servers can sometimes appear to lag for everyone in the game. This has been pretty minor for me, but something others reviewers have brought up. 

Other comments: 
1. People report that the community is toxic. Yes, there are toxic people of every rank, who will say things that will make you want to uninstall RL forever. There's also a host of super cool, super chill dudes and dudettes that are out to have a good time, win or lose. 
2. Personally, I think the matchmaking in ranked is pretty fair and I haven't noticed what other reviewers are saying about the matchmaking being horrible. Sure, there's smurfs and the occasional bad match up - just like any game - I think Psyonix has done a good job of limiting smurf and bad ranked matches with recent updates.  
3. There are loot crates and 'season' passes you can spend real money on. I personally don't care about this, as there is no mandatory or "pay to win" DLC 
4. Many reviewers talk about special modes becoming ranked (i.e. Rumble). For the most part, I only play standard ranked and casual games, so I have no comment, this has not impacted the core RL experience for me. 

If you're looking for a game that's an entertaining, an easy to pick up, couch coop, Rocket League is your game. If you're looking for a game with infinite skills to learn and master, Rocket League is your game. If you're looking for a hardcore competitive e-sport that stretches you, Rocket League is your game. If you have major doubts about the fun you could be having playing this game RIGHT NOW, buy it and you won't have to doubt anymore! 




PLEASE READ THIS. I would consider myself an experienced player being ranked at champion 2 in doubles with roughly 2,000 hours on the game (500 on steam and 1,500 on xbox), so i am suitable to write a review for this game. Rocket League is fun simply because you can find fun in it without friends like most games. Dont get me wrong, playing this with just one other friends makes the experience much much better. New updates adding more content come out more often than you would think. Now The real question is: should you buy this game and is it worth your money. The answer to the first question is very difficult because it doesnt depend at all on what type of games you like. I pretty much only played shooters before rocket league, and nothing else. What i say to it is to just try out the game with some friends so you get the full experience. Answering the second question, is it worth the money..... its 20 bucks. All in all, a sort of starter guide would be to play with a friend, and dont take it seriously at all, but try to win at the same time, have fun. See you on the field!
I keep returning to this game for unknown reasons, maybe I just get my daily dose of salt there, idk. Would recommend if you lack confidence and love getting bullied.
Probably the epitome of "easy to learn, hard to master." Probably.

Excellent competitive game that has more tech to it than meets the eye. However, the player base is very toxic. I highly recommend this game if you're looking for either casual fun or hardcore competition, but turn off the chat. You'll make your experience that much better.
Great game for competitive and casual multiplayer! Extremely high skill ceiling however the game can be enjoyed with very little skill too. Highly recommend.
I have spent hundreds on micro transactions for this game, and countless hours on ranked and casual play. I love this game and I will continue to play it for as long as I can. But over the course of time that I have played this game, the servers and quality of play has diminished incredibly. I cannot recall an issue with networking, or gameplay 2 or more years ago. It seems that the devs are more concerned with how much trash content they can put in a rocket pass or crates to make us spend dollars and cents when they don't re-invest the profits into improving servers and general quality improvements. In the last week I have had to uninstall my game, try 3 different network solutions, and nothing has worked. I cannot play more than 2 minutes without my game crashing. Honestly this game is fun, it truly is. Solo or with friends. But how is it fun when I cannot even play it anymore? Step it up Psyonix, I have lost my faith.
After 500+ hours of PC, and 300 hours on xbox. Rocket league has become my go to game. Tons of fun, and a lot to learn. If you want a game to grind I highly suggest Rocket league
It will be 10 hours before you start reliably hitting the ball.
It will be 20 hours before you start hitting the ball towards the right goal.
It will be 30 hours before you start aiming the ball towards the approximate space you want.

If you're okay with being bad at a game for so long, definitely give it a try. It's so much fun. 

Watch some quick youtube videos about rotation and basic things. Disregard the tryhards. Report the toxic plonkers. Enjoy the game.

Great to play with friends. Protip: be friendly to strangers. If they respond, they probably won't mind if you add them on steam.

Oh and don't be afraid of ranked - the matchmaking is so much better.
If you're into fast cars crashing into each other, fast-paced strategic game-play, quick and fast games and FUN, i'd definitely recommend this game! It's currently my most played game on Steam, a lot of games don't keep my attention however this does if that says anything. Thanks for reading :)
Grab It ! Great Game On/Off Line ... You May Get Board After Few Games But Keep At It Have A Break Go back Like Any Other Game At Start Newbie But All Comes Great More You Play It .... Even If You Not In Too Cars Or Football Great Online Play Be Even Better With Eight Friends On 4 x 4 .... Enjoy.
It's a good game but it has a steep learning curve, you can play for quite a while and struggle to get better. Very fun though once you start to learn all the in's and out's of the game :)
See ball, hit ball.

straight garbage "cooldown" system. majority should rule in a vote to forfeit... like ffs really? also in a 2v2 match there should be a way to get out of a game without a cooldown if your teammate won't forfeit. Then to top it off don't have bad internet you drop a game guess what! cooldown! thats right! the game can't even tell a error code from someone leaving a match... needs some work can't believe no one has mentioned this before
Do you love self-improvement and mastering a skill? Look no further. Buy it and don't forget to laugh at how shit you are. This game is so entertaining. If you can, save gameplay of when you first start and you 3 months later. You'll be pretty amazed.
750 hours and still heaps more mechanics to learn and master. So much farther to go.

10/10 would spend another 750 hours playing.
Possibly one of the most unique games you can play right now. The skill cap is practically infinite, there are many different game modes to keep you interested, and overall its one of the best games out there right now. The only issue is the servers, as the U.S. West one's can be questionable to say the least and there isn't U.S. Central servers. Regardless I have 500+ hours in as of writing this and I don't intend to stop playing it any time soon. 9/5/10.
Everything is fantastic about Rocket League. Great game play mechanics, sound, graphics, animations etc. The only thing I don't care for is most of the music tracks but you can turn that off.

9/10
Yeah Yeah i love Rocket League, after 100 Hours of playing time i think i can tell that this game is very funny but not all the community ! It's a nice game but i bought keys to open so crates and i had blue things... My money RIP... After all, rocket league is a nice game and it's very cool when you play with your friends.
Simply put one of the best online competitive games out there. Better than just about any FPS game out there with salty losses and poo eating grins in victory I can't shout to the rooftops loud enough on how much you should get this game. Some people will not enjoy this game and that's to be expected with it's deceptively simple looking appearance but if you like to grind out and learn the hidden game mechanics this game is one of the most enjoyable games out there.
IT REALLY hurts me to write a bad review on rocket league as it has been my favorite game in the last couple years. 
but that would be my last hope for my voice to reach the developers as i'm even BANNED from accessing the support page in my country and they ignored me on twitter.
The game is really unique and tons of fun. the problem is Psyonix decided to make the online part unaccessable in my home country SYRIA. i know that transactions and trading is banned on my country and i understand that but come on , why would you ban me from even accessing the online matchmaking. this is really sad as i bought the game legally and enjoyed it alot offline.
dear PSYONIX , please remove the SYRIAN servers ban just on matchemaking , we DON'T want to trade items we just want to ENJOY your great game that we payed for
i'm in SYRIA and i can play MANY steam games online without an issue, But NOT rocket league... My favorite game :(
Great game. Queue times are outrageous. Once you get past Diamond 3 you stop getting matched. I'm lucky to play 10 games in 3 hours. Support is nonexistent; reports get ignored and nothing ever gets fixed. They're too focused on churning out cosmetics for Rocket Pass.
I absolutely love this game to death. The only and only reason I am voting this down is because the SERVERS are downright UNPLAYABLE. Been absolutely pathetic since the turn of the year. Get your shit together guys. You cannot have servers like that and hope to have people bear with it . GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER PLEASE.
Played this game for little over a half a thousand hours, from my experience you shouldn’t play competitive. If you make a single mistake, your whole team will degrade you. Casual is the way to go. Psyonix should for sure make it easier to ban/report people who choose to be toxic to anyone. I understand that there’s toxicity in every online game, but every other match there’s some sort of bullshit going on in the chat, whether to you or someone else. One time I ranked up from a Plat 2 div 1 all the way up to a Plat 3 div 3 due to all the forfeited matches (Furthering on the amount of toxic players)
In summary: If you want a casual game, don’t play rocket league.

Edit: I forgot to mention the gameplay, the overall game is actually very fun, hence the almost 600 hours I’ve put into it. The community is toxic, just like any other game. Turn off chat/ignore your team, but that goes to show how toxic the game is and it could ruin your performance in a match because you need to communicate with your team. I’m not recommending it only because of the community, but the actual game is very well done and enjoyable. Thank you for reading my review, if you feel that I missed/Stated something wrong, please comment below.

Last Edit: After talking to SunlessKhan about it, I have a slight change of heart. Your matches all depend on who you're playing with, that's the main factor. I however still won't give it a Thumbs up because of the people who make the game not enjoyable. Love you, Sunless <3
After reaching champ 3 Ive decided to put this game on a permanent backburner until Psyonix decides to stop forcing crates down our throats and diverts more resources to fixing their abysmal servers.
Great game, one of my favourite games to play with friends for sure. 
BUT, 200 hours into the game and the servers continue to run awfully. Constant spike lags when other players connect/ disconnect mid game and no fix yet. Plus toxic/ angry players ragequit the game at the last second all the time without any punishment or consequences which means the winning players keep loosing rewards. And of course I recommend this game to everyone who wants to have a good time with friends, I'm just reviewing this negatively because something needs to be done.
FUCKIN shit head game since they nerf the fact that you are playing with 12 years old kid saying at the beginning of the game I'M NOT PLAYING THIS ONE. i choose to forfeit and the option abandon is there. then i get banned for leaving a TEAMMATE in the ditch... right just fuckin get it like it was in the first place, ban people after the 3rd game of leaving abandonning for fuck sake
Game used to be really good, but since the last update its complete crap.... No engine sounds, the only thing u hear is boost sounds, physics of the game have changed
I'll admit, this is a great game, but I'm not going to recommend it solely because it forces you to pay for keys to open crates. There should be a way to earn them b/c i'm not going to waste my money on some cosmetics when I could be using it for something more useful. You already pay $20 for the game, so all that this is is a way to milk more money out of people. It's so common now that you can't miss it now even if your brain cells are dead.
I have almost 8 days of in game play time just on steam. I have also played around 10 days on ps4. The game servers and match making are by far the worst they have ever been since I have started playing this game.
For some time now I haven't been able to play Rocket League, I've only clocked 13 hours last year or so when I purchased it. I was looking to get back into it but as of late I've tried methods from three different Psyonix employees to try to get my game to run properly but nothing has worked. I don't know if anyone else has experienced trouble with games in general not running but I feel like I've tried everything. These are what I've tried.

Press the Windows key Type Windows Firewall in the search bar Select Turn Windows Firewall on or off

Also, please make sure to restore the factory defaults of the game settings: Open Steam and select the Library tab Right-click on Rocket League Select "Properties" Click "Set Launch Options", found under the "General" tab Type in: -autoconfig Click "Ok" Launch the game.



This game is great you will be having a great amount of fun playing it and its fun until u meet a player who ruins your game and u rage quit lol.
but as of recently the huge amount of server issue , Troll players ,slow matchmaking  
the game saying 0 Players in the game  while matchmaking or saying i am not logged into steam what the hell!!!
this is frustrating
now today i cannot even enter a game because of matchmaking issue ( Unable to contact matchmaking server , trying again ... (error 68) )

Fuck rocket league is best game in world, we want 1000 dollar back because I lost all to dumb Indian man. The dumb Indian man raped me and my uncle and made me very, very sad. If I don’t get my money back, my mom will shut down every rocket league server ever. thanks, BekezoMeade
First of all, this is one of those games you can just jump in and enjoy. It's unique, the physics are wonky but predictable, and the entire game play experience is great. If you wanted to hear the good, then stop reading here, because crap takes a turn for the worse in this game quickly.

That being said the actual players make this game almost unplayable. Hop in a random match with cross platform play enabled and you get stuck with a team of PS4 players who can't play the game, you lose miserably and learn nothing as you scramble to fix their mistakes. PS4 players get the game free with their PS membership, so you have a lot of new players all the time hopping on and the teams are horrible when cross platform play is enabled. Hop in a game without cross platform play and you find groups of players who would rather trash talk then play the game, let alone help your team. Just today I watched a team mate finish a goal and then watched another team mate refuse to play the rest of the match while continuously trash talking both me and his other team mate. It's hard to want to play a game where that's common, and it's common. Hop on competitive, first error a team mate or yourself make and you can watch at least one team mate leave the game immediately.

Too be clear, I want to love this game. I like sports games. I like racing games. I like PvP, but Rocket League is broken. I know they're trying to fix it. I know they put bans in place and they brag about their automatic ban system, but the community is still the community and it's horrible. It's worse than CS:GO, and that takes a lot of effort from a large group of players to be that bad.
uh good game, but i litterally just won two matches in a row mvp on both of them, and deranked after the second win so the ranking system is garbo ig

3 out of 5 ranked 3v3 matches never actually start because at least one out of six total players doesn't make it into the game. The game is unable to get SIX players into a the same match. Meanwhile there are battle royale games where over 16 times as many players are connected into the same match without issue, but six players is where this game starts to struggle.
My team mates keep getting worse and worse till i shut it off completely then it just stops no more bad team mates. weird right all i have to do is not play your broken matchmaking. If your thinking about buying this game i recommend not to...
My BFF does not understand that i have 20 hours in this game and he has 400+ hours and expects me to do well. I have almost made a noose with my shoelaces many times because he gets angry

John Gerbil if you see this i love you UWU Dx
This game should have come free with a burger king value meal. Apparently you get banned for cussing, which chat allows, but its ok to say your going to murder someones entire family. This game is an absolute joke, terrible servers,  horrible ranking system and the worst user base ever! They claim to hold a world championship, but getting there has little if nothing to do with skill and mostly to do with luck and connection priority.  Trash game, waste of time.
Badly coded mess.

I bought this game hoping it would run on my GNU/Linux installation. It didn't. At first, I got a laggy main menu because graphics were set to Ultra by default. Then, I changed my configuration to the lowest specs possible, which made main menu navigation possible. The moment I enter any kind of match, the game freezes and I have to restart my computer with Alt+SysRq+B. Also, it's laggy no matter what. I have <2 hours of "gameplay" (because I can't play) so I am considering a refund. Can you do something about the Linux release please? All of my other games work fine under Linux so this game is the exception rather than the rule.
worst game EVER all salty and cancer kiddos there !! 
you want cancer ?? yeeahh play rocket league ...disgraceful game and makers .... 
childs laugh ...RIP !!
wow, game is horrible, 10 for 10 losses in a row last time i played, they need to fix that like yesterday. No player should ever have to put the effort I put into getting those wins just to have them taken away due to lack of skill in every set of teammates I got for 10 teams in a row. I mean these people are damn potato brains that couldn't hit their own face with their own 2 fist if they tried. I get the most points every time and still stuck with the loss. You cant rank up having skill alone, you need 2 hunt 2 competent people like yourself down and build a team to get a win. It s a joke, I should be able to play alone and get a 50% win rate at the very least, I mean for fuck sake, the game stops being fun or having a point to playing when everything is a loss, especially when effort is put in......like what am I doing here playing a game that cant even toss me a 1 win in a 10 match stretch, give me a god damn break here.
Hope you all are having a nice day.

I don't typically leave reviews, but after playing this game for just under 100 hours, I felt compelled to leave a review. 

Pros - 

. The game is absolutely incredible. It gets your adrenaline pumping and your heart racing in the moment. Then it can just as quickly take it away and leave hollow disappointment when you miss that goal or you fail to block that shot.

. The graphics aren't terrible. For those of you ( like me! ) who are into the higher end graphics, with taxing games such as ARK: Survival Evolved, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Wildlands, Anthem, and more this game will be a bit of a strain on the eyes with the classy, flashy graphics. While they certainly suit the game nicely, they might now be everyone's cup of tea.

. Gameplay is fast paced, exciting, and fun. It's one of those games that's affordable to the common gamer, and you can easily play with friends. Especially with the new cross - platform party update recently ( this review written 2/21/19 ), you can even play with friends, regardless what size screen or graphical settings they're limited to ;)

Cons - 

. As a lot of other reviews have mentioned, the community. While the game itself is certainly worth the asking price, I'm not quite sure it's worth the drama. Simply put, if you've been playing the game a while, and already invested time, effort, and possibly money, it's worth holding on to and carrying on. If you're new to the scene, it's worthwhile taking a second take.

. Cheaters. Every game has cheaters, let's be honest. But Rocket League seems to bring a whole new tier to the meaning. Playing for the first few levels ( I'm currently level 44 ), the game seems fine. With the vile, rude, and toxic players aside you seem to have a fairly honest win / loss ratio relative to your skill. If you pick the game up quickly you'll be staring at victory after victory and the air horns will be singing your name. Vice versa, you could be looking at the darker "defeat" screen more often that one would like. Or, if you're like me you'll have a nice balance of both. Entering around mid-game however, the cheaters begin to emerge. Teleporters, aimbotters, players utilizing anything from lag switches to sticky cars begin to emerge. At first it can easily be dismissed as a bad match, but carrying on you'll notice players hitting the ball without boost towards their own goal, or towards an abstract wall only to seconds later have it flying into yours. Players who touch the ball, then have it "stick" to their car as they dive your goal over and over, hitting the ball with your own car resulting you flying off into space. Moments when you suddenly freeze, then un-freeze after a goal's been scored. ( my network ping is just fine, and all other games result in no similar issues. Drivers are up to date, etc. ) This repeats itself match after match so often it almost becomes humorous. I hope you get the picture.

Summary / Verdict - 

I believe there are better games out there.
Every day, I play less and less. 
This is the first time ever I have written a negative review, with that I said it all. Do not let my played hours fool you, this was a really fun game. I T W A S. Past tense. I literally lost all respect and simpathy for the game.
Unless you are ready to buy like 4 copies for a couple of friends of yours, do not buy it. This is the most CUCKED game I have ever played, let me elaborate.

I really loved the game back then, I didn't search it, it came to me as a gift. I kinda regret coming this far.

The idea, graphics and music are 10/10, the problem? This is no longer a enjoyable game.
At the beginning this was a real ESport, only skills matter. Right now it's just a total kinder playground safe zone lets gamble and buy seasonal pass game. Everything is a trigger, you cannot longer really interact to your team if you are just paired with people online, and be ready to literally lose an entire match just for telling someone on your team to go for the ball. The game is totally playable (almost) without any purchase at all, except the game itself (DIN DIN) but you will realize the game seems off.
The community is ok, every competitive game has it's toxic people, but the game has a problem where the Devs are trying to adjust it to become less and less humane so you can be just another car, because if, you have something to say, you will probably get a ''Chat disabled'' message anyway. Are you trying to congratulate a friend of yours? Get another ''Chat Disabled'' message. 
I am not even close to get banned, but since everything is a trigger now, I most probably will in a future, so Imagine buying a game just to get banned (not my type of game nu huh), the game seems dead off playing in literal mute all the time. I would have better play with the AI and pretend I am interacting with people online. Your own team won't even tell what you are trying to do because ''Chat disabled''.

It was once a game, now it is pathetic, I honestly think so. You might not really get what I am trying to tell you unless, you play the game, after just ONE match I am sure you will say ''Ahhh yeah this is what he was talking about''

You can still play it, but it wont be any fun. This is a no fun zone, only ''Pay seasonal pass, and become a robot to play'' zone. 

TLDR
Unless you are playing with your friends, in a closed game, and probably even not, you can have some fun on this game. This game leave me with a bitter taste in my mouth on every single update.
GG EZ PZ This game entered my heart as a jewel and left it as a garbage blob. Why couldn't it leave as a big one like TF2 for example.
Worst Games Ive Ever Played. Triple Digit Ping Servers, People all over the world connecting to US Servers, Virgin COmpany who is currently going out of buisness. Same Game over the years, nothings changed. All new Content is Paid For, Same Maps for 20 years LOL, Dead Game not worth 10 cents compared to other f2p games out there. Dont invest time and money on this pos game, its so fkn bad LOL
If ur looking for game to enjoy playing and ranking this is not for u 
Too many retards 
one more game I m done with just cozz retards and retarded ranked sistem
DONT PLAY THIS SHIT U WILL REGRET

Hell to the no
