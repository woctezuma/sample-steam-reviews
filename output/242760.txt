I generally hate survival games.  You know the ones i mean, the ones that became almost overnight megahits a few years back like Ark, Rust etc.  Anyone who's tried to actually play one knows spawn campers and the shoot on sight mentality makes it rough without a very large group.

I didn't expect to really, truly like this game as even without the PvP I thought it'd be the same tired old grind.  Chop down some trees, make a house, blah blah blah.  Jesus I was wrong.  First thing i noticed is the enemies are actually pretty terrifying.  I'd be chopping down a tree or hunting a deer and hear screeching from something that didn't even sound human anymore coming from way too close for comfort only for a mutant cannibal thing to leap out a tree at me and almost give me a heart attack.
 
This isn't something you ever really get used to either.  The mutants are unsettling as hell in the best way possible.  Sometimes they'll just watch you from the distance, sometimes they'll screech at you without attacking.  Even when you expect them to attack, they're stealthy as hell and almost always surprise me.  

It's also got the typical survival fanfare down to a science.  You're next upgrade is always right around the corner, but never easy to come by.  Combining that rock solid gameplay loop with terrifying enemies causes The Forest to transcend every other survival game I've ever tried.  It's fun, terrifying, and mysterious in the best way possible.  Cannot reccomend this game highly enough.

I highly recommend this game to anyone who can tolerate nudity and gore. This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day. 

The AI in this game is honestly the best I’ve encountered. The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you). The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there’s enough of them around however. There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I’m pretty sure they’re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves. Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you’re not careful, but they’ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they’ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape. 

Beyond the normal humanoid cannibals there are mutants who can always be found in caves, but will surface more frequently the more you piss the cannibals off. These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage. If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything down, I’ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my base, destroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base. The sumo dude doesn’t even need to do anything super special to wreak havoc, if he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops running.

How the cannibals interact with you is highly determined by your playstyle, though I don’t think they’d ever be friendly with you. If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalked, you can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routes, and they generally won’t find it unless you are followed home. If in contrast you do everything you can to piss them off (mass cannibal killings, mutant killings, effigy destruction and creation, burning their bodies in front of them), they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly. In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base, 1-2 armsies, and the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it’s been one at a time. Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutants, I can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map. You’re in control of how much you see them, which really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamic.
Multiplayer is significantly less “scary” but if you wanted to build massive bases it’s SOOOOOOOO much faster. It’s a lot of fun playing with friends and pissing mutants off but there is some charm lost from having others about in the forest with you. In single player the fear comes from the cannibals coming out of nowhere and overwhelming you, which really doesn’t happen in multiplayer. Sure when you’re in the caves they’ll still drop from the ceiling but when it’s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know it, diluting the terror. 

I know this “review” was all over the place but the game is definitely worth full price. I mostly just wanted to mention stuff that combats all the people saying they’ve never seen the mutants do much. It has the best music and you get a nice sense of accomplishment having to collect each cassette individually. 

I hope that the developers of this game will see this review. Please don't give up on this game. Please please continue to work on it and add on to it. This has to be my absolute favorite game to play with friends and with my Fiance. It keeps us interested, it definitely keeps us laughing, but I can't help to wonder and wish that it will become so much more than what it is. This game has SO much potential, and already it is doing extraordinarily good. I feel like we haven't even come close to exploring all that there is, but I can only hope that this easily becomes a game like Skyrim was for me. A game where I can spend hours and days on end just playing and enjoying this game. Great work, guys. Keep it up!!
TL:DR
It's worth the money in it's current state.
Fiddly building system that allows for very intricate base building.
Story is optional. No need to due anything story related in order to get all game content.
Regular updates.
Beautiful game.
Interesting crafting system.
You get to kill cannibals in ever more interesting ways. (This is worth $15 alone)
You get to hunt animals, use skins for crafting, and mount heads on wall of your house.
Co-op

Even in it's current state, EA, I feel I've gotten more than my moneys worth out of the game. I haven't finished the game yet, but I've seen videos of people who have. I'm more interested in base building and waging war on cannibals. There isn't much of a story. Your plane crashes, kid is abducted by cannibals, you need to save him. That's all there is to it. No quests or anything like that. As you explore you find pictures drawn by kids, and photos, and empty camps that show others have been here before you. You need to put forth a good effort to piece together a story. Almost like a detective. Find the clues to explain the situation. It's there if you want it, but seems to be something the devs threw in there as an afterthought. It's well done imo though.

As for the base building. It's a bit fiddly, and takes some effort to make a really intricate base. The system of base building allows you to build very complex bases though. Which is great for when you get a large group of cannibals attacking your base you can make all kinds of fun ways to trap or funnel them into choke points for maximum cannibal crushing carnage. After every update all the trees you've cut down will respawn. So getting a bunch of trees suddenly appearing right through the middle of your house is a possibility. Make sure you build your base around the trees you've cut down, just leave the stumps and build around them. Cutting the trees that are growing through structures will destroy the structure.

The crafting system is fun imo. No crazy animations or wait times for making rope, molotovs, axes, spears, etc. Just open the inventory and start combining ingredients. Certain herbs can be combined to restore health/stam. Combine 2 deer skin with rope and cloth to make a waterskin. Feathers and sticks to make arrows. Add cloth and booze to arrows to make fire arrows. A watch+coins+booze+circuit board to make a bomb. Add sap for a sticky bomb. Pretty simple. Once you add an item to the crafting mat in the inventory (just right click something to add it to the crafting mat, no clicking and dragging nonsense), a stick for example, a list appears telling you every item you can make using a stick. A bow, spear, upgraded spear, snowshoes, arrows, club, etc. It doesn't tell you which ingredients, or how many you will need to make each item though. So trial and error, or google, is needed. It's kinda fun. Almost like a mini game.

No voice acting, hand holding, tutorial (besides a very simplistic manual that explains the very basics), or anything like that. As soon as you wake up in the crashed plane you have the freedom to do whatever it is you want. No time constraints or anything like that. This is what i love about the game! Nothing is worse than having a 30 minute opening tutorial to explain that you have to eat/sleep/drink in order to survive. Also, no stupid plot points that open up more content. Like doing a certain part of the story in order to craft fire arrows or whatever.

The game is still being worked on with regular updates. Bug fixes and more content, like craftable/findable items, come every 15 days I think it is. Something like that. There are a few items that have no use. Snowshoes for example. I would imagine that you will need them in the snow areas, but in the games current state they aren't needed at all. I see this as a good thing. It means there's alot more tweaking and game mechanics to be implemented.

There is co-op but I've never played it. Therefore, I will leave this out of the review. Plenty of other reviews cover this subject I'm sure.

At the end of the day, it all comes down to if it's worth the money or not. In it's current state, I have gotten my moneys worth of enjoyment out of the game many times over. With more content and updates being added on a regular schedule It will only get more enjoyable.
The Forest is hands down the best Alpha game I have ever purchased. With that being said, i'd like to list the pros and cons of the game

[b]PROS:[/b]
-Open world sandbox survival done right

When I first got this game, I thought it would just be another one of those build a castle and live forever kind of games. I was wrong, thankfully. In The Forest, you can build incredible structures, but the enemies make your life difficult regardless of how good your defenses are. Want to eat but your food reserves are low? Too bad! There's a raiding party of 6 cannibals outside yelling at you about your destruction of the environment. The more you cut down trees and kil cannibals, the more enemies will come for you. It's like the EPA, but they're pissed off and want to eat you. The cannibals will hound you day and night, and they're crafty little things. They will gang up on you from all sides. Just when you thnk they've left and it's safe to kill that lizard that's been running from you for a week, they come out of nowhere and start beating you down.

-The story is actually amazing

You'd think that they would just make occasional tweaks to the AI to make them better at killing you, and that's it. But nope, the developers of The Forest actually made a compelling and interesting story (and it makes sense!). There's bits of lore to find everywhere. From caves, to boats, and sometimes just on the ground in select places. The game offers lots of foreshadowing and clues to what is really going on there. The games ending is just great as well. It answers damn near all the questions that I had asked about the game, but you know what the awesome part is? The ending is not an easy thing to get to! Why is that? Well I'll address it in my next point.

-Caves

I have a love hate relationship with caves. Caves are always scary, and it doesn't matter how much I've explored them. I STILL get spooked when I go into a cave I know I've cleared in search of some cans of coke and some TNT. There's an eerie feeling about the caves, because they're not just caves; they're breeding grounds and bases for the cannibals. There's noises that you think are cannibles breating, when in reality it's just sounds from the cave itself. Creaking, rocks falling, the occasional maniacle laughter. Oh wait that one is the cannibals, who are likely pissed that you're invading their home. These caves are also pitch black, did I mention that? you need to bring a torch, or 12. I mean, you really shouldn't go exploring in caves in anything less than full bone armor and the Katana or Modern Axe. Nah just kidding. You can explore them with only a lighter and your prayers, and you'll probably get eaten just the same. You know what really sucks though? All the best gear (and gear you need to beat the game) is located in the various cave systems.

-Co-op mode
Co-op is actually really good. You would expect it to be a glitchy, buggy mess (it's mostly not). The game is still terrifying and immersive, but now you're able to play it with friends! The scaries part of co-op isn't the cannibals though. It's guarding your food from your friend with the appetite of an elephant and the hunting skills of a quadriplegic.

[b]CONS:[/b]

-The AI seems to have very poor problem solving skills at times

While smacking the occasional turtle and using his remains to collect water, some cannibals might show up to fight you. This isn't a problem when you have traps though! You know what is a problem? The cannibals seem to have the deductive reasoning abilities of a brain dead alpaca when faced with traps. GRR GRR and BLEAT BLEAT will run head first into a trap while RAWR RAWR stays behind and watches his two friends get impaled. He then decides that it's an amazing idea to do THE SAME THING that they just did. It's not as bad now as it used to be in prior patches, but they still do stupid stuff like this.

-Weird ropes sometimes cause death falls

Sometimes when using climbing ropes, the game decides that you'd like to take a 5 story fall into a cave with a Virginia and her babies. It doesn't happen often, and has only affected me in Co-op games thus far, but it's still a massive pain in the ass (or legs, as it were).



I don't have anything else major that comes to mind. The Forest is an excellent game that, in my opinion, is an absolute steal at $15. This game gets a 9/10 from me. I took off a point because of the annoying bugs and glitches that occasionally happen. It is almost perfect, but missed the margin of perfection by just a hair. If you don't yet own the game, I would encourage you to get it. It's great by yourself and even better with friends.
This game has oodles of potential. Nothing more romantic than strolling down a sunset beach being chased by a bunch of naked cannibals. Makes you feel like a celebrity.

Depending on your nature I would suggest, if you are patient: You don't mind set backs,and have a good sense of humour. Get it now. It's pretty awesome even with all the flaws. Regular updates mean you're generally not stuck too long with one issue.. of course with each update you'll generally stumble upon something else to perplex you.. think of it as hurdles.. But everything looks pretty so that's okay.
 
If you don't enjoy being murdered by flying tables, eaten by land sharks, dislike leviatating geese, backwards rabbits and other such oddities then I suggest you wait it out till the game is more developed.


The Forest:

Day 1: I awaken from my inflight nap to find this creepy looking kid clinging to my arm.. I knew I should of paid extra for busniess class. I look around the otherwise empty plane. Where the fuck is my inflight meal and booze? there's a little turbulance and next thing we are minus half a plane and going down. Lol that kid isn't wearing his safety belt. He's screwed. We crash and I black out.

I awaken once again, to a near naked oiled up man-thing scooping up the unconsious child, this upsets me somewhat because now I have no one to offer as a peace sacrifice to the natives. After he runs off into the bushes with the kid I yell "SHOULD OF WORN YOUR SAFETY BELT YOU LITTLE SHIT" I help myself to numerous trays of inflight meals and booze glorious booze that due to some miracle survived the plane crash and are still sitting neatly on seats and shelves. I pick up random pill bottles and devour the contents and collect a pedometer from a foot, how ironic. Lucky for me, I am a paranoid survival enthusiast and was wearing my outdoor back pack complete with survival guide in preparation for this very event. 

Exiting the half a plane, grabbing a conviently placed fire axe fitted snuggly in that slack flight attendants chest, I raid a few luggage cases of the non existant passengers, mmm sexy panties. Wandering the beach at sunset, alchohol lines the beaches, natures natural drink cooler and notice a group of nudists. Fuck yes. This island is awesome. I run up to them waving my drink in greeting. The god of Tits and wine has blessed this place!! They stare at me like I am some kind of freak, probably because I'm wearing clothes and this has obviously offended thier religon because the nearest native attempts to claw my eyejellies out, shocked I hi 5 him in the face with my axe and the natives flee, shiny butts bouncing in the sunlight. 

I keep moving, being the survivalist I am I slaughter a few fluffy bunnies and a lizard, skin them and find a nice spot to set up for the night. I start a fire with my trusty everlasting lighter. Thank goodness they kindly let me bring my lighter aboard the plane! I build a small shelter out of sticks and cook myself a lizard, you can just taste the intestinal parasites! 

Day 2-4:

Not only am I a paranoid survival enthusiast. But I'm also an architect and master of construction! I have found a nice spot to start my new life here on this island, no point trying the planes radio, salvaging and rebuilding the yatch or boats I spotted on the beach or any of that shit.
I have lashed together some sticks to form a sturdy log sled! I have about 6 logs stacked ontop of the tiny twigs and another 2 logs carried by myself, with one arm. I push the sled along with the mere power of my pinky toe thankful for my Russian hertiage. I build myself a snazzy tree house because daddy issues meant I never had one as a child. I stash my porn in it along with the panties I salvaged from the wreck. I've got 4 walls, a drying rack, a fire, storage facilaties for my supplies, a freaking gazebo and a bunch of death traps surrounding my walls for those pesky natives, who despite the abundance of wildlife and edible plants, have opted for human flesh instead... Gotta hand it to them though, they have some really inspiring art peices, the man shoved through his own tennis rackets and every orifice crammed with tennis balls is my favourite, brings me to tears every time I see it. If I was going to make any effort whatsoever to return to human civilization, I'd totally steal some of thier work and sell it for millions. I've been working on my own style using the cannibals body parts, my centrepeice being 'head on a stick' I just can't seem to capture the same passions though.

Day 5:

Walls seem to be a weakness to the cannibals, they are in awe of them as they repeatedly ram thier faces into it, and growl at it. Small minded barbarians hahah.

It's not so funny when they walk through my wall... the sole source of my security.. but it's funny again when they walk into my campfire and burn to death. My emotional roller coaster of fun and fear may have something to do with my wandering through the forest earlier eating shrooms.
on my return to camp I accidentally walked into a fire, and caught fire to myself. In the rain. Adeles song has so much more meaning to me now. 

*TO BE CONTINUED*
This is seriously a real gem. Now, I don't usually like horror games/films/anything scary because I get minor heart attacks if someone as much as speaks or claps suddenly. That being said, my husband bought this game and I watched him play it. I was scared to death, but the more I watched the more I just couldn't keep my fingers off of it!

But to the point. Here are some pros and cons, but keep in mind that it is an alpha game.

Pros:
- Stunning graphics and environment. I was absolutely blown away, and I still am.
- Very real environment with wildlife offering food and crafting materials, nice weather and sound effects and more.
- The cannibals are an amazing and unique enemy. A breath of fresh air from zombies (which I am not very fond of). They are clever and tactical as well as primitive, and I am completely terrified of them! They have very smooth, elegant and agile movements, and they can be very sneaky. Watch your back while chopping wood for your constructions!
- While the environment is beautiful, you constantly feel tense and threatened by your sorroundings, whether it's movement in the distance, a shadow, a rustling of leaves or other sounds.
- The crafting system is lovely. You can spend a lot of time creating a nice base, and the crafting possibilities are ever improving with new content being added. Custom building can be slightly buggy, but I'm sure they will fix it and add to it.
- The game has a creative mode. I've seen a few people requesting this, probably not knowing that it already exists. At the start screen, simply type "veganmode" and you will not see any cannibals at all. This allows you to just enjoy yourself in peace if you feel like surviving and building. You may also type "vegetarianmode", if you wish for the cannibals to only be out at night, giving you a breathing space during the day. This is very lovely.
- The co-op version is a bunch of fun. It's a great experience to share with your friends - although you must beware that the co-op version is currently very buggy and laggy.
- Last but not least it really feels like the developers want to make this a top notch game for the final release. They regularly fix bugs while also adding new content like crafting and new places to explore.

Cons:
- I mentioned the co-op in pros, but as I also briefly said, it is very very buggy and laggy. Hopefully they will fix it, which I feel confident that they will. Also, you should note that there are currently saving problems with co-op. The host can save the game while in multiplayer, but your co-player won't be able to join the game again after quitting. The host can continue the game in solo mode, but not with friends. This is a shame. I very much hope they will fix this soon. [EDIT: I just managed to re-join a game that my husband had hosted earlier, so maybe it is possible. However, I started back in the airplane each time I rejoined. Either way, I'm sure all of this will be smoothed out eventually.]
- Buggy, glitchy, blah blah. It's alpha, it's to be expected. I don't think there are any game breaking bugs or glitches, though. If something is bugged, I haven't experienced not being able to fix it with a quick reload of the game.
- Currently you might be running out of content a little quickly. I believe they are working on making more content for the game. The boy from the plane who I believe must be the survivor's son is not currently to be found anywhere as far as I can tell from what I've seen and read. I would think they are working on making it a goal to find and rescue him from the cannibals, which would give the game some more sense of purpose. For now, it's just, scavenge, build, eat, drink, fight - survive. But I enjoy that :)
- The map is the same everytime you start a new game (although you crash in different places, and I think some cannibal buildings also are in different places). I don't necessarily dislike this, even though a new world every time would make exploring all the more exciting. However, I do hope that they make the map quite a bit bigger. If they don't you end up knowing the entire island in and out quite quickly, and then there won't be much exploring left to do. Making the island itself bigger would work, but making more islands to explore using your raft or whatever would be even more awesome. I have high hopes, but we'll see what the devs have in store for us. :)
- While the developers seem to be doing a magnificent job with regular updates, the game still seems to be far off beta. I am not sure how long we will have to wait. However long it is, though, I am completely sure that the end result will be breathtaking in every aspect. Keep up the good work, devs, you are doing so well!

I don't know if I covered everything, but this is all I can think of for now. I may update my review as more additions are made to the game. Overall, The Forest is a keeper. 10/10 shining stars from me despite the bugs and what not. I would highly recommend anyone who like survival/sandbox/horror games to buy this game - also during early access. The devs are clearly putting the money to good use, so I feel good about having offered them some support at this early stage. In fact, I was very surprised at how cheap it is. It almost feels like I robbed them!

Once again. 10/10, Buy it. Now.
I'm going to cover the least talked about subject of this game, which is the AI. It's a mixed bag, but nothing really stands out as 'bad'. In fact, besides a few pathfinding issues with large mutants, it's actually really good. It should be noted that I haven't completed a playthrough yet, but only because I'm a completionist and have not decided to climb down the hole yet.

In terms of the cannibals, they seem to act somewhat realistically. I play on hard mode, but...they seem to have a genuine interest in their own personal well-being. Now, I don't know exactly what attacks look like, since I built my base super strategically by hanging a bridge from the side of a cliff to a house built in the ocean, but I can describe my normal encounters on day 50+.

Now, about that sense that they indeed care for their own well-being. It seems possible to intimidate the cannibals simply by not backing down, and holding your ground when they rush at you, and rushing at them back. You can do this dance of feint rushes to make them hesitant in attacking you. If you just run, they will be encouraged to attack you. If you strike out against them defensively, they will also be encouraged to attack you.

But, if you pick your targets carefully (such as only attacking the one that musters the courage to attack first of the group, or the strongest member of the group), the rest will become fearful. You can then take them down one by one until they flee. You can then flee yourself, otherwise they will come back. Or you can wait...depending if you need more bodies to burn... >:)

It's best to try a 'no-f*cks given' approach when dealing with the cannibals. I've literally kept working chopping down trees like nothing was wrong when surrounded by cannibals. Now, if they bring a fire-thrower with them, it changes the dynamic a little bit, because then the cannibals are under the misconception that ranged attacks are safer to perform than melee attacks. But if you chase them down, well, then they were wrong.

It's also possible to take a break in combat, if you've beaten the heck out of everyone. Bashed and bruised, even a large group will stop attacking if you clearly had the upper hand, and they have no more ranged members. You can just sit on a bench to recharge your stamina, and everybody can just chill for a bit. Then you finish it.

Basically, it is possible to have a 'terrifying presence' in this game like Fallout, but you gain it by actual ingame ACTIONS, not stat points. It is possible to make even a large mutant run away (believe me, they're faster than they look, lol. Tried to run it down, but it just disappeared).

Now, before anybody is under the false impression that the game is easy, I've played in multiplayer. My bro and I would wander off by ourselves, and be fine. But three or four of his friends sticking together? They're constantly dying. That's because they aren't playing the mind game with the cannibals. It's like they know whether you're afraid or not. And whether or not you're going to make them eat that club of theirs. Being smart is heavily rewarded in this game, and numbers aren't going to be an easy route to victory.

There is a few flaws with the AI, most notably when it comes to large mutants and caves. I mean, I suppose it's difficult for them to pathfind down there sometimes, and they aren't going to climb. Combined with what seems to be an intimidation system, you can end up with situations where a large mutant will simply stand there and stare angrily. On the other hand, there are genuinely unexpectedly 'smart' moments. Once a feral cannibal followed me home, and I turned around to see where it was hiding now. It popped its head up from behind a rock to peek at me in a humerous fashion, reminding me of a ferret or a groundhog. Shame they had to end up in the fire pit...
Didnt realize I never left a review.

Great game.
Biggest praise and something I feel must be stressed is the AI.
I have never played a game with such lifelike AI. 
The way they move, act, react, cry, yell...It makes the whole game go on another level.
Forget stupid \Dino's getting stuck in trees, Forget Zombies not being able to get up ladders.
These NPC will blow you away with there eerie portrayal.

More then worth the price of admission for the AI alone.
Luckily the rest of the game is solid all around.

Pouring one out for you every day Franklin.



Still haven't saved my son, still avenging Franklin.

Rate: 8/10
For $15 they could have removed the cannibals altogether, renamed the game ''camping simulator'' and it would still be better than most games of double the price.
How many people have you seen in the review section with 100 hours? That's right. But I'm not just going to be one of those people who just says, "Yeah, its ok i guess," hinting at their 10000 hours. Before I go into the review, I would like to give some context. So, I bought this game around v0.03, and I spent a lot of time just base building, not really caving 'cause I be a wus. Finally, a while later, I saw the game was at v0.29. That was when I added 80 hours to my game time.I know the location of every useful item, I have gotten down into the sinkhole, found and alternate route to the katana, ect. I have enjoyed every last bit. I'm a bit bored, and waiting till v0.31 to see what it brings, but for know, I will just review.

Pros
-Can run on a potato, but expect some VERY scaled down resouldtion. I mean like 520x420. But that is an extreme.
-Can be very smexy, at 1080p with ultra settings, it is truely gorgeous, but you need a supercomputer.
-The building system is very flexable. There is very little snapping, and that is somehing I like.
-I know it was added forever ago, but multiplayer was probaly the most beneficial thing to this game. Ever.
-It's fifteen f*cking dollars! FOR ALL OF THIS!?
-Still in alpha stages, so more could be added. (Though I have played more hours of this than there are hours of Dishonored's campaign, so its already worth my money.)
-Great community, unless you join a game with a five-year-old who says, "Your in big trouble," and kicks you from game. That legitimately happened before I wrote this review. Srsly. Give me a reason.
-Multitude of collectable items.
-Interesting lore, or so I think. There is no wiki page, so you have to explore and find all the burial sites and photos to figure it out yourself. I could be way wrong. Look at the end of this review for my personal opnion on the story.
-Devs are fantabulous. Thats not a word.

Cons
-It is in alpha, so there is more to be desired.
-When running The Forest on PotatOS 6.7 [Like that pun :3= ?] and you have it in low res mode, it is so pixelated, my friend thought that a tennis ball was a lemon, and proudly proclaimed, "This is my lemon!"
-Feels a but empty once you have gotten to the sinkhole. So don't rush to get in there.
-The inventory system is set up so you can carry a certain amount of a certain item. It is always the same. The katana goes to the upper-left, the rebreather next to it, you can only carry 5 dynamite, ect. The downside in this I find is the lack of inventory management. It might just be me, but I relish in the orginazational pleasure of shifting item around in my inventory to make room for new ones. Maybe it is just me and I'm a weirdo, but it's a con for me so it's on the list.
-Want an axe for a weapon! No... well, tough luck. Katana is a bit later game so...
-I like a heavy focus on the range of items and fauna to be found in a game. The game is doing better, but my soul is a void, so keep adding to fill it devs :3=

Lore- The sinkhole is called a cetone` in the patch notes, which is a Mayan word for abyss. These cetone`s formed in the yucatun peninsula in Mexico. This said, the area is not an island, but is blocked of by a mountainous region, indicating it is the southern yucatan peninsula. The compass points north to the mountains, so it must take place in the southern region of Guatamala. The Cetone`s were worshiped by the Mayans. This must mean that the massive Cetone` in the middle of the map was a hub of mayan civilization, as the cetone` there is many times bigger than any one in our knowledge, as they are generally only 30 feet deep. Perhaps a strange a race had hid in these caves and slowly mutated over time to adapt to cannibalistic dietary habits. As the Mayans discovered the place, they also discovered its unruly inhabitants. Perhaps that was why the Mayans disappeared. As memory faded of the hellish place, the sinkhole was rediscovered and put on the front pages of caving magazines worldwide. As you explore, you can see evidence of early 20th century spelunking equipment. After the explorers never returned, the incident was forgotten, and became a sort of 
bermuda triangle. In 1982, a family went on a boat trip to explore the region. They lost thier son and looked for him. It is assumed he was eaten. The grave near the yacht may show that one of the parents died by starvation. The final parent is gone without trace. The several campgrounds indicate people who explored the region, not believing the rumors of cannibals. A film crew's camp can also be found by Goose Lake. James Blanc (you) and Timmy Blanc (your relative) crash in the forest. The Virginias, or six-legged female mutants, are the only cannibals with genitalia, indicated that the malformed cannibal babies surrounding them are its offspring.

Like this review so others can see and revise my theories. Farewell dear walri.
So I am trying to introduce my wife to the gaming world. We already tried bunch of games, and it was clear she is digging survival games. Don't Starve is way tooooo deep and complicated, even for an experience gamer, minecraft has perfect mechanic but graphicaly...not everybody can enjoy it, Rust - sadly no pve content, Ark - fuck this game. Me and my wife are using laptops, I have laptop  with GTX 860m, I know it's out of date, but still I am able to launch all new games with good fps after playing few minutes with settings, but ARK is unplayable. And finally I bought forest, and this game is awesome. There are still some bugs in this game, and feeling of unfinished product doesn't leave you during gameplay, but it so good in coop. Crafting is so intuitive. We almost never need to trade stuff because all people in coop mode see each others blueprints and can just add their materials. This thing made this game for us. It's still to difficult for my wife to use blueprints, difficult to understand mechanic of survival, but she is enjoying gathering resources, and exploring, and most important, she can craft by herself because she sees my blueprints and be part of the team. So yeah, this game is worth it price.
I was on the fence about buying this game.  Last night at about 9pm me and 2 friends were bored: "13 bucks, only 1.4 gigs? Let's try it."

6.1 hours, 2 times getting yelled at to stop screaming by my parents, 1 pants-wetting, countless logs, and 14 episodes of stepping backwards into the campfire later, I finally get to bed.  Flash forward 4 hours, when I have to get up for work the next morning.  Currently half awake at my desk with demonic screams filling my ears, and visions of tentacles dancing in my head.

I give this game 13 tennis balls out of 11 topless tribal mutant ladies
I highly recommend this game to anyone who can tolerate nudity and gore. This can be just a survival game as you can turn the cannibals off on the main menu, but to me the cannibals are the meat and potatoes of this game and I find myself sorely missing them should they not come visit me a couple of times a day. 

The AI in this game is honestly the best I’ve encountered. The game now features different types of cannibals with tribes that will fight if you watch silently, but will mostly unite in their hatred of the guy deforesting their land, (you). The cannibals will still throw a couple of punches at each other if there’s enough of them around however. There are starving cannibals who will try to stalk you to find out where you live and try to scavenge off any kills you make, scouts for larger tribes who will often simply run away to alert others of your locations, hunting parties (though I’m pretty sure they’re only hunting you), and cannibals just trying to live out their lives in peace that you can finding sleeping in camps or caves. Cannibals will duck and roll to evade attacks, climb trees to escape, light tennis balls on fire and throw them at you, wreck your base if you’re not careful, but they’ll also do things like drop effigies which you can catch them praying at if left uninterrupted, they’ll drag their wounded out of battle if they can, and will run off to retrieve others if you let them escape. 

Beyond the normal humanoid cannibals there are mutants who can always be found in caves, but will surface more frequently the more you ♥♥♥♥ the cannibals off. These (with the exception of the babies) are significantly tougher to kill and do a lot more damage. If they come near your base they mean business and while the spider mutant takes a couple of hits to tear anything down, I’ve seen armsy rip a tree OUT OF THE GROUND and slam it into my base, destroying multiple defensive spikes and walls allowing the small army of ten or so he brought with him entrance into the base. The sumo dude doesn’t even need to do anything super special to wreak havoc, if he runs at your base everything in his path will be destroyed until he stops running.

How the cannibals interact with you is highly determined by your playstyle, though I don’t think they’d ever be friendly with you. If you escape the plane crash quickly before they find you and are not stalked, you can have the opportunity to build a base without their knowledge if you pick a private enough location not on one of their common routes, and they generally won’t find it unless you are followed home. If in contrast you do everything you can to ♥♥♥♥ them off (mass cannibal killings, mutant killings, effigy destruction and creation, burning their bodies in front of them), they will be significantly more inclined to bother you constantly. In my current single player game I see at least 4-6 spider mutants a day somewhat near my base, 1-2 armsies, and the sumo dudes have only just started coming out so luckily it’s been one at a time. Even though I am absolutely plagued by mutants, I can always ghost them and move to a different part of the map. You’re in control of how much you see them, which really makes the game AI feel more real and dynamic.
Multiplayer is significantly less “scary” but if you wanted to build massive bases it’s SOOOOOOOO much faster. It’s a lot of fun playing with friends and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mutants off but there is some charm lost from having others about in the forest with you. In single player the fear comes from the cannibals coming out of nowhere and overwhelming you, which really doesn’t happen in multiplayer. Sure when you’re in the caves they’ll still drop from the ceiling but when it’s two against three your odds are a lot better and you know it, diluting the terror. 

I know this “review” was all over the place but the game is definitely worth full price. I mostly just wanted to mention stuff that combats all the people saying they’ve never seen the mutants do much. It has the best music and you get a nice sense of accomplishment having to collect each cassette individually.
Enjoy the peaceful, relaxing woodlands in a sandbox game? The gentle breeze mixed with the chrips of brids. Then the birds stop, your heart stops. Oh dear its a horror game. The first time i played this i refused to leave the plane until morning. Rigid with fear i practically forgot to breathe, a more peaceful death than the tearing actions of the friendly neighborhood mutant. However as the days pass by you eventually find yourself turning into the joseph stalin of the island and rule with an iron fist, decimating anything that dares move. In all honesty the games actually decent, not going to lie just the tree chopping mechanic had me amazed for a solid few years, only getting over how good it is now with the help of a psychiatrist. Would terrify myself again. Would recommend.
TL;DR: This game is intense and rewarding for smart playstyle, even in Alpha. Great Dev support as well.

======

I woke in a broken plane, only to scavange what was left because I was hungry and hurt. Popped a few pills and jumped out of the plane's hull before seeing scattered suitcases everywhere. Each one of them seemed locked, but my trusty axe I found made quick work of them. Found tennis balls in a few, didn't know Roger Federer was onboard. Must of been in first class. 

Being the Natural hunter I was, I beat Lizards and a few bunnies to death with a makeshift club I wrapped in cloth. Skinned them and saved their meat for later. Slapping the freshly carved Lizard's skin on like armor as a sick man I am, I continued to kill its bretheren until I was covered with their protective armor. I dipped myself in a fresh found pool of water near a large tree I couldn't cut. Oddly, I found a makeshift spear inside. Mine. Totally took that shit. And then I was met with a shriek off in the distance. Wolfs? Cyotes? Roise O'Donald? Either way, I was scared shitless as night started to fall.

Fast forward a day, after finding a large cliff side with one walkway from behind me for anything to sneak up, so I decide to build a defensive wall to close it off. I take to the nearby forest with a newly made log sled to transport trees back to my new base. A fire pit and Hunters shelter is made. I stow away rocks and sticks I have in excess there incase I need to build anything else. I light up the fire pit and cook a bunny on it, eating it before I huddled up in my shelter for the night. 

I woke in the night, only to be met with two sets of beady eyes glistening across my fire pit in the darkness. I pull my axe out in hand, hearing them hiss. Humans? They looked the part, but said nothing to me. One cries out as it dashes for me, I raise the axe and block his advance. I chop the axe into this crazed man, beating him back a few times until he fell to the ground. His friend hissed at me and ran on all fours away into the woods. What the fuck did I just kill, Smeagol? 

Fast forward about three more days, I have my rear and front defensive walls built out from the steep cliff side to the oceans waters, only one way in. Its safter to light fires at night now and sleep, since the locals seem afraid of this place. I set out on foot, spear in hand and covered in mud and deer hides to keep me warm. I had to find their village. After evading a few patrols of the locals, I stumbled into three huts and what looks like to be a large den. Looking into said den after ghosting around the town to make sure no one is there, I enter to only find a noose to greet me. And another man hanging. I cut the rope to use to my gains. I quickly pull a stick together with cloth and rope to make me a shortbow. And all those fucking feathers, now into arrows. Seriously, I had about two hundred of them. Making a few I test fire the bow. We're good to go. The srieks come back in the distance, I bolt back home. 

Day... I don't even know. Sun has come and gone so many times now. Traps lingering in the forest just ouside. Effigies planted about fifty yards out from the front of my gates, only to be mimicked the same way by the locals across the way. They want to show their territory. I disobey. Covered in my lizard armor and deer pelts, I stalk upon a patrol not far from my home. I wait until two break off from the group, while I keep my watchful eye on them from the hilltop bushes. Bow in my hand. The two stop near a pool. I pull tension on my bows string, lining up a shot. Release. Arrow pegs the local in the head and drops. His friend panics, only to be met with me, silently springing from the bushes with spear. His limp body drops into the pool of water. I make effigies of their corpses. 

War rages on and I begin hunting at night. Traps litter segments around the forest closest to my home. I draw them out of hiding with a simple fire. I wait. I watch. They come. Throwing a rock their way grabs their attention, turning towards me. I shoot a arrow at the leader of this five man pack. All hell breaks loose. I slink my way down hill side in the darkness, as they follow close behind. I slip past two traps. One of the locals gets hung up in my noose trap, as two more grouped together and get impaled on my spike trap. Leader and croney is left. I peg the leader two more times with arrows until he drops. Small one begins to run. I draw my bow, having a clear shot. I don't take the shot. I let him run. Let him tell the others that I will not be hunted so easily. 

In this forest, you either die as the hunted, or you live long enough to see yourself become the hunter.

10/10 - Would Crash Again. 

---------------------------------------

(( Serious number: 9/10 )) Game is in /alpha/ and already this intense. I was thinking 8.5/10, but for the $15 I spent on it? And its only getting better every day with constant updates and helpful feedback from the devs? No. It deserves the 9. And it can only really go up from there. Cannot wait to see final product and additions made.
The Forest is one of the rare games that achieve the ideal effects of Early Access function.
Unlike many dead projects and ideas, the developers set deadlines and time frame for updates.

[strike]With each updates, more contents are added and bugs are fixed. When it first started, the forest, as a game, was small and had very limited content. Now, the game has been developed to a state where it can sell as a non-Early-Access game, and I'd have no complaints at all.[/strike]

The Forest is a complete game. There are stories to follow, objectives to do, places to explore, things to collect and craft, and so on. Graphics are beautiful; Top-tier for Unity engine. Physics are there and working perfectly. Survival aspects make sense. Crafting is enjoyable and simple to learn. Atmosphere is impeccable.

[strike]If you are wondering whether you should buy the game or not, buy it. Do not be scared by the long development time and the Early-access title. You are getting a fully functioning game, and it is a very very good one.[/strike]

1.0 is here!! Cheers to developers for keep the price low and still improving the game through regular patches.

10/10, as everyone else said, Early-access done right.
Overall The Forest is a great game.
The Highest Perks:
- Building
- Creative 
- Crafting
- Teamwork
- Bugs (Sometimes can be fun) 

Developers are always bringing out updates/bugfixes every couple of weeks
Most importantly they always seem to listen their community adding suggested features.
Good Developers =)

[h1]An incredible experience from start to finish. And one of the very few games that I consider to be a steal even at full price.[/h1]

I always imagined myself being stranded on a beautiful tropical island. What would I do ? What would I eat ? How would I escape ?

The answers to all of these questions a lot more lie in The Forest. All of my fantasies came true when I first started the game and I saw what it was capable of. Everything from visuals, to sounds and gameplay just blew my mind. It is so chock full of content that even after 175 hours of play time, it [i]still[/i] manages to scare and surprise me. 

For just $20 you get access to:
[list]
[*]Fully fleshed out survival experience with multiple endings
[/list]
You will embark on a challenging quest to find your missing son. From the top of the mountain to the very bottom of the sinkhole. Fight your way through, sneak by unnoticed or [i]deceive[/i] your enemies. Build up your arsenal of weapons and tools. Hunt and gear up, become stronger, faster and more resistant. Build a home, set up walls and traps, go fishing, try out some of the local berries and mushrooms, build a boat, try out the diving gear or bring hell and distruction upon the nearby enemy camps. All up to you. 
[list]
[*]Single Player and Coop
[/list]
I really enjoyed my first full single-player playthrough. And after that I was ready to join my friends on their adventures too. There's nothing more fun than exploring legitimately scary caves together. Or fulfilling your lifelong dream of becoming an all-star lumberjack crew. Building, trading, healing and fighting together is all incredibly fun in co-op.
[list]
[*]An extensive crafting system
[/list]
I don't think I've ever seen this many original and creative items to be used in survival game before. I've seen a lot of interesting props in other survival games before. But The Forest is the first one I've seen where you can actually use them. You can gather all sorts of useful things in this game. Including: weapons, armor, food, consumables, explosives, crafting materials, wearables, collectibles, dead body parts, maps, keys and much much more. And the best part is that almost all of them can be combined or used together in some way. You can craft all kinds of makeshift tools and deadly weapons. And those weapons and tools can then themselves be upgraded.. It's insane.
[list]
[*]Unique fauna and flora
[/list]
This island is.. unnatural. There's way, way more than meets the eye. There's sunny beaches, deep lush forests, misty mountain ares and more. But beneath the island's mystery there lies a hauntingly beautiful paradise. With lots of interesting animals and critters. Who all have their own unique AI and preferred environments. Deer, rabbits, lizards and raccoons are but a few of the many beautiful creatures this game has to offer. These animals become an essential part of the player's survival. As some of them can be exploited for food, hide or other crafting materials. Hunt, trap or breed your own, whichever you prefer. Farming and growing your own plants is another great way to stock up on food and healing herbs.
[list]
[*]Exploration
[/list]
Golden beaches, deep lush forests, misty mountains and obscured caves. All very believable and extremely well designed. I once spent 15 minutes just holding W and looking UP while walking circles in a pine forest. It was [i]that[/i] beautiful. The wind in the bushes, the branches tapping against the trees, the birds singing their last - all a joy to behold. And a blissful retreat for your ears. 

Nothing in the world compares to the tense feeling a player gets upon their first descent into these dark dripping caves. It's like entering a completely remote, uncharted territory. Their territory. Will you use a bright torch and risk being seen ? Or stumble in the dark, risking to fall to your death. Or will you throw a flare in order to create a distraction perhaps. All up to you. I both love and hate the cave system. I love it because it's really spooky and there's never a dull moment down there. But I hate the helpless feeling of being disoriented, confused and utterly lost within it's never ending branching corridors. But maybe that's exactly the point. To make you feel tiny and suspicious of every shadow and echo. 
[list]
[*]Combat
[/list]
Let me just start with the fact that there are a lot of weapons in this game. Some you can craft, and some you have to find. But they all have one thing in common - they're effective and very satisfying to use. Some weapons are better at blocking, while others excel at slashing or dismembering your enemies. You have both ranged and melee. As well as some.. unique items. These bows and spears and axes can be upgraded or enhanced in some way. Like covering your axe with a piece of cloth covered in alcohol and then lighting it on fire. Or using custom arrows, that can poison your enemies or straight up light them on fire. Very diverse arsenal, with a few very welcome surprises.
[list]
[*]VR
[/list]
And if all of the above wasn't enough -- this game comes with a fully working single-player/coop VR mode. I tried it myself, and it is shockingly good. Even more so than a bunch of exclusively VR games. It totally nails the movement system, the arms, looking around, fighting, collecting stuff, everything. It is so much fun! And the best part is that you can actually play with people who don't own a VR too. And they can see you chop down a tree in real time, as you flail around in real life. Extremely well done, I'm addicted and I spent at least 8 hours this week in The Forest VR alone.



[b]In conclusion:[/b]

This game is something special. One of the very few titles who not only made it out of Early Access with flying colors. But also manages to release regular updates, always on time and with great success. In fact they actually coded in a countdown timer in the game itself. Letting people know exactly when the next update is due.

Free content and updates, patches and hotfixes, helping users on the forums -- Endnight Games has done it all and continues to do so to this very day. They are a model development team and their game is 100% worthy of your time and money. 

I strongly recommend this game to all survival genre fans that love playing polished, finished products. Who are creative with their resources and are not afraid of a challenge. People who love an adventure that keeps them on their toes and rewarding those who are brave enough to take a leap of faith into the unknown.
I felt I could finally write a review after almost a year hiatus to allow The Forest to develope.  

Pros:
-Beautiful graphics
-Crafting system (Somewhat complex & engaging)
-Great building system
-Multiplayer/Co-op
-Great game environment (cave exploration, abandoned campsites, etc.)
-Variety of enemies
-Hunger/thirst system
-Size of game world

Cons:
-Enemies:  Mutants (cannibals) serve as the antagonists of The Forest.  They are curious, fierce, and unrelenting.  While combat is tough and fun, the occurance of the mutants I feel is too high right now.  I find now you have to hurry even more than in previous versions to establish a fortified base.  Have had to restart several games after being swarmed within the first two days.
-Multiplayer:  Another pro that is also a con.  Multiplayer has come a significant way since fall of 2014.  Back then multiplayer was practically unplayable.  Now, multiplayer adventures are fun yet there still exist syncronicity issues with host and client.  Still enjoiyable, but has some kinks to iron out.
-General Early Access bits:  Some annoying glitches and crashes still exist, and The Forest still needs to be fully optimized.  

Overall, The Forest is a great game to play alone or with others.  A year ago I would not recommend The Forest, but would adivse prospective buyers to wait.  However, the game has made huge hauls and now I do recommend The Forest.

8.5/10 as of v0.28
Hands down one of the greatest games I have ever played.  I have been playing The Forest almost from the beginning.  I began by watching Kage848 and GameEdged.  Those two got me interested in the game in the first place. 

The First Night.
I built a small wall against a cliff with an opening covered by a standing fire, which saved my life as it didnt take long for the natives to find me....and they will find you.  The fire proved to be a good way to keep them at bay, but gods was it terrifying.  
My first encounter, as I was running around the opening of my wall, was a dirty, hideous woman screaming in my face.  She struck at me once and I retreated up the cliff face, nearly falling to my death several times. All the while I could see the woman below me, running around on all fours screeching an awful noise, which attracted more of them.  As I reached the midway point of the cliff face, looking down, I could see several figures approaching through the trees in the pale moonlight.  One seemed to have a flashlight of some sort above his head.  The others noticed me atop the cliff and hooted and hollered most of the rest of the night, leaving me just before dawn as I was able to complete the climb up the cliff, and disappear out of view.  

A few days passed before I had another encounter, this time I thought I was ready.  I had built several traps atop my cliff, which was surrounded on 3 sides by a sheer face.  The top of the cliff had a quaint little pond with several gleaming fish slowly swimming around their isolated home which fed me, along with the squirrels and rabbits for a few days.  Many trees dotted the edge of one side of the escarpment , while the other side was bare, giving me a beautiful view of the turbulent ocean below, which turned out to be my only escape....

I awoke one morning to a bleak and rainy day, the fires of my torch would not stay lit, and I was cold.  I managed to craft some rabbit skin boots which aided slightly in warming my blue, shivering body. As the day wore on and the night creeped in, I crafted a decent fire, which I refused to use in the beginning for the fear of attracting more of the monstrosites which chased me to the top of this cliff.  As I looked off in the distance, over the rolling hills of the accessible side of my little moutain camp, I could make out several shapes heading my way. The night was approaching quickly and I could barely make out the group which was dead set on my camp. One appeared to be much taller than the rest, and the smaller ones were scurrying around the hulking figure very quickly, and with reckless abandon.  As they came closer I could see that the figure in the middle was not a man....but a woman.  I could barely make out 6 legs before the monster reared up and began to charge my way, with demonic speed and an intent to flay me alive. I had only a stone axe, and the plane axe in which I found after the devastating crash. I knew I was in trouble, and as I fought bravely, the group was too much. I turned and ran off the edge of the cliff, jumping for dear life into the ocean below....The screeches of the ugly monsters trailed closely after me as I plummeted into the icy depths of the waters that imprisoned me here.  Sadly I did not reach deep enough water, and the fall slammed me into unconscienceness.  

I briefly awoke being dragged through the forest by two tribal looking men.  Each had one of my wrists, and I could hardly make out what they looked like underneath the canopy of trees.  Unconscienceness creeped over me again, and I succumbed to the fading of my vision.

When I awoke for the second time, I could not see anything. I could hear the twisted echoes of screams all around me, off in the distance.  So far but seeming so close.  I pulled out my lighter which took a while to spark.  As the small sparks caught with fuel and the flame burst forth illuminating my body and surroundings, I realized I was hanging from a ceiling inside a cave.  As I looked around I could see the fleshy chunks of my plane comrades.  Bloody skulls littered the floor and here and there an arm or leg protuded from a giant pile of flesh and bile.  I noticed my plane axe was on the floor just below me, I reached for it and cut my bindings.  I fell with a hard thud to the cave floor and my lighter went out.  It would not ignite again.  I noticed a dim light off in the distance and began to head towards it, all the while not noticing the dangling rope behind me that would lead me out of this hellish underworld.  Venturing further and further down, the rope faded from view, and the screams echoed louder.....and louder.

So if this sounds cool, and you have the chance to play The Forest blind, buy this game.  You will not be disappointed. Thank you to all the developers for making such an amazing, terrifying, wonderful game.  I look forward to seeing more from Survivalist Gaming and Endnight.
You will get two types of experiences when playing this game depending on how many people you play with. Either way, it's a great game.

Experience 1: (Playing alone or with 1 other person) It will be a horror/survival experience. You are doing everything in your power not to get killed by bloodthirsty cannibals while trying not to die of hunger or thirst.  You will be sh***ing yourself at night hearing them scream and shriek out in the woods as you huddle next to your dimly lit fire, waiting for the sun to rise. Your morality will wither as your belly aches and there just happens to be a nice corpse at your camp from the other night’s frightening raid. At some point you will find a cave and muster up the courage to go inside, then immediately regret your decision and return to your camp, waiting for the end to come. The enemies with get stronger, faster and smarter as you get weaker and beaten down.

Experience 2: (Playing with 2 or more people) Everything is reversed. Now the cannibals should be fearing you. You and your crack team of wonder dads, all looking for the same child you somehow fathered together. You with proceed to murder and destroy everything in your path like a force of nature and the caves will become your hunting grounds. Life is your b**ch and soon you will come to discover that maybe the cannibals aren’t so bad after all, and maybe you and your ravenous chums are the real threat to these once peaceful people. F**k everything.  Kill everything. Eat everything. You and your pals will be the next horseman of the apocalypse until you son is found. Liam Neeson doesn’t have half the particular set of skills you and your friends bring to the table.
Best survival game I've played so far, so immersive. The devs are killin' it with all those frequent updates, I enjoy this a lot. The gameplay is smooth and very well optimized. This game is a bang for your bucks, keep up the good work devs !

[h1]15/10[/h1]
I haven’t played this game since early 2016. Now that the game is released I’m coming back for a review. 

This is quite possibly one of the most underrated games on Steam. The Forest is what every online survival game should aspire to be. Being a single player/co op game gives it some advantages however. 

Graphics-9/10
The world is vast and beautiful in its own way. Character models are outstanding. Cannibals look creepy as f*ck. The trees blow in the wind, the waves move separate from your character so it gives you the feeling of actually swimming in dangerous waters. It’s by no means next gen, but being a game that released years ago in EA it’s still one of the more fantastic looking games on Steam.

Atmosphere-10/10
There’s nothing I can really say untill you try the game yourself. The Wilderness feels lonely, cold. The cannibal caves are incredibly scary. Each little abandoned camp you find in the wilderness has its own eerie sense of dread. Villages looked like they were/are lived in. This is quite possibly the highlight of the game. The environment in the Forest is expertley crafted.

Gameplay-8/10
Combat at the start of the game is great. Melee has weight to it. Bows feel nice to shoot. As the game progresses Combat Can get repetitive. You’ll end up killing boatloads of Cannibals and after the first 10 days or so you’ll start to get a little bored. Luckily building is not only balanced but deep. You don’t have a ton of different materials to work with so the building is limited in variety but The Forest gives you all the tools you need to create your camp. Want a big fortress with arrow towers? You can build it. Want a small hunting camp that allows you to stay on the move constantly? You can build that. Want a sweet boat house that allows you to travel the shores of the island? You can build that. Want a quaint log cabin that reminds you of the old country? You can build it. 

The game gets more challenging as time goes on and depending on the way you’ll play you’ll either be taking on Armors of Cannibals or sneaking around them. Stealth is as important as combat and works well enough. 

There’s lots to explore, caves, landmarks, boats, lakes, mountains. In a seemingly empty Forest the devs have managed to cram a lot of content in. 

The crafting is really where the game shines. You can craft anything from primitive spears to sticky bombs. Bone Armor to stealth armor, clubs, axes, herbal medicines, tools. The crafting is exceptionally deep. I’m about 40 hours in and there’s still things I’ve yet to craft I’m sure. 

It’s also worth stating that the AI is good. Very good. My first ever experience with a cannibal saw us in a standoff. She was just watching me, I went up to her and immediately noticed something was wrong with her. I took out my axe and I lunges toward here. She ran away and came back with friends. They circled me for a while before I took a swig at the leader and they ran off scared again. It’s the first time a game has ever made me feel like the AI was reacting to my character. Even if they really weren’t. The AI will get more full as you progress through the game but the initial encounters made for some great gameplay moments.

Survival-8/10
This IS a survival game. You’ll battle the elements, hunger and thirst and your own sanity. Pretty standard for survival games but The Forest does it in a way where it feels fun. Rates are balanced, and creating your own sustenance is both easy and challenging. I don’t think there ever was a time where I felt like the survival aspect was crushing my experience.  You’ll scavenge for supplies from the plane but those will eventually run out. Its at that point where you’ll have to start crafting your own medicines and hunting for your own food and water.

Sound-10/10
Once again this lends itself to the atmosphere. Cannibals sound scary, nature sounds beautiful, and events have their own ominous music to accompany them.

Story-9/10
Everything seems pretty straight forward untill you get towards the end of the game. I won’t spoil it but the story was fantastic. 

The Forest-9/10
Between Co-Op and peaceful modes you’ll never run out of things to do. The Forest combines a spectacular atmosphere with engaging gameplay to provide one of the best survival experiences you can ever have.

It was about the fifth day on the island. I had build a simple shelter, had a decent supply of food and had crafted a simple spear. I decided it was time for some exploring, and I ventured downhill to try and find out where I had landed anyways. Soon I came to a beach, a bio I hadn't explored before. And what do you know, as soon as I arrive three sea turtles turn up in my sight. I got super excited, because I was running out of fresh water to drink. In my survival book I'd seen I could build a raincatcher from a turtle shell, and I desperately needed one. Even before the majestic creatures had fully come to land I jump ontop of one and use my axe to brutally decapitate it in one swing. As I tear open its shell with my bare hands I gather what flesh I can to eat later, and without a second thought I murder the others as well. I'd been living on squirrel for days, so this was a real treat. I noticed I could carry only one shield at the time, so I grabbed the nearest one and ran back to my base to set up my first raincatcher. As I came back to the beach to collect the other shields I suddenly notice two of the canibals standing over the corpses of the turtles I just killed. [b]MY TURTLES![/b] I grab my spear, and run down the beach yelling. As the woman looks up and is suprised by our first contact I launch my spear in her chest before she can even react. With my axe I bash her fase in, sending her teeth flying through the air. As she drops dead I take my spear and covered in her blood I turn to the other guy simply staring him down. It takes a couple of seconds but then decides to turn around and run away yelling. Good, I think to myself. Let him tell the others nobody touches my turtles.

10/10 would turn primal again. 


When I fist saw the video's I though the game was some kind of base building with waves of enemies coming at you stronger and stronger. I was pleasantly suprised that there's so much more depth to it than that. The game allows you to set up camp anywhere you want, multiple even, if it helps. You can stay away from the canibals, stalking them and learning their patterns. The game rewards you for memorizing which plants grow where, where which animals tend to live and which routes the canibals take. It's a survival where you need to upkeep your food and water supply from the wild, build shelters to stay dry and warm, and find the right ingredients to build your tools. Though they will be attracted by your campfire, the canibals on the surface are actually not your biggest problem. The true horror of the game sets in when you feel prepared enough to go explore the network of caves underground. So dark, so quiet, and so many corpses. The game never tells you what to do, it's completely up to you what you want to explore or try out. If you think the game gets boring all you have to do is venture further from your place of comfort and there's all kinds of places and items to find. Fighting the canibals is tough at first, but it gets kinda satisfying as you get stronger and are able to take on 3 or 4 of them at the time, gather their dead bodyparts and put them on a spike to warn the others. They have an interesting mechanic where you can actually scare them off, and they become noticably more cautious. 

Things feel rewarding. You have a proper spear, have learned to hunt the wild, recognize plants and herbs. You have explored the lands and carry half a week worth of dried meat under your self made hide clothes. Just use that pot to collect some water and [i]Oh Sh!t is That a Crocodile?[/i]
WOW!!!

Got out of the plane and ran away as quickly as I could(first time I played they attacked the plane like 3 minutes in the game) So I figured they were attracted by the crash. 

Found a quiet place, I built a shelter and made a fire. Cooked a rabbit, but it started raining so I couldn't keep the fire up, so I found some berries and luckely, they were not poisenous. 

Went to sleep woke up early morning and there was 3 naked guys stalking me outside, they attacked me and I ended up slaying all of them. I built one statue with their heads and legs.

Later in the morning, 3 other naked guys came near my shelter, I burned the statue and they ran away. They came back 5 minutes later with 3 more. I couldn't handle their attacks, so they kidnapped me. I woke up in a dark cave with only a lighter to show me the way. I heared a distant shouting that scared the living crap out of me and I saw about 30 passengers hanged upside down above me.

I tried to find my way out of the cave, I almost couldn't see anything and I could hear them, I know they were watching me. Then after a lot of stress and sweating, I found the exit. I was so glad to finally see the sun, then some extremelly weird texture rendering just started spawning trees, flowers and life in front of me. 

Then went on a run trying to find my shelter but I was very low health. Got cold. I got jumped on by a naked girl who were on top of a tree. She took me by surprise, I shouted in real life, I saw my cat running out of the room scared of me.

Finally, I take a close look at the naked girl just before she gives me the final blow, the last comment I have before to die: '' Hey!!! I can see her tities''.

I survived 2 days.

This game has a lot of bugs, they still have a ton of work to do on this game. But if you are not the kind of person that expect a finished game when you play an early release, you know this game is going to be great. Keep supporting it, make your friends play it and this could be without a doubt the best survival game ever.
Yea. so i tried to play this in VR and nearly shit myself when a naked lady was running in circles around me in the middle of the night.
But overall experience was 10/10
Would definitely recommend this game to anyone that is looking for a good survival/horror game that you can play with friends, VR and even Non-VR
With over 800hrs of gameplay with The Forest, having played before the island's were really opened up, the mountain area accessable, and before there was a giant hole, I must say this game has come a long way. What I find best about the gam is that the developers are always working on it, even in smaller ways. I have seen many interesting early release games get abandoned by the devs in charge of it, The Forest is not one of them. It has a steep learning curve but that is part of the fun. This game is still in development and has a way to go til it is "complete", but I have high hopes for the crew as they continue developing the game.
You remember when teams of developers actually cared about their game, listened to feedback, recommondations, and bug reports? When microtransactions didn't litter a game? When DLC (if any) meant something? Remember those times? 
The Forest's developers do, and they are doing an damn fine job at their game. Take time to explore and actually try in this game, and you'll find tons of cryptic, radical stuff. Great job Endnight. 

11/10
Day 1:
I've crash landed on a strange island. Don't know how I survived, but I think I caught a glimpse of some strange tribal man before I lost consciousness. After I awoke I set to the business of building a shelter. Who knows how long it'll be till I'm rescued.

Day 2: The tribals seem unfriendly. They showed up at the edge of my camp and eyed me while growling. They have clubs made out of human skulls and seem to be wearing teeth around their necks. I'm going to set up traps tonight.

Day 3: Some random skinny tribal tried to eat me! He came into my camp giggling and laughing, I had to kill him with my axe! Its the first time I've killed anyone. I dumped his body outside of camp. I don't like to look at it.

Day 4: The more healthy tribals tried to siege my camp today. Attacked me uprovoked but a few of my traps caught them. I killed the last man with a more modern axe I scavenged from a camp. They'll not catch me unprepared again. I'm not dying on this bloody island.

Day 5: After seeing that they have some kind of displays made out of human remains, I decided to do the same. It was disguisting and unthinkable but maybe now they'll realize this place is dangerous and give me some peace. Got a little hunting done too.

Day 6: I've been forced to build a wall around the perimeter. The healthier, smarter tribals seem to be warded off by my effigy but the starving ones are desperate enough to risk attacking. I'm going to fortify this place. I'm not becoming somone's lunch.

Day 7: While checking my traps outside camp I was attacked by some kind of weird tribal leader with armor made out of human arms. He and his war party were no match for my defenses. I stuck their heads outside camp. Maybe now they'll learn what will happen should they come here again.

Day 10: I've been a little too busy to write in my journal recently. I decided to take the fight to them and burned one of their camps with molotovs. A week ago, their screams would have bothered me. Now I was just relieved. Maybe now I'll be able to sleep at night.

Day 11: A huge monster with a ton of legs busted in through my outer wall. Fortunately I'd stashed away some explosives, so that made quick work of it. On closer examination this thing seems to be made out of...people. Sewn or mutated together somehow. What is happening in this place!?

Day 15: I cut off the heads of every tribal leader and put them on sticks. The sticks litter the outside of my camps. They'll regret the day they attacked my camps. I'll kill every last one of them if I have to. Even those mutant monsters will die.

Day 20: I decided to start adding legs to the effigies. It seems to complete them a little more. Even the starving tribals are wary of attacking me now. They know that death has come among them.

Day 30: I'd been so busy fighting off these tribals I didn't get a chance to hunt for days at a time. Haven't had time to write in my journal either. I'd walked into one of their camps I'd ransacked and saw an arm stick cooking on a spit. I was so hungry I took a bite. It wasn't too bad actually. I'm trying not to think about it.

Day 45: I added arms and legs pointing in different directions to each of my effigies to spell out "YMCA". Nothing really else to do to pass my time here. When I was putting them up, I ate one of the legs. I was very hungry and none of my traps have been yielding any fruit, but these perfectly good limbs have been sitting here all this time...

Day 62: I'm starting to like it here...All the limbs I can eat. Good sunshine by the beach. This island isn't so bad.

10/10 would decend into madness again.

UPDATE: Day 184: I Currently have a stronghold of death. Rock walls the size of trees. Mountains of bodies connected to effigies. Traps inside every wall. I don't know where these animals are coming from but they seem to be endless. There has to be a source. I've killed more than I can possibly count. More than this island seems to be able to support, yet they keep coming.

I found a strange door exploring one of the caves. It has a keycard slot. Maybe I'll find my answers there.

Whatever is inside, I'll bet its limbs taste delicious.
First off this game gets addicting...building and surviving is not easy which makes the game very interesting. This is not a game for the easily scared person. Sounds and things are always happening around you. The A.I. in the game is very good. Here is an example of good game-play. 

I found myself chopping down wood in forest during day and spotting things moving in distance i decided to ignore it cause it wasn't to close...before you know it a cannibal was directly next to me i stood still hoping it would go away. (BAD IDEA) the freaking thing jumped at me at full speed (Scared the crap outta me) I chose to defend myself and was knocked out by him. woke up to two men dragging me across forest...then woke up in a dark cave next to a rope where i quickly climbed up and found myself running for my base camp at full speed i noticed there where lots of cannibal's quickly running aside me and in distance i did not stop.. i finally made it to base camp and decided to seek revenge. I heard screams near camp on beach so i healed up and made some fire bombs and got my axe. I found 4 of them on Beach burned 2 of them and beat the crap outta the other 2 with my axe. chopped off all their body parts brought it back to camp and stacked their limbs to sticks show my victory! 


10/10 cant wait for game to fully be finished.
I was waiting to write this as I dislike leaving reviews on unfished games, however I feel I should review this one slightly.

In a mass of survival open world crafting games it's hard to stand out.  The Forest barely does this, however there is just something about it that keeps me coming back.  Don't get me wrong here, it doesn't stand too far from most of those games, but in the key areas it does stand out on, are the area that are simply the most important.

The key point as to why I am recommending this ---> CONSTANT updates with content and bug fixes.  This is huge for an Early Access game.  It went from being a nifty OKish single player adventure game, to an amzing co-op survival open world game in a mere 6 month span.  Content constantly get's added, AI re-worked(which is interestingly impressive as is), new crafting recipes, parts of the Island reworked are all updates that come out in regular intervals.

I won't go into the game details other than that the game is actually very fun to play.  I highly recommend this title, even if you are skirmish about Early Access titles, this one is in a good, fun, playable state to try out and feel as  if you have had a full gaming experience.

I would also like to add, make sure you pick up two copies because multiplayer is a must!

Journal Entry 1 

After crash landing I have gathered all resources at the plane, walked a short distance from the crash and found a nice hill to build fire and setup camp. 

Journal Entry 2 

I went down to the beach and started fishing, found lots of beer bottles in the sand, I even found a tent pitched on the beach... where is everyone?? 

Journal Entry 3 

While setting up camp I saw a group of 3 tribesmen doing a beach patrol in the area where I was fishing, I didn't engage only observed them. Its getting dark now and I know now that im not alone. I'm not sure of these tribesmen's intentions but Its starting to rain and I need to build a shelter. I'm going to the woods to collect some logs.

Journal Entry 4 

While heading back with a fresh cut log I noticed multiple lit torches heading towards my camp, about 12 of them from what I counted, Indeed it appears there are many more tribesmen than I originally thought. They appear to be scanning my camp looking for survivors.

Journal Entry 5 

After observing the tribesmen for 10 or so mins I approached one of the females of the pack, she stared at me in shock for about 30 seconds then screamed and ran away. She did not attack... perhaps they are a friendly people after all! 

Journal Entry 6 

I should have just left them alone, apparently the female ran back to get the rest of the tribe.... I was attacked and chased, I was able to kill three of them before accidentally backing up off a cliff and falling to (what I thought was my death). 

Journal Entry 7 

I have awoken in a cave of hanging bodies, I am badly injured from my cliff fall and only have my terribly lit Bic lighter to guide my way through the cave.... this may be my last journal entry as I am starving and going to die soon.... Thank you... Endnight games.
My experience playing the Forest
Day 1: Okay, I survived a plane crash. Time to survive, find my son, and get out of this forest.
Day 2: WTF I'm being attacked by naked people
Day 3: I don't think I can live much longer
Day 5: Shit I die... wait I'm not dead?
Day 7: Wait so I can burn bodies and make armor out of their bones?
Day 13: *Finds chainsaw
I AM A GOD
Day 15: I should make a cabin
Day 22: Done with the cabin
Day 29: *Runs into a creepy mutant for the first time
WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCKING HELL IS THAT!?
Day 34: I should defend my home with walls from those creatures. (Insert Trump joke here)
Day 42: Done. 
Day 44:I should go down the giant pit with this turtle shell 
*Does it and spends a real life fucking day trying to find a way out
Day 56: I should make a useless gazebo
Day 60: Done! *Gets 'You should be looking for Timmy' achievement
Who? Oh, the son? I completely forgot about him. Is he still alive? That's it I'll go look for him soon


And I have not found him til this day

10/10 would lose son again
My plane crashed, my son got taken by what seemed like cannibal mutants so I did what any real father would do and vowed to get revenge.
I found myself an axe.
I raided the wreckage for bottles of booze.
I raided the suitcases for scraps of cloth.
I made a stack of molotov cocktails and set out to eradicate the tribe that stole my progeny.
I found a very scenic looking spot on the beach and decided to stay the night.
The sunrise was especially pretty so I built a treehouse and decided to stay another night.
Now I am tending to herb gardens, breeding rabbits, preserving lizard meats and listening to scavenged cassette tapes.
Every now again wandering mutants come too close to my turf, so I burn them with molotov cocktails and use their body parts to create ghastly effigies on my beach.
I also use tree sap to glue their teeth to my axe. 52 mutant teeth glued to my axe means it 1 shots cannibals.
I should probably venture out and find out what happened to my firstborn, but the sunrise on this beach is just so pretty, plus I need to finish building this gazebo.
Don't read guides, don't watch videos. Find a friend or two willing to spend 16 bucks and take a risk, you'll be happy you did. The games atmosphere hits home like nothing i've played in a long time.
This game needs no words... Now I shall proceed by typing words about the game.

It is most definatly worth it! If you love survival, get it!
Best open world, survival, sandbox, horror game EVER!!! (in my opinion)

Great Atmosphere
Great Mechanics
Great Graphics
Great Game

One of my most loved games of all time.
9.5/10

At first I wasn't expecting too much of this game. 

[u] HOWEVER [/u]
When I began to play I was pleasantly surprised!
The graphics are stunning, and the game is optimized well, the NPCS were interesting and responded to your actions, the atmosphere is chilling yet oddly beautiful....

[u] The crafting system...now THAT'S something. [/u]
I don't think I have ever seen a game with set inventory space for every item. It's so satisfying being able to carry a set amount of everything, and not just a lot of one thing- I found that this balanced the game nicely too, and helped maintain the survival aspect even when you went to complete the storyline. 

I spent the first 20 hours surviving before I even realised there was a story, but when I did...Oh boy...
Not only does this game exist as a wonderful survival game, it has an unexpected and exhilarating storyline.


I commend the creators for their beautiful creation, and  can't wait to see what the future holds for "The Forest".
This game has it's issues, but once they are fixed, this game will be amazing.

Quick story: You play as this guy on a plane with a child (maybe yours?) holding onto your arm. Plane crashes, some naked tribal guy takes said child, and you're on your own.

Every time you start a new game the plane will be somewhere else so you wont know where you are every time. You start off with the basics, candy, beer, a fire axe, a heart monitor (that you'll never use) and food. You'll have a survival handbook that is very useful, itll tell you what to do as well as give you a way to build things like a fire or a place to sleep, even walls to keep you safe. 

When you hop off the plane (and taking the fire axe out of Stacy's face) you will either be greeted with sunshine or greeted by 3 naked people about to destroy you together.

At this point, if you're lucky, no one will bother you. If you're unlucky however, and the naked tibal people see you and run after you, good luck defending yourself with a fire axe and some snacks (oh and pills). 

I love the visuals of this game, it's very beautiful. The sunshine, the darkness, all close to realistic. I love the level of darkness at night, it's just enough to hinder vision, but not enough to be annoying. The weather is pretty awesome too, the only problem I have with the weather is the rain, I got tired of this routine:
1. You are cold and wet
2. Get warm by fire
3. Rain stops, ventures out of base/camp
4. Rains again 15 seconds later making you run back to camp/base just to get warm
5. See step one

On to the enemies: I hate them. They are annoying, buggy, and overpowered at times. I would be in my camp that is surrounded by big tall walls, and suddenly *INCEPTION MUSIC BWUM*. I would look around and see no one, then suddenly a bunch of them run through the walls and runs right back out. This gets annoying, especially when they warp into your camp and hit you from below your log cabin. When you finally have the balls/girl balls to venture out of your camp/base, you see a single naked woman watching you, then walking up to you, then hits you once taking over half your health (perfect time to look at that heart monitor!!). You swing your axe at them but your attacks are SO slow that she hits you 2 times before your next swing. 

Other than the things I mentioned, I love the IDEA of the enemies, they watch you, study you, instead of attacking sometimes. I love the idea of stealthing around these naked people or being stalked by them. I know it sounds weird, but these elements are not implimented well in other games, I would love this open-world survival horror game to have a moment where you hear a sound and if you're lucky, you'll see one running away.

The food: You have only a few choices on food that I've encountered: Candy bar, fish, rabbits, and plants. I hated that more often than not I'm being forced to stop everything just to eat a bunny. I have trouble getting the fish, they swim too far from where you can stand and fish from, meaning you have to stand and hope they swim close to you and not swim out into the ocean. Don't get me started on the sharks in the ocean, they spawn a safe distance, SOMETIMES, once they spawned right at the edge of the water, you can't go in without being eaten. Honestly the hunting, other than the tech issues, is amazing compaired to other games. To fish (at the moment you must find a sharp spear, can't make it yet) you get a sharp spear and go look for the ocean or a pond. You stand over the fish and stab them, making them stick to your pole. This is amazing, it's small but it's great that you don't just go up to a fish and press "take". To hunt (there are only rabbits to hunt and eat at the moment) you either grab your fire axe and start running after them and swinging away, or you make a rabbit trap. 

The building: I love the fact that you can make yourself a camp and stay safe. When you look at your survival guide, you can build walls, cabins, steps, a tree house, and other things. They keep you safe from those naked people that want to sacrifice your body to the "Bieber" they keep seeing in the magazines on planes. I love that if you build a fire, they will come and try to kill you. If I were a tribal naked person and this guy that was in a plane crash made a camp out of 50 logs that are bigger than him in less than 2 days all by himself, I would avoid him completely.

The game is in development, so there are some bugs that I've run into, here is a list of a few:
-Gets killed by a naked Leelo and I wake up in a cave surrounded by 3 more naked girls and gets pummeled by them almost instantly. This isn't normal, you have a bit more time than that to recover.
-End of the level, missing textures, trees in water, a message that says you can't go this way yet, it's not available in this version of the game". When that happened, I was staving looking for fish in water, and never saw one for miles.
-Made a big base with large walls and stuff to keep safe, but a bunch of enemies run straight through it and attack me.
-I suddenly start swimming while I was cutting down a tree, I am able to slowly swim off into the sunset above the ground and over the trees. Felt great but it was a game-breaking bug, I can't save and come back, the glitch will still be there.
-I walk into a cave, start slowly rising upward, looks like I'm swimming then suddenly dropped from a high place and dies.

All in all, I loved this game, it needs a lot of work but if they continue to build it even after the alpha is released, it would turn out to be a outstanding game. I recommend this game because it has potential to be a epic game, if they put love and care into it.

Suggestions (keep in mind these are probly added by the time anyone reads this):
-I want to make a strong spear, adding a utility knife would make things a lot easier, you can cut the sticks to make a spear
-More things to hunt. This is more than likely added very soon.
-Don't make caves seperate than the main world. Every time you go into a cave, the world outside isn't there anymore, causing issues with framerate and crashes.
-A story. Surviving is it's own reward, but where did that kid go? Did they mistake him for their idol "Bieber"?
-Random events: Imagine this, you are walking in the forest, you hear a sound, you look around but see nothing, then when you turn to look in front of you there's a guy and he grabs your neck or tries to stab you, QTE moment. Or imagine this, you made a base, heavily fortified with big walls. One night you are eating your rabbit with a side of Butterfingers when suddenly you hear some chanting. You look over your wall and see a bunch of naked people with a very large log making their way to your wall, threatening to knock it down. Events like this make the game a LOT more fun and random.

I hope you enjoyed my review, thanks for reading! <3

The Forest is an open world adventure/survival-horror game that is set on an island. In the beginning of the game your in a plane with your son Timmy. Then plane crashes to the island killing almost everyone in it. You somehow survive the crash and when you wake up you see some man taking your son with him.

Your primary mission in this game is to find and save Timmy and somehow survive on the island by collecting resources and crafting tools, buildings and weapons. To survive you have to find food, clean water and build a shelter. Also you have to prevent dying from cold, sharks and all kinds of creatures that want to kill you.

There are many kinds of creatures in The Forest. There are normal enemies like cannibals that live in their own villages. They guard the island area and will attack you when in eye contact. Also there are "pale" enemies that are like cannibals but much stronger and faster. They can be found everywhere on the island and in caves while normal cannibals only spawn in their villages. From cannibals and pales you can collect bodyparts which can be used to cook food or decoration structures. After cannibals there are much more dangerous creatures living out there. There are creatures called mutants which can contain several body parts more than a normal human. There are mutants called "cowman", "virginia", "armsy" and "babies". By killing mutants you won't get anything so I would recommend to stay away from those if you are new in the game. Mutants can be found in caves and other places where is some valuable loot to found. They are like guards for the loot. As you play further the game, mutants will also spawn outside the caves. Also as you survive more nights, cannibals and mutants will get more difficult to kill and more aggressive. They'll also start breaking your shelter/buildings. The best way to protect your buildings and yourself from enemies is to run away and hide. If you like fighting you can also fight but make sure to have armor, good weapons, meds, bombs and flares when fighting stronger enemies.

In The Forest there are a ton of different weapons, armor, tools, buildings, defensive structures, plants, food and other items. Most common items like leaves, sticks, berries and plants can be collected from forests or shores. Rarer things like dynamite, booze and flares can be found in caves and in some special camping sites/cannibal villages. The rarest items like axes, chainsaw, flashlight and katana can be found only in some special places deep in caves. They are most likely to be guarded by several mutants or pale enemies so be careful!

The most important thing to stay alive is to prevent starving so you have to find food (can be found in caves, you can hunt animals for food, farm food..) and something to drink (water can be collected from springs and rivers, booze and soda can be found in caves and villages). Also you have to build a shelter and a fire to stay warm and energic.

The Forest ratings:

Gameplay: 9/10, Very confortable and easy to learn. Crafting, finding resources, fighting enemies, preventing starvation and cold, exploring the island and caves. Contains some bugs which could affect gameplay a little.

Graphics: 8,5/10, Realistic and beautiful graphics. Some items and areas are very detailed. Many common bugs which don't much affect playing. There could pop up some signs of lazyness of developers because almost all foods have same details when eating.

Soundtrack: 8/10, Some sounds are realistic some are just ridiculous. Listening to footsteps and shouting coming all around you in the caves and in the middle of a dark forest is just awesome and creepy feeling.

Story: 7/10, Pretty weird, deep and funny story to play. Won't spoil it, you have to play it yourself. Story stops like to the wall in the ending of the game but I believe they are adding more story in future updates or in full release of the game.

Singleplayer: Yes
Multiplayer: Yes, I recommend playing through game in co-op, believe me it gets very funny.
Mod support: Yes, you could test some community made mods with console ( your game could end up crashing or your world could get glitches)
Required computer: Medium if you want to play with decent graphics, High if you want to play with awesome graphic and art effects.

Is this game worth buying?
-Yes. Absolutely. I bought this game for 15€ but its 10€ on sale. Not a big difference tho. Its definitely worth its low price for a adventure/open world/first person game. I appreciate that creators of this game could make price tag such low. They put si much effort into this game.

Is this a good game?
-Yes. If you like survival/adventure/open world games with some horror elements, this is for you. Co-op makes this at least twice as fun. Surviving in a mutant forest with a friend. Can you imagine anything more fun? Althought if you are buying this game for its horror, I would recommend to not buy it. I found jumpscares and hearing and seeing enemies come all around me pretty scary but for hardcore horror fans this is nothing. Overall a good game 8,5/10 :)
Everything I do in The Forest feels like a big deal, so when things get crazy (and they really do) it is pretty mind blowing. I think that the mix of realistic, survival game mechanics and fantasy horror work great together. The Forest pushes you beyond the point of most other games. Which results in an extremely immersive and exhilarating experience. 

There are points in The Forest where the realistic and more fantastic elements come together beautifully. The developers of The Forest are not messing around, they will surprise you. There are some genuinely talented people working on this game.

I have no problems with performance running it at 1080p and 60FPS. This game is beautiful and there is an extensive graphics options menu. The sound design is impressive too and I would recommend that you experience it in 5.1 surround. 

In addition to the single player experience there is also a co-op mode. I didn’t play this part of the game much but I did try it. Everything worked fine when logging into a game and there seem to be a fair few people online. 

The developers of The Forest have become known as a dedicated and reliable team. They have done some fantastic work here and continued to add regular improvements. The game is still just an early access title but it’s one of the best games that I’ve ever played. 

I would highly recommend that you buy and play this game. Let’s give the developers loads of money, so that they can continue producing amazing content.
>start with a friend

10/10 would go on massive killing spree again
Paranoid Lumberjack Simulator 2015:

That being said, I only really recommend this game to be played in co-op. The game gets rather bland for me in single-player mode, and it's all shits and giggles until you or your friend gets their ass whooped by some naked guy with a club.

I also don't recommend this game for the easily frustrated. When you die, you lose most of your items, and all of that hard work you did gathering and crafting materials are flushed down the drain (like your dreams). And please, don't come in expecting your character to have the strength and endurance of Batman. Because he'll die. Very many times. And his hunger (and hydration) bar depletes faster than that of a Sim.

It's not your average hack-and-slash-everything-to-survive game, either. The Forest has implemented impressive and dynamic AI. The cannibals (the primary antagonists) have emotions, morals, religions, etc., and they come from different families and tribes. How one tribe of cannibals react to you will vary from another tribe; some will avoid you out of fear, some will come after you out of anger (for killing members). They change their patterns to accommodate you, and they utilize different strategies and members of their tribe to take you down. It all depends on how you choose to interact with the environment and the AI you encounter.

If you're looking for a decent, somewhat stressful survival game without the massive multiplayer feel of Day-Z and Rust, The Forest is for you. The game manages to keep you on your toes without it ever feeling too safe or too easy.

Arrive in the forest. Thrive in the forest. Survive the forest.

9/10
Fun game to play with friends. Glad they added a timer to see when the next update is. Devs havent left this game even though its been out for 3 years which is nice.

9/10
The Forest is a perfect example of what Early Access should look like (and especially pleasing for a Unity game), often updated in a manner that consistently adds more content to the game alongside numerous bug fixes, excellent execution of updates by their deadlines for as long as the mind can remember. Even in its currently unfinished (as of posting) form, this game has everything necessary to be a full game, but it wont be dropped there. Plenty of exploration, plenty of crafting and collecting, building, and so much more.

Honestly a 10/10 from me, I'll see to adding detail to this review at a later time.

I'll start out by saying I am a fan of survival and open world games. They're usually easy for me to figure out and master within a couple hours, and in a week or two I get bored with them from lack of challenges.

This game is not like that.

The Forest is unique in the sense that just when you think you've got things figured out, you are faced with a new challenge. Tasks as small as food and water can be challenging when you first start, and the cannibals are incredible. They're terrifying, sneaky, and horrifically human. They don't feel like NPCs, they feel like a person is controlling them. They can be cautious, fearless, docile, aggressive, curious, confused, and indifferent towards you. 

Nights in The Forest are flat out petrifying. If I was in this forest in real life I would have a heart attack in the first 12 hours.

If you're even considering buying this game, it's worth it. It will challenge you, it will have you jumping in your seat, laughing, swearing, and perspiring. At the very least it'll keep you occupied when you get bored of playing fortnut all day.
The Forest is easily one of the greatest games I have ever played, and for a very good reason. I will admit, the game in its current state isn't necessarily packed with things to do, but the amazing aspect of this game is the atmosphere. It is absolutely breathtaking how immersive a game can be when it lays out the environment and characters correctly. Night time and caves in this game are downright horrifying. The cannibals and mutants are already some of the most gruesome, terrifying antagonists I have seen in a game, and it gets much worse when your source of light is a lighter and you are anticipating ravenous freaks jumping out at you from the dark. Even the aspects of the game that don't make you shit your pants are great, I find it very fun and sometimes relaxing just walking around hunting and building. The survival aspect of this game is great. Exploration in this game is as rewarding as it is fun, in fact you need to go to some of the caves around the map to beat the game. If you decide to play this game, I STRONGLY recommend finding all of the crucial tools to beating the game for yourself. It is so fun and feels great building up everything you need to get to the end, which is also amazing and blew my mind. I don't believe I have played a game before that manages to be an actually scary horror game, a relaxing survival game, and a game that strongly entices you to explore everything. At the time I am writing this, the game is on sale. Off sale I would still HIGHLY recommend this game, but for 13 dollars? That is a STEAL. Easily recommended, and great job to the folks at Endnight!
[h1][b]"Basically Don't Starve/Rust if it was Rated 18+ Explicit, had stunningly beautiful, realistic visuals and sp00py as FUCK.  No joke, this game is genuinely terrifying; especially on your first playthrough in Singleplayer."[/b][/h1]

  You can turn off the enemies in the game by typing ' [spoiler][i]veganmode[/i][/spoiler] ' upon entering the main menu and turn them back on by typing ' [spoiler][i]meatmode[/i][/spoiler] '. 

I love survival games and this is probably currently one of the best games of its kind ever made (no exaggeration) - and it's still in development.  

Of course there are glitches and bugs here and there (like most open-world sandbox games commonly do), but it doesn't take away the fact that this is such a great, in-depth and intricate game in terms of [b]crafting and exploring,[/b] yet simple/straightforward enough that you don't feel overwhelmed and turned off by overly-complicated recipes.

You can make your own base [i](fully customizable)[/i], go swimming in the ocean, make a treehouse, hunt animals and acquire pretty neat weapons and special equipment (via super secret locations!) to help aid you and survive the unforgiving climate, [b]ALL WHILE TRYING TO FEND OFF THE BLOODTHIRSTY LOCALS WANTING YOUR HEAD AND SKIN ON A STICK.[/b]  [i]Note; all of this gets better and way more funnier with people you know (called friends).[/i]

[h1]Graphics: 8.5/10[/h1] 
[*] Fantastically creepy textures and shadow effects, the overall look of the environment will constantly keep you paranoid, whether it be night or day... majestic sunsets and eerie midnight skies are a pleasure to gaze at.

 [h1]Audio: 8.5/10[/h1]
[*] The sounds in this game is definitely what makes it truly breath-holding and unsettling.  You can hear the cannibals breathing and snickering outside your base, stalking your every move.  The howling wind will send a chill down your spine, the dripping noise of water in caves are unnerving...

 [h1]Gameplay/Mechanics: 8/10[/h1]
[*] Overall, this game plays out just like [i]any other Survival genre type game[/i] out there; some animations may seem clunky at times, but it is to be expected.  The enemies move very erratically and glitchy, whether that is on purpose or not is what makes them so damn creepy.

[*] [b]Crafting[/b] guide is laid out in a book, where you can look up different things by pressing 'B', but actually creating/upgrading items takes place in your inventory 'I' .  Overall very clear and easy-to-read, says which required materials you'll need.

[*] [b]Combat[/b] is fairly simple, you can block most of the enemies' attacks by holding right-click, with some boss mobs being an exception, obviously.  Ranged projectile-based weapons have poor physics though, and most are fairly inaccurate.


 [h1][i]A deserved 8.3/8.5/10 imo![/i][/h1]
My current favorite amidst the current pile of survival horror open world games.  Tons of potential, and playable with a ceiling right now in single player, but like most of this genre's early access titles, it depends where they go from here.  Seems like a great team is behind this though.

They just released multiplayer, which as you can imagine, requires a LOT of adjustment to code.  But you can easily see the potential here once its fully implemented.  

For those that are considering this for multiplayer as of Jan 7th 2015:
-Players that are not the game's host cannot save their progress (each time the game is launched they will lose all inventory/upgrades)
-As the host of my multiplayer instance, I can pull an unlimited amount of logs/sticks/rocks from holders after a save.
-loot is not shared (only you can loot what you see on the ground, you cannot give food/items to another player)

And some Pros that make this game standout from the rest of the genre:

Environment:  
The graphics and atmosphere are actually amazing.  The Forest is beautiful and alive during the day, and perfectly creepy and unsettling at night.

Balance:
While this is preference-based, I appreciated the balance balance between resource gathering, building, hunting, and combat.  The right mix leads to a sensation that you are not only surviving, but constantly building towards thriving.  Its setup perfectly for multiplayer assuming they work out shared items.  (We had 2 players chopping down trees, and 2 running log carts back to the base, and we felt all effecient about it!)

Potential:
My favorite review of this game is easily "Bad Parent Simulator 2014" (c: Barry Scott)  At the beginning of the game, you hazily watch your son being taken from you by a cannibal.  The story ends there at the moment.  All it would take is one good writer to add a rediculous amount of substance to the single-player, and possibly mutliplayer as well.  

In conclusion, this team has so much of the difficult aspects of the game complete.  From the graphics, mechanics, overall environment creation, and its easy to see that with just a little more love, at worst, this will be a must-own for the genre, at best, a trendsetter and genre-defining.

A.M.A.Z.I.N.G

Updated ALL THE FUCKING TIME!

These devs put so much work into this game it's unreal.

Update on the 4th of April, 2017:

This review still holds up. The game has made huge progress and is still fun and creepy as hell.

If you have a friend to play this with...just...just do.
I always find hard to review a game I adore. I fear not to give enough credit deserved and every word is carefully picked in order to show what the said game is about and why it should be purchased.

I will start off by telling why The Forest shines brighter than other survival games. I always found frustrating the neverending material farming in similar titles, days spent chopping, cutting, slashing just to build a very small hut that would get destroyed in a blink of an eye. The Forest is different. While it still takes time to craft something, you don't have to spend an entire day gathering resources. There are many available structures, with many functions (some structures having more than one fuction, as they can be extremely versatile).

Another typical feature of a survival game is the how-to-spend-the-night moment. I've always seen that moment as the one where you try to stay safe, where any lurking threat has to be avoided until you get a proper equipment to fight back (if you can fight back at all). In The Forest, with a proper strategy, you can drive away the cannibals (the main enemies) even from the first night. 

Hoping to have given proper credit to this game so far, I'll now start listing what I personally find extremely splendid about it:

[list]
[*] [b] Enemy AI: [/b] The cannibals are extremely intelligent, and their behaviour constantly develops following your gameplay; if you try to avoid them, they will look at you with curiosity, studying your movements without harming you. If you show an aggressive behaviour they will strike with an increasing force, calling for help and attacking your base weakest spots. If you are merciless they may end up fearing you, whereas if you spare some of them, they will respect you, seeing you as a godlike figure.
They have multiple strategies as well: they send scouts to check your base and equipment, plan surprise attacks in the day, build different totems around to inform the others (there are lots of totems, each of them with a different purpose) or to summon special enemies (mutants).
[*] [b] Co-Op mode: [/b] This is the real way to play The Forest in my opinion. Grab your friends and start playing together; the voice option (you can communicate with your real voice through an in-game Walkie Talkie) adds up to the immersion, and your voice can actually lure cannibals as they can hear you too. You can also trade items, in case a friend is in need of a particular resource; you can organize turns and roles thanks to this. Building, fighting and surviving with your friends is an incredible experience in The Forest, it's extremely fun and addictive!
[*] [b] The story: [/b] The storyline plays an important role in The Forest, and gives you an exciting purpose to venture the island to find your lost son. As you crawl into the caves, sail the sea or climb the mountains you will find details of what's going on, or what happened before your arrival. There's always something to find, from creepy to disturbingly fun discoveries.
[*] [b] Updates: [/b] I believe that this is the most updated Early Access game every played. There's always a new planned update that adds so many new features and fixes bugs (once you start the game there is a countdown to the next update), and it makes The Forest a title that you cannot stop playing as there will always be something new. A big kudos to the devs for this!
[*] [b] Optimization:[/b] Yes, the game is demanding in terms of minimal requirements, however I'd like to highlight the optimization aspect. I run this game on two PCs, a not-so-high-end laptop (which barely meets the minimum specs) and a potato desktop. I can perfectly run on medium settings on the former (without fps drops or stuttering, and on high settings with some small stutter in tense moments of fight), and low settings on the latter (without fps drops) and still looks amazing! You can run The Forest with the setting you like and it will still have a beautiful look.

The price of the game should be tempting as well. For that ridiculous sum you get an amazing survival game (I dare to say, the best so far) in constant development, with a dev team that actually listens to player's feedbacks and seems to be more excited than us to work on this project. 
It's an Early Access game but it already has more content that most of the "finished" titles.

Grab this game and I am sure you will NOT regret it!!
The Forest is currently an Early Access Survival Horror game. The core concept and execution of the game are excellent thus far. The Developers for this game are very active in the community and regularly release updates. Detailed breakdown:

What we know about the Story:

The story is in development. This means the whole Story is not there. You cannot "beat" the game as is. While exploring the island you will find clues as to what happened to "Timmy" (who is assumed to be your son). Parts of his toy, pictures, cave sketches. The game has basically zero handholding and refuses to point you in any direction at all. Most people will never find all the hidden story components. If you do find them, you will learn where "Timmy" has been taken

Gameplay: 

The game is played in First Person. The core aspects of the game are survival based. Hunger, Thirst, Rest, and Energy all make an appearance. You must hunt for food (or forage, alternatively), drink water, and sleep. So far, the survival aspects are pretty well balanced, and always being improved upon. 

You are going to establish a "base" or camp of sorts. Shelters, fires, walls, traps, gardens, resource management, and food storage all come into play here. There are quite a few creatable structures/devices already, and more are going to be added. Base creation takes time. You must gather resources to build things. Many people feel this is "grindy" but I enjoy it a lot. You will find yourself collecting rocks, sticks, logs from trees, leaves, and other objects and transporting them back to your base. This takes time, but seeing your base take shape feels extremely rewarding. 

Combat is a necessary part of the game. You are stuck on an island populated by cannibal tribes. Hungry cannibal tribes. There is so much to say for the AI in this game. They are already impressive and quirky and only getting better. The cannibals are currently broken into three tribes.

Starving/Skinnies.  These cannibals are very thin/lanky, often naked and covered in blood. They are almost always hostile to the player and have even been seen killing and eating fellow cannibals. Often acting as scouts, it is common to see solo skinnies roaming the island. When they find something of interest (deforestation, foreign structures, you) they will often hide and observe for a while. When satisfied, they will run back to their camp and alert fellow cannibals. If they located your base, expect to see patrols coming and going from now on. Skinnies are the weakest of all the cannibals, but they are EXTREMELY fast and agile. It is very easy for skinnies to dodge your attacks and get behind you when in combat. 

Cannibals. The regular cannibals look like normal humans, with a few skin tones, often covered in dirt or decorations. They usually travel in groups of 2-4. They are not always hostile to the player, but it's always safer to assume they are. If they know your location it's common to see them roaming around the edges of your base. they are slower than skinnies but they usually carry clubs and hit much harder. They are prone to splitting up in combat, flanking and coming from behind the player. 

Cave Cannibals. Gray skinned aliens, basically. Stronger than regular cannibals but a bit slower. use the same tactics and skills as above. 

The AI is so awesome. They stalk you, they observe you, leave effigies outside your base (body parts on sticks) to mess with you, ambush you, scare you. You will find yourself fearing them, looking over your shoulder when doing even the simplest things. there are special varieties of mutants deep in the caves, but I'll leave that for you to discover.

All in all this game is excellent. The core concept and foundation are very well done. The developers add more and more, and try to stay on top of glitches and bugs. More is being added and the game is only 14.99 on Steam. 10/10 for me, I love this game and would recommend it to anyone.



EDIT:

I have been playing this Multiplayer with a buddy of mine and it's amazing. This game is 10x better with a friend. We've had so much fun and I recommend anyone who enjoys it to try it with some friends. Beware though, the difficulty is increased for multiplayer. 11/10

EDIT 2:

I feel I need to take a moment to commend the Devs on this game. For a two man team (now 15-17 man team as the dev pointed out) they put an insane amount of work into this. There is an update timer on the main menu and anytime they go past the scheduled time, they always explain what happened and why. Every time they release an update there is always a hotfix for most of the new bugs the update causes within a day or two. This Dev team is literally a personification of what Early Access should be. They are such a great team and they really take the wishes of the community to heart. You will not regret the purchase, and these guys deserve support. Thank you to the Devs!
Day 42:

    I have established several camps around the island. Some are well fortified and if the natives choose to attack on a large scale these locations will surely be the choices for my retreat. I can't decide if they are all part of the same clan or if the "Shiny Ones" and the "Mutations" are seperate from the others. From what I have seen so far, this group is the only that dwell under ground through out the cave systems. To date, I have never seen the surface group enter the caves. I have witnessed on multiple occasions, openly violent attacks on the "Dwellers" from the "Surfacers" leading me to believe they are seperate. Of course this is only speculation. 

    Having the multiple camps has proven a must. This has allowed me to travel to the farthest reaches of the island in search for clues of my son's where abouts. I can only speculate on the accuracy of these findings as well as the location of my son. 

    From what I have seen thus far. I am holding out hope that he still lives. I have found pieces of his toy figure leading me to think he is leaving clues in hope that I still breathe and am in search of him. He is correct. I will tear down this island from shores to mountains until I have exhausted my options........ Or my life.

    I fear to speak of the other things I have seen.  Clearly, as an attempt to ward off either myself or the creatures, from their villages.These surfacers are readily willing to set up effigies of mangled, mutilated, severed body parts of the copses from the crash. I can only hope that for their part, the victims were deceased prior to these savages locating them. From what I can tell, they have not, I'll say that again, They Have Not eaten any human flesh that I know of. However, as for the cave dwellers,......... well let me only say that I have a stronger constitution then I had thought. 

    It's going dark and I must prepare for the nightly hunting from both the surfacers and the dwellers. They seem to prefer the evening for killing. Make no mistake though, if you find this journal.... If I do not find my son and I am fallen, do not trust the day anymore than the night. They want blood.... for what ever reason. I can hear their calls off in the distance now and the sun has lost its' hold. I must prepare.
Pros
+ You can fight against naked canibals. 
+ You can throw tennisballs to each other.
+ Jumping enemy babys.
+ Noisy bat screams in caves.

Cons
- Framedrop when you enter caves.
- Can't sleep anymore.

Conclusion: 9/10
Alright I've taken it upon myself to read through the negative reviews, and a recent one that stood out to me was that people found the main story to be quick, claiming to finish the game in an hour. 

Well firstly I want to ask, did you read up online what you needed to do and what items you needed? If so then don't complain that it was too easy.

The developers have put across the objectives of the story in such a way that the character makes logical notes in their handbook, notes that everyday people would make, realistic. The game doesn't have bright flashing markers on where you should go, the map is great as it allows you to know where you haven't explored, but it doesn't tell you that you will find "Useful Item" here. 

I remember going all the way down the large pit, right down to a large door, only to realise I needed something to open the door, and such began my quest to find said item. But I remeber drowning to death, falling off rock faces and all experiences that told me I was mmissing something. 

Anyway, what I really wanted to say was that the story is not underwhelming, if you do it properly and not just read up online then it will keep you thinking and exploring for a decent amount of time, constantly having to go back to base to resupply on vital resources. 

For a game that's in alpha, the story still immerses you into this character that's just as lost as you are when you start the game, with the simple task of "Find Timmy". Excellent, realistic and emotional story that's worth doing.
This game just ticks all of the boxes for me.

Games like Outlast force you to experience all the jumpscares. This goes for most games that belong to the horror genre. The Forest, however, is different. You can go the whole game without encountering any of the mutants and cannibals if you play your cards right. It's only when you let your guard down that you get fucked over. Nothing makes you shit your pants quite like seeing the silhouette of a hunting party sprinting across a hill in the distance. I've woken up some mornings and really don't want to leave the safety of my tree house. No other game has given me that gut-wrenching feeling as to date. I feel as if i'm fucking playing Minecraft PvP all of again; holding down "sneak" for dear life and as not to get spotted. The AI in this game is fantastic. The cannibals will leave you alone for the first few days, watching your every move. As the game progresses they get more and more ballsy. The AI will test you to see how you respond. If you act fearful and run away they will see you as prey and you'll end up with more raiding parties visiting you. However, If you act aggresive then they will retreat only to return with an army that, no matter how powerful you are, you just wont be able to match. Staying neutral with the tribesmen requires maintaining eye contact, holding your ground and showing your strength. Gaining respect from the natives is crucial to your survival. I do have to poke some fun at the audio though. Whilst the atmospheric sounds are fucking on point, certain noises are just all over the fucking place. For example, when fighting a single cannibal it can sound like there are 3 more behind you when in reality there's not. Beating a native to a pulp is incredibly disorientating when screams from the same cannibal move from your left ear to your right ear even though the tribesman hasn't moved. Certain water sounds are also unbearably loud when compared to other ambient effects. Obviously the game is still in alpha and these issues will surely be resolved, but the game already feels incredibly polished already; I've yet to experience any sort of game-breaking bug.

I've not played a game that made me giddy inside for quite a while. Therefor I highly reccomend "The Forest"
They came in the night, a man and a woman, screaming outside of my walls. Won't let me sleep. I light an effigy to throw them off and eat something. My walls are thick and they are weak. They keep screaming and banging on the wood. They won't let me sleep. I hear the man getting caught in one of my snare traps. I'll deal with it tomorrow. Woman still there, banging, screaming. Getting worse now. She's obviously distressed about the mans entrapment. Won't let me fucking sleep.

I head out. She's running in circles around him, sometimes stopping to stare at me and scream. She charges. I cut her down in front the hanging man. My katana is sharp and she is weak. As she lets out her dying breath, I bring my axe down and tear her apart, head first, legs last. The man shouts and swings at me with his club, panicking. I take the axe to him till he stops screaming. Exhausted from pain, he moans and mumbles. I slowly light a stick with a cloth on and set him on fire. My flame is hot and he is weak. 

10/10, would lose track of who's the real evil again.
So, i completed the game in 18 hours with friends.
The pluses of this game are: 
-An interesting story with the caves
-Multiplayer
-Nice building system
-atmosphere, its terrifying how you explore the caves on singleplayer.
but.. here are the things i dont like
-the fighting system
-multiplayer optimalization
and thats all basically.
the game ran on like 30 fps even though my computer sucks, so thats not really bad
thanks for taking your time to read my dumbass review, now goodbye.
This is not just another survival horror game. Dare I say one of the top 5 games I've had the pleasure of playing. There are so many different levels to this, Took me a bit to realize that. AND to have Co-op option ontop of that? Man. -There are minor bugs, as it's still in alpha. Nothing terrible that they're not ontop of fixing (scheduled updates). I highly reccomend this game to anyone who loves horror, survival, a mysterious story and a few wtf moments.
10/10

Got chased by a half-naked, screaming chick through the woods until her friend arrived and punched me down.
Later, I woke up in a cave like Luke Skywalker in Empire strikes back.
Yet there was no laser sword but those dumb cannibals placed my pickaxe underneath me so I was able to cut me free.

Unfortunately I went deeper into the cave instead of out of it and got eaten by them. oO

Right now at second try, I built a nice shelter nearby a lake (of which I can drink water). Bushes with good berries, deers, rabbits and lizards are nearby to get eaten.
And from time to time some cannibals run into my traps. ^^
Life is good in The Forest... I already forgot that my player char had a son with him that got kidnapped. XD

For early access it is working very good and absolutely entertaining.
This game should be the new standard set for survival games. The first day begins gathering basic supplies: food, water, sticks, rocks, and setting up a basic shelter. It might even seem peaceful at first. Lonely, but peaceful. Then the cannibals arrive. Its the middle of the night, you wonder why sleeping only lasted through half the night as a leader and others in the night patrol encircle your pitifully undefended camp. This is one of the few games that forces you to flee in that situation, leaving everything behind. But then a new day comes! You harvest lumber, you hunt, and you build to survive. But beware, as your impact on the forest becomes more obvious, the cannibals bully you more and more. 

Truly a spectacular single player experience, and once more bugs are fixed, the same could be said for online play. The only reason this game isnt a perfect 10/10 is some annoying bugs, but it really does feel like a finished product to me, so final rating: 9/10
The Forest
A game published and developed by Endnight Games Ltd.

I am no stranger to horror games in the slightest, having played Outlast, Resident Evils, Silent Hills..Nor am i stranger to the crafting, survival games out there like Ark and Conan. But stepping into The Forest for the first time, sent chills down my spine, and simultaneously made my jaw hit the floor. 
Given this experience has only really JUST begun for me, Sitting happily at about 13 hours at the current clock, I felt its my duty to all the gamers out there, to review this game and get as many people behind it as possible!

I usually break my reviews down into 4 categories, Gameplay, Graphics, Story and Music followed by an Overall section If you prefer shorter reviews, you can skip down the "Overall" header, I do this to provide as much possible ground work for you to create your own opinions from mine, or even better yet persuade or disuade you from the purchase. So with no further adieu, Please enjoy my review of...The Forest.

Story:
This is a difficult one for me to detail heavily on the story aspects because i haven't really discovered much of it yet, there appears to be quite alot of little details scattered around the islands many nooks and crannies that help reveal the story to the players as they ...patrol..(for lack of a better word that doesn't make me sound like a complete coward) the island, looking for their Kidnapped son (No spoiler warning required, it literally happens in the first 2 minutes).
I really love how it is all left to your own decisions really, there are pictures, drawings, dead passengers from your flight scattered vigorously across the island, and horrifically displayed, to really engulf you in the beauty and cruelty of this island and what has lead it to what it has become. As you again "patrol" the island you will discover pieces of the islands history, pieces of your own story and pieces of what has happened to your son. An extremely rewarding and effective way of story telling in a survival game. Excellent.

Gameplay:
Definitely the easiest part of this early stage review to write, the gameplay is near flawless, for a survival game it has done what very few survival games have, Let me play it alone, There is literally NO need for you to have other people playing it with you, Not that i have a problem with playing multiplayer, but absolutely requiring it to progress, or to stay alive is extremely daunting and near impossible in everyones busy schedules. This game DOES have a multiplayer mode, but i have found it to be less of an experience when other people are present, and it really deters from the overall mood the game tries to set out.
I vaguely remember crawling around hiding under beds and in lockers in Outlast trying to be free of the never ending parade of enemies that wanted to eat my spleen, This game has definitely enveloped that experience as a whole and turned it into its own mind afflicting horror, this is probably due to the almost unpredictable enemies that encroach but don't attack, or just watch you run across the beach from the top of the sheer cliff faces, planning and plotting your doom. You remember when you're a child and you hear noises coming from around your room in the pitch black of night, and you just sit there wishing it was day time. That is basically this game in a nutshell.
The crafting system and inventory system are intertwined in this game i have to admit, it is very satisfying how it is displayed for you, on a open blanket (i guess thats what it is) where you can visibly see everything you are carrying scattered across it where you can select items, combine them to upgrade or even to create entirely new items from the components, a little unrealistic, if not entirely unrealistic of how much 1 random person who isn't very fit can actually carry, but nonetheless, a very interesting concept i would LOVE to see in more games, it really helps make you feel like you're in a survival situation, the building crafting on the other hand is done through the "survival guide" which is another great idea, really giving you some kind of starting spot to build from, teaching you what to do first, where to go from there, as well as tracking all your notes and keeping a track of your personal statistics, like Strength and athleticism, and the more importantly your ever decaying sanity. (Both in and out of the game, lol).
This games enemy AI is extremely taxing on you as a player, continually unsure of what the enemy is planning, or what they are going to do in combat can really take its toll on you in the game, But i have personally found the combat to be fair despite the enemies significant advantage of being part Spiderman and the hitting power of the Incredible Hulk, The whole "demoralising" your enemy to ensure your safety concept is particularly interesting to me, where you create effigies from the ...body parts of your fallen enemies and display them as some sort of graphic portrayal of power and supremacy...Or just aggravate an entire tribe into your own death. I have to admit, maybe its a psychological issue of mine but carving up the enemy bodies is oddly satisfying, mainly because i've never been able to in a game and the concept is like the cavemen discovering fire.
Despite my admiration for this game, it has a rather large glaring flaw that i can see, the days are far too short in my opinion, I understand they wanted to scale the experience into rather "rapid" days so that the enemies can be seen formally becoming braver, and your progress is stifled slightly, but i would definitely enjoy more time in the day or lighttime to explore and even scavenge materials, even an extra 10-15 minutes as a whole would be absolutely perfect.

Graphics:
I attempted to run this game on all the settings to see the difference in graphical quality between Ultra Low and High, and there is a significant leap in graphical quality present in the drop/increase. I am currently playing it on High, with a rather stationary FPS of approximately 60 on a mid to high end PC. The game is really quite stunning as a whole though, with relatively short load screens despite the amount of deforesting and building i have completed so far.
The Forests......in The Forest are incredibly detailed and there are plenty of things to enjoy the sights of, when you aren't crying in the mud.

Music:
There isn't a huge variety of music in this game, from what i've gathered it seems to flicker in and out depending on the time of day, what you're doing and who is around you, I guess this is done for atmosphere, so you can hear the enemies around you, or even the russling of trees which i have to admit freaked me out on many occasions. I think the amount of music is perfect for this type of game, you don't want to feel like you're on an epic adventure, nor do you want to feel like you can crush the enemy forces easily. This is a dead set straight edge survival game, and limiting the music to hear your environment is extremely important to the experience.

Overall:
This game does so much really well and very little badly, perhaps the enemies are scaled rather badly, even on normal difficulty you can't really survive their onslaughts for very long, But even "deaths" in the game can end up being story based and help you discover more about the island and its inhabitants. This game has been an extremely rewarding experience so far, and i hope to keep updating this game, as it improves , and as i continue to play through it.
At my current standpoint, this game is a definite purchase, even as we stand now, i have probably encourage several of my friends to buy it, not to play together, but just to enjoy the experience that was developed here.
Don't hesitate and $20 USD this game is well worth your money and if you love survival games and horror, you will absolutely adore this game.
Alright, so, here's what happened. I got the Forest sometime last year via Humble Bundle, and it went on the shelf. I didn't look into the game AT ALL. This is important. 

A day or two ago I was going through my various unredeemed keys and redeeming them.  I noticed a game called "The Forest"  

"I remember that" I said to myself. "I think it was a chill exploration and crafting game"

IT WAS NOT.

I thought the game opening was a little dark, but I headed out from the starting area, and made my way to the coast.  I somehow didn't trip over any particularly odd sights on my way there.  I saw some odd stick structures off in the distance, and made a note to look at them at some point. Right now, I had a shelter to build!

As I wandered the nearby area, gathering sticks, killing turtles, and making my first steps towards comfort on this island, I saw something moving in the distance. "Oh, what is that? A monkey?" I wondered, as I approached slowly.  "Oh! A native. I wonder if I can speak to him, or trade?"  The native saw me, and made...a noise. Not a human noise, either. It charged. I FREAKED OUT, swinging my axe and cursing.  

 I thought to myself "Ok, this island has natives. Whatever, this guy went down easy, and I've got a metal axe. I've got the edge, and I'm only gonna get more ahead. Besides, how many of these things can there be?"

Things did not improve.

That, in a nutshell, is how The Forest feels. At first, a hint of something dark. Then, some peace. Hunting birds or dear for food. Then, just to remind you where you are, a sense of unease that mounts to frantic bursts of horror.  

This game is great.
[i]Back in 21 July, 2014 it was a good game. Now it's an even better game, with ending and finally full release.[/i] Excited for the future.

[b][i]Excellent[/i] 8/10.[/b]
The epitome of survival crafting openworld games IMO - absolutely reccomend.

Pros:
Stunning graphics
Imersive sound
Wicked in-depth story (if you pay attention)
Will actually scare your pants off
Awesome crafting capabilities
Realistic survival qualities
Smart AI
Little to no major bugs
Great for team play
That sweet 1GB download
Its cheap
The devs listen and update constantly

Cons:
Scary as fu$&
Very harsh for solo play
Resource gathering can be tiresome (especially solo)

I enjoyed this that much i'm afraid other games won't compare.

10/10.

I just purchased this game a few days ago.  While I haven't accrued too many hours yet, I will post a review of my experience so far. 

I've been very impressed so far with the building system in The Forest.  It reminds me of the system for base construction in Fallout 4 except implemented much better.  Placed structures usually mesh nicely with terrain and allow the user to place them almost anywhere, even on top of one another.  You can mesh walls into towers into supports and other structures well to make a continuous base without ugly gaps or places where objects fail to make good contact with uneven terrain.  I've had a lot of fun just building bases with friends.

The atmosphere of the game is also well done.  You start stranded on an uncharted island, awakening after a plane crash.  As you explore the island further, you find all kinds of creepy and tortured corpses of other would-be survivors of the plane wreck.  The island is also inhabited by the cannibals, which are similar in appearance to the Forsworn in Skyrim.  There is also ambiance such as wild animals and nice graphics which make the island feel alive.  Night time is very dark and you're often equipped with a lighter or a torch for visibility.  Construction of permanent lamps for your base that never burn out using skulls of slain cannibals lets you create a very homey feeling base against the darkness of the night.  It gives nice atmosphere and feels like you're stranded in a forbidding forest.  If you really hate the night, you can sleep through it, but I enjoy it.

The cannibals are a constant threat against survival and they seem to attack in larger and more powerful groups as you survive longer.  Some of them can even destroy some of your walls and structures.  I like this feature, as it feels like you're making a fort to hold against a siege rather than just purely for decoration.  Some of the more advanced enemy creatures are also really creepy looking and add to the atmosphere of The Forest and its mysterious island.  I have often wondered if these were the results of experimentation carried out on other survivors in some Frankensteinian lab or something below the surface.

There's also a lot of areas to explore.  You find interesting and unique things located around the island the game is centered on, and there are caves to explore too.  I haven't gotten very deep into these caves yet.  The game also, while giving a good and large map to explore with many interesting places, provides means for avoiding getting lost.  Player nametags are always visible from any distance.  Your base will show up from any distance with a marker.  Lastly, you can place flags and beacons to mark places of interest.  These features make the game navigable.

Control of the game is good.  It comes with a full set of keys to remap and adjusters for mouse sensitivity.  As a left-handed gamer, this was important to me.  There is also a wide array of graphics settings to change that get quite in-depth and customizable.  The game's sound is also good.  It has all the pieces in place to make a game enjoyable, and no major things are lacking in this regard.  It's also relatively bug free, especially given it's still early access.  

I would make one word of caution for this game, however.  It is a whole lot more fun with friends, and I'd recommend trying it out as a group instead of solo.  I feel that group play is immensely more fun than solo play.  I haven't tried to meet new friends on the game merely through its avenues, but it may prove difficult to network and create new friends in-game on your own as the options available are either solo play or co-op, which allows people to join the game if you invite them off your steam friends list.

I recommend this game if you like survival games or enjoy games where you can build bases.  Both these aspects of The Forest are done very well.
This game has been around for a while now, but since its launch, the developers (praise be upon them) have been working non-stop to make this the game they envision to be the best with the help of the opinion of the community. It has grown into a visual stunning crafting/survival game that is quite unique in its setting compared to other (and countless) early acces survival games. Especially since the announcement that the story ending is upon us, The Forest is nearly ready to become a finished game, and by its gameplay it feels like that too. It is still has some bugs and like I said the story ending is still worked upon, but with the regular updates (once a two weeks, normally) alot of those will be fixed in the next few weeks. I would definitely recommend this game to all that enjoy crafting and survival!
Considering that its Alpha stage, its brilliant.

The game itself at this stage, is well worth the money.

...There are many types of animal to prey on, kill, skin and eat/used to craft, so far ive seen lizards, deer, rabbits, fish, turtles, racoons, birds, and boar... of which, can be used to craft/cook.

...With headhphones on, the game is engaging and spooky, never knowing when you might be being spied upon or spotted by the enemy, the eery noise that alerts you when you've been seen or even if they.re suspicious.... ...some of them sound like 'Lord of The Rings' Smeegle on a bad day, ...sinister giggles... footsteps in the dark... O_____O

  ...Sometimes the mustants/cannibals will back off and run away, but sometimes there will be a group of them (and i believe they communicate between groups with distance between them, however it may just be me making it up in my head through in game paranoia)...they will chase you, try to knock you out...to take you to their pitch black, damp and spooky cave, corpses hanging from the ceilings...       -of which you have to (try to) escape,sometimes seemingly impossible-to-navigate cave sections, with only a lighter of which to find your way out with... which occasionally goes out, only to be re lit, to sometimes come face to face withyour captors... ...and they dont give second chances once they've caught you.

The lower than expected requirements needed to run it -(considering the amount of things going on/large array of plant and animal diversity and quantity -depending on your graphical option settings-as far as plantlife is concerned), i'd assume this is down to the ability of the developers/game engine... 


**CAUTION**

For your first few hours i'd caution you all that, until you are completely familiar with the workings of the game, you should have been to the toilet before you sit down to play, because-
(...and to note,  i'm not usually easily spooked)...
 -there is something about 'The Forest'- that makes it stand out from others within the same genre...The fluid/ slightly tactical movements made by the mutants,cannibals and animals, with their seemingly non standard boundaries of usual survival/openworld games, alongside the noises created by animals, yourself,the enemy or background noise, the fear of being found in the first few hours...

Looking forward to future updates and (minor) bugfixes, well done to the developers.
First impression of the game was terrifying. Me and my friend started a coop game and frantically scrambled for supplies before night time. We were too late. I ran out of energy so we built a bench for me to rest on, as I sat there regaining my stamina, we realized that we were no longer alone. 2 Tribal parties stumbled upon our camp just as night fell. Considering we were so close to their camp, they came to investigate. Terror and regret filled my bones. As the damp rain soaked our skin, we struggled agaisnt the horde. They overran us, and we died. 10/10 for amazing atmosphere/satisfying crafting.
Built a base near a cliff thinking that I could get away with harvesting less trees and still building a sturdy enough base. Lit a fire at night humming a merry little tune to my self when I hear a grunt. I run outside my base screaming and flailing my club I stole from the angry little chap who attacked me earlier in the day but to my suprise the area was empty. I go back to my fire thinking that maybe the meat I had eaten ealier was disagreeing with me. I start my humming again and I hear another grunt, convinced something is around me I start looking around and finally looked up. Perched in the cracks of the cliff was 4 goddamn cannibals just staring at me, we lock eyes for a moment and I procede to scream and run out to the ocean to drown myself. 10/10 would buy myself new underwear again.
[h1] I decided to put in a review for this game [/h1]

This game has been around for [b] 4 years [/b] , I remember when the game first released, there wasn't much to the game, not much of the map to explore, not much to build, not much to craft, so many damn bugs of course that you couldn't even save your game.

But I noticed from the many months and updates go by I certainly see that the developers are determined to improve the game to their ability which shows us that they want us to enjoy the game also by helping them improve the game and what should be added.

A couple years into the development of the game there has been so many improvements, the game looks a lot more realistic, more items to craft, new weapons, new enemies, better attacking approaching, defences and traps are improved, now you can customize your builds to exactly how you like even with friends you can do this.

The end game has recently been released before the full release and it answers so many questions on why your son was taken and why there are so many of those hideous looking mutated monsters, I don't want to get too much indepth so I won't spoil it for you so you'll just have to find it out yourself. :)

[b] Here are a few fun things you can do in the game [/b]

[list]
[*]Slide down hills with a turtle shell
[*]Build a long zip line
[*]Chop up the enemies limbs
[/list]

In conclusion, I do recommend this game to anyone who has great creativity, or just likes survival games in general, this game is a fantastic option for you and your friends.


[h1]Quick Summary[/h1]
Early Access Survival game with devs that actually care.

[b]Purchase Verdict: [/b] Yes

[h1]Points of Interest[/h1]
-Still buggy, but constantly being updated with new content and quick fixes.

-Beautiful enviroments

-Constantly evolving gameplay. There is still much to look forward to. The devs care, this is not one of the games that will be stuck in early access limbo.
Sure, I only have 9 hours thus far on record but I can tell you I'm absolutely loving it.

The thing that stands this out from other survival type games is the enemies and their AI.

Shortly after crashing in an unknown land you wake up and have to sort yourself out with surviving. Once you got the basics down, you'll notice that you may be being watched.

They'll watch you from afar, just one or two weak looking ones and they'll judge if to attack you or not. You'll have standoffs where they decide to come a little closer but will immediately back off should you move in. Sometimes they'll run, sometimes they'll be hungry.

But that's not all. Should you kill one, the rest will know. If I were to take the life of a poor sea turtle for his shell and were to go back 5 minutes later, dont be surpised if theyre hovering over the corpse before spotting you. Or should you be happily building your base you'll notice another one of them but looking more important than the others. If you dont notice him, you'll hear his screams.

Night time becomes horrifying. If you dont have a source of light, you pretty much wont know what hit you when they decide they want to eat you. 

And there are caves. I've yet to truly explore them but Ive seen enough down there to say you'll probably be sh*tting yourself.

TL;DR Its pretty, it feels alive, the building system is great (albeit a little grindy) and it definitely has a good horror feel. Which makes it shine out from the rest. (Hopefully going to try Co-op too)

If you're bored of Rust/7 Days To Die/Ark or anything like that. This is it.
This game is criminally under-priced for what you get.
I've had this since very early alpha, but would happily have paid £30 for it.
At £15.49 without being on sale, this is just straight out a must buy for anybody into the crafting/survival genre.

The Forest and Subnautica are unarguably the top of their field.
I have spent the last 4 and a half days reading through ALL of the code, and I mean all 1500+ source files from 19 compiled binaries that came with the Alpha.

While the engine, its systems and all the various functions across the entire game show that it is EXTREMELY early in the games development timeline (almost to the point you could say only-just-started). HOWEVER, and this is a really big HOWEVER, hence the caps. The different core functions that create the game (Physics, AI, Crafting, Environment, Survival, Graphics) are impressive in their construction. They have used some of the top add-ins for unity to speed up the games creation and improve the complexity of several core systems, and built on top of that base to create the alpha we are playing now. It is likely the integration of these systems so that they work together in unison is the reason for the initial release delays. Likely the graphical side.

The bits we really care about, Items, AI, Crafting, Survival Mechanics and World interaction are all setup in such a way that adding new things, improving current stuff or replacing parts entirely is easy from a coding perspective, thanks to the methods they use to pass information and trigger functions across entities in the game world.

Most of what we are experiencing in the Alpha is what I call place-holder code. Simple versions of what the function should do once it has been developed. Just enough code so that the function will not crash the game, or another function if it is called. SO MANY functions do not even have code written for them. They do nothing when or if they are even called.
Some areas are of course further developed than others. Building structures and crafting is quite fleshed out fundamentally, the AI is all ready for family based societies and most of the complex roaming and searching code is not being used. Combat is not even their really. being able to collide with things and pass functions calls allows the simplistic fighting and moving we have in the game, and I seriously think this will be replaced entirely.

My guess is that the first few patches will be stability and integration patches. These will improve the functions in the areas most reported and further integrate the different add-ins with their own code, and finally customizing those add-ins further to support the game they want to create. Further content, like additional craftables and buildables, and more complex AI (like family society) will probably not come until another patch or two has past. Depending on the assets they have ready now, and the complexity of how those are used in game, we will see a handful of craftables, items or buildings added in any patch, but big content will be later. We are likely to see movement, collision, combat and item interaction improve dramatically in the next two patches, as well as performance increases and general stability.

I also assume that the integration of these add ins, and customizing them would be quite complex and time consuming. Working with other peoples code can be time consuming and unpredictable until you are as familiar with that code as you would be your own. These add-ins are not simple little modules, they are advanced highly developed and quite complex systems. As time passes, the dev's will get more and more familiar with the coding of these, and development speed will increase.

I found no evidence (in my mind) that suggested any aspect of what they advertised was false or misleading as far as what the game is becoming. In fact the code suggests that the game is going to be a lot more than what we know already. There are some really cool things that just are not used or spoken of at all.
I highly recommend this game! not only is it graphicly stunning but so much attention to detail has been paid to the intricacies within the gameplay. The A.I. is great and has ironicly been the cause of some bad reviews because people simply haven't understood that the natives have so many different character traits and responses to your interaction with them. Sometimes you cause fear, sometimes intrigue, these natives don't act in a singular 'standard' manner. Your interaction with them and the habitat around you all contribute to the circumstances you will find yourself in.

Early Access can be a minefield, I know, I have supported quite a few but I would like to point out that the developers of this game are the most hard working and dedicated team I have come across in the Early Access Genre. (If you don't believe me, go and check out their changelog for the last 12 months) As soon as you boot the game it will tell you when the next update is due (on average, every 28 days) and every update consists of a massive list of changes, fixes and tweaks.

There is no good reason I can think of not to buy this game if you like the survival genre, it ticks more boxes than any other game of it's type. Even in its early access state it is fantastic!!

11/10
I have barely scratched the surface and i can already tell you this is the best survival game i have played to date (Not that i have played many but w/e). The technical aspect of the game is top notch, beautiful graphics,  very good performance and not to mention the sounds which are incredible. 

When i started the game i expected the cannibals to be simple enemies that charge at you as soon as they see you but as it turns out they are far more in depth than that, it feels as if they are about as confused about your presence in the forest as you are of them. The way they behave (besides some occasional pathing bugs) is really good. Other than being a survival game it can be quite scary too.  Don't even get me started on the caves. I shat myself when i first got killed and dragged down into one of them with nothing more but a lighter (Which had a lighting range of roughly a meter)  and an axe with me. Or when i entered a village hoping it would be empty just to get charged by a whole army of cannibals. The game can be properly scary. If you are not up for that than there is also a peaceful difficulty with no cannibals. It does seem kinda pointless to me as the only challenge in surviving are the cannibals as food and water is very easy to get. 

All in all a definitely recommended game
I could write a little story about any number of awesome situations this game will throw at you. But I don't feel like it truely explains what you will be buying.

Here is what this game offers:
Pretty graphics - The game looks awesome,from watching the sunrise because you finally got a break from the night raiding parties to watching the sun disappear knowing things go bump in the night and every moment inbetween is beautiful. 

Focused crafting - Everything has a purpose or is planned to have a purpose..even the little things like cutting up a cannibal and showcasing him in your yard will upset his buddies.

Active devs - I've never seen another EA project match their dedication. On the home menu, it literally has a countdown timer for the upcoming patch. These devs actually give themselves a deadline so they don't lose focus and they use that time to give meaningful updates and minor changes. They listen to their customers. I've seen them add features, tweak features and remove features based on feedback. Your opinion matters here.

True horror - Players have put hundreds of hours into the forest, explored every inch of the island, built a fortress and slayed hundreds of cannibals...yet still refuse to leave their base at night or dive deeper into the caves unless they're stuffed with flares and explosives. There is an element of fear in this game that you never really get used to. Things lurk in the shadows, make unnerving sounds, harass you at night, sneak up on you during the day and drag you into the dark when they win.

A story - Son gets nabbed, theres a door in a hole. Right now, the story is still in the works and I expect it will be all the way up to release. but, little things are released here and there that really  make you want more.

Building - Matched with a horror atmosphere, this is done really well. You build with wood, sticks and stones. You can lay a blueprint for a pre-built structure or build something unique piece by piece. You can build in the tree tops or out in the ocean..both have their positives and negatives. Building a base will keep out the night but there is no promise of safety as things can still find a way in.



Truely, a game I love.
Very fun and scary at times with friends. Love the base building and having to have to build your own "community" with your friends and chopping up people.
Even with this game being in Early Access, I still find it really fantastic and I'm sure you will too if you're a fan of survival horror that's not all about PVP and killing other player/zombies and loot the weapons. 

This game really focus on surviving and building. It has so much potential and many great things are still being added to the game to make it even more awesome! The developers themselves has been working well with that too, a while ago the game didn't even have multiplayer and now it's already working nicely with steam! There are little bugs here and there but each updates are really promising. 

I really recommend this game to play with your friends!
Very few games of this type deliver like The Forest has. 

This has to be one of the few games that can give goosebumps and make me squeal like a little girl, no matter how many hours I put into it.

The enemy AI is magnificent. At first you might see a cannibal acting curiously around you; following you around, yet keeping a safe distance. After a little bit they will test you... Maybe hit you once, then run away to see how you react. Another interesting example, is when I encountered a couple of them surrounding a corpse. They seemed to be very protective of it, running in circles around it, as to say "This is mine. Stay away". After a little bit of playing around with them to see how they would react, I found myself surrounded by several more and mauled in a territorial dispute. Another awesome feature in the AI is that you can go many days laying low, without them even knowing of your presence, while if one spots you near your base, they will come back later in a larger group to investigate, marking the area with effigies to warn others of your presence.

Night time is absolutely terrifying before you establish a solid defensive base.  Even then, while remaining undetected, there are warring tribes fighting amongst themselves throughout the night.

Overall, I highly recommend this game. If you are a fan of survival or horror games, you owe it to yourself to check this one out!
One of the best survival games out. Good combination of horror, survival, base building, exploration, combat, and strategy. The company making this game have done an awesome job in making it balanced and limiting bugs. Highly recommended.
I REALLY like this game. It started off with many bugs, but has come a LONG way! The reasons I like this game:
1) The AI: The AI is extremely impressive. The natives apparently climb up trees (I say apparently because I have not seen it myself), have hunting parties and scouts, are creepy and it's hard to predict their next move. E.G I encountered a group of 3 natives once, and they ran around me and made some form of a triangular shape around me. I went forward to one of them who backed away. Then I turned to another one who dashed forward, and instead of attacking me like I thought they would, they stopped closer to me, where I then attacked them. This time one of the others came at me from behind and the other made a load roar/shrieking sound alerting their friends of my presence. The hit from behind stunned my character and I was brought down by the natives.
2) The Atmosphere: The game produces an eerie atmosphere, especially at night. When I hear a native laughing or screaming it sends me running to my base, or hiding from them wherever I can. Even when there are no natives around, I'm still at the ready, as I never know when I might come across a native hunting party.
3) The Graphics: For an indie game the graphics are amazing! The light coming through the leaves is a nice touch. The graphics are stunning for an indie game. End of.
4) The Gameplay: Now the most important part of the game. The gameplay. I do like good graphics but when there's good gameplay ,good graphics aren't NEEDED (THIS DOES NOT MEAN EITHER OR. I LIKE BOTH TOGETHER!). The game is a great mix of horror and survival, not making it like a horror game where you find a few cool items and nothing else, but at the same time not making it like a hardcore survival game with some enemies, hardly capable of stopping you. It balances the two just right. It is best to gather resources to build a base, and then look for resources to make more tools to aid my fight against the natives. There are still a few unique tools, that cannot be crafted, but I won't say what they are because you might  want to find out for yourself and get a great feeling when you find them. The natives are powerful, creepy and terrifying. Now scores!
The AI: I think they are a great enemy to have in the game, and this is in an alpha build! Some little glitches but overall they're great. 9.5/10
The Atmosphere: It's eerie and suits the game perfectly! I like a good atmosphere in a game, and The Forest really deserves a mention for the atmosphere it creates. Obviously co-op is a little less scary, but they can probably find a way to make it a creepy a singleplayer. 9/10
The Graphics: The graphics are brilliant for an indie game, but there is room for some improvement. Also playermodels are limited but who really cares what you look like in a game? 8.5/10
The Gameplay: The atmosphere and the gameplay work very well together. Obviously some room for improvement. 9/10
Overall: I've had so much fun playing The Forest. I will have a lot more fun playing The Forest. The game is a great game overall. It has many elements to it, and will still get better... 9.5/10
P.S I don't really write reviews for games, but The Forest definetely deserved one.
Wow. Creepiest game ever?

First 10 hours were mostly learning. Learning to survive, hunt, hide, explore.
Max intensity - exploring the caves is one of the hardest moments I've played so far.

Haven't finished it, and don't even know how to finish it. But I'm hooked. Being lost in the forest was never this much fun. And scary.
A friend and I decided to play this together, one might expect it's less scary that way... Boy, were we wrong...

It started all peacefully, we crashed, we survive, get things like food and shelter, try to hunt turtles for their shells to make water catching bowls from... And so we hoped to be settled. On the first night we did encounter some enemies, beaten them fairly easily, not much special.

But as the days progress, unexpected things start to happen. Enemies start to sometimes come by at daytime... Not too much trouble to deal with, but slightly worrisome. Then, this huuuge mutant suddenly slowly struds behind our camp with too many arms and legs attached to it, and as soon it spotted us it runs towards us and just knocks entire trees over! It takes many arrows, lots of dodging and much more cursing to take it down, but we did it. Standing over the corpse wondering what the Hell it is...

A few days pass with lesser spawns, but then, we hear that same sound again, oh Hell no... We carefully look from the other side of our camp and... Two of them!? This time we bailed, and lost each other in the woods, sneaking around but some lesser enemies find us, each of us fighting them and fleeing from the bigger ones for an entire game's day, eventually we get back safe to our camp and the enemies seem to have lost us, but man, 6 hours in and this much already happens, we feel we haven't scraped the surface yet, but what an amazing horrifying opening already! 

Oh and it was only like 15-16 Euros!
On the surface, this looks like a stock survival game. Hunt, gather, craft, rek, repeat. But this game is SO MUCH MORE than that. The story is amazing, and the ending is everything I hoped LOST would be. Its incredibly fun multiplayer, has regular content updates, patches, and fixes, runs smoothly, and is beautiful to look at. Plus, nothing is better than killing armsies with samurai swords.
One of my favourite crafting/survival games. 

There is a lot to do in this game. You can build forever, or not build at all. 
The island is fairly big, but with experience and time, the landmarks will start to seem more like actual landmarks.

This game is pretty tough when you start out. You are literally thrown into a world, with nothing in front of you except the world, and an axe. You’ll have to survive, find clues and weapons, hunt for food, and discover caves in order to find our son, Timmy.

Do not be intimidated, because if you mark your journey, navigating the map and which areas youve already been to, will make it your overall experience organized, and better.

There is no dialog in this game. The mechanics are not terrible.  The enemies can be pretty scary, and this game is pretty much black, when its night time in the forest. 

Theres a few bugs in the game, but not enough to ruin the game. Small things, like model clipping. 
Ive thoroughly enjoyed this game. The replayability and co-op make this game very fun. The story and environment is a bit messed up and gruesome, but overall, a fun experience.
Finally a game that doesn't define survival as running from other players and staying up all night to keep your base protected from offline raiding.

In The Forest, the world is your enemy. You can die of starvation, dehydration, cold, and bloodthirsty cannibals that will always try to get you - or also scare you at night. Building and gathering here actually serves a purpose and helps you live to see the next day.

There is a mysterious story to uncover, goals to follow and locations to explore. The island is full of life and almost breathtaking scenery.

Provided the above is what you're looking for, there will hardly be any room for disappointment. For replayability and PVP, look into PUBG.
Let me say something. The best writers behind this story made a great series of events. First your plane crashed and you have to survive and a lot of things you can find and play with em somehow. The Cannibals and those zombie people, beasts in jungle and caves and the end boss are great. only problem here is performance and optimization of the game need some work but its great at all. every 30min you'll hear a scream sound in game and i gotta say its brilliant !
Buy it and play with your friends. Enjoy :)
Seems okay, Playing in VR is alot of fun but I get motion sick after awhile. Only vr-able game that made me feel sick so far.

Great co-op! $20 buy in and I got 40 hours out of it.  Decent building options, great gathering mechanics, really great AI and settings. And the ending was great
Awesome game :
-Plays great
-Looks good
-Sounds are sweet and immersive
-Runs on averagely bad pc's
-You get a feeling of evolving from a passenger with just a lighter in his pocket to a survivialist capable of taking care of himself
-Multiplayer is on point and does not influence the game in a bad way
-A more than fair price
-Story aint that interesting but can get you to learn the game more easily by pushing you to explore and discover new places and equipment
-The mood and atmosphere is perfect, you actually feel like wandering the woods in fear of encountering a cannibal
-The typical kind of game to give you memories, like the one time me and my friend went searching for something in a cave located far from our camp and didnt get back in time so we ended up returning home at night, in the dark, and saw for the first time some kind of strange figure walking with a group of cannibals, so we got close before realising it was some kind of mutant son of incest that looked and sounded really disturbing, so we made molotov coktails and threw them at him which made him rush us while screaming in agony and agitating everywhere and following us to our camp before dying in a trap we had set up, and the game is full of moments like these
-Game is kinda hard but it all depends on your choices, for example passing the night sleeping or building your camp is less dangerous than going in the woods with only a ligher as a light source/ Difficulty changes durring gameplay, for example your first night will generally be setting up a campfire, get attacked by some "humanoid" cannibals and rekt them with some nice placed and timed attacks, when your 20th night would be trying to push 3 mutant creatures away from one of your base's tall wooden walls so that they dont get in to destroy your farm
-The enemy AI reminds me of the old half life one, smart and unpredictible, but not too overpowered and always leaves you a chance of staying alive
-Combat has a lot of possibilities, from strategically prepared ambushes with traps and throwables to straight out running right into your enemies with an axe and blocking when needed
-Building is fun and well thought, but might get annoying with occasionally getting a whole tribe to come and destroy a thing you spent time gathering wood to build
-Some minor bugs not influencing the gameplay (and rarely occuring) such as items clipping into the ground ect...
-Strange crafting system based on intuition, but there are guides on internet to help on that part
-FPS drops for low tier pc's
-Aiming with a gun or a bow can be hard at times

Overall a fantastic game, and probably one of the best in his category, worth buying
A must have
One thing I really appreciate this game compared to others in its genre is that it both runs very well and is aesthetically and technically pleasing. It's a great looking game, and it really shows how far Unity Engine has come.

The loneliness and helplessness you feel at the start is strong, and fighting off the mutants can be hard as hell at times as well. Every time you think you can keep going, one will get one more hit on you than you did him and you're down for the count. It's nerve-wracking, but riveting at the same time. Really very interesting.

I've yet to try out a lot of the multiplayer component, but I've heard good things.

I appreciate this game being as good as it is for its price. I got it in Early Access, and let it stew in my library for a while so the devs could iron out the rifts. I'm glad I did. I'm glad I supported their cause.

Worth it.
Disclaimer
The review only represents my "thoughts and feelings" at this point in time.(Both are subject to change XD  )

I'm still new so i may be missing a trick or two but i have spent 6 hours trying to get past the zombie things to get the modern axe 100% fail lol 
playing on peaceful was nice was a true survival game have to eat, keep warm, find shelter and worry about energy. for that alone the game is amazing just wish combat was more balanced in the reg game  ( i have 54 strength and the hostiles still cant die ).

visually the game is amazing.
with so much to go explore, i could spend weeks exploring the island and find something new every day.

if you are new like i am check out Farket, he makes great how to videos and shows neat building projects 

 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY2i-o_WsKTcos0sdsyN_PA
LOVE this game. Reminds me of ARk, but more horror survival and of course, no dinosaurs. Just creepy cannibals... Just getting started with the game, but looking forward to losing weekends to this game.
Why am i when i play multiplayer game (join to other player world), i do can save but when i restarted my pc the save its gone. i really hate that man. Please fix this asap ty
The Forest has consistently been the one game that I find myself going back to play. Through multiple steam accounts, and new games being released every month, The Forest is the main one that just never gets old for me. The graphics are beautiful and the addition of headphones makes it very easy to immerse myself into that world. Each update they come out with, in my opinion, makes the game better and better, and this is coming from someone who thought the game was amazing while it was still in early access. By far one of my top 3 favorite games of all time, and I constantly find myself recommending it to friends.
If you got no friend to play with them The Forest, dont buy it.
If you do, you got a least 50 hour's of pure funny/glitchy/retarded moments to think about them on 3am five years later.
Love this game, love it, love it, love it, I play it for hours an will continue to play it, so much fun, looks great, sounds amazing, really imersive, the first time I was in a cave almost died in real life, it was like being in the decent movie but worse! wow the developers did great here!
I saw some videos about this game in the Alpha stages. So i decided to play it for myself on full release. Let's start with the graphics... There awesome. moving onto gameplay, it's pretty solid its fluid, combat system is ok for the most part it could be improved but its not bad. The map is a large sandbox for creativity and adventures. You can discover lots of strange things and details. You also get a wide range of weapons and tools which are fun to mess around with. There is little customization besides making your base anyway you want. But for character customization you can change your clothing that's all but i feel like this game does not need in depth character  or weapon creation. I can't think of many downsides of The Forest, i can see how some people would think this is just another building and crafting game, well you're not wrong but what can i say it's just better than most i have played. Story wise you can just skip the story and play for the crafting and building. But it's far better than you might think, when you play The Forest for the first time it's just a big mystery you might get some clues and try to piece it together. I'm trying not to spoil anything here. I don't know what else to say it's just fun and it's not a bad price for what it is.
First 22 minutes broken down
-My son was taken by a bloody naked body builder
-I ate almost everything on a crashed plane
-I built a monument out of heads and arms
-I sniped a bird out of the air with a bow
-A group of angry bloody tribal men came out of the woods
-One of them crawled up a tree and yeeted me down

SOLID 8/10
Fairly good, provides real challenge and spooks for noobs, and once get used to that stuff you can move up to a hard diff. or just go online and build giant colab projects. 
The modding community is also still very active, shoutout to Hazard and Moritz, there are plenty of mods to make the game more challenging or simply fix/add things for your liking.
Amazing game. Definitely one of the most realistic and well made, horror survival game out there! 
The single player is good, with magnificent map to explore, (carefully though, cannibals out there). The crafting system is exposing games like Rust & 7D. No jumpscares needed to make you feel uncomfortable, just the aura of the game. The Forest it self gives you endless freedom to do whatever you like, and make your own playstyle. Coo-op is also great, and totally worth to play with friends. If you are into survival games, with rich crafting, variety of encounters, a perfect enviroment, and a huge map to search, explore and get lost, this game is JUST FOR YOU! I recommend it no doubt.
Highly atmospheric, challenging and fun. Enemies (certain creatures) are OP in my opinion though, and your hard work building walls and defenses can easily be dwindled; in this sense the game is not very "rewarding". Would still recommend.
amazing game to play with friends. I find it very cool that the enemies in the game all have set patrol routes that you have to avoid in order to survive. i've beaten this game with a friend and it was a lot of fun. single player is pretty good while I havent played much of single player it still is a great horror game at heart.
here is my review on the account of this game: the game is good, just wonderful. here you can have fun with friends and make many discoveries. now the truth is becoming increasingly difficult to do, because crafts are changing the appearance of the buildings is also changing, and the nostalgia for the old design remains. I would also like to ask you to add a female character so that girls can play on behalf of the girl. if such a function is already available, then put it on the main screen, please. wonderful game, thank you.
I do enjoy these types of games (survival horror building) genre and I found "the forest"  to be entertaining and I would gladly buy a sequel from you guys. I like that its an open world, crafting is interesting and the cannibals running around I enjoyed, well moslty how they moved around the world and engaged with you. Felt no remorse while torturing them. However there are some things that I didnt like such as the story and the building in the game. The story to me is bad and it feels like it was made in 5 mins to give some purpose. Maybe I didnt spend enough time playing yet but I finished the game just now and im left with wtf was this. Like wtf is Timmy, whats with the stupid construction beneath the ground? Like who would make a base like that underground with narrow corridors and a huge room with glass floor for a purpose unknown. To study the freaks that they would throw below to watch them fight and bet on it or wtf. Where are the artifacts from? Since when do commercial planes crash and have survivors. Noone noticed a big island with fresh water and cannibals running around? Whats with the fucking tennis rackets everywhere. Seriously I do think this masterpiece story was written in about 5 mins or whats more likely was given to you by a pizza boy that delivered pizza to your office and told this idea to one of your game disigners while waiting for his change. But whatever maybe answers will be in the sequel. But my main disapointment was that "the forest" is the first game that I did not want to build anything. Maybe its a thing for multiplayer but why would you build here? Like I started the game on normal just to check it out then a few hours later changed to hard and finished it after watching some videos on you tube. In my entire playthru I didnt for a second think that I need a house here. Like what is the purpose of the house here? Games like green hell, conan exiles, the lone dark you really need a house to keep a stash and here with the rubber backpack I did not see a reason to build at all and when I tried to build I found the process to be extremly tedious. So basically building is hard and time consuming in this game and totally not needed) In any case I enjoyed the game and hope to try your future products.
Actually a MegaPog™ game with great gameplay mechanics coupled with a story you want to unravel. MegaFun™ with friends and leaves you wanting for more! YES
I just got this game (as a gift) and so far I love it. It's pretty cool that it has blueprints/glowing outline, so you can see what you are trying to build, as you put materials into it.  A lot of materials, interesting combinations to make items, not your average crafting game. Not a fan of watching the cannibals run and lunge at night...but yeah, good stuff.
Awesome game.  Give it a go.  Seriously.  Great minimalist crafting (not tedious), very intense and scary moments, you are always on your toes.  Fun to explore and do things your way, with some suspense always. Well done dev's.
I spent the whole day collecting rocks and sticks to build myself a little house, and these damn naked locals come and try to breach my wall and beat me up. Two can play at this game. I eat the cannibals to show my dominance. Stepping on a man's front lawn without his consent? That shit ain't cool.
Most survival games lack "pressure", as in cannibals trying to eat you the whole time.

This game has pressure. I am not at all a fan of survival or base building games (minecraft, yuck) but this game kept me busy much longer than the pricetag cost me (extra points I got it on sale!).

10/10 will katana cave for the 57th time again.
Here is what i can tell you. This game has stand the test of time with me. I played it when it came out had a bunch of fun then moved on to other likewise games.
 Came back and played it again and had fun again! 
And here is a little tip... 

If you want to know how well this game is doing Atlas with all its hype of hosting to 40k players and large scale maps. Was neck to neck with The Forest in player base yesterday both of them at 9k players logged in!!!

The forest no hype and smaller map has as many people playing it as ATLAS the pirate game that steals your money rofl
This game beat my expectations. 

When it comes to survival games usually you either get a husk (once you establish a little camp...Congrats...you've officially reached endgame), or...you end up in a cluster F multiplayer situation like rust or ark grinding out resources so that a naked zerg monkey show can roll by and wreck it while potentially kidnapping your sleeping character (while you're not even in game) so that they can keep you prisoner (to harvest your poop...because why not). But enough about those others...the Forest was a breath of fresh tree scented air.

There is decent story in the Forest for you to piece together (mostly buried in the extensive caves), and the survival elements are well done with the added gravity of an escalating cannibal threat. The way the violence tiers upward as you are on the peninsula longer and make more of an impact on the environment is pretty fun. Building is intuitive (better than it is in some big budget games) - it goes pretty fast with a friend or two, otherwise it can take a while depending on how ambitious you are.

Couple of suggestions (these may seem like common sense but hey)...upgrade your bag space asap. Stick bag...rock bag. My lord they are helpful when you are trying to build anything. The sled is a huge help too. Also keep in mind that you can slide logs down zip lines if you want to build on an island or something. Oh, and for rabbit hunting (so that you can make your bags) a slingshot makes it much easier than trying to hit them with a thrown spear or chase them around.

The combat is pretty basic, and can be laggy/clunky if your are playing on a friend's game and their computer is a bit slow. Otherwise I did not really have any complaints. 

It's worth the money even at full price, but seems to go on sale pretty often as well. Have fun, try not to get eaten.
A lot off my play was in offline, so ive got closer to 25 hours played. This game really puts survival at the forefront. The enemy AI is a lot more complex than most games. worth way more than $20, play it

I personally dislike material farming / building games "minecraft - ark" and felt the same towards this game at the beginning, later I explored a couple of dungeons / areas and the loot was great and even better was the dungeon design and the way the lore of what happened in certain areas unfold's itself to you as you explore and look around the place.

To sum it up, this game had some of my favorite exploring moments and the map design "specially at the final area" is mind blowing.

Highly recommended to play in co-op mode.
If you like being chased by naked cannibal tribe women and also men,this game are for you!
Fun to play with friend not alone..The sensation when you killed them and eat their meat are ...................
Great game to play with friends. 

It's challenging enough to keep you going forward. 
But, be careful... The more you push the environement, the worst it gets!
This is a good game. There's still a ton the devs need to work on, but this is a very good game. One thing this game is VERY good at is making you check over your shoulder. Just, all the time. Even when you're hiding safely behind your wall.
For a Co-Op game it can be quite good in theory for a game made by 4 guys.  The Dedicated server needs abit of work work, at time of writing i am experiencing version issues but i still recommend this game.
Me and my best friend playing the forest.
It's HardSurvival, nameplates are off.
We made pinetreehouses, platforms in the trees, very save and away from cannibals.
They didn't find our camp yet, even though we were REALLY close to a cannibal camp and we encountered multiple patrols.
It's day 7, time for mutant boys.
I told my friend specificly that he should NOT bring the cannibals to our camp or NOT to KILL any cannibals.
We go adventuring and enter a cave to locate some resources, nearly jumped off a cliff.
My friend exits the cave first and encounters a posse of cannibals.
First thing he does is running away, screaming... That's fine.
He keeps trying to lose the posse, but he has no stamina and needs food.
Only food we have is at our base, cave is very close at our base though.
I run towards the base, haven't heard of my friend for a while, thinking he would've probably lost them... or he died.
Doin' my thing
Suddenly my friend appears, no health, no stamina, very hungry and thirsty.
I look behind him, suddenly 10 cannibals at our base, running around like rats under our tree.
He tells me he had to kill some cannibals.
Me yelling: "WHAT THE FUCK DUDE, WHAT DID YOU DO!? WHAT DID I TELL YOU!?"
I hear trees falling down, loud thumping noises and loud growling.
Fearing for the worst.
Chickenboi running through the woods at the speed of sound, destroying everthing on it's path.
Armsie flailing around, destroying trees around us, eventually reaching our base and destroying our base.
Me whimpering, because this happened on our last couple of playthrough too.
Closes the game, told my friend i'm not going to play this game for a while.
Plays the game the other day, new playthough with the same dude.

7 days/10, would eat many cannibals again.
Today its about the Game "The Forest", if you love survival-horror Games, then "The Forest" is the best one 


I like this game because its very funny and it got so many Items from the Start in the Alpha and Beta Version to now.


Its not so exhausting for me to get all items from the game, (I am not using any mods for the game) because I know where the are. 


I everytime liked this Game.
I enjoyed the experience for the most part.  However, after 40 hours of play I died with no save game to roll back to that could get me out of my current situation.  So I died and I don't think I have the will to start over.  Its pretty scary, some what fun and rewarding.  But will I put in another 40 hours?  Not sure... Maybe.
VR Performance destroyed since content patch v1.10 (December last year) and still no fix for this issue.
VR support is fake advertising at the moment! No one can play this game with 20-60fps in VR with low details.

Even a CPU 6700k@4,7 and 2080Ti cant handle this crap.

I will change my review if the developer fix this broken game.
i found it incredibly boring even with friends, people seem to love this i feel like im doing shit wrong. The crafting is boring, combat is boring, crafting is tedious and a bit confusing and the world wasnt interesting. Find a native camp and theres no one there and only cans of soda to find and it's the only thing i've seen besides trees for like an hour. I just don't get the fun in it myself
So, This is a good game, But its missing some content. Let me explain: 
This is an amazing game that is very fun with friends, But that's the problem. You see, This game doesn't have nearly enough content with how long its been out and the only time its fun is with friends. Not because the game is fun, but because your friends are fun. Overall 5/10 its good for like the first 2-3 hours then after that you realize how bland and empty the game is. If you want it, wait until a sale. Its not worth its $20(USD) Price tag, Also don't get it if you plan on playing by yourself. However this is my opinion, But i stand by the fact the game has bugs, lack of content, and average story. Feel free to leave a comment saying why this game is good, i might change my mind.
I wanted to like this game, but there are so many issues that make it an unpleasant experience.  Firstly visual clutter in the forest, it's too hard to find what you're looking for.   The motion blur when you move and excessive brightness can be nauseating.   Buggy interactions... why can't I drink at this pool/interact with this item, when I'm standing right in front of it? Want to kill that rabbit in your trap? Oops you just axed your trap, and the rabbit ran away.  Could we have a confirmation box before we accidentally destroy an important item? The game could do with a gentler introduction to the keys and crafting menu.  Hide the cosmetic items till later.   Design wise, the grotesqueness could be dailed down a lot.  Body parts and severed heads as casual decoration, that actually depletes the horror by making the player immune to it.   The tension needs to be dailed up before delivering any gore.
Glad i bought this game on sale played for a while built a house boat but soon discovered lots of things are still broken made a fire which worked for a while then couldnt do anything with it like cook which is quite important for a survival game so tried a drying rack put rabbits on it worked for the first couple i put on then couldnt use it had meat on it but could not interact with it just like the fire very frustrating. Now i know why i didnt buy this game before yet another survival game that does not live up to expectations. At least get the basic stuff to work for gods sake like i said glad i only spent £10 on it.
This game was fun as fuck with friends until the shit multiplayer save system fucked both of their items over forcing each person to individually save, and not just the host, if you are looking for a singleplayer expierence then buy it, for multi buy it but be careful or you can ruin the entire vibe of the game and ruin all your friends progress
Is fun the first time, but is is very limited and boring when you are trying to discover new things. The story is interesting but needs more elements in so the whole thing isn't a Game Theory episode. The graphics are great but some parts of the game seem cheaply designed. AI of enemies is beyond stupid as the "cannibals" seem smart at times but in reality are no smarter than a kid with a potato implanted to be his brain. The game overall is glitchy, short, and bland. I would give this game a 2 out of 5.
Remember when a shitload of early access survival games came out and they were all pretty meh? Cool concepts, neat mechanics, but not much depth... Yeah The Forest is still there.
This game is a fun crafting and survival game centered on some cannibals and a crash on an island. Like Lost, except people eat you and such. Good stuff, and is great for a few hours of play with friends. 

Sadly , this game came out 5 years ago and is still mostly an unfinished mess. Glitches, no basic MP features like moderation, and a lot of scenarios where you can completely lose everything you worked for to a bug. Clearly the developers made their money and are not interested in developing the game into something they can sell for years. 

Developers - Take a hint from another survival game on steam, based in space, that has been continually developed and therefore has a strong mod community and amazing sales.
this game has some real potential for VR, but as a left handed person, it's unplayable. I really hope to see an update that makes this functional for a left handed person. if you select not to use right hand for items, all the controls are wonky AF. also, they invert the models for left and right hand, so all paper you hold is literally backwards. I really wanted to play this, but I guess I won't be enjoying this in VR for awhile. PLEASE CONSIDER LEFTIES. I prefer to move with my right hand controls so that I can focus on hand/arm controls with my left. it's really hard to walk and swing at a target at the same time.
I find survival games to be hit or miss, walking the tight rope of giving the player enough to do while keeping the game open-ended enough to feel like your primary mission is to just live. 

The Forest severely lacks in that first department. There's just not much to do. The hostiles are also prevalent enough that they inhibit exploration. There are much better options available in this genre.
This is NOT something that should be out of early access. It's still unfinished (save for the story) and riddled with bugs and nonsensical design choices. VR doubly so but at least they admit that's still beta. It's not a [i]bad[/i] game, but its absolutely half cocked and has game breaking bugs and crashes that are just absolutely frustrating beyond measure. The dedicated server is also an absolute train wreck. Buyer beware.
This one is controversial. While one of the best survival games out there, it's still a piece of shit. Maybe the whole genre of survival games is just garbage. We will never know.
The Forest has a long way to go before it is really playable. It can be fun with friends, but is incredibly boring and generally too difficult to play solo. It's life 7 Days to Die if 7 Days was even more broken. I'd give this game a 2/5. It just feels incomplete.
The story really leave more question than answer. What are these alien artifact ? where do they come from ? who make them? 
The combat is clunky and feel unresponsive and the game physic can go crazy sometime.
I can't recommend this game in its current state. It's buggy as hell, crashes a lot more than it should, and has serious problems with its core systems. Enemies have a ridiculous amount of health and combat is a freaking slog instead of a fun back and forth. Hunting is also a chore because you can't choose which animals spawn so if you need a specific hide you're SOL. 

I'm sure there are super powerful items that you can get early ( stumbled across a nice cache of resources early game) which alleviate some of these problems, but frankly I can't be bothered to look for them. It also won't solve disappearing arrows and floaty attacks from both you and the mutants.
