Apart from several technical issues, this is an amazing game. Personally, I think, it's even better than GTA V. The story is deep and the characters are very well written.
---
NOTE: The following guide may be outdated because the game has received an unexpected update today.
The guide how to play:
1)Install X Live Less,
2)Install NTA's budget fix,
3)Remove paul.dll file from the game folder,
4)Create file named "commandline.txt" in the game folder with following content:
" -nomemrestrict -norestrictions"
5)Install some mods for your taste (I recommend VisualIV and Killatomate's Realistic Driving),
6)Experience the masterpiece.
MY RATING 7.5/10

Things to remember:

-GTA IV has a lot of problems. Rockstar Games doesn't seem to care about that. You just can't fix them all but you could definetely make the game playable in the best possible manner.

-This game works absolutely fine on Windows 10, 8.1 and 8 but it just isn't optimized for modern PCs. I'd recommend to play this game on Windows XP (Sp3) or Windows Vista compability mode from properties of GTAIV executable (Launcher.exe) 

-Game For Windows Live client needs to be manually installed from xbox site.

-If you don't want to play multiplayer or don't want Game For Windows Live then simply install x-llive-leess dll (censored by Steam) files on the game directory folder.

-The Steam default version of the game which is the latest version of GTAIV (1.0.8.0) released in December 2016 does not support any kinds of MODs so please don't install any MOD without downgrading your game or it will probably break your game and mess up with your game files. 
Always create a back-up copy for safety. If you want to run MODS in GTAIV then you must downgrade and install patch 1.0.4.0 for best performance that was released in 2008. Some MODS also work on 1.0.7.0 that was released in 2010. Patches are to be manually installed from Rockstar Games official website (search on web) 

-Check out community guides for bug fixes, patches, xlivless tool to disable GFWL. Check out awesome mods on YouTube.

-I hold no credit to any of the fixes mentioned above and hold no guarantee that this would work 
 for everyone. It just works 95% times. These are just optional downloads.

-Please do not download or install anything if you don't know what you are doing or don't trust me or the respected authors of softwares because aside from patches everything is made up by the community and fans. 

Game ON!

Pros
-Amazing Story

Feel free to inbox me if there is any error or want help :)
In my opinion, one of the best Grand Theft Autos made.

Story:

To be honest, story-wise, this is by far my favorite Grand Theft Auto. The characters, the atmosphere, and the backstory all blend together to make a great story. I like the story a lot more than GTA V, because I feel like there's more substance to the game. Niko Bellic is not a bad person on the inside. He's a tortured soul that's been through a lot, and the only reason he does what he does is to stay alive so he can make it out of the pits that he was forced into. in GTA V, it's really just another heist story that doesn't exactly have a deep plot. Also, I'm a sucker for mafia stories, and no GTA has done the whole mob story scheme better than GTA IV.

Gameplay/Physics:

Gameplay-wise, this is also probably my favorite out of all the Grand Theft Autos, primarily because it seems the most realistic out of all the games. The only thing that I could see people complaining about is the way that cars handle in this game, but honestly after a while it's really fun once you get the hang of it (This is coming from a guy who loves drift racing games. If you hate drifting, you're gonna hate the driving in this game) The car physics are amazing. The crumple points are super realistic compared to GTA V. Even the sound effects when you hit another car is super realistic. (I've been in a car accident before, and I've seen them happen, I know the sound.) The combat is also fantastic. This is the only GTA where the combat feels almost real. The AI is a lot smarter than in GTA V. When you shoot an enemy, they don't just flinch, they look like they actually got hit. They'll drop, they'll stagger backwards, they'll fall over, they'll put their hand where they just got shot. Much of the time enemies will limp away if you get them to the lowest health. In GTA V it seems a lot more like any other third person shooter, where they just flinch for a second and get up and start shooting again.

Multiplayer (and arguably the driving) is the only thing I can say GTA V did better, but if it had the physics and gameplay of GTA IV, you would instantly have the best GTA possible. The main problem with the GTA IV Multiplayer is that it just feels kinda pointless, you don't really work towards anything.

The only con that I can give this game for the PC is the fact that you need Windows Live to play it. I have never liked Windows Live, and I find it stupid that I'm forced to use it. However, that can't stop me from giving this game a positive review, because this really is one of my favorite games ever created.

9.5/10!
[h1]GTA IV > GTA V[/h1]

The reason I like GTA IV more than GTA V has nothing to do with the gameplay or graphics.

Niko Belić is the only character in the GTA series that not wanted to be criminal. He was in the Yugoslavian civil war, did bad stuff after this and came to the USA for a better future. He just wanted to live in peace. But yes, stuff happend and he was again in that lodge. Trailer No. 1 is not without a reason called "Things Will Be Different".

The story, the location, the characters, the music... everything is perfect for people like me.

I highly recommend this game. 110/10
Great story, good characters, superb graphs, simply a top game but....
just like GTAIII, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas, there is some work to do to get this game running on PC. Time is not standing still, you know and Rockstar and Steam are not helping a lot. This is how i got the game running on windows 10 based on forum readings and own experiments.
First of all thanks to anyone for posts and helping each other out on this one.
1. Download software
2. Start the game, click on desktop icon
3. Steam will install necessary files like Direct X - Windows LIVE - Securom protection
4. You will be asked to login to Rockstars Social Club, ignore this and exit / return to desktop
5. Go to your steam game folder and rename the file paul.dll to paul.old, this way you will
be never prompted again to login to Rockstars Social Club. You also can delete this paul.dll file
but one never knows if a decent update appears and paul.dll is necessary again.
6. As told in point 3, steam installed Windows LIVE but this is not supported anymore by Microsoft
and you will need to have it installed to start the game. Install Games for windows Marketplace, see link    http://www.xbox.com/en-us/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient
7. Start the GTAIV again by clicking on the desktop icon.
8. You will be asked to make an account on Windows Marketplace (mail and password required), do so as it is needed to save the game and store achievements. 
9. You are also asked to submit the serial key number which is provided by steam.
10. And to have a gamertag on Xbox live. If not create one (mail and password required) via starting the app Xbox in windows 10 after exiting the game. (i guess this app is also available in win 7 / 8). If not, here to find     http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-app
11. And there you go with the game.....for the lucky ones.
12. If you have a graphic card with more then 2GB memory, as I do, you're ingame graphic options are all set to minimum and can not be changed.
13. Right-click on GTA 4 under the Steam Library and select properties.
14. Under the general tab, click the set launch options button.
15. Enter the launch options you wish to apply (be sure to separate each code with a space) and click OK. For GTA 4 it is:       -nomemrestrict -norestrictions
16. Close the game's Properties window and launch the game.
17. Now, you can set your graphic options to it's max.

Auch, it start's with a SM scene, anyway, less painfull then getting the game installed.
The last mission (helicopter) is painfull as well, it has a glitch.
There is a workaround on the internet (use FRAPS & record settubg @ 30 fps) but hell, Rockstar where are you ??
All of the negitive reviews is people that doesn't know how to fix the game, GFWL is now down! Its the marketplace that is. This is how you fix it.

Download this: http://www.xbox.com/en-gb/live/pc/DownloadClient
Then go to your library and right click "Grand theft auto IV" and select "Properties" 

Then go to "General" And go to "Set launch options" And put in: -norestriction -availablevidmem 512 -percentvidmem100% Then start up the game. Then make a GFWL account or sign into your xbox account. Then download the update and play

And it works! 

-Steam summer sale 2015 buy of the year
I have always prefered this over GTA5 just because of the memories of it on PS3 and Xbox 360. 

Fixing the game and making it work is pretty easy. 
Option 1) Google "GTA 4 Steam 2018" and follow the guides
Option 2) Google "GTA 4 latest patch" and dowload/install 
Option 3) Deal with it. 

10/10 would reccomend. 

Oh, and you don't get banned for using reshade :)
I initially didn't recommend this game, but after I tried these steps down below I got the game working. The problem occurs if you are running Windows 10. Follow these steps if you are on a Windows 10 PC wanting to play GTA4.


1) Install Games for Windows Live @ http://www.xbox.com/en-US/LIVE/PC/DownloadClient 

2) Right click on Grand Theft Auto IV in your library

3) Click on Properties 

4) Click on the tab called "Local Files"

5) Click on "Browse Local Files"

6) There will be 3 files titled "gta4Browser.exe", "gtaEncoder.exe", and "GTAIV.exe"

7) (DO THIS STEP FOR ALL 3 FILES) Right click the file. Click properties. Then on Comatibility. Now check the box that says "Run this program in compatibility mode for:" Next click on the drop down box and select "Windows Vista Service Pack 2". Hit apply.

8) Run GTA4

9) When you get in the game, a window will pop up for windows live. Just click on create a new profile, scroll down and click the blue text that says create a local profile (or something like that).

10) Make the profile, then close the window.

11) GTA4 Now works on windows 10.
Good game, [strike]Bad port.

- nomemrestrict
- norestrictions
- availablevidmem [VRAM][/strike]

EDIT: You can remove GFWL by using xlive less.dll just put it in the game folder.
"http://gtaforums.com/topic/388658-relgtaiv-xlive less/"

Remove space between xlive and less

EDIT2 : Rockstar added a patch which fixed most of the problems. It's now a good game and a good port. You still need Xlive less though since the game still requires GFWL.
Awful port? Yep. Still to this day? Yep. Thankfully with some mods you can get this game running the way it should(for the most part) with all music, Episodes integrated*, and general visual and performance improvement.

Despite the hicups on PC, IV is still one of my favorite GTA games with it's take on Liberty City, amazing OST, and stories.

**Wouldn't recommend mixing up the integration of episodes with the patches, has cause some hicups when play GTAIV with everything.

[b][i]"WHEN THE WAR CAME, I DID BAD THINGS, BUT AFTER THE WAR I THOUGHT NOTHING OF DOING BAD THINGS. I KILLED PEOPLE, SMUGGLED PEOPLE, SOLD PEOPLE."[/i][/b]

Everybody was looking forward to 3rd December 2008. The release day of PC version of Grand Theft Auto IV. 2 years later, I found out that some GTA IV exists, when I saw "Move Up Ladies" trailer. Back in 2010 I used to run on Windows XP Service Pack 1. I had to upgrade. SP3 was needed. I never upgraded, and when I did month before to W7 I ruined that. I can't exactly remember how it all went down, but all I remember is, that mother cooked me soup, and while the computer was installing Service Pack 3, I was inpatiently waiting in the kitchen eating that bomb soup. Full of excitement I came to my room and that glorious legendary Windows XP background was shining at me and I immidiately started screaming "OH YES OH YES OH YEEEEEEES". 
After that, there was absolute silence in my room for a week. Why? Because I was playing Grand Theft Auto IV.

Now, we all know that it's legendary and before GTA V it was totem to most of the gamers who managed to run it. That optimalization was and is problem to lot of gamers, but it all was a price of the revolution. Maybe, I didn't say it correctly, because [b]revolution is change of something and after that it follows. But no game was able to follow GTA IV.[/b]

Physics was totally heaven. It was like from another planet. Just imagine, 9 freaking years ago, game like GTA IV was out. That game didn't even had competition. Still I'm not sure if there's game close to that physics that we were introduced to back in 2008. Yeah I know GTA V bla bla bla bla. Sound, graphics, story, visuals, city, just every everything was new level. 

Storytelling and dialogues are gripping as hell. It's really deep and intense, with absolute dedication to detail. Liberty City is dark and so is story. Liberty City is beautiful, sad, sombrely. New York in your hands. Everybody has to play it at least once, so I believe there's no need of going into the story, and if so, I'll just tell you to play it because you won't regret it.

Recent update helped a game a bit, but modders used to downgrade. Mods extend the gaming experience. Game will last you easily around 30 hours. It's highly replayable. I can't even count how many times I've finished that. Easily over 10 times. Multiplayer was and is just a bonus addition. Nothing big, nothing real. GFWL sucks, everybody agrees with that. 

Game expansions have been already reviewed so you can check it in my profile. If I forget about anything, let me know please. To sum it up - legendary game that everybody must finish with amazing story and storytelling, awesome visual and physics and great overal gaming experience. 

[b]Bonus Point: Soup from my mother[/b]
[h1]Rating: 9.5/10[/h1]
The game does work on a windows 10 if you install it with steam then disable the paul.dll file in the directory, and you have to log in on the xbox app already installed with windows 10 from there you can launch it. Unfortunately the game cannot be launched through steam anymore. (This was later fixed in the 1.0.8.0 Patch by rockstar)
The game: 
Pros
- good graphics ( everything on max of course)
- magnificent story 
- brings back the nostalgia from playing it on the ps3 
- get the dlc 
Cons 
- none
This review was written while I was taking a dump.
Please note: The game does not work out of the box but the fix is simple. I have written a detailed guide on how to make the game work here: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=768220278

Review:

The game isn't as pretty as a game like GTA V, but remember this game came out on Xbox 360 in 2008. For the age, the graphics work well. If the graphics bother you, there are a plethora of mods available to up the graphics on various sites.

As with every GTA game, there is a lot of things to do in GTA IV. If you count for 100% completion, here's the breakdown:

60%: the 90 story missions
2%: assassinations
2%: street races
2%: Chop shop collections
2%: Car thefts
2%: Drug deliveries
2.5%: Vigilante missions
2.5%: Police Most Wanted hitman missions
5%: Random Encounters
5%: Activities
5%: Special Activities
5%: Competitions
2.5%: Pigeon Hunter
2.5%: Stunt Jumps
(Source: [url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/933037-grand-theft-auto-iv/43592690]GameFaqs[/url])

I played this on 360 when it came out and I averaged about 90 hours by taking my time with the main story. I'd estimate 20-40 hours of additional content remains not counting story missions depending on your skill and time invested.

Overall, the game can be fun. The initial setup issues are what cause 99% of the negative reviews on Steam. Social Club also does not work as of September 2016 when I write this post, so just ignore the login prompt for it on launch. However this also means that the multiplayer aspect is sadly inaccessible. Rockstar made a post on their support forums saying they were looking into it on 6 Oct. 2015 (Source: [url=https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200145226--Updated-5-18-16-Problems-logging-into-Social-Club-to-launch-GTAIV-for-PC]Rockstar Support[/url]) so it's likely that it will never be fixed as it currently looks.

Still, if you never played the single-player, that's completely working. Several of the characters from GTAV are in GTAIV and further expands on their original context in the series here.

If you have any additional questions or concerns before buying the game that I have not answered here in my review, please leave a comment and I will append my review with the answer to your question.
EDIT TO MY OLD POST DOWN BELOW

Video Version of Fix

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZImWyY9UjD4&t=1s

HOW TO PLAY IN MAX SETTINGS WITHOUT GRAPHICAL ERRORS

I figured out how to play with max settings and have no graphical errors.

1. The first thing that you are gonna wanna do is check how much vram you graphics card has if you have atleast 2gigs of vram you should be able to play on max settings if you have anything lower then 2gigs your card is most likely not good enough to play the game in max settings anyway.

2. Once you figure out how much vram your card has you want to open up your steam library find grandtheft auto 4 right click it and open up properties this should pull up a tab that has a button that says set launch options click that and type in these commands.

-nomemrestrict -norestrictions -availablevidmem what ever you vram amount is 

My commands would look like this -nomemrestrict -norestrictions -availablevidmem 8000.0 because my card has 8 gigs of vram IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT YOU PUT THE .0 AFTER THE NUMBER.

3. Then click ok and then launch the game and you should be able to turn the graphics ssettings to max without seeing through the map or having any other big graphical errors i have noticed a little texture popping here and there but i think that just might be a gta problem and not a you problem.


If this does not work for you use the other fix down below it should work for most people

OLD FIX
 
If you are having problems with floating textures or being able to see through the map and want to play on max settings set you graphical settings to

Resolution - whatever you want
Texture Quaiilty - High 
Reflection Quaility Very High
Shadow Quailty - High
Night Shadows - Very High
Texture Filter - X16
View Distance - 25 
Detail Distance - 31
vehicle Density - 100
Definition - On
Vsync - What Ever you want. This caps your frames to whatever your refresh rate is to get rid of screen tearing

Having Shadow Quaility on very high caused the problem with being able to see through the map and floating textures.

Having any value over 25 and 31 for Detail Distance and View Distance will cause rendering issues. Objects will pop in and out in the distance and wont load properly.

Im really excited to finally play this game without graphical problems. Hopes this helps someone else with the same problems that i had.

    [/tr]
    [tr]
        [td][list]
    [*]Noteworthy voice acting
    [*]Realism and care for the details
    [*]Praiseworthy radio stations
    [*]Well written plot
    [*]Balanced missions
    [*]Longevity without compromises
[/list][/td]
        [td][list]
    [*]Some not negligible imperfections
[/list][/td][/tr][/table]

[table][tr][th][h1]Explanation[/h1][/th][/tr]
[tr] 
[td][h1]Pros:[/h1][/td]
[/tr]
    [tr]
        [td][list]
    [*]In this chapter as well the voice acting confirms its excellence not only about the main characters’ voices, but also all the other ones’.
    [*]There are a lot of examples that show a noteworthy care for the details and a sense of realism that have been put in this game (I will mention only some of them, because they are really numerous): physics of every vehicle in general, pedestrians’ reactions, car passengers’ physics, main and secondary characters’ reactions based on the choices made by the player, presence of special vehicles during night (such as the street-cleaning service with operators on it), cloud made by the breath when it’s cold outside, smart overtaking by the cars if the street is blocked by the player, et cetera. 
    [*]We keep having excellent radio stations with a clear improvement both in quality and in quantity. In fact, the overall quantity and the duration of them are superior if compared to the previous chapters.
    [*]The plot is definitely “wider”. There are a lot of missions whose quantity is similar to the one of “Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas”, and they introduce the player to a definitely larger number of important characters.
    [*]The missions have been designed in a better way than before, because their difficulty increases in a gradual and balanced way, allowing the player to learn the fundamental controls and generally have fun without forcing him / her to face prematurely exaggerated difficulties.
    [*]The game has a noteworthy longevity and grants a constant entertainment level (40 gameplay hours versus the 30 of “Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas”, and in both cases I didn’t do any secondary mission).
[/list][/td][/tr]
[tr]
[td][h1]Cons:[/h1][/td]
[/tr]
[tr]
        [td][list]
    [*]The game has few but not negligible imperfections: in some cutscenes there’s a clear frames-per-second drop as well as an irregular stuttering of the characters’ movements. These events happened on a machine that can easily run the game smoothly beyond the 60 frames-per-second. The artificial intelligence has still some flaws (for example, in some missions where a gunfight was required to happen, the allies sometimes exposed themselves to the enemy fire without even caring to find a cover, causing in this way several time the mission to fail). At last but not least, it’s not possible to save between one mission and another if they are bond due to plot’s reasons.
[/list][/td][/tr][/table]
[table][tr][th][h1]Additional considerations:[/h1][/th][/tr]
[tr]
        [td][list]
    [*]I personally appreciated a lot the benchmark tool because it was very precise at finding an excellent compromise between quality and performance. 
    [*]A lot of players complained about Games For Windows Live. About me, all I had to do was going on the official GTA forum, following the guide’s steps to create an offline profile, and play. It didn’t require more than 5 minutes. I haven’t played online because I wasn’t interested to it, so I do not know if the online functionalities work as they should.
    [*]The fighting mechanics have been completely changed and became definitely more realistic. It can be hard at the start to learn, but once you get used to it, its benefits appear quite clearly, especially the aiming system that has been finally improved and made comfortable for keyboard and mouse players. 
    [*]The artificial intelligence has generally been definitely improved in every kind of possible behaviour.
    [*]Even if they are few - very few (four, max five), there are some not violent, but very, very cruel scenes. I warned you.
[/list][/td][/tr][/table]
[table][tr][th][h1]Final considerations:[/h1][/th][/tr]
[tr][td] I think it’s definitely a well-grounded title and that, despite from the appearences, it can teach a lot on many important topics. It was truly a great experience for me, and I definitely suggest this game to anyone who likes the genre: I am definitely sure you will be satisfied. [/td][/tr][/table]

I love gta 4 I used to play gta 4 on a xbox 360 but i like it more on pc but their is one problem. 

Guide to fix the problem
--------------------------
Step 1: Download xbox live less for what ever vesion of the game that you have

{{Short version: There are hoops to jump through at first, but GTA IV is worth the money and the 10-15 minutes it takes to set the game up to play.}}

I write this review understanding that this isn't a brand new game, and as such, this review is for people who, like me, are buying this game waaaay after it's prime. Why am I writing this review? Because I nearly found myself dissuaded out of a perfectly good game by reviews that targeted easily bypassed issues.

Now, I'd like to begin this by saying that no matter what platform you play it on, GTA IV is still a good game, and a fun entry to the GTA series. A lot of the other reviews for this game note that there's difficulty getting this game to work on PC, and, I won't lie, it's true; there are some hoops to jump through to get this game working. These reviews, however, vastly overstate the difficulty of playing this game, and as such, advise against it's purchase, but don't heed these reviews, the process of getting this game to work takes 10 minutes, 15 tops. Combined with the time it takes to download in the first place, this is totally negligible. 

Down to it: 
There are two main barriers to pass before enjoying going bowling with your virtual cousin, Games for WIndows Live, and Social Club, both of which can be gotten around very easily. In the effort to not make this review a tutorial, I will simply say that there exist plenty of dedicated tutorials on the web, especially on support forums and the like.

At the end of the day, what you get is a great GTA game, with all of GTA's signature crazy storytelling. I've heard tell that there's a way to still access multiplayer too, and there are plenty of people who have done this. It's the same story here, you have to put a little work in, but then you have a perfectly good game.
2nd best Grand Theft Auto in my opinion, before Vice City. (yes I know, SA is a very close third)

Pros

+Fantastic story
+Mature tone
+Well-written characters, specifically Niko
+Immersive, detiled game world
+Great second part
+Small details put into map
+Soundtrack
+The antagonist
+Cover system
+A.I.
+Ragdoll physics
+Realistic physics engine and driving 
+Dark, Gritty tone in the overall game

Cons

+Games for Windows Live
+Recent loss of mod support
+Poor optimization
+Slightly repetitive missions
+Below par 1st act
+Aimed mostly only for mature, story focused gamers
+Toned-down customization options
+Character inconsistencies in Niko
+While friendships help flesh out characters, they can be somewhat annoying

TL:DR, Even with it's flaws, Grand Theft Auto IV is an extremely solid game, and is better than Grand Theft Auto V in my own personal opinion. I recommend it for mature gamers that prioritize story over gameplay and not ridiculous things such as an empty map, three empty caricatures for protagonists, or a story trying too hard to entertain like a certain overrated sandbox game I know. 

Then again, that's just my own silly personal opinion.

*Edit 1: Grand Theft Auto IV was recently updated, effectively shutting down multiplayer.

*Edit 2: OpenIV (a popular modding tool used for GTA IV and V) was recently shut down by Take-Two following a cease and desist. DO NOT buy this or Grand Theft Auto V for mods.

*Edit 3: Nomintated for "Mom's Spaghetti" Award for Steam Awards 2017. It's that mesmerizing.
[h1][b][u]Aspects of Grand Theft Auto IV Worth Praising[/u][/b][/h1]

● [b]Independent FM.[/b] As with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, you have your very own customizable radio station to play your own music while exploring Liberty City.

● [b]The Video Editor.[/b] Unfortunately not many developers provide their players with a tool such as the Video Editor, this tool allows you have seemingly endless opportunities for creating videos and screenshots.

● [b]No Weapon Use Restrictions.[/b] Unlike its successor Grand Theft Auto V, Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't restrict the use of your weapons while inside your safehouses or whether you're in a store. Hence, allowing you to shoot anything and everything inside your home as you desire or use it as refuge from the police.

● [b] Forward Thinking Online Modification Ideology.[/b] Regardless of your view on Games for Windows Live, the online aspect of Grand Theft Auto IV doesn't ban users for using modifications but instead segregates those who have modified game files unlike its successor, Grand Theft Auto V. Whenever you would like to rejoin regular sessions, simply remove the modified files, replace the original ones or reinstall the game.

[h1][b][u]Aspects of Grand Theft Auto IV Worth Criticizing[/u][/b][/h1]

● [b]Optimization.[/b] Regardless of your hardware specifications or how much you've spent on it, you're going to experience 30 frames per second frame drops while driving at high speeds.


[h1][b][u]Deplorable Digital Rights Management Restrictions[/u][/b][/h1]

● [b]Rockstar Social Club.[/b] Without signing into the Rockstar Social Club you can't play online or track your statistics on the Social Club. If you want to remove it, simply remove the paul.dll.

● [b]Games for Windows Live.[/b] Without a Live account or offline local account you can't save your [i]single player[/i] progress. You can easily get around this disgrace by installing a modified version of the xlive.dll. I've linked it below if you would like a purely offline uninterrupted experience.

● [b]SecuROM.[/b] This revolting abomination limits your installations of Grand Theft Auto IV to [u]15[/u]. If you frequently change your PC or replace most of your PCs parts, your access to Grand Theft Auto IV will be terminated. Those who pirate this product don't have to worry about limited installations.

Some consumers don't care about their rights for the products they purchase but most of these services treat consumers worse than pirates. Dispite of the stomach-churning digital rights managment restrictions, I recommend Grand Theft Auto IV [i][b]if the price is right.[/b][/i]

I legit don't understand how so many people are having issues with the game. I did a quick google search, got patches and everything needed and even found an updated scripthook with ease. The game is still very playable if you know how to move files around.

8/10 Would rather be in 2008 again.
[h1] I remember that time, when i was 14 and always wanted a XBOX 360 just to play the newest GTA Game. [/h1]

This is without a doubt one of the best single player games of all time, and it is even more of a certainty that it features one of the ultimate video game story-lines, i mean... its GTA... The plot is so engaging, the characters instantly likeable, and the cutscenes are anything but boring.

Some have mourned the loss of the arcade feel of previous games in the series, but this is stupid; yes, it is a sensationally fun game. You can't have honestly played this game and not have marvelled and spent hours pushing the limits of the ridiculous physics of the game world. 

It runs on Ultra graphical settings with no lag or other problems. If you don't have a powerful enough P.C, as I did for a long time, don't be quick to down this game. Seriously, save for an upgrade as this game is worth it. Rockstar admittedly however made a terrible decision to integrate with Windows Live, and the unavoidable Social Club. Hopefully in time these services will improve or be phased out because at the moment they are a pointless obstacle, detracting from what is otherwise a masterpiece. 

I dunno what all the problems were that people were having with Games for Windows Live or Rockstar Social Club, but I didn't hit any major hurdles getting this game up and running.
A file exists to remove GFWL and fix many issues people have. Download x live less and put in your GTA IV folder to remove the DRM. 

Otherwise great game, just a pain in the butt to get working.
This Will no longer be be a thing as Rockstar Just updated it and made it Windows 10, and 8 Compatibale with GTA IV

Making this game work for me took me more 5 minutes to work, I dont know why so many People are complaining About the game not working! It's Really easy! Follow These steps Please to make it Run!!!!

And Done GTA IV (One Of the Best games Ever) Now works I hoped This worked!
GTA IV is not bad game as many would say, it was just bad port at the end, yet it has little to no bugs (no bugs or issues experienced so far), and performance is good, as long as you don't overreact with settings. GTA 4 is first Rockstar's game that includes their new game engine (RAGE), and it presents distinctive design and mechanics. I bought this game on sale (and EFLC as well) , and despite bad reviews from community, i did not regret this purchase. I'm currently playing it to the end, and so far i love it, especially Niko's serbian lines (i am not a Serb). 

If you want to buy this game, go for it. Ignore negative reviews, jer oni su slabići u svakom slučaju.
If i dont look on optimalization... 

Then this gta is best gta ever! 

So much simulation in the game: Human body when shooting or street fighting, cars, boats, motobikes and so on

I miss this in GTA V.
Let me just start off by saying that Grand Theft Auto IV is the BEST GTA GAME EVER!

GTA IV is a thousand times better than GTA V. I don't care about those graphics, the details, or the online features of GTA V, the gameplay and storyline of GTA IV will always remain the best. This game has the most beautiful production of all the games in the series. The characters are brilliantly executed, the environment and feel of the game is so realistic. (Don't mind the AI or the other GTA-like features) and the game makes you feel so elevated. Then why are there so many negative reviews?

If you are reading this anytime in the 2019+, this game has mixed reviews (at least since 2013). And let me tell you why:

Up till now, my review has only been restricted to the game-play, but let's talk about the way this port was implemented for the PC. First of all, the port uses the age old GFWL DRM. And it doesn't work. That's it. It just doesn't work anymore.

The next thing is that this game is 32-bit, and uses only up-to 4 GB of memory. So, any hardware above a mid-range laptop will run the game exactly the same. Even if you have a 2080 Ti or a monster rig, it will run only as good.

BUT, even if it [i]DOES[/i] run well, there are chances of the game crashing and being buggy, because if the cut-scenes reach 60 FPS, everything will be zoomed in like looking through a magnifying glass. And it is irritating and may crash the game too!

Not only that, the part that hit me the most is the way the expansion packs (or DLCs) have been implemented. Unlike the regular GFWL version, the DLCs come as a separate game, making the integration with GTA IV impossible. Which means no synced save files, no extra radio stations and no smooth transitions. This (personally) made me very mad.

Then, to top it all, they (Rockstar) disable custom mods in the latest update, version 1.0.8.0 of the game.

There are also many in-game bugs and optimization failures that you may notice once you start playing it, but nonetheless, if you haven't played the game before, disregard everything I just said above and play it. There have been some fixes released and the game can be playable, but, for me, it ran pretty smooth (I own a very low-end rig, so no complains). And play it before there are too many technological advances your hardware can support it no more.

Let me just end by saying this: Don't miss this game for the world. All that I found missing in GTA V, I found in this game. I did play GTA IV a long time ago, but only after playing GTA V, I realized it's value.

Thank you.
"Why won't you show me around the city?" "Fucking terrorists."

Pros:
-Great story
-Good gameplay
-Decent Graphics
-Soundtrack is good

Cons:
-Optimization
-Some missions were absolutely boring as all hell
I strongly recommend that Rockstar Games should remove [strike][b]Games for Windows Live[/b][/strike] in Grand Theft Auto IV, and add [b]STEAM ACHIEVEMENTS[/b] to it. Just like [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/21690/]Resident Evil 5[/url] and [url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/321040/]DiRT 3[/url]. They are really good examples.We GTA fans would appreciate that if it could happen some day.
[h1]In short, is the game good?[/h1]
Yes, great story

[h1]Is it worth my time and money?[/h1]
Worth your time?
Yes
Money?
No
I personally think 20$ is overpriced just wait for a sale or something.

[h1]Linear,open-world or something else?[/h1] 
Just a simple big open world city (New York) to explore with hidden weapon, collectibles (for 100% game) etc.

[h1]Gameplay mechanics, gimmicks?[/h1]
The gameplay is challenging and intense gun fights. The driving is set with a realistic vehicle handling.

[h1]Graphical aesthetics, set pieces and world design?[/h1] 
Tbh the graphics is good for being 2008 but comparing with gta v (2015 Pc Version) graphics these graphics is kinda depressing and dark sometimes.

[h1]Audio design and soundtrack?[/h1] 
Audio is high quality and the soundtracks in game is great. But sometime for me when you get a call from someone it bruses then it stops. (But maybe thats only me)

[h1]Plot,story?[/h1]
The story is great even today. [spoiler]Niko Bellic, an Eastern European, arrives in Liberty City to meet his cousin Roman, pursue the American Dream, and to search for the man who betrayed his unit in a war fifteen years prior. Upon arrival, however, Niko discovers that Roman's tales of riches and luxury were lies concealing struggles with gambling debts and loan sharks, and that Roman lives in a dirty apartment rather than a mansion.[/spoiler]

[h1]How does the game run?[/h1]
The game runs a little bit weird, the graphics are set to high.
Sometime the frames drop from 60 fps to 50 fps.
Specs:
16gb ram
GTX 1070
I5-6500

[h1]Any details, character, motif, etc. you particulary liked?[/h1]
The internet cafe for missions or side jobs.

[h1]Anything you didn't like?[/h1]
The worst nightmare of them all GFWL (Games For Windows Live) You need to make a GFWL account to play this game with is a pain in the a$$.

[h1]Final score?[/h1]
A great gta story you must try
8.3/10
First of all i want to say that the current patch 1.08 is buggy as hell so if you don't want multiplayer and want to enjoy sp and modding, downgrade to patch 1.07 or patch 1.04

So than the 
pros:-
1.Great and strong dark story
2.Great Ai,physics
3.Beautiful Graphics as a 2008 game
4.This game will take 30-40 hours at your first playthrough
5.I love niko really a funny and cool guy
6.The city is living and breathing
7.Mp is alive now
8.There are many cool modes

cons:-
1.The optimization is bad
2.Still there is bug on the final mission i have to lock the fps at 30 to get on the copper
3.This game is not so enjoyable for kids because this game is too serious not so crazy like gta SA and Vice city
4.Many downgrades from gta Sa like Gym,Learning new moves,Driving Planes,Country site,no casino,Not that much vehicles like gta Sa,No rpg elements like gta Sa ,not that much weapons e.t.c
5.And also the boaling with roman.:-P

Still i will recommend to buy this game beacuse it is one of the all time best game and you will definately love this ,if you don't want to play the bad optimized pc port than play it on consoles.
Apart from technical issues, this game is a masterpiece. Phenomenal story, great car physics, well-designed map make this game really addictive. If not bad porting, I'd prefer this game over GTA V.
it's wonderfull <3
Btw, if you've downloaded radios in gta 4 + eflc, especially journey & electrochoc fm..
 Just try to listening these radio while driving, but I suggest while motorized.
 [b]just try it~ [/b]you will feel an extraordinary sensation.

anyway, this game is very fantastic by deep & lot of possilibities in the story. Sometimes,I think half an hour to decide on actions in each mission. it's not like any other game, this game's really based things and their culture in 2008.
but hell, i love the physic engine too~

[i]you won't regret to buy it buddy[/i]
Maybe I'm just lucky, but it only took me a good couple minutes of searching online to figure out how to get the game working and remove the graphical restrictions, so I wouldn't let the comments about being unable to boot the game discourage you from buying the game. Even if somehow you can't get the game to work no matter how hard you looked or how many methods you've tried, there's always the refund option, so it wouldn't hurt to try.

The game is actually quite functional. I have yet to experience any crashes even after hours of continuous play and stuttering rarely happens.

People love to talk about how bad the driving in this game is. I'll say that it just takes getting used to. For sure, when I first took Roman back to the apartment, I thought the driving was extremely difficult to control. Hours in and I can control my driving just fine. It might take a lot more braking and speed control than many would like, but learning to control the cars in this game isn't too bad.

The only annoying issue that I have with this game is the awkward "deadzone" for aiming. If you move the mouse too slowly while aiming, like trying to accurately pop somebody's head but your crosshair is a couple millimeters away from that sweet shot, then the crosshair will not move at all, but instead wait for a faster mouse movement in order to move. I often find myself in situations where my crosshair is close, but not dead on, so I have to flick the crosshair away from my target and flick back onto him to take my shot. There's probably easier ways to point and shoot, but I'll have to figure that out later.
This has tons of mixed reviews.

Pros:
One of the better stories in the GTA series
Graphics are nice and atmosphereic
Weapons are fun and it's better than the older games to go on shootouts
Cheats are way more accessible than the previous games, and in the latest GTA
Cars from GTA SA are updated and look more like the cars they were based off of

Cons:
Not much clothes variety
Driving is like Disney Princesses on ice
Limited Ammo with weapons
Taking any sort of damage, being pushed lightly, hitting the wrong thing, or falling slightly can get rid of the cheat menu in an instant
Less unique vehicles, more generic cars
Sometimes confusing mission objectives and overall confusing map

It may seem like more cons than pros, but it's up to you. For me, the pros outweigh the cons and this game is one of my favorites in the series with Vice City. All in all, this game is up to the player, not just me.

TL;DR - Buy it, play it yourself. If it sucks or doesn't work tweak the experience/game or refund.
YOU STILL CAN SAVE IN THIS GAME!!

  You have to open Games for Windows Live in GTA once you've started it. Choose "create an account", and then you should find "create a local profile". Choose this and complete what is asked. When it's done, you'll be " connected " in offline, and it is reconnecting you everytime you launch the game. With that you can save your game as normal.

Found the solution in the Rockstar site. Thanks Windumb, like always.
Don't have a look at the negative reviews cuz they are only about the installation problems. According to me , it wasn't difficult to install and play the game. 

Also , you should purchase GTA IV cuz of its storyline.
This game is awsome !

Pros :
+ Perfect story and storyline
+ Nice graphic and visual content
+ Nice Destruction simulating ( Better than GTA V :| )
And 
+ Nice charecter designing ! I really love niko and his cousin :D

Cons :
There are not many cons in this game but
+ Some gameplay issues like Coverin , aiming and both of them at same time is some times annoying which as long as this game is from previous generation i don't consider it .

So defenitly Try this game ! :D
Recently started replaying this game and by heck what a difference the hardware makes to it.

When initially released this game was a P. I. T. A. to run, nevermind to get decent performance out of it. On my current build I am able to max the game out at 4k hitting a consistent 60fps with very little frame drops. And I have to say playing it like this has given me a fresh view of a game I couldn't stand playing on the 360 due to technical limitations (sub 30fpd/awful textures ect.)

Clearly from playing with modern hardware this game was made well before it's time. It looks fantastic at higher resolutions and does not look out of place in this generations games, and in some ways with the realistic graphic style it looks better than 5. When playing at 60fps the gameplay feels fluid and cars handle better and overall everything feels more responsive compared to the original launch.

If you hated 4 like myself for how it played I sincerely recommend that you give it another chance on modern hardware
For me, it's undoubtedly the best GTA game in the series, and now, 
after 10 years of playing it on different platforms, I finally took the time to buy it on Steam.

The story is not what I would've previously expected from a Grand Theft Auto game. It's dark, witty and left me hooked for weeks, and after I'm done playing, I still come back from time to time.

Liberty City might not be the largest map in the series, but it's attention to detail at the time of release is outstanding. For those who expect a more laid-back and easy-going GTA game, I'd rather point them towards GTA V, but for those who like a bit more serious approach with the occasional well-known sarcasm from Rockstar, you'll like this.
The last time I played this game was in 2009 on the PS3. That time I did not have a steam account nor good computer. When I finally decided that I needed to play the game since I played every GTA game including GTA 1 and GTA 2, i knew GTA 4, TLAD and TBOGT were the final ones. So I bought this game and completed it. In my opinion, it was a amazing and WAY BETTER than GTA 5 and it's storyline nonsense. The storyline and ending was dramatic and very strong. The driving was nice and is still a good game after 10 years. I love it!
The Best GTA After San Andreas! Damn I love the atmosphere in this game so much, the crash psychics, the cars, the soundtrack, the story. This game was sooo ahead of it's time! This title is a crusher to other games of the same genre, and if you like GTA this should be in your collection as soon as possible
Well, without these bugs, incompabilities with Windows 10, GTA IV's a good game.
By the way Rockstar, if you had the f--king time to send a patch that delete all the songs that have copyright issues, why can't you send some patch to fix and update your recent released games' experience, just let players buy some good-looking trash to fill their steam library? Steam's a game platform, not a already-owned-game counting simulator.
姗姗来迟的补评：[h1]gta4真的是划时代的巨作，不是吹的……不论剧本、游戏性、物理效果、人物形象、细节重现都已经达到了前所未有的极致。（before gta5）

Gta4 is really an epoch-making masterpiece . It's not exaggerated ... No matter the script ,  gameplay ,  physical effects ,  characters , rendition of fine detail,  has reached an unprecedented extreme.[/h1]
Overall a good game. Just one gripe, has a bug in the last mission that hasn't been fixed up to this day.
Had to do this to finish the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnw1SAMlUrU
Grand Theft Auto IV is a classic title that still holds up in many departments, but feels lackluster in others compared to today's standards. In terms of story and characters, this is my favorite Rockstar title in that aspect. You really relate to the characters, you fear for them, they're funny but slip in enough drama, and they all interact with each other excellently. The open world is also a great achievement in this series. The dirty, ugly New York parody known as Liberty City is far more engaging than other titles, and it still feels real enough to work. The way the world interacts with the player really sells this as a functioning world.

The missions get a bit repetitive, and like other Rockstar games, it sometimes feels like there's too many characters to keep track of later in the game, and it has a finale that doesn't feel entirely special from a gameplay standpoint. The gameplay is also a bit clunkier than other games compared to today. The cars behave more "realistically" and less arcade-like such as Grand Theft Auto V, as well as some weapons. It feels a bit like some fun was sacrificed for realism, but not enough to make me stop playing, I still enjoyed it. The graphics haven't aged all that well either. Some aspects still look pretty decent, but some of the character models and closeups definitely reek of the time, but that's easy to get past.

The multiplayer mode used to be some of the most fun you could have online at the time. Your experience wasn't a necessary grind and not everybody was a tryhard jerk like in Grand Theft Auto V. However, it is hard to find enough players that you used to be able to years ago. It is a sad loss and that era has passed, so if you haven't played that, it does feel like you missed out.

I highly recommend Grand Theft Auto IV for the story and tone. It feels refreshing compared to Rockstar's other unrestrained titles, but I understand if that holds it back for you. If you can afford it, I recommend checking it out.
This game is WORTH IT, all the way. Everything about it is great (except for that fucking windows live interface), the story, the soundtrack, the map, characters, guns, cars, EVERYTHING. Just buy it already :)
Albeit the missions are repetitive, the checkpoint system  is excruciating and the game sometimes shows it's age, the excellent writing, characters and most of all, the radio, make Liberty City a world worth inhabiting for 30+ hours.
Graphics are still look amazing. The atmosphere is incredible. Driving is ok-ish. I really like that the cars have realistic suspension and driving but sometimes it just gets in your way during missions. Motorcycles are absolute shit. It feels like you're driving on ice. Story is pretty ok but nothing extraordinary. Missions are mostly the same thing. The ending is kind of bland since i thought i was only approaching the last third of the story. However the intro is absolutely fucking amazing. It really puts you into the mood to play a dark menacing game. The most annoying part of the game takes place outside the game. It took me hours to setup gta4 to play normally. I had to follow a bunch of guides. Lastly, the shooting mechanics are horrible. For some reason your aiming sometimes gets stuck on a horizontal or vertical line. Its pretty annoying. I asked my friend and he also said that this happens.

Verdict: Despite it's flaws its still a nice game. Buy it on sale and check it out for yourself. Just don't expect a 98/100 rated game.
(Edit Sep 19 - I have fixed the problem. But I'm still going to leave this review to warn others ot the negative experiences I had with this game, the amount of things I had to do should not have been necessary. Check the comments for the explanation on what I did to make it work)

On 2 seperate Nights, I spent several hours trying a multitude of fixes,  No matter how many guides,  changes,  and videos with awful music.  Everything ended up with the error 2000 from the Securom.  which is apparentley an extremely common problem, with 10001 possible fixes.

After 2 hours on the second night, I realized, I'm wasting my time,  I had my fun with the game years ago,  I shouldn't even bother trying to spend any more time with a product from a company that gives so few fks about .. really anything but money in GTA Online.

They did release a patch in 2018 but it doesn't fix anytihng.  the game has THREE LAYERS OF DRM and they all require the stars to align and all be on the right versions, for the right operating system, with the right windows configuration,  and the right .dlls and other files. I have never seen a AAA game this much of a coded mess that it just cannot work even with a power user working on it.

Rockstar, just a bunch of Cokehead shyster developers can update a game to take out music that their licenses expired on, but they can't update their games to work on modern windows 10, nor detatch it from the depricated useless GFWL program. 


really giving EA a run for it's money in the scumbag c*nt award
This game gets a thumbs down because it doesn't work without doing extra work. And Rockstar is aware of these issues but won't produce a patch. Otherwise GTA IV is awesome.

To get the game to run if you are on Windows 8.1 (and maybe lower) you need to download and install the latest Games For Windows Live.  Yes GFWL is cancer but it is required. Just Google it and hope the download link is still up. (It is retarded you need this considering GFWL is DEAD and no longer supported.)

Then if you have a video card above 2 gigs you need to do two things to ensure it runs properly. GTA IV assumes you do not meet the requirements and limits your graphics settings. To get around this make a file in the GTA IV install folder called "commandline.txt" without the qoutes. Then put "-nomemrestrict -norestrictions" without the qoutes inside of the file and save. Then goto your Steam launch settings for the game and put those two settngs in there like the you did the file.

You are welcome. Where are my support royalties Rockstar?
The Game won't let you save or load anymore because "Games for Windows Live" doesn't seem to be supported any longer...
Also Rockstar took the liberty of removing quite a bunch of beloved songs from the outstanding soundtrack because they must have thought that they are too poor for renewing a few licenses... I feel kind of robbed and can't recommend this game in this state to anyone anymore!!!!!! F. Rockstar...
[h1][b]GTA IV The Game			* 8/10
GTA IV As a Software		* 0/10[/b][/h1]

Let's stay ojective on this one, I downvoted this title not because I didn't enjoy the game but because I really cannot stand how developers and publishers handled this product, so I've split this review in 2 parts: one for GTA IV As a Software, and the other one as a game itself. 
[list]
[*][b]GTA IV (as a Software)[/b]

BUY this game AT YOUR OWN RISK. Why?
The procedure is the usual, we download and we get a serial key. Fine. Start the game and first thing we have to do is login with a Rockstar Social Club. Which I still believe has no reason to exist, but since this is their game I can live with it... Until their own launcher doesn't let me log in many random times for unknown reasons. Luckily it's necessary for online games only so I skip that passage as I'm not interested. Fine let's play! NO. Now you have to face Games for Windows Live, a dead platform badly working which You need TO MANUALLY UPDATE FIRST, because NOBODY EVER THOUGHT OF DOING IT WHEN THE PLATFORM DIED, then it pretends your login and your serial code. OK, I'm almost running out of patience here but many games on steam require further registration with another platform (uPlay, Origin...), so ok. Then it's mayhem. I've read about A WHOLE LOT of people with this same issue: I've bought a 4-pack so I've registered all my serials on my account and all my friends' except for one which isn't recognized. There's NO WAY to get a solution for this (and I'm NOT even considering the trick where you're supposed to buy Episodes from liberty city to use its serial as GTA IV serial because I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BUY MORE TO USE WHAT I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR). Steam isn't responsible and claims it's rockstar or microsoft issue, Microsoft doesn't even have a number to call as GFWL is dead, Rockstar doesn't care and I've only read of just one user that came out of this by threatening Rockstar of SUING THEM and after a VEEERY long time he got a new serial.
After all these troubles IF we're lucky we can get to the game... Or maybe not. Obviously On modern systems there HAS to be issues as The game allows to change your graphic Details ONLY IF it detects enough VRAM.Too bad that it doesn't recognize anything at all. Luckily A couple of command strings SHOULD be enough to bypass that problem. Let's press the "Play" button... Loading...Loading...Loading... REALLY?!?!? Luckily seems like another command strings solve that problem as well, but it's really ridiculous considering all the money they got they didn't support nor fixed any of these problems.

[*][b]GTA IV (as a Game)[/b]

Anyways, after a good dose of patience and luck, once inside the game it gives some satisfaction. I've played the whole franchise since the first GTA (except for london) so I've seen the evolution of the games and I have to say this chapter is a huge leap forward.
The gameplay is basically the same, third person action, you can do almost anything you want but if you want to follow the story and the missions it can be summarized as Running, shooting, stealing cars and drive away. In this chapter the gameplay introduces the cover systems which kind of helps in difficult situations and shootings. What makes the game particular is the really big map, a lively city with so many things to do, which means huge replayability. Liberty City is split in various "islands" connected with bridges... Closed at the beginning, as usual and there are the usual stores, spray'n'go, weapons and so on. Besides that there are also reastaurants, fast food, clothes shops and similar, among with the new leisure activities, such as bowling, strip clubs, cabaret and whatever, used mainly to maintain your reputation with friends and girlfriends. Yes, you can choose to date girls, and go out with friends which will call you anytime on your ingame mobile to invite you somewhere, and wether you accept or not it will influence the "level of friendship", which is kind of important as once you reach the top level they can help you out with their own abilities (call a cab, car bombs, weapons and more). Important or not it can be kind of annoying as girlfriends will always look at your clothes which you must change often and choose carefully according to their taste, and friends will often call to invite you... quite often... At any time... even while you're on mission or already out with someone else...
Anyways, Looks like Rockstar did a really good job with the story as well, which was to be expected, but now they've taken everything to the next level with their new graphic engine with good direction skills and by taking good shots. You also have to make a choice towards the end and this will lead to two very different endings. [spoiler]And they're both quite bitter if I may say [/spoiler]but I really liked the story anyways.
The new engine does its job and shows the beauties of liberty city. Of course sometimes there are the usual glitches where some map elements are loaded later, or maybe sometimes the game will show on the road only massive copies of your own car but besides that everything is ok.
There are few new things I really liked, such as buildings in the city... Meaning you can get inside various buildings, so this time you don't have a city made of impenetrable cubes. Of course most of them are accessible during missions but it gave a nice variation to the gameplay and locations. There's a TON of radio stations, and I love all of them, just like in the previous games, of course. And last thing is something I kind of liked and hated at the same time: the "police wanted system". Once you get the police attention you have to get out of an area of interest whose limits are determined by nearby units that have you onsight. Which is good... And hard to do at the same time as it's quite hard to shake off the units behind AND avoid the large quantity of units incoming ahead of you, which means they will keep you busy with long pursuit sessions before you can shake them off... Especially if you get the attention of choppers.
One last thing that really took me some time to get used to is car physics... I mean, it's kind of hard and odd to drive them. Honestly, I don't care too much if it's more realistic than the older games or GTA V, but I can say all the cars are hard to handle, they don't steer enough, Handbrake makes you totally lose control, but after some hours of game I kind of got used to it... Not without some difficulty anyways. 
[/list]
[h1]---PROs---[/h1][list]
[*][b] GAMEPLAY.[/b] It's GTA, one generation ahead of the trilogy. Many additions and improvements to the game giving you lots of activities to do besides the main campaign.
[*][b] LIBERTY CITY.[/b] A very big city with lots of places, activities, people around, doing things, everything is really lively in that place. And everythin is built with lot of dedication and care for details. Even rides in Trains have a panoramic cinematic, or rides in taxis with lots of dialogues with the driver.
[*][b] STORY.[/b] Story is never to be underestimated in any GTA chapter and this here makes no exception.
[/list]

[h1]---CONs---[/h1][list]
[*][b] SERIAL ACTIVATION.[/b] The biggest flaw with this game is the high chance to fail registering your own Legit Serial Key AND the total lack of assistence. Not to mention the fact that you need to update your Games For Windows Live manually and the Rockstar Social Club randomly doesn't let you log in. THIS is the reason I downvoted this product.
[*][b] COMPATIBILITY ISSUES.[/b] It has some issues with modern hardware and modern OS and there's no official patch for this. Luckily there's always the steam community that helped me run GTA IV on my Laptop with Win 10 x64 and a Integrated nVidia GPU.
[*][b] CARS.[/b] Maybe it's me but I never got used to the car physics, they're quite hard to handle as they never steer enough and you can lose control too easily with handbrake.
[/list]
I bought a physical copy of the game back in 2008. I bought the steam version too because it's much more convenient than having it on DVD.
I'm going to give this one a negative vote because of the following reasons:
[olist]
[*] They should do something about this soundtrack licence problem. I bought the game with all the goddamn tracks in it. I didn't ask for them to be taken away. Just give me my fucking music because that's what I payed for. 
[*] Games for Windows Live. All I want is to download the game and play it. Is that too much to ask? I don't need to register my product in 20 different platforms. GFWL can suck my big hairy balls.
[*] Playing the PC version is like driving an old beat-up car. You're always afraid it's gonna break down.
[/olist]
let me play the game.

Don't make me sign into 5 different accounts with a bunch of passwords for programs that all need to update right now.

Just let me play this game that i paid for, downloaded, and installed.   

Why are you making this such a process?
They can't (or won't) update the game to not include GFWL, a broken mess of a DRM. 
But when it comes to removing content (music), that's no issue. Uninstalled.
Unable to login to Rockstar Social Club
Unable to login to Windows Live Games
Unable to create a so called offline profile
Unable to play single-player
Unable to play multi-player
Unable to change the settings without forcing: -norestrictions

Game unplayable.
Why is this still on the market?
State of the game in 2018:

A horrible PC port bogged down by expired/inactive bloatware like Windows For Games Live and Rockstar Social Club accounts that must be linked to Steam to run.  Only problem is most of these services have long since been taken down, meaning GTA 4 will not even launch for most Windows 10 users.

Also note that Rockstar is planning on removing songs and other content from the game in April 2018 supposedly due to expiring music licenses except this does not just apply to future purchases of the game.  Current/previous users are going to be required to download updates to the game that are going to remove this content from a game they already paid for.
This game was released with a bullshit online authentication system that only hurts legitimate owners of this game, which, while still required, now - as of late 2016 - isn't supported anymore, making the game unplayable in the most literal sense of the word.

Even if you manage to find a workaround for the singleplayer part - which you should not have to do in the first place - multiplayer is permanently inaccessible now that RGSC is dead.

Verdict: Avoid like the plague. If you really want to get it - and I can't believe I am saying this - get it on console instead.
In order to use any online features (which is the only part of the game I am interested in) you must also login to Games for Windows Live (which you need to install yourself), [i]and[/i] Rockstar's Social Club service. This wouldn't be a problem... except for the fact that the social club has not been working in this game for well over a month now. The game has several layers of DRM that simply do not work.
Tons of amazing songs removed and you have to go through so much trouble just to get the game running on Modern day PC's. Come on Rockstar, you update GTA V so much. But you can't help out a GTA IV user enjoy some time? Seriously, you may have removed the songs but please get rid of the BS known as Games for Windows live. It was useless ten years ago and now it's even more useless now. GTA IV is an amazing game, don't get me wrong. But these flaws really hamper what could have been the best version by far.
You're better off finding a PS3 or Xbox 360 copy somewhere out there.
Rockstar at it again: removing songs 10 years after the release because they don't want to pay the licensing. 

Don't forget to preorder GTAVI kids!

I really love this game, it's one of my favorite GTA games, but sadly, I can't recommend this port at all. It's sad that rockstar didn't show any love for this one. Between the struggle to get it to run (Since GFWL, everybody's favorite time waster is a must here), multiplayer being dead, a lot of songs being axed off this port, the bad performance even if your PC is way above the minimum specs, and the rampant bugs here and there,(One which is a game breaker literally IN THE LAST 10 FUCKING MINUTES OF THE GAME), this port is rather crappy. Which is sad, since I would gladly recommend GTA IV.
Sadly i have to give this game a negative review, or, to be more precise, the politics of rockstar around this game. We put up with the ****** social club and windows live. Now, quite a few songs are being scratched. This is very disheartening to see, as we dont know what elso from the game might get the axe. Rockstar should be ashamed of themselves !

Update: A buddy just reminded me: For YEARS Rockstar didnt care about patching the game (Games for Windows live doesnt work? Tough luck, you still have to install it), and the first patch they actually make cripples the game!
Game worked until I updated to Windows 10. Games for Windows Live won't work and it is necessaary to run this game for saves and achievements. Do not recommend buying. Probably will never get fixed.
Garbage and disgrace of Rockstar Games. If you think installing and launching this game is a normal thing like launching other steam games - then you're grave WRONG. Not only this game has serious issues to start on '18 PC gaming rig with Win10 and once you're done with shuffling through threads like "how to run GTA4 in 2018" and wasting your time on applying fixes, the game shows terrible performance and is plagued with stuttering. 
10 years have passed since GTA4 premiere and Rockstar hasn't done anything properly fix the game and adjust to modern day standards. The only thing they did was the removal of large partion of in-grame radio songs. Enough of this. Thumb down.
Ordinarily, when you buy a product, you can do so without fear that the product will be intentionally gutted by its creators later on. Unfortunately, this is exactly how Rockstar operates -- and Steam shoulders some of the blame.

I recently found that an incredible amount of in-game music had been gutted via an update. This came a short time after another patch completely disabled the ability to use a wide variety of mods that had previously improved both the single-player and multi-player experiences. Why prevent players from using mods in a 10 year old game whose remaining online community exists to use said mods? (Note that outside of beta updates, Steam makes no distinction between mandatory and optional updates, and you must manually opt out of automatic updates. Even if automatic updates had been disabled, there would be no way to know that the update was anything but a security or stability patch.) 

I don't care what's in the EULA, and I don't care what's in the fine print [in regards to this issue]. I also don't care what sorts of deals Rockstar initially made with music distributors.  Why? Because a consumer should never have to read the fine print to disabuse themselves of the misleading or outright false language that's in the large print. When I bought this game on Steam, I clicked the "Buy" button. Not the "Rent" button. Not the "Subscribe" button. I reasonably expected to have the rights that come with owning a product. 

I have never before bought a product only to have its creator intentionally damage said product in multiple demonstrable ways well after the purchase was made. In what world is this not tantamount to bait-and-switch of the most egregious order? Class-action, anybody?


With regards to the game itself...

Performance: 
It's a technical mess on PC -- very poorly optimized on any machine if you can even get it to start. Do not expect to sustain 60fps on any graphics setting, regardless of your specs. 

Single-player:
The single-player campaign is eclipsed by most similar open-world games (I personally recommend Sleeping Dogs for a similar but higher-quality campaign). If you think unrealistically gratuitous foul language and half-assed sociopolitical commentary are cool and edgy, you'll appreciate GTA4's story and world.

Multi-player:
The multi-player Free Mode is a blast, and would definitely be good enough to justify the purchase under normal circumstances. Unfortunately, Rockstar's double-layer Social Club / Windows Live online system is thoroughly undependable, and has been broken for months at a time on multiple occasions over the past few years (and who knows how much longer the online servers will be sustained, anyways?). This leaves only LAN play. Given the way things have been going -- disabled mods, removal of large amounts of content -- I would not be surprised to see GTA4's LAN multiplayer removed in future updates, presumably to force any remaining playerbase into the cluster that is GTA5 Online.


TLDR; Rockstar is an egregiously bad, likely legally culpable company. From intentionally damaging consumers' purchased products years after the point of sale (GTA4 and GTA5), to banning multitudes of players from online play with no explanation given (GTA5), you simply shouldn't buy from Rockstar unless you actively enjoy getting ripped off.
10 years
10 FUCKING YEARS AND THEY STILL DIDNT FIX THE FUCKING WINDOW LIVE ISSUE
GTA 4 is a really good game and it can become better but with GFWL still in the game, it just a completely a mess
This game is wonderful, but don't buy it on the PC (EDIT: Do not buy if you have Windows 8). You have to manually configure the game to make it compatible with Windows 8 (if you have it). For some reason, to save your progress you must create a Games for Windows Live account. Which barely matters, seeing you can't start the game without GFWL if you have Windows 8. The only reason I have about 25 hours on this game is me trying to fix it/having it on an old Win 7 PC. I lost a good $20 on this game, don't waste your money.

EDIT: Got a PC with Windows 7. Great game if you have Win7/XP, if not, don't bother buying.
This game is amazing! Really! But I simply cannot recommend this game in it's current state. It is so sad to see rockstar abandon such a beloved game to focus on making money through online on their new releases. They will most likely never patch this game which is quite saddening.
This should not be on sale in the state Rockstar have left it. To shamelessly release an update that removes licensed music content after the license expires(why license for such a short time? Will this also affect newer games from Rockstar?) but then leave the GFWL baggage that Microsoft have abandoned is bad enough. Then they go and update this store page to tell players that it is up to them to work around this broken bloatware in order to be able to simply save and load a game. 

Shabby work, Rockstar.
This game falls under my Rockstar boycott and is now victim of Rockstars typical practises that warrent my boycott.
Owners of the game will have content of the game removed instead of Rockstar releasing a new edition on Steam that does not have the violating music included.

Other issues with the game make it DRM hell with SecuROM, Social Club and worst of all a broken Games for Windows Live making it difficult for you to play the game properly.

My negative review is not only for this product, but as a result of my boycott for all rockstar games.
Do not buy there games under any circumstances unless you can get the game DRM free without forced updates and do not care about the multiplayer platform.

Update: The tracks have now indeed been removed but replaced with an alternative. This was not the case for San Andreas so it still sets a doubtful future president and does not change my opinion of the review itself.
I bought this game so I could have a fun time online with some friends.
...
Guess what.
...
I couldn't go online.

The Social Club login is completely bugged. Every time I enter my credentials an error pops up, and I'm not able to play multiplayer, which sucks. I've looked everywhere for a fix, but so far, I haven't found anything that actually works.
I'm writing this review so that you, the gamer who is contemplating buying this game, will know the risks. My friend seems to be able to play online just fine, but I can't.

I'm going to refund this game and instead buy GTA V in the hopes of playing multiplayer there.

[h1] The removal of these songs is a damn shame, Vladivostok FM helped GTA4 capture the Eastern European/Slavic immigrant vibe that correlates to Niko. This is one of my favorite radio stations featured in any GTA game ever, and I am genuinely depressed over this. :( 	[/h1]
R* won't update the game to remove bugs or drm or GFWL, but instantly remove songs after license expires, even on copies that are already bought not just on new one's.
Requires some Microsoft "gaming software" crap, but both the game's online features as well as Microsoft's service have been updated, so now playing GTA4 is unplayable -- you NEED to log in to 3 online accounts to be able to SAVE, however you cannot sign into ONE of those because Microsoft has updated its services. Thus, the game is unplayable, and makes me wish that I had pirated it instead.
[h1] tl;dr [/h1] 
Even modded GTA4 still has problems with the PC version and performance-wise you will definitely be able to tell. You're looking at a title serving as a solid example of budding practices from the last generation, except made by Rockstar so it has that level of attention and care they're known for. Still, expect brown & bloom everywhere paired with very acquired taste driving mechanics and a cover system too sticky for its own good. It is not a bad game and definitely has impressive elements like Euphoria usage, but overall there are too many strikes against it and minor annoyances unless you really want to see the leap series made from its PS2 days. I would argue most of those leaps were backwards despite impressive production, but that's just me.

[h1] Full Review [/h1] 
Grand Theft Auto 4 s probably one of those games I should've reviewed years ago when I first played it, but I also imagine it would've been received much worse considering the state of the PC version. While I'm on the subject it's only fair to emphasize I modded the game with GTA4 Reborn mod which largely handles all the [now] leftover GfWL/XBox Live issues, bug fixes and restored some content like all the songs Rockstar in their expiring licenses wisdom saw fit to remove. Real question is how much can you fix a game that has such deep core issues related to its platform and does it stand the test of time after a decade of open world progress? Well... let's find out, cousin.

Following my usual format story is up first, but honestly if you have any GTA experience you can kinda tell where it's going – start from rags and become a very rich person or disappear anonymously.

This fourth installment does its own thing with a certain twist ending, but that's clearly spoiler territory so we won't go there. In any case, we assume the role of Niko Belic escaping his history concerning Yugoslav Wars shenanigans and who has some pretty bitter memories on the matter as he finds his way to Liberty City where his famed cousin Roman is living the high life. Except it all ends up being fanciful tales considering he barely owns a taxi service and has to deal with pushy Russian mobsters. Well, NB being the protagonist that he is, things certainly take a turn following his arrival and it's not long before he gets to pursue a certain obsession that has essentially ruined his life – track down the person who betrayed him back during the war and got his other friends killed in the process of selling them all out. This becomes the protagonist's primary motivation when you're not being an errand boy for everyone under the sun with their greed and need.

Which is already where my problems start to rear their ugly head. Story in GTA4 isn't really that good and never goes beyond the basic level it starts out. That department is carried more by whether you care about the main cast or not... which could be said about all the Grand Theft Autos from 3 onward, though. And I do care about Niko. Roman less so, but they make for a great dynamic duo until the game kinda forgets about them after the first third or so after which you get mired neck deep in the affairs of organized crime simply because you want to get paid. I'll touch on this more when I get to discussing actual systems and gameplay. Let's just say you're not really working for all that useful payout, so real currency you're looking for are interesting character stories. GTA4 thankfully delivers on those in spades even if they end up being little more than criminal/national stereotypes at their core. From your friendly Rastafari masquerading as a mobile weapon shop to myriad of Italian/Russian/Irish gangsters and other small time pushers. They all have missions that desperately require someone to solve them and you happen to be available. I would like to point out there are story choices on multiple occasions, but only the very last one truly matters in a sense it determines the ending. Meaning it's not some extensive investment to see both of them unfold.

I feel like any city GTA game is set in almost acts as if it were a character in its own right so Liberty City deserves some attention. Definitely not one of my favorites. It goes without saying the city is based on New York City, albeit representing four out of five boroughs, but I'm not a fan of it being so heavily urbanized and split onto islands. Meaning you're always crossing bridges and I can only assume it may have something to do with hiding loading times because it ended up annoying me and just taking taxis to distant locations was far easier than driving there myself. That's a problem in a game where hijacking cars and driving are both kind of a big deal.

While I'm on the subject I might as well transition into gameplay itself.

Before anything else is said there's a HUGE elephant in the room that has to be addressed – driving physics. I cannot emphasize strongly enough how mad they drove me and were going to play a major role in rating GTA4 negatively as I set out to play the game even back in the day. Until they just stopped annoying me one day as I realized it simply took time to, as kids say these day, “get good” at driving. Not all cars were manufactured equal and you really end up looking for those better, premium cars that handle better overall. Where game makes a misstep is missing any form of car customization past getting a new paint job. I feel like at least some of the inherent problems with these driving physics, where most cars handle like tanks trying to ice skate, could have been alleviated with customization where you get to tweak things like breaks, suspension, etc. Alas such system is absent from the game and it takes a while until good cars become easily available. Thankfully, you can at least store them in front of your apartment(s). It is worth noting there are also bikes, helicopters and boats in the game with airplanes being suspiciously absent. Less said about helicopter controls the better. I just don't get what is it with Rockstar and helicopter controls, but there was little fun to be found in matching altitude while dodging rockets and trying to hit my target with the machine gun simultaneously.

Second-most thing you'll be doing is shooting, naturally. This entry sees the first modern implementation of a sticky system for the series and naturally there were some bumps left to iron out in the future. After pressing the cover button Niko will stick to the nearest viable cover from which you can then shoot wildly or take aim for more accurate shots. Standard fare for modern TPS so far. My problem with the system was this weird [lack of] accuracy if you take your time to aim shots because you kinda have to take into account Niko has to make a move to “step out” of the cover to actually fire which throws off your aim. It's something you learn to compensate for, but bullets basically won't be landing precisely where you've aimed them at. Speaking of movement this ties into the way protagonist moves about as GTA4 embraces that slow, almost weight-based movement some don't like. I didn't mind it, but it certainly takes a while to get used to coming from snappy arcade approach of older 3D titles in the series. One thing I do not like is walking being the game's default movement speed and having to constantly keep a button pressed to run or, god help us, mash the button to sprint. Analog sticks were in use so why couldn't have that range of motion been used instead? At least basic running. It comes off as one of many pet peeves it would probably take Rockstar a game or two to figure out fully.

Earlier I spoke about how money isn't really your reward for doing things in the game. Except it is, but you have nothing to spend it on. Game loves to shower you in cash, and even netting you real nice lump of change after the final mission, but unlike previous games where you could buy real estate to serve as a noticeable money sink, once you buy the clot
This pile of technical crap doesn't work on modern systems. Don't buy it unless you wanna fix forever on your own...
Nevertheless, Valve was so kind to refund it despite the purchase being more than 14 days ago
Worst PC port of all time and Rockstar have made no effort into improving it. GPU usage never goes over %50 while for other games, it consistently stays above %95 which it’s meant to. Not sure what the issue is but it definitely wasn’t optimised properly. Dipping to the mid 30s with a RTX 2070 at 1440p should NEVER HAPPEN and it never happens on any other game even on max settings on the most high intensive games like batman Arkham Knight or GTA V. Also I have a Ryzen 7 2700x so it can’t be some sort of CPU bottleneck. Rockstar just needs to patch this GAME!!!
I played this game a long time ago, and enjoyed it a lot. Even if I don't have a lot of time, I played it elsewhere and it was fun. Though, nowadays, if you want to be able to play this game, you'd better pray you have already made a Games for Windows Live account, or else you're out of luck.

 The site for making an account doesn't seem to exist, so I cannot make a new one. And even though the game insists on using an Xbox account to sign in you still are forced to use GFWL. But that's not the half of it. In order to SAVE the game. As in save progress, and play multiplayer, you require a Games for Windows Live account. What kind of sick person forces you to do that? Now I can't even play the game because I can't remember my GFWL account, or recover it because the site has disappeared into oblivion. 

 Rockstar seems to have nailed the coffin for GTA IV, as far as I see. I wouldn't recommend this because for one it's literally unplayable without a GFWL account. And the fact that Rockstar treats all of its PC ports like trash. It was fun while it lasted, but now it seems Rockstar is putting the older GTA games in their graves. Keep the change, you filthy animals.

All in all, I wouldn't recommend this anymore unless you have a GFWL account. Or you play it on console (I dunno why you're reading this on a computer then.) Hopefully Rockstar will eventually come back and fix this, but for now, the game's fucking dead. Thanks a lot Rockstar.
Not optimized for Windows 10. Had to do a lots of stuff to just to start it without freezing only to have super low FPS at it even in the menu. And this happened with RX 480 and I5 6400, it wasn't even using the all of my hardware...
Can't play it on Windows 10, or maybe steam is the Problem, I dont know. When I activate Steam ingame overlay, it pops up every 2-5 minutes. When I deactivate Steam ingame overlay, fps drops to 5-10.

Support is deactivate, nobody cares about you.

GG NO RE
I could not for the life of me get this game to work. Every time I would something it would always say "seculauncher failed to start application". I hope rockstar will fix the steam port of this game or even better remaster the game but sadly, I highly doubt it as Rockstar seems to be focused of GTA V and RD2.
3 hours in
restarted PC
game was uninstalled?!
"the save game data appears to be damaged..."
have to restart

3 hours isn't much, but nothing guarantees that it won't happen again...

On the scale of gaming pieces of trash, the only thing below cheaters and cheat makers is moronic companies that actually SUE cheaters and cheat makers https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/grand-theft-auto-cheats-copyright-2019-2
Spend to hours of my life making this game run on my windows 10 pc, then i had to play with the worst graphics because my pc is so beefy the game cant read it and for some RETARDED reason decided to lock all the options for me, i looked for fixes and now the game wont even launch. Ill take my refund thank you
I am giving this game a negative review because of all the songs Rockstar removed with the recent "patch". Paid full price for the game now the developer removes some of the best content that made the game enjoyable. Rockstar shame on you. You wont see another dime from me.
Why is Games for Windows Live still a part of this?  I cant create a profile or do anything because its shut down. As a result I can't save the game at all. This is ridiculous.
This game is a piece of work, cant get it to launch at all. Downloaded the game to have some fun and bring back old memories and ended up sitting here for an hour trying to get it to work on Windows 10 with no luck! STOP BUYING THIS GAME UNLESS YOU WANNA SIT AND TRY AND FIND A FIX FOR THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!       ****SCAM****
It's fucking pathetic that GTA: San Andreas was made in 2005, but yet the game runs 90% BETTER than this hunk of shit. I cannot save any fucking game progress unless I make an outdated games for windows account, or to hook up to an xbox account I don't even have! Why do I got to go through this lengthy bullshit process by dowloading all sorts of mods and creating accounts for more than two websites to play a game that was made in 2008? Don't buy this game. I immediately wanted a refund after it told me I couldn't do something as basic like saving a game. Buy GTA 5 or GTA: San Andreas instead.
So after I purchase this game with money, I still have to let you steel my personal information?
No register on some bullshit called window live no saving game? 
And even I willing to register this bullshit I still need to register some bullshit XBOX account? 
I don't even have a XBOX and I will never buy one. 

So F.U.C.K you piece of shit corporation. I am going to refund. 
For anyone who are thinking about getting this game, don't, unless you want to feel like a complete idiot.
Don't waste your money , this game cannot be launched easily you have to download Windows Live , Create Account on WL and then you MAY BE allowed to launch it . Download it from google . Don't buy it
RIdiculous. You buy a game and in order to save you have to get some obsolete account...? I tried just playing without and all it did was crash to desktop. Seems like it can be fixed, but I'm not willing to put in hours to play a game I paid for.
