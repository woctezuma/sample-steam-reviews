PUBG is the type of game where it starts off with not caring too much if you die in the first few minutes (approx 90 players alive), after a little while and some reasonable loot and gear has been found, you would prefer not to die at this point but still not too fussed if you die (approx 60-70 players alive). After the 3rd/4th blue circle,You start to believe that you can achieve the impossible...you could possibly win...you'll taste the sweet fruits of victory...(10 players remaining)...you've made it to top 10....but you still want more....no more mistakes or joking around now...you're close....(last 2 players)...you believe in this...you can win! But alas...you make an idiotic mistake. You end as #2.....that moment will haunt you forever...

This is what will happen every game, you'll feel rage, anger and above all serenity when you die because you know that the game is over....until you start the next one. 

Welcome to the battleground.
Edit: [i][b]Please keep in mind this review was created during Early-Access[/b][/i]


[list][*][u]First of [i]bugs, bugs, bugs![/i][/u]
The biggest flaw of this fame is the optimization e.g. buildings might not load in, giving your 99 other enemies enough time to pick up an AKM and pelt your ass with bullets. 

[*][u][i]Second, the graphics...[/i][/u]

PUBG is not a graphical masterpiece but that doesn't say that it is bad. Some textures look lazy but overall it looks really nice and more than acceptional for the price.

[*][u][i]Third, the playstyle[/i][/u]
This game unlike H1Z1 or Fortnite (a very new BR game by Epic Games), disourages rushing and rather forces you to take a slow playstyle. This is because unlike in H1Z1 where you can jump out of vehicles and shoot straight away, PUBG makes you stop the car or else you take damage and your accuracy also requires you to be stationary. This is mostly because of the large maps and snipers that are incredibly useful.

[*]Despite flaws this game is extremely fun and competitive, it's in early access so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt...

I recommend!

Bought this game in the morning..
Started a match and died instantly, i told myself I'd play one more, after 10 hours I realised that the sun went down xD 

recommend this game.
Hey developers, do you guys know there are a lot of people who are blatantly selling hacking softwares on the leaderboard? You can simply tell from their id. So I guess my question would be why you guys haven't banned them yet? I mean they are probably the easiest to be detected. For example, wg123456789 is a very typical id that is selling hacks. I understand that you guys don't speak Chinese but you can reach out to me or other Chinese players. I speak very good Chinese and English and know all the ins and outs of this shady market.
I'm not usually a Battle Royal player, but this game is perfect for my play style. 
ARMA is too "hard core" for me
H1Z1 is too arcadeish for me.
PUB fits right in between those two, and it is really well done.

Looking forward to the next 6 months to see how the games progress with the optimization the devs will focus on.

100% worth the price tag.
- (YES I recommend this game)-, but when I want to be able to duo or squad up with people from my region which is NA and all I get are people I can't understand and they dont understand me so how am I or they to win when we can't communicate or make callouts????? SIMPLE SOLUTION

This is just one of those games, its fun, but its always got some new problem. They fix 1 thing but wreck 5 more.
Even that didn't stop me from playing many many hours...
However, now that I can't even get a match in my favorite map anymore I have stopped playing for the time being.

3/5

Recommend... kinda?
Fun game when its not run simulator at times. Recommended for the fun gun play and those times you're hunting players or being hunted...however avoid purchasing the survivor passes...they have some of the worst asinine missions.
This game is just one of the best games that i have every played in my life, The only problem with this game is that i can not select the reoign that i want to play in. But other wise this is a 10/10 game i suggest it to all the FPS gamers out there!
This games has many bugs.  Some funny and some frustrating.  It's better when you have a squad.  I would recommend it though.  Hopefully it will last.
Best game I've played at high intensity since CS and LoL. It's a hard game, but I love the mix of gun mechanics and stealth. Every game is a new adventure. Even better when played with friends. Could totally quit my job and play this full time ;).
I think it s a great game, man. But what hurts most is...IT IS NOT FRIENDLY TO NEW PLAYERS AT ALL!!
Even you are a new player ,you can still find you get killed by G or old men!!😡😡
This was a great game for a long time, but recent efforts have fallen short. The game remains troublesome from a netcode perspective and in Australia, it is quite painful trying to get a game on many of the play lists.

Despite these challenges, it does provide a unique Battle Royal experience with its focus on realism, large maps, and game flow.

Grab it while on special and give it a shot. When everything works, it is one of the most intense and horrifying experiences you will have as the circle closes, and the game nears the final 10.
This game is so addictive that I have had to uninstall it. It was eating up too much of my life. If you haven't already played it, play it. You will see a lot of haters in this reviews but most of them have hundreds of hours on the game, which tells you how bad it actually is.
If your looking for an intense shooter game like BO4, this game is not for you, it@s more like rainbow six siege on a large scale. And I don't get why all the people are so mad at some of the points like:
The optimasation hase improved with every update and I feel like at this point I am confident enought to say they did a verry good job.
The DLC that everyone disliked is not really a DLC but a seasion pass.
The bugs hase in my opinion disepeared after the snowmap.
I feel like this game is a combination of arma and bo4 - tactics are needed to play this correctly early game, but if your in the last circle pure skill and bo4 like stratigys happen. I feel this game hase a lot to offer.
This game has started and made the battle royale game mode to be an absolute and very likeable game. Almost all BR games were created in the likeness of PUBG, Realm Royale, Call of Duty: Black ops 4, Apex Legends, and many more. I still do recommend this game because I almost played it for a thousand hours, but the fact that this game is good, it is also a game that only thinks about profits. The developer does not care about how to make the game better thus they jusy kept on adding new maps and new skins. Hope they fix the game for good.
The most infuriating and buggiest mess of an absolute desync of a game.
Yet its ruined my life 10/10 would frame drop once again for an AWM shot for the chicken dinner
It isn't perfect but nothing is.  If you have a group of friends, or get matched with good teammates, this game rules.  Sometimes you get matched with...uh...not so great people.  That isn't the games fault.  Really fun game and they're always improving it.
If you want to buy the game and be good in a few hours, you're at the wrong game. But if you're willing to spend a few hundred hours, maybe with a friend or two, the few bugs won't bother you.
HEY BLUEBALLS INSTEAD OF JUST NOPING IT AND SHUTTING DOWN YOUR SYDNEY SERVERS WHY DONT YOU REDUCE SERVER SIZE TO 50 OR 60 ACROSS ALL MODES AND FILL YOUR SERVERS, GET PEOPLE PLAYING YOUR GAME AGAIN ON SERVERS WITH DECENT PING AND MAYBE PEOPLE WILL PLAY YOUR GAME WHICH IS ULTIMATELY WHAT YOU WANT. HOW HAVE YOU NOT FIGURED THIS OUT YET FFS??????????????????
Great all round shooter. I very much like the atmosphere as you creep around , very tense, trying to locate weaponry and then the manic climax as the zone closes in. Graphics and weapon choices/actions are superb. I also like the inventory lay out
It's like a homage to our capitalistic world: 

No matter how good you are, just one percent will remain at the top and not necessarily the best one.

It seems that the company responsible for the further development of PUBG also fits perfectly into that philosophy. They could use that sh❤t load of money gotten from selling this game in a helpful way by focusing on fixing old bugs and annoying playability issues, but instead they increase their wealth by adding payable content.

Okay, that content is just cosmetic. It could be worse, right? It could be devil incarnate himself: pay to win. And they added two new maps and a few new guns, maybe ten or a even a dozen. (I could look up the exact number, but I would feel very dumb afterwards.) Let's have a look at another number instead!
The company is Blue Hole by the way, although the term black hole might be more appropriate, worth 4.6 billion US dollars according to Bloomberg News and this primarily thanks to the income made with Playerunknown's Battlegrounds - in numbers: 4'600'000'000.00 US dollars. That's much more than regular idiots like you and me are even capable trying to imagine.

That said, I only write positive reviews: I like PUBG and uninstalled it a week ago.
Many copies and wannabe BR games are out there, but the true original (after arma) is PUBG. Nice updates, optimisations new maps and equipments. I don't play it 8 hours on the row but 2-3 hours gameplay means 2-3 hour of fun... Now with the battle passes it got more interesting, so much more to achieve... try it out
This game is just one of the best games that i have every played in my life, The only problem with this game is that i can not select the reoign that i want to play in. But other wise this is a 10/10 game i suggest it to all the FPS gamers out there!
After receiving game of the year, I believe the game deserves great rounds of applause and I hope to see more innovation through the development of the game!
"Get down Eldrad, God damn it" my teammate screams into his mic as I slam the Prone key. Bullets from an enemy team woosh over our heads,  hitting the rocks behind us. I quickly inject adrenaline into my characters body. My friend does the same. The circle is closing upon us, the last four enemies ready to spray us down as soon as we stand up. I look through my inventory, formulating a plan. I had 1 smoke grenade left.
My buddy and I take off our clothes, in a way which makes it look like there is a player there. The smoke grenade pops over us, and we each rush around, on opposite edges of the circle. Having dropped my sniper back at the smoke, all I have is an M4. Across from me, my partner gets shot, while cooking a grenade, which goes off, taking out 2 of the 4 remaining enemies. At this point I am bored, so I check my rifle is set to automatic, my aim is prepared. I stand up, see an enemy, and hold down mouse 1....
I had lots of fun with this title. While the bugs, glitches and gameplay issues still plague it, the tension, excitement, and good times with friends makes it worth a purchase on a sale. I hope to see you on the battleground!

This game went a long way since launch and it has been improved beyond belief. Since last year it's been fundamentally fixed and optimized, the devs also keep adding in new stuff. As of now there's four maps and a ton of guns and attachments making it the best and the biggest battle royale game, at least in the realistic style. No other game gave me so much excitement and thrill so I can honestly recommend it, even though it might've been irritating at times.
The game is fun. Cheaters are frustrating as hell. We need more updates like #25. Felt fresh and exciting to play. I dont give a rip about an in game replay editor. The original provided enough functionality. And a flare gun? Gtfo. Oh, and those two vehicles were supposed to be in #25. Please do better. Pretty soon I wont be able to recommend people purchase this game let alone justify returning to play myself. Ill be playing Apex until I see what update #27 brings to the table.
PUBG has always been one of my favorites to ply, yes there are bugs, yes it can be very frustrating, yes the game is behind some other BRs out there. There is always something about playing PUBG which always draws me back and I have fun playing on. Between the gun play, and the overal combat it is a very fun game to play and would recommend it!
This game was/still one of my favourite games to play. Everyone complains about hacking yet I have NOT seen one hacker for months, last I saw one was.. I'm guessing around... early 2018 around March? But don't let people fool you, these people complaining about hackers clearly have no skill in recoil control or in general no skill at all.

Buy the game, enjoy it or hate it. Everyone is entitled to there own opinion. But don't let people stop you from buying this game, it's a load of fun.
Have you ever been in a lobby and nobody is punching each other? Me neither. Haters will hate, but I think this game is a lot of fun. Server maintenance is annoying, but fuck people who cheat. If everybody cheats, is it still cheating??? (i don't cheat my kill to death ratio is .28) I'm a noobie to pc gaming.
The best of the best Battle Royal Game to date. It is so challenging that you cannot stop playing it and practice. Wish there could be more maps for arcade so you won't get bored if you played enough on the Basic Royal. Also auto queuing on Arcades would be great.
This game has been one of my favorites for a long time now. I would really recommend this game as I have gotten over 200 hours out of it. It is fun to play solo as well as with friends. I also feel like the Vikendi map is great and was really a good addition to the game.
One of those Games that describes the modern day need of establishing one's superiority over other's.This is MUST HAVE in each and every Gamer.Most satisfying and Best Battle Royale Game...
Still the best battle royal game for me and my friends. Yes, there are still some bugs, netcode problems and cheaters, but overall it's fun game to play. 30€ for countless laughs within our sessions - that's a really good deal.
The best game i ever played. I always enjoy when i play this game. When i play CS:GO, i always stress. Like deranking etc. I have nothing to lose when i lose in PUBG. Best game:)
This game is like dating an alcoholic. They're a lot of fun to be around, and you legitimately like them. But they have serious problems that ruin the whole relationship. You keep thinking they'll change, but they never will. Instead they'll just try to sell you an Event Pass to see parts of their body.
The developer is responsible for the massive amounts of cheating and racism that occurs on this game.

The [b]loot crate system[/b] has a corrupted market. Players aren't cheating to hurt people, it's because of money. Banning won't fix this as they use the earned money to easily gain entrance; this is a job for people, they're not going to stop cheating because it replaces their jobs with something fun.

[b][h1]THE DEVELOPER KNEW THAT GIVING UP THE LOOT CRATES WAS THE ANSWER[/h1][/b]

[spoiler][u]I'm not buying anything made by Brendan Greene[/u][/spoiler]
I've encountered this game just like 99,9% of it's player-base did, by watching Twitch streams and youtube videos.
Being something relatively new in the multiplayer scene (THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER-BASE), I managed to talk few of my friends into playing it.

I'm not going to lie, we've spent hundreds of hours on it.

That was until the official release of 1.0
Keep in mind that we're talking about previously most played game in the world at some point, a game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers), and as any sane person, you'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes, right?

LOL wrong. We're talking about Bluehole here.

You really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine, and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything, massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators, insane ACTIVE player-base, a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything.
They got money, they got everything. And what do they do?:
 
In game purchases.

It's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players.
They rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in-game purchases, and instead of actually WORKING on it, what do they do? More platforms.
Not only that none of the platforms performed remotely well, they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in-game purchases.

Since I could go about this all day long, and considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developer, I'll focus on it now:

Pros:
- Fast queue times due to high player-base,
- SOLID graphics.
- Good ballistics (Sniper and AR bullet drop)


Cons:
- Fully released game some of the problems that should have been fixed before the release.

EDIT:
- PLENTY OF CHEATERS. Even though the developers started to take action against hackers now that the game has headed to ruin, there are still PLENTY of non-conventional cheaters such as VPN abusers (lifting ping on purpose to abuse the poor netcode and hit detection) and Macro users (Auto-aim/Recoil control). Even though the numbers have dropped, this is still heavily affecting the game and user experience.

- Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting, getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed, reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...)

- HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium-high settings at all times)

- Hilarous netcode. So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn't even have a line of sight, constant stuttering, 60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect.

- Horrible bullet detection system (this one mostly affects Shotguns)

- Retarded level design. This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map. They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size, but ironically has least content, least quality looting area, a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone). Even though the original map is better, they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone.

- EDIT: Since one of the recent patches, my character no longer stutters while running, proving my point this was indeed caused by the game, and not by my PC or internet connection.

- I will stop with Cons for now since there's only so much time I can waste on this review. But yes, there are way more.


################

Bottom line, if you haven't already bought this game: DO NOT. Save your money. There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new game, and they're even free to play. They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG has, and that's a shame, but at least they're optimized. Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game, let alone play it properly.

This is not a dead game yet, there's still time to fix it.
This game was killed by greedy and incompetent developers. They have made A LOT of money out of us, but they still refused to fix their game, they kept releasing broken updates while turning a blind eye on actual problems such as rampant cheating. 

They said there would be no micro transactions before the game left EA; they lied. They said the game left early access; they lied, it's still not as optimized as a game this big should be. They are sueing Epic Games because they are seeing a dip into their profits and they are too self absorbed to realize their own incompetence is turning players away, not a better competitor.

This company is interested in creating more paid content, they don't care about fixing what they already have now, they don't care about you.
If you re in Australia, or NZ, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.
The server have been completely broken for months now, so unless you enjoy 300 ping, don't bother. 

The developers, amongst 1000's of complaints stretching months, have yet to officially comment on the situation once.

Disgraceful company, broken game, should be pulled from the Australian and NZ Steam market. This is an unplayable product still being sold. I feel sorry for anyone who has bought the game recently only to realise they can't a ctually play.

EDIT: 5th October 2018, update was pushed many months later which seems to have mostly fixed the server issues, but not entirely.

The game is playable again, I would still rate the experience negatively overall, but it's at least a working game again.
PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it?

[b] Mistakes / poor decisions: [/b]

- First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.

- Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.

- No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or "xenophobic" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.

- Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).

- Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.

- STEREO sound... what year is this??

- Some "minor" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor.

[b] What would make this game better? [/b]

- Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.

- Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).

- Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.

- Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.

If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.

- Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their ass. I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy pricks!

- Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue. 

- Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.

If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens.

[b] Why is it so popular then? [/b]

It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.

All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.

The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.

There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say "China numba wun".

Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream.

[b] Edited to add: [/b] To those that say "engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.

PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game. 

Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could "easily handle 100 players" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.

[h1]UPDATE 3: Remember "FIX PUBG"? Yeah, me neither. [/h1]

Bluehole promised to FIX PUBG, and they had shown us a roadmap of all the fixes and changes they would make before the end of October. Surprise surpise... we are nearing the end of October and they haven't done much at all. The community is losing hope and the devs keep on apologizing for the terrible servers and in-game bugs.

Shame..

------

[h1]UPDATE 2: The "FIX PUBG" Update[/h1]

Bluehole have just released the 12.7GB "FIX PUBG" update, with quite a lot of performance improvements and gameplay changes. They are actually doing things! The review shall stay the same, atleast for now. If they continue with the improvements and make the game stable, maybe things will change.

"FIX PUBG" is appearantly a campaing they're having, aimed at... fixing the game.
You can find the roadmap [url=https://fix.pubg.com/]here[/url]

------

[h1]UPDATE:[/h1]
There have been a few updated recently which patched things up a bit, but only a bit. Server performance is still the same and all that.

------

[h1]ORIGINAL REVIEW[/h1]

Optimizing the game? Nah.... Fixing networking issues? Nah.... Fixing bugs? Nah..... Better servers? Hell no...

Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!

Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!

Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? Fuck yeah!

----------

But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:

+ Engaging battle royale mode
+ Incredibly fun with friends
+ 3 large scale maps
+ A variety of guns and customization
+ Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant

- Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however)
- Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups
- Server issues, desync and rubberbanding
- Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key)
- Inferior Event Pass design to other games
- Ignorant Map Playlist design

- High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me.
- The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)

---------

Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well. Hell, even I still play it, but I wouldn't necesseraly "recommend" it to anyone new to the game, not right now.
I used to really enjoy playing this game. It did start with a lot of glitches and it took a very long time to fix them but it was overall positive….until the developers decided to turn off the Oceania server without explanation. I find this a very greedy act. The game has become unplayable with a ping over 200 (used to be 20). I highly recommend anyone in Australia does not buy this game.
1241 hours in this game.... I first want to say to the Dev's Thank you so much for bringing Battle Royal to us gamers. Millions of us had never heard of it or dreamed of it. Thank you for that. 
But... And i do mean BUT!!!!  It's been years now and the desync is getting worse. I die so much without seeing my killer only to see him run around the corner to look my body that is 5 feet away. I'm truely sad that after all this time nothing has changed. New maps yay, New weapons yay, New I don't care!!!!!! I am finally uninstalling this game and i hope to never return, I'm sure i will because i hate fortnite and i hate Call of duty. But i will uninstall again. Because i have lost faith that you will ever find out how to get Desync to a reasonable level. This is maybe the saddest review i've ever writen. normally i'm just mad but right now i'm just disappointed in knowing that Pubg will never be what we all hoped. A great BR game that fixed it's issues. Instead just another broken game that spent to much time trying to push loot boxes down customers throats.
I have played 1800+ hours on this game (not including the hours on test servers and CES), but now I am done with it. More and more hackers and cheaters, worse and worse optimization, frequent game crashes and connectivitiy issues, these are things BlueHole should be dealing with instead of pursuing lawsuits against other companies.

I felt a little disgusted when the new crates require the steam purchase of keys. However I still thought it was a good way to support their DEV team so that they could solve the gaming problems at that time. Now the problems are still there and are even worse, and it certainly shows the motive of the company is not to improve the gameplay experience but to milk every penny as fast as possible.

We used to have a lot of fun in this game, and I am really appreciated that I made serveral good friends on PUBG. But now it is time for me to sell all my ingame staff and uninstall the game.

If you are new to this game, I am not recommending it.
In my nearly 300 hours (at the time of writing this) I have experienced:

- People who can shoot me around corners due to ping
- People who form a team of 8 in solos and proceed to gang bang anyone else
- People who can instantly lock on to me and shoot the wall im behind with no recoil
- People who can shoot through the wall im behind
- People who can shoot directly at the ground 4 km away from where I am and kill me
- People who can fire a Shotgun like an Assault rifle despite not having a AR equiped 
- People who can turn cars invisible so when im driving my motorbike across the military bridge I slam into a invisible car, blow up, and then the car materialises

And if you say none of these people listed above were chinese. 
I'm sorry.
But you are deluded 

Region Lock China
You can see by my playtime that I'm not just some purchase-regretting wanker that didn't realize until 2 hours in just what kind of game they purchased. I've been playing for well over a year, only not as frequently lately, and it is because of my last few months of experience with this game that I can no longer recommend it to people.

This game started off great. There was so much promise in its concept and execution. You could almost feel what the game should eventually be even waaaay back in its early state, back when it was so broken that a stun grenade in a busy portion of the map like School would spell disaster for several teams by promptly crashing their games with no capability to return to the match. And yet, even with absolutely infuriating scenarios like that, I am finding myself looking more fondly upon those memories than I do towards the game in its current state. And it's not from lack of improvement. Such game breaking bugs like that have been removed, and the core gameplay is leaps and bounds more smooth, intuitive, and reliable. However, there are still massive faults.

I am an average player. I have won many, many chickens between solo, duos, 2-man, 3-man, and full squad. But I died/lost 4/5 games I played, a figure which has increased dramatically as of late. I haven't won a game in weeks, nay, quite possibly over a month. And it hasn't been from lack of trying, and certainly not from good teammates. Is it balance changes? It can't be. SMG's, DMR's, and the AK currently reign supreme, my favorite and most used weapons in the game. They shoot better, tighter, and more naturally. Aiming feels great. The new attachments and scopes are great. All of the map changes are great. Every improvement they have made has been great.

So what is it? What is my problem with this game?

As of 6 months ago, this game was a cesspool of Chinese cheaters, leaving most matches in a state of absolute chaos and dismay as you get to the final several people alive only to be instantly headshotted by some cuck with an aimbot that couldn't possibly have had a bead on you from 150m out with an (at the time) incredibly underpowered Vector. And while the volume of this has subsided, [i]it still fucking happens[/i]. What's worse is that it is no longer just foreign influence to blame. There are plenty of English speaking cheaters as well. And what makes matters worse is that the death cam and spectator views in the game are so broken that in many instances it's hard to tell if someone [i]isn't[/i] cheating because more often than not, the perspective you end up seeing shows wild shots into the distance, inhuman camera snaps, and impossibly compensated recoil that leave you itching to hit that report button. Are people really this good? Was 6 months all it took for people to get [i]really, really[/i] good at this game even after it had already sold 20+ million copies? I often tend to think not, and as such, any and all suspicious deaths now get a gracious report regardless of what I see in the death cam. And honestly, [i]that's not fucking cool[/i].

But to blame cheaters for all of this games shortcomings isn't fair, because that isn't every game. Sometimes you do just get outplayed or royally screwed by RNG or core gameplay mechanics. And I think that's where the true fault is in this game. Now that a lot of bugs have been removed and the core gameplay has been overall tightened, it's beginning to show that the base game is just...not that good. Yes, weapons are balanced, movement and interaction are much better than they used to be (though sometimes still infuriatingly clunky and unresponsive at the beginning of the game), but to call the game itself balanced is rubbish. Either you get lucky and nobody drops near you, giving you a chance to actually find gear, or you don't and you die instantly, leaving your team at a disadvantage and more often than not resulting in an immediate return to the lobby as no single member of the party wants to spectate for the next 20 minutes. This simple aspect of the game is both rewarding when you make it through, and anger inducing when you don't, cursing RNGesus to hell as you slam your left mouse button with so much hatred over that "Exit to Lobby" UI element.

But that is only one source of frustration. The other is how the game handles characters being behind cover. This is I think the most important complaint any player could make about this game. I have in the several hundred gigs of replays and game captures so many instances of deaths where I am shot by someone hiding behind a tree or rock or building, where only the teeniest, tiniest part of their head is exposed from the cover, yet somehow according to the game mechanics, their gun is also able to fire around that cover and complete a shot. Yet it seems when I try to do this same action, I feel completely exposed. No matter how much I lean into and creep around a corner, it's as though my entire body is exposed, and I am more often than not targeted and shot within milliseconds of bringing my gun up to aim and tapping the peek controls. For a game that while obviously isn't rooted purely in realism but still tries its hardest to bring a sense of reality into player interaction, instances like this absolutely confuse me.

Another current aggrivation includes hit detection and the application of armor values. I played a game a couple nights ago where a player in a ghillie suit was creeping his way into the circle while my squadmates and I began popping shots at him. I hit him 3 solid times with a Mini 14 from ~ 150m out. Blood on each shot, absolutely unmistakable hits right to center mass. Another teammate scored another 2 shots on him with a SCAR-L, and another teammate with an SKS delivered the killing blow with 2 well placed headshots. Upon making my way over to him, I noticed something incredibly strange. His body contained a fresh, untouched and undamaged level 3 helmet, as well as a level 3 vest that still had a whopping 173 armor value left on it. We even compared game replay footage afterwards to confirm our blood splatters, all of which according to our games showed a total of 7 confirmed hits with fully outfitted, high damage weapons. How is this possible? What about the headshots that killed him, that actually confirmed in the kill feed that he was killed with a HEADSHOT? How does this translate to no damage being taken to the level 3 helmet?

This is not the first instance of this I have seen either. Since the latest balance changes, body armor appears to have become...broken. At times, you'll feel as though your level 3 vest does absolutely nothing when you get hit in the chest from 300m away with an M24 and your vest is destroyed in a single hit. And yet other times you'll find yourself hitting someone repeatedly with a similar sniper/DMR, only to see that shiny glint of a green level 1 helmet or the washed out blue of the level 1 police vest still intact and on their body.

I'd like to believe I'm just crazy. I'd like to believe I just suck. But then I play a game or two where things just work out and I wipe a team, maybe even two by myself. And while I would love for those moments to redeem this game, to make me go "Wow that was so worth the pain and anguish of the last 11 games filled with absolute bullshit", it isn't. Not anymore. Because even those games were you find yourself wiping squad after squad, you still get to the final couple circles only to be met with a fate that often feels engineered to put you at odds with someone who just happened to get lucky in one way or another. It is this inconsistency that makes this game feel like a waste of time.

Winning is no longer a reward of skill, it's a byproduct of luck and inconsistent game mechanics. More often than not, you'll find yourself feeling like you've simply wasted your time playing this. Sorry PUBG, but you've lost my love, and it's time for us to see new people.
It starts off incredibly fun at first, and will give you an insane rush in your first few matches. Winning your first match is a feeling that few things can compare too. But I'm going to tell you now, once the honeymoon phase wears off, this game QUICKLY stops being fun and you'll begin to notice just how awful the quality of it is.

- The netcode in this game is absolutely atrocious, and is hugely abusable for players with a high ping. The extremely low tickrate and insane desync that results from it means that you're constantly dying around corners a full second after taking cover - or worse, dumping half a magazine of full-auto assault rifle into someone as soon as they come around a corner, only to get onetapped by them mid-spray because they'd already come around the corner and shot you dead on their end two seconds ago, before you even saw them start moving on your end. No ping cap or region lock means players can queue for matches on servers halfway across the world and instantly get an insane amount of peeker's advantage.

- There's a huge cheater population in the game that has been there ever since PUBG started getting popular. Aimbot, wallhacks, recoil scripts, teaming in solo matches, the list goes on. Battleeye does next to nothing to stop this.

- There are still bugs galore that need to be fixed, some of which have been in the game since alpha. Randomly dying from fall damage just because you brushed up against the wrong wall/object, vehicles glitching into walls or flying into the stratosphere from the slightest collision (admittedly hilarious but still in need of fixing), hit registration being complete garbage - there's just too many to list here. 

But in their infinite wisdom, Bluehole decided to let all this go through to the 1.0 release instead of actually making the game a release-ready product, likely for Christmas sales.

TL;DR: Don't get this game until it's actually in a release-ready state, if it ever gets there.
We love the game, it is a fantastic game - however EVERY SINGLE GAME is filled with hackers now. I can basically guarantee every single day you play this game you will experience a hacker of some kind.

Hackers:
Locking sights onto your location (THROUGH WALLS) - check.
Aimbotting - check.
Getting kills without their crosshairs being over you - check.
Lambert - check.

If the hackers are not taken care of it will completely destroy the game.
Hacker Central. PUBG is a great game (my personal GOTY 2017) but Bluehole doesn't seem to care about the hacker epidemic that is currently ravaging their golden goose.

https://streamable.com/j39mx

A hacker squad like the one I recorded above per game, at least. Unplayable until fixed, which is quite sad, considering my love for the game.
I really want to like this  game.

That's the kind of thing you hear from someone who's describing an early-access game, or an indie game that was made by two guys. Instead, this multi-million dollar, 1 year+ old cultural phenomenon is more broken than a browser-based flash shooter from the early 2000s. Unreliable servers, atrocious communication from the developers, an uninformed attitude by Player Unknown himself, the worst in-game purchases I have ever encountered in a game, an engine so unoptimized it can't be played on reasonably on the best hardware available, and a development timeline that has somehow made the game run even WORSE over time.

I've played this game for over 450 hours and since mid-2017. It's not getting better. It will never get better. Save your money.
2000 hours I have spent waiting and praying for the dev's to get their shit together. I was loyal and deticated to what I thought was an up-and-coming game. I, like most people, was fine with a few bug here and there. I just assumed that as time passed the game would get better. It didn't. It remains a broken mess and the dev's are trying to patch the holes with cosmetic bullshit. The game is dying, if it's not already dead. Take it from a guy with 2000 hours of pateintly waiting for one of my favorite games to be fixed, the dev's don't care. They have absoutley proved that they only care about the revenue, and I refuse to spend an extra $12 to unlock challenges THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE GAME TO BEGIN WITH. This game is frustrating at best. I was so exxcited to see what direction they would take PUBG and they ran it straight into the fucking ground. Save your money and play fornite. At least their game works.
the chinese have 3 servers to choose from but they decide to go to OC and NA servers, mind doing something about that?

Edit:
OC is the worst, its the closest to their country so thats their first option, i have only found one group of australians in a test of 30 squad battles. This is absolutely ridiculous. But I guess the devs are more interested in making money off crates than actually listening to the thousands of outraged fans

Edit 2:
Not to mention the fact that the game runs horribly for a simple shooter game that had months of alpha and beta testing. You would think by 1.0 (the FULL RELEASE) that they wouldve at least fixed the optimization problem, let alone the Chinese issue. Until these major issues are fixed i will not be playing the game, and maybe getting people to stop playing the game will hopefully make the devs realise that people dont like the current state of the game, and that their game is at risk of losing a lot of players. Because right now they only care for money and more players, they have no idea how to appeal to their players wishes and make an actual enjoyable game, not just a money making machine.
Update:
A NEW CHEST APPEARED. BUY A KEY AND UNLOCK IT.
Wow.
Theres a new Update. FPS Hotfix? Nope. Stuck in a 1 cm height hill Fix? Nope. A NEW CHEST APPEARED.

A vision of success butchered by greed. 
------------------------------------------
As a life-long gamer I have learned there are two ingredients that, when applied, spell out destruction. Greed and disregarding your fanbase's concerns yields a drop in customers as well as reputation. I will write an honest, unbiased review based off of my gameplay experience and thank you for taking the time to read my review. 

*For the sake of the review I will include the whole entity of PUBG (head company/developers/publishers) when I mention "PUBG"*

Going back a few years, I spent a good amount of time in DAYZ:SA. I really enjoyed the loot/survival aspect, but the game was being developed far too slowly and I was ready to move on. I hopped on the Battlegrounds train while it was in the beta stage and I was impressed. In the midst of a growing market of battle royale games I decided to give my time and money to PUBG because I anticipated a lot of great content. Normally I pray the rosary at the thought of "early access" games and throw holy water on pre-orders, but after reading several great reviews I wanted to see what the hype was about. From conception to release, the game seemed to grow exponentially and everything was going great. They even had 2 crates, Suvivor and Wanderer, that you didn't need a case key to open. Was this CD PROJEKT RED manifesting in a different form? Everything was going well until the introduction of paid crates. 

The core things I like about PUBG at this moment in time are:
*Diversity of weapons
*Diversity of attachments
*Character agility (vaulting/jumping/crouching/prone/swimming)
*Vehicular maneuverability
*Vehicular diversity
*Access to every building, making it feel immersive

The core things I dislike about PUBG at this moment in time are:
*Clientside lag
*High ping players being grouped with low/moderate ping players
*Paid Crates/skins
*Bluehole trying to scrape as much money before the game capsizes
*Useless weapons (crowbar/machete)

To me, this game feels like a cash grab. Instead of fixing their netcode, separating players based off of ping, and developing a structured game, PUBG does the opposite. It caters to a younger audience that doesn't know any better about the prinicples of gambling, attempts defaming Fortnite instead of taking some ideas and implementing them in a better way, and bases the game off of an economy. Anything that is based off of economic gain, and content not in the interest of customers, on a fundamental level WILL collapse. Once the economy runs dry, so do the developers and the trend follows all the way through to the top, whereas the opposite will happen if you keep your customers happy. What's more upsetting is the "FIX PUBG" button in the menu on the top right once the game loads. It is up to the developers to create, patch, and improve a game while listening to the player. Instead I get the feeling that our concerns go in one ear and out the other while continuing to release new crates/skins/clothes.

Dean Hall promised so many fans a working DAYZ:SA, but once he reached his financial goal, he ran and left the DAYZ:SA corpse to rot in someone else's hands. History repeats itself.

Vote with your wallet. Do not support this game or any others that are more interested in your hard earned money than they are interested in giving you a fun, memorable experience.

At the time of this review being published, I have logged 275 hours into the game.
The game HAD a lot of potential last year. 

First some PROS:
+ Still might have some potential...
+ Highly competitive -> no storytelling, just get in the action (for those who want this kind of games).
+ Thrilling -> reaching the finale is a quite an adrenaline boost, you have to focus in, stay sharp and vigilent.
+ Quite difficult -> weapon mechanics for example: bullet drop, recoil, weapon attachments, bullet travel speed, damage etc. have to be considered and make the game harder to master thus more interesting and rewarding.

Now let's get to the points which make all the PROS above irrelevant. The developers managed to turn this game into absolute garbage: 

- Doesn't matter what kind of PC you have: Crashes, Stutters, FPS Drops 24/7
- Doesn't matter how fast your internet is: Their servers don't give a damn
- Doesn't matter how good of a player you are: You die to game bugs, lags, freezes, crashes, desync ent.
- Doesn't matter if developers see these comments: You get crates with fancy clothes to dress your character and patches that continue to ruin the gameplay and performance.
- Doesn't matter that new maps are released: All of them are unplayable due to the horrible server performance/netcode
- Doesn't matter if you actually want to play: "Servers are too busy. Please try again later."

A few examples:
* You land with a large group o people around that try to defeat you, you find a weapon, you can not pick up the weapon because the game lags out HARD (no matter the internet connection), you die to someone who had "server luck" on their side and actually picked up a weapon.
* You try to remain stealthy and silent so people don't spot you, you die because someone followed you by seeing your bugged out weapon models randomly hanging in the air on the path you took before.
* You get shot at, you see who it is and hide behind a big ass rock. You are perfectly hidden, the guy doesn't see you and shoots at the air near the rock, you die because these shots hit you. (Confirmed with death-cam)
* You run into a guy, blast a shotgun right into his chest/face at close range, (blood shows confirming you hit him) but somehow he's perfectly fine, shoots you and kills you, you check the death cam - his HP remained full all the time.

All examples above do not occur rarely, but daily and theres much more. Welcome to PUBG.

I love this game.  It's really fun and an amazing experience to play with friends.  [b]However,[/b] there are two things are that holding this game back.  The streamers and the developers.  Arguably, the streamers are the ones that made this game famous but as of right now, they are ruining it with the help of the developers.  

[h1][i]"There are two rules for success...  Number one, never reveal everything you know."[/i][/h1]

[b]The Streamer.[/b]  These are the people who cry and whine about stream sniping.  I have to be completely honest, I feel sorry for these guys...  [spoiler]For being complete morons.[/spoiler]  If you're going to complain about stream snipers then whine to the developers otherwise you're not going to play their game anymore, you need to shut up and get out.  The laziness and the "FUCK YOU, GIVE ME MONEY!" attitude from the streamers disgust me the most.  They could easily put up a delay, blur out information, and block out the map...  [b]BUT,[/b] they choose not to.  Instead, this is where the devs come into play...

[h1][i]"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."[/i][/h1]

[b]The Devs.[/b]  With very little to no proof at all, they will ban you outright because a streamer cried stream sniper.  In fact, the devs don't even need proof, the streamers' tears and butthurt emotions show all the proof that he's a salty loser.  You guys need to listen to the real community, the Steam reviews, the people on Reddit.  Not to the dumbasses who stream and cry "STREAM SNIPER, BAN HIM!" whenever they get salty about being killed.  At this point, there are possibly more innocent people banned than actual stream snipers.  Go for the real problems, the hackers, the exploiters, and [b]OPTIMIZATION.[/B]  This is completely unacceptable and you guys are sucking the streamer's dicks.  

[h1]TL;DR[/h1]

[b]DEVS,[/B] you guys need to man up and tell these guys to fuck off.  

[b]STREAMERS,[/B] if you got killed because you couldn't bother to hide important information, you're an idiot and you have no right to complain.
Somehow this game got worse over time.  It had less issues in early access.

The OC servers haven't worked in months. When asked about it they blatantly removed the OC servers, and now you don't get a choice for which region you want to connect to. So as someone in who lives in Australia, I'm forced to play on servers in Asia or the USA with higher latency.

Then there's the general gameplay bugs. You can easily clip on something while driving and then your vehicle is destroyed. This type of bug has never been fixed.

Other random collision issues on objects when shooting, sometimes you think your shot should clear an object, but because a collision model wasn't done correctly, the bullet will hit something else. Especially prevalent around window frames, the top of fences and walls.

The general player base is terrible. There is no region filter, so a lot of people get stuck with players who don't speak the same language. I've been demanded by Chinese players to speak Chinese on an Australian server.

These are some basic ideas that should have been implemented at the start back in early access.

1. Have a language preference. You should be able to select your native language, and get paired with other people on the same team who speak your language. This will solve the issue of having team mates you can't communicate with. 

2. Default to the server with the lowest ping, but also give the choice for server selection.

3. The ability to report bugs through the player death cam. You can only report cheating in the current state of the game.

Please don't give this company your money. They don't deserve it.

I do like the concept of a battle royale game, but I'm sure another company will do a much better job. This is what happens when you only care about money instead of improving your product. I have no idea how they can call this a proper launch, it's like the game never left early access.
There's always a possibility of getting banned for unknowingly killing a streamer in this game. Beware.

UPDATE: Some egotistical high profile streamers are getting innocent people banned unfairly for small durations and the developers are siding with the streamers. This review is all about this issue. Nothing more, nothing less...
[i]Edit 2018.03.31: yes, i played 300hrs in the game and enjoyed quite a large percentage of those.  that definitely feels like a game i should give a big thumbs up to.  but in the end, a review should reflect how you feel about a game [b]after[/b] playing it.  i've played games for 1-2 hours and loved them and will have fond memories of years later (Timeframe) so # of hours is not a very interesting metric.

i've always enjoyed milsims and PUBG really hit the sweet spot there.  i wanted this game to be where i spend my most precious resource: my time.  i think we all agree that the potential for PUBG to be the ultimate serious FPS Battle Royale was there but has been squandered because the game is so frustrating to play at high level.  with that in mind, here's the original review:[/i]

it feels weird to be thumb downing such a popular game which i myself played for over 300 hours, enjoyed with friends, had some unforgettably entertaining moments in, and whose best players i watched often on twitch when unable to play myself.

however, thumbs down it is and the game has been uninstalled.

when i got the game in september of last year it was a hot [relatively] new thing with amazing potential and it was forgivable to have all the wonky issues (desync, start game lag, etc).  since then, the early access game has gone gold, introduced a new map, added cosmetics and taunts, changed balance in weapons, addressed cheats, etc.  the dev team has definitely been busy and adding a lot of content and interest to the game.

the problem?  the foundation on which pubg is built hasn't changed.  at this point, given the focus of the dev team, this signals to me that it will likely [i]never[/i] change.

the devs attempted to fix the start of game lag by redistributing starting player locations and removing pre-game items.  to me this is a clear indication that the basic problem in the engine hasn't been addressed, just worked around.  the client to client discrepancies due to architecture decisions made early in the development process now seem unlikely to be addressed in the future.

ask yourself how many times the pubg engine misrepresents player positions and angles when a kill happens.  the likelihood is that more often than not someone [typically the one on the receiving end ;)] is shaking their head and it [i]genuinely[/i] doesn't have anything to do with their reactions to what they see in the game.

as a comparison, take the decade old source engine that drives counter strike global offensive.  you can complain all you want about that game but the base it is built on is incredibly solid.  the surprises at every level of play have to do with player skill, not engine quirks.

when TSM_Viss returned from IEM Katowice 2018 in march - having played PUBG only on LAN and not online for several days he had this to say: https://clips.twitch.tv/SwissCaringSowHoneyBadger:

"after playing on LAN you come back to this, you guys have no idea how much lag we play with constantly in this game [...] if they could get the game feeling like how it feels on LAN, online, ho-my-god.  it would be a dream."

it's 2018.

2 decades since Quake World set the bar for responsiveness in online games you simply can't have an action FPS run on an engine that must allow as much unreliability as PUBG and with no signs of that ever being addressed.
There is nothing to say about the whole game and whats going on in there, i bet you know them all.
The only thing that matters now is that hackers are destroying the life out of this game and even with the new anti-cheat system you will experince playing with them a LOT! 
And because most of the hackers are from one single region, the only thing that can save this game is:

Love the game HOWEVER... STOP giving me crates that require keys that i use my hard earned BP for. At no point should ANYONE get a crate that requires a key AFTER spending earned BP which then becomes a waste. Just for this reason I will now not spend a single dollar on keys and will sell every crate for real money on Steam. You didnt stop as just desperado crates which are pulled 1 out of 3 times, but now i do 4 pulls and get 4 different crates that all require keys. Fever, Desperado, Equinox, Triumph. As you serious with this shit. This has to stop and i will not support this business model.

I recommend the game itself but i do not recommend the business practice.
We have supported this game since early access. PUBG has made over $730 million dollars. Yet, it's still not optimized, cheaters are rampant, crates are locked behind keys. Even after charging $30 for the game, they now introduce this $9.99 Event Pass.

They promised us no DLC but while the maps are free, missions, rewards and progression will come at a cost. They ask for feedback but get upset that we're not singing their praises. If this were free to play, none of us would care. It's just a shame. A damn, stupid shame.
This whole thing is a tone deaf slap in the face to all of us who have supported the game since launch. /u/Ford117

It's hard to pay attention to PUBG anymore. As a day one player I loved the game, got my $30 worth but clearly they have lost their edge.
Progress is so painfully slow that the game is just stale, and huge optimization issues STILL exist. This is why the player base is evaporating. 
If you dont mind the devs being gready and being completey out of toutch with the community, and removing features go ahead and buy PUBG. In my eyes there is so much better avalable.

For every bug they fix they introduce 15 new ones. The game still runs horribly, netcode is still a joke and the new "region lock" doesn't work at all.
Excellent concept that was executed very poorly. New monitization driven updates and few performance enhancements are killing the game. A good game that was killed by developer greed.
Banned for camping half the game in a house then killing a squad solo after they had already been in MY house for a few minutes... I think his name was JasonOG or JakeOG wasn't paying him much attention at the time. called me a "stream sniping faggot" when I started laughing over the mic.

I explained I was hiding in a back room for a few minutes apparently on his stream.. I assume this salty faggot didn't show the devs the video or they would know I didn't even know they are streamers. I heard about people doing this but didn't think it would happen to me...I doubt I'll play this again even if unbanned.

 Fun game horrible Mods willing to swing the banhammer because I camped the wrong people.

*UPDATE*

 I've received an apology from PUB stating my "temp" ban was originally for team killing and had nothing to do with said streamer. also stated my ban was never ment to be permanent  "shouldn't have lasted more than 3 days." However I feel its important to state I have infact been unable to log into the PUBG servers for much longer than that. I believe the attention this got from the public was the main contributing factor in the reversal. played a single round after the e-mail just to see if I could. Still won't be playing this game in the future due to the treatment I've had thus far from the mods/devs.
I've put in over 800 hours into this game (and more money than I wish to admit). I have had a hell of a lot of fun playing solo, with friends and with new friends. I am yet to find a game where i get the same adrenaline rush that I get when I play this game but honestly I really couldn't be bothered recommending/inviting anyone to play anymore.

Update #12 (April 2018) broke the OC servers. We had to play SEA or AS servers to be able to actually play a game. A group of 100+ Australian and New Zealand players grouped together (from discord) and tried to join a game at the same time and they just weren't able to. OC servers were fucked! Sure we had the smallest playbase but if you looked at the PUBG sub reddit, we were by far the most vocal. It took 5 months for them to implement a new matchmaking system and all that did was screw over the other regions (NA players being forced to play on EU/AS/SEA servers and vise versa, etc.).

It's been a long time since 1.0 has been released and there's still problems after problems. There really isn't any excuse for how many bugs/glitches/matchmaking problems there have been and how and why they're continuing!

I'm probably going to keep this game installed for another couple months incase friends invite me (but also to see if it actually improves (LOL)) but anyone thinking about buying this game or reinstalling it, i would honestly suggest you keep your money/bandwidth and play something else.

This game isn't made by a competent company. It was a quick cash grab that far exceeded their expectations and they just kept building on top of a broken model. It would have to built again from the ground up and be released as PUBG 2.0 but who would honestly spend any money on this company again?
dont buy this game if you are from Australia or New zealand.
The quick match system forces us to join SEA/AS servers,
average ping 200-300 every game.
After having put in over 1,000 hours into the game, I can honestly say that sometimes, things just don't change. The game tends to be unstable, no matter what fixes I have attempted, and the idea of having bullets render every time they are shot is honestly the singlemost terrible development model in the history of game development. There's nothing like being shot to death because the game suddenly decides it has to render those bullets, therefore causing a sudden lagspike that ruins any aspect of "competition" this game hoped to achieve. 

Another point is that the loot distribution system seems completely off-balance. Sometimes you can drop in an area where you'd expect to get high-risk high-reward loot, and come out with level one gear and a shotgun if you're lucky. Meanwhile, Bobby and his friends went to that quiet little outpost in the middle of nowhere and got all the loot he could ever dream of. It feels like the entire loot system needs an overhaul, and the distribution sorting out because there's nothing better than getting nailed by the guy with a fully kitted M24 while you're rocking a Micro-uzi and level 1 armour.

Also, the current bug with diving from the plane where if you press literally ANY KEY on your keyboard, and you get locked into diving straight down, unable to change your course unless you pull you parachute is something that was present on the test server. But did they fix it? No, they did not. They were too focused on getting Vikeni out in time for Christmas so people would want to play their game again and buy their season pass, and gamble their money away on the off chance they get something absolutely amazing from a chest after spending $$$ on keys and getting the same items over and over and over again.

Now, I know that complaining about the loot boxes will most likely elicit responses such as "Don't buy them then", and the same goes for the premium season passes. Yes, I could not buy them, and I won't, because honestly, the chances of getting something good from a loot box is abysmal, and you're more likely to get the same cosmetic item and over and over and over again, which leads to frustration, and it feels like it's less "random" and more "you're highly likely to get this item because of the set %". If it was meant to be totally random RNG, the chances would be somewhat similar. Yes, I understand that rarer items deserve a lower drop rate, but having the same common item drop time and time again leaves much to be desired, and also tends to leave a rather sour taste in the person's mouth as though they'd just sucked on a lemon slice.

As for that, didn't EA get hammered for their microtransactions and loot boxes? Why should any other company get away with borderline gambling in a game that was designed for enjoyment? Nothing is stopping little Jim from grabbing his parent's credit card and blowing a bit of money to try and get absolutely nothing desirable. Gambling, in its purest form is described as such:

"Gambling is taking part in a game during which you risk money, or something of monetary value, in order to win money or a prize. The outcome of the game is usually down to chance, so when gambling you might leave with less money than you started off with, and sometimes with nothing at all." - quoted from https://www.begambleaware.org/understanding-gambling/

So, that money people are spending on keys? They are buying them in the hopes of winning a "prize" that they desire, but never end up winning. Are loot boxes not gambling? Because in essence, they are gambling, and ANYONE can participate, as long as they have the money to do so. You cannot write off one company's loot box problem saying "Oh, it's different", when another is having lawsuits presented to them over "unlawful" actions.

All in all, I cannot recommend this game, not because of the way the company attempts to grab any and all cash they can, but because the game is severely lacking in bug fixes that REALLY need to be addressed, but they are taking their time in doing so, instead introducing new mechanics and new maps as priorities.

I'd give it a 2/10, purely because it managed to drain so many hours of my life away, and left much to be desired.
Gameplay is solid. But the developers chose to go for a 6 gig update with clothing and paid cosmetics instead of fixing issues that has been here from the start. GG. Lost my vote.
PUBG, a beautiful ship with the potential to reach lands of great content, is hampered by its precarious propulsion system, numerous construction failures and strong storms of criticism. The captain, blinded by his booty, changes the course to nearby islands of wealth, while ordering his crew to embellish the vessel and remove the water from it with a spoon.
I have been playing this game since the very beginning. For a game that was in beta, bugs were definitely expected and understandable. It was a fun experience with some nice tweaks and changes from its other battle royale predecessors. I've given this game a ton of chances but Bluehole continues to destroy their own community with bad game play mechanics and poorly planned "Season Pass" missions that, once you've paid 13$ to get the pass, give you absolutely nothing unless you play the game non-stop, 24/7, for a month or two or be forced to buy level up packs to unlock the items you thought you just bought with the "Season Pass". The absolute shadiest scam I have seen in the gaming industry in a long time. I have no problem with having to work for my items, but level 70+ is next to unobtainable without purchasing extra levels and of course those are the only skins that are worthwhile. While I'm on the topic of "Season Pass" missions, who thought it would be a good idea to make a mission to drive a Mirado for 2 hours? On a map that you can literally wait 20 minutes in queue (both squad and duo queues) and still not get a Miramar game on NA servers. Not only that but when you do get a squad game on Miramar with any random people in the group, that random person is guaranteed to be driving around the outside of the map in his Mirado making it a 3 on 4 for the rest of the game. Great way to support team play and meet new people in the community /eyeroll.

Bluehole has improved very few of it's major glaring flaws since it's beta but you can be sure it'll keep on updating those textures as well as those $5USD/ea character skins. The enemy hit-boxes are a complete joke and don't reflect where the characters actually are on your screen because the servers are just sad for a 40$ game with a boatload of in-game purchases. If you play on NA servers, Bluehole likes to schedule their updates between 6:30pm to 1:00 or 2:00am EST most nights. If any sort of update is launched (even a 20 Mb anti cheat update), be prepared for about 3 hours of "SERVERS ARE BUSY" messages if you try to log in. I guess even with all that money they still haven't been able to figure out how to properly launch an update from a second server that doesn't knock out the dedicated game servers or purchase proper bandwidth for their game.

With a game like Apex Legend that just came out for free, where you can REALISTICALLY grind upgrades, skins and character unlocks without even having to pay a penny, I give this game less that a year before its dead in the water and you can't find a match even if you wanted to. Not to mention the game play is cleaner and more fluid on Apex.

I can't wait to watch this company self destruct for the complete disconnect that Bluehole has with its community.
This game was fun when It came out. I'll admit it is a fun game. But if you live in Australia or New Zeland you can go and get fucked. We no longer have Oceanic server, every time I play I am matched up with palyers from Asian countries and the lag is horrendous. My teammates speak next to no english, if I solo que I am still just stuck with the ridiculous lag.
Honestly dont know why they removed our servers in the first place. Till they do something about us players down under and the Kiwis I think the developers dont give a fuck anymore.
Cheaters everywhere. Buy it when you want to get killed by someone aiming at the ground while you are 500m away in a House. And the worst thing about it is that a lot of the people use an ESP Hack or Wallhack. Also the damn No Recoil crap.
(CHECK OUT THE UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM)

It's an amazing game with a lot of potential, but I simply cannot recommend it until the publisher stops babysitting streamers and stops banning people who kill or disturb them. I don't watch or follow streamers and can't see the point in doing that instead of actually playing the game. This is a matter of principle - if you'the consequences of doing that. And while the streamers get pampered, cheating is completely out of control.

What worries me the most is that Brendan Greene (aka PLAYERUNKNOWN) seems to be a fan of Microsoft and their "software as a service" business model, which already spawned abominations like [b][u][url=https://www.grc.com/never10.htm]Cancer 10[/url][/u][/b]. Thus the lack of plans for Linux and Mac OS X ports and for Vulkan support. I'm pretty sure they have DirectX 12 support planned though and eventually the game might become [b][u][url=https://www.grc.com/never10.htm]Cancer 10[/url][/u][/b] only, which would be a real shame.

[b]UPDATE 1:[/b] with the 14 September 2017 update, the devs decided to go all Microsoft and removed some of the players' choices. The Shadows setting is now being ignored, and a high level of shadows is being forced on all players, together with ambient occlusion, bloom and depth of field. All the bugs reported on [b][u][url=https://forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/66841-test-server-known-issues-read-first]the game's official forums[/url][/u][/b] by people who played on the test servers before the update was deployed to the main servers were solemnly ignored, making me wonder what's the point in having test servers at all.

[b]UPDATE 2:[/b] one of their "community managers" posted an "explanation" referring to [b][u][url=https://forums.playbattlegrounds.com/topic/70545-warning-bluehole-has-just-edited-their-previous-forum-statement-regarding-editing-ini-files]this topic[/url][/u][/b] on reddit instead of on their official forums where the topic was created, so I posted on their official forums that doing that was amateurish of him. A few minutes later, I was summarily banned from their official forums without any previous warning by a moderator going by the nick [b]PUBG_Caesar of Roma[/b]. And to think that I've been helping to promote this game on all the [b][u][url=http://www.noobsforever.net][>NF<] Game Servers[/url][/u][/b] sites and community channels since it was launched...

So, when you post on the PUBG official forums, be extremely careful not to write anything the hypersensitive, touchy-feely "community managers" and moderators might find even slightly offensive to them, or you will be banned without warning and with no chance to appeal the ban.

[b]UPDATE 3:[/b] on 20 December 2017 the game officially left early access state, and I gotta give the devs some credit for having had the courage to release this... thing. They actually managed to make the game look and play and sound worse than the early access version. All textures have been downfiltered and the color palette reduced. Chromatic aberration also seems to have been applied, together with color oversaturation. I would say that, once they admitted to themselves that they were unable to increase the game's performance, they decided to partially achieve that by downgrading the quality of the graphics. And the water... what have they done to the water?!?!? Was it really their intention to make it look like an oil spillage happened?

Now on to the new "desert" map (AKA Miramar). It's hard to find words to describe that abomination. While every spot on Erangel had some kind of "point" to it, with different strategies needed depending on where you decided to land, the new map would probably have been better if they had let a program generate it by randomly placing groups of buildings and hills across the map - because that's what it is, a pointless mess of pointless spots, plagued by even worse graphics than Erangel, with horribly overbright low-quality textures covering the whole thing. 

Any FPS game from the mid 2000's looks and plays and sounds way better than this. I laughed a lot with my friends because some of the new vehicle sounds actually reminded us of someone having sexual intercourse. The bombing sounds are equally laughably inconsistent. I really tried hard to find some redeeming quality to this release but it's so bad and annoying in so many ways that I'm not even feeling like playing the game anymore.

[b]UPDATE 4:[/b] with the release of the new crates on 22 February 2018, I decided today to check out the state the game was in. I only have one word to describe it: [b]ABOMINATION[/b]. They managed to make the graphics and the maps even uglier - even the once glorious Erangel is now hard to look at without my stomach churning. For some reason they decided to shrink the fonts and the game's items, making text harder to read and items harder to pick up. The game's items were also reskinned and look much worse now, as does most everything else. But the icing on this rotten cake is the new "sliding feature". It works like this: when you stop moving, you continue to slide in the direction you were moving for a while. That makes you miss turns, items and enemies all the time. The only reason I can possibly imagine for someone to play the game the way it is now is to get the crates and sell them on the community market.

[b]UPDATE 5 (27 May 2018):[/b] Chinese cheat fest.
Skip it till they lock the chinese hackers to their own server, or maybe start banning them.  Game is currently ... [b]INFESTED[/b] with worthless no talent cheaters.
This game was soo fun at the start getting our first Chicken Dinner was amazing until patch 1.0 came out though almost every round we play we loot find good stuff fast and kill a few at the start.
Then late game die to a hacker who will shoot through two buildings with a SKS with a 8x scope full autoing headshot it's a load of garbage don't buy this game anymore until they fix the major hacking problem they have within it.
[b][u] Totally unbiased Review of PUBG [/u][/b] 

This is my second review on this game earlier I had given it a negetive rating because I was frustrated by the cheaters in almost every match.But that was more of a rant than a review.
Now before I begin (don't worry I will keep things short and precise) please note this is more of an informative review rather than a negetive review.

Like many others I got this game when it was in early access. I used to play it a lot with my friends and had some fun too. I even used to play it a lot in single player mode too when I was new and even then I liked it. But after spending 350+hours I started to get bored.If you are a person who likes to try out almost every type of game then you may enjoy it too for the first 100-200hrs with that you will also get your money's worth.
Now if you are looking for a fair competitive game then I would say look somewhere else as this game may not be for you. Mainly because its unfair and unbalanced.

In PUBG you spend 10 minutes in looting then another 10-15 mins either camping or running from the blue circle. If you are unlucky then you will get killed
soon after you have finished looting by someone from a location which you may not spot easily. Otherwise jump to a crowded location and start testing your luck.
If you take the first approach then for most of the time you ae literally doing nothing in the game except wasting time.
In the second scenario you may not even get a gun by looting a 2 storey house but your opponent will get it within few seconds inside a small house and will kill you with it.
In both scenario's you will either get frustrated and angry or satisfied momentarily (if you managed to kill someone).The game only becomes intense during the last 5 mins.
Loots are generally medical supplies to boost your health and gun attachments to increase the shot's accuracy.

These things may be fun for some people but not for me. But these are not the only reasons I left playing this game the main reasons are these :
1. BUGS. There are a lot of bugs in this game. Lot means a lot.Everyday people are discovering something new. You can headover to reddit to
know more about them. Due to these you may loose an easy win situation. I think many people including me have experienced this many times.
2.Server desync & bad ping are the biggest nonsense in this game.eg: I hit a guy many times but he didn't go down instead he kills me easily with max 2 shots? When I check the 
replay it shows that I only hit him once or twice.
3.Cheaters. Now they are very less compared to last few months. However you may come across 1 or 2 in a day compared to 1 in almost every match previously.(I have upoaded some videos
exposing some cheaters you can view them from my profile)

However bluehole has not solved some of the old bug issues yet (the parachute opening, item visibility while landing etc). Instead they are focussing on something else.
Battleroyale genre is like a fad and nothing else.Every one is jumping in it to make some quick profits till it lasts.
From battle royale genre I have only played PUBG & H1Z1 & I liked the later more. The current state of H1Z1 however is not good & I think PUBG will soon follow its path too.
I think the devs are aware of this too thats why they are trying to grab as much as they could during this time.

Anyways I have nothing against them personally its their decision to make money in whichever way they see fit.Currently I have not much interest in this game.
In the end I would just say getting it or not is completely your decision.

Decent First Person Shooter / Third Person Shooter.

Current problem with the game and why i can't recommend the game:

- There are rubberbanding Issues which results in you not being able to pick up items you are standing op top of even if you spam the pick up item key, which can be crucial and often times outright deadly.

- There are no region lock (this is a problem because the majority of the playerbase is chinese (41% of the player base) and do to an uther lack of competence from the creator of the game Brendon Green they are forced to pay a monthy fee to get access to the game or use a VPN service so they can get around that, and to try and avoide that the chinese players are joining american and european servers, which results in people with an horrible ping will be joining servers they wore never supose to be playing at in the first place (some times you can even be downed by player you have already downed yourself...)

- There is a huge cheating problem in the game. (99% of all cheaters are chinese (this number is taken from the banned list, im not making it up, 99% of all cheaters are from china, so this creates a huge problem for none chinese players when chinese players play on none chinese servers. 

- People have been banned for the crime of shooting Twitch Streamers (doesn't matter if you have a twitch account watching the stream or not, just the act of shooting a streamer have gotten people perma banned from the game.

- People have been banned for driving around the game honking the horns in the cars.

- People have been banned for shoting people that join Squads as randoms who shot their team mates... ye that's right, shoting a teamkiller in selfdefence against other teamkillers have gotten people Permabanned from the game.

- The Anti cheating "service" is more incompetent than Brendon Green. (people have been banned by the system even though they didn't cheat, hundreds of people wore banned and unbanned because of the anti cheat system made false flags)

- The Driving Physics of the game is the worst i have played it years.

- The Creator of the game Brandon Green said that the game would never have Micro Tranctions or loot boxes (he later added them anyway. he also states in a interview that any player complaining about the "cheater problem or wanting region locking to stop people running around on servers they never should have been on Xenophobic and racists bigots.

- Last update on the number of PUBG bans: 1,500,000 Dec 28, 2017 (not all accounts banned that was banned was banned for cheating)

-February 16: PUBG has sold over 30 million copies according to Steam Spy.
So a total of 5% of all copies sold have been banned...

Conclution: I still cannot reccomend the game.
Originally written on Jan 30th, 2018.

Sept. 29th, 2018 update: Hackers are still as present as ever, just in the last game I played I watched a single chinaman instantly headshot 8-10 people without ever aiming downsight from 200-300 meters away.


The problem is still a strong mixture of the Chinese playerbase's rampant abuse of hacks and the devs doing absolutely nothing to fix the problem. Despite the "fix PUBG" campaign they have rolled out hackers are as common if not more common than ever with it being easy to find 5-6 per game by spectating after death, all of them always being Chinese.

Not to mention the other downside now being the long queue times thanks to the playerbase dying due to the previous paragraph's issues. When I first wrote this review there were 3 million players daily, now there is less than a million on average. You know something is dreadfully wrong with the game when it loses 66+% of its playerbase in 8 months.

Avoid this game like the plague and you will be better off.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TL;DR - I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone so long as the developers refuse to take any real action against the game ruining cheats that are running rampant throughout their game. If I could return the game at this point I would. I hate that I have given money to a company that cares so little about their fanbase. - TL;DR


I've got quite a few hours in this game, not enough to be a no-life but enough to know how it is. Let me break some things down for you about this game.


It's almost unplayable. The sheer number of cheaters (literally almost all if not all are from China) has been growing steadily for over a month. Ever since more and more Chinese players have migrated to the North American servers the  population of cheaters has skyrocketed. Allow me to list what will happen to you regularly:

- You will join a lobby and all you will hear is a dozen plus voices shouting in Chinese with the occasion expletive in English. 
- You will drop and find supplies as normal
- You will run in to a solo/group/duo/etc. as expected
- Instead of banter during the firefight all you hear is shrieking and yelling in Chinese (They talk in-game A LOT for some reason)
- You will be instantly shot in the head after you leave cover (often before too) by somebody who was 100 meters+ away and was not even aiming down their sights, just hip firing.
- You will be angry that you were killed by a cheater
- You will take a break for a few minutes
- You will go back to the top of this list.

Literally of the last 5 games I have played 4 of my 5 deaths have been to Chinese who were cheating on the North American servers. I will tell the story of the last death.

Partner and I were on a rooftop picking up a couple items, I see two players brazenly jogging down the middle of the road, one not wearing pants (A telltale sign it is a Chinese player), and tell my partner to get ready to attack them. At this point we have not at any point crested the barrier between us, but the enemy player in front of the duo has been looking directly at my position on a roof in the middle of town the whole way down the road. I told my partner to shoot and within a half second of him standing and taking his first shot he was knocked on the ground, I had also stood up when I said to shoot and I was on the ground almost instantly after my partner. Watching the death cam revealed the instant we both stood up the same player headshot both of us, while running, while firing from the hip. Their target reticule was as large as it could possibly be, yet they managed to hit both of us in the head twice in less than a second at 50 meters while moving and not aiming. 

You could think it was a wildly lucky shot, but when the same scenario has happened twice before tonight alone, it isn't coincidence that all the players doing this magical shots are all Chinese and assuredly cheating. 

I'm not bad at the game, I have multiple wins under my belt, I know what a good player acts like, and none of the Chinese players who kill me act like that.


The game is broken. Not because of in-game glitches or errors (of which there are more than a few, freezing on start is a big one) but because there are hundreds of thousands of cheaters, literally. The developers of the game have openly admitted that a vast majority of the cheating players are Chinese, but sternly refuse to region lock the game and keep the Chinese players on the Chinese servers. They claim it is "unfair" to keep the "good players" out because of "a few bad eggs" However a "few bad eggs" is the majority of over 1,500,000 banned cheaters. It is more unfair to the few Chinese players that do not cheat to be forced to play with all their cheating brethren than it is to the entirety of the EU, NA, SA, SEA, etc. communities and players, who are all burdened by the massive influx of cheaters from a single region.


I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone so long as the developers refuse to take any real action against the game ruining cheats that are running rampant throughout their game. If I could return the game at this point I would. I hate that I have given money to a company that cares so little about their fanbase.
#RegionlockChina

Seriously though, this game is one of the most fun games on the market.  It runs far better than it used to, and every patch seems to bring more and more improvements.  However, there is one glaring problem: Chinese hackers.  

NA servers are INFESTED with Chinese hackers.  I never noticed the issues until recently, perhaps with the implementation of the kill cam.  My partner and I are top .5% in duos, and the game is borderline unplayable at times.  Half the time we get killed, it is by someone with a name like 'ahskf5834732843' or 'lin-feng-838912839'.  Upon review of the kill cam, they are tracking us through walls and snapping straight to where we are even when there is no possible way they knew where we were that fast! The event that caused me to write this review was someone killing us both from 400+ yards away with an iron sights AKM WITHOUT LAYING OFF THE TRIGGER.  Chinese hackers are sucking the fun out of this game.

I love this game, and it really hurts to say it, but unless China is kept off NA servers, I can't recommend PUBG to anyone.
As much as I like this game and the whole concept of battle royale game mode is really intresting I think PUBG really did a good job of bringing out the feeling of the battle royale. Basically placing 100 players into 1 world and letting us killing each other to win either with a team of 4 or duo or solo. But then I just can't recommend this game because of its various problems and how the developers is treating the player base.

[h1][b]First off the game itself.. Or just the whole management of the game[/b][/h1]

First off I will not really blame them for the server issues because handling 1 million plus players does offer some challenges etc but slapping ADS into a game to buy a third party software just to "boost" their connectivity to their game servers is kind of fucked up seriously like wow, they too paid a premium for the game but why is it that after paying for the game they still have to get a third party software to "boost" their connectivity to the game servers? isn't the devs of PUBG themselves should take the responsibility and say "Okay we need more servers for the chinese players"? [b]Honestly I do not care about much about this whole issue because it does not affect me in any way but what if they did this to the English players or the whole player base? " Oh hey our server can't handle the amount of people so please after buying our game please get a third party "booster" software to "boost" your connection" Like what the actual fuck?[/b]

[h1][b]The game trailer..[/b][/h1] 
Looks really good am I right? Looks very interesting, so much intense fighting and feels thrilling. Well sadly the game trailer is just full of SHIT. The trailer is what you would call glitter over a game. Those fights you seen in the trailer out of 100 games you will probably will only ever experience those fights in like 1 out of your 100 games or totally none at all. Those fight rarely occurs because RNG fucks you over or you will be running for half the game from the blue circle just to be killed be some cheater later on. To put it simply the trailer is just a cool montage to make the game look good. [i] [This is not really a problem it is more of me nitpicking at here] [/i]

DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE GAME TRAILER.

[h1][b]Optimization[/b][/h1]
It is really bad. I can run the game smoothly at 60FPS but the rendering of textures in this game is just horrible. I won't even say much for this because it is just obvious when you play the game.

If you are wondering what I am running with for this game. It is not the best but I am pretty surely this can run it at a much better rate

[h1][b]The Devs going back on their word regarding microtransactions is kind of ♥♥♥♥ed up[/b][/h1]

Yes I know it is only for cosmetic purposes and it will not affect the gameplay at all. [ For those people who will say "hey but its only cosmetics" ]
Adding microtransactions means adding microtransactions and them going back on their word there is no other way around. It is like a lie is a lie no other way around it.

So what this means? In the future anything they promise us like lets say a free new map for example. They can easily go back on their word anytime and say that the new map they promised us to be free will be sold as a DLC :D I mean why not right? They went back on their word on microtransactions and it is so blatant, this means that the Devs dare to go back on their word without fear. Oh not to mention the game is still in EARLY ACCESS filled with a alot of bugs.
Oh yes early access with loot crates. Whats next? Needing to open lootcrates to get keys to open other lootcrates? Well if it really comes from this game I won't be surprised at all.

[h1][b]And finally this takes the cake

CHEATERS[/b][/h1]
In this game it is so hard to get first place basically winning and the cheaters is getting extremely out of hand. Aside from fighting other 95 + other players you still have to deal with cheaters!! In the early stages there weren't many cheaters but after some time they grew and there seem to be nothing has been done to put a stop to them. Right now literally every game there is usually 1 cheater lurking just having extreme speed [ The most common I see so far that is obvious ] or just "aimbotting". Just goto youtube and search you can see lots of them. 

[b]Here is an example where I encountered a cheater. [/b]
Was in a team of 4, 1 dead and 3 was alive and 3V1. Me and 2 other friends was alive. [ Note my team was all at 80% HP ]
I was downed by a burst fire from far range [ 4 shots from AKM downed me instantly ] But managed to get revived. I found it very suspicious but i doubted there was a cheater. People do hit lucky shots once in a while. 
But this is where things gets very obvious. Final circle came and then the opponent just killed all 3 of us in an instant and all of us were behind cover. And game over just like that. 
You can say oh we are just bad it is up to you to think what you want but lets be real here you will know someone is cheating when somthing so stupid happens like in my case all 3 of us dies behind cover at the same time instantly. Like if I were to die when peeking ok the opponent may be just be very skiled but no all 3 of us were behind cover.

For those who still says you have not encountered cheaters, well good for you but play the game more and you will encounter them sonner or later.

[i]  Honestly I do not even know what kind of cheats that person was using but it was just plain obvious ] [/i]

Just plain disappointed and disgusted at its practices in this game and how the player base is getting treated.
As long as the cheater problem keeps as rampant as it is right now, I strongly advise against buying this game. Meanwhile the developers call the community xenophobes for literally begging to region lock the chinese players while they swim in money. Even if you don't know how to deal with them, hire someone that does for fucks sake, being the historically best selling game of Steam I don't believe you don't have the required money to do so.

- Lazy ass developers that 'laugh in money'.
- Cheaters every other game that don't even try to hide it.
- Still full of bugs and shit (worth mentioning aswell).
- Yes I'm salty.

#regionlockchina
This game was supposed to be different. 

Instead, it's become exactly what we all hate. They could have taken the $730 billion dollars and put it into the game, hiring new talents to optimize it, make anti-cheat software, create addicting levels and polish the game to the point that most AAA titles could only dream. 

They got greedy. 

It doesn't matter how many hours you sink into their game, or the $30 you spent on the experience. They wanted more. They claim they need to continue making money after making nearly $1 billion dollars. So, they turned the crates you earned through game time into loot box items that were locked behind keys you had to pay for, which in turn has incentivized rampant cheating, ruining the game.

Now, they're trying to sue a company that is more successful for using their one gimmick that they stole from another game. 

On top of that, they've added an "event pass" to rent items that will expire and introduced XP? 

Any criticisms from the community that wants it to do well is met with anger and hubris from the community managers. 

This game has truly lost it's way and no in-game experience can wash away the taste of absolute greed from a company that treats it's community simply like dollar signs.  

So disappointing. Thanks for the memories PUBG but I can no longer enable the monster you've become. 

Good luck with the court case. 


The game can be fun if you can find someone that speaks english to play with. for some reason the chinese players insist on playing in the north american server and the devs refuse to do anything about it. Its not racist to want to play with someone that can understand what your saying in a game where coordination is key to winning.
Pubg is one of the best shooters ive played so far this year and with the hours Ive put in I can not recommend this game in the current state. Ive had 18 Chicken Dinners but something needs to be done with the Chinese/Korean players. Ive encountered many hackers ever since the game came out of early access.Clean out the hackers and make people play in their own regions and youll have a hit. Let the hackers play with the hackers.
I love this game and overall have really enjoyed it but 5 out of my last 15 games i have been killed by hackers and it is slowly ruining my taste for the game. I thought they had an anti cheat system and they "improveed the hacking in 1.0 but at this point it is hard to find a game where i dont die to someone with an asain username the sits 200 meters away with a m4 and doesnt aim in and instant headshots me. Its crazy they dont even hide it because there is nothing to stop them. FIX THE GAME PLEASE!
Bluehole Chinese Official indulges Chinese famous game streamer "55kai" Lu Benwei with repeated cheating behaviors on Douyu Streaming Platform, which makes a extremely immoral example for teenagers and all players and lovers of PUBG.   

His id is "nihaonihao123123" and "Watson555"

We protest against Cheating and Official's ignorance!

We Need Justice and Fairness！
Terrible game, bullet registraion sucks, game crashes all the time, bad optimization, not worth the time. i have 750 hours in this game, and it has only gotten worse since 1.0. dont give bluehole ur money, they only add stuff and never fix the worst glitches.
Developers logic In simple words

1) lets make Battle royale game 
2) makes the game 
3) sets settings on recommended that everyone can play it
4) Gets money for game, and some awards
5) gets popular in worldwide
6) gets greed for money.
7) update graphic settings to NASA PC's
8) adds dlc's
9) Ruins game

P.S cant even refund this game because they aint even answering, and ruined game after 14 days refund limit
Dont buy this one if u are not rich and dont have place where to spend or waste money, better buy oldschool consoles and play mario, its good for u , not like this one when they gets greedy and ruin games...
It's a dumpster fire of a game, simple as that. The visuals are a travesty of what can be accomplished with the Unreal 4 engine, and the game runs worse than DOOM on a calculator. The gunplay is wonky and guessplay at best, and most matches you spend 20 minutes running around looting things then die from 500 meters away from a person you never see, or from some Chinese hacker because the game doesn't have seperate servers.

This game is really disappointing, high delay, difficult to get started, no matter what the wrong number is sealed, there are many plug-ins. Don't buy it for anyone who hasn't bought it yet. This game and this company are fucking rubbish. You'll feel bad about buying it.
Found it extremely hard to pickup and develop my skills. Most players are already at advanced levels, you set yourself up for 15 minutes only to get headshotted/rushed by a pro each and everytime.
Started as a great game, then quicky turned into a microtransaction cashgrab. Game' s performance was getting better until about 1 year ago, when the fix pubg campaign started, since then the performance is only getting worse on high end systems. Game still suffers from very bad netcode, with lots of lag. Event passes are designed with quests like drive 500 km with a buggy so that you can't possibly get all items for the price of the pass in time and have to spend up to 70 dollars for levels. Absolutely unbelievable what this game turned into. Don't buy this trash
Such GOTY material. I love falling through the map at the start of a round and playing on playdoh optimization. Oh and those random network errors in the middle of almost every match. Steam awards can't be taken seriously after this.

This game turned from great to play to absolute garbage ....
Every match we get confronted with cheaters and thats only counting the obvious ones with aimlock and no recoil... nothing is being done about it ... they rather create some new skins and try to squeeze out people for some more cash ....
Wich i might add was the one thing they said they were never gonna do.... was fun while it lasted ... better try some other games guys and girls!

Date of Review: Just after patch #26, been playing since beta

Great game, let down by poor implementation. I've had a blast playing this game, nothing quite matches it in terms of making me jump out of my seat at times, but sadly in it's current form (over a year since beta ended and #FIXPUBG) it is riddled with bugs, clunky & clumsy movement issues, and just some downright dumb quality assurance problems (new patch removes a wall from a house - fine, simple enough change you'd think, but no, bluehole managed to forget about the hole in the roof it also removed, which can be shot through).

Played Vikendi with 2 others after patch #26, we all crashed once during the game and had to reconnect.

Please don't waste your time, wait for another dev team to release a competent version.
Everyone already knows about the high cheating base for this game. Here are some of the numbers:

Reddit post from Nov. 2018- https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/9la8b1/how_much_is_cheating_a_problem_in_pubg_is_it_as/

Article on the Chinese cheating player base percentage- 
https://www.dexerto.com/news/an-astounding-percentage-of-pubg-cheaters-come-from-one-country/44385

and the cherry on the top of what the anti-cheat approach-
https://segmentnext.com/2018/02/19/pubg-player-base-declining/

Multiple sources.
i dont recommend this game, because i always eat and sit, but i keep getting fatter... my carachter runs and runs (this is like running simulator) and i dont get fit why ?? .... thats a no no for me.
i was banned cause my account was hijacked and they did not give me my account back. If you get this game just be aware anything that was not youre fault can get you in trouble. I do not reccomend this game its great but the actual company is horrible in my opinion
Awful, bugged game ... so many years of development, so many money income, 1 year from the release .... and still almost not playable !!!! Still has huuuuuuuge desync ... Half an year from the release and they only masked this desync to be not so obvious ... They still don`t have servers ... I`m pretty sure that they didn`t even have REAL EU SERVER !!!!! I think the maps are made from 2nd grade students from artist school in China and they didn`t event talks between each other ... Just look at Miramar .... the whole map is on different color patches ... There is some edges which are invisible .... The rocks looks like every rock is from different game with different resolution :D .... I cant believe that this game made it so far !!! I don`t even want to talk about optimization :D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D:D it`s a mirage :D !!! I think this "gaming company" "B...hole" have only 1 team to work on this game and this team only makes crates and items to make some more money ... And may be 2 or 3 people really works for the game ... to make some patches with "fixes", which are only reworked bugs :D . BTW after some of those patches there are even more bugs :D ! BUT DIFFERENT ONES !!!! Like the latest you see the item but you cant pick it ... yep this is released game .... Ah or may be your cam just bugged and u cant control it :D .... and so on, and so on, and so on ... I can write whole night but now i`ll only say : DON`T BUY THIS SHITTY GAME, DON`T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS ME !!!!!!!!!!! DON`T DONATE ANY MONEY TO THIS COMPANY "B...HOLE", THEY WILL STOLE IT !!! DON`T BUY SKINS OR ANYTHING ELSE (for those who are f.ked up and already buyed this THING :D) !!!!!
I tried apex legends because it seemed like the hot new thing. Its not my bag as i dont really like the style of the game, but hot damn did it play well. Its been out for 3 weeks. ive put tons of hours into pubg and had fun, but fuck me if it doesnt play like a floppy bag of dicks. Its shocking how they cant fix the game. loot pickup is still broken, i struggle to get decent fps even on low settings and still get downed when im in cover because the hit registration is garbage. GG good potential, but horrible execution
Just get an Android emulator or Tencent's emulator then play PUBG Mobile. That mobile app is free but it's almost the same, some aspects are even better than this paid version of the game.

Imagine running on 60hz tick rate but not even perform half as good as CSGO's 64hz tick rate servers.
Headlines: Poorly optimised, sketchy netcode, dysfunctional anti-cheat, crash-prone, questionable developer business practices, boring & repetitive.. 

PUBG is an inferno of squandered opportunity, propelled by developer hubris and Chinese money. What started out as a promising game has degraded and fallen into increasing irrelevance. The game is plagued by huge amounts of downtime, lacklustre and unrewarding combat, and a punishing gear treadmill. What further ruins the experience are the aforementioned performance issues and rampant cheaters. Developer negligence to any of these issues has left the game stagnant, and superseded by games like CS:GO and Apex Legends. 

First and foremost the game is boring. One key issue that plagues PUBG is how huge the maps are, and how this creates a reliance on vehicles as there are no other transportation methods. In the standard 4 player mode it's common to find that you're unable to locate a vehicle that can transport all 4 players on your team, meaning 2 of you need to hoof it unless you can find a 2nd vehicle. 2-player vehicles just shouldn't be in the game, it adds to the huge amount of content-devoid downtime there is. 

_It is a very real possibility that you will never find a vehicle and you will be forced to sprint across huge open distances, in which nothing will happen._

When you're not looting, you're running or driving. It takes too long to get to a state where you're decently equipped. Equipment is _the_ ultimate decider in a firefight, not skill. A minimal amount of time per match is actually spent in combat with other players. Depending on luck, you might go through the majority of the match without firing a single shot, because you picked somewhere to go where the other players happened to ignore. This happens because, again, the maps are too large.

The developers are greedy and lazy, and unworthy of your support. Bluehole have the temerity to add loot boxes to an unfinished early access title. There are technical issues still prevalent in the game since PUBG appeared on Steam. It's a shame because PUBG could have been decent.
what are those new servers? im playing this game for 1 year and now the servers are way more bad than it used to be. where is the server settings? you could have pick your country server before like EU or NA
Garbage community, Ill probably be banned by the devs just for posting this review. You can get banned just for killing a twitch streamer. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR SUPPORT THIS DEVELOPER.
PUBG was supposed to be an awesome game.
But they have still not created a server for their Africa players.

WE still have to play with a ping of over 170 which is pretty impossible with this type of game play.

There have been petitions with over 15000 signatures requesting a server here as well as me sending numerous messages to the support team, all with the same response. They are aware and have sent the message onto the developers.

So if you are not in Europe, the States or Asia, dont bother buying this game. 

 ----- they should refund all the Africa players
So, after buying this your experience will be:
You've got good gear, might even call it great, you've have a good place to stay at, with lots of area coverage to make sure none flanks you.

Then why did you lose? Cause. The. Fucking. Game. Crashed.

Don't buy this game.
There are free to play games that put this game to shame in every aspect and it's still here charging $30 and still being a buggy, unpolished piece of shit.
ay we dont need skins, we dont need a lite version of this game . but we only need optimizing of your game
now i found the reasons why i hate bluehole and tencent
screw all of you

Honestly, has the potential to be the best BR out there, but it's just not. At all. Glitchy buggy horrible mess that only lags more and more with every update they do. I'm running this on a high spec gaming laptop and the frames are poor. The loot system is terrible, can jump into a busy area like School, Hacienda, Bootcamp etc etc and find nothing other than a machete, no attachments, no AR's just pistols. Lets be honest who want's to play a BR just to get sniped from 400 yards away on a hill whilst shooting at them with a handgun with no attachments? Nobody! I've racked up a fair few hours into this game just waiting for it to smoothen out, but that day has yet to arrive. Bleurgh, shame. Apex it is.
This garbage got Game of the Year? It isn't even remotely close to deserving that. Developer greed makes adding paid items a priority over them wanting to actually improve the game's sh*t performance and get rid of the hackers.  
Absolutely NOT recommended.
This game is literally a piece of garbage. If you want to get in on the stupid battle royal games play Fortnite and save your money for a real game...
If you like walking around for 20 minutes while picking up mediocre gear and eventually get shot by a sniper out of nowhere... this your game, go buy it now!
Disappointed to find out after such a long time of not playing this game and getting told that it has got so much better and its a new game all together basically that you still encounter a bunch of the same issues being busy servers which do not allow you to connect. I feel that in a full priced title this should not happen and would not recommend this to anyone else.
My BAD EXPERIENCE EVER AFTER H1Z1
I didn't play the game from a while! i decided to give it a try after update.
GOT BANNED without use any cheat or third party app! and the Customer Support reply are
"We apologize but there is nothing more we can do in this situation. Also, please understand that we cannot provide any exact details on what caused the infraction due to security reasons."
Not a fan. The controls are ok for the exploration and looting part. But combat mechanics and controls are awful when it comes to crunch time. Same reason why I didn't like The Division much. I like good third person shooters like Metal Gear Solid and FPS like CSGO. this misses the mark in both genres. Graphics are not as good as I expected either. Great idea. bad execution. refund pls
I don't hate this game, and it doesn't suck but it has one of the worst groups of developers out there. The fact that there are still people playing this game speaks a lot about how well they built this game for hardcore gamers but it is hard to be optimistic about this game's future when every step of the way the developers have shown how little they understand gamers and what they want and that the interests of the developers have simply been to make a product that will make as much money with as little investment as possible.
This game has had a long standing issue with connecting to servers from what I can tell, and it STILL ISNT FIXED. This game was updated really recently, being jan 30th, and nothing changed. we get some crappy weapon stats, some little things change, but this bug doesnt get fixed. Im not gonna pretend to know the quality of the game, seeing as my time in the game is so low, but i think the fact i CANT EVEN GET INTO THE BLOODY GAME IN THE FIRST PLACE speeks volumes about how LAZY the developers must be. You want the community to love your game? you want people to spend 40 F*cking dollars on your game? AT LEAST MAKE THE SERVERS WORK YOU INCOMPETENT NIMRODS!
During 10 hours of gameplay i got crashed twice, not to mention when i got higher kills and placement than usual. Got a pretty strong machine for this one, but random lags gets all over the place. Poorly designed system, slow loading, it isnt as flexible as it should be. You are waiting much more on the loading screen and before the match, than you play. Shitty weapons, cant hit the freakin enemy from 5 meters, but obviously he gets your head. Lots of noobs and u cant defend yourself against them, which means you loot yourself up but its unnecessary, because a stupid camper will kill you with a sniper you never find..Absolutely not worth its price. Buy something worthy than this money thirsty garbage.
I have been playing this game for over a year and a half now and i can say it's fun, but has massive flaws. The desync is still a thing nowadays and it's one of the most frustrating aspects of the game. Being killed behind objects because of ping difference shouldn't be a thing in a game that has made over 30 million sales. I gave them the benefit of the doubt thinking it was a time and managing staff issue since the company was still growing, but it appears it wasn't so. Pubg you have failed most of the dedicated playerbase.
IVE PLayed this game ever since it came out and have to say it is a disgrace that they make people pay for this crap shoot of a game. Ring of Elysium has fixed so much of what is wrong with pub g and it's beta it worth more than they are charging for pub g. If you really wanted to make pub g good you would follow the ROE example. your cheat detection is crap, your hit registration is crap, your movement fluidity is crap and no auto attachment seriously get real. I would never recommend this game to anyone and have actually discouraged about 5 people from purchasing it within the past 2 months. I continuously tell them to get ROE for free because it is a far superior game and to not waste your money on a game where people put in half effort on making it good and dont buy a game where the developers dont actually care about what their base thinks of the game. how about first off you fucking region lock this game to solve a huge portion of ping discrepencies. It is rediculous that I should have to play with people who have pings about 500 more than mine. It is not only not fair but absolutely rediculous. I will never recommend this game to anyone and will actively discourage anyone from purchasing it. The second Ring of Elysium (which is part of pub g so i dont understand what the rest of you knuckle dragers with your heads up your ass are doing) starts costing money to buy I will recommend its purchase as long as it keep not sucking like pub g does
After new Patch nothing change Car hits inviseble Rocks people still using Cheats do you actualy try to FIX THIS GAME people dont BUY THIS GAME there are by far beter games out there like Battle Royal
I love the experience this game delivers. The gritty survival aspect. The realistic and unique feel of the gunplay. The tense butt hole puckering firefights. It's a lovely game, when it delivers. I live on the side of the fence with players who never have a smooth game experience. From rubberbanding to full out disconnection, you would believe it if someone said they were using 56k to play.

Now, this boils the game down to usually one of two experiences overall. The game works, you play it regularly, and it provides as much joy as the amount of effort you put into it.

Or you get 1/10 games where your death didn't feel like it was based on technical issues.

Popular players generally sit on the luck side of gameplay,. However, if you watch a PUBG streamer for long, even they fall prey to this poorly optimized game.

It's truly a sad thing as well. This concept for a game is magnificent. Truly, there has been nothing like it before. Had the developers stayed the course, and not let the dollar signs misdirect them, this would be a game hailed as the next genre of FPS gaming. Instead what you get is an upset and toxic community, hit or miss copycats, and ridiculous moments like the pan lawsuit.

PUBG should've been a step forward for the next generation. A new Counter-Strike centered around intense strategy and precision skill. Instead we got a jumbled mess that has split the gaming community into a faceted wasteland for the time being.

That all being said, at least it's not Fallout 76.
-Terribly optimized  game 
-super expensive
-no one plays this anymore
-literally PUBG lite released and its super optimized . best part?
ITS FUCKING FREE (literally actually free)
well just another way to waste money
dont even get any perks in lite for buying this shitty overpriced game
just in case here is the link
https://lite.pubg.com/en/download/
This game is dead its not E-sports with no skill gap and pure rng this game is like other pay to win games because of the specs you need to buy to play it competitively
Great idea for a game. A shame that the development team cannot keep up. Too many available hacks, horrible game-play dynamics etc. would not recommend.
Once promising, but has ultimately failed to prevent tiresome frustration. It's Groundhog Day, just maybe in a different map every now and then - The sheep is always skinned after it's been sheared in the this best-selling product released by PUBG Corporation. Please add flamethrowers.
The worst game you'll ever play. Bought this game about a year ago, had fun at the beginning. Then every update made the game worse and worse. Don't waste your time here.
Played the game a bit with an FX-6300 and a GTX 750. Got around 50 FPS on very low. Meh.

Got an RX 570 8GB, got a consistent 90-100 FPS on ultra. Didn't play for a couple weeks, got back on and was only getting 30 FPS. Lowered everything down to very low and 70 3D resolution, down from 120 before. Get 40-50 FPS. Makes no sense to me. 

I wanna like this game, but sometimes it runs perfectly fine and other times it is absolutely terrible. Haven't gotten it to run any better since then.
Honestly, it gets kind of boring pretty fast. It's definitely a game to be played with friends otherwise you'd be hard pressed to find too much entertainment with the repetitive gameplay.

3/10
As the game has progressed it has gotten worse and worse, gave it another chance. Game crashed 2 out of the 3 games I have played. Overall piece of trash, DO NOT BUY
So im very new to the game. They place me in lobbies with people who have played for ages. Why dont you have servers based on skill. Yes i know im still a noob and have a lot to learn. In pubg mobiile you are put in servers based on your rank and skill. Why doesnt this happen here?
They recently broke the meta by adding flare guns. There are now planes flying constantly overheard drowning the game out with white noise and dropping L3 gear to heaps of people. Everyone kills eachother by mid game then the final circle everyone has L3. If you didn't crate chase you are at a severe disadvantage. Everyone has L3 Helmets late game making snipers useless. 

No reason to buy this in its current state.
I'm honestly a little dissapointed. It was such a promising game. Won the steam award, damn. I just bought it before. Played for about 5 hours and thought where did the OCE servers go. Litterally cannot find a game that has Australian servers. Supposedly it's because the playerbase is too small... bullshit. If that were the case, I'd rather have a matchmaking service throw me into a game with 30/100 players, than play a game with 100 players and 300 ping. Fuck I'm annoyed. This game is good. Just put me into fucking AUSTRALIAN SERVERS. Is that to fucking hard, bluehole? Epic Games did it before they were popular. Fix your game, I am going to play this game one more time and then I'm done. Might as well play Apex.
I really hope my review will change by this time next year. The Dev's have made some pretty big promises but I'll not hold my breath to see if they follow through. 
 
I've waited a very long time, over a year, for this game to fix itself. PUBG provides a gritty, realistic, pulse-pounding shooter that none of the other battle-royale games on the market have been able to replicate. Nothing feels quite like PUBG. But despite the excellent moment to moment gameplay, there is too much garbage that comes with this game. The hackers in every match, the inexcusable bugs, the practically non-existent content updates. I'm about done. I'm tired of watching someone who wasn't even aiming at me in the kill-cam hit every single shot they fire because they are either abusing region ping or flat out hacking. I'm tired of watching the free mobile game get everything from events, to temporary game modes, and hundreds of style choices while the PC version that I paid for gets nothing. I'm tired of the worst battle-royale loot and customization on the entire market. The god awful soldier crates, and then crates you can get for in-game currency but need real world keys to buy. Are you kidding me? Hours and hours in this game grinding to get one semi-decent outfit, half of which I coughed up real money for in the steam marketplace. Sure, they finally got around to bug-fixing in the past few months and hackers are rarer than they were six months ago but when I look over at games like Apex and Fortnite I can't help but feel frustrated. Why do free games have a better bug-free, hacker-free, functioning system than the one I paid for? Why do free crappy mobile game rip-offs of those games have better customization, loot, and progression than the one that I paid for? I was more than willing to give this game more time because of it's alpha and beta tags and I understood that meant that there would be a process of trial and error as things were added, fixed, and reworked. But the sheer lack of meaningful progress has left me frustrated. I cannot, in good conscience, recommend this game to anybody.
This is by far one of the worst games of 2019. They started out strong, showed promise, and were loyal to their players/community. But once hackers started coming in, they started to say screw it, lets just region lock people in asia. So now us Americans/Europeans/Asians(WHO AREN'T HACKING) who live in Asia can't play with our good friends we used to play with before region lock. I'd like to have a refund for this terrible game, the devs have gotten lazy and started to not care about us foreigners who live in Asia. Our voices matter, we deserve to play with a friends again without having them get high ping. 


Bluehole, more like Assholes, they've stolen our money. I deserve a refund. I'm tired playing with my friends who constantly die due to high ping, we used to have so much fun playing on a server where we would have the same amount of ping. Now its just a shit show for them. They die 2 seconds before they first shoot the enemies. I'm not playing in a random squad with random hackers in Asia. Its just sad and pissing me off, FIX PUBG! What happened to that promise last year? Bluehole, you should try and fix your shit, orelse its just going to go further down the drains and deep down to the black depths of the sea. Cause this is just annoying that you are not listening to us little guys(foreigners in Asia who are region locked because of the wrong doing of other hackers in Asia) Don't region lock, find a way to remove hackers completely, up your security.
Game still buggy and still very clumsy.

The game indeed has nice graphics. Can't argue about that. It does feel very static though. When you try to jump, you might still hit things around in the world, which will make you stop midways in the jump. When you want to lie down, your animation takes several seconds to do. There's no "Shit, I'm gonna die if I don't hit the fucking ground now!"-feel about it. No no - you character still has to bend down properly, before s/he can hold her weight with her arms. What the fuck?!

Also - whenever you watch your deathcame. The game is SOOO out of sync, that you think it's something that happened hours ago! The games I played after the last patch hasn't changed that a bit. I'm still not not visible on the deathcam, when I actually get shot, falling of a bike or anything.
If it's cheaters - then the developers should definately do something about it. If it's just bad coding - well - then the developers should definately do something about it. (Huh...? Feels like I'm repeating myself here?!)

So - can I recommend this game?
- Of course not. Not in it's current state. The 'wow'-effect has worn off, and it's time to actual do something about the game. Not just adding content anymore. Otherwise people will play anything else, but this game. Battle Royale is soon dead by the way - just wait... :)
When it first came out it had tons of potential, but with every update the game has gotten less optimized and less playable. Once finally getting into a game you will most likely be presented with random frame drops and game crashes, that have only gotten worse. I have an i9 CPU, 1080Ti, and Fiber internet. This is the only game I have these type of issues on and it seems the developers have given up trying to fix it.
I love pubg game play in all of it's broken dsync glory I have over $1000 hours in this game and I'm uninstalling and leaving this reviews because the people who run this game do not care about the people buying this game if you have a problem gfy enjoy the game is basically what your email will read..... pubg made a mistake then punished everyone who benefited from said mistake and they will not fix it and I will not fix it so after messaging with support I will never play my favorite game again based off of poor support and business management try out ring of elysum, Apex, fortnite, relm royal, h1z1 and more all of them are free compared to the $30 this game costs and they all run better than this game including apex...it launched better than pubg runs today
The game doesn't look good and is poorly optimized. It's very boring if you play buy yourself. The game has been in early access for a while and even after the official release, it still does not feel complete. The waiting in the game is what kills it.
wow..what a fucking game..I start the game....went to training mode..did some training...then update nvidia driver..restarted the game...and it says i've been banned...wow...fuck you asshole
ever since you guys region locked the game, the game has been ****ed we used to get 90~110 ms servers and now were being forced to play on 200~300 ping servers,people hould not buy this game. literally.
Absolute shit game that doesn't deserve any sort of reward. It used to have potential but now is just like any other cash grab, full of Chinese hackers and absolutely painful to play. Play a game that's actually good like Blackout or Apex Legends.
If you lives in Australia or NZ then do not ever buy this game because this game is region locked now and it will automatically select Asia server. I get 200+ ping on Asia server and give you great disadvantage over other Asian players.
This game sucks!! Battle Royal is not a new thing. Not sure why it took off like crazy with this buggy mess of a game! I'm personally not a huge fan of the game type because most of the game is a walking, driving simulator. If you are lucky you get some kills or even win, then its right back to walking and driving. Aside from my general dislike of BR, there are much better games in the genre. Now that Apex Legends is out and free, there is zero reasons to play pubg. Apex Legends and COD Blackout are far superior. And at least with COD, you get to play the regular multiplayer mode as well. Just say no to pubg!
Seriously, all the IT guys of the company need to be fired, the game is good but blue hole are just ruining it through every update with the lag, the optimized and the fps dropping. Let me tell you how i play two first games of the day after last update. Game 1: start matching, the loading screen apear, a few moment later i hear the sound of the plane, still the loading screen is there, and then i hear the parachute open, loading screen is still there, then i hear the sound of a perfect landing, and some footstep around me, the loading screen is still there and then boom, some one shot me in the head and i still don't even see any thing but the loading screen. Game 2, still the loading screen when the sound of the plane flying, patiently wait, oh there you go, now i see the plane, go, lets drop some where and pick some gun, after the landing, wow what the f***ck, where is all the building, they aren't even rendered yet, never mind just pick some gun, there's a guy right next to me. grap a gun, boom, fps dropped, boom, i die. Yep, good job blue ball, your "FIX PUBG" is really a thing, better call that "F...ck PUBG"
lol the fact this game is so popular shows everything that's wrong with the games industry. The lazy devs hate you and have no work ethic but somehow this garbage abortion of a game got picked up and published and is the most popular game on Steam still, making much too much money. Devs were too lazy to even make any of their own assets so all the buildings are just stock from the engine store and therefore the WRONG SIZE to shoot into/out of to have tactical use since nothing is scaled to the playermodel. I still don't understand why this game is popular because the devs half-assed everything and made no effort to complete front-end or back-end design. Why is an unfinished product being advertised so heavily?

This was a fun game to play with friends and a cool concept. However the technical problems like memory dump, extreme lag, hitbox bugs, cheating script kiddies, etc. made it not fun. Gameplay was more like Battlefield than a milsim like Arma. I'd rather play Fortnite, a game for children. 

I am thankful I got this as a gift from a gracious friend, who thought I would be good at this game from my hundreds of hours in Arma and Battlefield and am sorry I could not be a more combat effective teammate. I hate to blame the hardware but my 2gigs of vidram and wifi connection were not adequate to run this game competitively.
Game was in early access, they released micro transactions and a massive majority saw this as a bad sign, few of which jumped ship then. As time has gone on, the game has continued to devolve from a decent large scale multiplayer shooter, to a game about style and making money. nothing noteworthy has been changed, and nothing noteworthy aside from new maps has been added, after well over a year this game has just gotten worse and worse, and seeing it win game of the year "according to the steam community" has clearly given it far more backlash than ever. There were good games on that list, and then there was PUBG, there was only one game on that list that almost everyone came to a consensus with, and that was "PUBG should not win game of the year", yet it still has.
Dears VALVE...
Its a shame that you are letting so much cheaters playing PUBG.
Specially since we pay the game. Nearly every second game you bump into cheater who kills you through a wall or see where you are. I sometimes get raport about some ban but its not enough. 

Pls do something asap about that since you will loose many adult players who spend real money on your games.
Not that virtual from boxes or skins.
After this Im not sure I will buy soemthing from you.

So disappointed !!!!

They are making fools out of you and out of all of us who want to have fun and spend good time with friends....

Shame....it was promising but .....
So much money for PUBG to make modification and upgrades, they didn't , what a crap development team and founder. You even stop people from playing based on Regions, who the f are you to do that ? Now i end up with people with no mics.

Go Apex Legengs much more fun
>700 hours into game
>trys out Apex
>literally hasn't touched pubg since then, neither have friends


PUBG has a long way to go, especially since a great portion of the playerbase has switched to apex. Now, all the sweats who invested their lives into the games stay, making it hell for any new players to join, coupled with the fact it costs $30 and Apex is free. Servers need fixed, the weapon recoil shouldn't be so fucking harsh, the community is still toxic, thirsting is still prevalent etc etc
one of those games that had unlimited potential but let down by the greed, and mediocre developers. 
this game could have been so much better in so many ways if they had just added more content instead of giving us half assed broken garbage every 6 months.

1.My ping is too high because it merge and its servers do not change
2.looting, miramar and erangel base are very low compared to the past two years
3.FPS drops, due to a mistake in programming in the game
4.Please fix the anti-cheat
5. pubg not fix (fix.pubg.com) Are you sure?
I used to love this game! I remember those days when you could sneak into the forest and stay hidden for a while.. when players were running next to you and couldn't notice you! You needed your ears more than ever! But... that is just past...

Nowadays.. well.. Hackers are a regular presence! They don't even bother to disguise their aimbots! And if you are "lucky" enough not to find most of these so called "aimboters", it is quite impossible to go unnoticed! ESPs are such a common thing. That's why I understand (in some way) those top pro players... the ones caught cheating too. They were real good! But now they suck! And beeing easily killed by a newbie equipped with the right tools, it's kind of melodramatic. So they needed to leverage the situation! Poor guys!
And if you still don't believe me, then you must be smoking some magical stuff! Just check the Leaderboard! So many chinese nicknames! Ahahahha! Locked region? Oh.. I love VPNs (so they say!).

Well guys.. sadly.. I have to admit: this situation is out of control and should be a major problem for PUBG Team. Still.. I don't think they are addressing the problem the right way and/or doing enough to reduce it. 

So, I am out!
This game had a lot of potential in the beginning and that is one of the reasons why I have 423 hours in total on it. 
I was hoping to see at least some improvement but all I got was useless Battle Passes (I was dumb enough to buy them). 
Game has one of the worst optimizations that I have ever seen (besides Mafia 3). 
Vehicle physics is absolutely ridiculous.
There are tons of bugs and crashes in the game and you just gotta face that it will never get better. 
It is not worth 30 Euros, not even 20 Euros. 
If you really want to buy it, I recommend buying it on sale, but with plenty other Battle Royal games that are free at the moment I don't see why you would buy this.
4/10 This game is meh, definitely over hyped.  Unless you enjoy camping/hiding, discussing/looting boring items with the occasional instance of mediocre gun play that may/not briefly break the monotony of a glorified walking simulator, it's as much fun as going AFK in any other shooter.

If you're after a battle royal that rewards you for surviving (aka hiding in a room/camping/avoiding game play) more often then playing aggressively this might be your thing.  Meanwhile BF/COD game play is probably better off without you, so enjoy!

The most fun i had with this game was clicking the delete option in Steam
Fix the hit boxes and lag problems.  Tired of dying and watching the replay to see the dude not even get close to shooting me yet I somehow magically die.  My 18 year old copy of RTCW has better hit boxes than this POS.
It was good at first but after a lot of trash updates the company is killing the game by removing the things that are important and adding the things that aren't needed.
This game is terrible. Take it from someone with 1000 hours. 
It's buggy, not optimized, servers are trash, and the game is filled with hackers.
+ all the developers do is add cosmetics, not fix the game.
Excellent gameplay but the game feels unoptimized and crashes randomly at least a few times per month - something that only happens maybe a few times per year on CSGO.
Theres basically two ways to play this game :

1. Camp at one place for a chance to win. (No fun, better chance of survival)
2. Go fight and die early. (Fun, low chance of survival)
A few hackers go a long way toward ruining the game. Never has felt like the hacking or the bugs have ever quite been reigned in. 

Great concept, good execution in some ways.  Dying to hackers, or randomly queuing with teammate who is hacking just makes it feel like the game is a huge waste of money.  The game had a good life.  Don't buy it at this point.  It's gone the way of DayZ- tons of popularity for a while, but took too long to figure itself out.
I have my steam Account for more over 5 years, and i curse day that i decided to buy this game, but hey i cant reverse it anymore. For all those who are thinking about should they buy game, before you do you should go and do some research about it. I was unfortunate enough and went straight for it and now i'm punished for something i didn't done, but to cut this to important thing. If you are running AMD Graphics card you have like 50/50 chance that you will earn Perma ban because some drivers are buy passing their game files. And you will recive some alert on steam that Develoreps Perma banned you for invading their private policy, something along those ways. I was upset because i'm not cheater my self and my steam was flag'd as i am one of them. So i went for Their Support team and ask'd for help, but they only told me that i broke some Private policy and that is all when i ask if they could say what i done i got no replay. And those 5 years i spend are basically pope'd  on because they can. So here am i now if you wanna play game my word to you is : Game is amazing and really  enjoyable when playing whit friends but be ware because Game stuff members are Garbage and they wont give fuck..
Pubg is a heavily influential game. This cannot be denied due to how it popularized the BR genre. However, Pubg is so poorly optimized that I cannot recommend it. The gameplay is fun enough but there is no reason that you should be paying for this when there are games that are both free and considerably better.

Note: I received the game as a gift. I was not compensated for playing this in any way.
The game itself is fun, but be warned, you  risk losing whatever you invest in this game to a poorly implemented anti cheat. That is also coupled with poor customer support. Bluehole has no accountability on the matter and will not communicate or work with you to resolve issues. Their tactics are elementary level, and I mean that literally. Like a 2nd grade child they stick their fingers in their ears, call you a doo doo head, and refuse to even acknowledge your cries as they kick you in the shin until you fall over crying. I do love the game itself, but the people who own it... I think I have explained my experience. Think big cable and South Park and that's PUBG Corp/Bluehole...those nipples still  have some miles on them it seems...
I have a love-hate relationship with PUBG. On one had I really like the gun play and the environments. On the other hand the movement is janky, the game is buggy, and the devs gave up on making actual updates so they could add loot crates that only dispense 4 different colored jeans. At this point it seems all the devs do is try to build up hype around meaningless updates so they can sell a few more crates.
Runnig this on a high end pc and my frames drop whenever they want below 50. Basicaly unplayable, no wonder why it got outclassed by fortnite and now apex. Worst 30 euros of my life!
I used to be goated in this game u hrd, but u know chinese company buys the developer and game goes to dog nice game btw i have a 1080TI and i still get 40fps on this game no wonder i dont play this game anymore, no wonder fortnite killed this game
it was a great game before, but after bluehole with tencent make some shitty games (like PUBG Mobile, and PUBG lite) and its free, everyone play them, why ?, bcoz its free, u dont need to spend your money at this shit game anymore, you kill your own game bluehole, tq for everything bluehole...

don't buy it, you can play for free with PUBG lite and PUBG Mobile, believe me, you will regret if you buy this game...
Do not buy this game. matchmaking takes forever. quick match only opens in vikendi or sanhok. miramar and erangel does not load in any mode. tried wating 10 min once. migrating to apex or other game but never pubg again
Vikendi +1,000
Hackers -1,000,000
Lost OCE servers -1,000,000
Reduced performance -1,000
Season length and pass cost -500,000
No china region lock -500,000
--------------------------------
Final score -3,000,000 pts Avoid until fixed
I don't leave reviews often but this is a special case. PubG recently Ban me for no reason they didn't provide any evidence and I hardly play the game anymore. I can't recommend this game to anyone due to the fact that the game is a buggy mess with a ton of hackers and its funny how they  ban me forever as a legit player. Plus don't look to the ticket support for help they will just call you a liar and say they can't do anything to help.

3/10
how come this is game of the year 2018... it was released in 2017, early access IS a release, isn't it? 

on to my review, 

game is done so much better by other companies... for free.
PlubbityKnubbity Blurrbity is, or maybe I should say "WAS", the poster child for the Battle Royale genre. If you want Patient Zero for the genre, this is a good place to start. It's also a good place to start if you're looking for something that has had years of development and bank-fattening amounts of money thrown at it, but has gone in circles at the best of times.

A buggy mess of semi-finished mechanics, non-functional anti-cheat, technical issues that would make one-man teams cringe, poor optimization, and aggravating gameplay.

While the game is very tense when things go kind of quiet, it's not the fun kind of tense. It's the kind of tense that'll wrack your nerves and make you constantly triple-check your surroundings just to make sure you didn't overlook that sniper. Then you'll probably stumble across said sniper by accident and get your brain splattered against a wall as he does a sudden 120-degree flick headshot that breaks your full-durability helmet and still kills you.

I'm not even going to go into depth about the lootboxes and the battle passes, because everyone and their dog has torn the game a new one already for it.

Simply put, I don't "get" PUBG. Matches last long enough to drag on into boredom, but also end in seconds, which feels like a slight betrayal of time. I got some decent hours out of it, but it's not much compensation when I ended each match a nervous wreck and didn't have any fun.

I'd recommend going elsewhere for your Battle Royale needs, or just playing a less-buggy first-person shooter.
this game was half bad with the lag spikes, cheaters, and glitches. now this game is terrible with the desync. like come on. you're behind a wall on your point of view, but not even hidden on the opponents view? shit gets old real quick.
This game is not worth $20, so it's not worth $30. The odds of it working are slim. It's extremely buggy, and too poorly made. The optimization sucks, and even on high looks bad. All that playing this game does to me is make me wanna play CSGO, which by the way, is now free. I mean... if you have friends that play this game, and you wanna play with them, then sure get it, if your pc is good, it would be fun that way, but if you're on your own, it's not worth it.
Pubg was a good game "was" the lag is just ... its not like in dota or warcraft  the point of the game is to "shoot other players" but with the lag well ITS IMPOSSIBLE  but if blue hole fix this the game might still find its way up the list of most popular games.
Owning this game since release was a good way to notice how much lack of detail and content that should've been added within 2 years of this game being at its highest peek. Massive bugs and glitches galore and still fps issues im hearing from alot of ppl sadly this is a dead game filled with EU/Korean players since the game was made in South Korea everyone there is able to access a free copy since it was leaked. Im glad to say I sold all my skins and uninstalled after having it on my pc for 2 years.
After playing PUBG on my Android phone for about six months and liking it I thought the PC version would be a winner. Wrong! The mobile version is way more fun (better menu system and more intuitive controls) but more importantly, runs much better. The PC Steam version is sooo glitchy. Most times I end up stuck in the air floating on a parachute and not able to even land on the ground. I have a few clips of this.

Also, you need a top spec PC to really run this game. In my opinion, the minimum specified 8GB is not enough. Also, you will need a super fast internet connection or there really is no point buying this game! My internet connection is pretty decent but was getting a lot of lag anyway.

Going back to the mobile version, you can use settings to automatically pick up a specified amount of items. So for example, you can set it so that you pick up 250 rounds of a specified type of ammo. All you do is run/walk over the ammo and you automatically pick it up. Once you get to the specified number, you wont pick up any more. You can do this with med kits, cans etc. In this version, you have to individually point to and pick up items (by pressing a button). This makes game play really tedious and takes away the fun. Developers! 

Another point - in the mobile version you get little footprints appearing on the map when you hear an enemy approaching. This is useful as you can home in on direction easily, making game play more fluid. Your team mates' footsteps will not appear on the map in this way. Also useful. In the Steam version there is no way to tell which audible footsteps are whose meaning you have to focus a lot more. I think this makes it less fun. Leave all that tactical stuff to Tom Clancy. The same applies to gunshots, in the mobile version your enemy's gunshots are marked on the map, giving you a rough direction (unless they are using a supressor). Developers!

One more thing - you will get head shot ed through a wall by someone using botware (cheating!). I think they are now trying to clamp down on cheats but there are still loads for sure! This does not really bother me that much. What does bother me is the numerous glitches and tedious game play!

As other people have said, this has a lot of potential. Good graphics, good sounds, smooth action (when it actually works), nice concept etc. As of right now however, I would like a refund and to uninstall this lame duck of a game. Stick to the much better PUBG mobile on android. Try it, you will see what I mean. 



Even after being out for a long time it's still buggy, it's not well made enough to be as 'Hardcore' as it wants to be. The shooting mechanics feign at being great, but they're poor. It's still packed with hackers and it's just not fun.
This game is just generally terrible, if you wanna not pop a blood vessel from the amount of bad hit reg, broken game mechanics or just all around instability and bad quality of life details. Just dont play this game.
this game is really bad. I got banned without any reason even though when I played rainbow six game with the same anti cheat system was not banned, only the PUBG was banned and I could not return my account.
There aren't enough game modes to make it worth it anymore. The only players left are the tryhards and blue zone bandits. It was good while it lasted, time to play something else.
Played this game a lot in early access days, back when random ctds were all you had to worry about. It had lots of bugs then, but it was still a fun game to play with friends. 

Took a break, then came back after they launched 1.0... still had some bugs (but it's a former early access title what do you expect) only now it had the added bonus of rampant hacks. After some research found that the devs it wasn't as big of a deal and instead added more tradable items and keys to the game.

Took another break then saw it get the Steam Awards 2018 GOTY. My friend reinstalled the game and I watched him play a few matches... even more hackers. I was then glad I didn't waste disk space reinstalling it to play with him. We then looked at the nominees for the GOTY and concluded that the Steam Awards is now broken and it's AI should be repaired or a majority of Steam users who voted are masochists.
First of all I´d like to make clear that i don´t want to ruin anyones experience and i am not judging anyone who likes the game. Even tho you must be f-ing mental.
After almost 2 years they still haven´t fixed the major issues in the game like just for exapmle the fact that you sometimes get damage because of landing on an uneven surface. 
Or the terrible jump and climbing mecanism. If you want to escape a situation in which you need to climb a certain wall, u better pray it works in the first or second time. Because mostly it does not.
Also the  Netcode is still a joke and can easily be compared to some of the older Battlefields. 
The only thing PUBG Corparations seems to care about is their monetization with mircotransactions and all the Bug fixes around that. Which should give you a clear image of their intensions. Their only goal seems to be to get as much money out of this game as possible until it dies because of simply better products like Apex or Fortnite which are free to play and way less buggy.
They obviously do not care about their playerbase at all and  don´t even try to hide that fact. The last 12 GB patch proves that.
Another joke are the microtransactions which are as bad as in every free to play game. 
I´m not gonna lie, I´ve had some fun momets playing the game with friends. But lets be honest, you can create your own fun with friends in almost any game which costs less than PUBG.
I really don´t recommend buying this game anymore. I would not even be surprised if they made it free to play at this point and f´uck anyone in the a´ss who paid for this "game". 
Save your money or buy another game. You would regret paying 30 bucks for it.
If you like buggy games this one is just right for you! You'll probably enjoy the FPS peaks for no reason, crashes, cheaters, increased ping, poor match making, poor item and map load, and be forced to play it on very low settings because there's no PC good enough for it.

The development team, worked hard enough to be sure that you have a great and pleasant buggy experience.

This is simply a bug, I can't even call it a game, it's just a BIG FAT FPS BUG. So enjoy it!!!

- Weekly 4 hours to 7 hours maintenance to add more bugs
- Updates every week to add more bugs, FPS, ping, cheaters, so you have a blast.
- Vikendi, a map where the player with less FPS wins, but if you're one of the lucky ones that gets stuck under the stairs you can win it all!! :D
- New unbalanced gaming so you can s... even the PROs!
- New cheaters! The only reason they are banning people is because cheaters will probably PAY AGAIN!

Now, if you don't like bugs, you like quality and great games, just move forward, I can tell you this game isn't for you, I thought it was for me, but with time I loose hope on seeing any improvement. The development team, is clueless, and I think the CEO of the company even more.

My system:
Windows 10 Pro 64-bit
16.0GB Dual-Channel DDR3 @ 662MHz (9-9-9-24)
Intel Core i7 4770K @ 3.50GHz
2047MB NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 6GB (ASUStek Computer Inc)
465GB Samsung SSD 850 EVO 500GB (SATA (SSD))
A simple list why you shouldn't buy PUBG:
 1. Greedy devs
 2. Poor optimization
 3. Early access/sloppy gameplay
 4. Hackers out the ass
 5. Your success in the game relies heavily on luck, whether you find good loot in a reasonable amount of time or you run into other players with better or worse gear who could easily wreck you if you didn't get lucky enough.
 6. At times devolves into a "Running Until Getting Shot in the Head" simulator.
Easily The Slowest Most Unresponsive Game I Have Ever Laid My Fucking Eyes On! I Can Not Believe I Have Invested Over 2000 Hours In This Game!  After Playing Apex Legends And Realizing What Ive Been Missing... Its Incredible.. I Can Actually Open A Door Or Pick Something Up When I Want Too.... I Can Actually See My Character Respond To The Movements Immediately... Takes 17 Seconds In Pubg To Equip A Measley Fucking Backpack... The Devs Behind This Game Should Be Fucking Ashamed.. I Know Niggas In Prison Who Have Created Better Responsive Games Than This.... I Am Just Fucking Disgusted That A 2500 Dollar Computer Cant Run This Game Smoothly... Motherfuckers Peeking Around Trees Like They Havent Seen A Chiropractor In Their Past 5 Lives.... This Game Is Absolute Ass....
This game is so unbalanced and unpredictable, honestly, a single dude can just come out of anywhere and they just mow you down along with all your team mates in 2 seconds, further than that the audio mixing, especially the footsteps is so broken, my teammate is walking next to me but sometimes the game just decides to throw a random footstep sound outside or across an area thus juking me into giving false info that i heard someone elsewhere
game that cost me nearly 30 bucks cannot be even compared with free to play game.... 16 GB RAM, 8GB GPU, i7 and still fucked up optimization....fuck you all game developers and fuck your moms and also your shit content..... FIX/OPTIMIZE THE GAME FIRST... how is it possible to be so fucked up since the release date... this was my life lesson never buy a game that is in alpha or early access because they only drain money from you...AGAIN......FIX THE FUCKING GAME YOU FUCKS!!!!!!!!!
If you want a great Battle Royale experience, go get Apex Legends. A Triple A title made by Respawn, the people who made Titanfall, that is the only Battle Royale game to be fun, and not be in Early Access.

Don’t buy this, it’s for your own good.
gtx1060, i7 and 12 gb of ram and still this game is fucking unplayable.
Start match. Loading screen. "hear footsteps", still loading screen, hears plane, still loading screen. Finally at the end of the map it loads. Okay maybe if im fast enough to loot and find... texture non loaded and im floating the in houses stucked. Still manage somohow to not die and  run to the circle. last 8 man and you have killed nothing. See a guy, shoot the guy.  loot the guy and game crush. 
A third disistall is forever bluehole. fuck you, enjoy my money
For a good amount of time [i]PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds[/i] was the only "good" battle royale with a more "realistic" military setting. It had its fair share of issues - and still does - but I was able to look past that because there was not a better battle royale game on the market. I would have recommended it a year or two ago.

Now, in 2019, I would argue that there are many better and more promising options available. Time has afforded [i]PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds[/i] some luxuries - the game has a good amount of weapons, vehicles, and maps; at least in comparison to its rivals. Sadly when I play [i]Battlegrounds[/i] I find myself wanting to play other, better battle royale games. There are games that perform better, with better core mechanics, with more fun features, some with a better price tag. I do hope that PUBG will, sometime in the future, fix persistent issues and add some much needed quality-of-life features. However, as of now I feel I cannot recommend it.
After putting so many  hours i think its time for me to leave a review I am sick of this game now. It was so much fun in the beginning when I first started playing with friends. Now I can't even play solos without worrying about hackers. I didn't mind hackers back then but after so many patches and years of updates you can't can't get battle eye to work to ban hackers. I don't see a point to play your game anymore. Your rank system is legit garbage too it doesn't mean anything. I'm sorry but even the pros are not playing this game anymore so good luck pubg you used up alot of my time and you are just not worth it anymore.
You'll you it if your really really good at shooters. If you aren't don't buy this. Everyone else has the skill of a goddamn navy seal or something. Don't get me wrong it's beautiful game but only buy it if you're good in shooters.
I bought this game back in April of 2017, it was enjoyable then even with the server issues it had. Though, at least then the guns seemed to work properly, I played with people who spoke my language, and there wasn't nearly as many cheaters.

The success of the game seems to have went to the heads of the development team, and all they really add now is customization options for people to shell out more money, things that were in event modes, or vehicle & weapon reskins. Though on occasion we do get lucky and get something new like a map, take that as you will.

I still get some enjoyment out of this game occasionally when I happen to get into a lobby without a cheater. Though this isn't nearly as much as I once could due to the issues above.
Why is it that this game still crashes? how hard is it to put a little effort into the programming of this game so that it doesn't crash? Figure your sh*t out. Figure your god damn sh*t out, and fix this f*cking game
For a game that is solely about shooting other players this game has some of the worst feeling weapon physics I've ever experienced in a shooter. Seeing how the game has "evolved" (not much at all) during the past year I doubt it will never be at a point where it feels satisfying. Movements feels sluggish and people are bullet sponges. And sure, I've had some fun in this game, but it's more of a "fun with friends" type of deal which doesn't say anything about the game really. I could probably have "fun with friends" while watching paint dry, or playing Fallout 76. 

How did this win that GOTY Steam award again?
As a kid this was the game I would dream about. Deaths that matter, sneaking, looting, amazing sounds that reveal enemy positions and from time to time the opportunity of amazing team shoot outs during car chases. This is exactly how I love battle royal.

So when the game got popular I got very excited, the game was far from finished, but with all the money they could fix all the issues easily and make the game better than ever! I was 100% convinced this was gonna be my new counter-strike if it would get a good competitive mode.

The devs focused however on different things. New content, new platforms the game would be released on and let's not forget: new ways to milk money out of the people that would come for the said above new content. Not as I would have wished to see things go, but whatever, there are different people with different skills working on different things in the game, so as long as they would fix the issues as they promised....

For a long time I withheld writing a negative review, things looked promosing and improvements definitely have been made. But the thing is: the game is still a mess to this day. Just to give you a tiny snippet: low framrates, laggy servers, rubber banding and floaty feelings, awfull GUI's and that all in an overall ugly game. I don't like Fortnite at all, PUBG is my kind of battle royal, but I'm glad they snapped the crown as PUBG absolutely doesn't deserve it.
Terrible game.  I don't believe in regrets. Yet I find myself regretting the 30 bucks I spent on it and the 33.2 hours I spent playing (getting killed by hackers and lagging all over the place) it.
I just uninstalled cuz its so trash, i mean, shooting correctly the hole mag into somebody and he's still able to turn around and kill me with 3 bullets? but where are my bullets going 150 fps  30 ping? so trash
This game is best game at 20018????? u fXXk kidding me. it has enough fun i know, but.. the best at 2018?? serious ??even  the assets is from EPIC store , can not believe this.
e sports ready? seriously? like seriously, this broken piece of software has been "e-sports ready" for over a year and its still a buggy, lagging crashing game. its like driving the one car of your mate that got his last inspection about 5 decades ago. Its unstable, its not very fun and you are always on the edge of your seat cause you are scared the whole damn thing is gonna fall apart on every corner. just forget this game at this point. go outside, do something with your friends and just stop playing this abnoxious insult of a game.
Okay guys, will try to be short as I can... Was playing this game for 1.5 years, in the beginning this really was fun even with lags, bugs and insane frame drops as I there was this meaning in my head that developers need a bit more time to fix all and get possibly the best game ever on its highs. I have pretty good PC setup with 2x 3.6 ghz Xeon (8 cores totally 16 threads) + 1080Ti and 48GB of RAM, but the performance pain on low graphic settings has never gone and after some updates it was even worse. Instead of fixing performance problems, Bluehole decided to put new Battle Passes millions of skins and MEGA LAGY WINTER MAP + other shit. To understand my case - with my setup in average I was getting around 55-65 FPS in this game and it never get better even after million forum threads and hundreds youtube videos about how to optimize the PC to get better performance - Bluehole WTF is this??? So to play your game without insane frame drops (20-25 FPS) in beginning action (Pochinki), I have to upgrade my gear putting in more hundreds $$$ and feel happy finally??? No! I'm done with this sh*t, to be honest. I don't think there is another game on youtube, that has such amounts of optimization guide videos like PUBG has. I'm just tiered and done with this game... And for example - I run APEX on max Video settings and getting solid sable 100+ FPS..., this is how game has to be made in core. 
Never think I'm going to post review like that, but I had to.
THIS GAME IS UTTER SH1TTT. campers everywhere - this is the only way to play - hide and camp . DO NOT BUY THIS , worthles, I'M RETURNING THIS AND GETTING REFUND
There are no such thing as Oceanic servers for this game anymore, I don't care if I have to wait 5 mins for a server to fill up whilst on the island but at least give us the opportunity to try. 

The game is currently dead and not supported for a huge part of the world.

Link below basically explains the whole story.

https://thespinoff.co.nz/games/06-10-2018/the-six-month-bug-that-killed-pubg-down-under/
The gun play is absolute dog s**t, do not recommend if you like realistic weapon handling. Foot steps are impossible to hear unless you're at 100% volume. Needs to be optimized. Many bugs.
Spent countless hours in this crap hole hoping that they would fix it. Its just a giant buggy mess. Spend 30 minutes to run around get the best guns then get sniped from across the map by someone you cannot even see nor hear. Fun game. 0/10 would not give a crap.
Game of the year 2019? no, just no. It has moments of fun but honestly is hampered by STILL poor optimization and having lootboxes. Monster Hunter World deserved this title the most out of any of them, then maybe hitman 2 or assassins creed odyssey which i heard isnt terrible.
I bought this game back when it was in early access and for a little while it was fun but that wore off pretty quick. pubg has improved since then but it's not nearly as good as it could possibly be. apparently Bluehole thinks that spending time trying to shove microtransactions down the community's throat, trying to (and failing to) sue Fortnite and releasing half-baked version of the game on Xbox is more important than actually spending time trying to improving the game because the shitload of money they've made is simply not enough for them. fellas if you want to try Battle Royale, trust me, you got better options out there.
For every patch, the developers of this game are introducing more bugs than they fix. My most recent experience with a game crash left me with 15 fps after reconnecting, making me useless to my team and ruining a game we had a chance of winning. FPS for me drops every single patch. There is no excuse for this kind of uselessness.

If you like playing a game that feels like it will leave beta in 3 years (despite being "ESL ready"), play PUBG. Otherwise pick one of the much more polished experiences available.
If you enjoy ramming your appendage against a belt sander while pouring gasoline onto it and then lighting it on fire you will enjoy this game because it feels the same way only 10x worse.
THE WORST GAME I HAVE EVER SEEN
WHO FIRST FIND GUN WIN
ITS FUCKIN NOT FAIR 
YOU WANT PLAY BUT SOME KIND OF NOOB FIND WEAPON AND KILL YOU BECAUSE YOU WITHOUT GUN
Worst game of all time.

29.99 for this crap? It's not developed well, crappy gameplay, bad optimization. It's not even worth 29.99. And it's boring by the way. Seriously, don't buy it.
It's just bad....Can play almost every current game on 80+ fps, but when it comes to pubg? 2fps all the way....Movement's shit and clunky, takes 6 years to load any textures....dont even bother, just got and play fortnite lmfao
Apex Legends is far superior in every way. This game is infested with hackers, poor performance, and overall just an under developed sloppy game compared to Apex.
Fucking trash game that no one plays anymore. Let me down cause they lost to fortnight cause they never fixed there broke ass game. Laggy and glitchy. They just trying to play catchup to every other Battle Royale, they deserve the fate they got, a shit tier game that no one cares about anymore. If your considering revisiting the game or trying for some reason, don't. The developers don't need any more money to waste on hookers and drugs like they did when pubg was actually relevant. Only people who play this game anymore are hackers and the retards that spent hundreds of dollars on cosmetics and are invested. Go play a fun game the developers actually support
Honestly, this game had opportunity, but it was wasted. This game is almost unplayable and the dlc in this game is laughable.
Don't waste your time with this garbage.
this game is full of crash bugs,lag is really common even i have really stable connection , game crash every one in 10 games and I think it is a rule to crash during a stand off. Really fun game,very good idea ,I enjoy the concept . But the game is just so unreliable. Hope they can fix it, there is still hope i guess, but I would not recommend for 30 bucks
The year is 2019. You are still playing PUBG instead of Apex Legends for some unfathomable reason. You don't understand why your internet friends no longer speak to you, and constantly appear offline on all game platforms. You quietly watch PUBG load up again after crashing for the fifth time in an hour. You load up Twitch while you wait for a game to see if your favorite streamer has finally gone back to playing PUBG after marathon streaming Apex Legends every day for 18 hours a day all week; they haven't. You stare at yourself in the mirror. All your clothes are ridiculous looking, and your haircut is horrifying. You have terrible taste, and it doesn't just show in the games you play. 

You get out of your chair and hop on your Segway to go down to the store, but the Segway ends up taking control of itself and driving you out your window, crashing to your death. As it turns out, much like PUBG, the Segway had been totally compromised by Chinese hackers. Nobody attends your funeral.

This game is trash.
PUBG is a garbage shit game. I havent played in at least a year or more but I realized I didn't review this piece of shit game when I purchased it. The servers are absolute shit and BLUEBALLS cares more about skins and tourneys than anything. I was happy to see the SHIT score PUBG has when I came to Steam, heres to it going further down, fuck you PUBG
It's just a mess of bugs and cheaters. This game can be defined with two words: Inconsistent and unreliable. Nothing actually works as intended, and now there are better free options out there like Apex Legends. The game can not be fixed so it makes no sense to ask the devs for that because they simply cant. Player base is going down because the game is a mess and devs only want more and more money. The Vikendi pass was an absolute SCAM, with missions designed to make you pay for levels. You will never see the player base go up again, this game is dead but it will be a slow one because it was the first one to succeed in this genre but it doesnt make it a good game.
GARBAGE.  Crashes my computer, $150 headphones dont work for this game only and its buggy as shit...
The game will not start and now crashes steam... lol
I hope Epic puts these scrubs out of business.
This game has fallen far. The game has always been uncomfortable to play. The Dsync and cheaters have always been a factor, but only in the last months has it become unplayable. 

Everyone I know who tries to play this game experiences 7-20 minute matchmaking times, terrible bugs that often make getting into the match impossible, and 200+ ping in every game (We used to get 80 at most).

Play Ring of Elysium instead. That game actually works.


The community so toxic. I don't even play this game, even i got it for free. It didn't catch my interest. Then one day, this dam hacker from god knows where hack my account, to play this dam game. He play it for a bout 3 hours ( i knew because i only play it for about few minutes, then i got bored.) Not only this hacker play using my account, he also get me GAME BANNED. Now i got this dirty red banned word on my profile.

0/10.

Most cancerous community on steam. Save yourself from getting banned even though you didn't play it.
This game is about as good as it is bad.   If it actually decides to work for you your golden, but if it decides to crash and refuse to run properly like it does for me 24/7 then don't waste your money.   On top of that its got this weekly "server are too busy".   I would "NOT", I repeat, NOT recommend this trash game.
I am having fun with the game i did encounter with a cheater one time BUTTT the fucking microtransactions/crates are horrible the worst progression i ever seen in game(i know there are worst but this is one of them), even if it is just cosmetics they could do way more better, after all this game is not ftp ,if they fix it i may rereview it cause this game can be good.
it doesnt take a scientist to know this game sucks, from time to time i try playing it but i can never get into games and when i do i get killed by something small (which normally i'm fine with) and then have to wait another 5 mins till i get into another game, also when i play it struggles to get around 60 players out of 100
The worst company in the whole world. You basically have to download the whole on each update. The graphics quality is awful even when playing on max settings. The audio effects are bad. When you are making one step it sounds like you ran 100 meters. Bugs with collision detection. Also I would like to mention that when I bought the game (which was while it was in BETA), AFAIR there was an announcement that they won't lower the price even when the game is published, so people won't feel used, but as you can see that is was not the case.
It is a shame really, since the the game is fun to play, but it isn't a good value for money
Every time I run an update on this game, SOMETHING always goes wrong and am unable to ready-up into a game.
Verifying game integrity is probably the safest bet to a fix (if all of your other Steam games work), but even then, it's a hit or miss.

It has the potential to be a great game, but the developers are half-arsing every single step of the way and are doing a tremendous job in pissing a lot of loyal pubg followers off the face of this universe.

Apparently the devs are "understaffed" and can't afford to hire any more staff, yet, we have one douche-pot from the higher org who owns numerous highly expensive cars and continually ignores the customers' requests to JUST.MAKE.THE.GAME.WORK. 

Truly disappointed. Would demand some kind of rectification, but we all know they ain't gonna do squat.
Get the game if you want to sit in the loading screen for hours on end. Get the game if you want a pubg wallpaper...
never even consider downloading this game

full release, full off hackers, full with errors, crashes all the time, downtimes poorly communicated.the game is just horrible. 

WORST BATTLE ROYALE EVER MADE
So I'm just gonna stop playing this game, they ban my brother for no reason, a "Game Ban" by the developers not a vac ban, an he dosn't hack at all, just got reported to many time cause people are salty. they don't even review the cases they just hand out bans an get people to buy the game again so they can keep making money. this is bull shit game, loved it but with new games coming out there going to lose a lot of players if they keep this crap up.
This game is great. The guns, graphics, feeling of the sounds and the gun fire, everything feels nice. The problems with this game is its developers, there is a lot of things that can make the game new and better such as moods levels etc, but the only thing the developers are thinking about is how to use us the customers or players of this game and make money from us in crazy ways. I find this disrespectful, a coat just a damn coat is for 8USD$ not to mention the crate keys.. everything is for money. Feels like they don't care if you played or level up. The content is just poor. A lot of things could've been better with this game but sadly the developers don't care about making it better or more fun, no, they only think about how to make more money out of our asses. The game needs a lot of working and in my opinion the mobile version is better because they gave a much better content of the game in a short time than the original pc game.
Amazing game, piss-poor optimization. Doesn't matter if i'm running it on Ultra, or on Medium, there's still 2 or 3 second long freezes if i'm driving a car too fast, abysmal load times, crusty anti-aliasing.
Pretty fun but I have encountered cheaters pretty much every play session of 2019. The game does feature an easy to use reporting function, but that obviously doesn't keep people from cheating, just reduces the damage they do. Play if you want to help a poor cheater feel good for killing you when your position was on his screen the whole time.
Since last update my voice chat not working 
I have tried validating the game file 
Reinstall the game 
Reinstalling the window 
Gone through mic setting
Updated drivers also seen the in-game settings 
It's like the first min voice mute no one can hear me I cannot hear anyone
I tried restarting the pc and the game for couple of times but nothing seems to 
Work it's a major bug for some of us pls help. 

"Battleye Timeout query" has been affecting users since at least June 2018 and is still around.

But hey they will always make sure theres a lot of cosmetic junk that you can buy with real cash, its top priority for them
* crashes, crashes, crashes!
  every 2 matches you should expect a game crash
  i have been playing this game for almost 2000 hrs and i've tried every single thing you can imagine, new windows, new drivers...
* Nvidia 1070, i7 6700HQ
* lately crash-reporter itself crashes while trying to send crash report to pubg corp.
* there is a big gap between players and support team.
* after a year pubg devs have decided to encrypt UDP packets knowing that raw payload can make the game vulnerable to packet sniffing(RADAR HACK) and now that they have encrypted it's most likely useless because having the raw format of payloads make it easier to  decrypt...
* like 50% of players use mouse and keyboard macros without any consequences
= if you wanna have fun for like 10 hrs a week, pubg is a great choice, but trust me you dont wanna play it competitively.
After the initial fun, the shine wears off and reveals a hot mess. The server performance, client optimization, and developer are all very disappointing.
Waste of money, It seems every time I want to play this game theres a server issue or connection with steam issue its just broken trash If I could refund I would
Update after update.... after update after update...... and yet nothing really changes. I hope you don't live in Australia because you'll never actually be able to play. If you're going to improve the game with continuous updates you could at least be fixing bugs and improving play-ability. It's not worth it anymore.
Every time i get near end game "Network Lag", leave and try to rejoin gives "Not Authorized".
Thought I would see if they fixed it after a year. Nope.
Only restart game fixed it, but since always at end game I die to blue zone since pubg takes a year to load on my enthusiast machine.

Rediculous. This game will annoy you more than you will enjoy it,, stay happy and play a game that gets fixed instead.
Fun concept, great for casual gamers, but horrible problem with hackers, bugs, awful tickrate/desync, and other small issues stack up to make it anything but competitive.
The game is ripe with bugs and the devs have shown little to no interest in fixing them. This game almost feels less playable than it was when it came out.
Great concept and Graphics but poorly optimized. PUBGCorp please fix. I used to play the game more than ever before frames started affecting your overall dps. Stop adding new stuff and cosmetics and fix/optimize the game. PUBG Mobile is actually doing better than the PC ver because Its optimized.
Simple. If you play in asia, you can kill, enemies cannot kill you, u get banned, u contact battleye, they ban u, game developers ban u. so fuck u battleye and pubg and the people.
The idea behind this game is fantastic, but the execution is absolutely horrible. It has been officially released for months now, and it is still receiving 10+ GB patches weekly. Since I've bought this game, the amount of patches far exceeds the game size itself. The game itself requires 30 GB of space, and I just now had to download a 12 GB update; I really dislike sitting here for an hour waiting for a "patch" to download on a regular basis. That's not a patch anymore; you sawed off the leg and put on a prosthetic. This is the video game equivalent of the ship of Theseus.
The fact that I'm taking the time to write this review says something because I don't write reviews. Don't buy this piece of garbage. Arma is everything this game is not and wishes to be. Don't waste your money on a game that has crap servers, crap mechanics, a crap community, terrible support and terrible anti-cheat. Just buy Arma if you would like to keep your sanity. You can thank me later. I've given every opportunity for this game to get better but to be honest it only gets worse.
Bought this game to play with friends, only I couldn't ever get into the game without video glitches be it flashing green or flickering in and out as if my video card was going bad, I knew it wasn't my video card as its a brand new 1080 ti. Since I have not been able to play it the game has somehow counted 21 hours play time

been playing this game since 2017, 2141 hrs on record. Love and hate this game, its 2019 still not able to get rid of hackers. I feel like bluehole doesnt really wanna fix this problem, cuz hackers = more copies  to them.
While PUBG keep losing players, now they trying to make as much as they can before this game is over, keep adding skins and keys in to the store, i used to purchase some keys, but i wont spend other penny on this game.
This game is quite fun, but the amount of bugs in it makes it hard to enjoy. The game frequently shuts down for no reason, and the error message it triggers bugs out as well, which is beyond annoying. I don't recommend it.
Pubg is one of the best games I have ever played since 1995, however it is massively hacked. Of the 99 players who assemble to start each games I estimate between 60 and 80 of them have hacks. So how is it Mischiefmaker and myself are the top duo in the world. (Check stats) Every player in front of us is a hack as we are in the top half a percent of players out of 2.5 million. 
Hide. Never engage, and that will get you to the last 5 in a game mostly 4th third or second. If you engage you die.Sometimes about every few months you can clock up a win but it is very difficult as the last 10 in each game are hacks against hacks. Most are impatient and young so you strike for the first time when its the last 4 or three, use grenades and monotov. Remember they can press a button and the aimbot they have will go straight to your head, so knocking them is the key to winning before their aimbot kills you. They can also see you at all times. They even have flying cars and god and demigod.
Pubg are powerless to stop them.
What pubg should do is to give us 1 hack free map. Nobody cares about having several maps or competitions, just give us 1 hack free map. 
I have played this game in xbox which although not hack free, it is mainly hack free and the game is brilliant. The computer game is far better for hacker companies to develop hacks for, hence playing pubg on the computer is a waste of your time, unless you enjoy killing hackers as we do.
To be honest it was the best game on steam a year ago not now:
> The devs know that game is dying so instead of doing serious things they keeep making money and they work on cosmetics not the game  and they try to make more $  before it will be a dead game & it will be soon.
> There is out there alots of better optimized games to play without wasting your time like Rainbow Six Siege or Apex & they are a way better than a chinees game.
> Good bye PUBG hope the best Dev Team you have maked alots of money its time to go and have fun.
I can't really recomended this game becouse this game optimization is still terrible. Really long loading time especialy if you only use HDD, and some bug here and there still present although not as much as before
Do not play this game! There are way to many hackers... I do love this game but the dying community and the amount of hackers still on the platform is insane
