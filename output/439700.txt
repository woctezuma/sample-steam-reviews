This is NOT the Full game, this is just the Test Server you receive access to for free when you purchase H1Z1 King of the Kill.

This Test Server is used to test updates before they go live.   

I think it's great that we get the chance to check out an update before it goes live to see how much they game may change after the update.
I'm liking all the people who want Daybreak to fix their game, but yet whenever I go and try to check out new updates on the test server no ones ever on but me. SeemsGood

+good -bad or need improve or change


+Looting while moving (brings more of a skillgap and does not get you killes)
+/- Ar-15 nice recoil needs way more skill and is not goot at spraying BUT i would not give it a random spray because it destroys the whos meaning of learning a gun if its just random 
- ak and hellfire are way to strong and outcalles the ar in range / mid / close range fights 
-with the decrease ofd the bulltet drop its overall more easy to long range snipe ppl which i dotn like ( no skill needed) also with 0 drop and more bullet speed gettting shot out of a driving car is no problem and need 0 skill 
- shotgun is useless 0 range and hellfire outclasses it in every section 
ff. i was someone who like the shotgun and dont think it was op just i dint like the randomness it had you never knew after you hit someone how muthc hp is left and you had to guess 
- to many POI it slows the game down and make it more like pubg not fast past bc everywhere can some just hide and loot for the whole game 
-the movement it to slow with the increast speed of the bullets it makes spraying way more better than tapping even on longer range 
ff. i would keep the movement system and let teh bulletspeed like on test but increast teh bullet drop like on live rn 
-/+ croutchspamming taken out the game is a good move but in my opinion its to strong and the change slows dont the movement  so a ( +/-)

in conclussion i like the update but there are many things that just went wrong or were misunderstod from the community (for ex: shotgun broken !! DBG: we bring a counter for it the smg and nerfe the shotgun ) but we wanted a consistent shotgun good on close bad at range not more or less (ex2: we hate the ar-15 sprayers DBG: or we make a better recoil and a random pattern so its not that ez )
but we wanted harter recoil to LEARN but with a random this is just not possible ,
thanks for reading
Kinda funny people still having tantrums about this now?  I mean They have brought h1z1 back, with a pre season 3 revert and are trying to fix these things where daybreak went wrong & not listening to the right people it seems.  (& yeah it is a crime what DB did to Just Survive and the BR) but Just Survive may be coming back too hopefully if NantG comes through witha  deal with DB.  You can follow Snoops channel here, he's keeping ppls up to date with JS/z1 etc.  I for one amd dying for JS to come back & the Aus z1 BR servers need to fill up again...So have a little patience please it may take some time, but HOPEFULLY they do not fk it up again and it is back up ASAP.
I bought H1Z1 in pre season 7 and i didn't know much about the game. I thought i wouldn't really like it that much but whatever i bought it anyway. I actually started to like the game and later i found out about its past. The good days of preseason 3, the Z1 map the old recoil. I always thought those days were better but i continued playing anyways. I started watching yt videos about the game so i heard the news about the Z1 map coming out. I knew it would be good. When it went live i played a bit and really enjoyed it. Everything is great. You won't see people carry a shotgun at everytime. People start making use of the ak full auto and the ar is sprayable. I love it. Then i decided to go to live servers to play solo with many people as test servers were not filling up. After i played the test, I could play live again it was so bad. I now understand why the community is raging to bring ps3 back. And the test is not even close to actual ps3 as i have seen from gameplays. The devs are making good moves right now and i support that. Keep it up
The Test Server for h1z1, what more is there to say, expect bugs and crashes being that its a testing server of new features.
If you're eager to try new content being added then this Test Server is the way.
ligit i just downloaded the test server and my fps went from being in the low 50s in the cities to the low of 90s i now have no fps issues with the game even at ultra settings hopefully it goes tothe actual game
Bought the game after the split. I enjoy it, yes it has bugs but they do slowly get fixed unlike some devs who ignore and play dumb to bugs in their games. I have 140+ hours and feel ym moneey was well spent as Im not even bored of BR yet, and with the new Ignition mode coming, I can see those hours getting alot higher
I've got 1500 hours into live servers on this game and counting... The Developers care very much and they're always fixing things.. Definitly give it a try!
I've tried the new H1Z1 remastered for about 25 minutes in combat zone and I can say it was enough for me to write you my feedback: it definitely feels good, a lot better than how the current h1z1 is, the good old mechanics are missed by most of the community. However I encourage to also change back the weapon sounds.. the AR-15 especially, it has an awful sound and the old one was the best, please bring it back. Definitely you should try it out and I  believe in the DEVELOPERS that they will listen to our community feedback and MAKE H1Z1 GREAT AGAIN!
The game was good untill they changed the weapons and since then i havent rlly played the game mutch. I have played since z1 so the z1 rework is nice. The game still dosent fell as good as it was. its a recomend but not at the same time.
The combat update is god damn beautiful i never expected this big of an update really, i recently bought the game and i liked it more than pubg and with this update i love it :D, improved the shooting ALOTTTTT
As of 10/7/2017 it still carries the ORIGINAL aspect of H1Z1:JustSurvive, its what i love and miss the most. Please stay like this!
I do recommend this game.
Also money

I have a problem i bought h1z1 i only have the test server, after i downloaded it went in and said the servers were down for like couple times now had this problem for 2 days now went on h1z1 servers not working still.

Let me just say one thing...SCREW THIS GAME!!

First of all, I do not own this game. I actually played it on my friend's expensive build for a PC. 
To be honest, it can be fun 10% of the time, but the game is nothing compaired to PUBG or Fortnite. The amount of effort put into the game is sad, and the only reason you would play is to spend hundreds of dollars on crap for your character.

 The standard for open-world survival games has been set, and this game, sadly, falls short of both the set standard and its compitition. How? Unlike PUBG or Fortnite, this game lacks constant good updates, the game has a load of bugs, and there is nothing to work for. 

If you don't agree with my opinion, just take a look at the other 78,000 negative reviews. 

When a game is constantly fighting to stay mixed, then you know it has problems.
I am truly sorry this has been such a harsh review, but this game is a total waste of money.

(Why is there a separate review for the test server?!)
