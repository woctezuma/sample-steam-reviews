[h1] You feel an evil presence watching you... [/h1]
This is the sort of game that you boot up thinking you'll spend an hour or two on, only to one day wake up face down on your keyboard surrounded by bottles and plates wondering where the past 3 weeks went. 100 hours in and I've still not defeated the current 'final' boss, something that's a mixture of the games' excellent difficulty curve, and a melancholy realisation that once I defeat him, my time with the game will naturally come to an end. 

Primarily, Terraria is a sandbox game. You appear in a new world with some basic equipment and no real instruction, eventually you will build a small house to survive the monsters that surface during the night, discover some form of corruption eating away at the world, encounter new NPCs and face off against powerful Boss enemies. Despite all this, you are given little direction, these are merely facets of a larger game that allows players to do as they wish, encountering all the world has to offer at mostly their own pace. Part of the great design behind the title is in the difficulty curve I mentioned earlier, meaning challenges pitted against a player start easy and steadily increase at a rate easy to handle. Although traditional RPG elements are largely absent, a discrete levelling system is present in the form of Bosses that have been defeated, meaning if you don't progress through these enemies then the gameplay doesn't become more difficult. In fact, the first boss doesn't spawn until you're suitably equipped with armour and health. 

My hours in the game are split roughly equally between single and multiplayer. Single player stands up on its own perfectly fine, but in my opinion the game is much more rewarding gathering some friends and working together to tackle the bosses, as the feeling of reaching new goals is shared, and the ammount of 'grinding' for materials is spread across multiple people. It also helps to appreciate the brilliant soundtrack, as if you voice chat with your group then spontaneous humming along loudly is to be expected. 

Enemy design is exciting and unique, with floating eyes, possessed suits of armour, giant robotic worms, and a ninja suspended in a giant ball of slime all making appearances. That being said, whoever on the design team is responsible for 'hellbats' has earned a special sort of hatred from myself...

All in all Terraria is an amazing experience from beginning to end, its tone is humourous at times whist still provoking a feeling of wonderment and mystery in its exploration, and fearful excitement at its combat. It's a game I will come back to time and time again looking to recapture the memories I've made, and to forge new ones. It is a rare game in that with no shred of a doubt, these hours I have spent were not wasted. I heartily recommend that you purchase this game.

Honestly, I don't know why Terraria has so many haters. This game literally has everything. Fun to play, tons of things to do, bosses to kill, ofc it has multiplayer so you can enjoy everything with friends, items to farm, a lot of stuff and decorations to build with, not to mention that if you hit the bottom and feel like you have completed the game, you can install some mods adding a crazy amount of new features, items, ect ...  When you're ingame (and I don't really know how to explain it) there's just something very chilling about it, maybe it's the music, maybe it's just every little detail about it. That's just how the game works. Perfect for chilling when you had a bad or exhausting day, but it's also the perfect entertainment for your free time. 10/10
So, here's a simplified list of what you'll find in Terraria: 

- This is a 2D RPG with platformer and sandbox elements
- It has an incredible amount of content to it
- Multiple classes that are shaped through armor bonuses (but you can use other items not of your class)
- Idk like a billion items? Lots of weapons, armor, cosmetics, and building material. It's crazy
- A good healthy serving of cool and interesting bosses to fight
- Lots of NPC's to buy stuff from (be ready to build basically a hotel for the like 30 of them in the game now)
- Really good retro soundtrack but more modern, that fit the creative environments they pair with. Boss fight music gets you pumped! 
- Is it too easy for you? Try Expert mode! Don't feel like you're penalized enough for dying? Set your character to Hardcore!
- I almost forgot to mention… SO MUCH CRAFTING

Cons? Hmm.

- Inventory management… the abundance of items will overwhelm you. I usually make a structure dedicated to storing all my loot in chests. Stay organized!
- Fishing is pretty useful but… well it’s not exactly exciting. You can get some great stuff that way though.
- Expect a big difficulty spike after defeating the boss in the Underworld! You’ll feel like a noob all over again, but once you work past it is where the game feels like it truly begins for me.
- Some items in the game are pretty rare and some of these rares are used to craft or otherwise obtain some of the best loot in the game. 

Other thought: 
- If you can play with friends, or find people to run through the game with, do it. It's much more fun that way. You can still enjoy it quite a bit single player, however... it's not the same when you can't laugh when someone gets destroyed by a boulder trap.

Story time (if you want to torture yourself and read my rambling):

I bought this game ages ago, back when it was still in development, before any of the expansions and cleanups it's gone through. I spent $10 on this.

Since then, the Dev team (at least back in 2014-2015 or so when I kept up with it) would post threads about once a month at the least to let people know what was planned/ the progress of the game. It kept getting updated, adding more content and mechanics. I remember being super excited when new weapon types were added, rare mounts were added. Accessories so your character can fly around the map? Gimme. Something I always admire too is Re-Logic did not simply focus on adding more stuff end game, they kept polishing up early game too, adding things like Ropes to make things easier until you get hookshots, simple versions of weapons you find later like Spears, wooden yo-yo, more early game magic items. It used to be a much less enjoyable, slower grind to get to mid game content where the pace picks up.

There were at least a couple times where the development with the game was supposedly going to halt, and I was satisfied with it then. I'd gotten more content and enjoyment out of Terraria than most games I'd bought for $30 or more. Yet somehow, maybe a year after hearing nothing, a new content update would surprisingly be pushed out. This happened at least twice, when I thought it would be laid to rest as is. 

I spent $10 on this.
I have played this game for 1,055 hours.
This is an amazing game. It's ability to make people gravitate back to it after an update is very nice. Speaking of updates, the developers release amazing and wholesome updates from time to time. I really recommend this game for mainly two reasons, it has a great replay ability were you just keep making worlds and playing it over and over again. The other reason is that you can do a lot of stuff with the world. From making giant houses and contraptions to attempting to kill a boss multiple times, it is a fun game. But it is also multiplayer which is a great addition. Playing by yourself can get boring sometimes but when I play this game with my friends, I just can't stop playing. I really recommend this game, it is definitely worth the 10 dollars.
This review applies to Terraria 1.3.0.8 and earlier.

The essence of [i]Terraria[/i] is that it prioritizes fun! It's not a game where players must fear losing progress due to forgetting safety measures or manage breakable tools. The game knows how to bring out a sense of enjoyment and achievement. Grinding is an option, not a requirement or an excuse to drag out game time. Besides, there is much to discover and do in the game. Clocking in at 1,000+ hours, having all 88 achievements, and introducing multiple friends to the game should be indicative of that. With that being said, I'll list some pros/cons I've found memorable.

[b]Pros[/b]
[list]
    [*][b]Customization[/b]: There is a staggering amount of customization available in-game. You not only can choose from several basic character designs but also have a plethora of armors, costumes, accessories, and pets for your character. You can also color/dye any of your equipment and get all sorts of flashy effects. Dyes aren't consumable, so you have few restrictions on perfecting your assemblage.
    [*][b]Exploration[/b]: The [i]Terraria[/i] world may be finite, but it is incredibly diverse. Each biome has its own personality and houses many unique elements. It takes a minimum of three worlds to discover everything, and that's only with absurd luck (see "The Creation of the Guide" painting). The game additionally has an impressive number of flavor. That rubble on the ground can be dug up, and a Worm might pop out from it. You can reignite the burnt-out Campfire in that small cavern. You didn't think that NPCs could fend for themselves during a Blood Moon or invasion, did you? Just when you think you've learned everything about the [i]Terraria[/i] world, you discover something surprising.
    [*][b]Creativity[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] is as much as about creating your world as it is exploring it. Blocks and furniture are not just for aesthetics, but they also introduce some neat mechanics. Players looking to engineer stuff will enjoy the contraptions possible by the wiring mechanic, and designers will love being able to paint the overworld with a wide spectrum of colors. [i]Terraria[/i] features innovative design at its finest.
    [*][b]Progression options[/b]: Like any good RPG, there's a great sense of progress made in a playthrough. You mine or slay enemies for the materials needed to upgrade equipment, and the world is bountiful enough that this progress never feels linear or constrained. Even the achievements flow nicely, never feeling too easy, cheap, or absurdly difficult.
    You never need to rely crutch items to make progress. Rather, in my experience, my friends and I frequently [i]had too many options[/i] and had to reluctantly store away some of our neat loot. There is always something to switch to if a playstyle becomes easy or repetitive.
    [*][b]Balance[/b]: A game can become boring if there is a certain playstyle players fall into. [i]Terraria[/i] manages to find the right balance so that all playstyles have a fair shot at completing the game. There is no bottleneck or singular Infinity+1 Sword needed for progress.
    [*][b]Diversity[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] promotes itself as a game for any type of player, and that claim certainly has truth in it. The game has gameplay suited for battlers, explorers, and builders, and I can also tack on several options that appeal to other types of players. Collectors will balk at the quantity of items and achievements offered, and players can challenge themselves to make progress with nearly any conduct. Play with only melee/ranged/magic/summoning weapons? Sure. A yo-yo only run? That's popular! No crafting/mining? Certainly. Play the entire game upside-down? Of course--and that's bug-free! If that's not enough, you can fire up a world in Expert Mode for the extra challenge. There's something for everyone.
    I've had a friend who would ask on his first playthrough 'Can I do ____ in the game?' and I could answer in the positive the majority of the time. Just for starters, you can teleport, build trap-filled dungeons, set up PVP minigames, and record the soundtrack. The game's breadth is incredible.
    [*][b]Automation[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] would be daunting without any form of automation. You have thousands of items, hundreds of monsters, dozens of mechanics, and an expansive world to build on or dig through. The game offers much to ease the burden of management. Auto-select picks the right tool rather than requiring manual selection. The smart cursor allows for one-click digging. Quick-stacking is much more convenient than depositing items one-by-one, chest-by-chest. Farming is not only feasible but easy. Making measured builds is simplified with items like the Ruler. The game naturally provides the player ease-of-use tools so a playthrough can be focused on the fun stuff rather than on chores.
    [*][b]Performance[/b]: Many games fall off a prospective player's wishlist due to system requirements. [i]Terraria[/i] is a game that features a crazy amount of sprites, particle effects, physics, lighting, and entity interaction. Being a 2-D game only nets you that much speed before optimizations come into play *cough*[i]Starbound[/i]*cough*. The game's requirements are reasonable and the gameplay is optimized such that it doesn't require a bulky system to run on. I was able to run it decently on a 2007 year-old desktop on Windows XP with low-end specifications. The performance of the game to medium- and some low-end systems makes it accessible to a broad demographic of players. On the other hand, if you have a high-end system, go ahead and fire up that Color lighting mode and enjoy [i]Terraria[/i] in its full glory.
    [*][b]Quality of life[/b]: Many games have little quirks that people have to accept to enjoy. Not only is [i]Terraria[/i]'s gameplay mainly devoid of bugs, but it also buffs out these quirks. Players are separated from worlds, allowing for easy singleplayer-to-multiplayer transfer. Characters can ascend blocks without needing to jump. Chests containing items don't explode if you try to harvest them. Keys are easily remappable for those familiar with alternate control schemes. Quick-stacking skips 'favorite' items. You can use the in-game system for taking wide screenshots for giant builds. You can set player configurations to ease the smallest of annoyances. In general, you never feel you're fighting the game's controls and interface.
    [*][b]Continued updates[/b]: It would be very easy for [i]Terraria[/i], as popular as it is, to offer game expansions as paid DLC. The developers, instead, make their continued updates absolutely free to owners of the game. The developer-community relationship is superb.
[/list]

[b]Cons[/b]
[list]
    [*][b]New player friendliness[/b]: The in-game help system is stunted, and players can easily become overwhelmed by the ever-growing number of toys in [i]Terraria[/i]'s sandbox. Many people resort to a guide to help them through the game.
    [*][b]Grinding[/b]: While the game does not require noticeable grinding to progress, several tangents in the game require patience and luck. That fancy teleportation item pretty much necessitates a farm in the Hallow. The last component of a PDA could be hundreds of monster drops or fishing quests away. At a rate of one quest per in-game day, the 200 fishing quests achievement would require 4,800 minutes (3 1/3 days) to complete without resorting to tricks. It can be frustrating to have an achievement be left incomplete as a stretch, yet [i]Terraria[/i] is not above this issue.
    [*][b]Moddability[/b]: [i]Terraria[/i] is extensive enough that it doesn't need additional features, but people have been able to decode the game and develop external software and mods for a better game experience. It would be a boon if the game was open to the modding community for extended gameplay.

Hands down one of the best games I have ever played. Heck, it was the only reason I got Steam. This game is original and beautiful as a survival game.
You'll never find a game more ripe with content, more beloved by its developers, more replayable, more visually an audibly beautiful for 10 bucks. This is a modern masterpiece
You can be a werewolf riding a unicorn while shooting rainbows from a gun. You can build teleporters, find a hair dresser in a spider cavern, and get a sword that shoots cats. You can take on the lord of the moon using a yoyo, summon a sharknado minion that shoots sharks at your enemies, and find sky temples where air wyverns spawn. You can buy a music box from a wizard and go record the music that you like the most so you can have it playing in your base whenever you want, and then you can go build a castle made entirely out of white marble. 

It would seem the only thing Minecraft has over this game is 1 dimension. Trust me, once you get used to it and start learning about the game, Terraria is simply one of the most satisfying sandbox experiences out there. It may sound rude, but compared to this, Minecraft just has no imagination.
I have 2780 (Edit: Now 3150 (Edit 2: Now 3908)) hours on this game. That's over 100 (Edit: Now 130 (Edit 2: Now 162.8)) days straight.

I enjoyed it the whole time.

I'm not even CLOSE to being done with everything I want to do in this game either.

It's worth buying, especially for only $10.

[b]First and foremost, this is an "adventure" game.[/b] No, not an "adventure game." In those you pick up a stick shaped like an "F" and use it to open an oversized lock on a chest full of bubblegum that you'll soon need to throw at some dogs so you can sneak past them to get to the... no. This is an "adventure" game. The game [i]is[/i] an adventure.

A real adventure. Like when you take a shortcut through the wilderness, but end up further and further off path as you follow a stream, looking for a good place to cross.

A real adventure. Like when you go hiking in the mountains and get lost. Only to realize it'll be quicker to get back to civilization by continuing forward, rather than returning the way you came.

A real adventure. Like when you find yourself some place you've never been before, and with just a few tools, build yourself a makeshift home and defend it from zombies at night while exploring the world around you during the day. Eventually working your way underground into chasms filled with treasure and the occasional abandoned dwelling. Perhaps running across a giant beehive in an underground jungle or a buried pyramid under the desert. Finding your way deep into the darkness where the dead wander freely and mushrooms fluoresce brightly. Going deeper and deeper yet; to the point where the molten core of the planet lights up your eyes in a way only the sun had previously done.

The hard part of writing a review for a game like this is not spoiling too much while still letting people know how deep the game actually is. So much of what I enjoyed about my first playthrough of this game was [i]discovery[/i]. Terraria might seem too simple when you first start out, and then possibly even overwhelming. But you'll be glad you spent effort to follow the stream or continue forward through the mountains.

There's weapons and magic, but you never pick a class, like warrior or archer. Due to the wide range of weapons, accessories, and armor choices you'll suddenly realize at some point, perhaps when surrounded by your minions, that you've specialized as a summoner. Or that you're a wizard, or explosives expert. Or perhaps you're some unique archer-warrior hybrid. But your choices and discoveries have slowly lead you into your role; you never chose it from a drop down list.

There's a multitude of biomes to discover. Each with their own unique enemies, and of course, epic boss fights. There's an incredible number of things you can do as you progress through the game. And while it plays fine single player, if you have a friend or two you can bring with you on this journey, you'll have that much more fun and they will thank you for it.

Sure, you can spend hours upon hours building elaborate castles decorated with furniture you've crafted or statues you've collected from around the world. You can reshape the terrain around you - spreading biomes you like or cutting down those you don't. You can even bring biomes up from deep in the earth and set up the perfect potion mushroom farm right next to your base. One of my favorite things to do is to use the wiring system to set elaborate boobie traps around my fortifications. But you don't have to do [i]any[/i] of that to progress. It's really all up to you. Although even if none of that is "your thing," you might be so drawn in that you find yourself happily engaged in such activities.

And yes, a big part of the game is digging, but it's primarily a means of exploration. A means of reaching that next treasure chest, or cluster of gems. A means of reaching the next deep fissure in the earth. A great adventure awaits you.
I’d only wish I had played this game sooner!

Terraria if a fascinating game, that introduces players to an open, 2D world that features adventure, building, crafting, boss battles and much more. As a player who had experienced the vanilla and the mod variant, I’ll be commenting for both game experiences.

The vanilla [original] game present you with the basic components of how to play. While it can be a grind at the start to gather materials to build, in the later game you’ll be introduced to more content, new areas, enemies and NPCs. The game is hugely focused on progression, which makes it quite an addiction to play. My favorite aspects of the game are the weapons and gear, plus the boss battles. No item is ever the same, as well as the monsters that we face. The aesthetics are also nice; the Plantera mask and kimono were one of my personal favorites to dress for my character. Lots of items in the game are customizable, including colour changes to upgrades for bonus stats.

Now, for the mod version, there were even more available content for players. The mods my friends and I played with on his server were namely the Thorium Mod and Calamity mod. These mods added features such as more boss monsters, items, NPC and more. Some players will frown at mods and call it “cheats” and whatnot. However, this is not the case as it brings more complexity to the original game, and it's not intended for new players anyways. We played on Expert/Revengeance mode and fought additional bosses like Astrium Deus, and the Siren and Leviathan. In my experience, the modded variation provided and even more thrilling challenge than the Vanilla version. I recommend trying it after you’ve completed the original game.

In general, Terraria is a must-play for anyone who hasn’t done so.
[h1]Introduction[/h1]
I am Tigerfrost. I would like to apologize for anything that is miss-spelled or any grammar issues. Thank you.
If you'd like to skip straight to Pro's & Con's, please move to the bottom of the page. Thank you.

[b]UPDATED EDIT 7/6/2015:[/b] With the release of Update 1.3, Terraria has become three hundred times better. Update 1.3 adds in loads of new items, monsters, bosses, events, and more. The new bosses are a really big challenge and very cleverly done. The addition of achievements is addicting to any player who loves to hunt achievements, like myself. Including the new gamemode known as "Expert Mode" which is basically like turning the difficulty up to 'brutal'. Lots of other changes as well, like new textures and sounds, and the new addition of world stats to keep track of how many of each type of monster you kill (Which now rewards you with banners). 

[h1]How I Found Out About "Terraria"[/h1]
I found out about Terraria the same way I use to always find games, YouTube. I randomly came across a video called "Terraria". I took a look, and instantly fell in love with what I saw, and knew I had to have the game for myself. It looked like a great combination of gerne' that I love to bits. Being a Minecraft fan since the beggining of Alpha, I knew I [b]MUST[/b] have it.

[h1]Unfair First Impressions[/h1]
When ever you ask someone about Terraria, read a review, or watch a video, 95% of the time you hear "Minecraft clone" or "2D Minecraft". Which is incorrect on so many levels. If you have heard this many times, and are thinking twice about actually playing Terraria, please read on as it is nothing like Minecraft. 

[h1]Review Of Terraria[/h1] 
Terraria is a very unique game for what it does. There have been games like it in the past, but the amount of content and play ability is beyond anything I've ever seen before. 

Terraria is a [b]sandbox[/b], [b]RPG[/b], [b]action[/b], etc. 2D game. It does it's thing very well. I haven't noticed any UI bugs, or ones that I have, are fixed almost instantly after the patch is released. The gameplay it provides is not only smooth, it is addicting and fun. The combat system in the game is perfect for me, and a lot of others. There are so many enemy types in this game that are not copy paste, each one [b]does their own thing[/b] and has [b]their own weaknesses & strength's[/b] 

Example on the kind of enemies you could come across. 
Normal walking/running enemies, that have a soul objective to charge you until death. These may include enemies like the [b]zombie[/b] or [b]skeleton[/b].
As there are other enemies who will do the same thing, but in a different way (So not everything is copy/paste.). Like the [b]slime[/b] enemy type, which come in many varieties, which will bounce towards you. Or the [b]spider[/b] enemy type, which will walk on the ground, but can also climb on the walls to get to you quicker. Just to name a few.

"Well, how do I defend myself against these enemies?"
Good question. Let's get that.

[h1]Items & Furniture[/h1]
This is where Terraria gets big. Even though the world's are limited, they provide so much that you could spend 800 hours of game time on a single [i]small world[/i] and still have many things to do.

In the world of Terraria, there are alternate versions of almost everything. What I mean by this is, each world you have will not be the same. For example, there is a 50/50 chance when loading a world to have the default version of something, or the alternate. Such as the music that plays, there are different tracks for the same biomes, just depends on what random one you got. Or for textures on things like, grass, and trees. Also things like ore, in a default world you would have Copper as your basic ore, but in an alternate world, you'd have Tin as your basic ore. What this does is really expands the play time someone can spend in Terraria. Allowing a single person to play the game over and over, and never have the same experience. 

Below the surface are loads of blocks, dirts, ores, and more. Ore like Copper, Tin, Lead, Iron, Silver, Platinum, Gold, Cobalt, etc. And blocks like normal dirt, clay, stone, mud, cobwebs, and so many more. You need these ores to make your weapons and armor. You can find treasure deep underground, that holds many valuable things. You can increase your maximum health by finding [b]Life Crystals[/b] underground.

The weapon range in this game is massive. You even have magic weapons, like spell books, and mana weapons. There are also bows, swords, pickaxes, axes, guns, lazers, cannons, familiars, and so much more.

I won't get into to much detail here, but the amount of content in this game is massive, and it's still being updated. Sure, Terraria has been through some rough times with updates, but when it gets an update, the update is full of new things and changes. 

[h1]Pro's & Con's (Overall Rating)[/h1]
Overall, Terraria is a great game that you can spend hours of time in, and still be having fun in many years to come. It's a steal for the price of $9.99, and especially when there is a sale that lowers the game to $2.00 or less. This game is definitely a choice for sandbox gamers looking for an easy to slip into, addicting experience. 

Pro's:
+Loads of content for hours of game time.
+Great combat system.
+Smooth gameplay, that's easy to slip into.
+Provides a good challenge.
+Fun and creative boss battles.
+Amazing side events that you cannot resist.
+Achievements are addicting to those achievement hunters.
+Expert & Hardcore modes add hundreds more hours of gameplay and possibility.

Con's:
-No infinite world option. (Doesn't drop overall score - But can be annoying to some players)
-No easy way to edit worlds before creation (Like choosing whether to have Crimson or Corruption)

Overall Rating: Is about a 14.5/15 (Must Own!)

[h1]Credits & Disclaimer[/h1]
Thank you for taking the time to read my review, I hope this helped out with your decision on whether to make a purchase or not.

Remember, this review is based off of opinion only. You may not think the same way as me towards something, but that's okay, because we are all human.
Terraria at first glance can be called a "2D Minecraft" from some viewers, but it surprisingly has a lot of differences.

For starters, while Terraria is indeed a 2D sandbox game, the main highlight of the game isn't just creating whatever you want, but working your way up from basic equipment up to [i]fighting space invaders and SQUIDLORD[/i]. ..er excuse me, the "Moon Lord".

Speaking of equipment, at no point what-so-ever do your tools or armor ever break. There's also currency in the form of bronze, silver, gold, and platinum coins which can be used to buy goods from friendly NPCs. Said friendly NPCs can appear if you fufill certain conditions and have a vacent room for them. So on and so forth there are [i]many[/i] differences between this and Minecraft that makes the whole comparison silly to bring up.

Though I won't be praising [i]everything[/i] about the game, as it does have some flaws. For starters, while the PC version has [i]no[/i] tutorial, every other version of the game has one. There are console and mobile exclusive events, items, and even [i]music[/i] which was a personal pet peeve for me. Some accessories made from combining others together end up being less useful than if you were to use the two seperately or create an entirely different accessory, the fishing achievements are quite a nightmare to go after, and the beginning can be [i]VERY[/i] tedious, especially in Expert Mode. Throwing weapons are also useless past the Wall of Flesh, with a majority of items involving throwing capabilities being thrown out of the window by the time Skeletron comes around.

Do these gripes of mine hinder the experience as a whole?
I don't think so, and I still think the game is worth checking out if you're into games such as this.

An additional bonus, there's also a pretty awesome modding community for the game too, which adds even [i]more[/i] things you can do with the game long after you taken care of the vanilla game's final boss. Some recommended mods to check out would be Leveled, Thorium, and Calamity.

I'd highly recommend getting Terraria if you haven't yet, especially if it's on sale. Though I would also recommend playing the game with friends, as it's muuuuuuch more fun and also not as tedious. ..maybe.
No game has drawn me back over weeks or years, to come back to this game again and again and start over, like Terraria.  It never loses it's "fun factor" like most games do over time.
Terraria is one of the best indie games ever created. There is so much to do in this game and so much to collect. Even after you invest dozens of hours there will still be monsters to hunt, bosses to fight, gear to craft, materials to find, and fun to be had. Take all of that and throw in friends and you will have a blast with this masterpiece.

Gameplay: The gameplay here is very simple overall, but the deep customization is what makes it so addicting and memorable. Combat is very simple, and has three main branches that you can follow: Melee, Range, and Magic. There are various weapons, trinkets, armor, and summons that will increase the potency of your talents and allow you to achieve maximum stats. This would mean nothing of course if there wasn't a huge cast of enemies to fight and there is: there are over 400 different enemies each with its own set of drops to be obtained. Fighting isn't the only thing you'll do though, as you'll also need a powerful and invulnerable shelter to house your possessions, NPCs, and spawnpoint, all the while keeping them safe from the hundreds of various threats. The sheer amount of different blocks, background tiles, and furniture ensure that you will never build the same house twice, unless you want to of course. The mining in this game is also addictive and fun. There are so many exotic treasures to be found in the underground along with dangerous enemies and fantastic biomes. Every ground level biome has its own cave that holds its respective gear type (Ex. Snow Biome Caves have ice swords) giving you tons to explore, loot, and conquer. Once you obtain powerful enough equipment and stats, you will eventually pit yourself against the game's many bosses which are doorways for new loot and new phases for your world to undergo. There is an unbelievable amount of content in this game and it all fits together so well. Considering the fact that this game will continue to be updated after the release of its sequel is a guarantee of the developer's hard work and consideration for the strong and ever growing community.

Overall Score for Gameplay: 10/10

Story: The story in this game is extremely minimal and more left to the speculation of individuals. What is certain is that your in a post apocalyptic type world that is overrun by deadly creatures and being taken over by evil and corruption. As you explore and upgrade your equipment you'll develop the world into a safer and pure place that the friendly NPCs can inhabit easier. In short, your a kind of guardian standing against the tide of evil that looks to spread throughout the world and consume it.  While there are some interesting tidbits given to you by the NPCs as to why your there and what your doing, they don't add too much. Fortunately, this game doesn't need a canon story to be good and is open enough for players to speculate what they think the game is about allowing them to create their own stories, which is really what makes this gem so special.

Overall Score for Story: 9/10

Characters: The characters in this game are simply crafted, each NPC has its own personality but they aren't developed in any meaningful way and stay pretty much the same throughout the playthrough which is fine as their main purpose is to sell you goods. They are however pretty diverse and have enough character for the player to speculate them which fits in with the rest of the story nicely.

Overall Score for Characters: 8/10

Graphics: The graphics in this game fit the theme and overall feeling very well. The biomes are very different looking from one another, the NPCs all fit in nicely with the scenery, the building materials stand out from nature, and the particle effects are very nice. The visuals are timeless and will continue to serve this game well for many years to come.

Overall Score for Graphics: 10/10

Soundtrack: The soundtrack in this game is very nice and fits the mood well. Each biome has its own theme that truly brings it to life and gives it depth. Alternate music also plays for bosses which alerts the player to the rising difficulty and awards if he/she succeeds. The OST does its job very well and is definitely worth buying buy itself if your into that.

Overall Score for Soundtrack: 9/10

Sound: The sound effects in this game are great. The ambient noise such as rain or wind are convincing and really bring the locations a sense of authenticity. With the hundreds and thousands of enemies, objects, material, and weapons, you'd think they make similar sounds but they do not which really improves the overall quality of the game. 

Overall Score for Sound: 10/10 

So yeah, this game is really something special and can be run on a laptop from the 90s so there is no excuse from a hardware or wallet standpoint not to pick this one up. It has a ton of replay value and even after you "beat" it there is still plenty of fun to be had with friends. I have owned this game on Xbox 360, Xbox One, PS Vita, and now PC and I can still sink plenty of hours in and still feel like I have a lot to do.

Overall Score for Game: 9.4/10

I can't believe you took the time to read all this.(Did you?)
Thanks for listening to my opinion, and buy this game.
You'd think with all the hours i have the game would get boring, but it isnt. This game is fun by itself, but get a friend or download some mods and say bye bye to your freetime.
Alright so I've been playing this game ever since 1.0.4, building stuff, killing slimes and getting freaked out by the continuous stream of horrifying yet excellent content coming, so it's about time I should actually make a review on this game. I met a lot of people and learned so many things through these friendships and communities and practically gone through what seems like the virtual equivalent to my childhood, so wow does this game have a special place in my heart.

Putting my sentimental values in this game aside, content-wise this game is practically everything a fantasy-loving, retro game, sandbox, adventurous and architectually creative enthusiast could ever ask for (see if you're not a fan of any of those kind of games, then you probably might not enjoy this considering the beginning is rather.. slow). Gosh there's just so much to love in this game that I don't even know where to begin, that is, if you give this game a chance. I shall warn anyone who isn't a fan of reading guides that the game in the beginning isn't very intuitive, as it just throws you in the world with no tutorial whatsoever. However there is a Guide NPC, so if you do feel lost on what to do, you should speak to said NPC. The controls of this game is pretty basic; WASD to move, space to jump, number keys corresponding to the hotbar, click to attack, etc.

But once you got all of that figured out, boy is this game one heck of a ride, especially if you haven't read any spoilers and you have absolutely no idea what will happen next in this gem of a game. You'll be quite surprised with how many things you can discover, how many things you can create and conquer; I definitely recommend you play this with friends as progression throughout the game would be so much more funner, meaning you'll get to the fun stuff faster (i.e. the events and ridiculous weapons and mounts).
Terraria is a 2D sandbox game with good overall progression and enjoyable playing experience. I have put a pot of time into this game simply because it has massive replay ability. 
No, this isn't 2D Minecraft. Yes, this game is worth your money.
This game is my childhood. This is one of the best games ever made, and ive loved it for the whole 2000 hours ive played. I dont know what else to say, and im not good with reviews, but this game is absolutely worth your money
This is one of the best games ever made and the only reason it is not regarded as such is that it is not very accessible. I can imagine many critics have started Terraria, played for some hours trying to figure it out, and put it away. Very often, critics have drawn misguided conclusions that Terraria resembles Minecraft (or is a Minecraft clone), but in fact nothing could be further from the truth. Terraria is a procedurally generated sandbox survival metroidvania. Learning curve is steep, the game is hard and often requires you to consult to wikis and guides (even more so than the Souls series) but once you gain control of the game mechanics, you will find a very deep, hard core gem. Don’t let its eye-candy graphics fool you…

You are dropped into a world surrounded by many dangers. Initially, you are expected to make your first shelter, first weapon and just survive. This is the very core of the whole game. In order to beat stronger creatures, you need better weapons for which you need better crafting material. To get better crafting material, you need to mine deep into the earth, which leads you to find secret chests, face gazillion creatures including “bosses”. Boss fights not only require skill, but also need you to have the weapons, armors, potions, items necessary to beat them. Last, but not the least, there are plenty of events such as Halloween, Christmas, Pirate Invasion etc. with their own unique bosses and loots.

While you are working on mining for better tools, armors, weapons to be able to beat stronger enemies, you also need to keep expanding your “shelter”. A chair, ceiling and door is not sufficient any longer. You need to keep building new rooms to have room for new crafting centers and chests (for inventory). Every new room invites a new NPC to your shelter who can be crucial in your quest to beat the world of terraria, whether they sell unique items or provide healing.

Being a true sandbox game, you can also ignore progression and spend hundreds of hours just building. Your limit to what you can build and how you can customize it is your imagination. People at Terraria subreddit still manage to amaze me with their creativity and sometimes totally mind-blowing architecture. 

Whether you choose to play it as a metroidvania or as a sandbox 2d Minecraft, you will love Terraria. In my opinion, it is one of the best games ever made.

[b]PS:[/b] Buy it full price. Developers are still updating content and supporting the game after all these years (without any paid DLCs whatsoever), they really deserve some support.

[b]10/10[/b]
[h1]Terraria[/h1]
[i]Brutally honest reviews.[/i]

[h1]The good:[/h1]
[b]+[/b] Looks good for a 2D Title.
[b]+[/b] Good lighting.
[b]+[/b] Great optimization for how good its lighting. This game runs on any computer, albeit, you might have to use Retro lighting and/or lower graphical options.
[b]+[/b] Great depth for a "Sandbox Adventure" title.
[b]+[/b] Mixes Dungeon-Crawler with Exploration and "Mining-Sim".
[b]+[/b] All Magic weapons, and SOME Melee and Ranged weapons are unique and fun to use.
[b]+[/b] Each boss is unique, and very fun.
[b]+[/b] Tons of events that are unique and fun, from blood moons to solar eclipses.
[b]+[/b] Most enemies are unique, fun to figure out how they work, and kill.

[h1]The bad:[/h1]
[b]/[/b] To those who aren't used to 2D Combat, the combat can be kind of lack-luster and a little hard sometimes.
[b]/[/b] A lot of melee and ranged weapons feel samey.
[b]/[/b] There is a definite unbalance between Melee, Magic, and Ranged classes. Throwing, and Summoning are basically nonexistent.
[b]/[/b] The early game can be considered boring compared to the mid-game. End-game is the same, but at least goes a little faster.
[b]/[/b] Knowing what to do next or where to go is hard to figure out sometimes.

[h1]The ugly:[/h1]
[b]-[/b] None!

Terraria is a game that, time and time again, I see people comparing to Minecraft. You cannot really compare these games together, because to me, Terraria is a dungeon-crawler. You are meant to find good weapons, kill enemies and bosses, and mining is secondary. This is strengthened by the amount of unique enemies, bosses, accessories, weapons, and the likes. Terraria is a game that I [b]can recommend to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers.[/b] The combat isn't difficult, and I honestly like it. There's great music, amazing biome diversity, building is fun, enemies are just as fun and unique, bosses are hard to kill without taking a decent amount of damage. There are hooks, wings, pets, and way more that are unique.

*includes tools as weapons
Many people compare Terraria and Minecraft. And it's true, they are both voxel based mining games. However, Terraria tones down a lot of what Minecraft is in building and creativity, then makes up for it in the exciting combat and boss system. Don't get me wrong, you can still build interesting and exciting structures in Terraria, but the awe that some Minecraft creations can inspire is not found in Terraria. If you prefer emphasis on combat, boss battles, and equipment upgrades, but still want to be able to mine resources, create defenses, and terraform to your desire, Terraria is most certainly a good fit. There's a reason it's my most played game on Steam, and even as I write this, I have the game open on PSN to play with my friends.
After 1k hours in this game I think I can confidently say that it's got a very special place in my heart. Years ago when I first bought this game I've played through it at least fifty times, maybe more, with different class biases and challenges, mods and on expert mode. 

It's simply a wonderfully fun, in depth game, with so much replayability and different styles to play, that I'd reccommend it to anyone even remotely interested in it by the screenshots and videos on this store page. It's well worth it even at full price, but hey if you can get it on sale - which it goes on sale pretty often nowadays - then that's even better.
Have you ever wanted to fight a giant eyeball that has teeth by using a laser cannon that you obtained from an alien invasion while riding your giant bee? Then this game is for you.

Have you ever wanted to drink water while drowning to restore health so that you don't drown? Then this game is for you.

Have you ever wanted to explore a vast underground land of ash and lava? Then this game is for you.

Have you ever wanted an arsenal of unique and fun weapons to use, each with their own weird and wacky abilities, from firing nyan cats to summoning ice dragons? Then this game is for you.

Have you ever wanted lore that is almost entirely up to interpretation? Then this game is for you.

Have you ever wanted to fight the moon itself? Well too bad they scrapped that idea.

BUT STILL...

Have you ever wanted to have a good time? Then this game is for you!
Like, seriously. It's a fun game. Lots of replay value, too.
Before I say anything, this is not a minecraft clone. If anything in my opinion it's a ton better. 
The game is is mainly sandbox with some rpg elements. You get the choice of just solely using it as a sandbox(no creative like mode) or you choose certain builds, defeat bosses and an expert mode if your too good. The main builds are melee,magic,ranger and summoner. The terraria wiki(btw which is very helpful) goes into more detail on the pros and cons.
The crafting system in the game is also very good. Theres almost no need to have to find out how to craft things as you start with an npc who practically tells you everything you can craft with one item. You also only need to have the items in your inventory to craft rather than align them in some shape.

This game also has many npcs(just over 20) that mainly serve to sell or give certain info. They are quite straightforward to unlock and you keep them in houses you build. Certain npcs are quite helpful depending on the build you go for during the game.

Gaining money is also quite simple. This can range from defeating enemies, bosses and selling items to npcs.

There happens to be a plethora of items including tonnes of weapons and armour for each build and tonnes or craft able material from many many ores to item drops.

Terraria also has a few biomes including evil biomes as well. All these biomes are quite useful with their own enemies and generic animals. You also unlock a biome after hardmode(more on that later). Terraria's map is not infinite an you set the size when creating. However there is no problem with this especially choosing a large map. Even the small map is big enough to explore many many hours and there still will be something you missed.

The game itself kinda has two parts which are pre hard mode and hardmode. Hardmode is triggered after defeating a certain boss and increases the amount of items obtainable, more bosses and another biome. 

There happens to be events aswell which spawn different kind of enemies or are there to provide a sort of challenge. Some are random while most are summonable.

However no game is perfect though. There is a bit of grinding to do especially if you want items and these can be really rare. Once you've defeated the final boss, the game is somewhat too easy except the only way for a challenge is expert mode(haven't experienced this mode). Items due tend to get useless especially items that are crafted by ore. Luckily this can be sold to make ingame money. While i dont mind the 2d graphics some may not enjoy it as much. Im sure there are a few more flaws but i cant think of any. In terms of stability, it's fairly stable and i have not seen a single bug at all.

Im sure I missed quite a bit in this review but this game has so much to do. It can even be modded though I havent experienced that yet. Overall I highly recommend this game at even full price.
[h1] Terraria	[/h1]

Terraria is an amazingly fun to play 2D sandbox game. You start off with nothing but as you discover Terraria you notice how much is in this game.

[h1] Stats	[/h1]

Here are some general stats about Terraria to give you an idea of how impressive this game is.

Terraria contains:

- 2748 Items
- 401 enemies
- 76 potions
- 69 swords
- 34 bows
- 30 guns
- 21 bosses

As you can see Terraria contains a massive collection of fun.

[h1] Gameplay	[/h1]

You will start off by creating your character and creating your world. A nice feature to note is that you can have your character travel through multiple worlds while keeping their items. You will be thrust into a new world where you will have to gather resources and upgrade your arsenal. Night in Terraria is not as forgiving as Minecraft. After you survive you will continue to build up your personal collection while building a house. You will build a house so that random people can move in take up a room and rip you off with prices (jk not all prices are bad). Eventually you shall fight your first boss and bosses in Terraria will give you a run for your money so you better be prepared guys and gals. 

[h1] Singleplayer/Multiplayer	[/h1]

Terraria is a fun game and even more fun with friends. Friends will help you out and make it easier to advance without dying.... too much :D. However if you do not feel like playing multiplayer singleplayer is just as fun. In single player you do not have to share your loot and your friends are incapable of stealing it, because it is singlepalyer.

[h1]  Hardmode	[/h1]

Hardmode is a gamemode that Terraria automatically places you in after you beat The Wall of Flesh. In Hardmode you will meet new bosses and new enemies. You will find new materials and you will quickly realize every is much tougher and you need to quickly upgrade yourself.

[h1]  Rating	[/h1]

[b] Pros	[/b]
+ Smooth gameplay
+ Have not felt lag as of yet
+ character customization
+ huge amount of weapons
+ HARDCORE
+ entertaining for hours 
+ huge amount of armour sets with special abilities

[b] Cons	[/b]
- a lot to grasp for a new player to Terraria (I dont think i can think of any more)

[h1]  Final Thoughts	[/h1]

Terraria is an amazing 2D sandbox that tests you. This game has given me hours upon hours of fun and I would gladly recommend this game to anyone who has money in their wallet. 

[b] Final Rating 10/10	[/b]
I NEVER expected this game to be as complex as it is!

At first I checked it out and was like "Yeah, this looks kinda like Minecraft in 2D" and I got into exploring the world, finding items and quickly realized there is WAY MORE than I expected. 

In the beginning, farming wood and my first ore the game felt kinda slow, but once I looted some chests in the underground bioms and got some movement items for faster running or double jumps I was hooked for it.
I built myself a base, gathered more npcs, crafted better weapons, armor and fought the first bosses. I died a lot but kept on going because it was so much fun. 

I convinced a friend to buy the game and we explored the world together, progressed further into the bioms and found new gear everytime. 

Do I recommend this game?
Yes! Absolutely! If you don't mind the slow beginning and love exploring and experimenting with new stuff this game is for you!

PS: There are some pretty amazing items inthe game, if you get far enough! :D
This is a review seeing just how terrible Minecraft is in terms of content in comparison to Terraria.

It's bad.

On to my personal opinion (if you really do care): Mixed opinions. I prefer Minecraft for the building and the survival. Terraria has a good array of things you can use to build but I like to use Minecraft because of the complexity of machinery you can make using all the complicated gizmos and gadgets in it. As for survival, it's exceptionally fun in Terraria but I like it in Minecraft as well due to the sheer size and randomness of a world. In Terraria everything is more or less always the same; corruption/crimson, hell, space, etc. but in Minecraft there are so many more places to choose from! But all the same, Terraria can be fun too.

So, opinions aside, due to our comparisons...
[b] TERRARIA WINS!... [/b]
[i] ...right? [/i]

You see, it isn't about who has more of what. It's about the way to play. The way to enjoy it. You enjoy building, being creative, making pixel art? Play Minecraft, it's the perfect game for you. Don't have much taste for being a super builder, but like adventuring, fighting, bosses, etcetera? Play Terraria.


...or uninstall both and get a job, loser
Don't buy this because you think it's 2D Minecraft. 

The only thing this game has in common with minecraft is that it's pixelated and blocky.

I can say after ~300 hours in this game, It's THE best 10$ value you will ever get.

Edit: This game is fun single player or in multiplayer but if you want the most fun play it with a friend or two. It's great.
Pros:
- Insane amount of content.
- Great combat.
- 14 fun and challenging bosses.
- Fun servers.

Final Verdict:
One of the best games I've played, lots of fun, lots of replayability, and a ton of content, this game is worth it at ANY price, for the $2.50 I payed for the game I got an great amount of hours out of it and more for most $60 AAA games.

10/10.
People always love to make the comparision of Terraria and Minecraft. If you ever played this game, you'll know that they shouldn't be compared. In fact, for a single player experience, i'd say Terraria beats Minecraft hands down. But this isn't about Minecraft, so i'll list a few things as to why Terraria is great.
Terraria is for those who love the idea of growing and becoming stronger the more you play. In the beginning, you're pretty much helpless, killing the weakest enemies in multiple hits. You move slugglishly, and minor heights and caverns are truly intimidating. In the end, you are a force to be reckoned with, capable of taking down hoards of enemy after enemy mithout even pressing a button - diving to the deepest parts of the world and traversing every terrain with ease. 
The change is gradual, and each challenge is tougher than the last. But if you're up for the grind - and its a fun one at that - then Terraria is for you. 

A game developed and published by Re-Logic.

Terraria, an interesting title, where your imagination determines how far you can progress, and how much time you will pour into this game. A hollow world till you arrive, teeming with precious ores, and dark secrets. Fetid swamps and dry deserts. 
This game is definitely an endeavour, and it will soak up alot of your time as you try and reach the pinnacle of your characters limitations and how much you can construct. Often remarked as a "2D Minecraft" I always find this comparison woefully incorrect. Minecraft has a wide selection of enemies, which is similar, A wide array of ore and precious gems to mine, which is also similar. But from then one, Terraria leaves it dead in the water. An RPG experience, with substantial boss progression, Active try and retry game mechanics and spanning character classes, All inclusive of a massive crafting system, and wide assortment of things to collect and try. 
Anyways, I've praised it enough, lets get down to the review!

Graphics: Probably one of the weaker points of the game, Its still very vibrant and holds upto despite its 2011, Birthdate.
This is mainly due to the pixelated graphics and 2D perspective of the game. Not alot to render, and not alot to process at any one time, Making it run very smoothly at any point in time, But also extremely limited due to there not being any sort of graphical options or benchmarks.

Gameplay: Where do i begin. This game plays, as well as you can play it. All the mechanics are there for you to make it work in your favor. But finding your niche and finding your work space is all crucial in you enjoying your time in Terraria.
The game drops you into a world, where you basically don't understand anything, A very limited spread of understanding, very few tools at your disposal, and a single NPC to help guide you along your journey. 4 classes to basically choose from as you progress through the game, Melee, Ranged, Mage and Summoner. All depending on how you want to play and how you prefer to play. Despite there being no relevant story or backstory to this game, there is a substantial amount of progression and ALOT of gear to rummage around for.

Story: I think i pretty much covered this aspect of the game already. There really isn't a story here. Which is usually a game killer for me. I heavily invest in story driven worlds, And this world has none to speak of. I guess the story can be made up for each player, as to why you are doing what you're doing, but as for a story driven narrative. There isn't one.

I don't often do a "CONS" section. But this game is so monstrous in terms of scope and size, I feel it's necessary to provide as much information as possible. I love this game to bits, this is perhaps the 3rd time i've played it through, Once on playstation, once on Xbox and now on PC. So i'm well aware of his rather frustrating flaws.
So here we are....
Cons: This game despite how much effort has been poured into it, Has rather sizable and numerous flaws. Mostly relating around achievement glitches, game crashing and multiplayer bugs.
Achievement glitches are fairly frustrating, although are entirely not a concern unless you're as OCD as i am. The game progresses the same way regardless of steams registering of your progress.
Game crashes for alot of players at certain intervals in the game, Which HAS caused loss of character saves. It's highly recommended that you cloud save your favorite character builds and worlds, so that your save data will always be present.
And Multiplayer as a whole is a fairly awful experience, the above mention bugs as well as an assortment of new things, Players not seeing what each other are seeing, Enemies and bosses despawning because of numerous players involved, which may or may not potentially ruin hours upon hours of preparation and planning. Frustrating to say the least. But alot of it is avoidable if you take necessary precautions. Alot of which can be found through quick internet searches.

Overall: This game is a gigantic time suck lol
There is no other way to put it, You will pour time into boss by boss progression, farming and grinding enemies for specific gear to better improve your chances at the next boss. You will dig deep into dirt, mud and ash for hours upon hours just to find 3 pieces of ore which isn't even close to the amount you need. You will kill thousands of enemies for a single piece of gear, that isn't even optimal till you find another piece it can be fused with. You will die on the inside for days and potentially weeks as you farm your way to the very end of the game. And then when it's all over and you finally can get a breath of respite as your real life world is crumbling to pieces around you, You will feel empty, knowing that it's done.
This game isn't just worth its price, It's worth every minute you pour into it.
Welcome to Terraria. I hope you enjoy it as much as i do.
If your focus is on gameplay rather than on graphics then this game is for you.
If you want a cool game and not a mind fucking shit then this game is for you.
If you are a creative person and dont like spoon feeding then this game is for you.
If you like adventures and explorations rather than instant actions then this game is for you.
If you like a value for money game and dont want to spend a big amount then this game is for you.
If you like killing zombies and monsters with your own made weapons then this game is for you.
If you want to play on your old laptop and cant afford heavy rig then this game is for you.
If you want to make a world of your own then this game is for you.
If you want to play alone or with your friends as well then this game is for you.
TOTALLY RECOMMENDED.
After all these years I can tell Terraria is one of the best, well done and most entertaining games of its kind out here!
I still remember the days when killing skeletron was considered endgame, good days. The devs've made an insane progress since then and only for the best - I couldn't imagine Terraria would turn into such content rich and entertaining sandbox.

Why do I reccomend it? That's why:
- Fast paced, stylish (even though very simple) combat
- Attractive pixel graphics
- Well done character/world progression
- Beautiful environment
- A lot to explore, every playthrough is somewhat different
- Great soundtrack
- You can build! And it actually has a purpose!
- Every boss is forever in my heart<3
- Customize character looks (very important for me)
- Even better with friends
- And the last, but not the least - the game doesn't require a NASA computer to play it

10 slimes out of 10 slimes! Will definitely play it again, over and over.
You can nuke waves of zombies with explosive bunnies.
You can stone Santa Claus to death with rotten eggs.
You can assassinate your enemies with bananas.
You must sacrifice your first friend to the lava of hell in order to progress. 
And one of the bosses is a pig, dragon, shark chimera named Duke Fishron.

Play it already.
This is literally God's gift to video games. You can have over 1,000 hours in this game and still be surprised. The amount of content is frankly ASTOUNDING. The complexity, depth, and sheer magnitude of this game blows my mind every time I play it. There isn't a story, but there is clearly lore to uncover. You'll mostly be mining, fighting, building, and testing your creativity with different combinations of weapons and movement systems. There are many different types of armor which allow you to move in many different ways, which allows you to enhance your combat abilities against different enemies and just traverse the land / explore more easily. There are 83 different wearable movement items, to be exact.... 

Just kidding, that's JUST THE NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WINGS. AND WINGS AREN'T EVEN THE ONLY ITEMS THAT ENABLE YOU TO FLY. 

There's rocket boots, hoverboards, rideable animals, space ships... Magical staffs, bows, swords, axes, rifles, fucking machine guns, etc. The list of movement & combat items goes on forever, There are SO many different enemies, interesting bosses, and ways to fight them. The ONLY people in the world who won't enjoy this game are people who don't enjoy mining/exploring, or people who just hate platformers regardless of how good they are. If you're not one of those people, buy this game.

I was confused when I first played, so here's my TLDR run-down of the game if you don't understand what the goal is (Assuming you're starting in a new world with a fresh character):
Start with a few basic tools, build yourself a house (preferably multiple houses) which, once certain requirements are met, NPCs will move into. These NPCs will offer you different benefits and sell you interesting items, some of which are exclusive to them. The bosses in the world can either be summoned with different items, or will spawn in front of you once certain requirements are met. You want to beat the bosses for mainly 2 reasons: They drop amazing items, and/or they allow you to get certain new NPCs to move into your house. For example, defeating the Queen Bee will cause the Witch Doctor NPC to move into your house, who will sell you a great pair of Wings when you put him in a Jungle biome at night (yes, the Wiki is your best friend). So the goal of the game is to keep getting better metals/materials to make yourself better weapons/armor so you can beat stronger enemies/bosses so you can keep getting better metals/materials and so on. Once you beat the Wall of Flesh boss (which you have to summon in the Underworld by throwing a Voodoo Doll into a pit of lava), your entire world - including most enemies and metal ores - will change to Hardmode, and you'll pretty much feel like you're starting over again because enemies will once again be able to kick your ass and more bosses will become available to fight and more items will become available to craft. 

That's just the surface level of the game, but that's the best general explanation I can give for people who are still like "wtf is this game, what is my goal, what do I do" because that's how I felt when I first played.

If you want a great explanation of why I love this game in video format, check out "Terraria - Best video game ever made" on YouTube by Maj0rLee. I'm not affiliated with him, it's just a great video about the game if you're still on the fence. 


P.S. If you think this game looks appealing to you but you're more interested in a more linear, story-driven experience, check out Starbound. It's also really good, and is similar in its scope/style.
This is probably one of the best Games here on Steam.

I first bought this Game back in 2013 and after dying a couple of times I didnt touch it for a while. However after playing it with a friend I discovered what a gem it really is.

Terraria is a 2D Adventure, Survival, Crafting Game that is just perfect in every way. It also is very optimised and recieved lots of updates making building (Thank you for the smart Cursor) & moving around the world (Thank you for the different mounts) alot easier.

Terraria is so Cheap but you can spend so much time on it. It basically is never ending fun and now with the achievements it will be easy ish to get 100%. The only grinding bit will be the fishing quests you'll need to do. 

There is honestly so much to do and it is an absolut gem. You just have to try it out yourself and if you dont want to spend 10€ (which is already really cheap for this kind of game) then you can always wait for a sale and grab it there!

Now this Game might not have the best "graphics" but it is lovely the way it is and it shouldn't be in any other way. 

I highly recommend this Game to any Minecraft, Metroidvania & 100% Achievement Fan. But even if you are not one of those, the Chances that you will dislike this Game are very low! So just give it a shot!
I've put lots of time into this game, even before I bought it on Steam. When I did finally get it on Steam, I purchased two copies: one for myself, and one for my wife. We played together, helping each other collect health and mana upgrades, equipment upgrades, and collecting the NPCs. She fought off slimes and zombies while I established gardens for mushrooms, trees, and plants for potion ingredients. We mined, we explored dungeons and caves, we fought bosses and discovered how to navigate Hell.

It's been an amazing time, and this game has been well worth the amount of money I've spent on it. I've gotten more hours of enjoyment out of it, both alone and with my wife, than I have with nearly every $60 AAA game. The music, the graphics, the controls, and the amount of stuff available to do just make it an easy recommendation for me.
For a 10 dollar game it's really good. trust me i wasted days on this.
anyway if you plan on buying it then you should know a bit about it.
so i will tell you about it.



Customization:
You can basically change the colors of stuff. not much about it.


Combat:
For a sandbox game there are alot of enemies to fight, some are just recolors of other enemies, but most of them have unique drops, some even drop items that are good early or later on. some enemies are difficult at first but you will probably destroy them later on.


Story:
There is no story...but that cant stop you from making your own. i have seen alot of people asking on the community for people to roleplay with them. they give a story and everything. but for the most part there is no story. so there's that.


NPCS (Non Player Characters):
There are alot of NPCS in the game and most of them are unique to get. some only come when you got alot of money. some just come out of nowhere. and some you have to go down to hell and throw powder at it to make them stop being a demon...normal stuff. and they sell you stuff too so that's good.


Building:
Building is somewhat important in this game. it allows you to attract NPCS to sell you stuff, make somewhere to store stuff, just have a place that wont get you murdered by the starting enemies. but if terraria didnt let you build then you would not have a game.

Mining:
So to build you need materials right? well this game has a crap ton of those, some you get from mining, some you craft, and some you gotta kill enemies for them. but mining allows you to  make bars and craft stuff so let's talk about that now.

Crafting:
So one of the reason this game is good to me is that you can craft a bunch of items in it, swords, bows, guns, staves, armor, accessories, useless vanity items. but if im being serious if you couldnt craft this would be trash.


Mounts/Pets:
Chances are you kill a boss and you get something like a Slimy Saddle (actual item) and you use it. and a slime comes out of nowhere and you ride it. boom it's a mount. almost always a mount will be dropped by a boss/enemy. Pets are like mounts but useless. they still get dropped by enemies and bosses, but sometimes chests have them too.

Events:
Sometimes at night or day in terraria you will get a text saying something like "You feel an evil presence watching you.". well that's an event people. an event in terraria is when the game decides to throw obstacles and mountains of enemies at you. they do provide some good loot sometimes though. or summon bosses.

Multiplayer:
Multiplayer it like it sounds, multiple people in one game. the multiplayer has a few features. like teams (so you can fight to the death) more people to help you kill things or build...and that's actually it.

Expert Mode:
Expert Mode is basically just the entire game...but everything can kill you easily. there are more rewards though. bosses give special items now. sometimes you can get developer sets to show off to your friends and you die more! you should probably play the game a bit before using this mode.

Hard Mode:
So after you kill a boss (not saying it) the game will put you in hardmode. basically adding new enemies, ores and making every pre-hard mode enemy stronger, i recommend getting really good armor, gear, and weapons before advancing to this mode (because if you kill the boss you dont have a choice)


Classes:
Classes are basically just 4 different types and they basically say what they are. "warrior" using melee weapons and being tanky, "ranger" using mostly guns, bows, and crossbows, "mage" using magic weapons to incinerate, freeze, or poison your foes, and finally "summoner" it's pretty much the mage class but you summon stuff to help destroy enemies. pick the one that suits you.





Conclusion:
In conclusion if you have some christmas cash or something then i recommend getting this game, if you can deal with the occasional hard parts of the game. this game is probably for you, the game isn't too hard and has a wide variety of things to do in it, if it's killing things for a collection, beating every boss, building really good houses, or making a successful server, the game has things for you to do, i personally recommend this game and you should get it.
This game is like a time machine, only that you can only go forward. 

For example, start playing at 8 pm. Blink. Now its 4 am.

See? Magic. 



I would rate this: my time played/10

Edit: Bought this 3 years ago. Still playing it. Cost me 1.6$
Terraria is the first game i got on steam, and im not disappointed.

I think everyone should have this game.

There is hundreds of hours worth of  gameplay without modding nowadays and then there is the multiplayer servers, which add another level of fun to the game.

You can setup your own private server through the game to play with friends, or download a server to setup so you can use commands.

You can mod the game using TModloader and then the possibilities are endless, make your own mod, or download one!

like i said, i think everyone should have this game and i reccomend it for everyone, to solo and multiplayer people.
Pros- 
Cool Soundtrack
Multiplayer actually works
Boss fights
NPC personalitys
Thousands of Items
Gameplay that keeps you interestedd
=============
Cons- 
Its so good that its takes up hundreds of hours of your life 
=============


Don't listen to people who say it's a rip-off of some other game. This game isn't like anything I've seen before. It's worth your time, trust me.
(Edit: I took out the part that says unicorns because no.)
(Edit 2: This has gotten popular so I thought I'd mention that when you go mining hot dang those are some nice sounds "click click tick click tick tick click")
Huge amount of content, procedurally generated worlds, quite a few choices in playstyles for characters in the late game when you get kit that provides specific bonuses to damage types, lots of bosses, lots of mobs, lots of buffs/debuffs, quite a few techniques to master, a good feel of progression across hours of play, active development (after a long hiatus in the middle), and a good community. Building/crafting is intuitive and fast albeit 2d, and the game makes for a very fun co-op experience if you have friends to play with.

At its price bracket, the value for time spent is phenomenal if you like the idea of a 2d sandbox platformer with boss fights and the excitement of the next loot drop. Difficulty scales nicely (and has an "expert" mode for those that find the default game a bit easy), World size is variable, and the penalty on dying can be chosen from "drop some money and nothing else" to "your character is dead, please start again".

One of the nicest features of Terraria is the ability to have characters and worlds that aren't tied to each other. So if you're looking for a specific item that doesn't seem to be on your world, you can just generate a new one, take your character there to farm for items, and then go back to your main world - or you can start a brand new character on a world you've already built up with NPCs and everything else rather than needing to completely start from scratch each time - not many games have managed to pull this off so well.

The game is also very kid friendly, and has been a fun family multiplayer game in this house many times over.

Summary

Excellent 2D platformer with crafting, boss fights, huge amounts of content from aesthetics to rare items and godly weapons, the ability to continually improve your character over hours of play, and well designed procedurally generated levels. Great single player experience, great multiplayer experience as long as you have other friends or family members to play with. Very cheap for the amount of content and game there is available.
Many people compare it to minecraft but its very diffrent, terraria has more content then minecraft, people who say its bad just because its 2D have no sense of gaming, the mods are also wonderful with QoL, huge mods that could take you months to complete and many more. Don't listen to people who say its bad because its 2D, watch people play it and judge it by what you saw, not what you heard
I love this game to death, I originally started playing this game when i had potato pc and the experience was great because at the time i couldnt play newer games without 5fps. The community for this game are super friendly and this is a game that is a must have for everyone who uses steam.
Terraria used to be all about the adventuring part of the game, going out fighting different monsters, finding new biomes and gathering material. However after all the updates theres a ton of stuff to do if you're just looking for building as well, the game is currently sitting at 3000+ different items, including weapons, armor, building blocks etc.

[b]PROS:[/b]
[list]
  [*]Boss fights are super cool
  [*]Lots of items
  [*]LOOT
  [*]A lot of fun with friends
  [*]Game is cheap compaired to the amount of gameplay
  [*]On sale pretty often.
[/list]

[b]CONS:[/b]
[list]
  [*]None that I can think of.
[/list]

Game is cheap compaired to the amount of gameplay it has, and its even on sale pretty often.

[i]I'd recommend this over Minecraft anyday of the week.[/i]
The overwhelming amount of positivity this game has recieved is well-deserved. For a 2D side-scroller, the game has much, much more going for it than you'd expect, initially. To make the cake even sweeter, you can install community-created Mods, which not only add more to do in the game, but more often than not add a whole new level of challenge and exploration that'll surely catch you off-guard.

I cannot recommend this game enough. I previously only spent about ten minutes in the game, however after getting into it with some friends and discovering all it had to give, I put over a hundred hours, and I enjoyed every second of it.

If you're on the fence about buying the game, definitely do so. It may seem simple and odd on the surface, but once you get into it, you're treated to one of, if not [b]the[/b] best retro survival game of all time!


Forgot to mention, not only is the community still thriving, but the game is still getting updated, and will be updated from here on out. Even so, there's [i]plenty[/i] of mods to fit your fancy.



If I was to give it a number out of 10, I'd honestly give it a 10


[i][b]One of the best games I've ever played, and it didn't even cost more than $10[/b][/i]
Probably best 2D sandbox ever made. The amount of items you can craft or get and enemies you can defeat (including bosses) is just sometimes overwhelming.

The game has 2 stages :

1) Pre-hardmode - basically a longer "tutorial" where you learn basics such as crafting, fighting monsters and exploring biomes, this stage ends when you kill certain boss in the underground called wall of flesh.

2) Hardmode - the real game begins here, monsters are stronger and new biomes appear, a lot of game content unlocks only in this mode. This stage remains forever (or you can count defeating the last boss as a end of it).

There are a lot of decorative items and furniture so builders won't be dissapointed though I was focused more on exploring and fighting rather than building.

Highly recommend this game but be careful - its addictive :)
Terraria is easily capable of providing hours of entertainment. My impression prior to buying it was that it was a 2D minecraft clone, but after playing it, I prefer it to minecraft. But comparing to minecraft, as is often done, doesn't seem very fair to me, because they are two very different experiences. Terraria can be played in many different ways, and I'd expect that most people can find a way to enjoy it. Whether you prefer to take it slowly and cautiously, farming herbs and brewing potions, or prefer to role the dice, diving through caves and looting randomly generated structures, Terraria can be about exploration, collection, boss fighting, base defending, and much more. 

You start out by creating a character. The customization is limited, but not too limited. You can have multiple characters, and you can skip this by randomizing or choosing the default skin, but it doesn't take very long. You can then create a world (or multiple), choosing between normal and expert mode (as its name suggests, expert mode is not forgiving to newer players). The world has many different regions to explore, each with their own dangers and treasures. Between islands in the sky, a bug-infested jungle, a terrifying evil (which begins to spread later, there are two variants), and much more, you probably won't be bored by it for some time.

The game has many mechanics to make it interesting. You can start a town of NPCs and complete quests for them or buy goods from them. You can fish up a meal or some treasure. You can acquire tools which you can use to wire up traps or farms. There are many events the player can defend against of varying difficulties throughout the game, and even more bosses to fight. There are literally thousands of different items and accessories to customize your playstyle; although there are only four main classes to choose from for the majority of the game, these being mage, ranged weaponist, mele fighter, and summoner (although summoner items are usually more difficult to obtain).

I personally have put in almost a thousand hours, but I don't believe you need to put in even ten hours to get your money's worth. If you're having any difficulties while playing, the game has a massively helpful wiki, and a friendly community.
You are thrown into an open world without explanation, without instructions and without a goal, but trust me: soon enough you'll find out that you need to fight to survive, craft your own weapons and armors, build a house, lock the door and then spend hours deciding which wallpaper better matches the bathtub that you just looted from the dungeon.

Life can be hard in an open world such as the one from Terraria. You could be preparing a Bowl of Soup in your new kitchen when all of a sudden an army of Goblins invade from the West. And you were not geared! They might end up killing Isis, the Party Girl, and you kinda had a thing for her, but that's okay, that's just a game. She *will respawn*.

This game consists of exploring and exploring and exploring, and while you explore you'll find new enemies, new materials or ores to craft new accessories, gear, potions, vanity item, decorations for your house. 

You can set up traps, build intricate mechanism and wiring (check around Terraria Teleporter Hub). You will face pretty challenging bosses, which will throw you in the search for more powerful gear to defeat him.

And after you done it all, you'll realize that Crimson Blocks are much cooler than the blocks you used to build your main Quarter in your Base. And you will rebuild it all again.

I've found the Multiplayer pretty cool, but for that you'd need to have friends who play at the same pace as you. It is not fun if one of you got much better gear than the others. 

The achievements are right on spot, apart from the "Supreme Helper Minion" which befits the level of a trained monkey. Devs should learn that brainless repetition is hardly a challenge.

The Linux port is pretty good. I've had some hiccups while starting the game every now and then, but once it started it went smooth.
Overall : 9/10
A friend recommended this game, but I was hesitant to buy it at first. It looked like a minecraft ripoff in a 2D world.
The large amount of positive reviews and the low prive (4.99 euro at that time) convinced me to give this a try.

I could not have been more wrong. This game is awesome !
The amount of content, the freedom, the difficulty level, the items and achievements you can collect, all of this make it one of the best games I have ever played.

You can:
      1 Create large buildings
      2 Collect loads of items, weapons and armor
      3 Explore a huge map
      4 Become a badass warrior and defeat enormous bosses
      5 ...

One thing I really like is what changes if you play on the highest difficulty level.
Ofcours everything gets a lot harder, but you are also able to get better and more drops (items) from enemies.
This feels like the game is rewarding you for playing on a higher difficulty.

There is even a multiplayer aspect, which makes it even better. It is really fun to play with friends.

Graphics : 8/10
Not too impressive, a 2D world map. The graphics itself are outdated but create the perfect atmosphere for this game.
You can create 2 types of worlds, which each have a different dark environment.
Multiple biomes (forest, jungle, desert, ...) exist, with its own unique enemies and environment.

Optimization : 9/10
Good optimization, 60 fps on 1440p-max on a gtx 980 (overclocked) with v-sync on.
Without v-sync, the fps went up to a stable 165 fps, but for some reason playing on 60 fps is more enjoyable.

Story : 2/10
This is where the game is lacking at the moment. Actually no story exists, you are free to create your own :)

Length : 10/10
I killed the final boss after 125 hours on the highest difficulty. This is awesome for a game where I payed 4.99 for.
The game is not finished though. I can still perfect my house, kill other bosses, collect items, explore some more...

I have around 180 games in my steam library, after 2 weeks this game is in the top 3 of most played games.
Enough said.

Replayablity : 10/10
Each world you create, is unique because they are created based upon a "seed".
As stated above, each world has its unique dark environment. The type is selected upon world creation.
There are [spoiler]21[/spoiler] different type of ores, but each world will only contain [spoiler]13[/spoiler].
This means each world will play differently and you need to create a lot of worlds to be able to collect all the items in the game.

Because of this you will never be able to see al the content and achievements on your first playthrough.
I'm going to be honest, at first I hated this game. I mean, absolutely despised it. But believe me, when I started crafting better gear, fighting new mobs, and building my home, I became immersed in Terraria. There's an endless amount of content here for only $9.99 and if you were like me thinking this was just a 2D Minecraft rip-off, you couldn't be more wrong. Definitely a must play. (And yes, like always, the PC version is far superior of the console versions.)
Honestly thought I wouldn't like Terraria as I don't play these types of games... 
BUT This was amazing. And Spent a few hours playing 
Huge amount of content, There is almost hundreds of hours worth of gameplay.

TBH One of the best games I've ever played, and it didn't even cost more than $10
Would highly recommend to anyone, I think everyone should have this game.
First hours of playing Terraria

''What the hell is that?'' 

''What the hell does this do?'' 

''What the hell did i just do?''

''Why did that happen?'' 

''Who is this?''

''How do i [Insert something here]?''

''How did i do that?''


Okay, out of all of the games in the library this is probably the one with the most hours I have logged into in terms of gameplay. This game is NOT 2D Minecraft, no matter what you've heard. In my opinion, Terraria is significantly better than Minecraft and I'm honestly still disappointed to hear that this game's spinoff was cancelled.

Things this game has:
Guns
Summonables
Tools and accessories, too many to keep track of
Great modpacks
In a sense, a 3D feature (wall placement)
Endless opportunities, there's so much shit you can do it's not even funny

You can't have a strong Steam library without this game, it's fun to play on your own and even more fun with friends. There's a lore that surrounds the several unexplained aspects of this game and that makes it even better. There isn't a fanbase dictated by snot-nosed 12 year olds, so all in all I can't really point out any major flaws (as the ones I can point out are generally fixable with mods)
Terraria looks like your typical sandbox crafting game. And it might've been that in the early patches. But after the Hardmode update everything changed. In my opinion that's when Terraria became its own game. It feels like an RPG, with rare loot, bosses and classes, but with a twist which would be the crafting and base-building. It's way more complex than it looks, and at the same time it's really accessible. You can play it very casually or go deeper (for example checking wiki for droprates on X item, best prefixes for weapon, mechanics on world spawning, etc). 

It has everything you need for a great adventure game, tons of items, weapons and enemies, and unique bosses with different AIs. And if you think the game is too easy there's Expert mode (which in my opinion, it's the way the game is meant to be experienced). Hardcore runs are also a thing but keep in mind it's really hard to play with no deaths (looking at you boulder traps). You finished the game and want more content? Worry not, there's Mod support (really easy to get into, just search tModloader on google and after you install it there's a mod browser in game). Finally, multiplayer mode. Terraria is a great solo game but even better multiplayer. Since there's multiple classes, you can make a party with your friends and share items that don't fit your class, explore together, farm bosses, etc.

Overall, Terraria is a great sandbox adventure game, with a lot of replayability, specially with mods (Calamity, Thorium and Fargo's are my personal favorites). The game is still being updated to this day (currently June 2018) which show the devs really care about their game. The only con I can think about is that the early game is kinda slow. Takes a while to get going. I personally don't feel it but I heard complaints about it. Really recommend it 10/10 game.
There are only two legitimate reasons for not owning this game. 

1. "I don't have any money or generous friends." 

2. "I use an actual toaster for a PC and thus can't run it."

That's it.

If you have the money, but don't own this game. Fix that. ASAP.
[h1] Dankest Sandbox Game EVER [/h1]

This is by far one of the best Sandbox games I've [u] EVER [/u] played!
My 1200 Hours can speak for itself.
Asside from the fact that there is no clear guidelines on how to progress.
It is very appealing to look at [For me atleast], Ive played hundreds and hundreds of hours
on [b] Terraria. [/b] Ive played multiplayer with up to 8 mates all smashing our way through
the world, Everything is pretty easy, Even when on Expert mode, But thats why you got such
things as mods, Thorium, Spirit and many others. Each boss has its own unique set of abilities
and style which is good, If youre looking for a new game to play whilst you got time, Id
highly suggest [b] Terraria, [/b] Mainly because you'll say "Im getting off in 10 minutes",
Meanwhile an hour later and you're still havent finished doing whatever it is you were going to do

Overall [u] Terraria [/u] is a great game, Highly recommended from my behalf

Happy gaming,
Toshi~
Ohhhhh my god where do I start with this game? I bought this game when I was first getting into Steam and believe me, I have never spent ten bucks better. There is so much to do in this game that make this so-called "Minecraft clone" unique and rewarding.

Here's what makes Terraria so engaging:

-5 bosses before it even gets "hard," took me about 30 hours
-gameplay is never repetitive or frustratingly difficult
-awe-inspiring ores and treasures that puts Minecraft diamond to shame
     -the moment you find something new and you can't get over how great it is, you'll find something better (you'll see 
       what I mean)
-fast-paced game progression
-80+ hours in one game and I haven't beaten it yet
-surprisingly intricate building (just google Terraria builds)

Just a few things to keep in mind if you're a completely new player:

-there's no tutorial, so prepare to bookmark the Terraria wiki
-it's way more fun to play co-op
-the first few hours are admittedly slow, but the game just gets better the longer you play
-yes, there is fall damage

Do yourself a favor and get this game.

Eat. Sleep. Terraria.
This game is SO AMAZING!!!! It has so many items and enemies and is so much fun to play! From a bunch of snowmen attacking you to golden animals that you can sell, this game is full of difficulty and randomness and downright addicting! It can get boring depending on how much you played but if you have friends to play with, nothing should be very boring at all! Most of the time you can make amazing buildings, wiring mechanisms, other NPC's can sell you cosmetics and potions and crafting stations that can help you along the way. This game is worth it and you will never regret getting this game!
Recieved this game as a gift from my friend long ago and I was very confused by it at first, but now down the road I look back at that time and think, wow this has been a great game for a long time. I would really reccomend this game, it's the right combination of know-how, skill and good ol fashion luck to keep me wanting to play again. Not to mention the item diversity makes multiplayer that much cooler!
Addictive and fun. Can get lost in this game for hours. 

Great for getting your mind off things.

There is always something to do, Build/Collect/Explore.
I can't recommend it enough. I have 55 friends who own this game and I don't know a single one who's regretted it. It's more than enough fun in singleplayer, but having a group makes this game even better. Multiplayer is super easy to just set up and go.
I couldn’t tell you how many times I’ve played this game and fought every boss, collected the most powerful tools, weaponry and armor, achieved all npcs and looted every dungeon.

This game feels so open and with no objective, you can roam the world and choose what you focus on. Whether it’s improving your house or collecting every piece of armor. This game has a lot to offer and how this game has grown since release is insane and don’t get me started on mods. This game is worth every penny for how much gameplay you get out of this game. The graphics make the game look very childish and the colours but it’s very much grown up for how the game is played like fighting bosses and the gathering of materials, it can be grindy. 

The game is about a player in a 2D pixelated world where the basis of the game is to fight monsters and bosses to get stronger. The progression to become more powerful throughout the game is very rewarding like hermes boots or wings, you appreciate the increased movement heavily and it becomes almost impossible to play without them once you become familiar. 

I love this game and have spent a lot of time with friends which makes the game even better. The loot isn’t shared on multiplayer which is a bit awkward at times when loot is rare, sometimes people will be ahead based on the luck of chests but this can become easier when that person assists you on finding the same item. This game is enjoyable in single player but is always better with friends but the aim is to become strong enough to fight the wall of flesh. This game will constantly have you searching up items and crafting with the extensive amount of items in the game which adds to the playability. The game will grow on you as you play since the start up of the game is slow compared to the ending but it leaves for more invested time in your character. The satisfaction of having a armor set and upgrading defence or obtaining good items like horseshoe or cloud in a jar. These equipable items are very helpful and necessary at the start to climbing to higher and stronger enemies. 

In conclusion, this game is very enjoyable but the world feels boring on a 2D environment. The startup for the game is slow especially when playing the game before. It is very rewarding if you play the game out and slowly upgrade, the fishing challenges is a nice touch to something different to fighting since the game is mostly killing and mining. I hate to say it but has a formula like minecraft but I feel this game has more content and the mods are insane. They add even more gameplay to the game with more items, ores and more.

7/10

It's one of those games, who you start off having no idea what you have to do, and end up sinking hundreds of hours. One of those (few) games that its developers love so much that they keep updating it. One of those games that everyone must try.

[b]9.5/10[/b]
Definitely worth the money, and there are so many features and possibilities that you can play it for hundreds and thousands of hours without it getting boring. Hundreds of different blocks, weapons, items, cosmetics, accessories, enemies and 29 different bosses, with 14 events to fight against.

Gameplay is definitely a 10/10, with smooth controls, amazing items, neat accessories, building blocks, everything.

Replayability is also a 9.5/10, because you can make self-imposed challenges, such as "Magic weapons only" or "No crafting." Along with that, there are nearly endless possibilities as to what world you might get. There are so many unique worlds that you could play the game for years and still not get the same world twice.

Graphics are an 8.5/10, although everything is made in 16-bit design, the simple graphics still get the job done fairly well.

Community is about 9.5/10, there are so many amazing artists who draw fanart, so many amazing youtubers who make such great videos, and so many great players who have all chipped in to make this game what it is today.

Computer requirements are close to nothing. I can play this game on a nintendo switch and still have room for Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Odyssey on there.

Hope this review was helpful, and remember that this game is well worth your money.













my only problem though is thOSE GODDAMN WORMS
What can I say guys. This game is just so super rewarding. Awesome replayability value. Tons of contents. You will end up playing hundreds of hours and never get bored. There aren't that many games like that any more :D
Easily one of the most compelling games to spend all your free time to. Have played this game on and off for years now and it always finds a way to pull you back into the action. I was gifted this game by a dear friend years ago way before all the hardmode additions and the Expert Mode feature were a thing and I'll just say: One of the best things of all time. So much in fact I've bought 4-packs of this game before and given them to people because everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, should deserve a chance to experience this classic.
Good game, very addicting.
Though once you've defeated Moonlord there's nothing much to be done unless you furnish your world or make new character and world.
I WISH I HAD MORE FRIENDS TO PLAY WITH THIS GAME
So much more than a 2D Minecraft Clone.

Terraria is a sandbox-survival adventure game. It feature the classic collect materials and build stuff gameplay. But instead of a 3D environment it has a 2D perspective. Released in 2011, Terraria is one of Re-Logic most successful game with millions of copies sold and many different ports onto a various selection of gaming platforms. Personality I love the game most since it features gameplay I enjoy, mine material, make weapons and armor, and take down evil forces.

Gameplay in Terraria is a pretty standard by now. chop down wood, make a house, build tools and gear, mine for ores, and defeat monsters. But while it is very common nowadays its still very solid and a perfect way to increase your hours. Speaking of crafting, there is so much stuff you can craft, such as different blocks, crafting materials, different weapons, and utility items. There are also plenty of different NPCs to house and in return you can purchase items from them with the currency system.

Include are plenty of biomes with different types of enemies and extra goodies, like Pyramids in the Desert biome  or the Underground section of the lush Jungle biome. There are also 3 types of special biomes. Crimson and Corruption will eat your world if they're not handle, one has a very bloody theme while the other features a more dark theme. Then there is the Hallow with bright colors, Pixies, and murderous Unicorns, luckily this Biome unlock in Hardmode which I will get to later.

Another cool thing about Terraria is the many invasions and Bosses. Invasions can happen randomly during gameplay but they can be manually summoned and feature a onslaught of unique enemies which is very useful for grinding for currency or other items. Some invasions have mini-bosses as a part of the action. Now with the Bosses. Terraria's Bosses are crucial to proceed with the game, as their defeat activates certain things in the overworld. Most of the Pre-Hardmode are pretty easy once you have the right gear but the Hardmode Bosses offer a greater challenge. However I do wish you didn't have to defeat them in order to make something happen, just a tiny inconvenience.

Now I should talk about Hardmode, once you defeat the Wall of Flesh, a special boss in the Underworld, the game kickstarts into Hardmode with tougher enemies and bosses but with more biome and better gear. I'd say that 70% of the game is in Hardmode so, be prepared to be challenged. Speaking of which there is the Expert mode with is even tougher but has some special items you cannot get from the other modes of the game.

Visually, I love the pixel art-style for this game, it has kinda stuck over time but that does help the developers make some gorgeous looking pixel art for the bosses, as they are huge compared to the player. The background are also a fun part for the eyes as there are different background for each biome.

The Soundtrack is also very constructed with some memorable tunes, I won't get much here as the soundtrack itself is reviewable.

Overall, Terraria's success comes from is simple, yet effective gameplay with mining and defeating monsters. Pretty much anyone could pick up and play this game as its presentation is great for new players. And if the content isn't enough for you there are always Mods and they have shown to be very, very expansive. I kinda wish this game gets Workshop support to make getting said mods a bit easier but I digress. Terraria is well worth its 10$ price tag, but its sale price of $5 is even more incredible considering what you get in the base game.

I've had this game for about six years, and I've beat it countless times. Yet, it still manages to entertain me for hours on end. It's the perfect combination of exploring, grinding, fighting, and crafting. If you have even the slightest consideration to buy this game, without a doubt, do it.
This game is a big recommend from me, you can waste hours on this game doing the simplest of things. At first game is a bit slow and can require some strategy to traverse the land, which can be very fun if you get better at it, and getting tools to help you with traversing the land can be very useful. There is plenty of items in this game which could be gear, weapons, blocks, and even just simple items to goof around with. I have played 700+ hours currently and I haven't gotten bored yet, some people have 1000+ hours. This game has plenty of challenge especially in hardmode, with bosses and even some enemies being very difficult if you don't know their attacks and didn't prepare. After defeating a boss your world will go into hardmode permanently, and whole array of new things become available to you along with new bosses as I mentioned earlier.
Even if it's a 2d game, you can build some really amazing stuff in this game with all the blocks you can find in this game. After a while, you can build houses for NPCs if you meet curtain requirements, like increasing your max health for a nurse, or having an amount of coins on you, etc. The bosses in this game get really cool and have some nice drops that you look can look forward to and then have fun after you get them, it's usually a really good reward in the stage of the game you kill the boss in. This game can get really complex sometimes with crafting recipes and such, you can go to the first NPC the guide for crafting recipes, but you may want to look on the wiki sometimes. The guide can lead you in the right direction if you're not sure what to do if you do actually talk to him, if you get bored of the game, you can always try waiting a month or so, creating a new character with a challenge in mind, downloading some mods, or multiplayer, multiplayer can be very fun.
This game is actually INCREDIBLE. I held back for so long, but one day my friend gifted it to me so we could play and I was shocked. It is not a Minecraft clone, it's very original and has way, way more to offer than Minecraft, or any other building game on the platform. The only thing I can think of coming close is Blockland, but thats a different style. It's awesome how many things you can do. There are tons of different ores, other crafting materials (E.G Shark Fin), weapons, tools, armour, and other things you can craft with. Also almost everything can be put into huge stacks and the amount of enemies, bosses, and treasure you can collect makes the game feel fresh everytime. This is probably the best game I've played in years. If you like these kind of games where you craft and survive PLEASE buy this if you can.
i like the game i have played it for 4 or 3 maybe 5 years, good game just one thing please make Terraria steam workshop accessible, because Tmodloader is to hard to use. so just make it so we can get mods for Terraria easier that's all i really like the game  (:
i'd say Minecraft is a very good game, but this game is way better, even better then this memy face
<-
Minecraft compared to Terraria, is kinda boring

In Minecraft and Terraria you become a god but in Terraria you also SLAY gods 

Judge me if you want but this game is so good that i played over 800 hours of it (in a couple days)
i play this game way way to much it's amazing there isn't a single bad thing i can say there are many different ways to play from classes such as:Melee,Ranger,Mage,Summoner and even Throwing you can also do various challenges like sword only (because in melee there are spears, projectile swords, yoyos and stuff)or staff only there is so much content i recommend for everyone to try if you do get it i hope you're having fun!!!!! :) read comments for more info.
A sword that spews cats meke this game a 10/10 game
The down side is that a 9 year old beat me up for playing this instead minecraft 6/10 that my final score
I'm not really a person who likes to play 2D retro games so at first I was a bit skeptic about playing it at all. But as I was learning more about the content and how actually deep and fun this game is, I've realized there's no such graphic in the world that can replace a good feeling when you play such game as Terraria is. 
If I would compare it to other sandbox adventure games, I would say the time you spend digging and building stuff isn't hideous at all (doesn't feel like grinding), looks pretty and colorful, bosses encounters are challenging and fun and you can run across some very unique mechanisms, which, if you're engineer at heart like me, would be very interesting for you.
Overall, I would recommend to try the game, buy it if you want to support the devs.
This is one of the games that everyone should give it a try whether they like the type or not, I myself thought I wouldn't like it and would get bored soon, but damn boy was I wrong!
if you buy this game, you'll go back to it after like a couple of years of not playing it and get goosebumps when you hear the soundtrack after so long and you will say "i miss this game". Instant classic this game is. Also way better than Minecraft.
Ok... I’ve beeen playin this game since plantara dripped and I have one thing to say this is probably one of the best games I’ve ever played it’s amazing there are so many things to do in the game so many boss to fight and I’ve played it on phone Xbox and now pc and I do not regret buying this game on all three devices it’s an action packed game that requires lots of grinding and I think this game should be 60 dollars it that’s good this game deserves so much more credit than it gets. Literally the best one of my top played games of all timers

While this game isn't for everyone, this is a perfect game for casual gamers to sit down with friends and be creative! Or you can summon cthulhu, either options works!
Terraria is one of the best games I've played.
But not because it does something really well. No, Terraria is an experience.

A little similar to minecraft, you start with nothing..
Well, aside for few basic tools. But you are weak and defenseless. Good thing that all of enemies around you seem to be derpy slimes.
So you collect some wood, build a work bench and you decide you should create a little box around you because night is falling and you're not sure if you're capable of taking on whatever is going to come. This is where game begins.


Terraria perfectly encompasses the feeling of progression. You start weak, and you can work to make yourself stronger. You can craft armor, craft better weapons, find some different weapons, which will trigger some NPC-s to move into your house, and from them you can buy even better weapons and tools. And then you use those better weapons and tools to make or find even better weapons and tools.
And because there will always be enemies that will be able to overpower you, you will never feel as if you're grinding for the sake of grinding.
And game progresses at your own pace, but it will try to stir things up a few times to make sure things don't get stale. And it will usually do this if it thinks you are ready for it.

A game this is commonly compared to is Minecraft, but make no mistake, this is not Minecraft.
This game is so much bigger and more complex than Minecraft. While in minecraft you usually go for stone, then iron then diamond, in Terraria you have so much more different materials. In minecraft you have 5 different kinds of armor and in Terraria you have donzens.
Some of which even provide different playstyles (such as bee armor).
And that brings me to another point.
Terraria doesn't get stale because it has so many different ways to play it.
So many different items that provide different functionalities. You can't have it all, after all there is limited amount of inventory space. So you must commit to one or two ways of playing the game. And you will keep progressing until the literal end of the game. And after that you are free to do what you want.


Game is extremely fun and satisfying.
It has quite a lot of replay value (trust me, I know).
There are many ways to play it.
It also receives plenty of updates still to this day.
And you don't need a powerful computer to run it.

It is definitely worth 10 euro it costs, and even more so when it's on sale!
I wholeheartedly recommend it.
I have over 1800 hours on this game, not including all of the hours I played on my iPad when I first played it, and I don't regret a minute of it. It starts off as a very curious game filled with wonder and imagination as you start climbing your way up the ladder of the world and try not to die. Then, once you finally get to the end, you get to restart and play the expert version which you will undoubtedly die in many more times than you did the normal one. And perhaps after playing for super long you'll know literally everything (like le me) and decide to move on to mods, but this is highly unsuggested until you have played the game a lot, since it just makes things even harder. Anyways, the game is fantastic, get it nOW.

A friend introduced me to Terraria back during version 1.1, and really got me into gaming again. I love all the crafting, building, and treasure hunting possibilities, including adding wires to give objects on/off states. It's frequently updated, including the pixel art. Just good sandbox fun.
the og sandbox. Only annoying thing is there is no creative mode built into the game so if you're trying to build for longer than 15 minutes, have fun with the constant solar eclipses. Thankfully Hero's mod via tmodloader solves that issue. Built in graphics for items are also not as good as starbound but that's ok since you can still make really pretty things using just building blocks. Suggest you google Terraria creations if you are debating buying this game.
I have played Terraria on mobile, console and PC. The game has so much content. I have played on mobile for around 200+ hours with my friends and it never gets old. It has unique and challenging bosses and a huge variety of building blocks. Terraria is 100% worth the money.
Great game!
Terraria is an awesome game for those of you who are looking to sit back, Relax and chill in a very adventurous and casual experience! (◕‿◕✿)
Terraria is a fabulous game to play with friends.  The game seems deceptively simple but has many complex layers and a diverse arsenal of items and materials.  

However, when playing alone it does tend to get a little boring sometimes! Try and play it with friends!
Ive put alot on hours into this game both on pc and xbox and it keeps me coming back. The bosses are awesome and the gear you grind for is rewarding if you like rpg's and adventure games i would highly recommend this game. 10 out of 10
When i downloaded tModLoader Terraria has bagged and i have tModLoader but i uninstalled tModLoader and I MUST play with mods tModLoader 2/10 Terraria 10/10. Terraria and mods are good but tModLoader is bagged.
Sorry for mistakes with words I'm from Poland.
Terraria is simply the best game I have ever played and way better than minecraft. i have no time to explain all the awesome things about terraria, but a suggestion. I know the next update has creative mode, but I want some post moonlord game content. Kind of like calamity mod. Keep up the good work!
WOW i mean sure its good but get a freind,or find one with this game,every playthrough feels diferant in a good way theres so much to do,sure you could grind bosses or such but you can also build machines,decorate houses make a mob farm,overall just AMAZING
Here is a list of some pros and cons of Terraria:
[h1] Pros: [/h1]

-Amazing gameplay;

-Amazing soundtrack;

-Interesting boss battles;

-Lots of achievements;

-Interesting mobs and NPCs;

-Smooth gameplay;

-Plenty of biomes;

-Cheap price,can go down to 3 euro on sales!!

-Lots of items;

-2 difficulties to choose from!

-[u] Mod support!! [/u]

[h1] Cons: [/h1]

-The crafting can be a little overwhelming at first,because of all the options to choose from;

-Some of the NPCs don't do as much as the other ones,and it's kind of annoying when they move in the houses you've build for another NPC;


In all honesty,this game is a masterpiece.What are you still doing here?Dive deep into the world of Terraria and explore it's content!
Played this game plenty of times on plenty of different platforms and still it still feels fresh and exciting to get back in to it like I have just got the game and playing it blindly for the first time.
[h1]The Poor Man's Minecraft[/h1] Or that's at least how one of my friends put it. Perhaps because it only has 2 dimensions rather than 3. This may go some way as to explaining why the game is nearly always priced at $10 and even lower on sale. And believe me, that's high praise, relating this game to something as popular, beloved, well-renowned, and just as well-respected as Minecraft.
But onto the actual mechanics of the game. Just as with many games of the survival genre, you start out with nothing and work your way up to high leveled equipment reminiscent of the early days of WoW. (That's "World of Warcraft" for you young'uns out there.)  All the while you will be collecting items, objects, and materials, fashioning for yourself tools with which you will conquer the hordes of danger to come your way! So yeah, the game is standard fare for many players of survival games. HOWEVER, there are some notable differences that make this game, both, a bastion for warmongers and a creative mainstay for all players alike. The wide array of varying enemies based on environment compounded by the much higher amount of creative biomes give both crowds much more than Minecraft ever did. (Although, that is still a [i]fine[/i] game.) In addition, the more biomes that exist, the more objects that exist in the world, often with their own rules, effects, and tricks to using them. Therefore more possibilities exist. Just as well, there are many events that pop up in the game depending on the time you've spent in the world and what you've done. Oftentimes, during these events, bosses will appear in which you will have to fight and succeed. After which, you can loot for many gains and glory all round! This game, like many in the survival genre is much more fun with friends and with the pretty low price tag, why wouldn't you get this for a friend? They won't be disappointed, I assure you ... and [b]WHY ARE YOU STILL READING THIS, OMG JUST GO GET IT![/b] $10 was all it took to experience this masterpiece of a game and I have friends that easily put 1,000 hours into this game and would gladly put in many more. Obviously there must be something very compelling about the game if one would willingly dedicate that much time to a game that had been overshadowed by a much more successful title.
real quality game

So basically Terraria is a really fun game with a lot of different items, but it's the best with friends. You can build a cool base, and nice houses for NPCs. I find it really fun to build these houses, because it can be an overall goal. There's a lot of bosses to fight as well, I honestly think Terraria is a really fun game that everyone should be able to play! :3
This is absolutely one of the best games I have ever played.

Terraria is a 2d sandbox game that has a more satisfying looting system than Borderlands, and a more diverse and complete crafting system than Minecraft. The game always has just one more quick thing that you want to get done before getting off until you realize you just told yourself the same thing about 4 hours ago. I hate saying this about games, but this one I cannot help it. It is a truly addictive game, and it is one of the best gaming experiences out there in my opinion. I have played through it once every month or two with my crew of friends and even my wife now, and no sign of stopping any time soon. 1000+ hours on this account, and a few hundred on my personal account. 

AWESOME Game, AWESOME Company, AWESOME Community.

Trust me, when you fire this game up, your little fuckin' nuts are gonna start quakin' buddy. Your little nuts are gonna be quakin'. yeEEAAH YEEEAAAAAAAAAAAaaaAAH YEAAAAHHHHHHH You're gonna shoot CUM! YOu'Re g0NNa sH0oT CUM! You're gonna shoot HOT CUM! EVERYWHERE! And that's a promise. That's a promise, folks. That's a fucking promise right there. You're gonna shoot fuckin hot jizz all over your computer, all over your mechanical keyboard and your Razer mouse. I swear to God that you will bust a nut the first time you play
that's my money back guarantee. 
If you don't bust a nut the first time you play, message me.
The only proper way to beat skeletron prime is with a friend mashing a teleporter as you shoot at it. The screaming begins whenever he starts spinning
i would like to report something, in terraria, for some reason my character was deleted somehow, ik what hardcore is and i didn't lose it to dying, this deletion happened overnight, for some reason my character lost all of its progress, and its play button doesn't work, the world that i used it in, is being labeled not as *normal* or *expert* but as **unknown world** can someone please help me, the data is no longer in my files for some reason and i don't know where to turn too, i had literally over 24 hours worth of work into that game.
i will post a good review about this, but that's only because i am at least still able to play it, please fix this, if you can find my character their name is N, and if you can fix this glitch please do, i don't want anyone else to go through this.
i even have screenshots of this for anyone who needs to see them.
This is very, very replayable. There are four classes that you can pick from in the vanilla game (meaning there is also mods that can make the game more interesting and more replayable). Mage, Melee, Ranger, and Summoning. All of the classes are extremely fun to play and bring a different experience to the table. Mage uses mana and ranges from shooting fireballs to shooting rainbows. Melee ranges from swinging a wood sword to swinging a yo-yo which shoots lasers. Ranger which ranges from a normal bow to shooting a gun with a shark on it. And Summoner, which ranges from spawning a slime to fight for you to spawning a dragon. The only problem I have with this game is that the fishing system is very slow, in terms of turning in quests, and the beginning of the game is slow and can be discouraging to new players. Nevertheless, I have played each class and can 100% say that this game is recommended.
Ten Seconds In: Okay, pretty cool. I like the style.
1 hour in: Man, getting all this new gear is great!
Hour 5: Wow, I'm getting some pretty neat stuff.
Hard Mode Starts: Shit, this is pretty challenging.
2 Seconds later: Oh, never mind, I have good stuff again
Now: Okay, it only took me 26 hours and three days of playing the game to get to Golem with a Terra Blade. Lets see how fast I can beat the game.
Moral of The Story: There is no moral, buy the game. I just put all that stuff above to display how my addiction to this game is stronger than a 40 year old divorced veteran to booze. I cannot express how good this game is. Buy it, please. You won't regret it.
I bought the game 5 days ago, i already have 40 hours. This game is WAYY Underrated. This game is so much fun, their is so much to do, and there are hundreds of items that are completely unique (like f$cking bee grenades).
This game is an easy 5/5
Once I actually had some idea of what to do, I started to blast hours a day progressing through the game and it provides great challenge. Also very fun with friends
i adore this game, there's so much to explore and do, there's always room to upgrade and you grind for resources and items to get to where you need to be! Even when you finish all the bosses and get all the rare items you can mod the hell out of this game and have so much more to do! Some mods even make it easier to get the rarer items :D
Honestly one of the best games of all time. I've spent countless hours with my friends and family playing this game over and over again. There is so much to do and so much to challenge yourself with. It's a game that everyone can find enjoyment in!
I do not even know were to begin with this game well i guess first off. The lenght of this is INSANE. To the point were i think its impossible to 100% this game. AND DONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THE MUSIC!. The bosses in this game are INSANELY fun. Not only is this game insanely fun this game has one of the best difficulty curves in video game history. i only suggest you maybe not try expert as it is insanely difficult lol. Anyway this is the best sandbox game on steam no wait EVER!

So overall 999999999999999999999999999999/10 :)
Best $5 I've ever spent. Literally. On anything.

Definitely on my top 3 of all-time, if not #1.

(Note: if you're not used to crafting games, check out a tutorial online. I played this game for an hour or so and then it sat in my library for almost 4 years. When I came back to it, I looked online for the basics and the game just opened up. A masterpiece.)
wonderful game. ITS NOT MINECRAFT!!!!! anyway, it is one of the best sandbox games out there. the horizontal gameplay is awesome. from fighting The Eye Of Cthulhu to the Moon Lord, it is great. the challenges the game give you and the extreme buildings you can make, like Terraria says,"The World Is Your Canvas", which is  very true. i TOTALLY reccomend it. 10/10 5 stars.
I've played over 1,000 hours on this game, and I can say that it's simply amazing.
Most of the time I've played this was probably with friends or brothers, but AT LEAST 100 hours of it would have to be solo, so overall an amazing experience to play, and at only $10! And when this thing goes on sale, OOOOOOHHHH, you're missing out by not buying it for single digits!
So overall, at least 53/10, would do again
One of my favourite games, would highly recommend if you like minecraft but want a game with more story and more things for you to craft, build and kill.
One of the best games i have ever played. This game will always have a special place in my hart because of all the good times i had with my friends and my brothers playing this game :D
If you are thinking about buying this game i highly convince you to buy it. At the start of the game it can get boring and grindy, But before you know it you are slaying bosses left and right. And along the journey you can build so many structures.
Some other people including me say that the building in this game can be more enjoyable than minecraft. I can guarantee that even when you play 2,000+ hours in this game you can still enjoy it. Not from personal experience but i can just tell.

Would pay more 14/10
I have been gaming since the Atari 2600 and have played a strong plurality of all the PC Titles ever created and I can say without a shred of irony, that Terraria is the best game of all time.  By hours played in my life, only original Everquest comes close to it.  It is nearly infinitely replayable because of the procedurally generated worlds and I routinely replay the game once a year or so, especially if there have been patches.  No other game has had me coming back that many times.  The constant content updates for the past 8 years offered new challenges to conquer with each replay.  Thank you Relogic, the work you did here rivals anything ever done in the gaming industry.
Lots of good memories of sitting at home from school and playing with friends early in the morning on a LAN server. Dying to bosses because young me sucked at games. It is a really deep game and has lots of content in it. The community is definitely alive and friendly so go find some people or friends to make a server on. If your all new it is really something special too as you encounter new events (even though it is 2D it can have spooky or jumpscare moments) and find new items. A lot of fun and worth the 10$ it is asking for.
my fav game ever i have played it for 3 years and havent even completed it singleplayer.
there is so much to do i have done like 20% of this game i dont think i will ever get bored of this game 
especially because they keep adding updates. if you want to start playing this game i recommend playing 
it with friends its a lot more fun.
I literally spent 5 weeks straight grinding this game and I still have more to do! I piss in a bottle and poop in my sock(I would have done that anyway) and yet I am still gonna have another 5 weeks to go on it. My pp gets hard when hell starts to get hot and when my brother played with me he literally had to use a de-fib on me because i died midway through. It is the single best game I've ever played and ever will play, THANK YOU
terraria reminds me of a time where i could go and eat a pasta inside of a another man! anyway good game fun just wish there was more to do. but mods are cool so :L
Great game for anyone who likes exploration, linear progression, building, boss slaying, or getting TONS of different items throughout your game play.  Definitely requires some game knowledge if you are looking for a good time.  Even so... 10/10
This game is awesome!!!! You should totally buy this game it's so fun. You can do so many things in this game and its incredible!!!
10/10 would recommend
so in one week i have played 30 hours of Terraria and i have already completed the game in normal mode now time to use another 30 hours to complete expert mode...
When I was young I got Terraria on my phone and even then I thought it was a great game with a lot of great aspects. But little did I know when I got older I would spend hours and hours on Terraria. Keep up the good work!
A game worth spending time on it， especially when cooperate with your firend(s)
Though I thought it was boring at the first sight, it just brings me joy when playing it.

ton of content, especially with mods. get some friends and it just makes the game a million times better. runs well on almost anything as well. its not even 20 bucks, there is no reason for you not to try this out.
i wanted to like this game, but just couldn't. everything felt like a chore. from exploration to combat, especially when it comes to the bullet sponges the game calls bosses - nothing felt satisfying or rewarding. the music's nice though.
Everytime i make a new world and i save and quit and join again it wont start this happend to me like 5 times i spend tons of hours on this game and this happens

i dont recommend this game to anyone unless they fix the bug.
The absolute GARBAGE "tutorial" makes it infuriating in the extreme to figure out how to do anything. Even basic shit like "place a goddamn door" is a fucking chore to figure out. Not handholding is one thing, BUT AT LEAST EXPLAIN THE BASIC CONTROLS YOU FUCKNUGGETS >< Argh I'd refund my time too if I could and would not have bought this piece of frustration years ago...
I bought this game (a 4 pack actually) to share with friends and play. I tried installing it, nothing would work. I tried every steam support recommended fix and even a few forum recommendations. Nothing worked. It just froze on the first time set up screen for hours and hours.... what I did not know was that leaving it on that screen, in hopes that it might figure its crap out..., would actually count towards "gameplay"..... even though I've never played 1 second of this game... apparently I've played it for 13 hours and they won't refund my purchase. Thieves. Taking money the didnt earn..... usually you have to provide a product or service for taking peoples money.... I have not gotten anything accept a "title" in my library that is useless and does nothing for me. I don't want this game and even if they could get it to work for me. I probably wouldn't want to because of how stupid/sucky the refund/support process has been. Would not recommend if you haven't already figured that! :D
I like this game I would play on my console and it would run smoothly, but for some reason ( This may be my laptop as it is not a gaming laptop but is almost brand new) it runs at like ten frames per second. Also, I can't do anything except jump while moving. I recomend this game if you have a good computer or play on Xbox, Playstation, or  eventualy nintendo switch.
