            "I love Artifact so much. But I find it really boring to play with a deck because you have 3 cards and you have to do the best to get all cards you need (it's pretty luck and the weaker one is allowed to go first). I can see the game being fun, the gameplay is nice. There is always \"RNG\" in the game.\n",
            "I dont want to buy in at all until I'm satisfied with it. Its so expensive right now and I've just been really impatient. It's very common for me to find my round three full of RNG, and now I'm finding that really boring and unfun.\n",
            "I hate RNG in card games.\n",
            "Its too bad that there is no free way to win cards. There was a \"free 3 packs\" like deck for free in HS but now i would need to pay 5 bucks for every 7-8 heroes. If a card had to cost $20 to have a \"free\" deck then thats just not possible.\n",
            "If you really want to play the game then get in the game now because there are so many awesome new features in it that you will love it.\n",
            "If you want to buy the starter deck then get in the game now because there are some sweet new cards that you will want to use to make your \"free\" 2-3 wins deck.\n",
            "All in all I would give this game a 3 stars. Its more expensive then HS and even then you would need to pay a few bucks more for the cards to get those decks. But I will probably get better because I know I am, but there are plenty of new cards to add.\n",
            "I have been interested in the games for a few months and i enjoy them as such but i have been stuck with HS for a couple months now. I decided to give the game a shot and i wish i had waited\n",
            "When i first got the game i didn't like it, then i realised i was a while into HS.  When you get to lvl 1 with the 12-card decks you will have no tickets, you also have to pay money to win new packs and tickets (for the 12 cards) or some money to build a new deck (5 tickets). So i bought HS for about 25$ and this game is already the biggest game i own.\n",
            "Im enjoying the game, i got to the point where i need a new set of cards to complete my deck.\n",
            "I hope to see an update soon with all the sweet new features i can play.\n",
            "Best card game i have played and played since the start and for the last two months i have played HS and TCG.\n",
            "Haven't been able to write a review so i decided to give it a try for this.\n",
            "It's pricey to buy into the game because you can buy cards in the market and if you want a good deck you need to spend money on boosters and rarities. But for like the uninitiated: This game doesn't allow you to raise your deck after buying it. You have to win 3 matches in order to get a good deck. I guess it's like Magic : The Gathering . But only with Magic .\n",
            "Next day i gave it another shot and i found out that i have no tickets. And i already stopped playing HS because i didn't want to spend more money on it, and now i love it, now i'm enjoying it because its a card game.\n",
            "The playing of the game feels unfair in the same way that other card games have unfair play, in that i can buy every deck in the market and if i want to be in the top tiers i need to pay extra money. But you can play this game without paying money, you just play the market and enjoy.\n",
            "Here is the thing: If you want to play the game as a single player you are welcome to play it, and if you want to play with a friends you are welcome to play it, i don't see any reason to play it otherwise. If you want to play in a competitive tournament with your friends then no problem, this game is fine. If you want to play in casual then you can do it, but not this game.\n",
            "One last thing: If you want to play with real friends then you don't have to pay money at all. If you want to play with any non-good players then sorry, but your will have to pay money because that's how free this game is.\n",
            "Also, I'm afraid that there are a lot of advantages that a typical TCG (and HS) can have in card games. Hearthstone is literally free. Due to this a lot of people would be happy to just play for free.\n",
            "The thing is that if you want to play it as a single player and you only have $20 to spend, its much cheaper to just play HS.\n",
            "This has to be the most expensive TCG I have played. That said i'm sure this will change because the cards that it has at launch are very cheap, there\n",

            "I love Artifact, and I got my refund for it but I'd advise against paying even to play any digital game. Its a fantastic title, though if you really want to go you can always play tourneys.\n",
            "Artifact  is a fun and complex card game with plenty of depth and play style, with no one having their favoured deck locked behind a pay wall. Most games are less than 30 minutes long, it can take you a while to find your game on the board, I've done some great runs and come up against a classic deck in every game I've played. There is a tutorial and some guides if you want to know how to play the game, but at this point you probably have no clue what you are looking at. That said, if you want to create great competitive decks and challenge yourself, it's worth buying, even if you don't get the card.\n",
            "Now on to the review. This game is so good and so fun, I was excited to start playing the game and it was fun to do so, I've been enjoying it since the first expansion just like you would expect, even going 3 wins in that game (my longest time in any game).\n",
            "In theory I've spent thousands of dollars in digital card games and this is no different. I love this game and I want to buy it so bad and do more to bring it to a broader audience.\n",
            "This is a must buy for a digital card game (especially a card game that is so complex that it literally takes hours to understand). This is a game that you can get anywhere and at reasonable prices.\n",
            "There are a lot of people that are complaining about the \"pay 2 get a free pack\" and \"too many decisions\" and not paying to play, but I know that I can run anything I want. I've even spent $2 on a constructed deck and still have another $2 worth of cards.\n",
            "The most annoying part is how many card choices there are! To me, a choice is a choice, and I don't care about a lot of those, but to someone who wants to break out of certain play styles it's like losing a hand.\n",
            "I've played almost every MOBA on the market for years and I love Artifact! The gameplay is deep and the matchmaking is competitive. You can never expect it to be easy to get past your opponent, but it is a fun game to play! I've also bought an hour worth of Hearthstone and it's really fun, and I already have 100% of my collection now.\n",
            "And if you don't enjoy the matches and don't feel like spending the money on a \"free pack\", you can just play constructed. If you don't like the concept, don't buy it. I highly recommend it.\n",
            "The gameplay itself is deep, there is depth in terms of what is possible. I wish there was more scoring and color combinations so that it didn't have to be so simple.\n",
            "Despite the extremely competitive nature of the game, there are still plenty of casual games to enjoy and challenge yourself.\n",
            "I love it and if you don't like it, it's your money.\n",
            "I could easily spend an extra $10 on the core set. I don't want to, but I'm more than happy to because it's free!\n",
            "And I got pretty invested on the game so now I'm only on the freebie. If I want to spend time with casual drafts and stuff I can. I could probably spend around $5 more on the entire core set, which is amazing.\n",
            "I like the game, but I don't know if I should support it.\n",
            "Artifact is pretty expensive. I have played from the beginning of the game to when I got the game I love. You can just buy it if you want and it's not as hard to play as expected.  It feels good to play because you know you have a good deck, but I feel like paying more might not feel good at all.\n",
            "Now for what's important.  The tournaments are free. You can just play the constructed mode and ignore the reviews and go.\n",
            "This game is way more complex than almost every other card game on the market, it seems.\n",
            "This is one of the most mechanically complex games I've ever played.  The meta is pretty cool.  I really feel like people will get too bored with the fundamentals of the game to feel compelled to learn something new.\n",
            "Artifact is easily one of the most addicting games I've ever played.  I've played most of my time in this mode and still can't put a game down.  They obviously want to make it fun, but it's such a fucking decision.  They have to decide if they want to make it competitive or casual. I strongly recommend the casual matchmaking, but I can imagine people who don't get tired of the progressions playing there may not.\n",
            "I can see this coming into the market, they added 1 day to the EU EULA and I have\n",

            "I love Artifact, it's a wonderful, deep card game. I would have never understood the original uproar against the game. There's a deep, challenging gameplay that's interesting, in-depth and fun. It's not as easy as people say it is to learn, though, there's a lot to do before you get a good feel for the game and also in card drafting. The tutorials are also super great and teach you a lot about the game without you spending a bunch of money on the starter kit (although they do cost money though).\n",
            "I have been playing Hearthstone for over 8 years now, with over 200 hours played and not losing even once. The Legend system is pretty exciting as well, as is the theme system. Even though I spend more money on the base game than most people, I enjoy every game. If I get bored for any reason I will probably switch to Dota 2 and Hearthstone.\n",
            "I do not know the specifics of how they will work, but it's a lot more balanced than Hearthstone and that's a good thing. It's not as flashy and silly as people say, because you don't have to have every card, but the gameplay is more to the point.\n",
            "I have played through 10 hours now, which seems like a lot compared to other reviews I've seen (18-26).\n",
            "I actually like this game, I don't think this is a great card game, but I also didn't want to quit it so fast because I'm not sure what the big deal is. The more I played the more I like, and I definitely will keep playing it.\n",
            "The product is still awesome. The game itself is well worth the money. There's a solid progression system and tons of replayability.\n",
            "I had so much fun with this game! I got the chance to play the free demo with my friends, and had a blast! Also it's pretty cheap compared to other cards games.\n",
            "I played Hearthstone for years now. I think that in those years I got a lot of enjoyment out of the game. So the game is fun, but it's not for everyone.\n",
            "(You'll need to spend $15 on the game in order to play it. If you want to play the game you can try it for free, or spend the money to get more cards if you're a casual player like me)\n",
            "Overall, it's good value, and I really hope the game will continue to grow. I do believe the game will continue to grow if Valve introduces an in-game currency. The very first 50,000 cards will cost you $1.00. It will also take longer to pay for cards and other cards because now people can pay to get their very own cards. There are currently 3 options to pay for a pack (25 cards).\n",
            "There are currently 3 available in game currencies (Gold and a ticket, as of writing) but these can be changed in the future. Currently though, the only currency that has prices is the ticket. This is the best it has been since game launched. It's pretty cheap. You can actually get all 3 of these without spending money.\n",
            "I have just received the game and will report my experience in the next update. You can buy the game without paying a cent. Now i really wish all the negative reviews that people have been posting.\n",
            "A lot of people complained about paying the $20 for the game, that's what you get for that, basically you get 5 boosters and 2 starter decks.  Personally i'd just buy the entire game (300€) for the top 10 cards.  The ones i'm spending more money on right now are RNG mage.\n",
            "I have enjoyed every single game so far. My most played card game in years is Artifact and it's the best card game i've played since WoW and MTG.  Many people have complained about paying to play, well guess what. I payed.  I paid for the \"diamond\" boosters, I paid for the Top 10 starter decks (the ones from the first packs, 3x each). I also played more competitively than Hearthstone and MTG (0.11.5 and 0.42, respectively), which means I'll probably pay more for cards in the future.\n",
            "Overall, the free game is really the best case scenario. I can buy or sell the top cards and still have a good time. I've had more fun than playing Hearthstone and MTG, and I've been spending way more money on them than I should have.\n",
            "I have enjoyed playing Hearthstone for about a year now. I was able to draft with any card that I wanted for almost half a dollar and it's still fun and fun to play. However, this game is a massive step up from MTG. If I wasn't being prepared to put upwards of a couple of hours of effort into Hearthstone, I wouldn't have bothered. I would have played the very same game that I've played in years.\n",

I would say a $20 price point for Artifact is a bit high, but you do not need to pay for a full set, you can get most of the basic cards at that price.\n",
            "The game plays very well, and there is a lot of depth. You can purchase cards to create constructed decks, build your own competitive decks, and that is not a chore. Constructed is a $20 game, while those competitive decks are actually pretty fun to play. If you are looking for an epic card game and the pricing model is something you like, you might be better off spending the $20. It is still super fun, I have just bought all the cards I need (including the one I want to get for $5).\n",

I know I'll get a lot of support and feedback, and I hope this won't impact my overall opinion, but I feel like this is the best card game I have ever played.

            "-- \"Historical card game\" is the biggest mis-conception I've come across. Sure, its not totally true that \"Total experience gained\" is \"experience\" based. The game itself is pure and simple MMG. The card sets may vary and even have absolutely different feel, but in general a card set is based on the \"preconstructed\" decks you get from expansions and boosters. You can earn packs (really) by playing this game. But those packs are way way better than any other game in the world. Or in other words, you can grind for weeks for your pack. Then when you sell it, you receive less than a single ticket or almost nothing.\n",
            "If you want to go infinite in this game and win, then you need to play for multiple winning streaks and make sure you pick a deck you like. You need to play a lot of casual matches because even the best (1st) decks get destroyed on the first go. Also, you need to have played every good deck in the game and every bad deck in it. And you need to keep your good decks playing.\n",
            "I would not recommend this game if you don't have money. You need to get as much money as you want. And this game has a very low playerbase. If you are playing for fun, then you shouldn't buy this. If you are seriously trying to win the top 1-2 prizes in your region, then this game is not for you.\n",
            "After the game got released, they released with the update that they nerfed your monsters and caused all your good cards to drop. In other games you would get lucky and get your entire collection from them. In Artifact you have to have some of the \"fair\" games (ie some decks you can play for free). So the game is not perfect, but they fixed some bad things.\n",
            "Artifact is a great game and I've only played a couple hours and I'm still enjoying it. After just playing there's no shortage of strategy in it. I hope they keep fixing it and there'll be no need for me to buy tickets.\n",

            "This is not the type of game I played for years so i will refrain from reviewing it. There is not an entry fee to the game, it's $15 USD, and there's 2 active realms. I can also get some cash in here, it's expensive to enter and of course there are no bonus prizes. I have played a lot of card games (whole deck) so expect a lot of spending money in there.\n",
            "Yes there is free meta decks but it's expected to be paid for in the future, so you have to prepare.\n",
            "So, i dont want to talk about the monetization issue because i really do not want to waste my time. Honestly, i should put it down, as i don't see what the big deal is.\n",
            "I love playing this game, if the budget was not so high people wouldnt buy it, now there are better cards which are less expensive, so it would be a lot cheaper if the game was open.\n",

            "[ad] Almost all cardgames are pay to win.\n",
            "[ad] Costs 1 ticket to enter non draft games.\n",
            "[ad] You can't lose without spending money on the main board, the same as in MTG.\n",
            "[ad]  Only pays for the games which require a ticket.\n",
            ". No other card game has this kind of value in the market, and i don't think the game is pay to win.\n",
            ". It's not like every other card game, where you pay 1 ticket to enter and the rest you have to buy the tickets.\n",
            ".  Almost all cards have an effect, and in this game you dont need them.\n",
            ". In MTG it would cost you about 70 USD to get a constructed deck, but in this game you have enough cards to win a constructed without paying any extra.\n",
            ". See what i mean here ?\n",
            "There are no free play in the first place, which is annoying.\n",
            "( Very good game design. Save your money. It's a very good game for sure).\n",
            "It would have been so much easier if Valve got rid of all the money. Also, to be able to play the free draft without paying a dime would be cool.\n",
            "[b]Oh, and it's fun to play free draft mode for free, too.\n",
            "[b]Now if you only want to play constructed, then play free draft mode, but you'll need at least one ticket for that, unless you're desperate. I would say buy the game to play for free, but then i would've stuck with that. If you want to play for draft, then you're going to pay more money than a lot of people here. [/b]\n",
            "No one in here complains about how much people pay to play the game. The mechanics in this game are simple, and it's fun. That's it. Don't care about the monetization for me, or most of the players, or how many tickets the game has. Get yourself some friends, start playing free draft and enjoy. The gameplay is pretty amazing, and you have to pay for everything else because everyone who plays the game wins, but if you play free draft you can win more tickets by playing for free. But be aware that a lot of people have zero money in their pocket atm.\n",
            "But let's talk about the pay model, you could play the game without paying anything. You could spend your money on the non-season ticket, or whatever, it costs much less than a MTG tournament ticket, and it's a better game. Or you could use this as a pickle with the system and play forever, and then if you lose you just refund the ticket and continue on. I like this game.\n",
