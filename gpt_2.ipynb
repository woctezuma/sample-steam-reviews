You can play constructed for free, or you can play phantom draft (single player), or you can spend money on tickets and cards just the game. To keep costs down, you just need a wallet/card library. You can play infinite draft or phantom drafts as well (with only one loss) and with no packs, tickets or rares like with the Steam Market currently, you can pick and choose what you want from free and/or pre-constructed decks.\n",

This makes the constructed mode so many times more fun, and I feel like it's a much fairer game now because in this mode you need to be smart about what you play, and knowing how much you will need depends heavily on your deck.\n",

The most expensive card is RNG, 20 gold gives you Axe, what cards can you obtain around 20 gold? You dont even have 1 hero? If you play this game you wont get what you pay for, and it costs 3$ to play competitive,  and it costs 10$ to finish 1 competitive deck. I'd much rather play dota 2 instead of this game. The economy would be much worse since you cannot trade cards. Would be nice for us to have the marketplace instead of just trading cards with bots. You can sell cards on a marketplace but it would take a lot of money to do it. Valve has stated they're working on it but right now they need time to make it work, so I'd like to see them doing something. Or do they?

I'm enjoying playing with my deck that I won't play against people who don't have cards with specific cards that I have to play around or it's terrible.

There are loads of cards that are just unplayable in constructed or are expensive in draft and if you feel the gameplay feels off, you are not being honest.

If you are a TCG fan that has actually played a lot of TCGs you will quickly realize that it is completely different. The core gameplay is a lot of different and interesting tactics and mechanics.

            ". money is required and it all comes down to the skill level of the player. The game is not that complex to start, but learning modes requiring you to buy cards will make you more cost effective than the more affordable open/free/open beta card games.\n",
            "Game is super fun and complex (with a ton of mechanics and potential for depth), but I find myself wanting more, not more, but that's not really a criticism of the only mode that really matters, casual phantom draft, which lets you start and build a deck of your own. The game is missing some of the best content in the game, I would have paid $20 for this game at launch, but you get to keep the cards if you don't want to spend more, which, while I don't mind paying up, is actually a bit harsh on some people. I think there is still room to play with a LOT of different deck builds, so having the ability to add in free phantom drafts is huge for me. Other than that, if Valve really make some changes to add some sort of progression or rank system for certain people, I might give it a medium rating.\n",
            "I cannot recommend the game yet. However, I do hope they add in some more ways to earn cards via daily/weekly quests and some sort of in-game currency. This is a game I will miss a lot longer-term and I'm not sure I'd rather have a month of Hearthstone or Magic on my hands.\n",
            "Don't buy this game. There are a lot of potential strategies you can experiment with and the game is really just a glorification of tedious algebra.\n",
            "Not worth the money, I feel.\n",
            "Pay to pay to win, you are rewarded with nothing more than the worst cards in any expansion until you pull off the coup de grace. It just feels so empty.\n",
            "No ladder, the only way to get cards is to play through the pay to win system. I feel like  the progression system was a mistake but they failed to mention the impact it would have on the bottom line.\n",
            "Game too RNG based, and I don't know if it will change with some form of progression or just the stale meta.\n",
            "I love the 3 lane setup and the strategy and cards is what makes my game viable. The RNG will always be there like in MtG, but it takes a while for the RNG to become a detriment. But I don't know if it will change in the future.\n",
            "I wish there was a reward for free play, but the $20 for the game was just a way to insert it into the gameplay package. Of course there is no way to get in-game currency without paying real money.\n",
            "Just don't buy it. Even if it is true that the 20$ for hearthstone progression offers a lot, this game is still a cash grab.\n",
            "No ladder, no progression, just pay to win.\n",
            "This is a fun game, definitely worth the price + the $20 to get into it instead of going into Hearthstone, Gwent OR Shadowverse. Just don't waste your time with paid games. The market values of cards are pretty shitty right now compared to what other card games could have brought in the first place, so I'd recommend checking back in soon, though!\n",
            "The business model works ok, in that it can make or break you if you aren't careful with your purchase. Also, don't expect tons of free content without planning ahead. They do offer a free draft mode, so this is definitely a good game.\n",
            "If you're worried about having to pay more than the original $20, feel free to check it out. If you didn't get the game before that, don't worry, now you can do unlimited free drafts and constructed (only 2 losses to start, yeah!). If you want more cards, you have to buy them (luck is on your side as well) or buy packs and sell them on the market (luck makes cards worth buying). As a casual gamer, I'd recommend going back to something like HS. The economic model is very, very acceptable for what it is nowadays despite any concerns you may already have (minus a few bad reviews now). If you're looking for some kind of free alternative to Hearthstone, go for it, seriously. You can also do infinite free drafts, which is a very nice feature (even if you don't want to spend more than the initial 20$).\n",
            "So many gripes that are not even remotely related to the business model. Don't listen to the trolls, Artifact is worth every penny. It's not a P2P game in the sense that the pay to win structure is not ideal, but is still a highly enjoyable card game.\n",
            "My main card game problem is the endless repetitiveness. Every match I've had more than one victory after being outplayed. I can see how I can improve and adapt more to the game, but how can it be done? Valve have changed their mind on this;\n",

The only big downside to this game that I really have not touched on in a last update is the fact that you cannot grind for cards, you can buy them in the marketplace, and you can play the Free Phantom Draft matches.

The only problem is I'm not interested in playing that much anymore (besides Hearthstone where I started) and the progression seems a bit too steep. That's not to say I'm not interested, it's just not possible to become a daily player with the casual and the draft modes combined. I'm very interested in playing the expert modes and doing constructed, if that's your thing I'd probably consider it.\n",

I will update as I play more and play more until I get lucky with the boosters in the first few turns.\n",
            "It is a good card game, with interesting mechanics. I like the fact that you can buy the cards you want. People are complaining about having to pay for the game, but if you think about it, the best way to play is in a competitive online game where there is a chance to win. It is not worth buying cards/packs with Artifact just to play the game.\n",
            "If you like draft, this game is really good. It's not trying to be P2W like other card games, but trying to be P2W like other card games. I really like that it's not f2p like other card games, but like a P2W.\n",
            "The economic model is actually good. You can get cards from the market for free, and the price is not that steep. You can buy the cards you want with real money, and the best cards are about $0.05, and a small amount of rare cards are $1.50.\n",
            "People are complaining about the price, but it's not as bad as other card games, a few bucks isn't too much, and you can get most of the heroes for a few cents. The only bad thing about this game is that you don't get to keep the cards you draft, and the fact that you have to buy packs to play, is a bit annoying. I really do like the game though, I like drafting more.\n",
            "I think the monetization model is really good. It's not that expensive, just a bit cheaper than other card games. It also allows you to get your collection of cards straight.\n",
            "People complaining about the monetization model are probably too young or poor to be able to grow their collection, it's more than worth it in my opinion.\n",
            "Do not buy this game unless you are willing to spend money on top of the game to get a full collection.\n",

            "The economy seems to be very good for people that want to play constructed or for people that want to play keeper draft. But for people who want to play for fun this game just isn't for them.\n",
            "I have been playing card games since my highschool days, mostly magic and yugioh. I'm mainly into the TCG space but I've also played a little bit of both board and strategy games in general.\n",
            "For the price of the game, you get 10 packs of cards containing at least 1 rare. You can get packs of cards for about $15. If you don't want to spend too much money, you can just buy the cards you need directly instead of grinding.\n",

It's the deepest and most rewarding card game out there. Maybe it's because I grew up playing them but I literally just hopped on the train at night to play this damn good one.\n",
            "I've played a lot of TCGs and it's actually super fun. The mechanics are really interesting and the gameplay is fun. Don't understand the hate for this game? If you're not one of the 50% of the population then you might have a tough time getting the game on PC. If you are then this could be a great game for you.\n",

I am a computer player, I achieved a lot with computer games. I love the game. I played it a lot. I don't like it. Why? It's not fun. I'm not going to argue. The game is very simple, but I have spent a good amount of money on it, so it's not fun at all.\n",

            "I am mostly okay with the lack of progression, but the lack of card rewards hurts the game a bit.\n",
            "The game is not actually that much fun if you have $20 to invest into it.\n",
            "I really hope they add more features in the future.\n",
            "The game is very fun and engaging, and the amount of free modes makes it very fun. I think they could have made this better if they made the free modes more generous. It's much harder to grind free modes if you are paying for it, you will always have to buy packs to get good cards. With the free modes, I think it's worth it.\n",
            "I wasn't going to buy this game, but now I do. I've played a lot of TCGs, and this one feels like it. It's a very unique turn based game. It has a lot of depth and different phases, it's not just a single player game, but a turn based TCG. The last few rounds are incredibly interesting and interesting, it's like playing three different versions of the same deck, but with a set of subrouties. There are a LOT of ways to play this game. I'm not going to just focus on the pros, but the cons.\n",
            "First of all, the game is really good. It has a lot of depth. You need to think about what your opponent did and want to think about what you can do instead of just blindly following what your opponent did. You can do a lot of good in this game. You can kill an OP hero and you can kill your opponent's hero. It's not the worst of the cards, but it feels different. You have certain things that you can do that make it more interesting.\n",
            "The other aspect of the game is the card draw. It's random. You've seen it all and probably should read it. It's not that bad but it feels bad. It's not great. There are cards that let you choose which lane to go to play cards that let you choose which position you need to play your cards. It's not that bad in this game, but it's a little weird. It doesn't feel good either. It doesn't feel good for me either. It's pretty hard to say anything about it except it's just a little weird.\n",
            "Anyway, it's a great game, the draft mode is really fun and I think the card pool is really good. I think that the games are really really close, I think it's really close.\n",
            "The main problem I have is that it isn't Valve. They don't make games, they make sound games. They don't make games, they make sound games. I think that they are trying to make the best possible blend of strategy, fun, and fun without trying to make the best possible blend of strategy, fun, and fun.\n",
            "And that is why I think this game is really really good. It is very much like a real world TCG.\n",
            "So, what are you waiting for? Pay your way to the top. Don't listen to the people that are writing negative reviews expecting to get the full fun of the game and thus get to experience it in a physical form.\n",
            "Not sure why people are writing this review.\n",
            "This is a game that I'm sure many other people are saying, (it's unique and unique in the TCG space as well as the digital space), I really don't know what I'm talking about.\n",
            "The gameplay is the most fun I've had with any digital card game (not just the paper ones, but also the digital ones too). The amount of strategy involved is enormous but if you just put aside the fact that it's digital and you're just playing (to build your own deck, or build a friend to play with), this is a really fun game to play.\n",
            "If you like the idea of having a board game, this is for you. It's not like the other games in the genre that are just one board and have a lot of health, the other games are multiple board you can play around vs others, the reason for this being that you can split up resources and play cards, this is what makes this game fun.\n",
            "The amount of decision making involved is just insane. Every single time you make a decision you have a lot of time to think it through as much\n",

It's not as complex as other card games, but it is more complicated than those that use a similar learning curve.  You can spend a lot of time learning about the cards and lanes, and in some games even the heros and items.  For me, I think Artifact is a much better game to play for when I just want to chill and have a quick game.\n",

            "I've been playing the casual phantom draft, and I've been having a blast. The marketplace makes it really easy to buy the cards you need for constructed, and it's actually cheaper than other digital card games to just play the draft. It's a lot of fun, and if you're willing to pay, you can play the casual phantom draft all day, and draft all day with no rewards. The other cool benefit of the game is that you don't have to constantly be grinding to get cards, you can just buy the cards you need for the constructed decks you want.\n",
            "I like the game a lot, I think it's a lot more complex then games like hearthstone and other free to play options.\n",
            "I dont really like the business model, like you need to buy cards to make the decks you want, but in order to actually use the cards, you have to buy them. Thats not a bad thing, it makes the game more fun, and also allowing you to purchase the cards you need for the decks you want. I think they are doing a good job, and maybe this will make the game die a slow death already.\n",
            "I dont really like the way the game is monetized, you can buy only a portion of it for $20. Thats why i dont like the monetization, also you can only use the tickets you get for leveling up, but keep in mind now you wont get any rewards unless you win at least 3 games in the first 3 tickets.\n",
            "The game is very fun, very deep. Matches are very close, sometimes its just a matter of predicting what will happen if the opponent gets a good starting hand. The only negative is the lack of free way to play, but it is fun.\n",
            "I like that the devs have a way to give cards to players without paying for them, instead of forcing you to buy packs to get the cards, and that the cards will end up being fair value.\n",

Its a great game, very polished, and i think that's a good thing.  The fact that there is a free draft mode, and free constructed and free tournaments is a good thing.  The fact that you can sell the cards is not a bad thing, i think that it simply serves the community better so that people who would otherwise not spend money on the game can just buy the cards and play.\n",

I really hope they change the entry fee to enter the game.\n",

I played for a while but when they release a new game every 6 months the cost of a meta deck will probably not be that high. The only good thing is the 10 packs i recieved for playing the game so far.\n",

            "Great game.  While the monetization is a (mostly) minor complaint, it does not detract from the game.  The gameplay is solid and the game is very easy to pick up.\n",
            "I feel like with the current state of the game it is just not worth the money.  If you like TCGs I'd say stick with Hearthstone for it is a bit more complicated and takes a bit longer to play compared to most other TCG's.\n",

I understand it feels bad to not get cards for free in the first place, but maybe they don't want to have to spend a lot of money in the future to have cards that are going to make it in the deckbuilding app to play constructed. I understand that they're trying to make the game fun, but I don't understand why this feels so bad to not get cards for free and that's a good thing.\n",

The game is very affordable at the moment, but actually you can play a ton of draft for free if you really want. I'd recommend it to anyone who's interested in the game and wants a game that's enjoyable.\n",
            "This game is not pay to win, its not f2p, its not as complicated as everyone says it is. You can play draft for free if you really want, and you can buy a complete deck for under $10.\n",
            "Great game with a very high skill cap.\n",
            "I enjoy the game. I played a lot of dota and the competitive scene and I really enjoy the genre.\n",
            "Easy to learn but very fun. The ruleset is nice and the complexity actually makes it fun.\n",
            "I think people are just not used to playing card games like this. It is intimidating to even begin, the maze elements are fun. It is also 20$ so if you want to play constructed you will have to pay a bit. If you want to play more you will have to pay.\n",
            "Great game. The mechanics are solid.\n",
            "I really like the game. The three lanes make the game a lot more interactive and allows you to really think about what you are doing and do something. The matches are a lot of fun.\n",
            "I'm having a lot of fun with this game, it's very engaging. I've played a few games so far and I've won a lot of games.  I think the core mechanics are good and the game is super unique.\n",
            "I like the game a lot and I think it's a good game, I would definitely recommend this for any fan of card games.\n",
            "I'm not entirely sure why anyone is complaining about the monetization model. I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about the cost to play, but I don't see any reason to believe people are complaining about the price at all. I think people are just too harsh on the community.\n",
            "The initial $20 buy-in gets you a ton of content to play with varying difficulty levels.\n",
            "Constructed gets you a decent amount of cards and a selection of other games with different competitive modes.\n",
            "Currently I'm writing this review because I'm curious to see if the game is worth it's market value.\n",
            "I'm a huge TCG fan from the early days of Magic and I think Artifact is worth the $20. If you're okay with a casual draft format then you can build a decent deck pretty cheap.\n",
            "The mechanics of this game really did a disservice to the people who expected it to be a good game. The flow of the game and the randomness of the three lanes really made it hard for me to win.\n",
            "The draft modes are a little bit more frustrating, they also give you no way to really know if you lost because of the randomness or if it just randomly came up.\n",
            "The core gameplay is good, it is just not that fun for a lot of different reasons. Sure it is not the most complex card game out there but at least its not complicated. There is a lot of variation and it is fun to play around with different game types.\n",
            "If you're like me you probably like playing cards because you have to think about what you are buying into. You can buy the specific cards you want from the community market and if you are lucky enough you can get them from the packs that the player is buying in. The player that is buying this game with the most money will probably get more than the player that is not. If the player that is buying this game with the most money then the game will probably be much more expensive for the person that is not a rich guy.\n",
            "I've been playing the phantom draft modes for the last few weeks and it has been really fun. I've made a few decks but most of them are $20 and I\n",
