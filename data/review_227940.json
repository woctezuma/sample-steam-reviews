{"reviews": {"48983077": {"recommendationid": "48983077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072968815", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 11819, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550134525}, "language": "english", "review": "Heroes and Generals, the free-to-play experience.\n\nWhen you start off the game as a new player, specifically infantry, it is damn near impossible to get into a game where everyone is at a \"equal\" match rank. You start off with a Gewehr, Grant, or SVT (depends on faction) that takes 3 hits to kill anyone, that's not factoring in the dollar store hit detection. And in a more experienced lobby,  it becomes near impossible to really enjoy the game due to everyone else possessing fully auto fire arms or sniper rifles, and gunning you down in the seconds of getting seen in close quarters, or getting shot from seemingly nowhere in an empty field. Now, as a free to play player, it takes nearly twice as long or even more to grind out some of the better weapons as you really lack any firepower to compete against any other weapons with the starting rifles, with that, you can't really make any money because you end up spending most of the round running to a point and dying.\n\nGameplay:\nDon't listen to anyone when they say that weapons are based on skill or that you need better aim to do well. This games damage numbers are like drawing from a lottery, random inconsistent numbers, never seemingly enough to net you a kill. LMG's are literally a joke (Johnson), they are capable of engaging at any range and out trading nearly any weapon with little to no modifications, and the only way to really deal with this is with fully modded gear that ends up costing more than you earn. Tanks in this game against infantry, think about it like a shooting range, where you are the targets, incapable fighting back as you'll be lucky if those Panzersfausts you find on the field even net you xp when you hit the tanks. Playing as a new player in these types of matches really test ones patience as you get smited by HE's every moment that you're alive. Instead of a match where you're looking for players to pvp with, you'll spend most of the round respawning while getting camped by a higher tier tank. Reminder, these are all things that you'd have to face as a starting player, when you have no real impact on a game regardless of what you do, and you would have to continue to experience this every single game until you've sunk enough hours and money to become relevant in a match. Normally you would be playing in an encounter to get experienced to the game, but that doesn't quite work because of how the match making works, it only takes one player with a high level weapon to completely turn the match into a firing range.\n\nTeam play:\nEveryone has bad games, that's true for everyone, but maybe a slight bit more often than one would like in this game. More often than not your teammates end up being more of an obstacle to you than the enemy team is, you can go into a gold tier match but get matched up with players that are just beginning the game or are still in the suffering grind to be able to play the game. Your performance, no matter how well you may play, can cause you a defeat anyways.\n\nConclusion:\nDon't pick up the game unless you have a tremendous amount of time to waste or if you're in the process of trying to lose your mind. The grind is not worth the grind, the gameplay is not fun or intuitive in any way. If suffering sounds like fun to you, then go give this game a try. Otherwise, there are much better choices out there.\n", "timestamp_created": 1550132500, "timestamp_updated": 1550132500, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 54, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.710653066635131836", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49220068": {"recommendationid": "49220068", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123489269", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 469, "last_played": 1551453428}, "language": "english", "review": "Was an awesome game until they decided it was a good idea to push spawns a mile from the captured objective, plus its just world of tanks at this point", "timestamp_created": 1551046463, "timestamp_updated": 1551046463, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.567987442016601563", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Hello Soldier,\n\nThank you for playing Heroes & Generals.

And because I was a F2P player, my options were pretty limited. When I picked up this game, the initial feeling was that it was awesome, and that it will become to next game I play a lot. Then as I played further, that initial sensation wore off, and I became face to face with the many issues this game has.\n\n1. Getting to the frontline\nWhen you die in this game, you respawn, often very far from the action. You have a few options. One, hope that a teammate also died recently and spawned with a car. Two, have bought a vehicle yourself (which costs quite a bit) and do that. Three, hope that there was a random bicycle or truck by the spawn point. Or four, just take 2-3 minutes walking and running to the front.\n\n2. Economy\nWhen it comes to games that you need to grind, this is one of the biggest examples of it. For a casual player like me, I get around 5,000 credits (or whatever the currency is called) a game, maybe 6-7,000 on a particularly good game. Even though Reto gives you free vouchers on holidays, it doesn't really help too much with the fact that you won't be making too much more money. Considering the fact that there are also repair costs, you won't be making much money per game and will have to grind a lot with a Membership to get anywhere.\n\n3. The New Player Experience\nBecause I have experience in shooters, starting out with this game was easier than it would be for other people. For one, iron sights on the standard semi-auto rifles are pretty small and thin, and even on high graphic settings, is still hard to see as it blends in with everything you're aiming at. Also, bullets don't go exactly where you aim them so newer players will have a hard time hitting anything. Even when you unlock SMG's, the experience isn't too much better as Veteran players will just kill you over and over. Along with all the other things listed above, this is not a noob-friendly game.\n\nSo in conclusion, this is not a game that is really worth your time, and you'd be better off picking up a game for a few bucks rather than play this pile of junk.", "timestamp_created": 1550198592, "timestamp_updated": 1550198592, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58125537633895874", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48793029": {"recommendationid": "48793029", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970326289", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13, "last_played": 1551081271}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried playing this game again after years away because it's a great concept with amazing game mechanics and has the *potential* to be a great game...except the developer decided to turn it into a pay2win scam.

Why force someone to grind harder when its already hard enough.....TRASH.\n\nCLASSES:\nThere is the Infantry, your standard soldier....costs 9000 credits, the only fair price in the whole game for a class if you ask me.\n\nPARATROOPER:\n Literally the same as goddamn Infantry, it has the same weapons the same gadgets the same everything, the only difference is that he can jump out of planes to land on objectives, but he has limited inventory which means you can only bring a gun, nothing else...no gadgets, no sidearm no nothing, the only thing you get is ONE EXCLUSIVE weapon for the class.\nAnd if there is no available plane for you to spawn, YOU SPAWN ON THE GROUND LIKE A REGULAR INFANTRY, or you jump out and right before you could land an enemy soldier shoots you down.....or an AA gun does the same, or your plane gets destroyed by an AA gun, it doesn't matter its just sh*t trust me.\nEven a regular infantry can get back into action with its vehicles, it has way bigger inventory for gadgets and weapons, and i repeat it has the SAME GODDAMN WEAPONS.\nOh and did i mention this sh*t costs 71k credits?\n\nRECON CLASS\nOnce again the recon has the same WEAPONS AS INFANTRY.....a goddamn Karabiner rifle with a scope.\nThe infantry has the same Karabiner rifle, and you can attach a scope to that aswell.\nThe only difference Recon has that his scopes are more magnified, you can add more mods than the infantry, it has ONE exclusive vehicle you never going to use.\nYou are never going to use that \"more\" magnified scope unless you plan to camp in a bush whole match, and infantry have scopes too on the same weapon, and the modding on the Recon's rifle is not that different from the Infantry at all, its almost non-existent, and dont get me started on that \"class-exclusive vehicle\", just dont bother its sh*t....the infantry has a wider choice of vehicles than Recon. And while the Recon can only use Sniper and a pistol as sidearm, the Infantry can have the same weapons as Recon, including pistol and rifle, plus he has smg's, assault rifle's, lmg's, gadgets etc.\nAnd still the Recon costs 208k credits, wow.\n\nTHE TANKER:\nFinally a class that is unique for once and not copy paste sh*t, with its vehicles and gadgets for the tanks such as a wrench for (REPAIRING AGAIN LMAO) but this time its in-game repairing not the credit type......oh not so fast, the wrench deterioates too so you have to repair that aswell with credits, A LOT OF CREDITS.\nOh dont worry this shit class have flaws too, first of all lets say you grinded 120k credits because thats how mutch the class costs.\nThen you go into a match only to realise your FIRST EVER TANK that came with the class has NO CANNONS, which means you only have shi**y machine guns, you cannot damage enemy tanks at all with that, you can only shoot infantry.\nAnd here comes the best part, if you want to unlock other tanks, you have to get xp for a ribbon that unlocks other tanks and level it up, but you only get xp for that ribbon by damaging other tanks WHICH IS IMPOSSIBLE.\nSo all you can do is shoot other tanks with your machine gun and get xp for the ribbon that way, but you are not going to deal damage to them at all because an mg is useless against a tank's armor, all you do is farm xp, then they blow you up every time, then you respawn, and so on. You are basically defenseless until you farm enough xp and unlock a new tank.\nAnd no, you cannot kill infantry with a tank and gain xp that way, you only get xp to that ribbon by shooting armor, thats the only way to unlock new tanks......f*ck logic.\nTalking about tanks, i bought the Tanker from the German faction and i can guarantee the tank balance in this game is f*cking pathetic between factions.\nIt didn't matter which tank i unlock, which one i buy or go with, everytime i met a more expensive tank from another faction or just a more expensive tank in general, i lost the fight all the time, even when i was the one suprising them.....even after a volley of shots they slowly turn around and f*ck you up like you tickled them, if you have cheaper tank from the same category as theirs or from another category, YOU LOSE.\nThe most expensive tank is the most OP in every situation no skill involved, the tanks dont counter each other from different categories, nothing like that, money wins.\nAnd dont get me started on the prices either. 400k-300k-200k each IF you want a good tank that can barely fight with the expensive ones, if you want cheap go for the 60k or 150k ones, but dont expect to win at all.\n\nThe only class i didn't play with is the Pilot, but if you did not notice already, im guessing its the same as every other class, overpriced class with overpriced vehicles, and no fun and fair playing with starter gear.\n\nI unlocked the General the last \"something\" i cant really call a class......guess how mutch it costs.\n2 MILLION CREDITS, no thanks.\nFrom the videos i saw about this class the only thing you can do is send troops on a map, buy troops with warfunds (which is another currency) and thats it.....its an RTS game where you watch your ordered troops which are highlighted as pathetic squares on the map moving to territory from territory, you can resupply your fighting troops on the war map and THATS IT....THATS IT FOR 2MILLION CREDITS.....THAAAAATS IT\n\nUNBALANCE BETWEEN FACTIONS, FACTION WEAPONS, VEHICLES ETC...:\nEverything the vehicles, the weapons, United States Faction has the most OP tanks next to the pathetic list of weak tanks in the German Faction, even the Russian tanks are more powerful.\nThe weapons between factions, one faction got the trash ones while one has the most OP ones\nThe whole thing is just a mess and it really all comes down to who has the more OP gear.\nThere are no counters, weak points, differences in who's better in what NOTHING.\nSomeone has the sh*t, someone has the good, thats it.\n\nJust go play the game, lvl up your profile to the War game mode, and you'll see what i mean.\nThe germans are nonstop losing because how OP the Americans and Russians are. Better gear, better weapons, better vehicles, better everything.\n\nIf one faction starts to pound another into the ground nonstop in a gamemode that literally revolves around the whole game, is there really any balance in the game? I dont think so, War mode is literally the definition of \"unbalanced\" if you dont have enough recources on your faction because the player generals are not willing to send in any, and their general did, you lose. So you basically lose and you have to accept it, because you cant do anything about it....", "timestamp_created": 1549412666, "timestamp_updated": 1549413391, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.526714742183685303", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49063237": {"recommendationid": "49063237", "author": {"steamid": "76561198158181193", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 11858, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544739435}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is oK, but the grind is absolute trash.

The pilots are the worst offenders of this. Also I play as the Americans because patriotism, and by god do they need buffs. I looked at stats comparing the guns from germany and america and holy crap, the fact I was able to win any gunfights astounds me. The tank crewmen are hit the worst because america has tanks that are great against russian, but will bounce off medium german tanks. Also the map deign is terrible and lends to spawn camping.

However there are just so many problems it really turns onto the page of having to pay me to play this game. There aren't many bugs but that problem is smashed out of the park when compared to the amount of broken balancing and horrid map design.\n\n Lets get the balancing out of the way, originally the Germans had the most OP guns until they nerfed them all into oblivion. However only did minor tweaks to Russian and US guns, giving the Russians the most OP gun of them all and has been in the running for years, the AVS. The Americans don't have that much of OP weaponry however their weapons smash the German's compared to how cheap their good weapons are. such as the grease gun being just as powerful as the MP40, which is triple the times of the cost. Now out of weaponry, the vehicles are really unbalanced where is gave the Russians a car that is more like a tank, The US and Russians a motorbike that is more like Sonic on Cocaine, and the US tanks that have enough health as a Dark Souls Boss and has the power to split the earth in two. Some of the German tanks are balanced and the others are as scary as marshmellows because of their damage being close to a BB-Gun. \n\nNow onto the map designs, O-baby are they bad. Honestly, the hit-boxes for some items on the map are as big as your mother. Along with the placement of doors being a joke and always one sided, mostly you can tell if the Attackers or Defenders are going to win just by the map alone. Some areas are as cluttered as your room and the rest of the map is a barren wasteland were you wonder if the Minutemen are going to ask for your help. All of these maps are a sniper's wet dream, so much so that they doubled the cost of being a sniper compared to being a fucking tank commander!   \nNot to mention every map is not vehicle friendly, the placement of everything makes it really hard not to go offroad, due to every road leading to a checkpoint that is blocked off by hedgehogs and sandbags. Also if you drive offroad your speed gets so slow that the enemy could run up to you and bonk you on the head with a shovel. So the use of tanks are pretty much just snipers with a 50BMG and having the size of once again your mother.\n\nI do like this game and will continue to play it but I will never recommend it until all weaponry and vehicles are balanced and the maps are fixed so they don't look like they were designed by a blind autistic kid that can't walk.", "timestamp_created": 1550380674, "timestamp_updated": 1550380674, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49203694": {"recommendationid": "49203694", "author": {"steamid": "76561197983007401", "num_games_owned": 21, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 91, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 91, "last_played": 1550989311}, "language": "english", "review": "Have to admit did not play this game very long as it could not find a battle  - so have deleted it.

So if you die, you get spawn camped over and over again and you proceed to lose the match.\n\nThis is also not mentioning the fact due to Reto:Moto's inept development of the game, the majority of the Community in the North America Time Zone/Servers have quit, so if you are a NA player you are likely to get stuck into a match of EU or South American Ping, at 100~200. \n\nYou are also met with a massive time in which in order to not be killed instantly against enemy snipers who have a fully modded one hit kill gun and a 8x scope, you need to grind for about 10hrs of match time just walking. That isn't a over exaggeration, players tend to only get their Heavy Set Gold (A buff that you can select to reduce damage taken, to prevent you from being one shot) by walking for hours in match time in order to grind the level needed to reach said perk. This also assumes you survive walking from spawn to the objective, in which majority of the maps have large open grounds for snipers, tanks and planes to shoot and kill you.\n\nThere are many other grievences against this game I could list, but in short this game is a poor attempt to waste your time, your money and your life due to the inept actions of the developers at large to develop a game with the community in hand, rather, releasing cosmetic skins to vehicles and guns, and adding large price tag vehicles and level changes to make you spend either hours of gameplay to grind and maintain, or actual currency to buy.\n\nThis game, and the company who developed it is a scam. And as a Vet from the beginning, its a sham of what it could have been.

Imo this is needed and I don't know why I need to request something like this nowadays, it should be a go to right way.\n\nPhysics are nice, but they need a lot of fine tuning to make it work in this game which also goes for weapon upgrades/ enhancements.

It's fun to jump into huge battles and either camp on hills with a sniper or rush capture points with an infantry soldier. It does take quite a while to get some decent weapons but once you've got something you like it's easy to get first on the leader board. My advice is focus on one thing only that you want at the start, because it'll be hard to grind for lots of things at the start. It takes too much time but once you've got a couple of soldiers and with good gear, you're basically good to go on whatever you want to do in the game. It'll be much much easier to grind credits with decent gear, you don't even need to have amazing weapons, just have some smg with high rpm and you're going to get lots of credits per game. But if being just a man with a gun isn't enough for you, you can get in a tank and take on the enemy from long ranges with high explosive rounds or get into fights with other tankers. And if being on the ground ins't enough for you, jump into a plane and bombard the enemy with a birds eye view. There is so much to do in H&G and so many different ways to do it.

NO! It just so happened that I had purchased a very lengthy \"Veteren membership\" package that cost a fair amount of money before being banned.

I have patiently waited for 4 years for it to improve and  for issues to be fixed but it has got progressively worse. The main issue is the pay to win free to play model.  It totally sucks. After playing for 2488 hours over about 5 years or more I got sick of having to use in game earnings on anti tank ammo and ammo for my guns.   As a example of this ...you see two enemy tanks ..but you decide to not destroy them and go to cap point instead simply as you dont want to have to pay for the expensive ammo to destroy them.  This totally spoils the game as it puts you off using grenades that are expensive...makes you deliberately not take some kills as you think of costs involved.  Yes at higher ranks which i was you can earn enough to break even but still it spoils feel of game as you always thinking about costs involved before you kill a enemy.  \nGraphics - these are old now and not very good.  The engine is dated and as they use there own engine I believe it really is showing its age now.\nMaps - you quickly get sick of the same maps especially the ones where you are limited to say 3 ways to cross a river where enemy can just camp the other side and you cant get across which is no fun at all. They have never fixed this and seem happy to frustrate players as they spend the whole game tring and dying to get across a river which is both boring and frustrating.  Yes I am experienced enough to know how to sneak across and flank etc but this puts off new players and many who dont have infinite patience to keep trying to sneak across. With a good few squads often no enemy can get across if I camp which is boring for both sides.\nPay to win - the model for this game is totally broken...making you pay for ammo and to repair vehicles and weapons after a match is a joke as it totally spoils the game as you hold back on firing or using ammo etc or vehicles due to cost this is very apparent in the generals mode where often you wont want to use your own troops for many battles as loss will cost you lots of in game money /currency / war funds. \nMy advice is ....if your going to grind for hundreds of hours to get things that are actually worth something to you then do overtime in real life for real money instead and use the extra cash to get a top end gaming pc and spen 30 pounds on a tripple A title that is worth playing where when you fire a gun you dont have to think about how much each bullet is costing you or the fact that you may have to repair parts of the gun at end of match.  \n", "timestamp_created": 1544884577, "timestamp_updated": 1544884577, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 433, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.923826336860656738", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28792417": {"recommendationid": "28792417", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120760802", "num_games_owned": 29, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 76953, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486671095}, "language": "english", "review": "\"They were too busy focusing on whether they could, that they forgot to think whether they should.\"\n\nOh, this game has gone downhill so fast, so much that playing it now is painful.\n\nWhat they hell happened to \"Help us make the game you want to play\", developers?\n\nEver since Devyatayev update around 6-7 months ago (the infamous Squad 2.0 update), this game has gone further and further down the drain, whilst you constantly tell us that it's \"Working as intended\", which is a blatant lie based on the general consensus of the playerbase, well, what's left of us. \n\nI think \"Working as  intended\" should become your new tagline.\n\nTo give any potential user some basic background information, they first locked changing between squads, so if you were, for example in an Infantry Squad, you couldn't either switch to another Infantry Squad or a Squad of a different class (Tanker, Pilot, Recon or Paratrooper). \n\nThe addition of the Auxiliary seats makes no difference, mostly because you have to grind to unlock them, and they are set by the Squad leader, who could be a level 0 soldier (when you have a level 17 soldier a few xp off becoming a general). To make matters worse, the game then became full of paranoid players who wouldn't use said seats for fear the Squad Leader would kick them from the Squad (and this does happen).\n\nYou also locked weapons in combat, and removed captured weapons from the store. Locking weapons in combat was a fair move as it was a bug that people could, for example, swap their SMG on one soldier for a sniper rifle if needed, but you gave us no option to move weapons between characters, which you have been promising for a while now.\n\nThen came Evenhart, where you added a load of unwanted 'Immersion changes', which just means it takes 1.7 years to get out of your tank (making anti-tank infantry even easier to play as), and give you motion sickness when zooming from first to third person view.\n\nThen came Furness, where you 'Balanced' the tanks (it's not even close to balanced), and then added the 'Player Journey' add-on, which made changing classes for newer soldiers impossible, so you are now forced to buy them.\n\nThen came Garmen, which revamped all the maps (instead of just the capture zones), making each map essentially the same (mostly forest with some urban combat at the centre), and mae it so you spawn in the middle of the woods with no vehicles.\n\nThen came Hallowes, which closed off windows on houses (making roofs essentially unreachable camping spots for paratroopers), decreased the base salary and nerfed the M1/M2 carbine and MG42 into the ground, instead of to in-line with the other weapons.\n\nThen came Ihlefeld, which introduced a massively reworked piloting system that makes flying the old planes nigh-on impossible, and getting a good score (hence a profit) pretty much impossible. Also came a load of undocumented price increases - 541k for a Level 0 Recon is insanity.\n\nSure, the latest update is decent, but all it really does is add in even more expensive things for players to grind in. If you hadn't introduced all the flaws in the game, I would be singing high praise for it - indeed I used to.\n\n\nIt's so sad to reminisce about how the game used to be even just a year ago, when you truly cared about your playerbase and promised us future updates (new factions, bipods, more vehicles and weapons and maps and so on), but now we can plainly see you only care about making a profit.", "timestamp_created": 1483022519, "timestamp_updated": 1486066956, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 376, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.916218459606170654", "comment_count": 81, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47981623": {"recommendationid": "47981623", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112240060", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 687, "last_played": 1551677527}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1] (please Vote helpfull if you like or agree with some points so we can help our game to get better )\t[/h1]\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------- \n[b]This game was really fun before but those developers don`t care about the game they only care about milking around 2k players and that horrible because they are going to kill there game while the game can be fixed and boost its player base by 70% atleast through some easy changes :\t[/b]\n\n1- Make grind easier at least for low tiers so they dont hit a wall and leave the game before they try or enjoy it \n; credits grind is not much bad but rank /ribbons system sucks \n\n2-Soldiers should run more then 5 secs make it 20 secs atleast \n\n3-Anti tank is really expensive and useless ; light tank need 2 mines or 4 H3 - meduim 3 mines  - heavy = more  and thats a total joke specially when AT options are expensive !!!\n\n4-Scopes are very blurry  and narrow, why ???\n\n5-Add at least 2 civilian trucks for skirmish or decrease spawn time and make atleast 1 truck around every capture point in large battles\n\n6-Remove bikes or make them usefull  (atleast make it like before ) \n\n7-Make a field for testing weapons with option to customize weapon mods so players can be familier with there weapons and try whats good with em \n\n8-Remove medic resupply boxes and make it back from ammo crates or increase medic resupply points \n\n9-Respawn unvisibility is very wierd and looks bad with grey color just make a nice icon over spawners so every one know they are spawning and cannot be killed unless they start firing", "timestamp_created": 1546248320, "timestamp_updated": 1546521369, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 306, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90210270881652832", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Hello Soldier,\n\nThank you for playing Heroes & Generals and writing us an insightful review with suggestions.

I can no longer recommend this game as it went worse and worse for the past year and a half. I no longer have fun playing H&G and question the decisions Reto.Moto took during that time span.\nHeroes & Generals is a F2P WW2 game with a vast variety of weapons, vehicles, camouflages, planes and tanks. This is most likely the best WW2 game you can get in its category. However I have a few things to address before you start getting into the game.\n\n[h1]This game is not meant for casuals.[/h1]\nAs a new player, you will find yourself thrown in a massive pit of doom as soon as you hit Gold MM (after 10-15h of playtime from my own experience) because everyone is rocking better weapons and better badges than you.\n\n[h1]My opinion on veterans[/h1]\nThis game is based on a F2P formula, so of course there will be veterans/ premium players. If you are skilled enough and have decent game awareness you'll do just fine. So I consider that not being a real issue (it will be hard but it's possible).\n\n[h1]My opinion on the matchmaking system[/h1]\nThis is by far the biggest problem with this game, some people will say it's the grind but to me it's who you are MM'd with and agaisnt. And it goes both ways: New players struggle against experimented veterans and veterans struggle with new players as they have little to no game sense/ game knowledge due to the lack of in-game tutorials. Sure you can watch videos but there was a time where you could train on a map of your own (the First Blood map). Such map was removed 2 updates ago and can now only be triggered once per account (if they didn't change it this update).\n\nI didn't quite realize it myself since I've been playing Heroes & Generals for around 2 years. I recently decided to start a new account, not understanding the complains of some people. To me it was just fine, I made my credits, I got a lot of kills and influenced games a lot since I pushed myself to cap (since most of the new players will tend to grind for weapons, ribbons, badges, etc. and camp). \n\nThen I started the new account, I was doing just fine for the 2 first ranks, I even found it more enjoyable to play as everyone had the same loadouts, to me it felt balanced. [u][b]BUT THEN I REACHED GOLD MM[/b][/u]. Alright it wasn't that bad because I know this game (people tend to over exaggerate), but it was still harder than I expected and I can only emphasize what new players are going through.\n\nIn my opinion, leveling up from Bronze to Gold should take twice the time it takes now. New players get thrown in too soon against veteran players. People will tell me: \"Git gud\" or \"Learn to play\" or even \"The salt on that one is real\", but there is a thin line between not being skilled enough and not being geared enough. I'm expecting to reach Gold MM when I maxed out at least one loadout (starter weapons for example).\n \n[h1]My opinion on the Grind[/h1]\nWhat did you expect, it's a free to play game. I've never really complained about this part of the game so I have little knowledge about what's going on. All I can tell is that prices for some items are really weird/ not logical. But I guess it's the way Reto wants to go in order to limit the appearance of such items in the game (ex: people running with MG42, M1/M2, AVS on Bronze MM). The only thing I could recommend is to increase salaries back to the previous build in order to be more new player friendly. \n\n[h1]My opinion on Reto.Moto[/h1]\nI don't want to lynch the devs for everything that is wrong with this game. It's a small company, they do what they can to provide us fun content. It can take them very long to push an update with little content and it saddens me to see people discrediting Reto for any little issue this game has. \n\nBut, sometimes I feel like Reto and the community aren't on the same page. \n\nFor example, the new plane update was nothing like I expected, what everyone expected. We were expecting, for example, p51 for the US, Bf110 for the Germans, Pe-3 for the SU. But instead we got recon planes which have no influence on a battle. They literally just shoot each others and that's it. Even if really fun to play, they can't bring anything else on a battle because of how weak (armor and firepower) they actually are.\n\nAnother example, they made it impossible to get on roofs now. I remember seeing myself on B2 on Forward Airfield trying to shoot down paratroopers camping on the roofs (because you can cap points on roofs which is stupid now that they removed the ability to counter it). And dont get me started about attic capping.\n\nThere are many other things like that and sometimes I wonder if Reto even fully test its game before pushing an update.\n\nMoreover, Reto ninja nerfs features they don't mention in patch notes. Last time it was the credits earned per battle (which has now been explained unofficially), the window example explained above, etc.\n\nOn the bright side, Reto is making a lot of progress in order to address these issues (prototype server, gathering community feedback, etc.) and I can see them improve overtime.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\nAs I said, this game wasn't made for casuals. Don't play this game in order to achieve or unlock things but play it for what it was meant to be, [u][b]FOR FUN[/b][/u]. And if you can overcome the first hours of grind, this is actually quite a decent WW2 game. Maybe even the best in its category. You can play with many different weapons, drive jeeps, halftracks and trucks, pilot tanks and planes, parachute behind enemy lines, etc. And the maps are huge. Sure it might be not so well optimized but I don't hear a lot of complains from people playing this game on a decent computer.\n\nThe least you can do is give Heroes & Generals a try, it's free and who knows, you might like it.\n\n\n[i]PS: Sorry for the long review, I have no idea how to attach an image of a potato so you'll have to deal with it![/i]", "timestamp_created": 1482074000, "timestamp_updated": 1482075467, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 283, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911693096160888672", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24642582": {"recommendationid": "24642582", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008933883", "num_games_owned": 304, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5055, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1461577489}, "language": "english", "review": "The game has gone WAAAY downhill and the devs treat everyone like sh!t 0/10 don't play unless you're making a bad games/poor devs video", "timestamp_created": 1470004460, "timestamp_updated": 1470004460, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.718628764152526855", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "24714787": {"recommendationid": "24714787", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110161673", "num_games_owned": 62, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 12234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1524326580}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as I like this game and how fun it can be, it has so many problems and setbacks that overcome any sense of fun that you might have.

I played off and on for around a year, and eventually gave in and dropped 20$ in it for a Tanker, and less than 3 days later I was permabanned without notice for said name. \nEven though I practically didn't even wanna play anymore, they decided to give me my 20$ back, but I had to start a new account with no badges and no progress whatsoever. Keep in mind even though with 100 hours into this game I pretty much didn't even have any progress into my old account anyways. \n To add to this, they're asking players to waste their lives and money into a Beta game with countless bugs and graphical errors. (jumping out of a car and you go through the world, tanks flipping off wood fence posts, panzerfausts not killing you at pointblank range) Some of the bugs can be funny, but are a serious problem when it comes to you spending money on the game.\n The game has it's ultimately fun moments, but are usually buzzkilled by bad balancing, ridiculous trolls, or camping players trying to farm xp rather than capture a point or help their teammates. \n When it comes to graphics, it has an incredibly washed out pallete of colors, and an ugly haze that's usually so thick you can't see farther than 150 meters, and sometimes less than 50 meters. Aiming is a struggle at first, but you catch onto it when you correct your FOV and mouse sensitivity, but hit registers commonly fail.\n They fixed how bad it was to grind for certain things, that being said it's easier to play. \nThis game used to be a really good one, but now we're just left with a money grabbing  machine that only works if you feed it your life or your wallet.

I remember specificly there being Tutorials for Infantry, it was just a small part of the map and you could choose different weapons from the game, there were AI enemys that were pretty fun to go against, It tought you the basic movement and gun controls, you would also get a certain amount of credits for completing it.. It wasnt much but it was much much more than they have today. They dont have any tutorials of any kind at all. Meaning you have first time players going up against Veterans who have been playing for years. Well if you could get into a game that is.\n\nYou start off with only one game mode availiable; just infrantry vs infantry on a small map, it would be fun if you could get into a game but since this game mode is very very unpopular as the other modes are the main part of the game (Infrantry, Air, Armor) leaving all the new players to wait 5-30 minutes to find 1 single match.\n\nThe first time i started this game; i remember getting the purchasable car within a few matches. Would you like a car now? Well get yourself ready for some heavy duty grinding as it would take hours to rank up your stupid driving ribbon so you can even unlock the car, but you need some credits to buy it. Put even more hours into grinding the obsured amount of credits you need for that car. When i first started playing you would get 10-40 thousand credits depending on how good you were every match, Probably even more. But now you only get 500-8k credits every match depending on how good you are.\n\nThe developers have some weird decisions in what they should focus on, they added helmet camos which have no impact to anything? When the game is so unbalanced with the US side having the better weapons, better armor, and the best plane in the game? With Soviets and Germans being week compared to the US. Unfair map layouts for attackers and defenders, The ridicoulous grind and the overly week tanks that get stomped on by other tanks of the same tier and 1 single Infrantry riding their bike up to you to place mines which blow up within 3 seconds of placing, leaving no time for the tankmen to react.\n\nThe added fact that every weapon, weapon modification, Vehicle, Tank, Plane costs credits every time you use them, you even pay for every bullet you shoot. Oh and they aint cheep; fully wearing out your tank can cost tens of thousands of credits to repair.\n\nI am disapointed with how this game has been treated the past years and so are other people who have played for the same time or even longer than i have.\n\nStay away, Don't support these developers until, if they ever do, change their ways.", "timestamp_created": 1518346153, "timestamp_updated": 1518359769, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 175, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867417335510253906", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43131653": {"recommendationid": "43131653", "author": {"steamid": "76561198263307293", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 34240, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550517023}, "language": "english", "review": "[Dsiclaimer: I used to love this game and I spent \u00a390 because I thought I was supporting good developers, still do not regret these purchases but i wouldn't do it again, especially in the game's current state]  \n\n\nHonestly, its a goddamn terrible game but fun as hell once you get going w/ friends. \n\nI have played since the frst year of early access.

I've spent countless hours hunting tanks for guns that are bigger than I am, flying co-op with a pal and shooting planes out of the sky, Shooting planes out of the sky with a 6 foot long bullet accelerator (PTRD), and going on HUGE Killstreaks deep in enemy territory, but this is ths last straw... I've stuck with this game through the best and worst time, and there have been many. i have so many fond memeries of the \"good old days\" where guns were fun, AND fair. I could see the guns in the menu and i felt that drive to unlock them all. and i did eventually, but as the games age increases, so do the prices of guns and vehicles, pushing this game farther and father away from Free To Play. the updates are getting less interesting and less frequent. In the most recent update on October 1, 2018 they tried to solve the aparent problem with uninteresting tanks, they atempted to mimic the armor modles in war thunder, to make it more interesting. but with the tanks more \"tanky-er\" the chances of an infantry being able to kill them in 0 to none. it went from a 2-3 RPG kill to a 5+ RPG kill, and because your computer is having to calculate all the armor equations, your FRAME RATE DROPS. i used to get around 200-230 FPS, now im barely scratching 120 FPS. In the update, they also tried to make the vehicle physics more realistic by adding different terrains that effect the speed and handling of the vehicles. Now this sounds great on paper, but NONE of the maps were designed for this. im constantly stuck in mud or my tank can't make it up a hill that it used to be able to climb easily. because the infantry cars now have to sick to the roads to get anywhere in decent time, the tanks know exactly where they will be coming from.  every update  seems to just keep adding to the pile of balance and prefomance, and FUN issues that the game has had since the alpha. the more i play this game the more the charm wears off. im no longer blinded by the \"Good Old Days\" of Relentless fun and variety. And all i see now is the STG, and the MP40 spam. tanks that kill right out of spawn. an obvious German bias, and the final dash of salt in my WW2 wound, the lack of respect shown to Veteran players who know the game better than the devs themselves. all they do i cater to the players with 5 hours that complain because they died to a sniper that they didnt see, and they ignore the players who call them out on HUGE game breaking issues because they are too hard to fix. To summ everything up, I will no longer be an advocate for H&G, ill never recomend it to anyone. the buisness practices that they are starting will continue to lead this game further away from the Heroes and general that i fell in love with. im Officially done with H&G, after 4 years and 1800 hours. im done....

We believe we have hit the sweet spot as it is now. It is approachable for casuals, cores and everyone in between. You also state that we are straying away from being free to play.\nWe actively, based upon our design philosophy and player feedback, avoid paywalls and makes sure you do not win just by buying gold. We put heavy emphasis on player skill > gold. Although we feel the system in place right now is going the right way, we are of course taking feedback and might change course down the road.\n\nTanks not being able to be easily, but still able to be, soloed by one player is one of our goals, one of the things we wanted to achieve with this update. Now infantry's role is to incapacitate the tanks, whether this is destroying the tracks, the turret ring or wearing down their armor, it is our intention to make tanks go for other tanks while supporting infantry on the battlefield. We may very well tweak numbers for damage as we receive more feedback.\n\nSince most of our game is server side you are not experiencing any performance issues with the calculations of the damage towards tanks. It is possible you have an old driver or another external issue which causes the FPS drops. We have received some reports of specific people having issues with performance and we are currently tackling those issues.\n\nMaps and terrain is not set in stone, they are always subject to change depending on feedback, heatmaps and possible issues. Voicing your concern is important because this game is being developed in conjunction with the playerbase. If we are contempt with the game but nobody wants to play it, then we basically wasted work. We are always trying to create a game for everybody.\n\nIf it is only specific tanks you are having issue with climbing hills I recommend writing me a comment with the tanks, we would be very appreciative to receive feedback on this as tanks should obviously be able to climb hills, within a certain limit of course.\n\nOnce again, thank you for playing Heroes & Generals and thank you for taking your time  writing this review.

Nothing else.[/i]\nNow I'll provide the cons and a brief explanation.\n\nCon:\n- The grind. Dear lord, the grind.\n- Terrible gunplay.\n- Little variety.\n- Devs, while active, don't care for criticism, and therefore little is done for issues.\n\n----\n[b]Why?[/b]\nWell, I'll start with the positive:\nThis game is presented remarkably. The promise of multiple classes, exciting gameplay and [b]teamwork[/b] are toted as selling points. This shows in game; although just for laughs.\n\nThe 'class'(role) system in place for the game is nicely done. Playing something other than basic infantry gives you a sense of actually contributing, although that's deceiving and certainly not the case; as I'll soon expand on.\n\nWhile looking good, the gameplay isn't anything fantastic. Actually getting into the game and playing for a few minutes will show this. All effects from the trailers/presentations are not in game, sans [i]maybe[/i] dirt spray. It's been gutted, and few things promised have been delivered. Whether this is due to engine limits or false promises is not known, and we'll never receive an answer from Reto.\n\n[i]Well, what about teamwork?[/i]\nUnless you're playing over voice with multiple mates, don't bother searching for it.\nI've only had one incident in game where someone even responded to text that I had tossed up.\n\n\n-\n[b]So, you just started playing: What now?[/b]\nNothing. Good luck getting into a game.\nIf you [b]somehow[/b] get into a game with a new account, you'll be shoehorned into the same map for many a games until you get tossed up a few levels... In which you'll immediately get slaughtered by players who have either spent money on the game, or just those that have had enough patience to grind.\nGoing up against those with fully automatic weapons or one hit kill weapons with a really dingy semi-auto rifle is no fun.\nNor is fighting a neverending onslaught of aircraft continually bombing your spawn, or a tank sitting just outside of AT reach; again, shooting into your spawn with no obvious counter.\n\n\n[b]Well, the gunplay looks nice...[/b]\n[b]BZZZZZZZ[/b]\nNo.\nGo ahead and give the game a try, and you'll see why I hate to even expand on this.\nNo matter what you're using, every weapon of the same class feels the exact same. \n\nGarand, SVT and G43? Same thing, just seperate textures. They all feel like you're throwing stones at a tank, in which you may as well be doing against a higher level player.\nAutomatics? Same case, just slightly more money put into it.\n\nExplosives? \nCan't even bother using them.\nWith how credits(non-premium currency) is handled in game, you'll be draining your account when using these.\nAP mines are useless, and cost more than you'll get from kills.\nGrenades are only good for spam and TKs, which you'll see if you play. A lot.\n\nOther? \nMelee works. That's about it. Nothing special.\n\n\nBesides the above complaints, the actual gameplay just feels god awful.\nPossibly due to my case of extreme CTS, but I can't for the life of me figure out why this is.\n\n[b]Roles must make up for the aforementioned negatives then, no?[/b]\nNo, they don't.\nI'll break down the classes as best I can, although I'm sure to miss something; regardless of a positive or negative.\n-\n[i]Infantry[/i]\nOther than recon, the only class you'll want to be playing.\n\nYou get a gun. You get your standard issue boots. You cap.\nRepeat.\nMaybe break the game with a bug or two. \nDie.\nRepeat once more.\n\nWhile you get access to all the 'fun' stuff, it really doesn't add up to much.\n[i]Unless you AT rambo.[/i]\n-\n[i]Paratrooper[/i]\nOh, you somehow got enough credits to pay for a new class? \nNice. Too bad you'll likely give up on it.\n\nInfantry with less equipment to use. That's it.\nOh, and an air spawn on almost any location.\nAgain, that's it. Nothing else to it.\n\nYou used to be able to control where the aircraft that ferried you went, but no longer is that the case.\nToo much fun to be had, or bugs. Either is as sad.\n-\n[i]Recon[/i]\nYou get a one hit kill weapon(After a grind out the rear, or paying from your wallet), and the ability to spawn an AFV.\nOf course, the AFV is the only thing you'll be using it for; unless you're a tree fairy.\nOther than the skin and somewhat out of place role, there's nothing else to this class other than paying for it. Glorified infantry.\n\n-\n[i]Tanker[/i]\nOther than infantry, the only real and reliable way to make credits.\n\nDrive to a point with your starting machine-gun armed tank.\nShoot infantry.\nRepeat until you gain enough points for a real tank.\nBuy said real tank.\nGet AT Rambo'd repeatedly by everyone and their 'nan.\nWonder why the devs haven't balanced tank gameplay, or given them a proper role other than AT fodder.\n\nYou're basically a giant moving pillbox with a \"[b]KILL ME[/b]\" sign strapped to the side and rear.\nThe maps don't even accommodate for these vehicles, and a majority of them can't even be used.\n[i]Looking at you, TDs. :( [/i]\n\n\n-\n[i]Pilot[/i]\nOh, you've bought this? \nk\nI pray you saved up enough to get anything other than the 'recon' planes, otherwise you're in for a remarkably terrible grind.\n\nAerial combat is a joke. Those without HE rounds to instantly KO the other pilot will suffer terrible pains.\nBesides dying, you can't do a single thing once someone gets onto your tail.\nTeammates? Nice joke.\n\nBombing - you'll probably enjoy this the most out of aircraft; assuming you don't pass out from 'exciting' gamelpay.\nIt's simply nothing more than fly towards dots on the ground, press space, and fly away. Repeat as needed until you cause the entire enemy team to leave due to spawn bombing.\nOh, and there's no counter to you... besides [i]maybe[/i] that one AA emplacement at the rear of the map that can't even aim at you.\n\n\n\n\n[i][b]JED[/b], surely the RTS side and generals must be good![/i]\nOh? You grinded/paid out the rear for this amazingly stylish dude?\nHave fun with mobile-like wait times as you drag dots around the map.\nAs well, I hope you like having [i]your[/i] units used and wasted by players who occupy them.\n[i]Looking at you, para-pilots.[/i]\n\n\n\n\n[b]B-b-b-but... Reto?[/b]\nWhile they put on the facade of caring about their community, they actually couldn't care less.\nComplaints, suggestions and requests fall on deaf ears, Reto seemingly ignoring everything tossed towards their direction.\nFor years people have complained about not only the grind, but the following:\n\n- Vehicle gameplay, specifically tanks and the problem of AT rambos.\n- Credit related costs, and the blatant advantage that one gets for using their wallet.\n- The distinct lack of balance involving [i]certain[/i] weapons and items in game.\n- Costs for customization. Seriously. Weeks of grinding for the ability to paint your guy pea-soup green.\n- Spawncamping.\n- Little to no new maps in the last few years.\n- Stagnated development.\n\nWhat has been done? Little to nothing.\nBesides Reto looking as if they're slowly getting better and on the right trek, nothing has improved.\n\n\n\n[b]In short:[/b]\nDon't.\nI can't suggest anyone try this mobile-like game, and if you do, do so with caution.\nDon't spend a single cent on this until they improve.\n\n\n[h1]EDIT:[/h1]\n\n(Edit of an edit?

Everything is grindable, the levels, the credits, the guns, the explosives, the ribbons, the vehicles, the badges, the attachments, the assault teams, even your knife (which you don't get in any capacity until 5 levels of a ribbon). It's the bad kind of grinding and forces you to play with awful gear for 50 hours before you get the really meta loadouts. Even significant experience at FPS skills will get you so far if you're using a NERF gun against a laser gun\n- The Strategy Game is unplayable until 50 hours of grinding... or for a one time fee of 50 DOLLARS (or local equivalent plus tax and handling). It's blatant what they are going for, and even if you decide to grind your way here, the AT deploy queues mean you literally have one shot at playing Generalisimo before it's game over for literal days. And for that matter, you'll have to wait days to deploy your ATs if you're not in for the first hour of the war\n- The Action Game has been left equally broken, you have to sprint hundred of meters but all your characters have severe asthma and will explode if you sprint more than 10 meters, meaning his iron sights will fly everywhere. The spawn points are fixed and sometimes have no cover between them and the objective, meaning sniper and tank galore. Sometimes enemy spawn points are DIRECTLY in the way to the objective. The physics engine randomly breaks and will sometimes instantly kill you if you gently bump into something with a vehicle, or send your car to do a sick 180\u00b0 wheelie when you tried to gently steer right\n- There are still horribly powerful equipments that break the entire game, and which are -thoughfully- locked behind walls of grinding... or a small fee of etc. M1/M2 Carbine is basically a modern assault rifle out of nowhere, Chaffee and Hellcat outperform all other tanks due to speed beating armor (bad game mechanics there), the Soviets get a Tank Destroyer disguised as an APC and the PTRD which can one-shot vehicles and infantry which makes it more of a .50 cal rifle than anything, all factions have access to OHK Rifles that ruin the balance and allow you to bodyshot kill soldiers from across the map, LMGs can be hipfire spammed when standing and moving, etc. Will never be addressed, because of all the kids who max their credit card to buy the big bad toys.\n- Most of the higher mechanics are horribly unpolished. Backcapping is a valid strategy because caps capture so fast that a single soldier on a motorbike can lock 8 players going for the next point, and no-one defends because you are PUNISHED for it. Literally spamming a car at every spawn is a perfectly valid tactic, and even preferable because \"clown cars\" are prime targets for tanks sniping across the map and OHK snipers taking potshots at the targets, etc.\n- Tanking and Flying are both unrefined. Tankers will quickly find a deathly hate for the so called \"AT Rambos\", and literally every soldier has an AT nade in its pockets, meaning tanks are relegated to sniping from across the map with HE shells, and of course anti tank. APCR makes armor useless, meaning the King Tiger and the small light tanks with a tiny cannon are about as viable in a direct confrontation. Flying is fine, but clearly they've never doublechecked the XP since I get insane amounts of it for doing nothing useful, and there's still blatant unbalances (German plane gets one bomb, the others get two. No idea why, you go ask them because the Junker is certainly not a beast with MGs OR airborne handling). As for the idea of bombers, close air support, fighter split ? You'd wish.\n- A lot of promises and excellent suggestions went literally nowhere over two years. I remember seeing mortar loading slides in the earliest stages of the pre-Steam Beta, those don't exist. Artillery doesn't exist in any capacity either. AA trucks exist apparently, not that you'll see them often. Suggestions for Medic and AT classes to split up the omnipotent Infantry went nowhere. The \"factory AT production\" got turned into a global and awfully scaled AT production queue. And you are still stuck in 20 v 20 when most maps have four flanks open (only two in Staged because closing a flank nukes all your ATs on that front) which could easily fit a humongous 64 v 64. New maps like special capital maps, naval landing maps, coast maps, more town variations (took them two years to fix the 10-ish maps they had). Oh, and yeah, the promise of \"battleships\" they just threw out at the recent dev stream. As if that's gonna happen, a whole naval game out of the blue when we can't even get close to finishing the land or air one\n\nThe concept is sound, the execution is not. These two years of open beta have been a rollercoaster of bad and good, but now it's just a clusterf**k that is only playable if you are lucky enough to be matched with the right players who don't abuse literally every tactic at their disposal, against 10 Recons that sit across the map instantly killing you unless you're driving in a car (and even then, I've trained to shoot out drivers as a Recon), against 10 Paratroopers that will cap the point behind you and drive you out of the map before you can even sprint your way back.\n\nThe development team is incredibly silent and does not appear particularly stressed to adress the foul peasants who are writing long, argumented, researched posts detailing the flaws in the game, instead focusing on adding more overpowered equipment to make people buy it for real cash. Zero communication from the dev team, if the game was broken to the point where people fell out the map every time they spawned we'd be surprised to even see a tweet from them.\n\nI cannot see this game being playable for another year, and that is they fix every item on this list, and don't just wall themselves in silence and pretend nothing bad is occuring.\n\nEdit : Since this has received a surprising amount of attention, I went around and clarified a few points, also I have to say it clearly. The sticking point why I don't recommend this game isn't just \"gun X or gun Y is overpowered\", but the fact even getting a single clarification or promise from the devs on what they plan to do hinges on the miracle. A quick scan of their own official forums shows devs literally never answer to threads as far as the eye can see, despite the low post traffic that makes it perfectly manageable.\n\nEdit 2 : If you've not been annoyed by AT Deploy Queues because you're not even close to that stage yet, then the queues to GET TO PLAY THE GAME should do the trick, wherever logging in or the insane lobby delays (didn't talk about the matchmaker, but it's not great). I can't even tell what the idea behind this nonsense is. Servers overloaded ? Put more online. You've gotten money from your store for the better of two years, and now you have tons of new players which -might- consider it too, if ever they can play.

I usually don't write reviews, unless the game is really really good, or I really get extremely frustrated by something.\n\nHEADSHOTS: One of the main reason I won't play this much anymore. The developer obviously thinks that noobs   (money cows) will stay longer if they get a decent amount of lucky headshots when spraying their weapons. 7 out of 10 deaths for me are now instant headshots. And no, not while I'm standing still. Often the barrel of the weapon is not even pointed at me. I for myself make almost no headshots and most good players also don't, because it's stupid to go for headshot against good players if you have some skill - it's much safer to go for torso. So obvioulsy there is a huge bias towards noobs just to make them happy. But it spoils the game completely for me, because your skill doesn't matter in these situations at all, it's just free trophies for noobs. it's REALLY frustrating. And I am sure the game stats are faked regarding this, how can I die 7 out of 10 times through headshot but the statistic tells me there are only a handful of headshots in the match? Or maybe you get headshotted more often the better you are(?) So think about if you really want to get good in this game, because the day will come that all of these insane amounts of grinding for new weapons and credits will turn out to have been just to realize you get headshotted by noobs all the time.\n\nCHEATERS: Despite the introduction of battle eye, some matches are just full of them. Just google for \"Heroes and Generals Hacks\" and you see all the xxxx there is. Aim bots, Wall Hacks, Soldier Highlighting etc. etc. Many of them in Russian language. I even get shot through rocks and walls sometimes. A few days ago, I got even shot by a sniper 2 times (not 1 miss) while in spawn protection, where you are supposed to be invisible until you leave the spawn area. Also quite often, I am running in some random bushline or forest and the planes pick me up with sniper precision (you should know that it's basically impossible to see infantry running in bushes or forests from planes, unless you have a software aid of course) And no, I was not coming out of spawn, nor was I just leaving an open field or something where they could have spotted me before.\n\nGRAPHICS: If this was the year 2010 or earlier, maybe I would say it's alright (DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE PICTURES AND VIDEOS THEY SHOW HERE, THE GAME LOOKS NOTHING...N-O-T-H-I-N-G...LIKE THIS). Despite these bad graphics, the game is SO stuttery. I usually don't have lags like many others (only on some days) BUT the movement is just not smooth at all. Compare this to Counter Strike where moving, turning etc. is just extremely smooth and enjoyable. In HnG it feels like the movement is made of thousands of tiny micro stutters. Yea it's playable but just not really enjoyable. And let's not talk about the constant game crashes when trying to join a match.\n\nDEVELOPER: Gives ZERO damn about what the community thinks - I mean ZERO. You can hardly ever see a comment of them in the forums. And if they do, it's usually to close the thread. They have a Video Q&A sometimes on twitch but those questions are obviously pre-filtered because there, nobody asks the really important things. It's just chit chat question for the CEO (who says himself he hardly ever plays the game because he has little time - well shouldn't you know about the game if you are the CEO of it???).\n\nWEAPONS BALANCE: Ridiculous. Some weapons are completely OP and many weapons you can't see xxxx because of all the cone fire and smoke when shooting. Just spray and pray.\n\nTANK, PLANE and SNIPER SPAMMING: Some battles are almost impossible to play at all. You run or drive a few meters, you are dead. Respawn and repeat, until you simply quit or run out of resources. -100 fun factor.\n\nGRINDING OR PAYING: The amount you have to play in this game to buy stuff is insane. An extreme example is the Green Peas Camo for your German soldier, which costs 790,000 credits or 4,100 Gold. Even with my super soldier with the highest salary, that would take me about 50-70 hours of pure combat to reach this (only while fighting inside a batlle earns you credits). Because of the little pay and high repair costs. Or you pay money of course, it's just below EUR 20 for that 1 piece of camo. What a bargain!! \n\nUPDATES: Once in a blue moon. Compare this to games like Rust where there are very big updates every month even. Here you have a minor, update maybe 2-3 times a year.\n\nI wish the devs of Day of Infamy/Insurgency (New World Interactive) would make a Heroes & Generals Clone with very similar gameplay but done well instead of this mess that HnG is.

It really makes me sad to see that this game had a lot of potential but the developers are ruining it. They ruin the game by: \n1.  Do whatever they want on their game since it is free 2 play, however this causes and issue because they just raise the price on classes you want to try, weapons, vehicles which is not fun since grinding takes a long time and requires a lot of patiences. However this will ruin the new players first impression of this game.\n2.  The developers just ignore their players including the veterans players. I've seen countless players reporting bugs and issues they're facing in game like being able to go through walls that was no barriers, or hit registration is not well done. I've even seen few veterans players filing reports on the discussions on what issue the game is having such as new players being constantly destroyed by veteran players, some suggested rank battles so then the new players won't have such issues or having bad experience in matches since they're going against players that have same experience as them. However all of this are being ignored by the devs, instead they focus on new contents hoping to bring new players.\n3.  The Devs are a bit ignorant. I am not saying this because I hate the devs but I've seen their videos and they barely fix a lot of things in game. Yes there were some fixes they did that made me happy. However they just post videos that nobody asked like the deep dive. Not just that I feel the devs sort of abuse their power since they are free to play and the only ww2 game so far at the moment to have both air and land forces combines together with the infantry.\n4.  The weapons...God please no...the weapons...it is just that some weapons are just really unbalanced very few weapons that feel balanced are the thompson and the mp40, and some other few weapons but many weapons I just feel that are just unbalance some weapons are overpowered and some weapons are underpowered and some weapons shouldn't be getting the same stats like the m1a1/m1 carbine having the same stats as the m2 carbine.\n5.  The servers are just plain sh*t the developers don't realise how important it is to add more servers around the world. I see countless players lagging or teleporting to another location due to very bad pings and packet loss. Usually when it comes to muliplayers the devs understand the importants of adding more servers so then players will have easier time with the ping instead of..I don't know...SMASHING THEIR DAMN TABLE BECAUSE OF THE PING AND PACKET DIFFICULT FOR PLAYERS TO EVEN PLAY THE DAMN GAME!!!\n\nI know I will be getting a lot of hate from players, but don't get the wrong idea that I hate this game. I loved this game a lot, I played it with passion and sometime rage, but it is just that with more and more issues that are popping up on Heroes and Generals recently just makes me wanna stop playing, but I don't wanna stop playing because it is fun sometime but at the same time I don't want to because it is not fun. When I see that I am going against new players it just makes me feel bad sometime because I am ruining their experience on this game, and also fustrating sometime going against players spamming vehicles like the yak, luch, hellcats, panthers, tigers, p38 and other vehicles and weapons.\n\n\n\nSo to those who have patience (LOTS OF PATIENCE) go ahead give it a try. \nTo those who wants to have some fun time and thinking about trying new weapons in a short period of time...Don't because this game takes a long time to grind and can be very VERY fustrating and upsetting.", "timestamp_created": 1518494644, "timestamp_updated": 1523753183, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814003586769104004", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23992354": {"recommendationid": "23992354", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170544330", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3262, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1467240736}, "language": "english", "review": "After being away from playing H&G for about 3 weeks I logged in to find my account had been banned because of \"cheating/hacking\".

The shooting mechanics feel solid, and the infantry weapons are fun to use. Jumping into a game as a tanker is incredibly fun and tank combat feels interesting and rewarding. And if you join into a game with a couple friends, you can have an awesome multiplayer experience that reminds me of the fun I had with early Call of Duty and Battlefield games.\n\nIt all falls apart when you actually try to start unlocking new classes, equipment, weapons, and vehicles. The level of grind required just to level up becomes exceedingly tiresome, and it only gets worse when you look at the costs you're required to pay to then make use of that leveling up. You're expected to save several hundred games worth of credits for a single new item, and that's not considering the maintenance costs you pay for repairs and rearming.\n\nThat issue has a rippling effect on the rest of the game, as it is not uncommon to get into games that are quite simply impossible to win.

Since I've played a bit and managed to get a second character that is a tanker things have gotten a bit better, but I will still run into situations where it is hopeless as I'm a light tank against medium and heavy tanks, or the enemy has uncontested air superiority and bomb me whenever I try to push forward.\n\nI sincerely hope the developers pay attention to these reviews, because this game can easily be made into something incredible with some simple changes to the leveling and in-game currency requirements.

If your attacking you must take the objective points and the points to get to the objective points. often abbreviated (o1,o2,o3)\nGuns take along time to unlock.\nIn order to be a 1 hit kill sniper, you need to mod your sniper. Mods cost $ and will drain your $ with every shot. a fully modded 1 shot sniper will not make much money.\ninfact fully modded weapons of anykind don't make good $\n--The Good--\nWhen you get used too aiming witchever weapon your using, you will destroy peeps. My kdr is 1.8.\n\n2.-Tankers-\nThe first person to shoot wins 90% of the time. Flanking is recommended, Staying in one spot is not reccomended, infantry/tankers will hunt you.\nThe way this game is balanced goes like this | Tanks kill everything easy > < So infantry can easily kill tanks\nAs a tanker you WILL have anti tank infantry chase you all game on their cars/motorcycles and blow you up easily with various anti tank weaponry\nTanking can be frustrating and i believe new players who spend all their time grinding to get a tank may be dissapointed and quit the game.\nTanks cost money. light tanks $ > medium tanks/tank destroyers $$ > heavy tanks $$$.\nIf you die too much as a expensive tank, You will lose money.\n--The Good--you can completley destroy everything you see\nI once got over 100 kills with the starting machine gun tank.\n\n3.-Airplanes-\nBiplanes are really slow and easy to shoot down | however they are cheap and the best money making plane\nfighter airplanes are really hard to aim.       | It will take along time to learn to fly effectively\nHeavy aircraft are huge targets and very expensive \nJust like tanks, if someone is behind you, death is almost 90% certan.\nCan get outnumbered big time\nCan lose money if you die alot many times\n--The Good--\nKilling enemy aircraft and sucsessfull bombing is very rewarding. (not $wise)\n\n--------Stuff-----------\n1.Versatility\nYou can play as infantry witch have multiple different weapon types | smg, assault rifles, sniper rifles, mines, anti tank.\nYou can play as a tanker and choose from iconic ww2 tanks and airplanes from each faction\nlight tanks, medium tanks, heavy tanks, tank destroyers. | biplanes , fighter planes , heavy planes.\nRandomness often leads to competely random and sometimes funny encounters\nFriends can make this game very enjoyable. Games will go by faster so you will make $ faster subcounsiously. (because your having fun)\nIf your good enough you can single handidly take points, rambo style.\n\n2.Grinding is a huge part of this game if you arent willing to throw $$$. (note $$$ has negligable effect on winning, aka not pay 2 win)\nYou mainly get payed by your soldiers hourly rate and small bonuses. As you level your hourly rate increases. (like a real job)\nA level 15 makes 14100 credits an hour. An American M1/M2 Carbine costs 183,000\nAt 14100 credits per hour, It would take you about 13 hours of ingame play.(note you always make more than your hourly rate due to bonuses. It should be shorter than 13 hours)\nYou will lose money as a tanker/airplane if you die too many times. Each vehicle has its own spawn in cost.\n\n3.Unfortinet situations\nSome games you will get completely owned witch usualy goes like this.\n--Infantry--Spawn > Run Foward > try to aim & shoot > Die > Repeat\n--Tanker--  Spawn > Drive > search for a target> tank/infantrykills you > Repeat \nIf you die too many times you LOSE money.(depending on tank)\n--Pilot--   Spawn > fly towards enemy plane > miss every shot> Die > Repeat\nIf you die too many times you LOSE money.(depending on aircraft)\nStalemates will occur with tanks/snipers shooting anyone who tries to move foward.\nTimes like this can be extremely frustrating and i believe many new players have quit over this happening to them often.\n\n4.Aiming\nAiming can be difficult. Iron sights, Recoil, and Smoke are something that takes along time to get used to.\nI suspect many new players quit because of this aswell. But if you stick with it you will get better.\n\n5.Teamates/Teamwork/Noobs\nUS faction has the most noobs who do not care about the objective and do noob things.\nRU faction has the least amount of players, has less noobs than US\nGE faction has the most experienced players, often going for the objective, good at flying/tanking/aiming. However once noobs see how good germany does, The noobs switch to german faction making GE have a decent amount of noobs.\nIf you're a tanker, rarely anyone will help defend your tank regardless of faction. Only friends will help you there.\nSomeplayers gave no idea what they are doing and do unpredictable actions.\nLots of people don't want to run back to their point thats being taken, often leading to losing every point.\n\n----Conclusion----\nI did not like this game when my friend first introduced it to me, aiming is difficult to get used to and it takes time to unlock new gear.\nBut the longer i played the better i got and i found myself really enjoying this game.\nIf you want a free 2 play ww2 first person shooter and you enjoy grinding to get new equipment and have friends to play with, You should try this game out.\n\n\n(I just tossed this together, there's more to add and better ways to organize.

Making one-shot snipers and killing you from long ranges whiles you run around with a pretty bad primary.

The biggest problem with this game is the Dev team. They just don't understand what they want this game to be, or the basics of how to make a good game period. Even though I usually get paid to consult I will give this Dev team a free hint. GAME FLOW!! \nI love WWII FPS games and the potential here is huge. The artwork is so so but passable. The map creation is lacking. The lighting is horrible. The devs need to remember that a person may play for hours so quit trying to ruin their eye sight with horrible lighting and intense fog. It's not cool looking, it's head ache material and a trip to the eye doctor.\nThe UI is terrible with all kinds of images getting in the way of seeing what you are trying to do which is playing the game. Huge cap point icons in the way of seeing another player. There is a map yanno?\nNotice banners pop up in the middle of the screen blocking what you are currently engaged in. To say that's annoying is being polite. And then there is the Deploy Que. Die in the heat of a great battle and then...wait..wait...and wait...in the deploy que. Rule 101 to a good game...NEVER destroy game flow!! There is never a good reason to destroy game flow.\nThe Grind and pricing. Oh my, where to start. Yes, you want to cause folks to earn that new weapon but making that grind turn into a career is just wrong. Pricing a pistol to cost as much as a tank is beyond belief. Charging folks to pay for weapon repair after every match is just.... well, dumb. As for the weapons themselves well that's easy...look up the stats of each weapon and set them accordingly. Somehow that thought is lost with this dev team. Vehicles made from cardboard that were designed for rough terrain but the slightest bunp in the road sends you spinning out of control. The things that make you go Hmmmm.\nThe new trendy excuse..\"This game is in BETA\" is wearing thin and the gamers need to stop supporting this nonsense. Oh, you want to try our new sandwich? That will be $4.50 and here's your two pieces of bun. The sandwich is still in BETA so maybe next month we'll put a slice of cheese between those pieces of bun and then maybe month after that we'll add some mustard to the...you get the idea. You wouldn't tolerate that for one moment so why are you gamers putting up with it in gameing?\nI only consider reviewing a game after many hours to make sure I have given a fair shake to the devs. Sadly, this game is something that could be very enjoyable if it were handed over to other devs that know how a game is supposed to work.

There was also \"veteran\" time available. \n\nAs of this new update, you can literally complete your Ribbon levels ( thus unlocking both weapons and modifications) by paying real money without having ever played a match.\n\n\"But we can use silver!\" \n\nYes. we can, and this is great for those of us who have been playing for a year or more, and have literally a Million Silver credits or more stacked up from previous earning rates in different builds.\n\n However, newer players, or even players that have 100 hours in the game, won't be able to take advantage of this.

This may not make perfect sense for someone who has never played the game, but for example, it took me 15+ hits to kill a Hellcat tank with my Panther. Only for the tanker to bail and for someone else to claim the acutal tank kill. I ended up with zero reward for that kill and instead took all of the damage. None of the other players took any damage from the encounter. The so called \"balance\" that the developers tried to create messed up the balance there was before the update. Don't let this game fool you into palying it with the free to play and fancy graphics. It's a cluster f*** of veteran players destroying novice players. The grind for weapons is terribly long now and frustating. Famous youtubers used to stream and play this game but every single one slowly left because of how the developers treat veteran players.

That will be awesome!\" I started playing a map and suddenly these brand new Soviet characters were charging down the field like an unstoppable beast, capturing all of the points and one-shotting all of my teammates. Map after map, it was the brand new Soviet characters winning.\n\nIf they were just added to the game, how are they outperforming players that have been playing for a year?!?!\n\nThe answer is that the newest update has really leveraged the pay to win, and most of the soviet teams' characters were bought with real money as an \"Academy - Trained Character.\" Academy trained is basically a cheat code to bypass INSANE amounts of play time.

The ability to actually hide in bushes, no big name tags over enemy heads giving away the hiding spot, camo working the way it does in real life, making you hard to see.  The leveling system WAS pretty cool ranking up ribbons and gaining levels to unlock new class like tanker and paratrooper all the way to general. And of course the persistent war that was run by players at officer level allocating resources and assault teams to be fought out by the players.  I liked the no third person view in a tank but being forced to see through the vision slit, or pop your head out of the turret hatch for a better look and pray nobody popped ya...\n\nThe game gave way, WAY more xp for capturing and holding control points rather then kills and the plenty of  ribbon upgrades (that unlock all the vehicles, weapon mods, and special traits) that were not tied directly to combat would gain xp by you doing smart things in the game, like moving slowly, crouching, picking up teamates in transport vehicles, sprinting etc...It was a nice blend of realism and fun with plenty to do.

First of all I really wanted this game to be good (and in some cases it is) i love concept of WW2 FPS. \nUnfortunately there are tons of problems! \nGame is clearly pay to win. The amount of money you earn after a battle is so little it barely is enough for fixing and ammmunition. So in the end it's incredible grind fest to get a single weapon in this game (prizes of weapons are ridicolous).\nSecondly the level progress is also painfully slow. Recently they changed lvl exp caps and it's almost impossible for newbies to reach high levels (beside no-lifing or paying ofc) \nMoreover there is another problem!!! So you work your way to the 9th lvl or so and want to become sniper (all in all you were one-shoted so many times by high lvl, full gear players so you want revange) so you pay for becoming sniper AND THAN you have to buy a SNIPER RIFLE for like 150k ingame money. What THE FUCK is that. You paid to be a sniper and you have to additionally buy a sniper rifle in order to play it!?!?!? and 150k is a loooot of money if you don't wnat to pay real money.\n\nAND the balance of the game... even in staged battles which were supposed to be well \"staged\" and equal to every side. You end up being slaughtered buy 5 tanks when there is no tank-driver player in your squad!!! or you're constantly bombed by pilots cuz there is nobody to take it down.\n\nLastly... optimalization is a joke. My PC can easily run BF4 on high with decent fps ( close to 60). Not this game. And I'm pretty sure it looks way worse and mechanics are simpler...\n\nALL IN ALL there are some positives. Some matches are fun, When teams are balanced it's a satisfactory game.

This review is focused on the FPS bit of the game.\n\nChoose between 3 different factions, German (most populated), US (most annoying) and Russian (most... I don't know) and stick your nose into different sized, objective driven maps in large open fields, small towns and forests. Depending on the game mode, you're either defending or attacking objectives, special areas which determine if you lose or win the fight.\n\nThere are 5 different careers for you to choose from (Infantry, tank driver, plane pilot, paratrooper and recon,) though a fresh account starts with the basic infantry man. One on each faction. As you play the game, you earn money with which you can buy new guns, vehicles, weapon modifications or brand new soldier careers at your leisure.\n\nInfantry is your basic soldier shoot-man. The backbone of the army and the one that gets blown to pieces the most. They're the most versatile career and have plenty of different weapons and vehicles to unlock throughout the game. They're also the most essential people on the field and a fight without enough infantry is quickly lost.\n\nTank driver has access to tanks and can spawn in the map as such. They have limited weapons, but the ability to get different tanks more than enough makes up for this.\n\nPilots have the least weapons to choose from, but they get to fly planes themselves and shoot down the enemy planes and bomb ground targets to bits.\n\nParatroopers are like infantry, but with slightly more limited weapon options and instead of running or driving to the objectives, they  deploy from a special transport aircraft, parachuting down from above.\n\nRecon is your dedicated sniper career. The only soldier that has access to the powerful 8x magnification scopes for his rifle and some special mods not available for any other soldier.\n\nThe gameplay loops is pretty decent. You either have one or more attack lines (A, B, C, D and E) on which you'll spawn in as the soldier career you play as, attacking the defending enemy lines and objectives (O1, O2 and O3). Or you might do the defence instead. On some maps there are only objectives and no attack lines at all. In those maps the faction who holds the majority of the objectives for the longest will win the fight. \n\nEach match has a set amount of resources for all participating factions. This determines how many times your team can spawn in as their chosen soldier career and how many tanks, planes or vehicles they can spawn with. Run out of soldiers and you can't respawn when you die, thus you lose the fight. Though, nowadays this is quite rare.\n\nThe gameplay feels a bit arcadey. Soldiers move much faster than they should be able to, can jump like they were on the moon and the power of ADAD is extremely strong in this game. It wasn't like this back in 2014 when I first started. The game felt much more slower paced and realistic. The introduction of rifle scopes for regular infantry also hurt the game more than the devs care to admit.\n\nOne thing this game gets absolutely right though, are uniform camos. They really work and sometimes you'll be hard pressed to spot a soldier lying on the ground or crouching in the shadows or in bushes, just because they blend in so well.\n\nAll guns, tanks and vehicles handle differently and they all have unique sounds. You'll learn to recognize which weapon is being fired and which of the several different vehicles is moving nearby. The overall sound quality is nothing to get excited about, but it does its job.\n\nAs you play, every action you do gains points towards different ribbons. As you level up these ribbons, you unlock new guns, gun modifications, vehicles and badges. Badges modify your soldier abilities. They let you have a more steady hand while firing, start with more ammo, deal more damage with explosives, sprint longer, steal cars faster, etc. whereas the gun modifications make your gun deal more damage, have a longer range of fire, be more accurate or fire faster.\n\nYou also earn money as you play. Your soldier has an hourly base salary which is based on your soldier's rank. The longer the match lasts, the more money you get. In addition to the base salary, you also earn extra for doing things, such as killing the opposition, capturing points, patching wounds, repairing vehicles, exploding things etc.\n\nAll your equipment wears out as you use them, so some of that salary income is going towards keeping your guns and items in good condition. Once they wear out completely, you can't use them and you'll have to fix them at some point.\n\nYou also earn gold for the first fight of the day. Gold is the \"premium\" currency and can be bought with real money. Everything you can get with gold you can get with the default currency as well. The grind to unlock weapons, careers and gear through the default currency is not nearly as big of a deal as people sometimes try to make you believe.\n\nThere are no squad communication though outside the text chat between your own squad and the rest of the friendly team. So don't expect strategy being a huge part of any fight, unless you play with friends. Most of the time it's a RUSH B! type of deal, hoping you wont get gunned down immediately.\n\nThere are no suppression mechanics in the game either. Wounds don't make your soldier perform any worse and generally there's no fear of death. It's not uncommon to shoot somebody in the back, score a hit (or several) and then see them turning around just to one shot kill you.\n\nOverall the game feels a bit too fast paced. Everybody's rushing in like crazy with automatic weapons, spamming grenades and pooping mines like they were candy, not caring if they die in the process or not. There's potential here for H&G to be a much, much better game. But I'm not keeping my hopes very high.\n\nEven still, I'd say give the game a try. It's quite fun in moderation.

The devs are US biased that is not a secret. They are not focused on the quality of the game rather the quantity of the players. The target of the game are not the long term players - the weekly 200 new players are more important than the veterans who play for 5 years (weekly 20 leave). The quantity if the equipments is more important than the quality. You can also see everywhere that the strategy now is advertisement and marketing (new UI for the website and teasers for every update and lots of social media activity and twitch partnerships) and the money spent on the quality of the game is rather small.\n\nConclusion: \nYou log in you are stunned how fancy and what a massive quantity of guns and vehicles you have ->\nYou spend money to skip the loooong time needed to unlock them ->\n You realize that was a mistake and you face all the huge issues of the game -> \nYou quit the game ->\nThey win cz the money you gave will be spent on marketing and looks and appeal so that even more will fall into it.\n\nLong:\nGermany started to have all the pro fps players from red orchestra and since in the beginning there was not Soviet faction pro fps gamer russians also joined Germany. All sorts of noob players started to swarm Germany and the better players were winning the wars so they nerfed Germany to the ground.\n\nThat still didn't stop the overpopulation of the German faction. Soviets were added(Humiliating US and Germany with their secret spawn time bonus which was revealed by players and hastely removed after a half year of Soviet domination). Underdog bonus was added but they still couldnt solve anything in that matter so they decided to nerf the Germans even more and whenever they add anything new to the other factions it will be a guaranteed overkill to germany - instead of listening to the community in this matter.\n\nThere are obvious problems in the game which they refuse to fix and instead they add unwanted equipment and ridicoulusly rare ww2 guns and vehicles and skins. They rather feel like working against the community by ignoring all the problems and adding unwanted things to the game instead. The customers are not a focus here and that is a sign of bad management.\n\nGood example: We used to have only one type of planes. That one type ended up for the US in the heavy fighter category meaning after the plane update every US pilot had the heavy fighter already. The freshly added german and Soviet heavy fighters are slower, they have a larger turn angle and wing mounted guns which render them imprecise a little but that alone is not a big deal. This effectively means that you cant get rid of a US heavy plane, you cant outmanouver or outrun it. No matter what manouver you do they will be able to follow you and if you try to catch them they can easily lose you. They dominate the air 100% in the heavy fighter category and they do so in fact so much that in only about 2-4% of the matches do the US pilots have any enemy at all(these are most likely ppl who just unlocked the german or the soviet heavy and they want to try it). \n\nAfter 1.5 years of total US heavy air domination the CEO had no idea about it and Reto Gargamel said that there is probably no issue and it could be only the fact that players see the p38 the most cz it used to be a starter plane and its unlocked for everyone who played before the air update. Thats it...\nhttps://heroesandgenerals.com/2018/07/did-you-miss-yesterdays-ama/?utm_source=ingameHub&utm_medium=IngameHub&utm_campaign=IngameHub\n\nSome other examples:\nTanks: Tank gameplay still unplayable due to tank hunter infantry and the unfair repair costs for tanks above light tanks. \n\nPlanes: OP38 still rocks the heavy fighter class and none even dares to challange since it costs a gigaton of credits to spawn it. General control update to the planes killed the fun and its too easy to control them. You can still kill people in the water if you drop your bomb into the river.\n\nPoor infantry: Infantry gameplay is somewhat fun but the hitbox problems, the unresolved problem of lagging players, bullets stuck in the air 10cm above the frame of a window, heavy set on everyone so players who don't have vet membership suffer, Infantry scopes deter people from playing the objective... these are issues that were around for 4 years.\n\nRecons: You can very easily end up negative or break even when you play a recon with OHK sniper. Still no XP for spotting. Recons are sill only rewarded for capturing which is not suitable for the scoped gun and the lack of equipment slots. New maps make the long range sniper kills a lot harder. The whole recon gameplay needs a redesign.\n\nGeneral issues: The maps are the same although they have been redesigned they are still the same boring maps. Repair costs are still way above sensible. New players are just thrown into the meatgrind. Clans are still allowed to play against randomly grouped players. Game modes are also boring and the encounter game mode is just even worse.\n\nThere are a lot more examples but time is short and here is what I observed:\n\nThe weekly X new players are the target of this game. Quantity of guns and vehicles and maps and skins instead of quality.\nBy the time you realize this you spent a lot of money and you played for a short time which is profitable versus the veterans who dont spend that much money and they reveal major issues.\n\nConclusion: \nYou log in you are stunned how fancy and what a massive quantity of guns and vehicles you have ->\nYou spend money to skip the loooong time needed to unlock them ->\n You realize that was a mistake and you face all the huge issues of the game -> \nYou quit the game ->\nThey win cz the money you gave will be spent on marketing and looks and appeal so that even more will fall into it.\n\nTHIS IS A TRAP", "timestamp_created": 1531652533, "timestamp_updated": 1532262171, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.754661262035369873", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Hello robotpilot,\n\nWe are sorry to hear you had a negative experience with Heroes & Generals.

The most prominent eye-opener for me in this case was when I found out that the developers are shrugging at the people dedicating themselves to extensively griefing people and pushing them under the rug category as \"minor trolls\" without taking any action: http://imgur.com/a/s4uuA and permanently banning people on the forums for trying to blow the whistle on this fact: http://i.imgur.com/H2M1KPq.jpg (See http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097940740/recommended/227940/)\n\nYes, that's right. Someone posting in the FORUMS and leaving a NEGATIVE game review got his IN-GAME account PERMANENTLY BANNED without actually doing anything against the ToS IN THE GAME ITSELF.\n\nI did some further digging and oh boy do these guys commit themselves to doing some shady cr\u00e0p, especially in the topic of the buy-able ingame currency known as gold. I've asked a few friends about it too and almost everyone who bought gold (or thought about it) has seen the prices for them constantly change and swap around, after not long, I came across this image: http://i.imgur.com/yut1Wkj.jpg\n\nWhich I traced back to this Reddit thread that has tons of people all being the victim (and observers) of the same thing, Reto-Moto changing and swapping the prices around, paying little to no heed as to just what country you are in unless the currency is worth more along with the prices themselves changing without notice: https://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesandGenerals/comments/3k8bnz/hg_gold_prices_same_country_different_account_wtf/\n\n\"Huh\". I said to myself as I browsed through the thread and recently thought back to the one customer support I've had with them: http://imgur.com/3jahD4Z\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nI brushed it off at the time but now I'm starting to get some understanding for all the overhanging greedy & shady cr\u00e0p that's going on in this company and most of it seems to come right back to this \"Gargamel\" character, a neckbearded fellow (whom i can only describe as a manchild that goes by the name \"Fred\" from his biography described boners of playing nothing but retro games, listening to electro music and cosplaying WWII) that has the official job title of being a \"Community assistant\". The few Steam forum posts I've seen him make can only help me draw the conclusion that he is an extremely toxic, arrogant and sadistic individual that is doing his very best to sh\u00ectsmear, indiscriminatively perma-ban and push anyone off the rails who is even marginally thinking about giving the company he works for and/or their game Heroes & Generals some form of criticism or negative feedback, one way or another: http://imgur.com/MQ0itdm\n\nHe also has a view that can only be seen as over-zealous when It comes to their anticheat system where he has essentially taken the stance of it being 100% fool-proof with no false positives even being in the realms of a tangible possibility: http://imgur.com/9HCKOjr\n\nBut the most shocking point for me was how much of a small portion of the community knew what was going on as I kept finding more and more proof of just what kind of ship they were running: http://imgur.com/AVHxx1j\n\nEventually, I came across this wordpress page: https://amonsul1155.wordpress.com/2015/03/23/hello-world/\n\nAnd holy cr\u00e0p.

The game is incredibly grindy and the grind has only been made harder over the years, for instance the price to buy a new class of soldier has doubled, Everything in the game has upkeep to pay everytime you use it and using high teir equipment can even lead to a match where equipment expenses far outweighs the earnings from the match. The game is very much pay to win as a person that pays for a membership gets 2 \"badge\" slots rather than 1 (the badges give powerful buffs like 15% damage reduction, 25% better hip fire, and no kill cam, among many others). Many balance issues exist in game that the devs blatantly ignore, such as Russia having the only AT gun in the entire game (and the only teir 3 submachine gun), the U.S having by far the worst aircraft for the longest time.\n\nDevelopment has stagnated for a very long time, while there are updates containing small features like new vehicles, many highly anticipated features have been missing for years. The last new map was added 2 years ago back in 2015 (with the exclusion of a tiny map focused around one small building). this is worsened by the fact that the game only has 5 full sized maps and 4 small ones. The player cap in a match is 18vs18 and despite years of the dev's promising higher counts nothing has changed. Recent updates THIS YEAR have brought such features as: Tutorials for beginners, Medics, and Water Physics. All features that most FPS hold as core mechanics that are now just being added. More concerningly is the multiple sound, graphics, and lighting overhauls.

For a little bit, this game seemed quite promising. Yeah, things were a grindfest and some maps were a bit lame, but with every new update your soldiers would get a bunch of XP and in-game currency (which you need to buy new weapons, vehicles, etc.)--making the grind not so bad--and there was a steady supply of new maps and updates.\n\nHowever, once the game officially went out of beta in 2016, the quick XP and coins from the updates dried up, and it seemed like things were made more expensive and difficult to level up. (Perhaps worst of all, things were changed making it more difficult to get a soldier who was a sniper, tanker, or paratrooper class. You couldn't just level your soldier up and switch class anymore, you had to buy a new class). On top of this, map tweaks to things like spawnpoints ensured you now spent much more time running than fighting.\n\nFor a time, it seemed like this game had the potential to fill the large-scale combined arms niche that BF1942 once filled, but now Heroes and Generals is only fun if you're willing to pay piles of money to avoid the grind, or if your soldiers are already leveled up.

Back then it was still fairly raw and a game in development.\n\nI really enjoyed the combined arms aspect of this game where it combined air force, infantry and armor on the same map. In a sense it was a nice flashback to Battlefield 1942.\n\nI've since played it fairly regularly now over the years and seen many of the updates that have been rolled out. New weapons, new vehicles and new toys as well as a couple new maps (3 to be precise, so one per year since I started roughly) and revamp of existing maps as well.\n\nHowever, despite the new toys being added there are numerous issues that have prevailed for, literally, years without being resolved. Some things get resolved while other times things are added to the game, very quickly identified by the community as flawed and yet it takes the developer months upon months without reacting. In fact, despite the issues being highlighted, discussed, suggestions and ideas thrown around by the community, the developer remains disturbingly quiet. An example of this is the Soviet PTRD which was capable of one-shotting jeeps full of players from long ranges, as well as capable of shooting down aircraft. It was a one-man army tool for oneshotting jeeps, infantry and 3-shotting airplanes.\n\nHas it been fixed now? Their solution was to make it less accurate by adding RNG sway and larger cone of fire / dispersion pattern for the weapon, thus removing any control the player has over where the bullet will actually go. Fixed? Or just further broken? Still widely discussed, and not a word from developer.\n\nThe longer you play this game the more and more of these issues you become aware of. And when you start to investigate by looking at Reddit, in the Steam discussions or their official forums one thing quickly becomes clear. The community is passionate and eager for the game to succeed. There are hours and hours of feedback and suggestions, and by that I mean constructive feedback and suggestions and not just childish \"other team has OP stuff, plz nerf\". People invested enourmous amounts of effort into this.\n\nHowever.. it all disappears into a black hole and the developer remains completely silent about the issues.\n\nHow can they be silent you wonder? They have devstreams on Twitch regularly.\n\nYou are correct, they do. However they never bring up the issues that have plagued the game and frustrated the community for months (even years in some cases). Instead it's showcasing new things coming, showing how they work and other stuff which is nice, but does not address the core frustrations.\n\nI have personally been passionately involved with the game and have over 6000 posts on their forum. But even someone as stubborn and full of grit as myself reaches and end point where even the sunk cost fallacy is unable to convince me that there is a brighter future for the game.\n\nI don't see it.

If Yes this is the game for You, becouse it has a ton of it. You have to grind everything, some of it are fairly easy to grind (for example MP40, thats not that bad of a grind), bet there are a lot others like the STG44 which takes an awful lot of time. Ofc you can BOOST everything. Sidenote: You can buy EVERYTHING with credits (in-game non-paid currency) which is nice. I think credit-earning wise the game is well balanced (could be better). With a little smart management you will never get -credits after a match (refills, repair, etc.). But you have to grind. After 500+ hour I still did not unlocked everything, not even with one nation.\n\nI almost missed the most important, in this game you prefferably have more soliders (you can't change your loadout during a match) for example: Infantry with machine gun, infantry with rifle, medic infantry, anti-tank infantry, tanker, pilot, paratrooper, recon. And wathever you like.\n\nPersonally I think Veteran bonus not that strong. I only use it when we get it from promotion or holiday etc. The bonus credit and the 2nd badge slot is the best part of the veteranship (which you can also buy from credits). But you can play without them.\n\nI think in the last year the game was really underwhelming. They added a lot of unuseful things or things that further worsening the grind. They added baby pistols, so you have much worse pistols to grind the better ones.\nThe worst thing came not too long ango that they prioritized the addition of HELM SKINS over VEHICLE HANDLING improvement (which is awful, we really need to patch that btw.).\n\nThe matches are qiute fun if you can get over the early grind (you are bind to an unmodded G43 at the start of every character, its very frustrating after the 2nd or 3rd infantry assault grind). The spawnpoints are mostly placed awful, there are points that almost impossible to capture with a decent enemy, and there are points where you spawn 1km away from the point, with no bike or civil vehicle to get to the point. Running simulator is real. There are still spawncamping, but its not that bad than earlier.\n\nTo be a pilot in this game is the hardest thing, but also VERY rewarding. But tanking is really bad as it is for now. Do you know how many enemies needed to destroy a K\u00f6nig Tiger? Just one. They can ride their bikes to you, throw 2-4 bombs at you or shoot you with a bazooke 2-4 times and you are destroyed, can't do anything. And there are dedicated players for this. They just roam around and hunt tanks. And very hard to notice them becouse the sounds in this game... really need some improvment.\n\nOh yeah, I almost forgot, there is a thing in this game which is really disgousting, its called ASSIMETRIC BALANCE. For example, russians have their armored cars, and PTRD which have no alternatives in other nations. The light tanks and the tank destroyers got some assimetric things too. I mean historywise its fine, but it can be really frustrating, But you can still have your fun.\n\nThe WAR mode is what really keeps me playing. The matches are more rewarding (more with underpopulation bonus, least played nations earn more stuff). The word map and the assault team management is a really awesome conception. After you reach lvl 12 you can manage your own troops on the worldmap and support players playing on thoose battlefields (for example sending them 30 infantry and 12 bikes to spawn). This will be your primary XP source after lvl12. And its fun.\n\nI really hope devs will not abandon this game, they should focus a lil bit more on important stuff (e.g. BUG FIXES, new maps, new weapons (but not like these baby pistols), etc) and less on skins and unimportant sh*t.

People in tanks and planes which you have no good counter to and snipers that can one hit you with a bodyshot which is ridiculous, the rifles should do 99 damage maximum with a headshot needing to score you the one hit kill. This game isn't CoD and a rifle shouldn't one hit kill someone to the torso up to the distances that they do in this game but this is only one of the many glaring balance issues facing new players.\n\nThe base weapons when you buy them [b]should not[/b] be half as powerful as the same weapons but with upgrades leaving you at a distinct disadvantage to those who have spent more time in the game than you, or someone who has thrown money at the game. The fact a game with this much potential is being held back by what seems to be blatant greediness by the developer is a real shame.

But at first it didn't seems to bad the immersion was excellent and I enjoyed hitching rides on player's jeeps to the front line where I would hold the building against the other team (that part I enjoyed most) The best part was the P2W aspect wasn't bothering me too much. Sure the fact we had to buy our own ammo let alone weapons was annoying (not really accurate). But it wasn't to bad at the moment I was actually thinking of giving a positive reveiw on this maybe even an 9/10.\n\nThen I reached level 3.\n\nI tried out the new modes that were unlocked for me and I was thrown into an unbalanced, annoying, unfun game of who-paid-the-most. Crushed by tanks, head shotted from superb snipers. Sprayed by suprieor weapons. I couldn't defend myself since what good is a MP34 against a one-shotting Soviet Anti-Tank Rifle? (also I'm pretty sure that useing such a weapon against infantry is banned by the Geneva convention) I just simply wasn't ready for the shitstorm of advanced players after level 3. What is also annoying AF is the lack of communication abilties among your teamates. If i've cornered by 5 guys and need to request help. There is no time to press t and type *need help at X2* because they would've sprayed you by then. Since there is no voice chat in the game. Another complait I have is the combat in general, it feels clunky slightly better than DayZ, but still clunky.\n\nThen there is the biggest complaint of all from not just me, but from multiple people! The god-awful, rage-inducing, hair-pulling, life shortening, Pay 2 Win system. It's simple, if you don't pay, you gotta grind for hours upon hours just for a new gun! In the amount of time I played, I still just have a MP34. And whats even worse is when your creamed by some guy with the best weapons in the game who just forked over some cash.\n\nThis is why this game cannot be reccomended at all to the great people of steam. I would give it a 1/10 thanks to the semi-helpful community. But I give a 9/10 to the game before you reach level 3.\n\n(another thing that will truely piss you off is the number of people *especially when playing the soviet faction* who people use anti-tank weapons against infantry *a certain one-hit kill*)\n\nAnother thing I think this game could have is a humans VS bots system, I can't be the only one who likes a little practise system when PvP gets to be too much. It would certainly keep me coming back. I know it's possible because of the tutorial segment of the game. I can't be the only one who likes to destroy bots every now and then\n\n*edit* The new update from what I can tell, makes the P2W even worse, now you can pay to level up your ribbions!\n\n*more edit* now you cannot deny that is it P2W since now the devs have raised the price of everything again! the weapons are crazy expensive, the mp40 is now over 100,000 credits, the kar 98 is no better, 89,000 credits. even the shitty mp34 is 45,000 credits! really?\n\n*even more edit* As suggested by D3uterzx, the main reason why each game is who-has-the-most-tanks, is because the weapons required for infantry to get rid of them is extremly expensive with some poor souls racking up thousands in costs and making it worth it more to simply leave the game and wait for it to end.\n\nXYLANDER UPDATE:\n\nI came back to the game after I saw that A new update came out. I check out all of it's new features and frankly, all the previous issues were still there. However, I must say that for some reason, the war games i played were much more fun than when I played on staged servers. Possibly because EVERY match wasn't spawncamped by tanks (because there weren't tanks or not that many. And for the first time since lvl 3, I actually had fun in war mode. The 50% more XP was also a bonus.\n\nBut an issue that came with war are the long queue times. Never in my life have i waited HALF AN HOUR to get into a game. Only for it to be almost over. It just needs to be fixed\n\nThe new credit system, make more as you play sounds good, got me interested. Maybe its becasue im only rank 6, but I'm still making around 5,000-6,000 a match. So, no differece there.\n\nThe battle Director, that seemed like the next best thing since sliced bread. Reto is probaly gonna tweak it anyway. But for me i got matches with respawns such as 200 my team v 5,000 spawns on other team. great idea though.\n\nBasicly, as of now, same game as last time. \n\nPS can RETO please do something about the OHK rifles everyones running around with?

Every gameplay mechanic imaginable is broken in some way or another. Hackers run rampant and the anticheat will never catch them because it is pathetic much like the game. After 4 years, many of the same bugs errors and much more remain everyday problems, and every update only makes them worse and or creates new problems. The developer follows it's 'silent majority' path every single time something needs adressed, and you and I both know its so they can make another quick buck.\n\nThe player grind has been made worse and worse (revised ribbon system, revised squad system) and the only way to avoid it is to play for insane number of hours or buy gold. Even should you play upwards of 80 hours a week you will never get anywhere because of the ridiculous amount of crap to do in order to have a well balanced character set. The tank and plane system is horrendously broken, and the weapons are absolutely screwed, there are constant buffs/nerfs going on everything and none of the weapon stats at any point make any sense. Can you name a game where bolt action rifles take 3 hits to kill until they're 'upgraded'? Didn't think so, but thats okay because you can make them kill in one hit but its prohibitively expensive until you're a higher level or buy insane amounts of gold. The 'war bonds' system is absolutely ridiculous, you can invest a nearly real $400 USD of gold to get back something like $20 worth of gold (only after a 3 month wait, naturally). After Rommel deployment queues became \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, and now you get even worse, more easily camped locations to spawn in. The RTS system has been and continues to be seriously broken. You used to even be able to buy guns and mods for them with gold, but now you have to unlock or buy the 'ribbons' (XP) for them first. Veteran (P2W) memberships used to yield actual ingame credit boosts, but those have naturally been nerfed over and over. Veteran is now being forced down any 'expert' players throat because you are literally being required to buy it to access the previously standard (two) combat badge slots. If this is the way they want their game to be, they should just bring in a $100 pack that unlocks all the crap you'd need. The game only becomes increasingly harder to actually play as a 'new guy' or 'f2p', its actually unbelievable to see this happen to what was the WW2 game with the most potential for a while.\n\nThe new sound occlusion system is \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665, you can't even tell if people are firing right next to you or not because \"theres something in the way\". Hit registration is ridiculous and the servers haven't gotten any better. The matchmaking system is so bad that its possible to get all tanks vs all airplanes (and I've even seen it happen). Shaders got way worse and the graphics haven't gotten a tad better since even Alpha. All guns are now loaded up with ridiculously bright and unrealistic tracers, although surely this wasn't made to combat snipers since you can now carry over 4 medkits as a single infantryman. The weight system makes not a shred of sense, and even after bringing Paratroopers back they made them useless by disallowing them to carry anything. Your character will need to move by foot most of your time throughout gameplay, but everyone has severe asthma even with *those* 'upgrades', and then the snipers will finish you off after all that running now that shoulder turns into jello and cannot be used to stabilize your rifle or machine gun. Even if they don't, you will be slaughtered by tanks. This effectively makes the entire spawn system useless. The vehicle physics suck, cars will do a 180 degree spin at the slightest turn, motorcycles will absolutely spaz out whenever and wherever possible, and bicycles (the one free to use method of transport) also act like crap.\n\nAlthough none of this matters when they ban your account because you are doing too good, and I'm serious about this. It seems that when you actually start buying gold and or getting more skillful, that you are banned for \"cheating\", as it's happened to me twice and it seems that I'm not the only person with this issue -- Please read other negative reviews and you will see more evidence of this. The only time the devleopment team arrives to talk to players is when they write up intelligent arguments and complaitns like those in this review. Game mechanics are written with making another penny in mind, and thats practically it. At least half if not more of the updates in recent memory add a new camoflauge or some other dumb thing to keep you spending money on the game, even though not a single person asked for any of this crap. The only reason this isn't in \"beta\" anymore is because steam would've removed it from the platform. For the amount of money they must make from all this junk its amazing that they don't just add EAC or BattlEye, but then again that would unfortunately kill off about 2/3 of their buying playerbase, hackers that just keep coming back. The people behind this game are not developers, developers understand basic elements of a multiplayer game, Reto does not.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTL:DR Fun for about 2-3 hours, and then it becomes crushingly impossible AND/OR expensive. Developers are toxic, greedy and fraudulent, the game slowly dies more and more every day, and soon Reto-Moto shall be remembered as \"The Little Dev Team That COULD NOT\", that is until they move onto their next massive scam of a project. Unless you are okay with a 500 hour grind for a \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 game that will force you to start over by banning you, stay away.", "timestamp_created": 1472109299, "timestamp_updated": 1499595942, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705882370471954346", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31228773": {"recommendationid": "31228773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062330063", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 42379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1162, "last_played": 1551844909}, "language": "english", "review": "You know that guy who slaughters all the noobs with highly advanced weaponry that makes everything feel unbalanced? I'm that guy. I was the dude who looked up all the stats for every gun, knows the armor thickness and speed of every tank in the game, and consistantly topped the leaderboard. I played for a while, not as long as some, much longer than others. And I had a lot of fun. I paid about $15 once because I figured all the problems in this game could be fixed if I helped out a little bit, but all the rest of it, the OHK sniper rifle, my super high level American, I got that all through grinding. And it wasn't even a grind sometimes, I had fun.\n\nBut I can't recommend this game. If you don't already have at least my amount of time in this game, you're done. It used to be that you started with one soldier from each faction and had grenades to go with your starting weapon. You had something to get you up on your feet. Not any more. I've seen the expenses of every item go up nearly double. It went from being bordering on unreasonable to almost insane. But I already had the good gear on one of my characters, so I kept playing. Firing thirty bullets from my rifle cut into half my earnings and other equipment brought me near to breaking even. So I had to nerf my own character to continue playing, and I couldn't go back to my nub characters without being so badly killed I didn't have fun. \"Git gud\" doesn't apply here. I've been on the other end of the slaughter. There is nothing a new player to stand against someone with better equipment except take pot shots at a distance and hope to scrap together some XP, which isn't fun. And if a game isn't fun, its not worth playing.\n\nThe real nail in the coffin is the technical issues. It got so bad that I couldn't stay in a match for more than a minute before the entire game went bonkers. After a couple days of this, I just stopped trying. It really isn't worth the trouble.\n\nTL;DR\nIt was fun, now its not because grind/technical issues/not new player friendly. Give it a shot if you want, could be your cup of tea, wasn't mine. This is an opinion, just like every review. Treat it as such when you are making your decision, and bear in mind its free-to-play, so there's no harm in trying it yourself.\n\nUPDATE: 16MAY18\n\nOver one year since the original review. Nothing much has changed, now they've added Battleye to prevent cheating. I've never witnessed any cheating (not saying it isn't there), and Battleye seems offensively intrusive. You have to have it to play. If you are fine subjecting your computer to that to ensure fair play on a game, go for it. Cracking down on cheating is fine, maybe a year from now they'll get around to improving the core gameplay. 'Free' is still an excellent price if you like the grind.\n\nTLDR; Nothing new, added Battleye.

There is no formula, there is no balance, nothing! \n\nHuge groups of experienced clans or premades can go up against brand new players with stock guns and they just don't have a chance. And it's not like it happens every so often, it's literally 8 out of 10 games consist of veteran players vs brand new players. In my 50 hours in the game (at the time of writing this review), I'd say about 5 of them were actual close games. The rest were mostly my team stomping new players or my team getting stomped by vets with everything unlocked.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\nThe majority of my games my team would be down in players. I had a TON of games where it would be something like 8 v 12 since the beginning of the game and nothing changes. We don't get team mates, get stomped all game and it's over. And on the flip side the same thing occurs, my team would have 10 players vs like 5-6 and the games aren't even close. Do you see a pattern forming here? \n\nTL:DR The game is NOT balanced in many different ways (matchmaking, guns, tanks, etc) and will result in a poor matchmaking experience the majority of the games you play unless you either spend money or spend an INSANE amount of time grinding and grinding.", "timestamp_created": 1469737050, "timestamp_updated": 1469737050, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.623866915702819824", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23204498": {"recommendationid": "23204498", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141372486", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 22544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 25, "last_played": 1551381642}, "language": "english", "review": "Goddamn.\nI use to love this game\nIn fact i still really do.\nBut this new update, the squad update, Really shivered me timbers.\nWhile i still play this game, i can not reccomend it to anyone.\nMaybe before the squad update, but after it, No.\nLet it be said here, That the \"Devyatayev\" Update marks the absolute shitty downfall for H&G\n\nEdit-\nGame came out!\nDoes that matter?\nNo, still shit.", "timestamp_created": 1464195279, "timestamp_updated": 1474684998, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.660162389278411865", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42090032": {"recommendationid": "42090032", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034882061", "num_games_owned": 188, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 71186, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550298112}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is actually very very FUCKED.

Those screenshots are graphically enhanced... meaning the graphics in the game looks nothing like them.\n\nI started playing this game a year ago, in April of 2015. I have had 730 hours in the game. I have written 2 previous reviews for this game. The first one was a negative one that I wrote after playing the game for 2 months, and spent 200 hours on it. The second review was a positive one after playing the game for 5 months and having spent 400 on it.\n\nNow this is my third review of this game, and I am sad to have to change my overwhelming positive review to a negative one. This game has been slowly going down hill for the past 6 months/updates (since they have an update every month).\n\nThough most of negative stuff I have to say comes from the update 4 months ago (the Adam's Build).\n\nThe main problem with this game has always been how the developers at Reto decide to \"balance\" things. The problem is so obvious to everyone on the forums except Reto to the point that we all joke about it. We call it \"Reto Logic\u2122\". \n\nThe problem with \"Reto Logic\u2122\" is that they make the most absurd and silly excuses and reasons to do the most crude, unpolished, illogical methods of attempting to balance the game.\n\nFor instance, tank drivers can't initiate a manual reload for their turret mounted coaxial machines guns, or autocannons if you have a Panzer II tank. Reto claims that this is done for game balance... but meanwhile all other vehicles' support machine guns can be reloaded at any given time... Even the support gunner machine gun on a tank can be reloaded... So instead of doing something more logical for the sake of balance like giving the tank driver a slower reload, they just completely disable the ability to reload at all... and the only way for you to reload is by wasting all your ammo in your current clip which not only gives away your position, but wastes extra time.\n\nAnother example is the American M1919 .30 Browning Machine Gun. Most players complain that the rangefinder (iron sight) on the gun is way to optically obstructive for the gun to be used effectively, and ask for it to be flipped down. Reto says no, tells us that the rangefinder blocking most of your screen is there for balance. So instead of balancing the gun statistically, they decide to basically blind the user instead.\n\nAnother example of \"Reto Logic\u2122\", is instead of simply tweaking stats accordingly they basically decided in the past couple of months just to make every gun unusable. For instance they have been adding muzzle residue clouds to all automatic guns... this wouldn't be a problem at all if they were simply just small highly transparent aesthetic animations.... but no they are large, densely dark residue clouds that are equivalent to a black powder musket discharges that is enough to blind the user.\n\nNot only did they add that. They added a conefire system. Now you may think that conefire means weapon or bullet spread... but no... it doesn't. Conefire is this stupid massive RNG weapon sway, that makes it look like your character's arm is made out of jello... where your character is constantly just moving his arms around in a large drunk wide random circular motion that prevents you from ever getting an accurate precise shot.\n\nSo this game went from a good skill based FPS game, to a drunk blind pray and spray RNG simulator all in one update.\n\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough... The game has extremely poor lighting and sun glare effect. Not to mention black hole shadows.\n\nWhere the majority of the game's graphics has this dark grey filter over it which Reto said they added because of \"Pixel Hunters\", where people use to be able to see enemy soldiers so far off to the distance...  like 200 meters away where they appeared to be only a few pixels, and still managed to spot and kill them. So after adding this terrible grey soup filter to the game... most players a lot of times can't even see enemy soldiers at 10 or 20 meters in front of them.\n\nThen add that on with the black hole shadows... where entire bright green, or whitish grey tanks can become almost invisible in plain sight when sitting in the shadows.\n\nThen lets not forget the sun glare... the sun glare is unnaturally bright, and is static. It doesn't dynamically change intensity or shape at different viewing angles. Even when going into a shady spot where the sun isn't shinning on your character, you still get sun glare no matter what. Even if you're in a building with solid walls where the sun doesn't shine. The only time the sun glare goes away is if you have the sun at your back at an  angle of somewhere between 175 to 185 degree .\n\nAlso this game for the past entire year that I have been playing, they still hasn't fixed the firing sound and animation bug. Where most of shots fired by someone else makes no sound at all and has no muzzle flash. This is extremely detrimental bug to have in an FPS game because it is literally the difference between life and death. Where someone can be standing literally 2 meters away from you, trying to shoot you in the back, and you simply won't hear at all. They might shoot 20 rounds at you before you even hear the first shot sound. Or a magically invisible enemy tank sitting in the shadows 10 meters right in front of you can be shooting its cannon, and you will never even know its there.\n\nSo in short why do I not recommend this game? Because the developers at Reto do not have any idea how to balance the game. They use the most bizarre illogical unrefined hack slashed methods to balance the game, by simply removing basic game mechanic functionality, trying to blind players in every way possible, dumbing down the gunplay mechanics to the point where your aiming ability doesn't matter at all since whether you hit or not due to the fact that your soldier holds his gun as if he is drunk and has jello for arms and its pure RNG base.\n\nThis game has a lot more problems than just what I mentioned in this review, but this is the stuff that you will encounter first thing off when you start playing the game as an infantryman.\n\nAlso if you're considering becoming a tanker in this game... just remember, the higher the tier the tank is, the more expensive it is, the more easier it is to be killed, and the more inaccurate it's coaxial machine gun is. Yeah you read that right... the more expensive and better armored a tank is... the more it sucks and easier to be killed in. Because the bigger and more armored your tank is, the slower it moves, which just makes it easier for infantrymen with sticky grenades (hand held anti-tank nukes) to run up to you and instantly vaporize you as if you're sitting in a aluminium foil toy car.", "timestamp_created": 1460981320, "timestamp_updated": 1461405249, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 193, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767184197902679443", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "45218913": {"recommendationid": "45218913", "author": {"steamid": "76561198018894183", "num_games_owned": 202, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 451464, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 13329, "last_played": 1551876674}, "language": "english", "review": "This game used to have potential.

As a result the game is no longer fun for the main class in the game - infantry. This was once an awesome combined arms game. Now it's becoming a poor rip-off to world of tankers.\n\nMost of all it's just another sign that the developers just do not have a damn clue where to take this game. The last few years have seen update after update that made the game objectively worse, breaking 2 new things for every single thing that was fixed. Warnings and feedback are continuously ignored while new broken updates are released. As a result most veterans players with thousands of hours - and most infantry players, have already left the game. At this point what remains in the game is only nostalgic players hoping for better times in a game that is no longer as fun as it once was, and many noob tanks hoping to HE spam poor new players into oblivion. \n\nIf you aspire to become someone's cannonfodder, this game is for you.

I tried, I played it for a while and I might continue to play it (in a more limited way), but honestly I think I'm done.\n\nThere are a few technical problems with the game:\nPerformance of the game varies highly between updates. I got anything from sustained 60 fps (with vsync on) at high quality setting to 20-25 on the lowest quality.\nWeird lag issues. Game freezes momentarily on certain occasions, sometimes at crucial events, eg. just before being killed. This is not related to CPU or memory nor GFX card. I doubt it's network related. If it is, it's server side.\n\nThe game also feels a bit unbalanced. If enemy has air superiority, you're doomed. As ground unit there's not a lot you can do. This brings me to the next frustrating fact: you have several characters each has several weapons. You cannot swap [strike]characters or[/strike] weapons during a match. You have to leave the match, leave the squad and then you can swap weapons.\n\n[i]EDIT: apparently you can swap characters if you have more than one of the same class. Thanks to RooZ for bringing this up. I haven't tested it, though. Swapping for a different class is possible if the squad has proper slots[/i]\n\nThere's a lot of griding as many have said. Personally I don't mind griding per se. What  I do mind is having to play for extended amount of time at a severe disadvantage. So either you pay money to upgrade fast or you are basically working for Reto as unpaid cannon fodder for their paying customers. In some games if you're good you may get a fighting chance. But not here. As infantry - yes. As tank crewman, not really. You will be put against superior tanks that you cannot harm with your puny cannon. And when you die you'll have to wait before spawning again and then walk or drive for a while to get to the action. There's a lot of waiting and walking in this game. I guess that makes it a more realistic military simulation. ;)\n\nThe grind is the price of a free game you say. Fair enough. However this game also suffers from the same problems as any other FPS, free or not. The lack of teamplay. When I first started playing H&G I saw how team actions (capturing) actually gives you significantly more score points compared to just killing an enemy. I said \"wonderful, they found a way to make people actually do objectives\". Sadly I was mistaken. Points schmoints. There are still very few people who will actively engage in coordinated cooperative gameplay. You'll get a circle of campers just outside capture zone. People will use resources without considering they're limited and waste them. Tank drivers will not rotate tanks so that support gunners may engage targets. Vehicles with MGs are never parked with their guns facing enemy positions. A fair amount will not follow common sense regarding objective selection and some will even roam aimlessly around the map.\n\nI'd gladly pay money for a game with a nice teamplay-oriented community but this one isn't it.\n\nSo, should you play this free game? After all I said I might continue. If you do, stick to infantry, most vestatile, easiest to survive. Get a car or a motorbike to get from spawn area to the action. If you go for any other class, expect a lot more grinding and consider that your leveling strategy and point investment may be subverted by game designers at any point.", "timestamp_created": 1488246884, "timestamp_updated": 1488728979, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 203, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.782267987728118896", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 26256, "total_negative": 17427, "total_reviews": 43683}}
