This was the game I liked to start up whenever I had free time or wanted to play with my friends.\n\nThe first few things I loved about the game was its hybrid of tactical and first-person shooter. Ubisoft had published their first triple-A title that attracted millions of players in a fast-paced catalog of gamemodes. Multiplayer had three simple options; Casual, Ranked, and Terrorist Hunt. Casual was a simpler and overall quicker version of Ranked which paired 5 players against another 5 in a randomly selected map and gamemode. The three were as follows; rescuing the hostage, planting or defending the bomb, and securing the biohazard.\n\nRoom for error was slim and firefights would be relatively short. Players were not bullet-sponges, leaving a small window of opportunity to retaliate if they are caught in a bad position. These are some of the elements that made the game suspenseful and give people just as much power as they were vulnerable. At a previous year, I [b]would've[/b] said this game would be [b]perfect for players[/b] who like a [b]touch of realism[/b] in a game they can quickly start up.\n\nHowever, at all points in Rainbow Six Siege's lifespan, there always had to be problems that could've been fixed. Except they were not. Let's look at the first year for example, [i]R6S[/i] vets I summon you. Remember how annoying it was to get into a ranked match because you would constantly get a connection error? How difficult was it for you to play with a person from Europe when you lived in the United States, or even with people in a different state? The menu was always buggy, and so were the matches. You had to see what [b]NAT type[/b] you had, because if you were given the wrong one, you couldn't host a lobby for your friends.\n\nI am not a game developer, and I don't pretend to be. However, we are talking of Ubisoft, a company that has a solid reputation of releasing games that were periodically receiving backlash. While they have deviated from the original Rainbow Six Siege series, they certainly had the great idea of a game with specialized operators and portrayed it correctly. But, in essence, for the longest time, they have been allowing people to play an [b]undeveloped game[/b]. If you disagree with me, remember that Rank used to be called \"Ranked BETA\". I am willing to bet they've done this for the longest time to avoid liability for a broken system.\n\nThis brings me to the community. I've only played Ranked for a few times in the past and was scared away from it. In [b]nearly every single match[/b], I was greeted with players that were either toxic, greifer, or cheater. From that point on, after [b]I[/b] got temp banned for retaliating on a team killer, I only dedicated myself to playing Casual and Terrorist hunt. [i]So if you were looking for a more in-depth review on Competitive, sorry. =([/i]\n\nUbisoft's response to the game-breaking bugs and huge annoyances for the community was [b]Operation Health[/b]. To see Ubisoft improve their game, was a highly plausible thing and I appreciated their show of care to the game. The major problems we had in Year one were almost completely gone. But here's the catch; they took forever. They would cancel their release of a Polish map and delay an operator, due to their slowness of repairing their issues. To this day, I ask what took them so long. I was really bummed out. I wanted to see an Eastern-Europe map. \"We already have Skyscraper. Why do we need another map in Asia? It's not even good\", I remember saying when Theme Park came out. To make things worse, then comes what I call the [b]Social Justice Siege[/b] update.\n\nI am going to ignore the microtransactions we have in this game. I will ignore the season passes Ubisoft sells to their customers for early access to characters they plan to release. At this point, in a triple-A game, these types of Pay2Cool are to be expected. My biggest problem with Rainbow Six Siege is their team's attitude to controlling the toxicity. The implementation of their chat filter was a very stupid decision for a rated-M game. Their reasoning for this was to ensure their player base was only behaving positively.\n\nThese filters banned people for use that were deemed by their automated system as, [url=https://rainbow6.ubisoft.com/siege/en-us/news/152-321200-16/dev-blog-toxicity]\"[i]illegal, dangerous, threatening, abusive, obscene, vulgar, defamatory, hateful, racist, sexist, ethically offensive or constituting harassment[/i]\"[/url], whatever this means. [b]-> ethically[/b]\nTheir system was not only ineffective in eliminating the toxicity problem but was also flawed. They refused to accept the harshness of their automated systems (banning people who answered everyday questions with \"I am Paki\" or \"I live in Niger\") and, not only that, they demonstrated toxic developer behavior themselves in Twitter posts. Seriously? [i]Good[/i] or [i]Working as intended[/i]?\n\nWasn't Tom Clancy okay with using phrases like \"sand-nigger\" and \"klukker\" in his novels? Correct me if I am wrong, it seems kind of ironic to suddenly have their chats be monitored like [b]Club Penguin[/b]. And on top of that, if they are so uptight about toxicity, why have an operator that does nothing but scream insults? Clash with a shield that shocks people like Twitch, only they can be hidden behind a shield while it happens and recharge at their leisure. So, we're just going to forget about the nerfs to Twitch, Bandit, and Jager?\n\nThen they force players to have 2FA enabled for the ranked matches. Then, they alter the maps. Now, they will be changing their content to allow people in China to play the same game, instead of having to resort to separate versions. While I am not against this because it is China, I am against censoring the iconic things about the game simply because they are banned from viewing from a country. If we even tried to make a game legal in all sorts for all countries, there would be no such thing as Rainbow Six Siege, and that's what the Ubisoft Devs are willing to do. I've stopped playing it and removed it from my favorite list of games to say \"no, thank you\".\n\nI was hoping for another instance of [b]Operation Chimera[/b] to be released for players. While zombies aren't all that realistic, the whole gamemode was actually decent and fun. I got tired of doing the same thing in each casual match. Terrorist hunt was pretty fun, but that too got boring. Sadly, I doubt they will ever bring that back.\n\nSo, to sum this up, there are a couple of things that I did not enjoy about Rainbow Six Siege. I had my fun while the game was taking their steps in the right direction, but then came their downfall. I don't regret buying that game, I really don't. But do I recommend buying the game now in its current state? Not at all. For people who favor more realism, there are certainly bigger alternatives to look forward to. FPS players? Sorry... I am at a loss, but be optimistic.

I got dyslexia so sorry for any of the grammar mistakes that there WILL be in this\n\nI would recommend this game to anyone who like tactical FPS's, the game is really fun to play alone and with friends (better with friends tho). The game itself does have a big variens of bugs and glitches sadly, some of them can be a bit game breaking. But the devs are working hard on fixing the game, but they priorite balacinging the game over fixing it. Since the game itself is not so broken you can't play it and desprice the amount of bugs and glitches. It's still really fun to play, plus it brings something different to the tact shooter games, something I really like. \n\nThe game do have many pros and cons\n\nPros: \n\n- Can be played for many hours and it never feels repetitive! (Which is many biggest issue with many games. I get bored cause I feel like I am doing the same thing over and over again, yet I got 1660+ hours on record as I make this review. My most played game ever)\n\n- Fun to play with your friends, both casual and ranked. \n\n- You can play the way you like more or less, carefull, fast, tactical or braindead. Some things work better than others no doubt. But thats where casule come it. Braindead play and just have fun!\n\n- A lot of weapons gadgets and ops (Operator) and more will come with time!!!\n\n- The game is rather cheap now, if you buy the cheapest version! (But definitely worth getting ultimate!)\n\n- There are microtransactions in this game (Which can be a con) But they are ONLY for cosmetics! You can buy ops with real money too. But its not worth it and you can obtain them with time! It seems like a big grind if you are new. But it's not so bad! But you can't buy something that makes you stronger or faster, or something dumb like that\n\n- Good game to show off your shooting skills! And improve too if you want to be a better shot! \n\n- New ops and maps every 3 months!\n\n- Rank system really lets you know how close you are too ranking up or deranking!\n\nCons: \n\n- The game is broken in many ways and it can be REALLY annoying sometimes\n\n- Hitreg (Ubisoft) Whats a hitreg? You get the idea right? Its dumb sometimes. Works mostly but sometimes it's just like you shoot blanks out of your gun\n\n- A lot of grinding of you don't buy ultimat and brutal environment for newcomers. (But the next update coming here march 2019 will give newcomers a mode just for them! So now is really the time to get Siege!)\n\n- Really toxic and I mean REALLY toxic community and salty people. It makes some leave and I don't blame them\n\n- Smokes and flashes aren't really made useful enough so the utility play in the game isn't so big and important apart from op gadgets. \n\n- Can take some time to really get use to how different this game is compared to most tac shooters- \n\n- Usually when new ops are added to the game, they start of kinda op. So new seasons can be a pain for non season pass owners. \n\n\n- Ranked system is kind of weird. You start of with getting just as much elo as you lose when you win/lose. But if you play a lot on that season you get less and less elo when you win. But loses less when you lose too. But at some point you lose more then you gain\n\nThat about covers it!

Like the Blitz glitch and the Doc glitch.\n>It makes you toxic without any control, poor performing teammates if you play with ANY randoms at all. The only way to have fun is to play as a 5 or play in Plat or Diamond as people know how to carry their own weight.\n>Cheaters everywhere as it can take 20 mins to set up a new account from a Russian website and install cheats.(not as bad as CS)\n>Game is mostly about running and gunning since 2018 and has no aspect of a tactical shooter.\n>Teamkilling and leavers in most games, leaving you only in the lurch and losing the game no matter how well you played.\n>Operator changes every new season, leading to a lack of consistency and still very poor balance.\n>The Ranked Elo points are awarded unfairly, although this is more of an opinion, If you get carried with 0 kills and 9 deaths, you earn roughly the same amount of points with someone who has 20+ kills. And Visa Versa If you carry your arse off with +20 kills and lose 4-5, you lose the full amount like everyone else. Although it is a team game, This is stupid as many just throw games with no intention of winning.\n>DLC Operators that are OP asf in the first month of their release and then they get nerfed into oblivion as soon as everyone buys them with R6 Credits. \n>COMPLETE censorship, no swearing in an 18 game? no opinions or saying \"Retard\" when you're talking about a game mechanic or joking around. This is the worst possible tactic to prevent toxicity as now you can only report for toxicity and not for cheaters?!

Rainbow Six Siege is not one of those shooters where you can join a match and dominate easily. For newbies the game can feel impossible to grasp because in Siege you need to be aware of your surroundings all the time and use teamwork to stay alive as you die very quickly compared to those arcade shooters. \n\nNow I've played a lot of shooters in my time but the shooters I play are mainly arcade shooters like Battlefield, which has a much lower skill ceiling and doesn't require too much time to get good at. The arcade shooters I played also felt much more casual, with the ability for downed players to respawn after death something that doesn't happen in Siege. I decided that I would give the game a try, as I enjoyed Ubisoft's AC series and generally liked their games.\n\nWhen I joined my first game I was amazed at how awesome the performance felt. I was able to basically max out the game and get 60+ fps, something quite uncommon with Ubi ports. Right off the top Rainbow Six Siege uses an \"Operator\" system which is basically reminiscent of a class system and it allows you to pick different operators to use. Each operator will have their own weapons and special skills and you unlock more as you continue playing. Each operator feels unique in it's own sense and can bring something different to the table. I'd recommend if you're starting out that you play around with the operators until you get a better feel for them.\n\nThe gunplay in Siege feels very nice and fluid, guns sound and feel awesome and will also instant kill you if fired at the head. Gameplay feels very fast paced, something very akin to Counter Strike and the modes are also very similar. Casual Modes include Hostage Rescue, Area Secure and a few others. There is also a Ranked Match that can be unlock after a certain number of wins in casual.\n\nTo conclude, Rainbow Six Siege is a fun game whucg you can't expect to just rush in and do well compared to other shooters. The game requires dedication and patience in order for one to master the game. I bought this game on sale for $16.74 NZD and I would highly recommend it at this price as you will not regret it.\n\nVerdict 8/10.", "timestamp_created": 1549537427, "timestamp_updated": 1549537668, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517147660255432129", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48884297": {"recommendationid": "48884297", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170739109", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 8854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1551577613}, "language": "english", "review": "gay", "timestamp_created": 1549748851, "timestamp_updated": 1549748851, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536144614219665527", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48804003": {"recommendationid": "48804003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198422129649", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11021, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1213, "last_played": 1551737503}, "language": "english", "review": "This game used to be good but somethings just crash the game and i hate that about the game this game if its fixed isn't bad but right now the game is absolute shit.", "timestamp_created": 1549473795, "timestamp_updated": 1549473795, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527607321739196777", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48814314": {"recommendationid": "48814314", "author": {"steamid": "76561198039338420", "num_games_owned": 185, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 49965, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1155, "last_played": 1551844153}, "language": "english", "review": "What a trash game.

As someone who sank several thousand hours each into Battlefield series and CoD, I've played super close quarters maps, massively wide open maps, destructible environments, tactical gear, you name it and I was sure I knew how to handle it. I wasn't entirely wrong, at least.\n\nMore than anything else when starting R6S, I would have to recommend that you learn proper positioning. Exposing even just a knee from behind cover or around a doorway can lead to unexpected death. With most walls, floors, ceilings, and furniture being destructible, penetrable, or even just permeable, you should definitely learn where you are safe and where you are not. This, of course, works both ways; if you know you can't use the couches in the Consulate for reliable cover, you'll be much more likely to catch an enemy off guard when they haven't learned that lesson yet.\n\nOn the topic of map size, the majority of maps, as of this review, do not have more than one or two particular spots where truly long-range firefights can occur, and in fact unless you are VERY confident in your reaction time they are a nightmare for the attacking team. A good spawn-peek (which happens far more than one might hope) can halve the attacking team's force in the first 30 seconds of a round with very little chance to retaliate. The strongest optics for any weapon in the game (with the exception of Glaz's OTs-03 rifle) are the ACOG sights, so the more realistically close-in environments make sense.\n\nThe game 100% earned the \"Better With Friends\" award, as playing random pickup groups can be both frustrating in queue time, and in dealing with (at least) a solid 1/3 of the community being toxic enough to qualify as a meme. If you are not playing in a preformed group consistently, you WILL experience verbal harassment, being team-killed with or without reason, unexpectedly vote-kicked (again with or without reason), and griefing. The only options you have are to report or leave the match and hope for better next game.\n\nWith all that being said, you will still find that most matches aren't as bad as that (though I have heard it gets worse above gold ranking). There are also non-pvp game modes that can give you a chance to at least learn the basics of each operator as you unlock them, and just getting a starting point of that level can make a world of difference. Another detail not to overlook is the built-in voice chat, as communication between teammates WILL make a difference overall.\n\nI do certainly recommend the game, and would encourage anyone with an interest to at least try the standard edition. You can always upgrade later or buy the operators you're interested in down the line. I've only got about 125 hours of play but I've already unlocked 6 additional operators; maybe not the fastest progression, but free is free, and you do get a bonus to your in-game currency rewards when playing in a group.", "timestamp_created": 1550515820, "timestamp_updated": 1550515820, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49047568": {"recommendationid": "49047568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198398897302", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 330, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 48, "last_played": 1550889431}, "language": "english", "review": "This fps is unique from others but good.

Tactical with close quarters combat is definitely hard to master, as of now, I'm at 350+ hours and still learning. But it is a very rewarding game. Each operator has a unique play style, with their speed/armour, weapons and gadget, which allows for a different experience every time. The numerous maps also allow for different approach on offence and defence. Another thing that i appreciate about Rainbow Six Siege is that, despite this game being released in 2015, it is still being developed, especially with Y4 coming with numerous fixes on items and toxicity within the community. For anybody thinking it will get boring at one point, it really doesn't as this game and the enemies are very unpredictable and there are infinite strats and play styles which will allow for a lot of fun experimenting the game.\n\nI do have to say that, the players are not that welcoming to new players, or even players in general. Ubisoft did address this, creating a Newcommer playlist, allowing new players to learn and get better at the game. Some of the operators, even after all this time are still not fully balanced which, sometimes can really get on someones nerves, but, it is slowly being worked on.\n\nOverall, I love this game and i cannot wait to see how it will be developed further.\n\n4.9 / 5\n\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1550878324, "timestamp_updated": 1550878324, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.509803950786590576", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49145320": {"recommendationid": "49145320", "author": {"steamid": "76561198141235706", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 9480, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6418, "last_played": 1551818426}, "language": "english", "review": "(y)", "timestamp_created": 1550786722, "timestamp_updated": 1550786722, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49094244": {"recommendationid": "49094244", "author": {"steamid": "76561198236505360", "num_games_owned": 103, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 6634, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 177, "last_played": 1551466379}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want a short and honest review about Rainbow Six Siege, it's an amazing tactical first person shooter, with both interesting game play and characters that make up Team Rainbow.

Suffice to say, I'm impressed. The amount of support the devs gave it is astounding, especially compounded with the fact that the game itself had a somewhat botched release, which really shows Ubisoft's commitment on doing it right by not dropping it instantly. For perspective, this game came out on Dec 2015; three years later, and I never waited more than a minute for the matchmaking. \n\nThe game is growing and is now bigger than ever. Its community is lively and ripe with discussions, and although it can and does have toxicity problems like all PVP titles, it's still far cry from the likes of which you can find on, say, CSGO and/or DotA2, at least in my limited experience. This is a good thing, needless to say.\n\nJust recently Ubisoft both gave a glimpse of the support this game will get in the next ten years and declined to ride the battle royale wave, both are statements of which I found really refreshing.

People complain about the community, and I agree that there is toxic people, but I will almost always find one person who is fun, and or bearable to play with. It took 50 hours to understand the basic game play mechanics, another 50 to somewhat learn the maps, and another 100 hours to feel as if i'm. I am no where close good as I usually place between gold 4 and gold 3, but I find casual to be far more fun than ranked. My only problems in this game lie in the frustration I get when i am spawn peeked, or killed at the very beginning of the round, it happens quite often, and the player is punished for any minor mistake, but that frustration only makes getting 3-4 kills in a round that much more satisfying.

The game had a mega sale and I thought it is my time to buy it. I bought the standard edition and I instantly started downloading it. I was so excited to finally get playing. After about 6 hours of downloading it was finally done! I got on and boom, I had no renown, no defenders nor offensive only recruit. This was very confusing and my friends wonder why this happened. I'm beyond mad about this because I can't join a single game without being kicked for being a recruit. If I wasn't kicked, people would just shoot me and I never got a chance to play. I understand this community is kinda salty but so are all the other multiplayer games. This kicking and team killing process happens every time I would join a new game. I soon had to get my friends to join so they could protect me and decline the kick. I'm so confused, I might have gotten the wrong version I'm not sure.

I preordered the game way back in ye olden days, and participated in the closed and open betas. I have every operator currently available (assuming the Aussie ops aren't out yet) and let me tell you, this game is a blast. No pun intended.\n\nTake the following paragraph with a grain of salt, because I argue in favor of operators seen as weak (like Capitao) and my favorite map, Yacht, was removed for about a year - give or take - because it was seen as unbalanced. Anyway, as far as I'm concerned, there are no operators that are excruciatingly unbalanced one way or another. Sure, there are obvious ones where their ability is a must-have (Rook, Thermite/Hibana/Maverick) or their weapons are so good they get picked because of that - such as the beautiful German M870 and the glorious Russian SASG-12 auto-shotty - but I rarely have an issue with an operator. Sometimes, when they are introduced or buffed, they can get a little stupid-good like Blitz when they accidentally made him speed racer and ruled the game for a week or two, but eventually, they end up fairly balanced. The maps are generally pretty good. There are a few outliers, like Bartlett U. which can rot in terrorist hunt, but surprisingly their earlier maps tend to be better, or at least more loved.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing. And it's even better with friends. Not only because communication is very powerful, but because of the antics you'll get up to and the insane tactics you'll use as a group. In one of my Discord servers of friends and friends of friends we once got a 5v5 private game together and whoo boy it was hectic and hilarious.\n\nOh yeah, protip: there's a profanity filter.

So I picked it up on launch. Make no mistake though, Siege was horrible back then. Around say March 2016 (picked it up again when black ice got out) I picked it back up again, after hearing it has improved. So I grinded through and found some semblance of skill after playing and watching Youtube ( cough* Serenity and his tutorials, later that iceycat).\n\nSo I found a clan, it wasn't as such originally but we played pretty well together so we formed one.\n2016. Best year of my (gaming) life, honestly. I thought \"hey this game is going to surpass CS GO one day' and at the same time I hoped that would not happen so that it wouldn't \"trend\". (Personally I felt that people buying games just because they are popular and not because of what it is is annoying. And it definitely shows in Siege, will be explained later)\n\nSo you might as what do I love so much about this game and why did drop it?\nTo start off. Siege really did what no other FPS could do.\nIn Siege, you could do well without having great aim. No I am not talking about great as in shroud but more of those clips where people do very hard flicks, in general.\nWhy? Because here is the kicker and what I found most people who buy this game do not realize.\n\nIn order of importance:  Information, Communication, Teamwork, Aim.\nVery generic terms, but let me explain. I do want to state that game sense is a must have for ANY game so it is not stated.\n\n\n-------------------------INFORMATION----------------------\nWhat do I mean by information? Knowledge of what is going on in the game, and outside itself. (Will focus more on in)\nSee in any game it is obvious you need to know what x thing can do etc etc, so I would not elaborate on that.\nThough one point i want to make there is strats, or strategies. Which do also count as out-of-game information.\nNow on to the main point. So what do I mean? Information on where the enemy spawns. Information on what operators the enemy has. Information on where the enemy is and so on.\nNow this is such a crucial aspect of Siege is due to Siege's game play and map design / structure.\nIn Siege there would be two teams, with swapping roles per round. \nA team of attackers and a team of defenders.\n\nThe defenders would normally start in a compound, (think like an ACTUAL 4 level building) which would be the main area of action. Attackers would then choose their path of entry from the outside. During the preparation phase the attackers would be in control of drones (See? Information.) that could spot where the objective is, act as a mobile camera and see what strat the other team is running. Defenders would make kill holes, set up traps and reinforce walls. They would assume either an anchor role where they 'camp' in a spot or a roamer role where they well, roam around the map for attackers to kill.\n\nLets say round starts, 5:00 (can't remember the start time, should be five minutes). \nAt this point, what information you have, could dictate what you do. For example, lets say we are playing attackers.\nDo I know where the objective is?\nIf No: Sweep floor by floor, you can't waste any more time.\nIf yes: How do you plan to enter?\n\nYour plan of entry would be largely dependent on how the defenders manipulated the map, your team's operators and your enemy team's operators.\nTo give a very simple example, if they had a pulse surely you wouldn't just walk in normally.                    \n\nAnd for the defenders they would normally take a look at the cameras to see where the attacker spawn.\n(Assuming they want a spawn kill)\nDid they see my broken window?\nIf Yes can I run fast enough to another spot to get a kill?\nIf No would I get killed?\n\nThe match progresses and you are playing as a roamer, you checked the cameras and see that there is an enemy on the other end of the building, but not too far away from you.\nSo what do you do?\nThat would depend on the information you have.\nIs there anyone near him?\nCan I kill him from a safe distance?\nHOW do I get to him? (Safest route, any escape routes?)\n\nAll these micro and macro decisions, have to be made with information. \nWith information, you don't need to have great aim. You just need to hold the right angle in the right place.\n\nAs such, anything that can give you information is a great help and very important. ( I like playing valkyrie for this reason, many ways to set up her camera)\nThis would move on to my next point.\n\n-----------------------Communication---------------------\nLets switch roles, you are now the anchor. (to be fair most of the camera checking work is done by the anchor at the start, assuming the anchor doesn't hold angles where the enemies will breach at the start)\nYou check cams, you are on first floor, you see an enemy by himself on the other side of the map. \nHowever as the anchor you cannot move. You do know your roamer is there, but on the second floor.\nSo you tell him by either using comms or a ping.\nYou tell him exactly what you see and what the enemy is doing. (Giving him INFORMATION)\nYour roamer now knows the situation and will access it accordingly, as stated above. (most likely going for the kill)\n\nHowever, because you gave such accurate information, not only did your team get the kill, your roamer is safe.\nHow? You told him there is someone else guarding the stairs. So instead of going down, he killed the enemy through the (opened) hatch.\nSurely you don't need to have great aim to kill a slow moving target that isn't even aware of your presence do you? \nSee where I am getting at?\nThis also transitions into my next point.\n\n---------------------------Teamwork-----------------------\nCommunication multiplied.\nI can give a really easy example, you can ask anyone out there, they wouldn't disagree.\nBecause I am/was in a clan, some things would be done without even talking to each other. We all knew what strats we were going to run on certain maps. We were able to complement each other's strength and whatever information we had.\n\nWhat I mean by strats could be as simple to defender preparation to something such as sequenced actions for the attackers. (Kill hole, breach, flash, kill from above, etc etc) Things that you really need to practice together to get it right.\nCoordinated attacks, a tactical approach.\n\nSo my last section, which would also include my semi-rant.\n\n----------------------Aim------------------------\nif you cannot tell, from what I have discussed, knowing what to do is the most important in siege.\nPersonally, you only really rely on your aim if something else happens. \nElse, you should be droning in to rooms first. If not, lean and sweep the room. (If you are an attacker / roamer that is).\n\nThe maps on siege are so easy to aim. The floors are so even, you could easily guess where heads would be after a few hours playing. Rarely you had to aim in odd angles such as a diagonal XYZ. \nThis would lead to my \"rant\" section. And why I feel this shouldn't have been 'trended'.\n\nMost people buy this game, most likely because of one or more of the following reasons:\nWow, many people play, must be good. I buy.\nWow, operator have sk1llz. I buy.\nWow, one bullet to head, no matter the gun. Die. I buy.\n\nThey don't realize the beauty of this well constructed and put together game.\nIn Siege, none of that ultra glory shit matters. Only the win.\nYou can very easily get 3 kills and still lose due to poor communication.\n\nI hope after reading this review, you will not become one of them. \nRather, buy and appreciate this game for what it is.\n\nSo what should stop you from buying the game? The hitboxes and your commitment.\n(As it is such a tough game)", "timestamp_created": 1550608666, "timestamp_updated": 1550611646, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.506732821464538574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49080712": {"recommendationid": "49080712", "author": {"steamid": "76561198396004062", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 29398, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1072, "last_played": 1551824510}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1550527633, "timestamp_updated": 1550527633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519544005393981934", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48909063": {"recommendationid": "48909063", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183994615", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 6830, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546958482}, "language": "english", "review": "its only about who will shot first", "timestamp_created": 1549825064, "timestamp_updated": 1549825064, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.501470625400543213", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48906679": {"recommendationid": "48906679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198043965815", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 5601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549823133}, "language": "english", "review": "A shitty unbalanced trash.

Makes me think that Ubisoft doesn't permanently fixes this issue because if a hacker gets banned, Hacker buys a new account, because the reality is that these hackers are getting paid by people for boosting them into higher ranks. 2 factor authentication didnt solve anything either. I've played considerable number of hours (1,700 plus hours) and i always play rank. After the ban wave last time i thought this will be it, the new siege ranked without hackers.

Siege is filled with a variety of players ranging from sweaty try hards to low life degenerates. This is easily one of the most toxic player communities I have ever been apart of. However, the player base is not at fault for the toxicity of this game. It is very much Ubisoft's fault for this game becoming the cesspit of toxicity that it is. For the following reason, the broken game frustrates many players. Ranging from broken hit boxes, unbalanced operators, unbalanced maps, and my personal favorite, glitches that fly me to the bottom of the map. This frustration due to the broken game that is Rainbow Six Siege, causes much of the player base to resort in other ways to find fun in this game. Easily some of the most common are teamkilling, insta kicking players, destroying friendly equipment, and the toxic chat. Ubisoft is unfortunately too focused on attempting to keep their aging players as well as trying to squeeze as much money as possible out of the game.

It's not even close. This is an incredibly difficult game for an FPS, but the payoff is well worth it. At about 100-150 hours of play I felt like I generally understood all the maps, the tactics and meta for each, and the play mechanics; at about that point it starts to become an FPS that makes all others obsolete. I completely understand that the grind time is a huge barrier to entry, so here are some suggestions to speed it up:\n1. Study the maps as much as possible and know the layout, player spawn locations, objective spawn locations, and the locations of destructible surfaces. Obviously this will come with experience, but you'll get a massive head start by memorizing this early.\n2. Change your expectations; this is not anything like CoD or Battlefield. You might not get a kill for the first 10 hours of play. You might not have a positive KDR for 50 hours. You might not get MVP until 100. All of this is fine, because this is a **hard** shooter. Expect that you're going to perform awfully for a while, but that it's going to feel really, really, really good when you start hitting your milestones.\n3. This is a teamwork-based game. Use a microphone if at all possible, or at least type in chat, and communicate with your team. If you're dead, watch cameras and call out positions to your team. This also helps you learn the names of the rooms and gets you accustomed to the routes players will typically take.\n4. Pick operators you actually like playing. Don't just follow online guides' suggestions on which operators to unlock--read about and watch footage of operators and pick the ones you're excited about. Just want to play the starters? That's totally fine, Thatcher and Jager are two of my absolute favorites. If you stick to ones you enjoy, you'll enjoy the game that much more.\n\nOn the flip side, the community is not great. There are a lot of toxic players who can't handle loss, have no patience for new players, or just want to make someone's day suck. Don't let them get to you and use the voice/text chat mute features as much as you need. If they're getting really out of hand then just report them.\nThe Renown system (the currency you buy operators with) accrues really slowly, so if you're okay with in-game purchases, buying some Renown to get some operators more quickly might help. Personally, I think forcing myself to play my new operators until I'm able to unlock a new one helps me get proficient all my unlocked ones, but that's my opinion.\nThe ranked system isn't perfect, but it's a cool way to take the experience up a notch when you get pretty good at the game. Don't stress out about it too much, plenty of players only play casual.\n\nThis really is a fantastic game when you put the time into it, and it's up to you if that's an investment you want to make. As long as you understand that it can be a grueling process in the beginning, potentially 100 hours until you're proficient, and that the community can be exhausting, I say take the leap.", "timestamp_created": 1550364269, "timestamp_updated": 1550364269, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.454545468091964722", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48982938": {"recommendationid": "48982938", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001605396", "num_games_owned": 18, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6327, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550098696}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is a HEADACHE...

This game has a mountain of problems that I can't believe most players either ignore or think that there fine, cause they are definitely not fine.\n\nPROS\n+ Its a really good gameplay style and concept that makes it stand out from other FPS games(COD, Battlefield, CSGO, Overwatch)\nTHATS IT, THERE ISN'T ANYTHING ELSE GOOD ABOUT THIS GAME.\n\nCONS\n- There is only ONE game mode, I don't care what they tell you, \"but there's actually three(Causal, Ranked,Terrorist Hunt)\". NO there isn't cause its just the same exact mode with the ONLY difference being either a longer game or waves of CPUs to kill with the same objectives as the other two modes.\n- Operators all feel the exact same and with having only a single unique gadget means that you wont find to that one character to play, along with the fact that Ubisoft treats this game like its a fighting game. ITS NOT, at this point half of the game's Operators are blocked by a paywall of DLC passes and separate payments that makes it feel as if your not getting the full game but a demo, and just like a fighting game the amount of time it takes to get a single operator is just not worth the time at all.\n- Reward and Progression system are complete and utter garbage. There are no rewards for leveling up so why even have a leveling system and the loot box system is just like i have NO WORDS for it, as you win matches instead of leveling up to get a free loot box or getting in-game currency at a good rate, NOOO you get your fucking CHANCE of getting a loot box increased which caps out at 50%. What makes this even worse is unlike EVERY OTHER FUCKING ONLINE GAME ON THE PLANET you only get one item out of these loot boxes with CAN be a duplicate, which means you just wasted all of that time for nothing.\n-The game's currency is so badly unbalanced in its rate that if you do manage to save up you might as well get a new operator cause all of the weapon skins, operator skins and little things are blocked by a an stupidly high payroll that they almost cost the same as the operators themselves. The game's weekly challenges are just a laughing pile of garbage cause they give pretty much nothing in terms of currency.\n-Then there's the toxic as fuck community, listen I play hours and hours of Overwatch (and used to play CSGO) so I know what a toxic community looks like but Jesus Christ this community is a shit show if I've ever seen one. You can get kicked for whatever reason under the sun( slow internet, taking someone's operator, you got killed easily and early in the game) and trying to play a game on ranked(or causal) is an achievement cause ANYTHING CAN GO FUCKING WRONG because why not,( you get team-killed in seconds or have either grown ass men and little kids screaming there fucking lungs out cause you just want to know how to use a certain operator's gadget effectively. Also Ubisoft's banning system doesn't help AT ALL AND ONLY MAKES THINGS WORSE.\n\nVerdict:\nJust stay away from this game all together, do yourself a flavor and use that extra cash for something else on your wishlist cause you are gonna regret buying this piece of fucking shit game.\n\nPS: If your wondering why I still play this game after saying all of this, its because one of my friends loves this game to death so I have to play this with them, I would never play this shit show of a game solo.

Now that I have half the internet up my ass for daring to critic and view this game through a critical lenses2, let us begin.\n\nThe concept of Rainbow Six siege is an amazing idea to bring the reflex-like shooting elements of Call of Duty with the realistic tone of the likes of Rainbow Six Vegas could have made an amazing game. I say could have because this game turned into a steaming pile of shit from the broken banning system people abuse day-in and Day-out to the fact that the loot box system is a joke compared to ANY fucking game. Many people will come racing to say this game is fun and unique what with the THREE different game types you can play in Multiplayer. Slow down Ubisoft, you might blow some kids minds with this level of content.\n\nSpeaking of content, lets talk about the fact that Ubisoft literally removes content to create paywalls that you are practically forced to pay if you want certain cosmetics. \"But Ayata! You don't have to buy those items. There is no need!\" I can understand this defense but when a company removes content that was free to get from loot boxes to then shove them behind paywalls is just fucking scummy beyond believe. The fact the company then has the audacity to then get rid of certain skins all together just shows that the company doesn't care for the average consumer, they only care for the the little lackeys that spend hundreds of dollars on this mess of a game.If you pay this company money, knowing full well that the company is known to lock off content only shows you yourself don't care and choose to blindly support these shitty actions.\n\nNow that the whole micro bullshit is out of the way, let's get to the best part of the game... The GamePlay\n\nThe game-play is fine for the most part but I won't say that I enjoyed it fully do to the sheer volume of toxic players who choose to abuse mechanics in a game all because they want the win no matter what. This game is filled to the brim with opportunity but it's lost as the years go own. I've been with this game since the launch on console all the way to now and I have to say the game became shit. Going from being stealthy and being rewarded for doing so, you now get punished for being sneaky and even get banned if you play too passive all because your team-mates are a little too trigger happy. Not only that, but your own team mates can report you out of the group if they so choose! awesome right?!\n\nIf you are unlucky enough to play alone, you have a massive chance of getting kicked if:\n1. Your internet is slow\n2. You take someone's operator\n3. You piss someone off because you \"stole their kills\"\n4. You did nothing and got popped off because fuck you\nThere are tons of more reasons to ban and the fact it can be done so easily only reinforces the idea that Ubisoft doesn't give two flying fucks about this game or it's player base.\n\nNow if you ignore all this utter garbage and push through to play this game, you will be greeted with the most lack luster and depressing loot box system I have ever seen. This game implements the idea of rewarding players with the chance of getting a loot box based off of a percentage that you can increase by winning more if you don't get the loot box first go. Why is this an inherently bad thing? Simple, the chance of getting a loot box does not correlate with the possible chance of reward, or in layman's terms... the rewards are ass\n\nWhat game thinks it is okay to make loot boxes rare as all hell to get unless you binge all fucking night, only to allow ONLY ONE ITEM to come form the damn thing you spent maybe an hour or two on? This practically bends the arm of ANY person who wants to get a skin or even get a stupid charm for a gun. However, there is a way around this fucking stupid idea of a loot box system, and that is Weekly and daily challenges.\n\nTo sum those challenges up in about two words: They suck.\nThe rewards from these awesome weekly's are not worth the time and effort you have to put since the amount of renown you gain is literally chump change n the massive pool of crap you need to get one loot box, let alone any other amount. So why even add these randomly generated, poorly thought out challenges to begin with? To create the illusion that you don't have to pay money to get the things you want in this game. But that's all it is... an illusion. The whole idea of having the opportunity to get a loot box is bullshit, I mean Overwatch and Killing Floor 2 did this shit right but nobody likes to mention good games that do shit right when reviewing this game. All in all, this game... is a mess. From the broken game mechanics people abuse and then defend for some fucking reason to the horrid business practices that Ubosift likes to practice with this game. If you got extra cash in the account, avoid this game till it gets it shit together.

So weapon damage almost completely useless. Just as \"defence\" and \"speed\" stats of operatives.\n-Everyone camps, as even one bullet from crappiest weapon could be fatal.\n-Peeking mechanic enables camping even more, so prepare to be killed from frame perfect 1 pixel angle when you can't even see enemy.\n-You can't shoot on the run. From any weapon. For some reason operatives feel obligated to shake their weapon on the run instead of attempting to supress enemy fire.\n-Silencer makes shots COMPLETELY silent. Even impact with the floor is completely silent, what a powerful silencer.\n-Very bad contrast. Noticing enemy often difficult by itself, but color choice adds difficulty. Even with maxed brightness you often can't see anything quickly enough.\n-Community friendliness reminds me of DotA2. Probably nostalgia googles, but even DotA2 was better in this regard. Someone demands to play all rookies and kills/kicks everyone who chooses other heroes, someone flames because you don't know names of all operatives, someone just afks. Regular fights in public or team chat just about anything.\n\nNot to say you can't have fun. Potent weapon variety, destructible walls, interesting operative abilities and game mechanics.

I definitely do NOT mean to represent ALL Chinese players.\n\nFor the record, I am not really fond of pvp-like games but I still bought the complete version of Rainbow Six Siege. Part of the reason, as you all know, is for the green discount mark made by \u201cFatty G\u201d(Chinese nickname of Gabe Newell), for another part of the reason, is about the topic that I am going to address.\n\nFirst, we shall start with some background information about a Chinese company called Tencent. As you may already know, WeChat and QQ are two of Tencent\u2019s most famous products. (For you guys who don\u2019t, you can view them as two powerful chatting software that have already taken the place of mobile text messages. From my personal view, I\u2019d say four out of five Chinese people use WeChat and/or QQ, so that makes a billion, letting alone foreigners.) These two products bring quite a lot of convenience to Chinese people. Yet Tencent is such a huge company that it almost infiltrates into every aspect in Chinese Internet market and some of which do not receive good reputation. So, basically, video game is its most heated debating part.\n\nThere are still a lot of Chinese people, however, spending their wages in Tencent games as they curse its unfairness. Why? I think two main reasons lead to this phenomenon. The first reason, from my humble understanding, relates to Chinese social structure. The middle classes make the most part in Chinese society. While it may seem to be natural to some countries, it brings problem in China due to the large population and limited resources. Chinese people have to COMPETE with each other. At schools we compete for the access to better educations; At companies we compete for higher salaries; At governments we compete for stronger power(Time for me to shut up)\u2026As a result, winners are few, and losers makes the major. So when it comes to games, many(In case of misunderstanding I dare not to use the word \u201cmost\u201d, but I really want to) Chinese players pay everything they could to win in a game, like spending money in the Pay To Win games(which most Tencent games are based on), like cheating methods(Again I personally feel sorry for what\u2019s happening in PUBG although I barely play it and I do not Cheat). For the record I just explain the phenomenon from my personal understanding. I do not view such phenomenon as a reason to break the balance in games or to cheat.\n\nThe second reason is basically like what is happening to NBA 2K 18, it receives only less than 30% positive comments yet people still pay for it even after they\u2019ve seen the bad comments, which means a monopoly is happening here, right? Steam is like a shadow region in China, so literally, it is not a legal platform in the mainland of China. Using this convenience, Tencent gets the chance to gain the right of dealership in some famous games. For instance, Call of Duty series. We Chinese people cannot reach the access to its Steam store because of Tencent. And what is worse, Tencent itself launched a game called Call of Duty Online. And when it comes to Online, you should know that it is a game that is for free to play, but costs to win. You\u2019ve got to pay for stronger weapons. I mean, it is still OK if you pay for skins, right? But since it is a FPS competitive game, I do not think it to be reasonable to charge for weapons, it is bound to break the balance of the game. Similar things happened in Need for Speed Online: you pay for faster cars to beat other players; And Naruto Online: you pay for stronger ninjas to defeat other players. Not to mention numerous Tencent self-made games. PAY TO WIN IS EVERYWHERE.\n\nAnd now, Ubisoft China has just announced that Tencent got the dealership of R6. Chinese R6 players began to worry: They are worried about whether they will be region locked; They are worried about whether the balance of the game will be broken. It should be noted that everything is still at the early stage and what will exactly happen to R6 in China is still unknown, thus it is to some extent unfair for Ubisoft to receive so many negative comments. Yet it is important for Ubisoft to pay more attention to Chinese players since the comments are not made by a single or two, but quite a lot of gamers who really love this game and don\u2019t want it to become the next Online product of Tencent.\n\nThanks for reading this comment and sorry for my bad English.

They've also changed the prices of the operators, making them more cheaper so hooray![/b]\n\n[h1][b]This is for the people who brought the starter edition... [spoiler]like me.[/spoiler][/b][/h1]\n\nIf you brought the starter edition, your best option would be to pick 10 operators since base game operators cost 12,500 renown each.  So 5 operators each for attacking and defending and the 10 that I'm about to list are possibly your best bet to having the best experience in Rainbow Six Siege.\n\n[h1][u]For the attacking team[/u][/h1] \n[list]\n[*][b]Sledge[/b] - If you are absolutely new to the game and you don't know where to start, Sledge is one of the best options to choose from. He isn't a hard operator to play with (Considering his name, you should know why...) and the team doesn't rely too heavily on his gadget.  \n[*][b]Thermite[/b] - One of the best operators in the game because of how good his rifle is with low recoil and high damage.  His gadget is also one of the most useful in the game especially for creating a [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/oB-9j98APlM?t=1m8s]BIG FUCKING HOLE[/url][/spoiler] on reinforced walls.  Though, to create that hole, you have to make sure you stay alive, the team relies heavily on him to get into the objective but if it's jammed or electrified...\n[*][b]Thatcher[/b] -  Thatcher is your main man.  One of the biggest problems you'll face as a Thermite are Mute's and Bandit's gadgets which jam or electrify reinforced walls.  With Thatcher, all you have to do is throw your EMP grenades and no more [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/NPucxmxW5eM]FOOKIN' LASER SIGHTS.[/url][/spoiler]\n[*][b]Ash[/b] - She's one of the fastest operators in the game and literally has no hitbox.  Her gadget is breaching things from afar, pretty much a breaching grenade laucher which sticks into any surface.  Just remember that you'll be called a sweaty try hard from time to time...\n[*][b]Twitch[/b] - Now this may be a controversial pick since her drone is about to get nerf'd but her rifle is what keeps her on this list.  Her ability isn't that special, basically a drone that can't jump but can shock people and destroy their gadgets.  However, her F2, a variant of the Famas, shoots around 980 RPM and it's possibly one of the most deadliest assault rifles in the game.[/list]\n\n[h1][u]And now, for the defending team[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*][url=https://youtu.be/F-6ZkbVpTcU][b]Rook[/b][/url] - He's one of the easiest operators to play and helps the team just by dropping a pack of armor.  That's all you have to do and you get to survive one extra bullet and will mostly be put in the DBNO stage instead of death.  The only thing you have to remember is to make sure you drop armor in the beginning of the round which a lot of people forget...\n[*][b]Bandit[/b] - Bandit's gadget is pretty simple to use as long as you use it on reinforced walls since his gadget is the only one that can destroy Thermite and Hibana's charges on contact.  Also, his MP7 is known as a god tier gun, being incredibly easy to use.  [spoiler][url=https://youtu.be/hkLUOuE_-5I]Did I also mention he had to deal [b]DRUGS?[/b][/url][/spoiler]\n[*][b]Jager[/b] - Aka the ultra sweaty try hard main.   To be honest though, there is a good reason why people main this guy and that's because of how good he is.  His gagdet may not be that useful at times, having the ability to destroy any type of throwable but I like to call it wishful thinking.  Another thing to help him is that he's currently the only defender with an assault rifle so he gets to do more damage than most defenders which only carry SMGs.  \n[*][b]Smoke[/b] - He's simple but somewhat hard to use.  See an enemy trying to get in?  Block him out with gas.  That's why he's called Smoke.  He excels during the last few seconds of a round when enemies are desperately rushing in.  [spoiler][b][url=https://youtu.be/8MHk0WwrzgY]WHAT'S IN THE CANISTER?[/url][/b][/spoiler]\n[*][b]Mute[/b] - He almost works in the same way as Bandit but his gadget has a radius meaning he can block off a Thermite's breaching charges on two walls.  He also has the ability to place his jammers anywhere where as Bandit can only place his on shields, barbed wire, and reinforced walls.  He is one of the harder operators to play if you don't use him correctly so I'd recommend learning him soon.  [/list]\n\n[h1][u]Honorable Mentions[/u][/h1]\n[list]\n[*][b]Hibana[/b] - She's an attacker who serves as an alternative to Thermite.  Her gadget is a mix between Ash and Thermite, being able to shoot out 6 pellets and burn through reinforced walls.  She's a flexible operator and her ability can be amazing at times.  She's a DLC character so she will cost 25,000 renown.  [/list]\n\n[h1]So do I recommend the game?[/h1]\n\n[b]Absolutely.[/b]  Even if you buy the starter edition, all it really means is that it will take more time and patience.

The game features asymmetrical gameplay where the teams are not always balanced in their abilities. Heavy emphasis is put on procedural environmental destruction allowing players to break certain structures by planting explosives, or shooting walls to make bullet holes or even larger ones to climb through.\n \n[h1][Pros][/h1]\n+ Over 30 operators to choose from, based on real life counter terrorism units, each with their own unique weapons and gadgets.\n+ No match will be the same thanks to the diverse cast of characters which is still getting expanded by Ubisoft, even 1.5 years after the game\u2019s release.\n+ Precise procedural destruction of most of the games floors and walls resulting in a tactical shooter like no other; simply running and gunning will only get you so far\n+ Customization options for guns which also impact the way they operate. From a simple silencer to four different sights and weapon grips or fore grips, everything will change weapon behavior.\n+ Pleasing graphics that look great and don\u2019t require a monster PC to push 60 FPS or higher.\n+ A fair use of micro-transactions where you can only buy skins and operators with real money but you can also unlock them through in-game currency.\n+ You just can\u2019t buy anything that gives you an advantage over other players.\n+ Season pass owners get 1 week early access to new operators and all new operators in that year for free along with other skins and small benefits.\n+ Maps are free for everyone, it doesn\u2019t matter if you bought the season pass or not, everyone can play together.\n+ Incredible sound engine that lets you hear precise enemy movement, like them walking into glass on the floor and other surfaces, or the exact direction where the steps are coming from. This is making good use of 5.1 surround sound or just good stereo headphones.\n+ Music is fitting the game\u2019s tone very well you just don\u2019t hear much of it since it is only playing at the beginning and at the end of rounds which in turn is making you not really care for it all.\n\n[h1][Cons][/h1]\n- Lag compensation, netcode and tickrate is still broken and you sometimes die out of nowhere while your enemy could clearly see you. (This is being worked on and hopefully fixed in the near future)\n- Multiplayer against other players or against AI are the only two modes, there is no campaign which I think is a missed opportunity.\n- Steep learning curve that can be very frustrating for beginners since regular players of the game will know exactly what walls can be shot through, what angles work best and how to quickly peek corners to make the best use of the sometimes broken netcode.\n- Unlocking operators with in-game currency can take a long time based on your willingness to spend time with the game and how good you are. Just stay away from the starter edition or the game will be even more grindy since each base operators cost much much more than they normally would and you will be unable to upgrade to the standard edition once you bought the starter.\n \n[h1][Conclusion][/h1]\nWhile this iteration of the series is vastly different than it\u2019s predecessors, I think it\u2019s a solid addition to the series. Rainbow Six Siege is very unique in what it does and we have yet to see a game like it. I recommend it to fans of SWAT 4, Insurgency, and generally anyone who enjoys or is interested in tactical first person games where you have to be cautious of your surroundings, be aware of your enemies abilities, and a strong emphasis on teamwork.\n\n[code]\nEnjoyed this review?

It's not even close. This is an incredibly difficult game for an FPS, but the payoff is well worth it. At about 100-150 hours of play I felt like I generally understood all the maps, the tactics and meta for each, and the play mechanics; at about that point it starts to become an FPS that makes all others obsolete. I completely understand that the grind time is a huge barrier to entry, so here are some suggestions to speed it up:\n1. Study the maps as much as possible and know the layout, player spawn locations, objective spawn locations, and the locations of destructible surfaces. Obviously this will come with experience, but you'll get a massive head start by memorizing this early.\n2. Change your expectations; this is not anything like CoD or Battlefield. You might not get a kill for the first 10 hours of play. You might not have a positive KDR for 50 hours. You might not get MVP until 100. All of this is fine, because this is a **hard** shooter. Expect that you're going to perform awfully for a while, but that it's going to feel really, really, really good when you start hitting your milestones.\n3. This is a teamwork-based game. Use a microphone if at all possible, or at least type in chat, and communicate with your team. If you're dead, watch cameras and call out positions to your team. This also helps you learn the names of the rooms and gets you accustomed to the routes players will typically take.\n4. Pick operators you actually like playing. Don't just follow online guides' suggestions on which operators to unlock--read about and watch footage of operators and pick the ones you're excited about. Just want to play the starters? That's totally fine, Thatcher and Jager are two of my absolute favorites. If you stick to ones you enjoy, you'll enjoy the game that much more.\n\nOn the flip side, the community is not great. There are a lot of toxic players who can't handle loss, have no patience for new players, or just want to make someone's day suck. Don't let them get to you and use the voice/text chat mute features as much as you need. If they're getting really out of hand then just report them.\nThe Renown system (the currency you buy operators with) accrues really slowly, so if you're okay with in-game purchases, buying some Renown to get some operators more quickly might help. Personally, I think forcing myself to play my new operators until I'm able to unlock a new one helps me get proficient all my unlocked ones, but that's my opinion.\nThe ranked system isn't perfect, but it's a cool way to take the experience up a notch when you get pretty good at the game. Don't stress out about it too much, plenty of players only play casual.\n\nThis really is a fantastic game when you put the time into it, and it's up to you if that's an investment you want to make. As long as you understand that it can be a grueling process in the beginning, potentially 100 hours until you're proficient, and that the community can be exhausting, I say take the leap.", "timestamp_created": 1549099368, "timestamp_updated": 1549099368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 337, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.942105352878570557", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47719639": {"recommendationid": "47719639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198276865200", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 2535, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550373447}, "language": "english", "review": "Tutorial if you want to buy a diffrent version of the game (like if you can get complete but you cant because you bought starter)\n\n1- Go to help in the top left of your screen\n\n2- click steam support\n\n3- click on rainbow or search it \n\n4- \"permanantly remove this game from my account\"\n\n5- you can now buy complete, advanced, etc\n\noh also the game is good", "timestamp_created": 1545514185, "timestamp_updated": 1545514185, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 943, "votes_funny": 245, "weighted_vote_score": "0.933362483978271484", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28380923": {"recommendationid": "28380923", "author": {"steamid": "76561198053843295", "num_games_owned": 360, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 123770, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529434752}, "language": "english", "review": "Man, I've gone past 1700+ hours now....This game has truly made me addictive heh. Well, here's a review for those considering purchasing this game!\n\nI was in the Closed Alpha, Beta, 2 of the Technical Tests, and the Open Beta (I have the exclusive skin to show off from alpha :3). I've seen this game grow from a game that Ubisoft had originally planned to scrap, to a Wonderful game filled to the brim with people.\n\nYear 3 Update Review (General stuff still stays): Updated January 3, 2018\n\n===================================================\n\nRainbow Six Siege is Currently with 88,000+ Playerbase on Steam servers alone, and the numbers keep growing. The game is meant to be a Tactical game with droning ahead of time, clearing rooms, and communicating with your Team. Defending a position, flanking enemy attackers, etc.\n\nPeople compare this game to CoD run-and-gun a lot, which makes me laugh. If they want to run and gun, I hear their *thump, thump, thump* from so far away, I can easily wallbang them (AKA: Shoot them through the wall). Any Person who plays proffesionally will tell you that running is ONLY to be used when your in a safe area, outside, or you know an enemies position/hear him and want to get the jump on them. \n\nCSGO players will compare it, but R6 is a lot less twitch shooting based, and there are several aspects that CSGO doesn't have that R6 does. (but that would take a bit so don't want to bore you)\n\nNow that you have a \"general\" idea of what this game is about, I want to address the main issues that seem to pop up with people, and talk about them to help alleviate fears of buying. (if I miss something let me know).\n\n=====================================\n\nToxic Players ----- Generally speaking, most of the playerbase is quite nice, but since the numbers and popularity have made it grow, that won't be as prominent to some, and if they get on your nerves, Mute button is there to use. However, find that nice person whose willing to play with you and laugh with you at ridiclous things, and you've got yourself the start of a squad right there.\n\nTeamkilling ------ A big issue of people who are TK in Ranked and Casual which Ubisoft has taken steps, and are still addressing. If you kill a teammate at the start of the round, you get kicked and penalized (doesn't matter ranked or casual). If you've extensivly TK in other games, you can get banned for longer. Friend and me did a test on it to confirm it.\n\nCheating ------ If you were to tell me BEFORE Battleye, I would've said STEAR CLEAR OF THIS GAME. However, since the addition of Battleye, there are rarely ANY cheaters now. Despite what you might \"think\" of a person is hacking, people like myself have trained very hard to get good and you need to be able to identify a cheater from a good player like any other game. Another benefit of Battleye is that it tracks the IP of the offender, and if that person gets another account from the same computer, Battleye can block them, or watch them closely to ban again.\n\nPay2Win ----- I'm not sure how anybody got this in their head, but there are people out there who do. This is easily destroyed since the game doesn't take weapons and specific operators as it does Skill and Game Knowledge. Plain and simple. For fun i've gone recruit (default class available to new people) and murdered enemy teams in casual. Thermite for example, is one of 2 operators who can breach Reinforced walls, While he can make things easier, he isn't required to win. There is nothing in this game you can't earn from just playing the game. This includes most skins and cosmetics. Pay2win is not anywhere in this game.\n\nTeamkicked By Squads ------ Another thing that's been popping up from time-to-time is people complaining that people in a squad kick them in game to troll. This is something Ubisoft has been working on for a while now, and I managed to talk to a developer on this matter for a brief talk. There IS a program running to \"check\" frequencies of squads kicking people who aren't in their squad. An easier solution is just to form your own squad of buddies.\n\nSpawnkilling ------ This comes down to game knowledge. In competitive, I'm suprised if they don't try to spawn kill me. You need to know which windows/doors offer the best \"peaking\" for killing people, and go out carefully. In casual you'll rarely see this as far as I know, but if your going into competitive, this is a heads up to make sure you memorize positions. \n\nRunning Outside To kill ------ Another \"Game Knowledge\" Category that you should know. If you see a completely broken down window/door, be very, very careful of people running out to kill you, or peak kill. Drone it out and kill that pesky roamer! Also, if they have to break down a window/door to get out to try and kill you outside, if you have a decent headset on, you'll hear that \"CRASH\" in no time. It then comes down to your reaction and pinpoiting the noise location. There are guides out there that can help you see the most prominent ones. If you take time to memorize, you'll get the hang of it!\n\n============================\n\nI removed the netcode question since it was lengthy and put it into the comments section so that I may update this review a bit more thoroughly. Check the comments section if you want to see it!\n\nUpdate on January 3rd:\n\nHere we are, 2018. Heading into the 3rd year already and more people jumping in as we speak. So where are we at with 2018 and R6 siege? Let's take a look:\n\nWe've obtained a higher hertz servers from 50hz to 60hz, along with general improvements to ping, and a high elmination of ping abuse. It's a lot harder to ping abuse now then it was 2015-2016. \n\nWe've obtained the final people in Year 2 in the form of Dokkabei, Zofia, and Vigil. Dokkabei being a decent person for most given scenarios, with the ability to help pinpoint enemies, and to hack cameras which is something the community has been wanting for a long time. How she'll play out later is to be determined, but currently she's doing fine.\n\nZofia is a huge addition to the attacking side with her ability to concuse 4 times and with two built in impact grenades with her launcher. She isn't the \"Ash 2.0\" that everyone assumed at the beginning because Ash will still be able to peek a lot better, and is better at straight up rushing. Zofia I feel is a slower version of the rush with clearing out Objective rooms primarily, rather then charging in. She's currently a huge asset to the attackers with her versatility (RIP Capitao :/) \n\nVigil is....interesting to say the least. He's able to prevent drones from seeing him, but they will know he's nearby via a small indicator. He's great for making the attacking team wary about entering an area because they know he's \"in that room\" but not \"where in that room\" which is a great deterrent for keeping the clock ticking down.\n\nApparently, Ubisoft is working on something called \"Operation Outbreak\"....its also been confirmed which means possible zombie mode. I'm not entirely sure how I feel about this as assets are being diverted to create this, which I feel should be placed more on either the multiplayer, or heck, improving Terrorist Hunt into something glorious.\n\nUbisoft is also looking into modifying Echo and Castle slightly to perform differently. How we're currently unaware at this point, but it raises the question of how we'll improve one of the biggest operator problems: Tachanka.\n\nTachanka is still quite useless in most given scenarios.

They made this desision to appease China since they wanted to move market to them. Many people were angry and rightfully so. Although, Ubisoft has changed their mind. Because of what they were about to do, Recent reviews have gone from very positive to mixed and even all reviews have gone from very positive to mostly positive. I'm making this positive review to educate you that they have chosen to cancel operation censorship and will me undoing all the changes that would have come with opperation Wind Bastion.

My approval still stands as a $30 sale price means payng for operators with more money up front and less hours over time.\n\nI'll try to inform as well as review here to clarify matters for everyone. I'll preface by saying that the last multiplayer game that I was really into was Titanfall, causing me to become affected by and interested in the loss of players and abandoned servers:\n\nThe Starter Edition is a smart implementation by Ubisoft to get more fresh blood onto the servers because the cost of entry was previously too high for many. To be clear: There is no difference between \"starter players\" and \"regular players\" besides the amount of time it takes to unlock new Operators (classes). Starter players play on the same servers as everyone else, play on all the same maps, and have all the same unlockable Operators available as everyone else. \n\nTo explain how your Starter game would begin, I'll briefly explain how this game (rather generously) doles out content. All maps and Operators are \"free\" and included in patches, the Operators only being paid for in time played or with UbiBucks if desired. This makes the Season Pass practically useless; on launch it offered a year of minor privileges and early map/operator access which is now a six month or so privilege. This means the player base isn't segmented, and there is no map or operator that you can only acquire by purchasing the Season Pass or DLC. That said, the Starter Edition randomly assigns you one attacker operator and one defender, along with enough UbiBucks to purchase 2 additional operators of your choosing so you start with 4 at your disposal. \n\nEverything you do in the game earns you Renown, which is the fake currency used to purchase operators or weapon skins/cosmetics. Starter players require about 12,000 renown to purchase an operator, while regular players only need about 2,000. Ubisoft calls this \"grinding\" to reach 12,000, but to me the point of a multiplayer game is that the gameplay is intrinsically fun and it doesn't feel like \"grinding\" to reach anything; the reward is that the game is fun to play. That being said, I know that in-game progression and unlocks have become a big thing for players these days, and the lack of things to progress towards is often cited as one of the main reasons why people stopped playing Titanfall.\n\nIf there's to be things to unlock, I'm actually glad it is the operators. In the 9-10 hours I've mainlined since buying the Starter edition, I earned enough Renown to purchase an \"on sale\" at 7,500 with a few thousand left over. The \"grinding\" is offset by daily challenges that offer extra renown, and there's at least one operator \"on sale\" in rotation every week. Here's the thing, though; operators take awhile to truly learn due to the nature of the game, and things are quite balanced to the point where a new operator is simply a new playstyle as opposed to any signifigant advantage over your opponents. My point is that by the time you really get close to mastering your 4 starting operators, you'll have earned enough renown to unlock a few more and/or bought a couple to see how they play.\n\nThat should be the clarifying out of the way. I've always wanted to try this game, from a glance it looked like the evolution of CS:GO I've waited years for without the harshness and indie/mod nature of a game like Insurgency and I wasn't far off. Like many people, it was hard to justify a full $60 purchase when CS:GO is $15 and regularly goes on sale, but Ubisoft has leveled the playing field with the Starter edition and finally made the game accessible to me.\n\nI want to address the issue of the \"full price for only multiplayer\" argument. I don't see the issue as that was par for years (UT-2k4, Quake 3 Arena, etc.), especially when maps and continued refinements are provided freely with the patches as they are here. This game doesn't need a \"campaign\"; the addition of a high-budget hollywood inspired heavily scripted corridor shooter that is commonly attached to modern shooters would only take away from the excellent balancing and clash with the gameplay style, failing to teach the player how to experience the meat of the game. Teaching the player how to play is exactly what the single-player content does in fact do. There are 10 \"situations\", each of which features a different operator and showcases the different skills, gadgets, and most importantly the pacing and nature of jumping into Siege multiplayer. There's also the option to play co-op Terrorist Hunt as a \"lone wolf\" instead of a team of five if you want to play by yourself. I only wish that multiplayer was playable with bots or that they add this feature in the future, the game already has deadly bots for other single-player content and the possibility is definitely there.\n\nWhy would you need to be trained to play a multiplayer shooter, especially if you're experienced with them? Because nothing else on the market plays the way that Siege does. It is a slow game, with time often spent in crouch or prone with sprint used sparingly. The lean left/right buttons are essential to leaning around corners. The \"time to die\" is extremely fast, with 1-3 connecting bullets being enough to kill most enemies. Some habits such as reloading after every fire need to be abandoned, as the reload speed is relatively slow and the bullets left in your clip could be enough to kill 1 or 2 more people before leaving yourself vulnerable while reloading.\n\nIt might be a slow pace at times, but it causes a white-knuckle tension that I haven't seen matched. It's thrilling to rappel up the side of a building, toss a grenade through the window and get a couple kills, then notice that the shrapnel left little holes all over the wooden walls to crouch and score a sneaky kill through. Most losses are tense enough to cause slamming of fists, and that same tension makes a victory give a wild rush that's made me cheer out loud sometimes. Siege is like action/shooter chess, a game that's simple to learn and understand but could take a lifetime to truly master. A high level game of 10 experts has a very high skill ceiling, with operators deploying and blocking deployments while using every angle of the map burned to memory and all the dynamic options of the gameplay. It may not be for you, but my prior multiplayer love was a lightning fast game with giant robots so anything can happen.\n\nThe port (if it even is a port) is excellent, offering all the options that PC players expect to scale from low-end to high-end rigs. It has 2 unique AA solutions; an exclusive temporal one that has some ghosting issues but addresses even sub-pixel aliasing, and a unique solution that halves the resolution but applies MSAA between frames to make up for the lost pixels while addressing the jaggies. It has built-in Twitch streaming features. It natively supports Xbox 360/1 controllers and Dualshock 4, offering options for deadzones and sensitivity to make controller play surprisingly viable. Basically, the devs understand PC gaming and this is no hobbled PS4 port.\n\nThis is also the first time that I've had to \"deal with\" Uplay. It's...annoying I guess to have a second client launch on top of Steam, but that's all I notice of it. It doesn't crash, it doesn't use up multiple GBs of RAM, it doesn't install adware and it didn't give me or my computer or my family AIDS. I was expecting at least some of that based on what I've heard, but it simply opens up when the game launches and needs to be closed when you close the game, a minor annoyance at worst for me.\n\nSo that was a shitload of words, and I might sound like I'm gushing, but this game really exceeded my high expectations of it. The $15 entry made it possible for me to play, and I wanted to spread the word to those on the fence and explain what you're getting into.

were a lot better back then community wise. I decided to update my review in response to the recent comments on it, and how I agree/disagree with them.\n\nAs with any increasingly popular shooter, the community won't always be the best. Before the game really exploded a year or so ago the community seemed pretty great, a very different feeling from CS:GO's community and COD's. It seemed like everyone playing Siege WANTED to have a very tactical shooter experience. It seems to me now that a lot of people don't really play Siege for that reason anymore. Though of course with the games growing player count, multiple sales and their ESL league it seems to have brought in a lot of the toxcicity from other shooter games. \n\nWith my recent experience of the game I've noticed a lot of leavers and teamkillers in Casual. Ranked not so much, but I noticed that there are so many people who will leave a match after losing the first round of a game. I've had people TK multiple teammates because they were accidentally TK'd in the previous round, and a lot of players bashing on people who are new to the game.\n\nDespite these issues, the game still comes out as my favorite competitive shooters in my game library, and I still keep my thumbs up for the game because the community doesn't completely ruin it for me. I'm guessing around 75/85% of the time you'll be qeued with a compitent team that's willing to cooperate and coordinate to make a really fun match. It is by far one of the least toxic communites. And although it does have its toxic people, it's easily dismissable because of how fun the game really is, and how much it has grown and changed for the better since its release.", "timestamp_created": 1449043012, "timestamp_updated": 1514411905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5858, "votes_funny": 3454, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912939608097076416", "comment_count": 174, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24828161": {"recommendationid": "24828161", "author": {"steamid": "76561198119604299", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 47377, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 104, "last_played": 1551846662}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite literally had a guy on my team named Koolaid Man and the only character he played as was Thermite. \n\nHe proceeded to scream into his microphone \"OOOOOHHHH YEEAAAAAAH\" everytime he breached.\n\nthis was the best match I've ever played in any multiplayer game.\n\n12/10\n\nUpdate: found him and befriended him, we are now the sledge/thermite koolaid tag team.

Playing on EU servers at higher ranks (Gold III - IV, Plat I and above) you had a high chance to meet at least one cheater. Simplicity to cheat and absence of adequate anti-cheat and ban system resulted in ridiculous situation, where a lot of people had cheats running in the background in passive mode, and they toggled it on, when they thought they see a cheater (so-called white knights).\n\nIt happened so often on EU servers when you're winning, for example, with score 3-0 and then one guy in the opposite team decides \"scr\u0435w that, they must be cheating, they can't be this good, so I gotta toggle on too\" and then one-tap insta-HS with hipfire until the losing team wins. That was a real plague, so a lot of people stopped playing.\nBut it's all now in the past, thankfully.\n\nIt's a huge fail for UbiS*** that it took about 9 months after release to implement normal anti-cheat, but anyway, now game is much more comfortable and is not a breeding ground for cheaters anymore.\n\nRight now this game is one of the best (if not the best) tactical co-op game.\n\nPros:\n- since the game is more expensive than CS:GO, not so much kids and smurfs to spoil experience;\n- every round is unique; there's a lot of ways to win and tons of ways how to neutralize enemy;\n- balance; as of now there are no absolutely OP operatives or strats, everyone and everything is counterable;\n- every choice matters: any hole, any placed reinforcement, any thrown grenade etc will either help you or your enemy to gain advantage;\n- a lot of ways how to outsmart enemy (or get rekt trying);\n- there's always a chance to win even when you think \"it's gg\". 1v5 clutch (by legit player) happens very often in this game.\n\nNeutral:\n- 1-shot HS from any weapon = instant death;\n- 1 melee hit = instant death (except Caveira);\n- only 3 votes needed to kick (unlike 4 in CS:GO).\n\nCons:\n- ping. it matters a lot and when you have 100-120 and your enemy has like 40, then he has huge advantage;\n- netcode. it still sucks sometimes when you hit enemy in the head 3 times and it just doesn't count for some reason and you get killed by his return fire OR when you glitch through the wall and got killed through it;\n- peeker's advantage (as a result of ping and netcode issues) here is totally, absolutely OP;\n- bad servers. sometimes you just can't connect to a friend or get disconnected from match, it's so frustrating;\n- bad or raging teammate can make you lose round or game no matter how good others are (so you need a set of people to play with);\n- if you get kicked from Ranked, you will get banned anyway.\n\nThis game is great choice if you're tired of CS:GO. Too bad that there are still many issues present, but fortunately Ubi is working on it. Sounds strange that Ubi is fixing things in own game - can't believe, but I see the difference with my own eyes.\n\nRecommended to play with 3 or 4 friends.

It is a 5v5 tactical FPS, with intense close quarters combat. Urging tactical decision making to experience fierce firefights and explosive action at every moment. The amazing level of destruction and gadgetry always keeps the game in motion, intense and dynamic. Every destruction could change the pace of the game which brings in a new level of playing; opening line of sights, using the destruction to your advantage and a fun strategic approach. You can coordinate with your team to alter the environment into a defensive/offensive stronghold, trap fortify and breach to progress through the environment to complete the set objective. You will be able to barricade doorways, reinforce walls, rappel and more to plan attacks. There are many operators for the attacking and defending side each equipped with their own unique ability to use in the game. A diverse choice of weapons and gadgets accross the operators really challenges the style of play. You are able to equip skins for both characters and weapons. Also, a variety of attachments are available for each weapon. All operators have the ability to reinforce, barricade and use drones for setting up.\n\nUbisoft is always adding new operators which are great, always trying to improve the user experience. For me personally, I have not encountered any major problems with this game, it runs smooth, connections seem to be good and overall experience is great. New maps and also changes to the current maps keeps this game going. \n\nIn game currency (Renown) is great you can just about get everything without using real money to get skins and operators. All operators are available to purchase with renown so you don\u2019t have to buy the season pass, the only downfall is that it\u2019s quite expensive and does take some grinding to get enough renown.\n\nHave not touched competitive, just offers ranks and badge to show your skill level, which I am not too bothered about.\n\nThere is a singleplayer mode called terrorist hunt which you can play with friends, essentially the main game with bots, just to practice and have fun.

With the exception of games like TF2 that I played a long time ago, and that was just goofing around on my computer that barely boot up. I mostly avoid it because I suck at these sorts of games. I have terrible aim, terrible reaction time, terrible eyesight, and add in a pinch of just being plain crap. So why this? And better question, if I am so bad, how can I even possibly do well and recommend this game?\n\nWell I started playing the game because a friend told me to buy it to play with them. Everyday they would ask me to buy the $20 version of the game so I could play with them. Keep in mind this was maybe 5-6 months after the game launched, so I know it had a rough launch and was not well received. Eventually I just caved and bought it so they would not bug me anymore. I played some matches, I was understandably bad, as expected. Sarah being bad at first person shooters is not a new thing, it is just a fact of life. The game still felt really cool and tactical feeling though, so I kept with it until I unlocked some new operators to try out.\n\nAfter unlocking them, I was also bad with them. I messed up bad, felt embarassed, wanting to hide in a corner and cry for embarassing myself in front of the everyone. But I stuck with it, learned, and was to a lesser degree, a useful member of the team. As long as I got whatever my operator ability was used up, I could experiment without worrying about being useless to the team. I tried things out, practiced more, got better, tried new things.\n\nWhere did that put me? Well my aim is still bad, I still miss obvious stuff, and I still cant peek a door and get someone before they get me. But what I did learn was that you can still win with better tactics, instead of always needing more skill. See, I just need an extra half-full second, if I can use spacial positioning or some other way to gain that extra reaction time, I stand a chance. With better tactics, you can usually counter many skilled players. Thats how I can get the success I have had in this game. It feels like it rewards more than just raw aiming/reaction time skill. \n\nThe game is good, and has only gotten better. Over time they have ironed out many problems the game had early on, and the new characters are always a treat to use. The only thing that has gotten worse is the community, with all the csgo kids moving over to playing Siege, but that is tolerable at the very least.\n\nAs for which game pricing option to get, the $20 one is not a bad choice to check out the game and see if you like it. If you do, you can spend $40 in the in game credits to unlock all the base game operators (thus equalling the normal game purchese price, meaning no net loss for you). It is what I did. \n\nSo in other words, I highly recommend it.

Let me try to describe it for you.\n\nRainbow Six Siege is a Tactical Shooter which its focus is completly in the multiplayer and competitive, with just some \"tutorials\" that are done alone and can give you some Renown, these are called Situations and there are 11 Situations, 10 are Alone against Bots and the last one called Article 5 is cooperative against bots, like a normal \"Terrorist Hunt - Bomb\" but with some story being it.\n\nSo, the multiplayer where this game shines is composed for 2 groups of operators, one being Attackers and the other Defenders, every round you switch between them with your teammates. Rainbow Six Siege has 3 gamemodes avaliable right now, which are:\n\n[h1]BOMB:[/h1] Attackers have a defuser which has to plant near the bomb - Defenders need to defend A and B from the Attackers.\n\n[h1]Secure the Area:[/h1] Defenders have a Biohazzard Container which they have to defend from the Attackers. Attackers have to  stay near the Biohazzard for 10 secs to win. (If both teams are alive near the Container even if the time runs out, they keep there forever until one of them leave or die on the area.\n\n[h1]Hostage:[/h1] Defenders have to defend a hostage, which attackers have to rescue. If attackers get their hand on the hostage all they have to do is run out of the map near the smokes outside and it's over, they won it.\n\nAlso there's two kind of games to play the gamemodes, Casual and Ranked.\n\n[h1]Casual:[/h1] It's made to play for fun, practice or just to get enough level to play ranked. Which team scores 3 first win, and if theres a draw it joins the overtime and who wins takes the victory.\n\n[h1]Ranked:[/h1] It's a competitive match, where you and your teams decide where to spawn/protect, who win 4 rounds take the victory. If theres a draw it's extended for 2 more rounds, winning who makes 6 rounds. Also, Ranked is only avaliable for players which have got Level 20 on the game, and after 10 Ranked games played you get a ranked based on your performace on those games.\n\nSo, knowing all gamemodes you may think \"Wow, that's not too much for a expensive game like that...\". But that's not how it works young padawan. The game have classes of characters called ingame as Operators, which operator has it's own Skill, that can used in favor for their team.\n\nEvery operator (Besides recruit) have 2 Reinforced walls to put in game, that can be used in Walls and Trapdoors.\n\nOne Primary Weapon (Defenders mostly use SMG's and Attackers Rifles)\n\nSecundary Weapon (Pistols in most of the cases)\n\nThe Special Skill of which Operator.\n\nAnd Gadgets, which are;\nDefenders Gadgets: Nitro Cells, Deployable Shield, Cameras and Barbed Wire.\nAttackers Gadgets: Breach Charge, Drone, Frag Grenade, Rappel and FlashBang Granade.\n\n\n[i]Now try to think: Using all the things the game give us with a map almost full breakable and 5v5 gameplay... It's insade the infinite things we can do to attack and to defende, the teamwork is way important and the knowledge of the game, also a good understanding of the enviroment![/i]\n\n[i]I loved this game and will always do, even with Ubisoft sometimes making us kinda sad with their bugs and downgrades I still can't stop loving this game!\nSo if you at least liked 50% of the things I said, try it out! I surely know you won't regret!

It's great tactical competitive, ranked, team-effort type of game. It has variety of operators to play and choose from, each with an own unique trait, ability for your play style. You can read more about operators on the website of Ubi.\nYou need to watch lots of guides for operators, weapons, maps and to play at least 50 hours+ to get used to the mechanics of the game, maps, weapons, recoils, etc. At the begging you'll be a little bit confused what to do, where to reinforce, how to position yourself, how to peak, move, etc. That's why I recommend to go thru \"Situations\" first and then choose your operators and play casual. You need to get to level 20 to play ranked and personally I think they need to change it - let's say 50-60 level, maybe? Getting to level 20 is easy, but you're still learning the game mechanics. \nAnother important thing is that you don't need to pay for operators - If you play you earn renown and you can buy them for free. Of course it takes time, but for me it's better to get them one by one and get used to the operators and their abilities.\nMy first operators were Ash and Mute, since then (120h+) I almost unlocked 50% of all operators and just bought Year 3 season pass. Don't stuck with couple operators - every operator has advantages and disadvantages on the maps.\n\n[b][u]Pros:[/u][/b]\n* Game is optimized\n* Great graphics \n* Servers are good\n* Variety of operators that fits your play style\n* Variety of maps, new missions \n* It's fun, tactical and competitive\n\n[b][u]Cons:[/u][/b]\n* Toxic people\n* Casual is mixed of high and lower rank players - not balanced\n* You have to pay for Boosters to get more renown to unlock operators or to pay to unlock them. If you don't want to pay you have to grind renown and unlock the operators - it takes time.\n* Even if you're really good player on ranked - you need to have decent teammates to rank up\n* It takes time to learn recoil, maps, spots and tricks - watch guides on YouTube\n* Price - wait for sale\n* Ubisoft client must be used\n* Skins, operators and all in-game purchased are expensive.

Well here it is.\n\nBare in mind that this review is aimed for new players starting out...\n\n[u] INTRO [/u]\n\nTom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is a tactical first person shooter where it excels in intense 5v5, highly competitive close quarter combat. Rainbow Six Siege (or R6S) is one of  the most inovative first person shooters, focusing highly on teamwork to gather information and take out your foes.\n\n[u] OPERATORS [/u]\n\nIn R6S players will have a choice of operators to pick from before a match starts. These operators have to be unlocked through in-game currency called \"Renown\" that is earned by completing matches, completing Terrorist Hunt missions and finally by successfully completing challenges that are given daily in game as well as weekly in the UPLAY overlay. Anyway, depending on the edition of the game you bought, you will start of with some default operators (usually easy to use for begginers). Every operator in the game has its own unique special ability or \"Main Gadget\". These gadgets, in the right hands, can aid you and you're team to victory. Ubisoft done a great job adding personality into these characters; all which have their own voice actors and quotes in game. All of the operators come from well-know Counter Terrorist Units that are active around the globe. CTUs such as the SAS, GIGN and FBI SWAT and many more are all featured in this game. The devs are always coming up with new operators and they always surprise me with what the release in terms of new gadgets.\n\n[u] ATTACK [/u]\n\nThe attackers in R6S must work together to secure an objective that is situated inside a building. When the match begins, attackers will have some time to prepare the attack by scouting the area using remote controlled drones that can be used to relay intel to you teamates by spotting enemies and finding the objective. Attackers may use their drones as much as they like as long as they have not been destroyed by the defenders. When the \"Preperation Phase\" has finished the attacking team will now be able to enter the building and fight their way to the objective. Every attacking operator can scale the map by rapelling up and down to get better angles or reach a roof / balcony. Finally attackers have exclusive equipment that can also help them to secure objectives such as Claymores to watch you're back, smoke granades to cover lines of sights and Frag / Flash granades to flush out defenders in the objective.\n\n[u] DEFEND [/u]\n\nDefening in R6S is always different. Many maps have their own characteristics and defenders must adapt to defend specific rooms. While the attackers are droning in \"Preperation Phase\", defenders have to fortifiy their position by reinforcing walls that can be breached and destroying attackers drones to prevent them from gathering intel. When playing as a defender in R6S, players may conjure different playstyles; Roaming - where a player will run around the map trying to harras attackers before they make their way to the objective, or just simply holding you're ground in the objective room and watching angles. This all depends on what operators have been picked. Furthermore, defenders are also have exclusive equipment that can can be deployed. A deployable shield can be placed in doorway to force enemies to vault over and reducing their accuracy slightly or they can be used for mobile cover. Barbed Wire is a excellent choice to gather information through sound and to also slow down the attackers. C4 or \"Nitro Cells\" can be used to blow up you're oponents remotely; it can be stuck to surfaces to blow up walls and ceilings too. Finally defenders have access to \"Impact Granades\" which instantly explode when they make contact with a player or wall. They are usually used to create rotation holes in and around the objective.\n\n[u] MAPS & ENVIRONMENT [/u]\n\nR6S has a vast selection of maps where different tactics are required. A typical map will consist of three floors: Basement (B), First Floor (F1) and Second Floor (F2). Each map contains destructible walls that can be destroyed and penetrated by both teams. Higher caliber weapons will siginficantly increase the damage to a given surface. Shotguns are a great choice to quickly open up hatches or holes in the wall. Every season a new map is added and it reflects the new operators that come with it. For example with the new operators being Spanish, the new map will be Featured in spain.\n\n[u] GAMEMODES [/u]\n\nThere are only THREE gamemodes in R6S: Secure Area - where attackers must access a specific room and hold it for a certain amount of time. Defenders can contest the objective if they are together with the enemy. Its very similar to hardpoint from other games if you wish but it stays in one place. Hostage - where the defenders must prevent the attacking team to capture the hostage and extract it outside the map. If the hostage is killed by an attacker the defenders win the round but if a defenders decide to execute the hostage for any reason then the atacking team will win the round. Finally we have Bomb - where one attacker is equiped with a diffuser that is needed to diffuse one of the two chemical bombs that the defenders are protecting. When the diffuser is planted, defenders must act quickly to destroy the diffusing device by approching it and holding the interact button. Attackers will win if the diffuser completes its job or all the defenders are dead.\n\n[u] COMMUNITY [/u]\n\nThis is in time of writing the 4th most played game on Steam. The R6S community is a mixed bag so to say. I personally came accross amazing teammates which I have become good friends with online. There are a lot of friendly players that you will come across that will communicate with you and praise you for doing the same and playing well. However, you will also encounter trolls and toxic players in this game but Ubisoft's Anti-Cheat Battleye is constantly banning toxic players that have been reported for toxic behaviour such as intentional teamkilling and constant use of homphobic slurs and racism in chat. If you encounter those people just igonre and report them. They will almost guaranteed to be banned since the devs have took toxicity seriously in this game recently.\n\n[u] CONS [/u]\n\nAlthough the game is very well optimised, it suffers from hit registration problems. Where headshots are key in this game as they will instantly kill you, players like myself have become quite frustrated when you land a headshot and it just does not connect. In some cases you can hit an enemy, see blood come out but they will take no damage. You will know this becaue when they kill you, the kill-cam will display the killers health. However Ubisoft is working hard and they are implementing a better system to help with sight missalignment to provide the best hit reg. \n\nMoreover, there are some minor bugs when it comes to the Ragdoll physics of the game. Some dead bodies may spaz out and have their arms or legs elongated although its not gamebreaking.\n\nMost of the significant glitches that players exploited have been fixed such as the \"Shield operator no recoil glitch\" that was found by accident.\n\n[u] CONCLUSION [/u]\n\nTo summarise, I would higly recommend Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege to all FPS lovers. Take your time to learn the maps and operators. There are lots of guides out there and videos that explain how to play as each operator. This game is absolutely amazing when played with friends so don't be shy to make some in-game! \n\n- Bartozy", "timestamp_created": 1527251947, "timestamp_updated": 1528412217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879793047904968262", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38456678": {"recommendationid": "38456678", "author": {"steamid": "76561198411108858", "num_games_owned": 23, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11271, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548604934}, "language": "english", "review": "are u bored of CSGO?\nthan get this game trust me", "timestamp_created": 1513778958, "timestamp_updated": 1513778958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 686, "votes_funny": 108, "weighted_vote_score": "0.88123631477355957", "comment_count": 49, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31733330": {"recommendationid": "31733330", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134398310", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 5902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1538685614}, "language": "english", "review": "*Played my first casual match, I didn't know how to get around the map*\n\n- Sorry guy's I'm new, I don't know what I'm doing.\n- It's okay, don't worry about it.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1494709083, "timestamp_updated": 1494709083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 301, "votes_funny": 55, "weighted_vote_score": "0.897285938262939453", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31520832": {"recommendationid": "31520832", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997979780", "num_games_owned": 591, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 173496, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1631, "last_played": 1551817891}, "language": "english", "review": "Plus\n- Best Co-Op game I've played.\n- A lot of things to learn and master.\n- A lot of satisfaction if played with friends.\n- 3 years later the game is even better\n\nMinus\n- If you are looking for a casual game, this is not really one\n\nMust own, must play.", "timestamp_created": 1493803220, "timestamp_updated": 1542968727, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 239, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.871994197368621826", "comment_count": 31, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36652538": {"recommendationid": "36652538", "author": {"steamid": "76561198445797132", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537631509}, "language": "english", "review": "DON'T BUY THE STARTER EDITION!!!!!!", "timestamp_created": 1511207083, "timestamp_updated": 1511207083, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1892, "votes_funny": 274, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890643537044525146", "comment_count": 84, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32608272": {"recommendationid": "32608272", "author": {"steamid": "76561198214237227", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 133114, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1534896379}, "language": "english", "review": "This game... OH THIS GAME.  I got this game believing that I would be playing a tacticool shooter that involved alot of thought.  Although this is true to some extent, aim is KEY.  The game has probably one of the highest skill ceilings of any game i've played.  Keep in mind this is Ubisoft.  The devs can be extremely annoying sometimes not fixing issues that are apparent and hated until months after release of the change that caused said issue.  That being said, the bugs and issues can be looked over.  Although hit registration is GARBAGE and has been better and worse throughout different seasons.  During the new \"Operation Health\" a season designed to literally FIX BUGS AND ISSUES has made the hit reg worse than it has been in the past.  Example: you drone out a room and find the enemy.  You know where the enemy is and shoot at them hitting the head.  In the kill cam, you see that their head is tilted back clipping into their body and a cloud of blood is covering their face.  As frustrating as this can be, it is something that gets better and worse.  Although this is a part of the game I would still call the game playable and enjoyable.  After roughly 2k hours in this game I have to say that it has lost the original luster it once had.  However, I still come back and play this game semi-often and come back when new content is released.  The community is very \"eccentric\"  I suppose you could say.  It's mainly a wasteland of memes and cancer but hey atleast its entertaining.  Long story short, buy the game its worth the money.  DO NOT BUY THE \"starter edition\".  This will put you at a severe disadvantage and make you pay alot more to unlock things.  Speaking of unlocking things, there is no paid DLC or gameplay content locked behind a PayWall.  All buyable content is strictly cosmetic and most of it can be earned by simply earning points by playing the game.  Buy it.  It is in fact worth it.  Just be aware its not without its fair share of baggage and can be daunting to new players.  Learn from others, watch kill cams and watch Youtubers play it.

The community is better than most and the developers listen to feedback, which is sorely needed and a breath of fresh air in the PC gaming world.\n\nOf course there are some balancing, network latency, and team system problems, but Siege still has a framework that works and is constantly being improved upon. Every map has complexity that can be learned through experience, but is frustrating for beginners. Even the game system itself has so many mechanics to learn that it can be very frustrating at the start. This also gives the game great variety and replay value, however, and still retains its value well beyond a year after release. Just embrace that Siege isn't quite like the other shooter games that you play.\n\nTerrorist Hunt lacks the variety and spontaneity that multiplayer offers, but still acts as a healthy diversion from the sometimes frustrating multiplayer experience.\n\nRemembering how far this game has come since its beta just strengthens my resolve that it will continue to be a great FPS with a healthy population for (hopefully) a long time.", "timestamp_created": 1485723425, "timestamp_updated": 1485723425, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 285, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87504279613494873", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28421268": {"recommendationid": "28421268", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995391291", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 20179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547836943}, "language": "english", "review": "I am gonna go ahead and compare Rainbow Six Siege to CS:GO, like many others do - but there's a good reason for that.\nTo give you an understanding of my transition to Siege, you must know that I've played over 1,600 hours of CS:GO on this account and another 600 on my smurf account. To this day I think that CS:GO is one of the best multiplayer shooters ever made, but at this point it has been heavily malnourished by its creators and in turn, the community. \nWhat I love about CS:GO is the factor of skill. A testament to a good game is that you get better at it the more you play, and CS is, or WAS, just that. That was when the only thing that mattered in the game was how good of a player you are. But that has changed a long time ago. CS:GO has become a money making machine and nothing more. Valve has proven to not give a crap about the \"everyday player\" by having an anti-cheat system that is beyond broken. For a company that makes SO MUCH money, you'd think that protecting the game from cheaters would be their priority. It isn't. The priority is new cases, skins - simply just more ways to make more money. I came to a point where I had to pay an additional 7$ a month for ESEA to properly play CS:GO, but I gave hope of supporting a game that is simply heading nowhere. And I'm not going to dwell deeper into the community - anyone who has ever played the game, will know how toxic, immature and unpleasant it is.\n\nAfter I gave up hope on Counter Strike, I started looking for a shooter that would replace it. I've tried many - Insurgency, Battlefield, Call of Duty (well I had to try) to no avail, because even though I had fun playing those games, they were all missing something - something that would keep me there for longer. And then I found Siege. \nEven though I'm only about 90 hours into the game, I already know I'm going to keep playing for a lot, lot longer. It has everything I was looking for. Skill factor? Check. Good maps (mostly) and a lot of ways to approach a situation? Check. Customisation that doesnt require you spending hundreds of dollars? Check. \nWith Siege you get to appreciate the hours you put into it, because the game might be easy to get into, but it requires a lot of hard work to master. And that makes it a good shooter. It plays however you want it to play - either fast paced, or a slower tactical approach and it rewards you for actually using your brain. I was never a big fan of Ubisoft, but with this, and the few hours I played of For Honor, they're finally heading in the right direction.\n\nSo if you're tired of CS:GO, and you're looking for a replacement, try Siege.

Just a tip for anyone reading this thats thinking about getting the game, don't get the starter edition, you only get like 2 operaters, one per side, and you will have to work your way just to get all the rest, which is just time consuming. Its best to get the standard edition if you're on a lower budget, you get all the base game operators, which is 10 per side so 20 in total. The community may be a bit toxic at times although once you have a party of 5, you will all have a good time. Sound matters in the game, any loud foot steps could put you at risk of getting killed so its recomended to be more stealthy instead of just waltzing around the map. There are so many ways to enter/breach through rooms which makes the game even more fun. You may be holding an angle at a doorway but then they suddenly come behind you or above you. Its always best to spot the enemies through drones or cameras before entering rooms. I hope this review helped you or gave you a taste as to how this game works, have fun playing it.\n\nUPDATE: This is my fault, as of March 6th, 2018, Ubisoft updated the starter edition from 2 operators to 6 now. 3 per side. So if you'd like to grind for the rest of the 34 operators (including dlc/year operators)  for only the price of 12500 or 25000 renown (in game currency), then go ahead :)\n\nSummary: good game boys", "timestamp_created": 1533612298, "timestamp_updated": 1542824283, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 332, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.918495833873748779", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47618459": {"recommendationid": "47618459", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304578108", "num_games_owned": 100, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 46711, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1108, "last_played": 1551763933}, "language": "english", "review": "Now when I see cameras on the street I wanna shoot it out.", "timestamp_created": 1545186098, "timestamp_updated": 1545186098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 150, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842411935329437256", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24792093": {"recommendationid": "24792093", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152287971", "num_games_owned": 255, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 194167, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1551279131}, "language": "english", "review": "is gud.", "timestamp_created": 1470742309, "timestamp_updated": 1470742309, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 80, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802183270454406738", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19412125": {"recommendationid": "19412125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044821038", "num_games_owned": 80, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 10610, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454266731}, "language": "english", "review": "You say wait, and everyone waits. \n\n[h1] 11/10 [/h1]\n\n[i] You'll never see that in CoD.

I've been a R6 fan since a child, have enjoyed most of the games. My favorite being Rainbow Six 3. I liked Vegas as well, but am fully aware that that game wasn't what R6 was about, which is methodical movement, and tactical planning. Vegas represnted a shift from the more slow, tactical game, towards a generally more fast paced cover shooter, which I fully enjoyed...but I would be remiss if I didn't say I enjoyed the  slower game more. So that's my history with R6, and generally I don't enjoy too many FPS games, but I've played countless hours of CS 1.6, and Source, as well as a crap ton of DooM 1/2\n\nSo with that in mind, let's talk about the game. I am going to entirely focus on the current state of the game, as people who are buying it now won't have any idea about the past. The game itself works fine, not many bugs are present (thanks to ironing out of a lot of bugs through the last year. (If you want to know more about the horrible state of the initial game I'm sure some loser much like myself wrote a whole entire thesis about it)\n\nGraphics-Even while a year old, the game is still alluring. If you're the graphics whore type, I don't think you'll be disappointed.\n\nSound- Because of the way this game is played, alot of detail was put into how sounds are made, and how you hear them. I should also note that the sound in this game is a gameplay element. Simply put, if you want to get good at this game, LISTEN. Broken glass near you and you hear footsteps crunching? Your enemy might be there! (or a friend, watch that FF yo)\n\nWill you (or I) have fun?- That depends. See, I am a total hermit, I don't like people generally, nor  do I care for MMO's..or whatever you call todays MMOs (I like the term CRAP). The reason I bring this up is that this game is MEANT FOR MULTIPLAYER ONLY. So please keep that in mind. I enjoy this game completely. You can tell based on the HORRIBLE FACT that have put in 700+ hours into this game. I literally noticed this fact yesterday and had to lay on the ground and re-evaluate my life. This game is great, I liken it to playing a shooter, but having some puzzle elements to it. Gameplay is boiled down to this:\n\n----Two teams of five operators square off on either a King of the Hill style match, hostage rescue, or bomb defusal scenario-----\n\n----Each operator has some special ability depending on them being attacker/defender, I won't go into specifics here, but you should look them up, also Montaigne is my favorite. Attacker/Defender abilities are designed to counter each other, aka one operator is paper, and another is rock. This is an oversimplification of course, but that's the general idea.\n---THERE IS ALSO a mode called Terrorist Hunt which pits a team of five against NPCs, can be fun if you don\u2019t like playing against people because they are too mean and hurt your feelings.\n\n---Teams have to work together coordinating their abilities to complete their objectives, when they win they all go to Dizneeland (TM) and have the most amazing time.---\n\nIn order for this game to be fun, you have to work together, coordination is key. If that is your bag, then I would recommend this game to you. Playing with friends (as in with most multiplayer games) would make this game more enjoyable. But I don't have friends, so to hell with you. This game is also enjoyable playing solo with random other players. Generally the player base here is a lot more mature than I\u2019ve seen in other games (COUGH OVERWATCH COUGH), which is a huge plus for me, because I\u2019m getting old, and don\u2019t like kids. I hope this review is helpful, and you RESEARCH this game properly before you buy it. BE A SMART consumer.

Censoring swear words in a game for people aged 18+ really shows how Ubisoft is trying to squeeze every part of SJWism into this game. Banning people for saying words like nibba or negro just shows the insecurity of the whole team. Now after the newest update this game just went from bad to worse. Removing skulls, gambling (note that real-money and ingame-money gamble alpha packs are still being promoted), things that hint to sexual content, the melee symbol (from knife to fist) and even blood textures on walls  just to earn even more money from the chinese market because those things are banned there? I really enjoyed the game, I looked past the bugs and the matchmaking system that is still in beta after 3 years but censoring so many parts of the game just to be politically correct and earning as much money as possible? No thank you Ubisoft, I don't need that shit in games.\n\nEDIT  21/11/2018: Ubisoft just stated that they will reverse the changes. This was only achieved by the community outcry.

It requires a lot of strategy and teamwork in order to win matches.\n\nGameplay : By my own experience. Most of the time. The gameplay was feeling kinda slow but that's how it's supposed to be I guess as this game requires strategy and careful planning or you pretty much going to die and you know that you did a huge mistake and as a result you got punished by the game.But at the same time it feels rewarding since you learning from it and trying not to do the same thing again.\n\nCommunity : I have already experienced lots of toxicity and many other things from different games that I'm playing at the moment such as CS GO, Overwatch and League of Legends and I thought it would be quite the same on R6S as well. Well, I was actually really surprised. Now of course nobody is going to avoid toxicity since people with anger management issues would play the game and I have met some toxic people on this game but most of the time I have got matched with people who actually know how to play the game and also being very helpful for the new players. You know how good it is to meet people who act as human beings after coming back from a game with toxic people?\n\nGraphics and optimization : When I hear that a game is made by Ubisoft, My thought is going to be \"Ohh damn, another broken game with lots of performance issues\" but it was really far away from what I thought. I'm playing on i7 4790 and GTX 1070 on the Maxed out settings (With the Ultra HD textures as well) with the T-AA and indeed can maintain above 144FPS without any problem and the game indeed looks well\n\nIn conclusion, I really looking forward to keep playing this game in the future and would try a bit the competitive match-making really soon (Would update the review about it later on) and have to say that Ubisoft did here a great job with the game and indeed improved it overtime and kudos to the devlopers of the game about it! I can without any doubt recommend this game for people who are looking for a strategic game that they can enjoy for a long time.\n\nCompetitive MM : It took quite some time for me to decide how the MM is, Each game has it's own flaws but the MM does have some really serious issues that make the competitive mode to look like a joke and yes, I'm mostly talking about leavers. The penalties are pretty much worthless and doesn't do anything in order to prevent players from leaving the matches. 15 minutes for each penalty (May be fine for the first cooldown) isn't enough by any means. And some matches can be frustrating not because of a poor teamwork but when you have to start the game as 4vs5 or even worse in some games. When a person disconnects in the first round. it should offer to the team the option (Like a remake that exists on LoL) if they want to continue the match or shut it down and only the leaver would get a lose. But when everything is going as it should be (Getting a great teammates or going with your premades), Then indeed the competitive is worth it and can provide a lot of great time.\n\nOverall rating : 8/10\n18/1/2018: Added \"Competitive MM\" (Sorry if it looks like a rant)", "timestamp_created": 1513295289, "timestamp_updated": 1543249217, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 139, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.832490861415863037", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47546566": {"recommendationid": "47546566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198389397412", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 24451, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 6216, "last_played": 1551820464}, "language": "english", "review": "IQ's butt is truly mesmerizing\n", "timestamp_created": 1544884253, "timestamp_updated": 1544884253, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 522, "votes_funny": 534, "weighted_vote_score": "0.880714476108551025", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39207877": {"recommendationid": "39207877", "author": {"steamid": "76561198332209063", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 35554, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549312376}, "language": "english", "review": "the best game with the worst servers.", "timestamp_created": 1515506614, "timestamp_updated": 1515506614, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 181, "votes_funny": 81, "weighted_vote_score": "0.851524949073791504", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 8, "review_score_desc": "Very Positive", "total_positive": 86984, "total_negative": 20671, "total_reviews": 107655}}
