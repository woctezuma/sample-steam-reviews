Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\n\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\n\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\n\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\n\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\n\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\n\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\n\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\n\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\n\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\n\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\n\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\n\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\n\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\n\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\n\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\n\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\n\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\n\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\n\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\n\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\n\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\n\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\n\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\n\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\n\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\n\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\n\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\n\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\n\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\n\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the United States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.

It's simple. Stand on arrows aiming at a platform and kill the other players. Simple as that. The controls are exactly the same as other Valve games, except the fact CTRL doesn't let you crouch this time.\n\nOther than that, the gameplay is almost the same as every 90s-early 2000s Valve game. The framerate again is amazing. The map is too small to be honest. I'd honestly play it more if there were more people playing the game. If the maps were more creative I'd also play even more than I already do. I'd love it if there were maps that had walls and stuff so you can't see where the other players are, making the game harder.\n\nThe character design is kind of eh. The powerups are actually really good, I love how you can combine more than 1.\n\nThe sound design here is awful. The screaming sound when you fall off of one of those areas gives me a headache. It's annoying and it hurts my ears.\n\nThis game was probably rushed but I still think it's a really fun game. I hope the game gets more active one of these days. I got it yesterday for 49 cents but the game at full price is $4.99.\n\nI don't recommend the game if you don't want to waste money on a game nobody plays. I recommend it if you find an active server. It's quite fun.\n\nFinal score: 60%\n\nAs I said, it was rushed, sound design is awful, character design wasn't that great, nobody plays it too much, maps aren't creative, and that's all I didn't like about this game. I think it had a potential and it still is a really fun game. If you want to buy it though, I recommend buying it during a sale or something. I got it for 49 cents which is a pretty cheap price.

I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s a meme because it was an unpopular Valve game or because of its absurdity, but the latter is why I actually like it. Ricochet is a game where there are a bunch of small platforms floating in nothingness with boosters along the sides that shoot you to other platforms. Your character is equipped with disks that you can throw and, upon hitting a wall, wall ricochet off. If the disk hits a player, it\u2019ll knock them back. The general idea of Ricochet is to knock other players off of these small, floating platforms with your disks. While this is the idea, I think myself and many other people find it much more effective to decapitate people instead. To do this, you right click to use up all three disks you have \u201cloaded\u201d to send out one disk that will instantly kill whoever it touches. So what happens most of the time is people try to get point-blank to guarantee the insta-kill. This can be fun in its own right, though, as there are sometimes goose chases on all of these platforms with launchers and other times where people try to long-shot the insta-kill disk. Other times you might be chasing someone and they turn around and hit you instead. It\u2019s simple, zany fun for the shortish sessions my friends and I sometimes have.\nOf course, that\u2019s the thing about Ricochet. You probably aren\u2019t going to find anyone online, so you have to get your friends to play\u2026which can be a tall order depending on who you\u2019re asking. This game really only serves a purpose as a game you recommend playing out of nowhere and, if people agree, it can be a fun time for half an hour.

I became suicidal, cutting deep into my wrists and wishing the emotional turmoil would end. I opened up my computer and planned to have one last good time before I ended my pain-stricken and worthless life. Suddenly, out of nowhere, a notification popped up on my desktop, a steam gift, I could only wonder what it was. I finally used my last essence of courage and wonder I had left in my battered and bruised body to open it. Ricochet emerged on my screen. \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 it, I might as well have some fun on my last day of measly existence. I downloaded and opened the game. A flash of colour, the amazing soundtrack, enjoyment. I came to the epiphany that it had not been a worthless journey. I had rediscovered Jesus. No not Jesus, one who is greater than he, the legendary Gaben. I played it for hours on end. Win after Win. My wife came to her senses and realised the sexy alpha male she was missing out on. She came home, all my children in her hands.\n'I miss you' she cried.\n'Eat a shit Bethany, I have Ricochet now'.\nI slammed the door in that bitches face. I could hear her wail into the cold night air, her cries piercing the air like a gunshot in an enclosed room. She got in the stupid, run down car that she drove, pilling the disgusting fruit of my loins into it. Good, I hope that she died. I returned to my computer to see a notification, Ricochet. I opened it and it was a direct message with a picture attachment, a fully naked Gaben in a silk curtain stared into the camera. The captioning was, 'Hey sexy, if you really love me, you'll put your\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665in the usb drive, see you soon, x', at first, I was repulsed and confused, but it occurred to me, this was the will of the aforementioned higher power. Of Gaben the Great himself. Without further hesitation, I did as I was instructed, it hurt, but it was a required evil. I became sucked into the machine, Dick first, and arrived in the map 'rc_deathmatch2', and saw a lone figure crouched on the ground, after closer inspection, I realised they were just short. I walked over and saw the familiar angelic face, and glasses, I saw the sly grin spread across his face, he took a step toward me.\n' Hey man, you want some skins', he said sexily.\nI ran and embraced him, lifting him off the ground.\n'I love you, Gaben',\n'I love you too',\nWe stepped off the path and hopped in the Legendary Kart, one seat.

Doesn't mean it's a bad game.\n\nRicochet's game mechanics revolves around simple movement. The player can move side to side, back and forth but can easily fall off the platform they are on. Players are meant to jump platform to platform, but are only able to by stepping on the arrows at the edge of the platform. The arrows then launch the player into the air and towards another platform. A player in the meantime, can jump at the same time you can and both of you can end up colliding, falling into an abyss of darkness. Or, one player can hit the right mouse button and kill the other guy with a Frisbee The player has the ability to shoot a disk to decapitate the opponent. Some of the maps I have played so far are quite intriguing, but don't offer any significant background to gaze at.\n\nIt's quite a simple game, and you basically are going to get what you pay for.

This game is a mod of the original half-life that came out in 2000, however because of its thriving community and plethora of mods, its age has only really now begun to show. It places you in a future alternate universe where the entirety of existence depends on your ability to partake in the activity of \u201cDuel to the Death Space Frisbee\u201d or DDSF for short. Below I've made a table to outline all the various elements of the game with a rating at the end.   \n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th][b]Concept[/b][/th]\n        [th][b]Description[/b][/th]\n        [th][b]Rating out of 10[/b][/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Story[/td]\n        [td]The story of Ricochet is a deep and complex one. You are placed in a totally new world, where it only seems as if people are interested in this sport \"Space Frisbee\". You are never told anything about your character, except that they are a Space Frisbee player. That being said though, your character is made to be disposable, and when your character dies, it's over. You are placed in the shoes of a new person, who wears the same clothing as you, and sounds the same as you, and often shares the same fate as you. It's a highly critical commentary on today\u2019s culture, where it seems as if people are losing their lives to something arbitrary, almost a sport, for no real distinguishable reason. It makes the player contemplate what they are doing with their lives, and whether it is meaningful or not. I won't spoil the rest of the story for you, but all I can say is that you should look forward to epic conspiracies, insane bosses, and one of the most exciting and fulfilling endings in all of video games.[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Gameplay[/td]\n        [td]Now, Ricochet is truly one of this games that you can describe as \"easy to learn, difficult to master\". Its gameplay seems simple at first, as it begins with \"throw disc and hit object\" but as you progress you find more ways to play the game using its initial mechanics. First you're introduced with obstacles that your discs bounce off of, allowing you to start having your discs ricochet. The obstacles then change in complexity and usefulness, as near the later parts of the game, you even start to avoid them as they can be very deadly. There are different power-ups for your discs that change the way you use them, which gives a greater feeling of accomplishment when you figure out how to use one of the power-ups to its fullest affect. Ricochet\u2019s gameplay respects player intelligence by giving you many different ways to play. The depth of the mechanics have been compared to dwarf fortress, and although I wouldn't go that far I can certainly see players sinking thousands of hours into this game trying to really figure everything out for themselves.[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Graphics[/td]\n        [td]There isn't too much to say here. For a game that came out 14 (now nearly 15) years ago, it looks quite good. When in came out it was among the best looking games to date, and remained that way until about 2005. Despite looking a bit aged its color and stylistic focus make it easy and pleasant on the eyes, while still allowing for good atmosphere.[/td]\n        [td]8[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Multiplayer[/td]\n        [td]I'll just start out by say the multiplayer is AMAZING. It captures the cinematic and atmospheric feel of the single player, while allowing player interaction in a diverse open world. You're allowed to find various \"Arenas\" in which you may do battle with your friends to see who's the best at DDSF. With a booming community, and an incredible amount of modded servers you can easily find yourself playing this multiplayer for hours on end. Even though it's been 14 years, because of its very in-depth gameplay and large community, the Ricochet multiplayer is still one of the best you can find on this platform.[/td]\n        [td]10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nAll in all, I'd give this game a 10/10. Everything about it is amazing and enjoyable, from its single player, multi-player, stunning visuals, in-depth gameplay, and did I mention its kickin' soundtrack? Well it's amazing.

The people around me are no longer just people to me, for every person I see is just a target waiting for the sweet release of a flung Laserdisc to decapitate them, breaking them from their meager existence that have been ignorant to the touch formed by the greatest thing our Creator Lord Gaben has granted to us. \n\nYou see, Half-Life was put on this Earth to distract the people of the Steam Civilization, which was built in his image to hide the true gift in plain sight. You may ask for some merit for such a preposterous statement, if you can take the time and listen to my story you too will be enlightened by the masterpiece: Ricochet. \n\nOnce I reached 1,200 hours, all servers seemingly went down to reveal only one remaining, the name of this server only contained one letter: G, even though such a queer disruption of my playtime was ensuing, I was blinded by the addictive desire to play Ricochet to pay any attention. It was password protected, but it didn't stop me from trying to breach into the glorious arena, I tried a series of standard passwords such as: Valve, Steam, Ricochet, etc. After a great many attempts, I sat back and thought hard on some clues, the maker of all the things I've dedicated my life to is Lord Gaben, and the server name is just \u201cG\u201d, it all made sense. The password must be: \u201cGabe Newell is GOD\u201d... I was correct, how could I be so arrogant and stupid, it was so obvious and everybody knows God and Gaben are synonymous. \n\nMy router began beaming my request into the entangled web and it shot back connecting me to the server, there, I sat in the goldsource downloading menu which displayed various things that were in a language beyond human comprehension. Once the seemingly endless amount of time I sat there came to an end and I was in the server, my player spawned facing my opponent. The timer rang loud while the anticipation for a glorious fight grew, the same old countdown vibrations that were hitting my ears ended and the game began. \n\nThe other player, which possessed the absence of a player name, began his launch forwards my platform, though he was quick witted hopping from platform to platform with an ease and finesse, my raw aim and skill carried me through the entire skirmish. The points stacked up and time seemed to fade away, my mind was of nothing besides the match. Laserdisc after laserdisc, my arms grew tired, my stomach ached for more snacks, my eyes burned bright red like gems, all biological interfaces stability were now corrupting, but my soul was now even more infused with the game. My opponent no longer seemed like a stranger, I began to know him better than even myself, his play style grew into appearance and his strategical follies were now unearthed allowing me to achieve the first 1,000 points and the victory I strained myself for. \n\nThe host timescale froze, and our characters were now stuck in a dimension absent of change, this broke my flow state and allowed me to tear my eyes away from the luminessence to just stare off into my dark room. This was a good chance to reflect on the event which had taken place just seconds ago. I knew I just finished an accomplishment, but, an accomplishment of what? It just didn\u2019t make sense, why would something like that even happen? Is this real? Or am I in a dream? Before I could ponder my mind into its own world, a barrage of steam notifications came flying to my account, it was from the man I had just faced, his message read as so: \u201ccome look outside,\u201d before I could even finish the message I heard a revving of a powerful engine drawing me from my shitty office chair. There he was\u2026 Gaben standing in front of his 2014 Porsche Cayman packed with a 911s engine. I was ecstatic and ran down to greet him, but before I could speak he put his hand up and spoke\u2026\n\n\u201cQuiet, I know what you\u2019re thinking, lets just go and all your questions will fade away, like shit games in Greenlight.\u201d\n\nWe hopped in Gaben\u2019s 2014 Porsche Cayman, packed with a 911s engine, and zoomed off to Valve Headquarters. I\u2019m not much of a talker, and I didn\u2019t get any more talkative sitting next to my all time hero and man whom is richer than both [i]Oprah[/i] and [i]The Don[/i], but I could tell he wasn\u2019t much of a talker himself as we only spoke once, which was only about his car. He went into great detail about it, especially about his cars mods which he emphasized that they were \u201cpaid mods, just how they should be!\u201d\n\nAfter a couple hours passed and the smoothness of the car ride which brought me a nice nap ended, we were at the doors of Valve\u2019s new office. I busted through the doors and was overwhelmed by all the memorabilia that poured into my senses like a nice big glass of Ruby Red Squirt. Gaben, watched me prance corner to corner in excitement from the entrance, giving a Jolly laugh reminiscent of old Saint Nic (and its rumored they are actually cut from the same bloodline); we spent all day with each other playing Source games and just chatting it up on the latest games, I really got to know the guy on a personal level which was really nice, but we knew this was just an entree to the main meal, a meal of something which was about to shock the gaming world forever.\n\nGaben led me to the janitors closet, that seemed rank until he pulled a secret lever disguised as a stale box of cheez-its, that opened to a lair full of hundreds of programmers and other various game designers, we walked through the legions of workers to Gaben\u2019s Throne. From there he sat high and mighty, drawing the utmost power from it, his voice boomed across the dark den of nerd stench congratulating me on my skill\u2026\n\n\u201c[b]YOU[/b]! Are the chosen one, the messiah, the man which will bring news that will change the landscape of gaming as we know it!\u201d A giant projector dropped down from the ceiling and started beaming what would become everything my life was building up for. \n\nValve\u2019s logo blared with its eardrum piercing music, which melted in with the rest of the cacophony that displayed a timeline of Valve and its image before fading away to a new title, the title formed from all the signature intellectual properties Valve owns to read word for word one at a time: \u201cCounter. Strike. Global. Trade.\u201d \n\nAnd before me was a new Counter Strike game where you cant kill people or do any of the other classic things you would do in a Counter Strike game, as the game was just a fucking excel like spreadsheet meant for trading virtual fucking skins. I notice Gaben in the corner of my eye with his face making the signature look of \u201coh yeahhh! Check it ouuut! Ya like it?\u201d \n\nNot amused one bit, Gaben\u2019s chosen Messiah walked out of Valve\u2019s Headquarters and hopped into the nearest Uber to shuttle his ass to the nearest state that has Assisted Suicide legalized. And while filling out my form I put the disease that was killing me was: Crippling disappointment. \n\nSo yeah, I rate Ricochet a 1/10 because its entire purpose from the beginning was to promote a skin trading game. \n\nGoodbye world, this is the last thing I write as the doctor just came in with the lethal injection.", "timestamp_created": 1519158922, "timestamp_updated": 1519159290, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 147, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798394262790679932", "comment_count": 35, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7810556": {"recommendationid": "7810556", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020537646", "num_games_owned": 557, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1255, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413403142}, "language": "english", "review": "Very skilled game.\n10/10 valve make Richochet 2.", "timestamp_created": 1385664374, "timestamp_updated": 1385664374, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 217, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815610885620117188", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7893035": {"recommendationid": "7893035", "author": {"steamid": "76561197994190800", "num_games_owned": 352, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 433, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1386087649}, "language": "english", "review": "Just like Team Fortress and Counter-Strike, this was once merely a Half-Life mod that Gabe Newell and his co-workers decided to put some extra effort into. It became a high-end standalone title, and brother, did they make a good job. Improved textures, mechanics and overall level design.\n\nThe game is pretty simple at its core; it's a elimination/free-for-all game where you have to use your surroundings, levels and weapon - the power disc - to claim yourself the big name of the game. Moving fast and swiftly between platforms in a blitz of your enemies is vital for succession in this game. It takes some time to learn, and even longer to master. But by studying your opponents, you'll pick up their tricks soon enough and give them a taste of their own medicine.\n\nOne thing that I love about this game is the amount of servers that are available, over a decade after the game's release. You'll never have to wait for a server without open slots, allowing you to easily invite your friends to play with you. Trust me, this game is much more fun with your friends. The more players who join, the better and more intense the game becomes.\n\nIn conclusion, I think this game is extremely underrated and truly deserves a sequel. Lots of Valve fans seem to have forgotten about this gem, and even Valve themselves don't feature it on their official website. But I'm living proof that this game is still taking breaths. Forgotten but not lost, this game deserves your love. It's a part of the CS1 Anthology and the Valve Complete Pack, so chances are that you already have this game and simply forgot that you have it. Otherwise, it's available for the low price of $4.99 here on Steam (50% off as I'm writing).\n\nAnd yes, the graphics might not live up to today's standards. But when games like Minecraft sells millions of copies, I don't see how graphics are an relevant issue.\n\nOh, a final tip to those who'll try this game out: don't fall.\n\n9/10 (Would buy this game for a friend.)", "timestamp_created": 1386059942, "timestamp_updated": 1386169177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 59, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.764901340007781982", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42441294": {"recommendationid": "42441294", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963765138", "num_games_owned": 1061, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 81138, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1523321311}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is still better than games they make this year.", "timestamp_created": 1527925793, "timestamp_updated": 1527925793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748278200626373291", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22510": {"recommendationid": "22510", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960415816", "num_games_owned": 76, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 104111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549124839}, "language": "english", "review": "I never asked for discs.", "timestamp_created": 1363144366, "timestamp_updated": 1363144366, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716070175170898438", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48624125": {"recommendationid": "48624125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152577586", "num_games_owned": 67, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 16, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550223941}, "language": "english", "review": "ricochet 2 coming april 12th\n-gabe newell 2019\n\ncan't wait for ricochet 2, this game was so fantastic in every way possible that i can't imagine how good the sequel will be.", "timestamp_created": 1548755518, "timestamp_updated": 1548755518, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.706305205821990967", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38112000": {"recommendationid": "38112000", "author": {"steamid": "76561198133086581", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 87, "playtime_forever": 9787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544987216}, "language": "english", "review": "Ricochet\n\nRicochet is really fun game to play with a friend or friends. You are offered basically 1 map, but there are some different maps in the server menu. The basic map works best since there is not so many players in this game. If you manage to find a server with maybe two players in it and join with your friend you can get some really good games and fun times. I seriously mean that. Sometimes you can start a really big game even 10 people might join sometimes and that is probably more than enough to be honest. On the bigger maps more players mean more fun.\n\nThis game might become a bit competitive after playing a while. It is good thing in this game. You can get some powerups which give you different \"plates\" to throw and \"plates\" do different things. For example one throws more than 1 \"plate\" at the time.\n\nThis will not get boring fast. Usually there is not that much people playing so it can get boring because of that... Overall this is really fun game and you should try this.

You can just tell the developers spent AT LEAST 25 minutes making this game.

But there are some games that are often forgotten, even though many people have them due to buying the Valve Complete Pack. Games like Day of Defeat, Team Fortress Classic, Alien Swarm. Some of them pretty good, others - more questionable. So I'm going to review the [i]BEST[/i] one of them: Ricochet!\n\nRicochet is a first person shooter, although I like to call it a first-person thrower: you literally throw discs at each other in hope of actually hitting anyone (and that's a major problem for a reason I'm going to talk about later). It was supposed to be a fun online experience with fast-paced gameplay and small, but complex maps, made in an authentic futuristic style (what else can you call a game full of colored platforms in space?!) There are a few power-ups that might give you an advantage over your hypothetical opponents, like the ability to throw quicker discs, throw three at once and others. You gain points by killing people (pushing them off the platforms mostly), and you get a bonus by [i]ricocheting[/i] the discs off of some weirg diagonal... things. They glow yellow, that's what's important!\n\nRicochet was never supposed to be competitive or serious, it was just a fun experience. So why did Counter-Strike get as popular as it did, but not Ricochet? I actually don't know. The game has one weird quirk: you can't shoot up or down. But that's definitely not the main problem, after all, you don't even need to: it would mess with the gameplay.\n\nSo, what's holding it back? Back in the day - probably, the existence of better, more hyped games in the same package. And a lack of content, I guess. Now? Well, you remember how I said that it's an online experience? Yeah, about that. Ricochet is so innovative, that you could even call it the first singleplayer online shooter ([b]THROWER![/b]) with no bots! No one plays this game. This is an unending cycle of not playing: if there's no one playing, there's no one to play with, so why even bother staying on a server for more than a minute? It's kinda sand, because this kind of game might actually become pretty popular with updated graphics and some [i]actual[/i] players. I'm not able to rate it, because I can only assume what gameplay might have been like, since, erm, no one plays it!\n\nThe only thing left to do is to quietly wait for...\n[h1]RICOCHET 2[/h1]\n\ntldr; best game ever 420/10 would rico the chet again", "timestamp_created": 1543618800, "timestamp_updated": 1543618800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.67569047212600708", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32000295": {"recommendationid": "32000295", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065743277", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1495902032}, "language": "english", "review": "13 servers and the only one that had a player on it was afk", "timestamp_created": 1495902224, "timestamp_updated": 1495902370, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682365655899047852", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "744643": {"recommendationid": "744643", "author": {"steamid": "76561197977171864", "num_games_owned": 464, "num_reviews": 115, "playtime_forever": 0, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 0}, "language": "english", "review": "The Future of PC Gaming.", "timestamp_created": 1379820363, "timestamp_updated": 1379820363, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.676628410816192627", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43018500": {"recommendationid": "43018500", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075720845", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529879105}, "language": "english", "review": "It had potential but still very fun", "timestamp_created": 1529879134, "timestamp_updated": 1529879134, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.639600038528442383", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18180509": {"recommendationid": "18180509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198041029444", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 2883, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1538902658}, "language": "english", "review": "Ricochet, I wouldn\u2019t really label it under being a hidden gem or obscure. I mean come on it\u2019s made by Valve, anything by Valve is known to a certain degree. But it is definitely underrated, people always shut down this game because it looks weird and or that it feels empty.\n\nValve certainly doesn\u2019t seem to like it, they pay no attention at all to it and made it worth extra less in the summer sale and didn\u2019t even talk about it in their backlog of old games which has the description of \u201cEleven games that changed the world, and one that didn\u2019t.\u201d... It\u2019s Valve\u2019s first game that was aimed towards being competitive and also isn\u2019t related to Half-Life.\n\nThe game\u2019s art-style is obviously derived from Tron, and takes place in some futuristic space planet arena thing. Regardless it\u2019s actually pretty cool. And all the sound effects are unique and satisfying, except I swear the sound when you freeze somebody with a freeze shot is the sound of two lightsabers hitting each other.\n\nThe game unfortunately has no music of any sorts, I joked about this in a video where it was titled the full soundtrack to Ricochet but it was just an hour of nothing. But this game really could have used some ambience or something.\n\nAnyway, the gameplay consists of switching through small floating platforms by launching yourself from a jump pad and throwing projectiles at other players and making them bounce off walls and such to either push them into the endless void below or to instantly kill them with a decapitation shot.\nYou can get powerups that power your discs such as rapid-fire, triple shots, power shots that decapitate, and freeze shots that can home in on other players. That last one may sound overpowered but it\u2019s actually the worst.\n\nThe game has three maps as followed: Arena, deathmatch, and deathmatch 2. Arena is the more competitive 1v1 map while deathmatch and deathmatch 2 are more for, well, deathmatches with multiple players.\n\nAnd that\u2019s about all the game has to offer in terms of content, but the game is actually pretty addicting and encourages competitive play and for you to pay extra attention to everything detail, especially when you start playing Arena.\n\nRicochet is very, very underrated and has a great and fun experience inside it especially with friends. It\u2019s only $4.99 and is usually $0.99 during sales. I definitely recommend it if you\u2019re looking for a really fun game to play with friends, or just want to experience a piece of Valve\u2019s history.", "timestamp_created": 1443149776, "timestamp_updated": 1443149776, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.704782187938690186", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10552306": {"recommendationid": "10552306", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999436678", "num_games_owned": 370, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1372397684}, "language": "english", "review": "A timeless classic that ages like fine wine.", "timestamp_created": 1403244737, "timestamp_updated": 1403244737, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.698357880115509033", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7616038": {"recommendationid": "7616038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072006735", "num_games_owned": 131, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 198, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550628234}, "language": "english", "review": "THIS IS THE EPITOME OF GAMES\nITS PERFECT.

The community understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these plays, to realise that they\u2019re not just smooth- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Ricochet truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn\u2019t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Red Playermodel's existential catchphrase \u201cAAAAAAAAAAA\u201d which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev\u2019s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

Don't listen to all of the hate it gets. Now, I wouldn't recommend spending \u00a34 on the game alone, but if you buy the CS Anthology or Valve Complete Pack, then give it a try. Sure, you'll find very few people. Sure, the gameplay is hard to get used to. But damn, does it feel good to soar through the air, decapitate a man and carry on. Now, so far I've only played one map, and only against bots, but I'm sure I'm going to play some more. Here are some things I liked and disliked - \n\n[h1] PROs and CONs -[/h1]\n\nPROs - \n[list]\n[*] Variety of powerups, each spawning randomly every time.\n[*] Two ways to kill: hitting off the edge, or decapitating.\n[*] An interesting way of managing how many shots you shoot at once.\n[*] No fall damage! Use those jump pads as much as you like!\n[/list]\n\nCONs - \n[list]\n[*] You cannot shoot up or down. This leaves out any potential of getting an awesome kill after falling.\n[*] Very few people who actually play. Yeah, this isn't the game's fault, or Volvo's fault. It's the same with most multiplayer games that aren't relatively new, such as HL:DM or DoD.\n[*] Few official maps to play.\n[*] [b]NO[/b] official Valve servers. \n[*] When bodyslamming a player in midair, not much happens, and it tends to be kinda glitchy.\n\n\n[h1] Finally -[/h1]\n\nI could probably list more PROs and CONs for Ricochet if there was a need/if I played more, however I don't feel a need at this time. I'd give it a 7.3/10. Don't bother buying it individually, but if you get it in a pack, give it a try.
