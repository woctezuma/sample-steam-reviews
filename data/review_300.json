I usually play Valve games (passed 2004) with the motion blur on, and here it actually is the best. Every other Valve game I've played before this usually has a rare framerate jitter but in this, everything is just fine! I actually have so much fun with Day of Defeat: Source, the community of people I've played with on it are all very nice people.\n\nEveryone I've played with is also a pro. So I'm basically a beginner to this game. But yeah I am alright at the game, I got about 21 kills in total so I'm alright at the game. My best weapons are the sniper rifle and the one where you need to go prone and RMB to start aiming. Again, the recoil with the machine guns is awful...actually, worse. I'd say the recoil in this game is so bad. I really really REALLY don't like it here. I am surprised they haven't taken off the recoil and did something better. Honestly.\n\nThe gameplay here is basically Half-Life 2, Counter-Strike: Source, and Half-Life: Source. Controls are the exact same again (Mentioned earlier). The gun design is better than it has been before. It's definitely an improvement from the original (just the recoil is the problem). More people play this game than the original Day of Defeat, and jumping doesn't take away stamina! So in the original Day of Defeat, jumping and running would take away stamina, usually. But in this game, running only takes away stamina, and this is an improvement. A much needed fix. I'm glad they have noticed this and fixed it. It was honestly really dumb in the original...but yeah that's Day of Defeat: Source. Anyway, final score time.\n\nFinal score: 85%\n\n15% taken off due to the recoil. But anyway, the game is just fine. It's definitely better than the original, if I'm being honest. It has REALLY good graphics (from what you'd see in a Source game) and the fixes with old problems are fixed, like jumping takes stamina, which actually pissed me off a lot. Anyway, this review is over. I'm finished. Anyway, thanks for reading the review, hope you found it helpful in any way.

Released in 2005, Day of Defeat was rooted in another industry fad\u2014the world war 2 shooter. In the same year, Medal of Honor European Assault, Call of Duty 2, Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30 and it's sequel Earned in Blood were all released. While the former games were largely single player story driven affairs, Day of Defeat Source was strictly a team based multiplayer game that distinguished itself by being extraordinarily balanced and offering phenomenal map design. \n\t\nPlayers can enlist with either the U.S. Army or the German Wehrmacht and skirmish over capture points or attempt to arm bombs on strategic assets. Each side has six classes that utilize historic weaponry and almost every weapon sets itself apart from the opposite side's equivalent in some way. While the German's Mauser K98 is a single shot bolt action weapon that fires slower than the clip fed semi automatic Garand that the U.S. Army's rifleman class uses, it's also more powerful. Similarly, the Mauser M712 side arm carried by the German Panzerfaust units chews through enemies at close range but the M1 Carbine used by U.S. Rocket troops is far more versatile being semi automatic and highly effective at medium range. With these differences, players often built an allegiance to one army versus another based on their weapon preferences. \n\t\nEach class also featured a set of quirks that required a bit of practice to master. Machine gunners couldn't effectively kill an enemy unless their gun was mounted, the recoil on these weapons is violent enough to have players staring at the sky box after pulling the trigger. This means that machine gunners are largely a defensive class along with snipers who are hopeless in mid range combat. The assault class utilizes early assault rifles which suffer from heavy recoil and are most effective when fired from a crouched position. Newcomers often favor the support class since their sub machine guns allow the kind of fast moving spray and pray tactics that modern shooter fans are accustomed to but the power and accuracy of rifle troops makes them easy prey at medium to long range where their automatic weapons are almost impotent. While it may be tempting to walk around with a rocket launcher, attempting to aim while moving is incredibly slow making players huge targets. These major differences in the play styles between classes make the experience rewarding and, in some cases, polarizing. \n\t\nThe six official maps offered with the game prove to be masterclasses of map design. In addition to the main lanes that take players to each objective, there are side routes that allow players to flank opponents and remove pesky snipers and machine gunners. Maps that are won by capturing all the territories feature a central capture point that requires at least two teammates to capture meaning it's impossible to go lone wolf and win a game. Uncoordinated teams will often find themselves entrenched in a bitter stalemate over these points\u2014especially on Flash which is the most linear map of the bunch. Coordinating your teams efforts and making a big push toward an objective on multiple fronts often yields victory. It's a far cry from the lack of teamwork required by many modern shooter games. While six maps is a bit disappointing the community has stepped in to pad the play-list with hundreds of custom maps.\n\t\nValve has continued to support Day of Defeat Source over the years, updating the game to include achievements and trading cards.

Rook was shadowing him, double checking each spot that Johannson had checked before.  I was in the middle with Peters, helping him carry the M2 Browning.  And Stewart was in the rear, covering our backs with his Thompson at the ready.\n\nIt was quiet.  Too quiet.\n\nThe bridge we had set out to capture was undefended, and we quickly set up a defensive position in case a German patrol stumbled upon us.\n\nThe sound started as a low rumble.  We looked around, at each other, confused as to why the ground was shaking.  It got louder, and we could soon hear the sound of people yelling.  We readied our weapons, getting ready for the enemy to throw a grenade or fire a Panzerschreck.\n\nBut nothing could prepare us for what happened next.\n\nA giant tide of German soldiers, all carrying trench shovels and primed Steilhandgranates in their hands, came around the corner, rushing at us screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nWe opened fire, but there were too many and we were quickly overrun.\n\nStewart was the first to go, having gotten overzealous with his Thompson.  He had managed to push the wave of Germans back, when they surrounded him and began pummeling him to death with their shovels.  \n\nOne of them, holding a grenade, charged Rook and Johannson from behind.  They never saw it coming.\n\nBy now, it was only me and Peters, him firing his MG wildly at the advancing tide while I threw frag grenade after frag grenade.  And then Peters started to run out of ammo.\n\nQuickly, I rushed up to his position with a new box of ammunition, but by that time they were almost upon him.  Peters quickly pulled out his M1911 and managed to squeeze off a few shots, but it wasn't long before he too was buried under the mass of grey and black.\n\nI was cornered, back against a locked door while I blasted soldier after soldier back with my Sniper rifle.  But it was no use.  They descended upon me, swinging shovels indiscriminately at my already bruised and battered body.

I could understand english and say simple things,, ask for stuff, whatever. I sucked. I got 10 kills. Or less. But each kill made me confident and then I'd get killed immediately. I was sad and said with my young voice, on an american server, \"please, I want to get good\". NOW, hold on. There were already people talking on the server, casually. But they all stopped for a moment and silence came. I think anxiety hit me, and I thought that I'd get kicked. But then... \"Again please?\" said by a russian dude. I said it then, and the rest then proceeded onto laughing, they didn't bully me, don't know why they were laughing, but felt like they were laughing at something else, and not me. One of the top players on the other team then said that \"Don't aim on the ground, aim over the hip, always have your crosshair close to the corner and always ask yourself where your enemies could be.\" - Nah just kidding, he said \"practise, boy, practise.\" And then the casualtalk started again, slowly I faded away, no one noticed me anymore. Of course there was this one person trying to gain attention by writing shit to me in the chat. But I didn't mind. I then got a sniper, and then went into a clocktower. There I waited looked out, scoped, shot. And a kill I got. While I did that, the topfragger, the topscore on the other team was talking about something that had happened at his work, but I killed him, and for the first time he stopped talking. He said \"Damn, that was a mistake, good kill!\" and then proceeded to laugh and then kept talking about his story. 2 minutes after that happened, I decided to say thanks, and I did. He just laughed and said \"No problem!\" we then talked for awhile. He told me how to get better. But I didn't understand a thing. And my internet cut off. It usually did that back then. I didn't even get to add him. I then tried to find the server, found nothing, couldn't remember his name. Haven't opened the game since, or maybe I have.

But despite the old graphics and funny animations, there is something special about this game - the gameplay.\n\nDoD:S gameplay is focused on tactic. It's the exact opposite of Call of Duty, Battlefield and games like that. The recoil is pretty big and unforgivable, players have to cooperate and carefully move around the map. It's usually impossible to run over a street without smoke grenades or using cover. One or two hits mean instant death. This type of gameplay probably reminds you Insurgency or Day of Infamy - sure, they are both unofficial spiritual successors to this game, at least Day of Infamy is definitely inspired by this game although DoD:S remains more open to new players and less hardcore.\n\nAt first I didn't even know if it makes sense to post a review of this game after all these years. Then I saw a gameplay video from the new Call of Duty and it was so childish and stupid that I actually learned to appreciate games like DoD:S more. Then I thought there might be still people looking for a WW2 shooter made for people with IQ over 50.\n\nI'd recommend to buy Day of Infamy instead because it's in my opinion the better and newer (even actively supported) game but DoD:S still has its own style so if you don't care about money and want to expand your collection of WW2 games or if you are simply a person who enjoys/wants all Valve games, this may still be an interesting game, even in 2018. And yes, it's multiplayer-only of course. No single-player mode at all.

I'm not aware at all of how the original Day of Defeat fared, as I never played it, therefore I can't make a proper comparison between the two.\n\nWhat I can talk about though, is obviously Day of Defeat: Source, having played it quite a bit and having fun with it. The game is set in WW2, and while a lot of games are set in WW2, nowadays with the massive trend of current and near future FPSes lately, it is remarkably a refreshing change.\n\nSource obviously made the maps and models look much better than the original game. They still hold up quite well nowadays, much like Source itself in any case, so for most people there won't be much of a problem when it comes to graphical fidelity.\n\nWhile I don't know how the gameplay in the original DoD was like, if it was anything like CS 1.6 to CS: Source, it may have ruffled a few feathers on the original DoD community upon DoD: Source's release. Or maybe it didn't, because of the gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is most definitely this game's strong point by a long shot. There are several classes to pick from, varied enough to justify their presence in the game, and fully suit the setting, just like the various weapons you have. The shooting feels good, just like most of the FPSes in Source.\n\nUnfortunately, it suffers from not having a whole lot of variety to it, both in game modes and in maps. And by now, there are naturally also other FPSes set in WW2 that feel and play a lot better than DoD: Source. There's still a community present, so you should have no difficulties jumping into a multiplayer game however.\n\nI would get this game. It's cheap and can be an enjoyable and refreshing game experience once in a while. Plus it's a Valve game, and those come with a lot of obvious perks.
