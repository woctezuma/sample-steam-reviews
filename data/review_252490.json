But sometimes Rust can be a game that makes you wanna punch your fucking wall. I\u02bbm sure everyone knows that the community is a fucking hellhole, practically every person I meet on this game is a slur spitting trash talking asshole, but the community can also be amazing, I\u02bbve met some real good friends of mine on this game. The gunplay is amazing, and I love the graphics of the game and aesthetics of the guns. The whole mining system is cool, but it\u02bbs not really my cup of tea. If you like Minecraft, you would probably like this game. To those new to Rust, the first thing you wanna do is try to make a friend, with a friend to teach you about the game it can be really fun. I first started without anyone, and it was really hard for me starting out. I wouldn\u02bbt say the game is worth what it asks for, I\u02bbd say it\u02bbs a 20 or 25 dollar game. To everyone that has just bought this game and is having a bad experience, I would advice you to take a break and try the game again in a couple weeks/months. Whenever I do that it really helps, and watching other people play Rust helps too. Thanks for reading my review on Rust, hope that you (Yes, you, the person reading this right now) have a great morning, day, afternoon, evening, or night.", "timestamp_created": 1550235987, "timestamp_updated": 1550235987, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.692202448844909668", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48974885": {"recommendationid": "48974885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198140074491", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 40522, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2693, "last_played": 1551574832}, "language": "english", "review": "i got raided", "timestamp_created": 1550087047, "timestamp_updated": 1550087047, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 132, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75272679328918457", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49110111": {"recommendationid": "49110111", "author": {"steamid": "76561198134430680", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 39788, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550455396}, "language": "english", "review": "As of now, I have 663 and I feel like I can review this game:\n\nMany of you may have the question, \"Is Rust worth a buy in 2019?\" ...  My response to this is why do you want Rust?  As of 2019, Rust is a pretty fun game and it WAS simple, until things such as the electricity update came.  Facepunch had a really, really, REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY fun game.  How this all ties into my review is the issue with this game. at the moment is the unfair skill gap really f**ks players in the a** and causes people to quit.  If you were like me and never knew what Rust was until you looked up a video and found \"SALTIEST MAN IN RUST\" or \"RAIDING KOREAN ZERG BASE\", you would think this game looks pretty fun.  Yes, if you like the farm and you like early game/mid game/end game skill gaps, this game is for you.  This game is one of the BEST games I have ever played, but it came with lots of downfalls.  I have broken countless mouses, keyboards, and headsets (one monitor lol) when I died in a raid or if I was countered.  I am going to be straight-up when saying, YOU ARE GONNA BECOME SUPER MAD AND SUPER ABSORBED BY THIS GAME.\n\nHowever, I would not like to bash on this game.  This game is super fun and great when you have friends or meet new friends overtime.  This game is always changing with things such as the Cargo Ship update and the Chinook Update, both in which were great and added LOADS of PvP.  This game is looked at a lot by Facepunch and is a game that has loads of care, time, and effort put into it.  NEW PLAYERS READ THIS ----->  JOIN A SMALL, 1X SERVER.   YOU WILL BECOME LESS MAD AND WILL LEARN ALL OF THE GAME MECHANICS.\n\nOverall, this is a yes for me.  I have met countless people playing this game.  I have had some of the best plays and the best in-game memories playing this game.  You will love this game, but you need lots of time and one or two friends.

I set up a base and was repeatedly killed but got back up and kept going. As of now, that base still stands, a whole floor taller than it used to be.\n\nI met a friend early on and we built a base, but were locked out and killed. We learned to get locks on ASAP. We built another base further away, we enjoyed it, we killed a kid with a gun so we had one then. Killed someone threatening to bring a flamethrower. At midnight, my wifi crashed. Apparently he had come with a flamethrower and burned the base. I learned to quickly get down a sheet metal door on the interior and go for stone ASAP.\n\nThe next day I went in solo. I settled down and built a base. It was a peaceful area. Built a stone base, my innermost door was sheet metal with a code lock. Someone burnt down the wooden door but luckily they couldn't get much further in. I rebuilt a sheet metal door in its place. Nobody bothered attacking it again.\n\nNext day same server, I was desperately trying to get a blueprint for a gun. I kept going out not too far onto the road and farming for scrap. The same kid would kill me and each time I would beg for mercy. I gave up begging and this is the shifting point when I realized that begging won't change anything, I'll die regardless. [b] Might as well get used to dying. [/b] The next day I was greeting my new neighbors because I shifted to a friendlier tone. Might as well try to make friends with those attempting to kill me. [b] Try to get as many people as you can to not KOS [/b]. I ran across someone I thought was a naked, and warned him about the bad guys. This little gesture saved me, as he happened to be the leader of one of the largest clans in the server. \n\nHe told his friends and slaves not to attack me and they have, but solely because of mistaken identity and then proceeded to give me bandages and apologize. Without them, I wouldn't be as far as I am now. As of the time I am writing this, I befriended them yesterday. Today they continued their peace with me and I am so thankful for it. \n\n[b] TLDR; [/b] The community may seem toxic at first and a large portion is, but an equal portion is friendly. Don't trust anybody, but don't NOT trust anyone. TRY to make friends, not enemies. I honestly suggest this game as of now and enjoy the hell out of it. The server is the reset is the one thing I am not anticipating, but it may teach me more yet again.

And i've gathered a lot of information so if you are looking to buy the game you'll like this list of pros, cons, and types of playing you'll find then my own description of the game itself.\n\n[h1]Pros;[/h1]\n1. The Open world is procedurally generated which means, random loot, random spawns, random loot, exc.\n2. The game offers puzzles and missions along with the open world that creates more content within itself.\n3. The ability to build basically wherever you want and in any shape you want.\n4. Constant new updates providing more content.\n5. Thousands of servers run both my the rust staff themselves and modded/boosted community ones.\n6. The game looks great and has continued to get better performance and graphic overhauls and the game has progressed.\n7. A great UI that is very easy to navigate.\n8. Crafting that makes sense.\n9. You can be anything.\n\n[h1]Cons;[/h1]\n1. Too many toxic 12 year olds screeching reeeee when they kill a naked with a rock.\n2. Not being able to change resolution of screen take (full, windowed, exc) after you have launched the game.\n3. Glitchy doors that will throw you inside of a wall. (im nitpicking tryign to find 5 things bad about the game lol)\n4. No Lore released about the world itself.\n\n\nI couldn't find five things about it really but this is my take on how the game was supposed to be and what it has become.\n\nRust was originally made as an open world survival game in which players prospered, we were all friendly, you could walk up to someones base and ask to join, you could farm without being killed every 14 minutes, you could get help taking down heli or the apc, you could share things, you could talk to players, You could build a real community within the game.\n\nBut now... 98% of players kill on sight, if you walk up to a 1x1 you'll get speared to death, you now get killed every 3 minutes when farming, if you ask for help they will turn on you or just take you stuff, if you share you will be raided because they will know you have more, you can talk to other players but again... 98% of them will screech reee in you rear before killing you, and if you try to build anything... You will be raided.\n\nI give rust a solid 10/10 on build quality.\nI give rust a solid 4/10 on community quality.\nI give rust a solid 9/10 on graphics quality.\n[spoiler]Overall i give rust a 7/10[/spoiler]\n", "timestamp_created": 1549657107, "timestamp_updated": 1549657107, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525862038135528564", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48888835": {"recommendationid": "48888835", "author": {"steamid": "76561198303574362", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4367, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 209, "last_played": 1551847668}, "language": "english", "review": "This game will bring hours of fun, this game brings everything in all one game, pvp,building,driving and plenty of funny moments I defenitly recommend this game though you will come across a few toxic people.", "timestamp_created": 1549765465, "timestamp_updated": 1549765465, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48928520": {"recommendationid": "48928520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198909023095", "num_games_owned": 2, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3421, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1942, "last_played": 1551771804}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Rust.

The graphics are shit and needs alot of work, the're bugs in the game that don't make much sense. But the game is amazing for the concept that it holds. The fact that it allows you to tap into your darkest nature is amazing. You can realy have mixed play throughs in this game. From being a naked on the beach then killing a semi geared guy with a rock of all weaopns is just fun. Insta dooming a farmer and getting all the loot that took hours to farm is so cool. When you meet a player who friendly and you team up only to realize that your new friend is reking it is fucking awesome. Rust can have quiet random content and the fact that you can do anything or that anything can happen is amazing. But be warned the game is hardcore you can be a asshole to anyone and get away with it or anyone can be a asshole to you and you can't do anything about it. You just have to deal with deez things in the game. friendlynes is not realy rewarded but you can get good gameplay out of it. You can play the game how it's to be played or you can just fuck around with players.

I've been playing rust as of this review for about 2 months. My first two hours trying to learn the game where just repeated kill on sight interactions on the official servers so I moved to a PVE server. I still do enjoy playing on that particular server, but its mostly alone & trying out things I've not done before. \n\nBut everytime I try to play on an actual PVP server, even ones with nice folks & good admins, there is always those guys who have to ruin it for others. I've done 4 full wipes now on pvp servers. Each & every time the biggest problem isnt the PVP, but the people who wait for you to go offline, then raid your base & lock you out of it. \n\nI have a job, & life to live outside of rust. I dont want to have to be online 24/7 to not wake up naked on a beach again. \n\nNo amount of traps, base designs or doors seems to help this.

You build a base using twig and slowly upgrade through wood, stone, sheet metal, and finally armored. Other players can break into your base with explosives and take everything you have for themselves. Thats basically all the game is a survival game with constant pvp, fighting, and wars. But anyways in my 4+ years on steam this is the first review I am writing because I dont think theres any game more deserving of a bad review in my entire library so far. So why shouldnt you get this game? Well first Ill go over the few good there is in this game and give some credit where it is due. Believe me, I dont like to bash games like this and I feel sh*tty just writing this review but this is a review Ive debated on writing for a long time, and im finally doing it, anyways to the good.\n\nPROS:\n\nGraphics: \nThis game is very beautiful and nice to look at, if you like to have good graphics in your games then in this specific regard this would be a big pro for you. Landscapes look beautiful with good textures and shaders with a nice bright color to it which makes the game feel alive.\n\nEnvironment:\nLike I just mentioned the game has a nice colorful and lively feel to it, and when you walk into the monuments (generated structures/areas) for the first time it is really cool to see the sort of trashed environment around you. The events are also awesome with supply drops, helicopters, cargo ships, etc. Theres even minicopters (with god awful controls) and some hot air balloons you can find and all of that just adds to the world and as said before makes it feel alive.\n\nBuilding:\nI have to admit the building system in this game is pretty good and there is some pretty good ideas you can come up with for traps and using the different types of structures in unique ways to make your base that much more harder to raid. The building generally feels smooth and super satisfying once you finally pull off building a good base and it can be genuinly \npretty satisfying once you pull of a good raid on someone elses base.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe list of pros pretty much ends there for me.\n\nCONS:\n\nGrindy/Repetitve Trash:\nIf I could describe 95% of the gameplay of Rust in one word, it would be grind. If you dont like to grind, click off this review now and completely erase any thoughts of buying this game, because you will hate it. Me personally, I dont like to grind too much, especially alone, but it is so much more bearable if I have friends to play with and talk to, and I will get to that next. But the list is pretty much endless for what you have to grind for in this game: Breaking hundreds and hundreds of barrels for scrap to research guns and items so you can craft them, basic resources like food, wood, stone, metal, sulpher, animal fat, fuel, actually finding a place to build etc. And while you are trying to do all of that, if you are in a populated server, you are going to be killed, over and over and over again. You are going to have to repeat getting a good 50% of that just because of you dying to other people, whether they have bow, crossbows, pistols, rifles, it doesnt matter, you will die in this game so many f*cking times no matter how safe you think you are or no matter how good you think you are or how much you have gathered and grinded just for someone to come along and kill you and take for themselves right before you can make use of it. And I get it, at the games core, its meant to be that way, the game is meant to be brutal and you are somewhat signing up for it by playing the game. Obviously you dont know that at first until you actually experience the game unless you happened to watch gameplay before buying. But that is part of the reason I am writing this review, to be the one to warn you what you are signing up for by buying and playing this game. And after you die all those times and have to regather all of that stuff and finally get it to safety it just becomes more and more repetitive every time you do it.\n\nToxic Community:\nThis games community is pretty bad, its far from the worst community Ive seen in games but it is still quite bad. Partly because like I said everyone just kills you on sight and then you are forced to kill on sight yourself because you are afraid of being killed on sight. And its just an endless loop for everyones mindset. And even though it just makes the game more toxic than it already is, if you do decide to get this game you might as well kill on sight or just run away the second you see someone because if you dont they will just come back and f*ck you over in some way, shape, or form. I learned quickly to not trust anyone and it is because of those initial people that kill on sight that it forces everyone to do the same, ultimately making the game more toxic, I think you get my point. But that is far from it there is so many other ways this games community is toxic. I cant tell you how many times people will go on the beach with end game gear and just massacre every fresh spawn in sight just because they can and just because they want to f*ck other people over. I have killed fresh spawns before as well I think most have but I only do it when they get in my way when I am trying to loot not just to make everyone as miserable as possible. I also cant tell you how many times I have been killed with little to no gear on me and those types of people will you know act all friendly they will revive you give you some gear and right when you are free to go just shoot you in the back of the head just to pi$$ you off more and make you even more miserable. There are also dominant alpha clans in this game that can go up to dozens upon dozens of players and obviously no matter how hard you try you cant defend a raid against 20 people or defend yourself. But they will still pull sh*t like I just said before or they will just bm you into the ground because they know its unfair and they just want to- once again, pi$$ you off even more. It is the absolute worst feeling in the world when everything youve ever built/collected gets taken because of an unfair advantage and it is just shoved in your face. If you get killed your get trash talked, if you manage to kill someone you get trash talked because just because you killed them you are a \"pu$$y\" for whatever reason they may state. Whatever happens you experience bm, toxicity, and trash talking. And I mean it varies from person to person on how much bm bother you but to me maybe it happening occasionally would be kinda discouraging and a little rage inducing, but after it happens again and again for me anyways it really gets f*cking annoying and ruins the game in just another way.\n\nLack of Balancing/Clan Dominance:\nI mentioned the clan a little in that past statement but honestly not even close to enough. This right here I would choose as Rust biggest con, the clan dominance in this game is absolutely absurd and it can not be understated in anyway whatsoever. As I mentioned there can be clans upwards of 20+ people and you cannot do anything against that unless you have 20+ people yourself, and that is not a common privilege that most people can get in this game. It doesnt matter how good of a base you think you have, how good of gear you think you have, if there are 20 people shooting rockets at your base, spoiler alert, you are going to f*cking die and your base is going to get torn to shreds.

doesn't even want to load. Once you get into the game you have to go through a series of constant freezing, and lagging for 30 minutes or more. When you try to use something that you haven't used when you got into the game ex: the microphone. The game has to freeze for that too. It's completely understandable as to why this game takes so long to load, and process everything. However, Ark has bigger maps, a lot more things to load in, and even more commands and items. So why does that game take way less time to load, and doesn't have players go through so much lag, and loading? \n\nNot only that, but when you try making a base lets say you mess up on a wall, or foundation placement, or something of that sort. You have to waste so much time and resources to break the thing you just placed down to correct your error, or just have to deal with it. \n\nAnd lastly, the game's logic. I was playing it a bit ago and was traveling around in the safe zone after grabbing a supply crate and was in the safe zone to check out what awesome loot I gained from it. I lagged not even half way through the safe zone, and ran into a wild dog. I had to run outside the safe zone till it no longer said \"safe zone\" on the bottom left hand corner of the screen, so I did. Once I saw that I wasn't in the safe zone anymore I had shot the wild creature with the loot I got, and was shot and killed by the turrets within the safe zone. If you're not allowed to defend yourself from being attacked, then why spawn in dangerous creatures in the safe zone? So I sucked it up and went back to the safe zone to get my loot back, and was shot and killed the safe zone turrets each time I came back to retrieve my stuff (3 times.)", "timestamp_created": 1551596736, "timestamp_updated": 1551596736, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49061760": {"recommendationid": "49061760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059439228", "num_games_owned": 276, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 1117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550440232}, "language": "english", "review": "Rampant hackers, toxic people that keep killing nakeds despite them being end-game, and a time waster in general.\n\nOnly play this if you love the things above.", "timestamp_created": 1550440328, "timestamp_updated": 1550440328, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537390172481536865", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48842634": {"recommendationid": "48842634", "author": {"steamid": "76561198821193325", "num_games_owned": 161, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 5508, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546968482}, "language": "english", "review": "It can be fun but the community at large is the textbook definition of the word toxic so beware.

When I roam I only bring what I expect I could lose. But the community is SO TOXIC! It's like the community somehow crossbred extreme mic spamming REETERS with basement dwelling neckbeards and made them all 12 years old. THEY AREN'T EVEN HUMAN ANYMORE! Sometimes I swear if I heard one of these cancers coming up to me in game screeching and then I heard a gunshot then silence from their microphone, I would laugh.\n\nThen there's the complete opposite. I was raiding a small wooden door base at some point when there weren't many people on and someone came up to me. It was dark so I dove out of the light from the incendiary shotgun rounds, but he killed me. He told me I could come back and get my stuff in chat, which surprised me. He said he was bored, so he took me to his base, gave me a pistol and said \"Let's go raiding.\" We ran around the map for a few hours and broke into a couple of places before he said he was tired and I could have everything on him since he could rebuild the stuff easily. You don't get this kind of thing in other games. It's pretty awesome.\n\nHowever, I realized something a little while later, this game was super addicting, and I was playing so long I realized I wasn't having fun. I was getting obsessed over defense and getting the higher tier gear. I was moving to the most remote location I could find and setting up a costly base that I would have to maintain daily and it would still crumble to anyone with enough rockets. I realized that I had been wasting my time and not having those fun and random interactions, I was desperately trying to create something that could be so easily lost and the only thing that spurred me on was the idea of all the loot I would be able to get. But what would happen when I got there? Once I had the best armor, guns, and rockets all I would do is become like one of those roaming bands of assholes that go around killing anyone they see because there's nothing left to gain besides more of what you already have. I decided to uninstall after I'd stayed up far too late just mining nodes and smelting metal for a base and realized I was bored.\n\nOf course before I did that I despawned everything in my base so no assholes would get them ;)\n\nTLDR: The game has great aspects to it, it's very addictive, the community is toxic as hell, it drives you to try to gain more and more but once you have it there ain't SHIT to do.", "timestamp_created": 1551178125, "timestamp_updated": 1551178125, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519685029983520508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49362745": {"recommendationid": "49362745", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087896737", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 21921, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1551744211}, "language": "english", "review": "Had this game from the very beginning.

It was pretty fun. You could explore, build weird stuff, people you met were friendly and would help you. The devs were clearly inspired by STALKER and STALKER was awesome. I grew nostalgic recently so I reinstalled it to check out the progress, which brings me to two reasons why you should never buy this game:\n\n1)absolute lack of any goal while the sandbox elements are heavily restricted: When I played the game at the beginning, there was not a whole lot to do in the world, but it was excusable because of early access. Now, YEARS LATER, there is still nothing to do! You just gather resources, visit the same places where boxes spawn and fight over them. Rinse and repeat. There is nothing to do, nothing that would push you to cooperate with anyone, no challange to overcome once you craft some stuff, literally nothing. You just shoot everyone you see, and since the mechanics are pretty clunky compared to games where shooting each other was the whole point, you are left with a subpar shooter with some building elements, which are also unrewarding because you can't just set out to build anything ambitious unless you want to log in every hour to collect resources so that your base doesn't decay. That's just busywork and it is boring as hell. No aspect of the gameplay is implemented in a fun way, even though they sound like they should be.\n\n2)The community: I play LoL so I know what toxic means, but the level of griefing and toxicity in Rust is staggering. To be fair, I can't blame the players since, as I wrote, THERE IS NOTHING ELSE TO DO! So within a few hours after a wipe, there will be a ton of people who already have assault rifles and use them without warning on anyone they see, even if you spawned 5 minutes ago and have only stone tools an 200 wood. So you will die. A lot. For no reason and with no gain to the person who killed you, which is the very definition of griefing, and it happens on every server.\n\nI really want to like this game. I have spent a lot of time in it and can handle my own in a fight, but every time i start anew, the best part of any game imo, it's like pulling teeth. You build the same shack, collect the same materials, die to the same griefers, kill some people, and then... That's it. Nothing else. It's the Battle Royale version of a crafting game.\n\nTLDR: lack of content and true sandboxy freedom with the single worst community in any game I've played.

The BP systems isn't the greatest and can take a while to get what you need, but it works. Harvesting, building a base, exploring and having the occasional firefight is also fun (talking about when i started 3 years ago)\nThe game looks good, runs well and have very frequent updates - 3 years on. \n\nThe one reason why I would not recommend this game is due to the community. It is by far the worst community i've had the misfortune of experiencing - ALTHOUGH, I have met a handful of decent players.\n\nWhen I started out 3 years ago it seemed quite different. Over time it has just gotten worse and worse, and it really makes the whole experience frustrating and unenjoyable.\nYou used to be able to mill about, collect reasources, build a base and get going without too much of an issue. The people you would come across would, more often than not, be friendly and leave you to your own devices. Of coure you would get the occasional hostile, but it generally wasn't that bad.\n\nUnfortunately, now it is a much different story. 99/100 people will kill you on sight, even if it is within seconds of respawning... they will also often flame you out over the mic. I've heard every insult, racial slur and homophobic insult many times, every play session.\nThe trend at the moment is to greet you, tell you about how they are friendly, wait for you to let your guard down and then kill you. Many players will scream about being friendly and then kill you straight after. \nFor the record I am one of the few friendly players in the game, but it gets very wearing after a while when everyone just wants to pretend to be friendly, kill you and then insult you over the mic.\n\nYes, I expect to get killed, raided etc in rust, but dont expect it every 2 minutes. It's not fun. I cannot imagine how new players will even begin to get to grips with rust - you simple do not have enough time from spawning to learn. I've seen quite a few get completely disheartened and quite on their first server.\nRust is not a \"pure pvp csgo cod shooter\", yet so many players seem to treat it like it is.\nI like to play games to have fun, and rust was... once upon a time. Just not anymore. \n\nThere is no penalty for running around and being an anti-social, toxic, idiot. This is a major flaw within a game like this. You can run around insulting, trolling and greifing as much as you like, along with forgetting how to interact with another humans in a normal way and nothing will ever happen. Rack up millions of kos kills, nothing happens.\nJust because I play a game like rust doesn't mean I have lose all sense of decency when I interact with people. Yet 99% of players do and it is incredibly sad.\n\nThere is a reason the community on rust is shrinking. It needs to be addressed as rust is a good game...without 99% of the other players.\n\nPeople who read this review can tell me to 'get gud' as much as the like, or whatever insults you have stored up your sleeves, but at the end of the day there comes a point where the toxicity becomes too much and it's just not fun... Welcome to Rust.\n\nIt's a shame I cannot recommend rust as it is up there with being one of my favourites. The community has just sucked out the last bit of fun for me.\n\nEdit - Im not against the idea of rust (included raiding, fighting etc etc etc). Im solely talking about the players and how they interact with you.

Normally, anyone you meet with any type of weapon will be hostile. You'll even see nakeds fight you with their rock when you spawn.\n\n[b]PLAY WITH FRIENDS[/b]: Can't emphasise this enough. Having atleast one other person to play with is all you need. There are a lot of responsibilities you have as a rust player and it will be twice as easy and twice as fast to do it with a duo partner.\n\n[b]YOU WILL DIE[/b]: You will die with all the loot in the world, many, many, times. Even more so if you try to play solo.

I had initially spotted him pretty far away, but I paid no real notice to him as he had a rock equipped. Eventually he got close enough for us to clearly see each other and, upon the realization that neither of us were hostile, we both pulled out torches as a mutual sign of peace (or the highest possible level of non-aggression that can exist in Rust). I dropped my old hatchet for him as I had just finished crafting one with metal, and he gave me some food as a sign of good faith. After nearly 30 minutes of searching and scavenging, we had pooled enough resources to craft us each some minimally decent gear. We knew that if we wanted to progress any further we would need to mine boulders, and a lot of them. I used what remaining materials we had to put together a 9mm handgun and several bullets, though I reminded him it was only in case we really needed it. I had decided earlier during my many unwanted experiences with bullets to the face that I would try my hardest not to run around slaughtering every newly spawned player that I came across. A few minutes out from camp we had encountered a player with a hunting bow. I had been running with my hatchet out, so I quickly took out the handgun in my inventory and pointed it in his direction, attempting to scare him away. When the player was far enough away we continued up a road towards a few stones. The area was surrounded by trees so I opted to stand guard with the handgun while my friend mined. Just as we were moving on to the next boulder, I heard the gunfire start. I turned around to see a player with an assault rifle gunning down my friend, and before I could land any shots on him he had already begun shooting me. It was at that moment that I remembered I hadn't even crafted a sleeping bag for the camp, as that was one of the objectives of the trip we were taking. I typed into the chat, thanking the friend I had made for all of his help and asking the player who had killed us if we had been intruding in his area or something along those lines. He simply wrote \"Sorry guys :D\" This is the single problem that I have with games like this. Why does it have to be \"shoot-on-sight?\" That player had obviously taken us by surprise and was better equipped than us. Even if he had a justifiable reason for approaching two very poorly equipped players (which he really didn't considering we were in the middle of the woods and he had pretty much all of the gear you could need in this game) he could have easily told us to cooperate by either putting away our weapons or just leaving the area. But of course, he comes around, sees some players trying to gather enough supplies to get to a stable point in the game, and decides to go out of his way to approach us and use unecessary ammo for a hatchet and a handgun with four bullets. Then, to add even more of an insult, he adds an apology at the end, as if he had no choice but to shoot two unexpecting, half-naked, unprepared players. \n\nAll in all, though, I do see a lot of potential in this game, and the good in the community does shine through every once in a while. I just wish that people would realize that they don't need to go around killing players who haven't had the chance to experience the game.

[/h1]\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]General game information [/b][/h1]\n\nThis game is a great example of a survival sandbox game. You can literaly do whatever the hell you wanna do. Do you wanna roleplay? Go for it. Do you wanna build stuff and let your creative mind blow of some steam? Go for it. Do you wanna murder another player in cold blood with your trusted rock? Go for it.\n\nObviously there are populair ways (PVP) to play the game but when you spawn in this game.. naked and along on a beach.. armed with a rock and torch.. with nothing holding you back.. you will realise why you woke up on the beach in the first place.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]My experience [/b][/h1]\n\nAt the time of writing this review i've been playing this game for years. It started out with a mate of mine buying the game. I was watching him through some streaming software and I thought it looked fun. So I bought it.\nAfter figuring out the basics of crafting and resource gathering the two of us started building a wonderful base. That base lasted for a full hour. Then we were severly punished for the flaws in our design by a more experienced player. This happened over and over and over and over again. At this point a lot of people lose interest in the game, I didn't.\nFor some reason I was determined to learn from my previously made mistakes and improve on them.\nThis resulted in over 1800 hours of gameplay. 1800 of GLORIOUS hours. But like I said earlier, this game isn't for the feint of heart.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]State of the Game [/b][/h1]\n\nWhen you invest a little into this game physically and emotionally.. you will run into people referring to \"Legacy\" being the best state of the game, I disagree.\nThe current version of Rust is a combination of two previously tested systems of the game.\nThese are named: [b]The Blueprint system + The component system[/b].\nMost Rust players will tell you that the blueprint system was the best system this game has ever seen. Over the last few years them tried different systems which generally didn't get any love.\nA week ago (at the time of me posting this review) They revamped the system to the one I mentioned earlier.\n[b]The Blueprint system + The component system[/b] - Aka the best system Rust has ever seen + new features of older failed systems revamped.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]The pros [/b][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]If you use a microphone, you will have the most fun and random interactions you have ever experienced.\n[*]There's a lot of ways to express your creativity. Basebuilding, gearsets, drawing penisses on other peoples bases.\n[*]There is no real endgame, so you can set your own goals. Trust me when I say that those can be very rewarding.\n[*]Its a great game for Youtube content (has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.)\n[*]Its a great game for Twitch content (has a streamer mode to hide from streamsnipers, has profanity filter, auto censoring nudes ect.)\n[*]As a big community that really loves the game, but for the most part is filled with toxic players. (Like any other game these days)\n[*]The game is constantly being developed. Weekly changes+additions with every patch.\n[*]The game also has a great Dev team, they are hardworking and very dedicated\n[/list]\n\n[h1][b]The cons [/b][/h1]\n[list]\n[*]It has a big learning curve. The first thing you need to do is join a empty server and start figuring stuff out cause on a populated server you will get punished for it.\n[*]A lot of people KoS in the current state of the game, which is fine for me cause im used to it. But if you are new it can be very offputting.\n[*]The game has a very annoying memoryleak that will cause problems no matter how much GB you got in that godlike computer of yours. (they are working on it)\n[*]Deciding on the correct server for you to join will directly affect how much fun the game is for you as a soloplayer.\n[*]The official servers are terrible. There is hardly ever a admin in there to counteract a possible cheater. My advice: Stick to the community servers.\n[*]The game uses a day/night cycle. During the night it truly is pitchblack and you wont be able to see a thing. Unless you have Nvidia, then you can just fire up the gamma and you'll be fine. Especially vs people that have a AMD graphics card. Its a annoying problem in the game thats currently being looked into.\n[/list]\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]The future isn't set in stone. [/b][/h1]\n\nWell, sorta. If you take a look at the facepunch website you will be able to see a roadmap. On this roadmap you will be able to find features and fixes they lined up for the game. Some will be added shortly and some will probably never see the light of day. Keep in mind the game is currently still early access and might change drasticly in a year. I've seen the game go through 3-4 different systems now. And all of them had fun aspects and negative ones.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]Conclusion [/b][/h1]\n\nIf you are still interested after reading all this, definately buy the game. Over the years of me playing Rust, I've had the most interesting interactions and the most fun experiences ive ever had in a game.\n_______________________________\n\n[h1][b]Side note [/b][/h1]\n\nI'm working on a really big tutorial for this game.

Then I watched two other players club each other to death with large stones, while completely naked, penises (penii?) dangling in the wind. Having managed to slay a small pig, I fashioned some clothes to cover my genitals, then went exploring.\n\nAte some uncooked meat and threw up all over the place. Made a small fire to cook the rest of my meat. Fashioned a bow and arrow out of some wood I collected, also a shirt and a pair of boots. Went about fashioning a small shelter out of some random crap laying around so I wouldn't have to sleep outdoors. I could have chosen from one of the many, many, ramshackle structures dotting the landscape. But those may or may not belong to/contain other players. Who may or may not be armed or clothed. I just wanted to peacefully live alone, so I stuck to the wilderness.\n\nI slipped off a cliff and broke both my legs. I shouted out to anyone who would listen, asking what to do to fix my broken legs, I didn't understand the game and I needed help. A naked man came over, typed '??? i help' in response to my pleas, then bashed my head in with a rock and presumably looted my corpse.\n\nThen I starved to death when I forgot to eat. Out of desperation I butchered a wolf that attacked me instead of running away, but didnt have time to cook so I ate raw meat again. Nope. Instead of just starving to death, I vomited, then starved to death.\n\nIts now 7:25 am and many adventures later, I've decided to sleep in a small shack I made myself in the mountains.

You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island.

Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax; enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame.

Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored, maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design, or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings, but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance, so when you're spotted by an idiot, you'll start hearing the shit-talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer, they get louder and more confident, and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.\n\nIt's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it.

Rust can sometimes feel very slow pace on the official servers, so If you want to quickly build and join in on the action, id suggest a modded server with faster crafting and gathering. Overall, if you have the money, i'd suggest looking into buying this game.

(Essentially cheating in everything in the very beginning of a campaign. It just ruins the experience)\n\nTHE SCRAP GRIND \n-scrap grind isn\u2019t necessarily that bad, but expiramenting on workbenches is awful\n- there are 3 tiers of workbenches:\nLevel 1 has simple blueprints (cheap revolvers, ghetto shotguns, regular pistol bullets, simple stuff, unreliable explosives) \nLevel 2 has higher tier blueprints (smgs, better pistols, semi auto rifles, better armor)\nLevel 3 is the endgame workbench with the best loot. (AK, explosive ammo, c4, rockets, rocket launchers, metal armor, sniper rifle) \nIn the game there is expiramenting on the workbench, where you can get a blueprint that you don\u2019t already have. This system for as it is is a gamble, and it\u2019s pretty good for the lower level benches. Only 75 scrap for the level 1, and it\u2019s actually pretty good for its price. If you don\u2019t have the revolver (probably one of the most important guns in the beginning of the wipe) you can get the revolver, and then research the bullets that come with it. With the level 2 it is still pretty much worth it to expirament. Getting a semi rifle can really bridge the gap for you from being primal to getting good loot. The level 3 expiramenting is very iffy however. You can get really good items like the AK, bolt action sniper, metal chest plate and mask, etc. Researching on the level 3 is super high risk high reward. You on one hand have the possibility of getting an AK, one of the most powerful weapons in the game, or you can get incendiary 5.56 (rifle ammo that is stupid expensive, and nobody uses it) and you need to nearly get another level 3 workbenches worth of scrap to do it. \n\n\nTHE PVP \n-Where do I start. PvP is awful on this game. \n-god awful stuttering, even with very good PCs\n-pvp favors the client side, instead of serverside \n\nLet\u2019s say you are watching someone go across an open field and suddenly they stop, great time to tap them right? Wrong. They for 1:\nAren\u2019t frozen\nAre yards ahead of what you see\nMost likely already killing you.\nPROJECTILE_INVALID Is your number one enemy while pvping\n\nBASES \n- Nothing bad I can really bash this game about on their building side. The roof is just one big problem they need to get rid of completely \n-decay isn\u2019t a problem unless you\u2019re a 1 man inside a 10 man sized base \n-high external walls are a good way to scare people off; show that you mean business.\n\nRAIDING\n-three different kinds of raiding \n-onlining is pretty much only to prove a point. It is inferior to offlining, but it\u2019s the gentleman\u2019s way of doing it. It\u2019s essentially impossible to succeed in, unless only a few are online and you are chocked full of explosives. The defenders can just build a wall and metal all your hard work in less than a second (seriously)\n-offlining is the safer way to do it, but less noble way. You do this if you want loot. Nobody to defend the base, should be smooth sailing. The only problem are the counter raiders.\n-raiding for the sake of being an asshole. These raiders grief bases. The place metal walls in inconvenient places, they wall off doorways, destroy workbenches. Please don\u2019t do this.\n\n\nDEFENDING YOUR BASE\n-Rust is actually stressful, like seriously.\n-you spend hours defending your base to make sure it doesn\u2019t get offlined\n- you wake up thinking \u201cI really hope I haven\u2019t gotten offlined\u201d\n-you stay up late to make sure nobodies schemin\u2019\n-it overall takes a toll on your sleep schedule, and it\u2019s more of a chore to play rust than it is a treat.\n\nHOW THE GAME WORKS \nThe game is essentially like life. The harder you work in the begging, the better your life is in the end. \nIf you grind all day every day in the beginning of wipe, you can spend your final days in rust not worrying about scrap, upkeep, etc. You can just raid and pvp. \nI\u2019m too lazy to finish this review, I\u2019ll do it later.

I got frustrated or raged in games before but I have never had a big adrenalin rush before or had a cocktail of many different feelings in a game before. The first week of Rust burned into my memory, remembering running scared and losing myself in the game, it was too much. It was a Love & Hate, for which I kept coming back. You can become a hero or rich in a second and lose it all in another second and you can become the villain you despised so much. You will meet horrible people and great ones. With Rust, my game expectations changed so much that I can't play single-player games for very long now.

I was naked.\n\nI ran around, looking for a fellow survivor. After an hour, I saw him. I yelled at him as loud as I could, and he turned around. \n\nWe greeted each other, and agreed to work together.\n\nAfter a few days, we'd built a house, and had enough supplies to last a week. We had weapons, food and water. Life was good.\n\nOne day, on our daily raid, we spotted someone. He was naked, and ran towards us. He greeted us, we greeted him back, and he and I started a conversation. Suddenly, my friend pulls me back and whispers to me. He said we should kill him. Survival of the fittest.\n\nI looked back at the innocent man and gave him my pickaxe and told him to leave. My friend sighed, and gave him some clothes. He thanked us, and left. \n\nThe next day, he appears again, to say thanks, and that he has a gang as well, so that we could join him. We kindly refused. He sounded a bit agitated, but he said no problem, and left.\n\nLater that night, I hear footsteps outside our house. My friend was fast asleep, so I grabbed my homemade shotgun and looked outside.\n\nIt was the man. The man who we gave a pickaxe to. He was inspecting our house with someone else, but quickly left after he saw a bear running towards him.\n\nThe next morning, I woke up my friend and told him what happened. He told me I shouldn't have trusted him, and that war is coming.\n\nI was raiding an old town, when suddenly on top of a hill in the distance, I saw him. Although this time, he had his gang. There were a lot of them. About 10-20. My friend noticed this as well, and told me to get inside. We got inside, and it was quiet for about an hour. My friend and I go outside, and see them waiting.\n\nThey said that they were friendly, but we didn't trust them. My friend and I got out our shotguns and told them to leave. They didn't listen. \n\nThen the war began.\n\nThey got out guns and shot at us, firing at all directions. My friend got hit, and yelled at me to get inside and lock the door. My friend barely got inside, but when he did, it was already to late- they were inside.\n\nLuckily, we had a panic room for this kind of situation. It had an iron door, which could only be broken down by C4. We rushed down there as the scavengers began to search our house.\n\nAfter a few minutes, they'd discovered we were in the panic room, so they began swinging at it with the pickaxe I gave them. It didn't work. When suddenly, I heard a boom. They had C4.\n\nMy friend and I discussed what we should do. We agreed that when we get taken hostage, we run like hell.\n\nThey eventually got in, took all of our gear, and we were naked again. They were about to execute us when suddenly, my friend got up and began to run. He ran as fast as the wind would take him. They missed every shot they took at him, so I decided I had nothing to lose, so I ran as well. \n\nIt was pitch black outside. I felt around and felt a bush, so I hid in there. In the distance, I could see torches everywhere. My friend saved my life, but the enemy was searching for him. There was nothing I could do, so I ran off, and began my new life.\n\nTo this day, I don't know what my friend is doing. Dead or alive, he's a hero.

I told myself I would wait to do this review, that I would let it settle, that it would one day be finished and then I could write my thoughts. Well, too much time has passed for me to wait any longer, and for some reason, today seems to be the day.\n\nI'm not even sure now how I discovered this, \"new game with a cool idea\". A friend, DayZ-exploring, a flashing Steam store page, who knows. But once I installed it, and loaded it up, I had found a new, exciting video game. The music when loading was incredible, eerie and atmospheric; and this was 'alpha' music? Once I loaded into the world, an island of apparent great size, I enjoyed the experience from the start. Nature, trees, vast distances, animals, ruins, and...people.\n\nFor that is what makes Rust tick, people. The first moment, not knowing whether to hide, fight, or try to communicate, is telling, and this is a common thread. And with these first moments, come the first deaths, both expected and not. And so comes the first rule of Rust, don't trust anyone. And with this rule comes the choice you have to make, do you strive to live a solo life? Do you have Steam friends that play and can band together? Or do you try to find some team to take you in? Be ready, you are going to die, a lot.\n\nI made a shelter, and built, and harvested, and hunted. I ventured into dangerous places and survived. Or died. In the end, it was a great experience. Then came the version changes, at first it was good, bugs were fixed. Then, they started over from scratch, and things started getting different from what made it good in the first place. It was good, then bad, then good, then bad.\n\nThe game today is worse than it was, a new thing we are seeing in games when they are made to be a service. A game with a golden age, something we used to only see in MMOs. That is why I can no longer recommend this game. I am going to give it a thumbs up, because of my experiences, and that it was worth the money I paid, but now is a different time. Rust is over for me.\n\nGraphics: \nApart from certain updates and small periods, Rust has always looked fantastic. As they moved into Beta and the modern Rust era, the game both looks great, and takes a great system to run. It's one of the games that gets my PC as hot as it can get. Beware!\n\nSound:\nGreat music and sounds at first, but inconsistent sound production. Seemed like the staff never settled on consistant sounds/music during the process. To me, this shows a lack of focus, which has been clear from every player since the beta started. This developmental blurriness seems to coincide with when Rust had already made huge sales. Pretty much the team had success, and just went in slow-patch mode. It was less about a work of art, a work that could have defined the team of producers and developers for the rest of their lives, and more about making the project akin to updating the software in automatically flushing toilets.\n\nCommunity:\nIt's a multiplayer game, and the community can be tight-knit if you're in good, but overall it's as toxic as it gets. The sadness with Rust comes from both the community and the developers. Nobody is happy, ever. This has bred conflict between players I've never witnessed before. In short, Rust has the worst community of players I have ever seen, and the clear lack of maturity in most players is almost depressing.\n\nOverall: \nRust was a pioneer, a flagship in a tattered lot, but what made it great also destroyed it. When new games are made in it's shadow, I hope that someone can capture that essence just once again, and hold it tight until a perfect time to share it with the world.", "timestamp_created": 1504903002, "timestamp_updated": 1542861469, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 198, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.896935462951660156", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48404710": {"recommendationid": "48404710", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046177475", "num_games_owned": 81, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 47302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545633986}, "language": "english", "review": "it's time to upgrade your game trailer bois", "timestamp_created": 1547831885, "timestamp_updated": 1547831885, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 211, "votes_funny": 56, "weighted_vote_score": "0.885839760303497314", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32119576": {"recommendationid": "32119576", "author": {"steamid": "76561198188724699", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 14277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546559916}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

NOTE that I have 1500 hours put into this game on my main account plus a few more on this account so im a long time rust player. Now on to my story and experience.\n\n\nMONTH 1-2\n\nThere i was in the open field trying to figure out how to craft and make stuff. First shack I built I thought I was safe, no I was just a prey for players. They tore my shack down and told me if I wanted a room. Without clear thinking i said yes and soon after they trapped me in there house and I was made a slave. I joined another server and with a minutes I made myself a pipe-shotgun wooo!!!. As I went to farm i noticed 3 guys loaded with gear and heavy artillery. I thought this was a caveman game with no high tech weaponry, nope i was wrong when they shot that bullet in my face. Though i loved everything this game had going. A week passes and I find a hidden somewhat made base and without thinking again make my room right on top and start farming and making new things. Next day I wake up to find 2 guys building on top of the base I made and we have a short stare until they said they are sorry. They thought the base was abandoned. As I return from my farming routine I find a player stealing my stuff from the bottom part which I was going to use. His name was lunch  I took it to shoot him right away, but he shuts the door and managed to stay safe. We soon talked it out and made an agreement not to shoot each other. I trusted him and that was the start of a new friendship.\n\n\nMONTH 2-3\n\nMy roomates on top dissapeared out of nowhere and in the end it was me and lunch. We did what any rust player does survive and find new things to make. Then we found a player named tanaka. He was a fellow rust player and could make bolt rifles so we made a deal to offer a trade. after the trade me and lunch were thinking, shoot...kill... I chose not to shoot him. The three of us form an alliance and go out hunting for people and yes its the most fun satisfying thing in RUST and I hate it. Everything was perfect until we encountered them. A hacker out of nowhere aimbotted us and from then on we were careful to go outside with valuable stuff because you never know when they will decide to aimbot you. That didn't stop me and lunch until a hacker found our base one day. Turned out he was a little boy and wanted our codes to our house. We said no and he aimbotted us and destroyed everything we had and took so long farming for. That is when we decided to go to a community server as we said bye to the rust players and tanaka.\n\n\nMONTH 3-4\n\nNothing much to say but we just enjoyed our new rust community hacker free or so we thought. Even though there are admin there is a 50% chance that there is a hacker hiding his hacks or clipping inside houses when admin is gone. It was a fun time as me and lunch made new friends and enemies. Though as time went on less players showed up and thats when my good friend lunch left the game RUST. There i was alone but couldn't leave this damn game as i loved it so much. Yes i went back to the official servers and once started from scratch, or so i thought....\n\n\nMONTH 4-9\n\nThere i spawned i saw the one person i remembered, the one I didn't shoot, the one me and lunch hunted with. Tanaka{Robin}. He offered me a bed and my own room and we chatted for awhile and thus i told him about lunch . Days went to weeks and weeks went to months and slowly me and robin were building more bases and trusting each other with our items. We decided to spend all our wood on at the hanger and thus in a few weeks the batcave was born. During these times i also gained reputation good and bad. Most loved me and I made more friends who would later help me with my enemies. Those that were my enemies called me nothing but a low hacker hiding my hacks. My other sort of rival to own lands was a clan named RST and a few encounters i had with them i shot without any say. Then came another man who i would get to know more as the days went one. His name was doc baby muncher. I didn't really talk to him that much but enjoyed his say when a plane dropped an airdrop. ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Me and robin didn't see him that much as he was in the other side of the map but he was an enjoyment. Everything was normal each day in RUST. Nakeds players, friends, hackers and more. FYI Doc refers the nakeds as hobos. Even later I slowly made friends with RST and respected them. REP(incinerator,pie,maddy). Then the horrible day came as me and robin encountered the servers first wipe.\n\n\nMonth 9-11\n\nMy love for Rust didn't make me leave,which i hate. NO, instead i went to another server and Rst was nice enough to lend me a small room. Heck i even saw doc and his ZE PLANE ZE PLANE. Robin was with me but made a different base and in that short time EA3 was back and everybody returned. Though not everybody I once knew were there as some of my friends and allies left Rust. It wasn't long until Yes even Robin left right when the server came back up. You will be missed. Thus it was me and my rock. Though there i was addicted to this damn game playing and playing. The batcave was rebuilt,hackers were doubling and players started to vanish because of hackers. there i went solo for a while then one day Doc visited my base and introduced my to Mr ROtten. We went out to kill hobos and later i gave them a guest room. I enjoyed their company and they are one main reason why i stayed in rust more. From friendly player i was turned into an asshat, No we turned to ZE Asshats. I trusted even more and gave them the codes to my entire batcave and so came the chapter of me and the asshats. Then out of nowhere it came again, dam servers.\n\n\nMONTH 11-PRESENT\n\nNew server new fresh start and new players. Me Doc and Rotten made a T tower and do what we do best which is snipe hobos. Its been a year and few months now and i'm slowly players are coming back though i'm not sure ill stay here any longer. I've been raided,c4ed, no clipped, befriended, Shot etc.. I have raided, killed, c4ed, and have done it all. I know every trick that rust has and still could possibly learn more things. RUST is a game that shows how you feel about players and what you are willing to do to survive. Rust has one main story and that is your story. I love this and and hate it at the same time. I will never forget how many friends i have made and friends that have left me. who knows i might have an encounter  with them again. This is my Story and history in RUST. I hope you will give this game a chance as developers are even making a new RUST. Thankyou and remember the name of the game is RUST not TRUST(sometimes).\n\nYar....\n", "timestamp_created": 1417750018, "timestamp_updated": 1417750018, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 612, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.895519495010375977", "comment_count": 45, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "38886280": {"recommendationid": "38886280", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034367764", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 252292, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550433944}, "language": "english", "review": "After nearly 3,500 hours I finally decided to review one of my favorite games on PC. In fact, it was the reason why I bought a gaming PC in the first place.\n\nPros:\n- RAIDING - Raiding other groups, clans, or enemies provided me with many hours of tactical, engaging, and intense fights. It is one of the core aspects of the game, and is what kept me hooked for so long.\n\n- PVP -Rust is one of those rare games that gets your heart rate pumping after killing a couple of enemies, and trying to loot all of their bodies while zig zagging your way to safely deposit your loot back home. All while your hands are shaking.\n\n- BUILDING - The way that people build bases is constantly being changed through certain forced updates. You used to be able to build huge castles and compounds, but now the game has switched to a more bunker base style build. This change in style every once in a while is refreshing in the form of you aren't seeing the same base build over and over again from YouTube tutorials.\n\n- ROLEPLAY - Facepunch has implemented many items that encourage friendly player to player interaction. From shop fronts and vending machines, to mailboxes and notes, and to the new furniture being added to the game, there is certainly a place for your casual gamer. \n\nCons:\nDon't get this game if you won't treat it like a full time job. You will be disappointed every time you login to find that your base has been raided by a bunch of high schoolers who can spend almost 12 hours a day on the game.\n\nUnfortunately, many Rust players are way too serious about their loot. Meaning, they would rather offline raid a base in 30 minutes, than be challenged in an online raid that provides multiple hours of fun for both sides. Also, a lot of shit talking and bragging about loot in the public chat.\n\nHackers, scripters, and ban evaders are everywhere.\n\nFPS Stutters. The game on the highest setting looks beautiful, but expect to take a huge performance hit once you are in a gunfight. I run on potato settings with a high end PC to make sure I don't dip to 10 fps if I get in a big gunfight.\n\nOverall, the gameplay in Rust is extremely addicting and you forget what time it is in real life while playing. However, the fact that you have to treat this game like a full-time job and the terrible performance hits is what will kill the game. Still, it remains my favorite.\n", "timestamp_created": 1514689906, "timestamp_updated": 1514689906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 254, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.910206794738769531", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "44870679": {"recommendationid": "44870679", "author": {"steamid": "76561198218365697", "num_games_owned": 28, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 138890, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549598566}, "language": "english", "review": "good game toxic communities", "timestamp_created": 1537616837, "timestamp_updated": 1537616837, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 178, "votes_funny": 57, "weighted_vote_score": "0.872375965118408203", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9277608": {"recommendationid": "9277608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198056463531", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1550, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1512468050}, "language": "english", "review": "I met a man who helped me with my adventures.

Ha Rust.\n\nI love this game, or rather I *loved* it.\n\nThe game itself is amazing, great fun especially on some servers with active admins and sensible mods. The dev's are incredibility active with weekly updates, and the extended community of streamers and content creators is what made my attracted to the game in the first place. \n\nBut the community. The community is toxic as hell. What started as a great game with amazing player interactions, the struggle to build and survive and even creating groups of players who previously didn't know each other. It was great. Now, its all about the PvP. Shoot on sight is the order of the day, and with the exception of RP servers, which are modded and have more rules than the tax man, player interactions are now simply \"Shoot first, loot after\". No talking, no making friends or meeting the neighbours. Constant  screaming or music blasting from local talk, and frankly I don't understand how anyone plays on high population servers without getting a headache. If you're not in a clan, you're not worth worrying about.\n\nAnd developers; please, please, stop listening to Reddit. Its like a bunch of 13 year olds got together to pester you into creating CoD with buildings. That's not what made or makes Rust great. Those people are runing your game; some of your more recent changes are great, but still penalise solo players in favor of larger groups or zergs. \n\nI'm recommending the game in the vain hopes the community gets better (or the toxic morons move on to another game).

It started as a faster pace version of the game (mod) i love Dayz or well the Arma Operation arrow head version. \n\nEven though the game started as of what even garry Newman (the creator) said \"a clone of dayz and STALKER\" It has over the years turned in to something MUCH more. Rust in the start was the first game when it was only accessable to youtubers and other known people that i wanted to get into and when i finally got in to it damn i was hooked. \n\n\n\nEver since the start i poured hours and hours in to the game loving every bit of it. I went from casually playing on the pc and more on Xbox too quitting on the consoles and playing PC. What im trying to say is that this game by a quite small developer team made me quit all other games to focus on this one.\n\n\n- The Game - \n\n\n\nAs refered to before, rust in the begining was a fast pace version of the arma mod (Dayz) with added features that had been missing like Base building and a way better combat system for gun-play. the focus of Rust was and is to build up your base and get \"loot\" and slowly climb from a primitive state to a more \"advanced\" state, aswell as pvp (player vs player) and raid you're enemies. Ofcouse thats my point of view and rust can be played however you like it farm, build, fight, make friends, \"role-play\" and much more. Thats the thing that makes this game so great, that you can really make it your own. \n\n\n- current farm/system- \n\nat the time of this \"review\" rust is in the component and bp system in witch you farm \"scrap\" aswell as find items in the wild to learn and then craft, this is imo the greatest change to the game it has made the early game alot slower then before, but not too slow like the XP system that was a few iterations back. It makes every item in the game feel more valuable and if you find that ak in a loot box you really care to get it back and it feels like a real loss if you loose it.\n\n\n\nin rust you have you're general farming system when it comes to get materials like stone and wood and ore. You hit trees, farm rocks or hit metal and sulfur nodes to get them, there has recently been added a quite nifty mini game to make farming more fun aswell!\n\n- the gun-mechanics - \n\n\nthe gun-mechanics of rust and gun-play aswell as general pvp feels fluid and smooth in general at this time and date some items do need rebalancing and changes but thats why its in a early access stage still, im talking at the moment about the general feel of everything.\n\nto compare rust to a few games i would say that rust is highly skill based like games like counterstrike, since they added spray patterns to alot of guns and generally removed alot of the aim cone issues (reduced) it feels like the gun play is really getting somewhere. all guns in the game have a durability before the break and different patterns, aswell as you need to craft your ammo , all the guns also carry out different stats that are suitable for different situations and cost a different amount in  materials to craft. This makes taking an \"ak\" out for instance will be better then a \"waterpipe shotgun\" but puts you in a higher risk of loosing alot more if you die. There is a WIDE variety of different weapons in the game, so you can really use what you prefer, like shooting a massive high damage high output machine gun?, like using primitive weapons like the bow or a spear? you can do that!\n\n-- Building--\n\nRust has one of the most simple but most advanced building systems i have ever seen in a game of this type.\n\nbasically you have a building plan and a hammer, the building plan is used for, well to plan out your building with \"twig\" (can also be used in raiding situations). when building you can map out how you want you're base with triangles and squares for the foundation, which might sound very limited but belive me its far from it. \n\nYou protect your base so other people cannot build and ruin it with a tool cupboard and can even put up traps and other items to make it safer. \n\nthere is 5 different tiers of materials you can use to make your base out of and you can mix and match them twig (only really used for mapping the base, since it can be broken really easily), Wood (used in the start (quite easy to get and is easy to break but still usable in the start)  , Stone ( a great material but has a soft side and a strong side), metal (is great has a soft and strong side like stone but is much stronger, weakness is that people can look trough the sides of it) and armoured (stronger then every other type and has no real downside except that its much more expensive). \n\n\n-- Raiding -- \n\nRaiding probably the biggest thing about this game. Raiding in rust is very interesting and its what brings the most crazy situations aswell as the most fun and sad ones. \n\nmost of the time when raiding your putting a lot on the line to get another group or persons stuff and sometimes house for your own. \n\nin rust there is a wide variety  of items to use just like the guns, you can use a rocket-launcher which has a high splash and damage rate which is the highest tier of raiding but is for the most part quite hard to come by in this current issue of rust, you also have C4, satchel charges explosive ammo and even things like the flamethrower, aswell as using items like pickaxes and melee weapons to break soft side of walls. \n\nwhen raiding you have the possibility to use ladders aswell as (currently) foundations and floors to get higher up on bases, there is also the possibility of \"boosting\" you're teammates by jumping on top of them. \n\n\n-- updates/devs/changes --\n\n\nI recently gave rust \"the labor of love\" nomination on steam because ever since the release of the game it has consistently gotten updated and improved and for a LONG while the game has gotten updated every week, the devs of the game always listen and for the better or worse looks to the player base to see what is wrong with the game and they are very active on social media. The dev team have their own dedicated site where they can be contacted and post frequent updates on what they are doing in the form of dev blogs.\n\n(not posting link since i dont know if that's allowed) \n\n\n- The issues - \n\n\nimma keep this section shor.\n\n\nThe only real issue with rust besides sometimes there being laggy servers and hit reg issues witch i dont really consider issues since i know they will be fixed before the game leaves early access.\n\nThe only and main issue is the life time of servers before the \"die\" most servers (it has gotten better and devs are aware) live for about 3-5 days before they start dying out. most people after the first few days just wait for the next update that's on thursday. \n\n-- conclusion -- \n\nThere is alot u haven't talked about thats in the game like how you can paint or that there soon* will be cars in it or that you can farm and forage and that is because i dont want to make this \"review\" longer then it has to be. I also want to make it clear that this is my point of view and that others may think different and have other opinions and that i might have missed things.\n\nWhen it comes down to the question should you get rust? in my opinion even though its a hard game to get into and also to get into if you are alone its an experience that i belive everyone should try aswell since its 50% off on steam atm! \n\n--\n\n\nif you have any questions or want more info feel free to add me! \n\ni also just wanna say sorry if i spelled alot wrong (im not a native english writer/speaker) \n\ni also wanted to say that even this might be a quite long review its noware near all the opinions and things i want to say.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1511764070, "timestamp_updated": 1511764070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 128, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.878110170364379883", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "8324694": {"recommendationid": "8324694", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072619002", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 6042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529696547}, "language": "english", "review": "Killed a deer got chicken meat out of it, BEST GAME EVER. 20/10", "timestamp_created": 1388122086, "timestamp_updated": 1388122086, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14828, "votes_funny": 62, "weighted_vote_score": "0.888511419296264648", "comment_count": 139, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29625347": {"recommendationid": "29625347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198033837251", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 38160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2988, "last_played": 1551763603}, "language": "english", "review": "I've had Rust for a week at the time of writing this review / guide. I have 50hrs at this point.\nWhat follows is a review of the various stages of your rust play-through, from wipe to wipe.\n\nIn the beginning:\n- You are given a randomly generated character, and spawn naked and afraid. \nI am a black male, finally I can use BBC in my online rust dating profile.\n*If you can't handle this point, do not pass begin, do not collect 200 wood, GTFO. \n\n- You have a rock and a torch, they are used to bash trees, animals, rocks and hordes of preteen nakeds that chase, and kill you for no reason. Be careful! Trust no squeakers! And if you come across someone who doesn't kill you right away...BE CAREFUL! They are cunning and probably have a deeper, more mature psychopathic nature. \n\n- Once you gather enough wood for spears, stuck a few naked preteens to death, and move your way up the food chain, you'll need a place to stash your goodies. Location is very important, you will need access to basic resources like fresh water, stone and wood, but also isolated enough to not attract the older, more geared players that will level your base and put you in the middle of their circle jerk while chanting \"whats good ma dude\" to completion before killing you...Then picking you up saying \"sorry brah, my bad, sorry man, want to join us?\" IT'S A TRAP! They will kill you after 5 seconds whether you respond or not.\n\n- Now after getting your tits pushed into the dirt a couple of times, or in my case, an impressive BBC (A couple times being an understatement) you will establish a little 2 x 2 house that's quite isolated, some food in the chest, a nice pickaxe, hatchet and a roaring furnace. You might even be so lucky as to have a friendly neighbor. Well done, you have made it further than you would have for about 10 hrs of your initial gameplay. Don't let this discourage you from getting the game though! Or do, you salty noob. \n\nThe Middle:\n\n- Now that you've ticked off two to three of Maslow's tiers it's time to have some fun.\n\n- You will need to grow your arsenal and this can be done in a few ways depending on your skill set:\na) Do you like exploring and avoiding danger? Night time rad town runs might be for you!\nb) Do you like adrenaline rushes and close calls with death? Killing geared players on their rad town runs might be for you!\nc) Do you enjoy asserting your dominance over others, puffing up your own ego over those that clearly are helpless against it? Raiding the nakeds might be for you! *use of the \"What's good ma dude?\" slogan is optional.\nd) Are you a PVP god and enjoy using the terms \"Get Rekt\" and \"360 no scope\"? Raiding other big boy clans might be for you! *A YouTube channel to upload tutorials on how to 1 v 5 is optional.\n\n- Expect to get raided! No matter how isolated you are, how strong you think you are or how many slaves you've forced into hard labor on your hemp farm, there will come a time when you get raided. If you are lucky, your base could hold them off for long enough while you and your human shield of slaves fight them off, with all your cleverly placed traps, your double stacked foundations and your triple stacked walls. In most cases, however, you will get a rather efficient, high pressured enema that will usually take place when you are out shopping IRL.\n\n- The aftermath of a raid: Once you come back to an empty house, you will go through the five stages of loss. Namely denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance. The only part we will discuss is acceptance, provided you didn't destroy your PC in stage 2. There are really only 4 options after a raid, and that again is dependent on your skill set:\nType a) players: Pick up your sleeping bag, if you still have it, and jog on. \nType b) players: Learn the weak spots of your base, rebuild, and hope your online next time they come so that you can defend yourself.\nType c) players: Find a naked, take over their base and relocate. It is very important that you wait for the poor naked to come back to the base and beg for some of their gear back, make sure you only reply with \"Why so salty\" before giving some gear back, and then proceeding to kill them.\nType d) players: This is what stirs your coffee! Call your boi's and start recording! It's time to make a counter raid video!\n\n-The end:\n\nRegardless of the server you choose, one thing is certain. All maps will eventually wipe. All your hard work, all the times you've laughed, you've cried, it all gets wiped like the blackboard of your maths class. What was it all for? What did you learn? Was it worth it? Will I ever use that knowledge in the future?\n\nIn short. No.\n\nThere is only a brief moment in time when you will be on top, or at the bottom, depending on your preference.\nOne thing is for certain though, whatever you choose, it feels GOOOOOOOOD.\nI can best sum it up as a heroin rush, followed by addiction and hatred for yourself and your life choices.\n\nIf you're gonna buy Rust because of this review, and you didn't type TLDR, then welcome!\n\n*Edit: I've now been re-rolled as an asian dude.

Yet I somehow keep coming back to this game time and time again. The base building is incredibly cool and all the stuff you can place and design makes it feel like your very own personal base. The weapons are all neat too, with guns being very rare, while more primitive sharpy things are pretty common. I wouldn't get to attached to your weapons though, you might lose them.\n\nNot only your weapons, your base can be lost as well. Raids happen, but if your base is small enough they might leave you alone. Might.\n\nAll right, all right; should you buy this game? Yes. It's still being updated and you learn as you play.

After I built my house I finished it off with a painting on the front of the house, it was simply a drawing of a smiley face. \n\nIt was starting to get dark at that point and I was in need of wood and mushrooms, so I headed out to go collect some, I must have been gone for at least 20 minutes, at that point it was pitch black outside. I reached my home to discover something had changed, my little drawing no longer existed, instead, it was replaced with the word \"GOATKING\", the background of the painting was red and the writing was black. I looked around to see if anyone was nearby, but not a single person was in sight. \n\nI entered my home and closed the door behind me, I went up the stairs and started my fire to heal myself and so that I could see as it was still dark. Once the sun came back up I opened my front door to discover a little brown bag on the floor right in front of my door, I picked it up and looked inside... It was a skull, a human skull. I did not know what to think, I was but a noob in these parts, so all I had to defend myself with... was a stick. Time went on and every now and then I would get another bag with a skull in it, I had no idea who was doing this and tried my best to catch them but I never even heard them in the first place. Until one night...\n\nI was sat in my house and heard people running around outside, I peaked out my only window to see five people holding torches, they were standing in a line towards my house, they were all wearing the same clothing too, but what really caught my attention was their heads, they were all wearing some type of animal skull, like a deer or horse. They spotted me at the window and one of them started saying \"Oooh-ahhh goatking\" over and over again, the other four people also started saying the same thing shortly after, this went on for sometime, after a while they came up to my door, knocked and then left. There was no way I was opening the door so I just waited until daytime arrived.\n\nOnce it was light out I opened my door to discover two bags, one bag contained the usual human skull and the other contained clothing, the same clothing that the people were wearing outside my house last night. Did they want to recruit me? I ended up putting it on and carried on with my day by collecting some stone. I got back to my house and upgraded some walls to stone for extra protection. I left my house to discover that those people from last night had returned, and they now all stand right in front of me, I never even heard them outside, they told me to follow them back to their camp, which I did... It was a short trip because their camp was the house right next to mine, I had no idea that they lived so close but had never been over to their house anyway.\n\nI entered their house and never left, as I write this I am still locked inside their home, they feed me human flesh and mushrooms every now and then but that's about it, I am locked in a room with two other people, they seem nice enough, we have gotten to know each other very well. I don't know what is next for us, but I pray that you don't make the same mistake...\n\nDon't trust anyone in Rust. \n\n\nUPDATE: It turns out that one of the people that were kidnapped and in the room with me was part of some resistance group, long story short. A group of around 10 people came and saved us, they killed the members of the cult and set us free from the room of horrors, this group also took me back to their real camp and put me in their hotel for free. I recently got a knock at my hotel door, they have a postman too! He gave me a note that told me the upcoming weather and events that would take place at the camp, they're having a barbecue soon so that should be neat. \n\nAlso this group is at war with another group.", "timestamp_created": 1518553240, "timestamp_updated": 1518568424, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 269, "votes_funny": 491, "weighted_vote_score": "0.887764453887939453", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12088433": {"recommendationid": "12088433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013536395", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 484911, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4708, "last_played": 1551863487}, "language": "english", "review": "Best game I've ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1410636534, "timestamp_updated": 1462483937, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 125, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870353519916534424", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "46552007": {"recommendationid": "46552007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045042455", "num_games_owned": 3094, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 78235, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549192149}, "language": "english", "review": "There's no TRUST in RUST.\n\nGood Game.", "timestamp_created": 1542969500, "timestamp_updated": 1542969500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 220, "votes_funny": 111, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861833453178405762", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8009134": {"recommendationid": "8009134", "author": {"steamid": "76561197966598809", "num_games_owned": 1305, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6263, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1531252683}, "language": "english", "review": "A lot of naked men throwing rocks and trying to survive against [strike]zombies[/strike], animals and other naked men.", "timestamp_created": 1386799918, "timestamp_updated": 1387228362, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15126, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.887894570827484131", "comment_count": 199, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39858718": {"recommendationid": "39858718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067002281", "num_games_owned": 1002, "num_reviews": 60, "playtime_forever": 12046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519628409}, "language": "english", "review": "In Rust you'll have neighbors that could wipe you of the face of the server, but choose to give ya a pickaxe & hatchet to help you start off.

In Rust you may choose to play alone or with others to survive, build, and loot.  The game is at its best on its community servers as the official ones tend to be overly crowded and very intense for a beginner.  In Rust you spawn in a random area of the very large map with nothing at your disposal but a rock, a torch, and bandages (Depending on the Server).  With that rock you begin your seemingly overwhelming journey of gathering supplies, supplies allow you to create tools, and buildings.  From there most players choose to explore their surroundings and upgrade their defenses.  \n\nThis game while enthralling is a time consumer and requires a lot of your attention, other players can kill you and loot your corpse.  I've spent hours upon my intitial spawn working in a community of players building a small city and upgrading to metal walls.  We traded supplies, hunted together, looted nearby rad towns, and even slowly accepted new players into our ranks.  Our small group had become a society, we aided those who needed help and defended our small city from other players masked as bandits.  We had come to know each other by first names and trusted that our things be safe while not ingame, as there was always another player on watching over your city.  \n\nThis game is perhaps the first game to create a challenging but engaging true to life experience.  Things I had never experienced in a game before such as trying to decide amongst your fellow founding members if the lone newbie could be trusted behind our walls?  Do we let him in?  Should we make him bunk in the Newbie quarters overnight until he pulls his own weight?  Are our walls truly safe?  Who should be allowed to carry rifles?  How can we expand our society and truly be able to keep our loot safe?  All of these questions come into play at any given point.  \n\nPlay with the right people, on the right server, and you too can have this experience.  As for that society?  What led to our unavoidable demise?  One lone player trusted behind our walls was able to level everything in just a few hours.  That is part of the game though, that experience, is what defined for me what games should be aiming to deliver a one of a kind experience I can experience nowhere else.  \n\nYour experience may vary, your story may differ, but mine definitely enables me to recommend this game to the average player.  \n\nIf you enjoy working hard at something, having a totally different survival experience, definitely buy this game.  \n\n*I can't recommend this to someone who enjoys a quick shooter game or fast paced experience, it is slow but the rewards are so much greater.", "timestamp_created": 1443942370, "timestamp_updated": 1443942415, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870194613933563232", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23471880": {"recommendationid": "23471880", "author": {"steamid": "76561198011717223", "num_games_owned": 90, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 3025, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1466002926}, "language": "english", "review": "The issue I have with the game, is by far, its community.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Intense survival experience, you are a mortal in a dangerous world\n\n- Initially cold, hunger and thirst are real threats.\n\n- The graphics can be very pretty, if you can run them.\n\n- Sounds are nice, gun shots ring out and pierce the still air.\n\n- Building is interesting and fun.\n\n- exploration is interesting and the blueprint system is pretty fun.\n\nCONS:\n\n- The community tends to be absolute garbage *Expanded at the bottom*\n\n- Servers tend to be immediatly taken over by massive constuctions, and sometimes clans immediatly dominate.\n\n- Resources become scarce pretty damn quickly\n\n- Animals run up sheer cliffs and can be quite glitchy\n\n- No costomizability *this is very minor*\n\n- KOS; COD style.\n\n-Optimization, my decent rig constantly overheats if I don't put my fans into hyperdrive; manually.\n\n\nNOW TO EXPLAIN: The community is simply cancer. If you are neaked and a geared trooper sees you, you can almost bet that he is going to shoot you for no reason. The excuse is; this is PVP, and that you ar a potential danger, or even \"Just like in real life\" \n\n     Well here is the issue, KOS is not very real life, BUT the game is silent, it is dead when you move around. The only thing to break the silence is gunshots, some screeming from what is usually a poor helpless naked that has just barely managed to get his 2.5k wood to start his shack. Even when he makes his shack, instead of negotiating forming an alliance, this player is eliminated, his base raided for little to no resources and as such he has to start all over and the raider gets the thrill of raiding an offline 2 by 2 shack. This is all due to a KOS mentality that is so far from survival mentality that it is in reality COD mentality. The game runs like this:\n\n1) Spawn, get materials build a small base\n2) get blueprints and start gettign ready to wreck some anus\n3) establish dominance in your area\n4) Once dominance is established with your little posse build a massive unraidable castle\n5) dominate the area and consume all resources, killing anyone you see for the fun of it, because you are now bored. \n6) Make four excuses : \"Git Gud\" , \"Become like us\" , \"Everyone is a threat, therefore I can KOS because I feel like it\" , \"Man salty nakeds\" \n\nI once managed to get a small group going, immediatly a small but well armed clan emerged from their base and began hunting nakeds, just because. We had just managed to make a bow for one of us, when they emerged from the trees and just sprayed into us, killing all 5, and screaming through their mics that we suck and to \"git Gud\". This behaviour has slowly but surely been spreading throughout the entire community because it is the best way to play. Kill everyone, steal their resources, build yourself. It's also pointless. It makes the game a ghost town. Not but one year ago the servers were full of new players. Now the servers I usually play on barely peak over 1/2 the population, most of those being either clans or KOS' ers. \n\n     It is sad to see such a great game go to waste because of the community, the only break from this is RP servers and PVE servers. RP servers maintain that PVP aspect, but give it a nice twist where KOS is rerely an option as each side has quite a lot to loose and tensions get higher than ever, whereas with KOS its usually just a naked dropping dead every so often. Sometimes clans will clash and then everything looks great. But those occurences are rare. \n\n     The community needs to change if the game is going to ever survive, and in fact, thrive. I would suggest implementing a system like unturned has. You cannot hide weapons in your quickbar, either you have a tool to quick draw or a weapon, and then everyone can see how well armed you are, as well as add some strategic depth to the game. Also make nature more intense, make the PVE aspect even more challanging, its apparently post nuclear time, some strange shit ought to be walking around. It would add a nice threat to well geared players and well give nakeds a nicer start as they are suddenly not the primary target for shits and giggles. There also needs to be benefits to living a peaceful life, and benefits to living a violent one, and each needs its downsides. Right now violence is the only solution, pitifully so. Your chances of going out and finding a place to survive peacefully is nigh impossible. Especially when these massive bases make their rise. The only person rading such a base is another person with a similar base, and even then they will probably fail, and require a clan. \n\n     The game needs to change, and minor changes are needed. But as it stands I would not recommend the game. An amazing idea ruined by a terribly toxic community. Maybe ill come back to it next year. But for now, ill try and develope my own game, and see if I can fix these issues myself. -->\n\nDISCLAIMER: This review is old, and as such does not reflect the game in its current state. I have been notified that apparently substantial changes have been made to the game. These changes might have fixed a lot of the issues that were inherent ot Rust, especially community based ones.

For the first couple hours you play this game, mute voices. Trust me, you don't want to listen to little kids who are either roof camping or running around with a group of 6+ talking shit about you when you die. Don't get stressed out about not having a gun in first hour. The game takes patience. If you like to PvP, then yea, you should have a gun by the first hour, but if you like to build, dont worry about the gun. Just farm resources. Also don't get discouraged if you got raided offline. It just means that who ever raided you was to much of a pussy to raid you online because they know they would lose to you. Unless you live in a 2x1 base then yea, you're at fault there. When just joined a new server, don't bother farming for stone and stuff, just get some tools, and farm scrap. Because by chance you could get a gun from a box and then you would want to research it, this also gives you the opportunity to know who are the nice people and who are fuckers who like to roof camp or zerg up. \n\nSo overall, its not a bad game, there are some try hards, there are some dicks, but that's every game that is open survival.", "timestamp_created": 1536173500, "timestamp_updated": 1536173500, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 157, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858352184295654297", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31826974": {"recommendationid": "31826974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198313020318", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13787, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1511414131}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Game toxic cummunity.", "timestamp_created": 1495132771, "timestamp_updated": 1495132771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78281790018081665", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23509732": {"recommendationid": "23509732", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154489473", "num_games_owned": 194, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 54862, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527284562}, "language": "english", "review": "456 Hours of Rust at this time. Here comes my review on the game in it's current state: Rust is an amazing game, one of, if not the best survival games on Steam right now. But the thing that drives everyone, literally fucking everyone away from it, is it's community. The community in Rust is quite possible the most toxic and unfair group of people you will ever lay your eyes upon and you might truly think they all deserve to die, they might. On modded servers where you don't have to farm for an hour before you're able to even think of getting a base, still, it's nigh impossible to play without a group of 4 people or more because you will be demolished by every squeaker who gets a waterpipe regardless of skill.\n\nNow on vanilla servers....where the gather rate is NORMAL....there comes to issue of a broken keyboard/monitor etc. you will be out alone for a VERY long time and the second you run into one person with better things than you, you have to start over ALL. OVER. AGAIN. It's very repetitive unless you have a group of your closest friends to play with you so you don't get destroyed. On the decent side, again, Rust is a very amazing game without the community, with great building systems, radtowns to find loot, and an amazing world to explore. But once more, stay away from this game until the community grows up and finally finishes 3rd grade, or you have a group of friends to enjoy the game with you.", "timestamp_created": 1465681224, "timestamp_updated": 1465681224, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 624, "votes_funny": 63, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856751918792724609", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "30778655": {"recommendationid": "30778655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027818711", "num_games_owned": 218, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 38639, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529641898}, "language": "english", "review": "I got somewhat 500 hours in this game and i just decided to write a review for it.\n\nGame has a lot of potential, some of it hidden. Rust is better played in a group of 3 to 5 on a medium or big server with constant rivals at your doors and glitches on your back. It's been in early access for quite some time now but unlike other games, this one actually has updates (weekly). Devs aren't afraid to change gameplay mechanics to see how it plays out in the end, this is Early Access after all. So, how's the game up close?\n\nGameplay is simple in its basics. Just survive. Kill, build (optionally, tho, you can even survive without a base), farm (a lot, especially if you're alone) and do whatever you want. Currenly, as of beginning of 2017 there is no end-game content or any specific objective to do. Most people tend to raid once they have reached a certain level of development; some just build the biggest and baddest base around and stay in it, occasionally killing someone from their roof and most of the players are engaged in pvp content, whether they want it or not. No one is protected from having his \u0430ss handed to him just because he made a wrong turn in the forest and walked up on a gang of 3 ruskies with ak's and full armor. This is why the game is best played in group, that way you can have an actual objective in game - to have fun together, instead of just building a base or raiding someone.\n\nGraphics, optimisation, all of that are changing constantly and for some the game would be unplayable, but that's only if you have a very old pc. Currenly, i'd have about 40 fps on high on r9 270x and i5. But since it's early access and unity together, means that there are a lot of bugs and nothing can save you if you suddenly freeze during a firefight. Happens occasionally.\n\nSound - eh, it's alright. Music - eh, turned it off.\n\nSocial interactions - knock a door, press V and scream SUKA BLYAT SUDA IDI NAHOOY, get rekt.\n\nPotential - a lot, if devs keep on updating as they are, game will (probably... hopefully) leave ea with a lot of content and ready to conquer steam charts.", "timestamp_created": 1490643270, "timestamp_updated": 1490643270, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 112, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.862892508506774902", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "47414264": {"recommendationid": "47414264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198340163387", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 34784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549966033}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game and very toxic", "timestamp_created": 1544357325, "timestamp_updated": 1544357325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 72, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867585599422454834", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42187290": {"recommendationid": "42187290", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020172332", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26117, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545101858}, "language": "english", "review": "Pro: Can be fun, can be rewarding.\n\nCon: The fun is constantly drained and destroyed by other players.

Another negative game review for a game that is getting great press. How could this person be so ignorant of the majesty that is RUST? However, there is a specific reason I'm giving this game thumbs down. It will not go anywhere, it will take your 20 bucks unless you get it on sale, and say thank you for your money, and it will leave you feeling in some way molested after the experience of playing it for a few days.\nLet me first start off by saying the game is fairly well put together as far as it\u2019s landscape. The game map has very few clipping issues, or pit falls that will leave you stuck, and unable to retrieve your gear if you can get back to your gear before it disappears. The higher end guns and ammunitions work fairly well together, and the graphics are pretty good up to this point in the games development, so I can\u2019t give it bad marks in these regards.\nWith that said I must commence with the game breaking negatives this game has to offer. After a few romps around different servers it has become clear that the game engine of this game is so full of security holes it could be used as a cheese grater. What could have been an awesome game has been reduced down to a slew of game cracking trolls that spend their time finding exploits to the game that allow them to fly, summon in anything they want, and know exactly were you are on the map at all times so that they can kill you and laugh. After reading up on the web about this wonderful game breaking experience, I was sad to see that the game engine used for the game is the cause of this slew of security problems. In short, the game designers would have to completely port this game over to another game engine just to fix the issue of hackers galore. Meaning they would have to start from scratch.\nThis game is in Alpha stage, and I understand that the company still can say that it\u2019s in Alpha stage and it will still have problems. The issue is the game will stay in Alpha stage. The majority of people that want/wanted to play this game have come and gone, the player base has been destroyed. For a game that is to be a multi player game it will not have the multi player community after it\u2019s all said and done.\nPlease, I beg of anyone thinking about playing this game to just say no. If you want to end up either dropping the game after a few days of play, or turning into a Troll, please stay clear of RUST.\nIn truth please stay clear of any game that says ALPHA in its description. At least with a BETA game you can say it\u2019s past the majority of its development issues. I don\u2019t care what age, race, or gender you are. It\u2019s your responsibility as the player to put a stop to game companies wanting to get the juice out of a lemon before it\u2019s ripe. And in the case of RUST I will chalk this game up as a learning experience.\n\nEdited 7/3/2014\nOK, so I have to give the makers of this game major Brownie Points. they're actualy going to restart the game over on another game engine. Seriously this takes big man tenders to actualy accept the fact your product isn't going to work, and put forth the effort to fix it.

Would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you know what you're getting yourself into.\n\nWell, first off, Rust is a game of \"Survival\". But their definition of survival is... well... different. To be bluntly honest, the nature of the game encourages and rewards you for being an absolute dickhead. For a game that plops you naked on a beach with nothing but a rock, there are alot of guns and powerful weapons players can get easily and very early on. The game appears to cater to clan and group wars, which I'll admit, makes for some excellent videos. But the fact of the matter is most people (myself included) don't want to play that way. This game becomes a HUGE investment of your time as typically, it will require hours to build a \"raid-proof\" home. And once your home is finished, you'll look out at the beautiful sunset and log off, confident your hard work has paid off, despite the fact that your home is only 30% actual home and the other 70% is pure armor. But when you log in less than 24 hours later, you find yourself waking up on noob beach. Because for every hour you spent building your home, some prick has spent double that left clicking the attack button with one hand while furiously fapping with the other to wreck your hard work. But if you can manage to build a good home on a good server, the game can be a very rewarding experience.\n\nRust for me had alot of disappointing, infuriating moments, which often keeps me from coming back to play. But it also had alot of great moments. The act of logging on alone was an anxiety, waiting at the loading screen wondering if I've been killed or if I was still safe. The intense feelings of paranoia from the presence of other players and of protecting my home. The adrenaline rushes of being shot at, and of going on intense raid missions. The excitement of assassinating a powerful kingpin (who deserved it) or gunning down a warring maruader. And finally, the feeling of looking out the window of my beautiful home at a beautiful view of the sunset or a full moon on the ocean. A game has never before invoked as much emotion out of me as Rust has.\n\nI would reccomend these tactics for staying alive:\n- Play \"Native American\" style. Plant your sleeping bag in a bush where no one will find it, and live a life of very little materialism. If you die or are robbed, you lost very little\n- Hide. Build your home where no one will find it. Consider sacrificing a fort for a smaller home. It will be easier to raid, but harder to find. Raiders will assume there is a bigger bounty inside a bigger fort, but might decide not to waste their time on a smaller home because they'll think you're poor. Stay far away from the West and East coasts (where new players generally spawn), away from the middle of the map, and away from the road and rad towns. Build next to clusters of big rocks, or terrain that would be unappealing for travel (for example, tundra), and never in the open. You will likely be found eventually, but I have had games where I was either never found or if I was, players just left me alone. And it will give you lots of time to estabilsh your hold. \n- Play the game RIGHT after servers wipe so that you're the first person to start on a brand new island\n- TRUST NO ONE. You may find players that will like to trade or who will actually help you. But always practice your politics very carefully. Most players will shoot you on sight\n- Get a feel for the population of the server. I usually go to servers that appear abandoned and play alone for quite some time. Sometimes it works, sometimes the server suddenly becomes popular. You can refresh the server lists to constantly know how many people are on a server at all times. On rare occasions, you can find servers where the strongest players are friendly's who will actively hunt the kind of people who seek to ruin your day. You can collaborate with these people\n- Understand raid tactics. You can lock your door, but can they blow a hole in your window? Come in from the roof or the foundation? Did you destroy the stairs so no one can get up to you? Did you build a third floor in case they blow up the first floor ceiling? Did you armor the hell out of your cupboard so they can't build their way around? There are lots of things to consider, and the game is constantly updating in ways that require new strategies.\n- Raid a few homes yourself. I'm generally a peaceful player, but if I see someone setting up camp too close to my territory, I treat it like a threat. Because let's face it, it generally is. The players will eventually find your home if they haven't already, and you can't trust them not to come after you. Again, you can check the servers for population and you can scope out targets to determine if the player is currently online. Exploit weaknesses, get in, loot, and get out as fast as you can. Know how long the travel will take and take advantage of things such as the cover of night. Stay out of the road and weave through trees, bushes, and etc. Make sure no one sees you, catches your name, and make damn sure you aren't followed. \n\nGood luck and happy hunting", "timestamp_created": 1449649231, "timestamp_updated": 1449649231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 455, "votes_funny": 105, "weighted_vote_score": "0.908807814121246338", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "42944798": {"recommendationid": "42944798", "author": {"steamid": "76561198069167092", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 53486, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547917417}, "language": "english", "review": "Ok so played this game a ton and enjoyed past versions but the way it is now and at final release is terrible. The devs have purposfully made it so you cannot enjoy this game as  a new player and in my opinion taken away the essence of rust  and made it just a longer term battle royale game for the following reasons\n\n1. Impossible as a solo player unless you play on a dead server or a solo only server (which just go play a farming sim in that case) you will most likely never see or touch a gun as the large groups of expierienced players will kill you every 2-3 steps and due to them nerfing the bow and spear (the only obtainable weps for you) it is highly unlikely you will kill any of them \n\n2. The game is so old and toxic that finding a solid group requires either slaving for 100+hours or geting extreemly lucky because most established groups kill on sight\n\n3 Its not what made rust popular anymore in the since that no one talks over vaciinity mic. Which means people will not communicate with you besides the \"haha get owned bitch\" that occures after 4 of them shoot you to death as you try to eek together enough wood for a spear\n\n4. Because no one uses the mic anymore the community aspect of the game has deteriorated. People used to help newbies and and least say a few things before the shots ring out.. the only thing you should expect to hear from other players is a gunshot sound followed by your screen going black\n\nAnd to those trolls who are undoubtly going to say \"mad cause your just bad\" I played the full expierience was in a succesfull clan for ahwile and solo'd to  some degree of success for the last year or so. My point is not that the games to difficult its that its unfair and if you happen to be a FPS god you will have much more fun on other games.

I think to myself why did i buy this game? I contemplate even respawning but i do. Only to be greeted by a man named Pablo. Pablo was a man of many talents, he took me under his wing and told me to follow him back to his base. I was not anticipating getting locked in a jail cell along with many other fresh spawns beside me, each in their own cell. Each cell had a window and i was on the ground level of the compound. I looked outside, we were surrounded by high stone walls and there was no way for anyone to get in and rescue us i thought, I was wrong. That night i heard explosions and looked out as i saw a wall come crashing down before me, it was a group of 3 people, but they were no match for Pablo, he shot all 3 but not before 1 chucked me an AK through the window... I wondered what i could do with this, could i kill Pablo having only played the game for half an hour? I waited for him to come with food and i launched my attack, he opened my door and i shot him in the head. I looked in his corpse and saw something i never thought i would, he was holding the rocket launcher the 3 men used to break through the walls previously. 7 Rockets were also there, i ran to the exit and blew out, using 4 of the 7 rockets in the process, Pablo was outside, i used a 5th rocket and blasted him. 2 left. I look to my left, there it was, the hole in the wall but i wanted more revenge, i decided to head further into the compound using my last 2 rockets to blast through a wall which had Pablo's sleeping bag and Tool cabinet in it. I struck gold. I authorised myself and destroyed Pablo's sleeping bag - I was now the ruler of Pablo's prison.

It's unacceptable!\n\nThe rust community is beyond redemption, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!", "timestamp_created": 1465286026, "timestamp_updated": 1465286026, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 309, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829894185066223145", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13371300": {"recommendationid": "13371300", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032765023", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2064, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402154557}, "language": "english", "review": "To be clear i didnt always hate this game and indeed it was fun but honestly now it is nothing like what was promised\n\nLet me tell you all a story once upon a time there was a young handsome strong man who was in an apocolypse in which people spawn out of the ground naked women are gone and nearly all things have been forgoten (including circumsizion) the young man worked hard an built a shack he was shot by a man who took all his firewood \n\nThe man respawned and was rocked to death while building a fire\n\nthen rocked again \n\nand again\n\nfinaly he found a friendly and then another and another and inbetween a douche who they killed then they found another 3 friendlies. They built the starving african village where they all lived in shacks no one had a weapon better than a bow or a metal hatchet they went to the radzone and found zombies to kill and food and some sacks. One day great warriors came and built a massive mountain of wood 50 steps from thier home. then every day three times a day they attacked the village and demanded tribute the africans hid in thier huts and left food and charcoal in the fire pit for the great warriors. The africans were sad and no one had any clothes except one man with a turban. One day the great metal sky god apeared and dropped his gifts to the world and the invaders left to recieve his gifts and blessings. The starving african village took the whole day to build and got a small long house and a great weapon that fired metal which they put a metal torch on and hid next to the metal doors of the longhouse in a sack. The africans felt strong they all had clothes and hatchets and bows and a single fire stick that could be held in one hand the next day they left no tribute for the great warriors and they attacked the long house and used explosives on the doors of metal the africans fought back and were utterly crushed and forced to leave the land of thier ancestors where they had starved to death so many times before due to lack of chicken and they were killed everywhere they went every time. THIS WAS THE BEST TIME EVER IN THE GAME \n\nI got the game during the dutch auction phase which proposed it as a primarily eve survival game with zombies and extreme threat of cold and hunger. Now there are no zombies because they were removed ( dispite this bieng promised earlier when it was originaly released) and there is nothing but pvp they only focus on that adding weapons while water still does nothing and there is not thirst. its really sad all people do is attack freshspawns and take thier stuff even though they only live in a shack and have 1 piece of chicken a stone hatchet and a pair of socks and a hand full of rocks. \n\nNext complaint sleeper system... Worst idea i have ever heard. Combat logging was the only way freshspawns and friendlys could keep gear and now they cant log off safely even outside of combat. One time i was given a full kit of m4s shotgun c4 and full kevlar the server was laggy and i disconected. Join back 2 mintues later i have been killed with a rock and have nothng.\n\nNext complaint combat. It is entirely unfair people who have kevlar and m4s attack people and are impossible to kill for anyone without incredible weapons. it doesnt matter what you do shoot them 5 times with your pistol send an arrow literaly through thier skull so you see it going in and out both sides or unloading clips of ammo on them because they have medkits in thier hot bar so all they gotta do is press 5 when they get hit 6 times and they wont die dumbest idea to have instant healing kits. \n\nRadzones are now so hard to get into people either block them off or there are so many bears/ wolves that you need guns and armor and pills to get in and out so why even have them its not like the loot there is even that good \n\nthe map itself is actualy pretty small and only has one road \n\nand how long has this been pre alpha its terrible \n\nTHIS GAME HAD POTENTAIL IT WAS SOMETHING FUN ONCE BUT I WAS LIED TO AND IT IS NOTHING LIKE WHAT IT WAS PROMISED TO BE INSTEAD OF A GREAT CRAFTING AND BUILDING ZOMBIE FREE ROAM RPG EVE THIS IS A PVP WITH BEARS AND INSTA HEALS AND YOU LOG OFF AND WAKE UP DEAD WITH NOTHING NO MATTER WHERE YOU LOGGED OFF I HATE THIS GAME NOW AND I HAVE UNINSTALLED IT\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME ITS TRASH", "timestamp_created": 1418601708, "timestamp_updated": 1418601708, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 187, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.792701423168182373", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 6, "review_score_desc": "Mostly Positive", "total_positive": 98741, "total_negative": 26765, "total_reviews": 125506}}
