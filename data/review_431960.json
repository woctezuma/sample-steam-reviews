The level of detail, the level of hard work and dedication put into this $4 game is outstanding. The level design is gorgeous, the artistry is everything. What more can I say? Even the custom levels made by other players, like me, are well thought out. But don't even get me started of the character development. My favorite character is the game by far would have to be Kristjan Skutta. I love him because no matter what hardship he faces he always pushes through.

Again, Arsenal wallpaper is used, this time on preset High. As there are different options to choose, which define how the wallpaper will react to an application being run in fullscreen (Keep Running, Stop, Pause) a benchmark will be done for every mode and as reference with a standard windows desktop background.\nI chose the Benchmark Scene from Rainbow Six Siege with the graphics on ultra preset.

I was surprised that the software did much better than expected, but the results may differ, considering community-made wallpapers may use more resources. The CPU temperature values may not be very reliable due to the CPU being watercooled thus these values are at the very low end of the scale. \n\nWallpaper Engine does also have an impact on gaming performance, which can be kept to a minimum using the \"Pause\" or \"Stop\" behaviour for fullscreen applications.\n\nWith a hardware config as \"enthusiast\" as mine, i doubt that there will be serious performance issues with this application, but if you are gaming on a much weaker rig, i recommend turning down the settings of the live wallpapers a bit. \n\nAt the end of the day, you will have to decide yourself wether you want to sacrifice resources for cool a$$ (a$$ can be taken literally) wallpapers or not.\n\nI do not regret my 4 bucks on this software and will be using it from now on.", "timestamp_created": 1489256594, "timestamp_updated": 1489256642, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 332, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.951276183128356934", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "31953561": {"recommendationid": "31953561", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982638681", "num_games_owned": 270, "num_reviews": 33, "playtime_forever": 203, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1526846398}, "language": "english", "review": "Should be a Windows 10 built-in program, very good.", "timestamp_created": 1495725771, "timestamp_updated": 1495725771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 204, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.920848846435546875", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "47815040": {"recommendationid": "47815040", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139625438", "num_games_owned": 381, "num_reviews": 78, "playtime_forever": 343, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1550925345}, "language": "english", "review": "if you're an idiot who (like me) considered getting this at some point, but didn't due to assumed doubts, imma just go ahead and tell you, you're missing out BIG TIME\n\n\"but it consumes resources\"\n- it can consume next to none depending on the wallpaper you pick\n\n\"but it'll lag me\"\n- it pauses itself when you open a game, so... zero interference with game performance\n\n\"but it's just wallpapers that move\"\nhttps://i.imgur.com/ohDKCIO.jpg\n\napart from being able to put literally anything you want as your wallpaper, there's a F*CKTON of options in the workshop, all browsable within wallpaper engine itself, and MANY of these have several customizable parameters (volume, position, colors, etc)\n\nthings that, if i had known beforehand, i would've purchased this YEARS AGO:\n+ you can customize wallpaper pause/performance, so resource management will be the least of your worries\n+ there are sound sensitive wallpapers that will move if you're listening/watching something (bye rainmeter lol)\n+ there are lots of nsfw wallpapers for every taste\n+ you can make a playlist and get them to change whenever you want\n+ wallpapers for virtually any waifu ever, both lewd and sfw, BOUNCING TIDDIES BRUH\n+ \"cool sound bars/waves but i don't like the picture\", YOU CAN CHANGE IT\n\nlong story short if you like a pretty desktop and your computer isn't a potato, there is absolutely no reason for not getting this, it's worth every penny", "timestamp_created": 1545766484, "timestamp_updated": 1545766484, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 662, "votes_funny": 192, "weighted_vote_score": "0.945810496807098389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34679042": {"recommendationid": "34679042", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037920209", "num_games_owned": 763, "num_reviews": 564, "playtime_forever": 385, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497970310}, "language": "english", "review": "My girlfriend apologised me for checking weird websites.

But at the same time Object Desktop costs as much as $ 49.99, and separately DeskScapes is sold for a considerable $ 9.99. A similar utility PUSH Video Wallpaper will cost you $ 14.95. Agree, against this background, the price of the Wallpaper Engine at just $ 2.79 looks ridiculous, especially given that this program offers much more functionality and a really huge selection of ready wallpapers.\n\nAnd this can be two-dimensional animated wallpaper, three-dimensional scenes, the details of which can be changed on the fly, interactive wallpaper, video files (mp4, WebM, avi, m4v, mov, wmv), any web sites, even small gaming applications. Wallpaper Engine is very easy to configure and use, while playing full-screen games, the wallpaper is suspended and the application releases resources. CPU utilization and memory usage depend on specific wallpaper and when setting a high quality smoothing and refresh rate can significantly increase.\n\nThe main feature of the application is support for the Steam Workshop, in which, despite the fact that the Wallpaper Engine still has not left the Early Access, there are already almost 35,000 different wallpapers. And although the majority are animated shots with anime girls, among them you can find really great wallpapers on the theme of various games (Star Citizen, \"The Witcher\", Dark Souls), fantastic works, etc.\n\nPlus, the included editor that allows you to create your own 2D, 3D and animated wallpapers. Before using it, it is recommended to watch video courses. There is also a detailed FAQ with the analysis of the most common bugs. Because Wallpaper Engine is a full-fledged Steam application, the program has achievements and Steam cards for creating icons.\n\nUsers appreciated the functionality and cost of the program: at the moment it has sold 1,1 million copies. The final version of the Wallpaper Engine should be released this spring.
