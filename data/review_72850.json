First played this game on the 360 and loved every minute of it. Huge upgrade from Oblivion. It was one of the first games I bought whilst transferring over to PC.   It was one of those games for me where each playthrough was different.  \n\nThe story I really was interested in. The initial start on the wagon with unknown figures who eventually I would discover. Really pushed me into concentrating on this game. The concept I love with Bethesda games is the multiple choice quests. Allows for decision making and of course multiple playthroughs. \n\nThe graphics initially on 360 I didn't take notice of. I wasn't until I played it on PC I noticed the difference. The detail that was put into this game was amazing. The cities were some of my favourite areas to initially discover. The ambience whilst moving from quest to quest was soothing. The music was brilliant, one of my favourite soundtracks. The general exploring ambient noise was the best in my opinion. \n\nQuests and game mechanics. The questing experience I enjoyed. Your typical fetch quests are fine to an extent. Its nice to see that there were major side quests that would ultimately change the game. I was one of those people that tried to do every quest I got. Mechanics were something else. I had lots of fun using the bow and arrow and the shouts. The only profession I didn't have an interest in at the time was magic.  I can always come back and do another playthrough but magic didn't really appeal to me. I enjoyed the sword and bow combat a lot more. Mountain goat horse is a story for another time. \n\nThe DLC's were interesting in themselves. Dawnguard and the vampire questline introduced new mechanics and features which I enjoyed. Hearthfire allowed the user to build houses in areas around Skyrim. Very expensive hobby though. And finally Dragonborn which I had fun with.\n\nOverall, I feel that Skyrim is one of the best RPG's out there. Always one of my RPG recommendations.

Like many, this is the reason that leads me to not recommend the game. Don't get fooled by buying the Special Edition for the DLCs, the workshop has many mods that have MUCH more content than any Bethesda DLC. The game in itself is really good, and I enjoy playing it daily, but that was a terrible move from Bethesda.\n\nIf I had to recommend a mod if you decide to buy the Vanilla version, it would be Falskaar, it adds a whole new island to the game, with 100x the content you could find in any Bethesda DLC.

This blatant laziness and anti consumerism on Bethesda's part is blinding, yet Bethesda still claims to love us all as we are the fans that make up what their games are. Bullshit.

Well it is extremely good on one end and fucking terrifying on the other. The one advantage to using the same engine for nearly 20 years is that modders know it like the back of their hand; this can lead to extremely good mods such as the lost city or enderal, BUT (AND THIS IS A BIG BUT) it can lead to some of the most perverted shit you have ever seen. You want bestiality? Skyrim has it! What about slavery? Skyrim has it! Drugging, rape and any other weird shit imaginable? Skyrim has it! This is fucking terrifying for many reasons but the main one I am worried about is the fact that this could shape the personalities of many teens who play it into perverted little shits who see women as nothing more than sex objects; hell some mods even go as far to state they are! \n\nAll of this over the past eight years has led me to despise this game, company and its community for they have become a beast which is wild and greedy.

Game breaking bugs and bugs in general appear often in my time playing it, while SE only had some bugs. (Character stuck in crouch, important quest loot not appearing, quest items not taken by NPC quest giver, achievement straight up not given because game refused to give me quest item, Auriel's bow not working for some inexplicable reason, werewolf perks not showing up, etc). All of this things add up, which really irks you in the long run. \n\nOverall, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, buy SE instead.\n\nEdit: Since Bethesda is hiding the DLC page, and everyone is doing their part to keep it available, I too will post the links to the DLC. I still retain my opinion that this is an inferior version compared to SE (Unmodded of course).

For example the civil war questline could have been great and would have been great but it turned into \"go here take this fort\" when the production time was short changed. I adore Dawnguard and Dragonborn as far as storyline and characters go, but Skyrim's too-easy oversimplified gameplay drags them both down.

But if you are that 'no one', and you're thinking if you should get a game released waaay back -specially with other \"better\" options out there-, let me tell you that you're not going to regret your decision if you do choose Skyrim over other games.\nThis with the help of MODS, of course.\n\nThanks to the Mods that make the game bug-free, add new locations and quests, new characters, new RP posibilities, add Immersion to it (and the list goes on and on), I can guarantee you'll play Skyrim over and over again just to discover what might had happened if you decided to join X faction instead of Y. You'll have the chance to really, truly experience Skyrim in multiple ways: as a Rogue Wizard, a Witcher, a Savage Berserk, a Shadowy Blade, a Relic Hunter. A naked man/woman/apachehelicopter that shouts the shit out of your bronie/spidey/thomas-the-engine oponents, if you are into that.\n\nI played the vanilla game once, and I didn't even get passed the third or fourth Main Quest because I discovered Skyrim could be modded in an infinite number of ways. And being a player that enjoys Role Playing, Immersion, Realism and Survival, I didn't stop adding Mods until I was truly satisfied with my game (or when it crashed too often, ja!).\nIs there a Mod that adds new spells? I'll play as a Wizard. Another one improving combat, and another that includes Religion? I'll be a 2H Paladin then, which then corrupts himself with the power of Conjuration and becomes a Lich.\nPosibilities are endless, and so are the options to Mod your game.\n\nTl;dr\nIs Skyrim good? Yeah.\nIs Skyrim + Mods good? I have no social life because of it.\n\nYES, I GET IT. THAT JOKE RUNNING AROUND: MOD IT UNTIL IT CRASHES!!1!1!!\n\nMy laptop isn't the greatest.

However, with that same laptop I'm able to play with (around) 179 Mods installed, and enjoy a different Skyrim experience everytime I start a new game.\nI do get the ocassional lag, freeze and CTD (like everyone else), but IMO it isn't that harmful.

But, at the end of the day what I love most about this game is that after all this time playing, I can annoy my friends by reciting the full heimskr speech word for word and repeating generic guard speech in real life when I get bored. I mean all the speech. You know youve played too much when you tell people on the street that steel is solid and true and that they fancy one handed swords, not those clunky two-handed weapons. \n\nEther way get this game-its got dragons, magic, awesome weapons, brainwashing(the good kind), and replayability.

With Skyrim, the stories that come from how the game works are often the best ones.\n\nIt's a frozen nation, just to the north of where the previous game, Oblivion, took place. A briefly introduction sets up the plot: Skyrim is in the middle of a revolt, you've been sentenced to death, and dragons have just shown up. Good luck!\n\nAt that point, you emerge from a cave into 40 square kilometres of cold and mountainous country, and that's it. Everything else is up to you.\nNot all of the landscape is subzero, and even among the frosty climes there's an exciting variety: ice caverns that tinkle with dripping frost crystals, hulking mountains with curls of snow whipped up by the howling wind, coniferous forests in rocky river valleys.\n\nThe mountains change everything. Wherever you decide to head, your journey is split between scrambling up treacherous rocks and skidding down heart-stopping slopes. The landscape is a challenge, and travel becomes a game.\n\nIt's hard to walk for a minute in any direction without encountering an intriguing cave, a lonely shack, some strange stones, a wandering traveller, a haunted fort. These were sparse and quickly repetitive in Oblivion, but they're neither in Skyrim: it's teeming with fascinating places, all distinct.\n\nThese places are the meat of Skyrim, and they're what makes it feel exciting to explore. You creep through them with your heart in your mouth, your only soundtrack the dull groan of the wind outside, to discover old legends, dead heroes, weird artefacts, dark gods, forgotten depths, underground waterfalls, lost ships, hideous insects and vicious traps. It's the best Indiana Jones game ever made.The dragons don't show up until you do the first few steps of the game's main quest, so it's up to you whether you want them terrorising the world as you wander around. A world where you can crest a mountain to find a 40-foot flying lizard spitting jets of ice at the village below is a much more interesting one to be in. But fighting them never changes much: you can just ignore them until they land, then shoot them from a distance when they do.\n\nYour first dragon kill is a profound, weird moment. I rushed to the crashed carcass to loot it, then looked up. The whole town had come out to stand around and stare at the body, a thing as vast and alien to them as a T-rex in a museum.\n\n\nThere is also a level up system. When that happens, you get a perk point: something you can spend on a powerful improvement to a skill you particularly like. Every hour, you're making a major decision about your character's abilities.\n\nThey're dramatic. The first point you put into Destruction magic lets you stream jets of flame from your hands for twice as long as before. As you continue to invest in one skill, you can get more interesting tweaks: I now have an Archery perk that slows down time when I aim my bow, and one for the Sneak skill that lets me do a stealthy forward roll.\n\nAgain, the freedom is dizzying: every one of 18 skills has a tree of around 15 perks, and the range of heroes you could build is vast. I focused on Sneak to the point of absurdity - now I'm almost invisible, and I get a 3,000% damage bonus for backstabs with daggers. It's the play style I've always wanted in an RPG, but I've never been able to achieve it before. The enemies you encounter are, in some cases, generated by the game to match the level of your character. In Oblivion that sometimes felt like treading water: progress was just a stat increase, and your enemies kept pace. That doesn't apply now that your character is defined more by his or her perks, because the way you play is always changing.\n\nLevelled content is also just used less: at level 30, my most common enemies are still bandits with low-level weapons. And I still run into things too dangerous for me to tackle.\n\nTaking a narrow mountain path to a quest, something stops me in my tracks: a dragon roar. I check the skies - nothing, but I hear it again three more times before the peak.\n\nAt the top I find a camp full of bodies, with a large black bear roaring over them. Hah. He's still more than I can handle in straight combat, but as he reaches me I use a Dragon Shout. It befriends any animal instantly, and he saunters casually away. Feeling slightly guilty, I stab him in the back before it wears off.\n\nWhich is when the dragon lands, with an almighty crash, six feet from my face. I RUN!\n\nOne tweak is a huge loss, though: you can't design your own spells. Oblivion's spellmaking opened up so many clever possibilities - now you're mostly restricted to what you can buy in shops.\n\nWhile we're on the negatives, physical combat hasn't improved much. There are cinematic kill moves when your enemy is low on health, but whether they trigger seems to be either random or dependent on whether the pre-canned animation fits into the space you're in. Too much of the time, you wave your weapon around and enemies barely react to the hits.\n\nThe exception is archery: bows are now deliciously powerful, and stealth shots can skewer people in one supremely satisfying thwunk.\n\nWhat does improve the general combat is a feature I didn't quite expect: you can hire or befriend permanent companions. I did a minor favour for an elf at the start of the game that earned me his loyalty for the next 40 hours of play. Sidekicks add a wild side to fights: an arrow from nowhere can end a climactic battle, or a misplaced Dragon Shout can accidentally knock your friend into an abyss.\n\nThe Dragon Shouts, gained by exploration and killing dragons, are like a manlier version of conventional magic. One can send even a Giant flying, one lets you breathe fire, another makes you completely invincible for a few seconds. Even the one for befriending furry animals is macho: it can turn four bears and a wolf pack into obedient pets with one angry roar. The main quests themselves are mostly good: a happy mix of secrecy, adventure, and exploring incredible new places. One location, which I won't spoil, got an actual gasp. But then there's an abysmal stealth mission that seems to work on a logic entirely its own: guards spot you from miles away, despite facing the wrong direction. And the boss dragons it keeps throwing at you never get any more interesting to fight - adding more hitpoints just makes the repetition even harder to ignore.\n\nEverywhere else, the quests are magnificent. Chance encounters lead to sprawling epics that take you to breathtaking locations, uncover old secrets, and pull interesting twists. Even the faction quests are better here. It feels like Bethesda realised these became the main quest for many players, and built on that for Skyrim. They start small, but each one unravels into a larger story with higher stakes. Some of them feel like the personal epic that the main quest has always failed to be. These aren't engine issues, though. Skyrim is based on tech Bethesda built specially for it, rather than the middleware engine used by Oblivion and Fallout 3. It's a lean, swift, beautiful thing. New lighting techniques and a fluffy sort of frozen fog give the world a cold sparkle, and the previously puffy faces are sharp, mean and defined. Even load times are excitingly quick. On maximum settings, it runs at 30-40 frames per second on a PC that runs Oblivion at 50-60 - a decent trade off for the increase in scenery porn.\n\nThe games we normally call open worlds - the locked off cities and level-restricted grinding grounds - don't compare to this. While everyone else is faffing around with how to control and restrict the player, Bethesda just put a country in a box. It's the best open world game I've ever played, the most liberating RPG I've ever played, and one of my favourite places in this or any other world.\n\nIn case I'm not getting it across, this is a thumbs-up.", "timestamp_created": 1466977237, "timestamp_updated": 1467047006, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 134, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889746308326721191", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47990961": {"recommendationid": "47990961", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132750192", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 16948, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527756100}, "language": "english", "review": "Vanilla game 7/10\nMods 11/10", "timestamp_created": 1546272805, "timestamp_updated": 1546272805, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 96, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870175480842590332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28476561": {"recommendationid": "28476561", "author": {"steamid": "76561198247945392", "num_games_owned": 331, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 98080, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546549894}, "language": "english", "review": "I was stacking books on a shelf in my house in Whiterun, one of Skyrim's major cities, when I noticed a weapon rack right beside it. I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. \n\nPart of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds \u2013 the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user \u2013 but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. \n\n\nIt contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. \n\nMany times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. \n\n\nKilling a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words \u2013 each Shout has three \u2013 hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. \n\nNot only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. \n\nSkyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.", "timestamp_created": 1482187846, "timestamp_updated": 1482187846, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 233, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.899907708168029785", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28251669": {"recommendationid": "28251669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044384249", "num_games_owned": 986, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 14236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1535752711}, "language": "english", "review": "Take the time to learn how to mod Skyrim and you'll die happy.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a masterpiece as far as I'm concerned, mods or not.

Skyrim is a great, fun game even with the its many bugs and issues and disappointments.\n\n[b]The Good: [/b][list]\n[*][u]Environment[/u] \u2013 The world is beautiful. There is always something to stumble upon as you make your way around the world. There is always something beckoning you to see what\u2019s on the other side of that hill, ruin, mountain, river, lake, dungeon, tower, campsite. Bethesda is great at world building.\n[*][u]Exploration[/u] \u2013 The environment makes you want to explore; to see what\u2019s around this corner or what\u2019s in that cave or ruin. Simply walking around the world is so enjoying.\n[*][u]Soundtrack[/u] \u2013 Exploring with Jeremy Soule\u2019s soundtrack in your ears is perfect. Bethesda never seems to miss when it comes to their game\u2019s soundtracks.\n[*][u]Customization[/u] \u2013 Crafting, cooking, and enchanting wonderfully implemented into the game. Also, you can be whatever you want to be in the game which is a pro and also a con. You can be an Orc thief who is a master of sneak which is great. What\u2019s not so great is that there are no penalties due to being an Orc.\n[*][u]Perks and Leveling[/u] \u2013 While the vanilla perks aren\u2019t to the level of mods like PerMa or Ordinator, they are still decent. Leveling is also much improved compared to Oblivion. In Skyrim the more you use a skill, the better it is which is far better than the micromanaging of skill usage in Oblivion \n[*][u]Modding and Its Community[/u] \u2013 Without modding, the negatives of the game would not be correctable. The modding community is still active and creating wonderous things that make you wonder why they were never part of the base game.[/list]\n\n[b]The Needs Improvement: [/b][list]\n[*][u]Magic[/u] \u2013 The spells are just OK. Spell scaling is weak and make playing as a pure mage very difficult.  The spells themselves aren\u2019t very interesting either. Mods like Apocalypse \u2013 Spells of Skyrim and Lost Grimoire of Skyrim make magic a valid character to play.\n[*][u]Role-Playing[/u] \u2013 There are role-playing elements, but role-playing is placed mostly on the player. You have to role-play the situations and create your own story and limitations since the game does not really allow for choice.\n[*][u]Your Impact[/u] \u2013 At the end of the day, nothing you do matters. You can be leader of every guild, savior of Skyrim, ender of civil wars, and destroyer of vampire clans, and the people will still treat you like you have something to prove. What you do isn\u2019t really acknowledged and nothing you do changes anything. \n[*][u]Crafting and Enchanting[/u] \u2013 While crafting and enchanting are great, they are easily exploited and require the player to show self-restraint. You are basically forced into using perks points in these areas to keep your character strong enough to face the level scaled enemies.\n[*][u]The Civil War[/u] \u2013 War is hell and that\u2019s all the people talk about, yet you never really see signs of it. In the vanilla game, you really don\u2019t get to see the devastation a civil war would cause the populous and the land. Imperials and Stormcloaks aren\u2019t fighting each other. There aren\u2019t skirmishes happening across the land. Nothing. You need mods like Immersive Patrols and Open Civil War to correct some of this.\n[*][u]Factions and Their Quests[/u] \u2013 The faction quests are weak or ridiculous. You can become the Harbinger leading the Companions within a week of joining while also forcing you to be a werewolf! The Thieves Guild quests have less to do with thieving and more to do with fighting as well as forcing you to give your soul to a damn Deadra! The Mages guild quests can be done without ever really using magic.\n[*][u]The Power Fantasy problem[/u] \u2013 Not every game has to be a power fantasy.[/list]\n\n[b]Conclusion: [/b]\nEven with everything listed in the needs improvement section, Skyrim is still a great and wonderful game. A weak story with no choice or consequences and hand holding fetch quests doesn\u2019t detract from this. The modding community has fixed most, if not all, of the glaring issues in the game. With mods, you are able to play unique and complex playstyles, new dungeons, new lands, new perks, new magic, new weapons, interesting quests, engaging NPCs and companions, improved homes, varying enemies and creatures, and many, many, many quality of life improvements.

What am I? Stupid?\nBuckle up dear consumer because this review will change your mind.\n\nSkyrim is my fucking life, This game allows for so many things beyond mortal conception , even after 700 hours of playing this, which I started doing 3 or 4 years ago, there's still tons of monsters, spells, weapons, locations, armor, objects and quests I have never seen, and all of them are made with love and intent.\n\nNow a lot of people will tell you this game is shit and that since Morrowind(elder scrolls III), Bethesda, the company behind these games, has changed alot. People will tell you that Skyrim doesn't have the sense of exploration and arrival that Morrowind had.\nI played all Elder scrolls main games but ES2:Daggerfall, and I say that's bullshit. Skyrim might not have the strange setting of mushroom-trees or larvae that bury into your face, or the sense of not fitting into the world you are exploring, but that's ok. Skyrim still does an excellent job at making you not only feel rewarded for exploring, but also at making you WANT to explore. I've seen myself and countless other people, whether they're fully fleshed gamers or total console scrubs or even casual candy crush consumers PURPOSELY not use fast travel and instead just wander through the huge world this game offers.\n\nAnd that is only a slice of the cake, with Skyrim's two DLCs (both costing more money than the main game for some reason :b) the game gets even more depth, a complete set of new content layered onto your old world and some new, huge areas to explore. Both offer new magic, new weapons, new characters, new quests and new wordls and settings to explore, which is why I would say they're almost like totally different games. Heartfire is a completely different story, but that's not the sweets.\n\nYou are probably thinking right now \"Jesus, that sure does sound like an awful lot of fun, I won't be done with this under 300 hours of gaming!\" and you're right, I'd say a few houndred hours is probably what's going to flow into your first gameplay save. But hear me out: mods.\nThis game has the most incredible and far reaching modding community on the internet I've EVER seen, and I'm a modding addict, but this game has blown my mind with it's insane fanbase.\nIn one mod you can rebuild a city, another mod adds 1500 unique and creative spells, another adds 1000 monsters (not exxagerating btw, I have both of these mods installed and it's crazy how well they fit in, I started an almost completely new savefile and got to endgame just because of those mods adding so much new stuff), a different mod let's you rank up in the hirachy until you become the high king of the entire nation of Skyrim, allowing you to build your own kingdom and wage war even further into the elder scrolls lore, effectively fighting the next big threat after the dragon crysis.\nAnd that's not even remotely the tip of the icebirg, that was like an ant's leg cut off and placed onto the top of mount everest, it's nothing.\n\nIf you like exploration, combat that doesn't just rely on leveling, seeing a character grow, immersing yourself in a universe different from ours and especially if you like top cut RPGs, buy this game, it will serve you well, trust me, I should know.", "timestamp_created": 1492595149, "timestamp_updated": 1492595149, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.892319798469543457", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33617364": {"recommendationid": "33617364", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110148075", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 637, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482767874}, "language": "english", "review": "get this instead of the special edition.", "timestamp_created": 1500329098, "timestamp_updated": 1500329098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 266, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.885888516902923584", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40799703": {"recommendationid": "40799703", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086741345", "num_games_owned": 1978, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 88280, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548082884}, "language": "english", "review": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is a game that needs no introduction, and is still one of the most played games on Steam when you account for its two versions. A somewhat polarizing game, there are some that love it and some that hate it. Is it actually any good though? This is what I think of the Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.\n\nIn short, hell to the yes. Skyrim is my favourite ever game, beating out some serious competition to claim its place as number one in my heart. It'll probably stay that way too. Skyrim is a great game on its own, something much of the internet forgets in their annoyance at its enduring popularity but Skyrim with mods...that's what makes it truly unforgettable. With its fascinating world, plethora of quests, places to explore, houses to buy and guilds to join as well as the mods adding whole new lands and quests, this is the game that never ends. And will never die.\n\nThe story in Skyrim gets quite a bit of flak, and while it is a fairly routine save the world affair, it's a good one. You start off as a prisoner, because Bethesda has a secret fetish for prisoners, before rising up as a hero and saviour of the land. After an explosive start to the game, you are thrust out into the world and learn you are the Dragonborn, a mortal with the soul of a dragon. You are part of a prophecy, one that claims you'll save the world from the dragons, and importantly the first dragon, Alduin. It's grand, it's epic and I really like this one.\n\nIn Skyrim, the gameplay loop is one of the most satisfying I've played. I always found it kind of silly you can only level up in RPG's by completing quests and being given a set amount of XP. Skyrim continues the Elder Scrolls tradition of doing away with that. You have a variety of skills open to you, focused on three main styles. Warrior skills include your standard blocking, one and two handed, heavy armour and smithing. Mage skills have an array of defensive and offensive magic and there are thief skills like sneaking, pickpocketing and lockpicking. You level up by just using these skills, allowing you to invest perk points in your chosen skills. \n\nThe skill system is something old school Elder Scrolls fans didn't like, as they felt it dumbed the game down. I like to call it streamlined, and I actually think this system is better than the old, tired and archaic skill and leveling system found in its predecessors. Instead of being forced to use certain skills to boost certain attributes, you simply could use what you wanted to level in, assign some perk points that enhanced that skill, and put points in three attributes instead: health, magic and stamina. Gone are the usual strength, endurance and intelligence for this streamlined system. It works, and although I would have done it differently, I do think it's better than the old. \n\nThe world is one of the highlights of Skyrim, and is such a wonderfully crafted open-world. Completely free to explore after the opening mission, you can go anywhere and do anything. Feel like being a better warrior? Go clear out some dungeons. Want to join a guild? Do that and finish the guild quest-lines. Fancy some powerful artifacts? Do the Daedric quests. Want to pick a direction and see what you find? Do that. The world is packed with stuff to do and places to see. It's the game's biggest strength and I simply love exploring Skyrim. \n\nWith Skyrim Bethesda introduced the radiant quest system which is generally hated on. I actually really like it but to a point. It really enhances the feeling of your character having a profession, allowing you to perform routine quests for a guild for instance. But that shouldn't come at the expense of strong side quests, and Skyrim suffers from this. There are plenty of great side quests to complete but many resort to the radiant system of go here and kill that, come back for a reward kind of deal. It's one of its weak points. \n\nI could go on and on about the vanilla game, easily hitting the character limit but I'd prefer to address instead the one thing that truly makes this game special...the mods. There are so many mods to choose, from simple graphics overhauls and textures, to ones that enhance the weather in Skyrim, right down to armour and weapons mods. There are also a number of large new land and quest mods to pick, as well as complete overhauls. I could write a hundred reviews worth of mods and not be done. I'll instead recommend some essentials. SKSE is required, SkyUI, Interesting NPC's, The Notice Board, Ordinator, Immersive Armours and Weapons, Hunterborn, Frostfall and Campfire, Wildcat and Honed Metal. Those are just some of my essentials, and there are hundreds more. Skyrim can be modded to be anything you need it to be and can provide you with thousands of more hours of content. For free. \n\nNegatives. Yep, even my favourite game has flaws. Many. Combat is pretty uninspired but I really wouldn't have it any other way. Dark Souls it is not, but it does the job. The magic system is a step back from the last game, taking away the ability to invent new spells and hurting that aspect of the game in favour of more flair. Enemy AI are beyond stupid, especially whilst sneaking. The quests, as mentioned above, are often nothing more than fetch quests, although the game does have a selection of quests to rival any title out there. There aren't any notable characters in the game, none that can hold a candle to a Geralt of Rivia, Garrus Vakarian or a Varric Tethras, which is a shame.\n\nI only briefly mentioned the guilds in this write up but they suffer from being far too short. The civil war quest-line was gutted in terms of features, leaving an unremarkable series of battles in its wake. All four of the other guilds are fantastic, even the College of Winterhold, but there just isn't enough of those guilds before it's all over. You join up, do a few quests and suddenly you are the leader. It's rushed as hell, and can't hold a candle to Oblivion's masterclass in how to do guild quest-lines. Oblivion's guilds with Skyrim's repeatable quests after the arc is over, enhanced to be more sophisticated, would be an unstoppable combination.  There are also, bugs. Lots and lots of bugs. It's Bethesda, of course there's bugs. \n\nDespite that, Skyrim is and probably always will be my favourite game of all time. I still play it today, and with the vast number of mods out there, some that I've still not played, the game really is endless. Making new characters and writing fan-fiction about them before, during and after the events of the game is a new pleasure of mine. I'm hopelessly in love with this game, and the series, and hope you are too. If you are one of the two people that haven't played this game yet, don't. It'll consume your life like it did mine.

I set a sacrificial dagger in one slot, an Orcish mace in the other. They were on display for nobody but me and my computer-controlled housecarl, Lydia, who sat at a table patiently waiting for me to ask her to go questing. The chest upstairs was reserved for excess weapons and armor, the bedside table for smithing ingots and ores, the one next to the Alchemy table for ingredients. I'd meticulously organized my owned virtual property not because I had to, but because tending to the minutia of domestic life is a comforting break from dealing with screaming frost trolls, dragons, a civil war, and job assignments that never seem to go as planned. It's even a sensible thing to do; a seemingly natural component of every day existence in Skyrim, one of the most fully-realized, easily enjoyable, and utterly engrossing role-playing games ever made. \n\nPart of what makes it so enjoyable has to do with how legacy Elder Scrolls clutter has been condensed and in some cases eliminated. In Skyrim, there's no more moon-hopping between hilltops with a maxed out Acrobatics skill. That's gone, so is Athletics. The Elder Scrolls V pares down the amount of skills and cuts out attributes like Endurance and Intelligence altogether. There's no time wasted on the character creation screen agonizing over which skills to assign as major. You don't assign major and minor skills at all, but instead pick one of ten races, each with a specific bonus. High Elves can once a day regenerate magicka quickly, Orcs can enter a berserk rage for more effective close-range combat. These abilities are best paired with certain character builds \u2013 the High Elf regeneration is useful for a magic user \u2013 but don't represent a rigid class choice. Major decisions don't need to be made until you're already out in the world and can try out magic, sneaking and weapon combat, emphasizing first-hand experience over instruction manual study, letting you specialize only when you're ready. \n\n\nIt contributes to the thrilling sense of freedom associated with life in Skyrim. Do a quest, kill a dragon, snatch torchbugs from the air, munch on butterfly wings or simply wander while listening to one of the best game soundtracks in recent memory. Despite the enormity of the world and the colossal amount of content contained within, little feels random and useless. Even chewing on a butterfly wing has purpose, as it reveals one of several alchemical parameters later useful in potion making at an alchemy table. Mined ore and scraps of metal from Dwemer ruins can be smelted into ingots and fashioned into armor sets, pelts lifted from slain wildlife can be turned into leather armor sets, and random books plucked from ancient ruins can trigger hidden quest lines that lead to valuable rewards. Skyrim's land mass is absolutely stuffed with content and curiosities, making every step you take, even if it's through what seems like total wilderness, an exciting one, as something unexpected often lies just over the next ridge. \n\nMany times the unexpected takes the form of a dragon. Sometimes they're purposefully placed to guard relics, sometimes they swoop over cities and attack at seemingly random times. In the middle of a fight against a camp of bandits a dragon might strike, screaming through the sky and searing foe and friendly alike with frost or flame. Momentarily all on the battlefield unite, directing arrows and magic blasts upward to knock down the creature, creating impromptu moments of camaraderie -- a surprising change from what may have been yet another by-the-numbers bandit camp sweep. Dragons show up often, their presence announced by an ominous flap of broad wings or an otherworldly scream from high above. The scale and startling detail built into each creature's appearance and animations as it circles, stops to attack, circles again and slams to the ground makes encounters thrilling, though their predictable attack patterns lessen the excitement after a few battles. In the long run they're far less irritating than the Oblivion gate equivalent from The Elder Scrolls IV, can be completed in a few minutes, and always offer a useful reward. \n\n\nKilling a dragon yields a soul, which powers Skyrim's new Shout system. These are magical abilities any character can use, you don't have to specialize in spell casting to slow time, throw your voice, change the weather, call in allies, blast out ice and fire, or knock back enemies with a rolling wave of pure force. Even if you favor sword, shield and heavy armor and ignore magic entirely, you'll still be able to take full advantage of these abilities provided you find the proper words \u2013 each Shout has three \u2013 hidden on Skyrim's high snowy peaks and in the depths of forgotten dungeons, serving as another reason to continue exploring long after you've exhausted the main quest story, joined with the Thieves Guild, fought alongside the Dark Brotherhood, or thrown your support behind one of the factions vying for control of Skyrim. \n\nNot only is this land under assault by dragons, long thought to be dead, it's also ripped in two by civil war. You can choose one side or the other, but so much of the allure of Skyrim is how, even outside of the confines of quest lines, the embattled state of the world is evident, and steeped in a rich fictional legacy. Lord of the Rings this is not, but with the release of every Elder Scrolls game, the fiction becomes denser, and the cross-referencing for long-time fans all the more rewarding. \n\nSkyrim's residents are all aware of current events. They'll comment on the civil war, some sympathizing with the rebels, others thinking the establishment sold its soul. The peasants complain about the Jarls who control each settlement, the Jarls complain about the rebels or foreign policy, the overprotective College librarian complains when I drop dragon scales all over his floor; many characters feel like whole, distinct personalities instead of vacuous nothings that hand out quests like a downtown greeter hands out flyers for discount jeans. Characters stereotype based on race, they double-cross at even the slightest hint it might be profitable, and they react to your evolving stature within the world. It makes a ridiculous realm, filled with computer-controlled cat people and humanoid reptiles, demon gods and dragons, feel authentic, like a world that existed long before you showed up and will continue to exist long after you leave.", "timestamp_created": 1402788774, "timestamp_updated": 1469625731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2303, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.92006528377532959", "comment_count": 55, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48105803": {"recommendationid": "48105803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150732047", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 11047, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548549324}, "language": "english", "review": "I love Skyrim and all but what the fuck\nwhy did you have to hide all the goddamn DLCs, I am not going to buy special edition just to have DLCs on my game :I\nespecially when special edition breaks all the mods i use lmfao\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1546637159, "timestamp_updated": 1546637159, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797896325588226318", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43989606": {"recommendationid": "43989606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354747368", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 5333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1550711500}, "language": "english", "review": "0/10\nBethesda,stop hiding the steam workshop version of skyrim,you fricks.", "timestamp_created": 1533676117, "timestamp_updated": 1533676117, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 92, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843196392059326172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29148585": {"recommendationid": "29148585", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097471390", "num_games_owned": 283, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 7406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485484629}, "language": "english", "review": "I got lost in this game and never wanted to leave. \n\nOne of the best games ever made.", "timestamp_created": 1483992981, "timestamp_updated": 1483993523, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 91, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848480284214019775", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16816766": {"recommendationid": "16816766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055474560", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 16459, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502124844}, "language": "english", "review": "It really bothers me to see a lot of the 12,000+ negative reviews about the game due to the workshop.

It's my favorite video game saga and I would never be capable of describing with words how much I love it. Sometimes I may complain about some weak points it has, but those are absolutely nothing compared to the good things that makes it The Elder Scrolls, so then I go back to Tamriel and get immersed in this awesome universe and forget about everything.", "timestamp_created": 1468450145, "timestamp_updated": 1475864409, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.834945380687713623", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42904226": {"recommendationid": "42904226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073231129", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 96449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 20, "last_played": 1551388674}, "language": "english", "review": "Its alright, might do a second playthrough.", "timestamp_created": 1529593567, "timestamp_updated": 1529593567, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 61, "votes_funny": 221, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814986884593963623", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45622102": {"recommendationid": "45622102", "author": {"steamid": "76561198110198881", "num_games_owned": 215, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 9134, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1438, "last_played": 1551724148}, "language": "english", "review": "Enter drinking competition\nPass out\nWake up in a temple\nClean up mess\nRecover goat from giant\nKill spouse-to-be to get wedding ring\nGo to fortress\nEnter portal\nMeet the Daedric Prince of debauchery\nGet a cool staff\n\n10/10 would get drunk again\n", "timestamp_created": 1541338414, "timestamp_updated": 1541338414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 77, "votes_funny": 93, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836999356746673584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48735425": {"recommendationid": "48735425", "author": {"steamid": "76561198057928096", "num_games_owned": 195, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 62234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550571929}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: Game is legendary with nexusmods.com.\nCon's: Takes time...\nWarnings: If you have a balanced nice life, don't play it.

Ambient lighting and effects are excellent and the designers have succeeded in creating a diverse and atmospheric landscape. Character creation is good with a lot of customisation possible. All this, however, is completely and utterly eclipsed by what is possible with Mods. With Mods (readily available from the steam workshop) gamers are able to create breathtakingly stunning vistas, highly realistic characters, followers and NPC's. With over 24 thousand mods (at the time of this review) you can change the appearance of or add in pretty much anything you can imagine (the sky really is the limit). There is of course a performance trade-off when applying the ultra high definition textures and graphical mods so I recommend following one of the excellent guides available to find the right balance for you.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Audio[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]Music is grand and epic, very fitting to the feel of the game. Sound effects and voice acting are both excellent throughout and considering how many characters and quests there are in the world of skyrim this is quite a feat. Personal favourites for voice acting include the aptly named khajiit: M'Aiq the liar and the deranged murderous jester: Cicero.[/td] \n [/tr]\n [tr]\n    [td]Gameplay[/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]Skyrim is a joy to play, its not perfect but its pretty close. Controls are intuitive, responsive and work well with either mouse/keyboard or controller. There are many choices to be made throughout the game with real consequences, factions will favour you or attack you depending on your actions and alignment with other factions. There are many different playstyles and strategies to Skyrim, finding what works best for you is all part of the fun. Skills and abilities progress as you use them so you aren't completely restricted to a class such as mage or ranger, want to use a little bit of magic but also kill with a bow - no problem. Skyrim is often compared to its predecessors (Oblivion and Morrowind) to highlight some of flaws in the game, and while its true to say some of the missions and areas feel overused (oh? another cave filled with draugr you say?) and there are other occasional glitches, considering the massive scope and scale of the game these seem fairly minor. Skryim in certain ways surpasses its predecessors and is at very least well deserving of its place in this legendary series. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Story[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]So much detail, so much depth, the lore and background to the Elder Scrolls series is second to none. In Skyrim there are huge libraries packed with books containing everything from children's stories to hidden tomes of magic to the history of the lands. Talking to the people you meet tells of their individual struggles and also adds to the overarching story of a land rife with conflict and caught in far reaching changes of which you find your character the center. Skyrim is rich with background and story, as you explore and interact with the characters around you its very easy to feel part of the world. Quests are (with a few minor exceptions) interesting, challenging and varied with each of them building your understanding of the world and your place in it.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Replayability[/td]\n    [td]10[/td]\n    [td]You only need to look at the number of hours people put into this game to realise how much Skyrim has to offer. Personally I had already completed this game many times before I got it on steam and was still able to get many more hours of enjoyment than the average rpg, I'm sure it wont be the last time I play Skyrim either. Modding here also helps immensely with the community creating a huge collection of different locations, characters and quests. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]An outstanding game, if you haven't tried it then your missing out on a truly amazing gaming experience. The DLC's available (Dragonborn and Dawnguard) are worthwhile playing and some mods will require them (so pick up the GOTY if you can).[/td]\n  [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/fancy_fishie/recommended]More reviews by Fancy Fish[/url]\n[i]Agree / Disagree?

It looks amazing. There are all sorts of ways to play through it - no classes to chose from, just whatever style you like. Your character race doesn't hinder you - there are only various bonuses, not any penalties, to all of them. If you want, you can skip the main storyline (and avoid the associated dragon attacks, if you're too much of a milk-drinker to handle them) and become an archmage, the leader of a mercenary band, a master thief, or the greatest assassin to ever live. Heck, if you really want, you can just wander from town to town, picking crops for farmers and drinking your nights away at taverns.\n\nThere are countless dungeons, caves, forts, and ruins to explore, ranging from small to enormous (Blackreach could almost be its own game!). Many are linked to quests, but many are also just there if you feel like exploring the huge world of Skyrim.\n\nUnlike many games with DLC, the main expansions for Skyrim (Dawnguard and Dragonborn) are actually worthwhile and I highly recommend getting (Hearthfire...eh, not so much). Fans of Morrowind will love visiting Solstheim in Dragonborn - personally, I prefer it over Skyrim itself.\n\nThat said...the game does have a few...issues.\n\nI'll be honest: it's buggy. Like, there are obscene numbers of bugs. Normally this would be a deal-breaker for me and a game, but Skyrim is so amazing that it makes up for it. Still, you'll want to save often, because while most bugs are minor (a miscellaneous quest being impossible to finish, for example, leaving it in your quest log and messing with your OCD), some are game-breaking. The severe bugs are fairly rare, though. And since you're playing on PC, you have access to the glorious console commands that can fix nearly any problem - just consult the Elder Scrolls wiki and most issues can be handled easily enough. There's plenty of mods that fix things, too.\n\nThe game is almost TOO huge. There are so many quests available that you might become paralyzed with indecision regarding what to do next. It feels weird to be like \"hang on, I'll continue trying to save the world AFTER I help this old man find a magic bottle\". Those with OCD and 100% completion complexes might have a hard time with this game...I swear, I'm all but compelled to pick every flower I see on the roadside while traveling for sweet, sweet alchemy.\n\nSome features can be annoying or downright terrible. Random dragon attacks can kill NPCs, yes, but despite what some people whine about, they are NOT super-common. If you have Dawnguard, though, random vampire attacks on towns can really screw things up by killing important NPCs - I highly recommend getting a mod to stop them (there's also mods for reducing/stopping dragon attacks). With the mod, Dawnguard is great (crossbows are amazing). Without it, it's infuriating.\n\nThe game can range from being insanely difficult (enemies generally are leveled to the player, but some dungeons/quests just seem far too difficult for your character at times...I'm looking at you, Proving Honor) to ridiculously easy (once you're level 50 or so, you're virtually a god unless you've only leveled up non-combat skills). My recommendation for new players is to start on Adapt difficulty (the default) and crank it up whenever you go a day or two without fearing for your life. Lower difficulties are for wimps...unless the game bugs out and sends an Ancient Dragon at you when you're in your 20's (theoretically shouldn't happen...but over the 4000+ hours I've played this game, I've seen a lot of \"impossible\" stuff happen).\n\nFollowers can help you immensely, especially at low levels when you're still all squishy (word of advice: avoid bears until you're at least level 15 or so. They're more dangerous than dragons to low-level characters. Seriously). But their AI can be...let's say, special, at times. If you're both melee characters, you'll often have them gleefully running in front of your attacks. Mage followers might decide to cast Chain Lightning, which hits the target and any other nearby people - including you, if you're close enough. They don't know how to handle certain terrain or dungeons, so you may have to have them wait at the entrance for you to come back, or send them home. Still, some of them are very likable (especially Serana in the Dawnguard DLC), and there's so many that you're bound to find a good sidekick if you'd rather not travel Skyrim alone.\n\nBut overall, Skyrim is amazing, and like I said, the best game ever made thus far. If you want to play something that will easily occupy you for literally hundreds of hours, this is it.\n\nTalos guide you.", "timestamp_created": 1537781233, "timestamp_updated": 1537781233, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 50, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795440614223480225", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45289038": {"recommendationid": "45289038", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104933810", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 164834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545686784}, "language": "english", "review": "spent a few hours, ok i guess", "timestamp_created": 1539654368, "timestamp_updated": 1539654368, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 268, "weighted_vote_score": "0.833014905452728271", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37963352": {"recommendationid": "37963352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148070952", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 29647, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1534058413}, "language": "english", "review": "nobody's gonna see this review", "timestamp_created": 1512081192, "timestamp_updated": 1512081192, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 665, "votes_funny": 575, "weighted_vote_score": "0.873359084129333496", "comment_count": 30, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40908060": {"recommendationid": "40908060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198297143771", "num_games_owned": 94, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 6340, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522723434}, "language": "english", "review": "A seven year old game still captivates me for hours upon hours on end, while a game bought last week i've already lost interest in.", "timestamp_created": 1521407643, "timestamp_updated": 1521407643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769543349742889404", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18180999": {"recommendationid": "18180999", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004051329", "num_games_owned": 197, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 35733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481684845}, "language": "english", "review": "if you want it, there's a mod for it.\nif you don't want it, there's a mod for it.\nif you mod it (way too much), there's a chance to break it.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: Skyrim.", "timestamp_created": 1443153619, "timestamp_updated": 1443153619, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 110, "votes_funny": 169, "weighted_vote_score": "0.81229865550994873", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42753326": {"recommendationid": "42753326", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197114098", "num_games_owned": 53, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 30066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549763145}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10.  My favorite game of all time.  I did not receive any kind of sale on this game, but instead bought it for the full $40 or so.  I would do it again.  So worth it.\n\nThen again, it was kind of my introduction to gaming.  But let's get into it.  I apologize for the lengthy review, but my love for this game is unending.\n\nGlitches: The only true negative remark I have about this game.  There are a lot of bugs (and no, I don't mean torchbugs).  It's typical of Bethesda.  But the thing is, I almost like the game better with them.  It's kind of a familiarity thing - trademark of Skyrim - and it's oftentimes hilarious.  The only dangerous bug, really, is game crashes.  These don't happen super often for me, but they can screw up your progress if you're not careful.  Easy fix: Save often.\n\nGraphics: Beautiful.  I mean, this world is gorgeous.  No matter if you play the vanilla game - the scenery is just breathtaking!  Textures are gorgeous too.  I love walking around and just inspecting every little thing and just appreciating the detail (probably why I've spent over 450 hours in-game).  Skyrim runs perfectly on my laptop, which has an i5 6200U CPU that runs at about 2.4Ghz and has an Intel HD 520 graphics card.  This is a higher-end game that works on low-end machines.  People are beautiful, too, by the way.  The faces of Oblivion and Morrowind - God bless them - were horrific without mods, but vanilla Skyrim has some of the most appealing visages out there.  If you've played TES III and IV, you'll see that the Khajiit and Argonian faces have dramatically improved.\n\nWorld: Vast.  Skyrim is huge.  I can't say for certain how much bigger it is, but as I believe, it's bigger than Oblivion.  You can GET LOST in Skyrim.  That's the joy of it.  It's also everlastingly beautiful.  Everything: Trees, water, sky (with weather, mind you), towering white peaks, endless meadows, serene snowy woods.  Grazing elk, thundering mammoths, and...of course...dragons.  Horses are also another big plus.  They're artfully designed, strong, and perfect for crossing the province. \n And everywhere you go, you can usually hear wind.  It just FEELS cold to walk through Skyrim (as it should!).  And when you go inside, the fires always seem warmer than a screen image ever should.\n\nStory: Fantastic!  This is perhaps the best part of Skyrim.  You can be whomever you wish, do whatever you wish, and go wherever you wish.  If you want to just strike off after the intro and never complete another main storyline quest, you can.  Or you can follow the main quest all the way through and get some awesome content and lore and meet intriguing characters.  Whichever way you choose (and I've traversed most of the paths), the ending will actually be satisfying.  You will leave with closure, but the world will still be there to explore further, as always.\n\nLore: Rich.  Books can be found everywhere - in libraries, homes, caves, chests, in the pockets of wistful Stormcloak guards...And they are replete with history and lore about Tamriel and so much more.  There are some books from previous TES games as well as new ones.  Then there are personal journals of madmen and leaders, history lessons from various wise folk, and events you hear about that are definite Easter eggs to previous Elder Scrolls games.  Of course, there are also tomb carvings you can try to decipher or just stare at in confusion.  They tell a story too, though.  The politics of Skyrim during the fourth era really spice things up, too.\n\nAI: NPCs in Skyrim have some pretty good AI capabilities.  In its time, especially, this was probably one of the aspects of the game that set it apart.  Even now, 7 years later, the NPCs are still pretty advanced.  They're great!  Sure, everybody tries to tell you what they do for a living, their deepest fears, their biggest dreams, even if you don't give a crap...but they're interesting - and varied.  That's one thing that Morrowind especially lacked: Variation in its NPC dialogue.  And every individual Skyrim is different - not just every class.  You talk to Ysolda in Whiterun, and you'll find she's very different from a merchant in, say, Riften.\n\nCombat/mechanics:  Fighting feels smooth and impactful.  Every blow you deal feels solid, and every arrow sinks in just right.  Sprinting is a really nice feature that Oblivion and Morrowind don't have.  This may be one aspect where I give a tiny thumbs-down (like, grasshopper-tiny).  In this game, in normal difficulty, you can literally hack at something until it dies, or shoot it a million times with your steel arrows until it finally succumbs to your superior button-smashing.  However, the real fun comes when you put the difficulty on master or legendary - then all that flies out the window.  Then you actually have to think about what you're doing and use your weapon, the environment, and your knowledge to eliminate foes.  So, really, not a thumbs-down at all.\n\nDungeons: I love a good bandit raid.  Puzzles, however, could use some touching up.  If you're looking for a game that challenges your intellect, this really isn't it.  You can technically get through every dungeon just by plowing through.  You have to personally force yourself not to in order to challenge yourself with the puzzles.  I don't personally think they're that hard.  You might like them, though.  I just want the gold at the end; I really don't care how hard it is to reach.\n\nRealism: This game can be incredibly realistic.  The look of it, the feel of it, the interactions with NPCs - all of it creates a very tangible world.  With mods, that can be exponentially outdone.  And that's another thing - Skyrim is an insanely moddable game.  There are hundreds of mods on nexusmods that improve textures, interaction, mechanics, and realistic living.  My only gripe at the realism of the game is in the degradation of items.  Armor and weapons last forever, which isn't realistic at all.  In Oblivion and Morrowind both, you had to repair items or they would be broken and not have any usefulness.  But I believe there's a mod to compensate for that, so I can't complain.\n\nVersatility: You can be whomever you want.  This game is top-notch for creative minds like mine who long for stories within stories, worlds within worlds.  There are all ten races to choose from, and each one is incredibly customizable.  As far as who you become, the system is rigged so that whatever you physically DO in the game, you progress in.  If you use a bow a lot, you gain in archery.  If you mix a lot of potions (or skooma, admit it), you gain alchemy skills.  It's fun to play through exclusively as a warrior, work out all the kinks of that profession, then start all over again with a new character and practice magic exclusively.  You can actually do everything in one go, in fact.  My first playthrough, I started out as a warrior, then became a thief, then joined the Dark Brotherhood, then became a mage.  Literally.  Whatever you learn in the world, as long as you live, you can do anything and everything.  Nothing is set in stone.  Which may be a turnoff for some people.  For me, it was an opportunity like no other.\n\nDLC/mods: Like I said, this game is incredibly moddable.  Without the mods, though, the DLC is extremely immersive.  Hearthfire gives the opportunity for marriage and housing.  It really brings out the most that a single-player game has to offer.  You can literally build your entire life up in Skyrim.  With some survival mods (Campfire especially), you can also hunt, craft, and camp.  Lots more to it, but that's the gist.  The Dragonborn DLC adds map area and extra content that is actually kind of mind-twisting.  Finally, Dawnguard brings the vampires' story into the picture.  It's incredible.\n\nTime for me to shut up.  If you are a fan of all or even half of the things I just described, definitely give this game a try.
