Even a year after playing it all the way through, some aspects of the underlying story still stick with me.  I won't speak much to gameplay, because while I enjoyed the game immensely that wasn't what made this a true experience.  All of the BioShock games were excellent and a great journey - certainly at the top of my list for enjoyment.  Infinite was a little different though.  For me, it was the visually impactful segments and the deeply moving moments throughout.  Everyone connects with storytelling differently, but this one resonated with me a great deal.  For reference, my beloved list of games like this one are F.E.A.R. Perseus Mandate and 2, Dead Space 3, Mass Effect 2, Dragon Age II, Syberia I and II, The Longest Journey and Dreamfall, Half Life 2, Unreal II and a handful more.  This game was at the upper end of that list and I wish I could have stayed in the Infinite world for so much longer.  The ending for me was like the ending of the Hyperion/Endymion novel series - I understood it and knew at a visceral level that it was coming, but it took me a while to accept it because I was so invested in the main characters and I didn't want them to go.  It is so rare for a story to sit inside me casting around for a place to rest amongst my values and character.  In 40 years, I have experienced this with a very small collection of books, movies and games.

You know that feeling, at the end of a great book or movie or TV show or whatever, and for a moment you wonder \"wait, is it really over?\" And then you try to convince yourself that it's not, and you try to find any way at all to fill that sudden void. I don't know, maybe that feeling's new to you. Play Bioshock Infinite to feel it, I guess.\n\nRewind. I had heard of Bioshock, knew it was some kind of x-punk techno-fantasy kind of world known for rich story and character development. I never picked it up though because, well, sometimes the time just never feels right to pick something up. I started with Infinite off a whim. The first ten minutes took my breath away. And I spent the next several hours trying to get it back and failing, all the way until the credits rolled their way across the screen.\n\nThe music is beautiful. The scenery is beautiful. The dialogue is beautiful. There's a bonding between the setting and the plot that I can't fully explain. I guess this is what people mean by \"immersion.\" Turns out you don't need some avatar you create to be fully immersed, no, all you need are characters you empathize with, who grip you by your mind, your heart, your soul, who rocket into your life from a different world and fade away just as abruptly.\n\nInterlude: the gameplay is technically well-done. I'm not one for FPSs generally, I mean, I'll play one but I'm not very GOOD at it. I wasn't very good at this game either but if Bioshock Infinite does one thing well gameplay-wise, it's offering the player choices. Do you want to run into every encounter guns-blazing? Do you want to stay back and judiciously use spells (ahem, vigors) to crowd control? Do you want to swing around a giant skyline raining bullets from on high before flipping down and sticking the landing with a spinning gear-shiv to the face? Mix and match to your heart's desire. Bioshock Infinite is a series of FPS set pieces with several options per encounter, although I'd say that once you find your groove, it's pretty easy to lock yourself into one way of doing things. Aside from combat, there's a minor exploration component, and this is where the game struggles just a little maintaining its shimmering veneer of immersive world-building. If all you had to do was walk around and explore the beautiful world the creators made for you, that would've been perfect, but for whatever reason the developers insisted on sticking in \"collectible bonuses\" in little nooks and crannies out of the way of the main plot to reward people for wandering like an aimless lunatic and digging through trash cans. Well, nothing's perfect.\n\nThe thing is, this game would be worth playing if it didn't have any gameplay at all. I'm serious. Just experiencing it completely passively would have been enough to make me feel similarly to how I feel now. But there's a certain extra factor gained by the interactivity afforded to the player. The stakes feel real. And Elizabeth, one of my favorite \"companion\" characters in a long time, by a long margin, feels like a real friend who you want to protect.

I've played countless amount of games in my lifetime, some that have given me very fond, happy memories. Some have given me grief, or regret, and some have made me feel... Sad, Attached.. Inspired. This is one of those few games that have made me feel this way.\n\nI can honestly say that I fell in love with this game from the first part. I won't spoil it but, the first area after the lighthouse? Oh it's beautiful. I think I just stood there and walked around listening to that song, looking at the scenery as it played. I got really attached at that point. \n\nThe story, to me, is like.. when you want to play a game and you want it to have a really good story, and something that makes sense and seems worth your time. That's definitely this story. I could go on and on about how fantastic this game is, but I think if you're on the edge of purchasing it, then definitely do so. It could honestly change your life. I know it has for me. \n\nIt seems a bit silly, as this is just a game to some, but I believe that games are a form of artwork, and with artwork, you can produce certain feelings and messages to give to the receivers. \n\nThis is my favorite game of all time, and it will always be forever now. It holds a very special place in my heart... I'll never forget it.\n\nStory: 11/10 (Seriously, it's breathtaking)\n\nGraphics: 10/10 (I'm a sucker for the art-style, heh)\n\nAudio: 8/10 (Sometimes, very very very rarely the audio would mess up and sound like it was underwater or something. \nPretty sure that's on my end though, as it happened with another game too)\n\nGameplay: 8/10 (The combat is quite fun, it's very different from what you may be used to, it's like.. crisp. If that makes sense.)\n\n[h1] Wholeheartedly recommend this game. :) [/h1]\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1507523876, "timestamp_updated": 1507523876, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.821027636528015137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41013584": {"recommendationid": "41013584", "author": {"steamid": "76561198324742144", "num_games_owned": 380, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 881, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529970214}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Booker, are you afraid of god?\"\n\"No. \n...But I'm afraid of you.\"\n\n11/10 Best steampunk game I ever played.", "timestamp_created": 1521889406, "timestamp_updated": 1521889406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 101, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858350217342376709", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9260361": {"recommendationid": "9260361", "author": {"steamid": "76561198012774835", "num_games_owned": 1850, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1476, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527354345}, "language": "english", "review": "[i] BioShock Infinite has a great story and gameplay, but what's exactly BioShock Infinite?

The game takes place in 1912 and it's hella atmospheric.\n\n[i] \"When I first seen Columbia, that sky was the brightest, bluest sky that there ever was. Seemed like Heaven. Then your eyes adjusted to the light, and you see that sea of white faces looking hard back at you.\" [/i]\n\n[h1] Fighting/guns [/h1]\nOther parts of the game are, of course, violence and shooting. The first in your hand will be the Sky-Hook, which will serve you both in combat and when moving in a flying city, and then firearms like Pistol, Sniper Rifle, Shotgun, Machine Gun and the great Hand Cannon. Weapons and abilities (vigors) can be improved. Sky-Hook's can completely change your play style when you shoot and move through the Skylines to the other side of the battlefield. This makes the fight a definitive 3D.\n\n[h1] Vigors [/h1]\nIn in the previous Bioshock games we had plasmids in the BioShock Infinite you'll have vigors. Vigors are of different kinds like lightning, fire, etc. But you will find it by yourself.\n\n[h1] Elizabeth [/h1]\nI have already mentioned Elizabeth, who has the finest eyes in the world, and will help you in the fight when she look for an ammunition or a medical supplies and believe or not but that will be very helpful in your fights. She can also open space-time cracks.\nElizabeth girl you fall in love with, girl who stand by your side for the whole story. \nThe story is fascinating, but telling something more would be very bad, so I recommend everyone to play it.\n\n[spoiler] \"Bring us the girl, and wipe away the debt.\" [/spoiler]\n\n[h1] Overall [/h1]\nAnyone who played this game before will understand that the shooter style is good, but the best thing is when the story comes to the word.

The game let's you choose most of the time whether to shoot or to stay in stealthy mode, looking out for threats and staying in shadows.\n\nThe characters are easy to identify with.\nYou just want to sit and keep playing, because the story is so entertaining and addictive.\nYou want to see what's next, what is behind the next corner, what kind of enemies will you face.\n\nAnd, to be honest, there are merely no games without any bugs nowadays.\nI am talking about visual bugs, possible glitches and getting out of bounds.\nThe bugs i got never killed me or prevented me to continue my adventure.\nFor example, sometimes NPCs walked on places where they shouldn't have walked, Like on walls.\n\nBut if you're into that kind of stuff, like i am, you're gonna find yourself going to places you were not supposed to go, and trying to find your way inside buildings, or outside areas, where you never was meant to be at.\n\nWhen i realized the credits were about to roll, i was a bit disappointed about the length of the game.\nIt took me 14 hours to complete all the side missions, and main quest.\n\nIt's not a long game, but it's very enjoyable. There's a lot of replay value too. Personally, that was one of the best Singleplayer shooters i've ever played. Totally recommended.\n\nThanks for reading, hopefully this helped.\n\n-Nate", "timestamp_created": 1469890507, "timestamp_updated": 1469890507, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.794334709644317627", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34469103": {"recommendationid": "34469103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198195935279", "num_games_owned": 68, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1503600932}, "language": "english", "review": "Well, clearly i made a mistake for ignoring this in these years. I'm not familiar with last parts of Bioshock series. So Bioshock Infinite is my first experience. So i have realized this is the crown jewel of this series in my opinion. Let me share my thoughts about it on some very aspects.\n\n[i]8.5/10.0, An illustrious and distinguished experience - Aaron[/i]\n[i]Percentage of Expectancy : 89%[/i]\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\nSo far, i would love to say that the story is the key feature of this title. They have taken the story to another level. It's entirely unpredictable and immersive story. Like a story that could make turn at any time. It has been affiliated with heavenly theme with steampunk mechanism which is obvisouly unique. I loved how they affined multiple continues in the story. Could break my mind to figure the core of the story but everything figures at the end. i actually inflicted outstanding focus to know every sequences. Story went through some flashbacks and clamity moments that's what took the story in my mind. Nothing has been rushed or unexplained in this story. Everything was connected to the fullest extent. Even all the dialogues are well written. So it's worked out pretty well so far.\n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\nFrom my experience, the whole gameplay is arisen on heavenly world and steampunk theme. There are countless collectibles around the map. Most of the collectibles are important for our play and the other collectibles are included for achievements. So genuinely these collectibles keeps you busy throughout your whole experience. Like you can look around and collect multiple substance in every spots if you want. About abilities, main character could gain some deadly and remarkable abilities and those abilities known as Virgos. We can use these virgos to have great advantage in combat. But it requires replenishing content just like your health. Then comes our iconic companion, Elizabeth who helps me with Ammo, Health Kit, Virgos replenishing Salt whenever you come at shortage. Also Silver Eagle which means in game currency. So she completes an invaluable preamble in your whole experience. About combat, it's way too enjoyable and mind freaking. Also quite challenging at very stages. Some hostiles are kind of complex to eliminate like Fireman, Handyman and Patriot. That's why i loved to play it again and again. Mostly because it has put me in different situations so it was truly amazing to play.\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\nAs this title was created 4 years ago so i'm quite satisfied with the visuals. You can't expect it to have spanking mechanism but you'll love it. They have put some cool facial details on every characters though. So initially, this is a great looking title for that age.\n\n[h1]Utility and Performance[/h1]\nJust found some creepy bugs around but no errors, crashes or anything else. Those bugs were too annoying for me though. But i was cool with them.About performance, i got solid 60 FPS with ultra presets on Intel Core i7 7700K, R9 390 STRIX and 6GB Ram. So this is completely auspicious.\n\n[h1]Favorite Feature[/h1]\nI can replay any chapters of this story with any difficulty. That's what i want in every game. So this is my favorite feature.\n\nSo guys, i'm humbly recommending you this title. Find an excuse and let Bioshock Infinite off the chain.

The characters are well developed, the score very well done and placed, the dialog very well written, and the ending exceedingly perfect. You are missing out on a lot of the story, if you do not play the two Burial at Sea additions. \n\nThe not being able to save bothered me at first, but I found that it actually helped to keep me from forgetting important immersion points, from how it begins each chapter. The method is actually an improvement, in my opinion, as opposed to the save anywhere option. The challenging difficulty was fantastic. I had immense trouble at some points, making it require actually strategy, instead of just banging your head against a wall until you get through. While that might work at times, and the Clash in the Clouds addition does feel like that, this game benefits the person who uses a methodical approach, rather than guns blazing.\n\nI have read some have become of sudden experts on quantum physics, and they dismiss the ending of the main game. From Doctor Who, Star Trek, Time Machine and many other movies who have done such ideas of paradoxes, there is no straight answer to how it could or could not work. I did feel a bit at odds with the ending, despite it being very well done from its own individual point, but having playing Burial at Sea 1 and 2, I can now say the writers of this game, and the additional content, are simply amazing.\n\nWhile I hear rumors of a fourth addition to the Bioshock series, and I hope that it does come to fruition, this series could end respectfully here. \n\nIn short, this is a must play game, if nothing else, for the story. You will need to have played the first Bioshock to get the fullness of the story, though Bioshock 2 is just filler, it is a worthy part of the series as well, if you enjoyed the first and third part of the series.", "timestamp_created": 1517324591, "timestamp_updated": 1517324591, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.722990155220031738", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35935863": {"recommendationid": "35935863", "author": {"steamid": "76561198170641595", "num_games_owned": 292, "num_reviews": 67, "playtime_forever": 2551, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529547061}, "language": "english", "review": "When the ending slaps you in the face", "timestamp_created": 1508725109, "timestamp_updated": 1508725109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 90, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.802626252174377441", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26965345": {"recommendationid": "26965345", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074783402", "num_games_owned": 3032, "num_reviews": 59, "playtime_forever": 1381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490067181}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]I nominate Irrational Games' [b]BioShock Infinite[/b] for [b]The \u201cWhoooaaaaaaa, dude!\u201d Award[/b] category in The Steam Awards 2016![/h1]\n\nWell, what can I say?

Whilst my hours on steam don't reflect my actual playing time, as I've completed this game way too many times on my PS3, I just can't express how much I love this. It's my favourite ever game, and here's why:\n\n1) [b]The plot is incredible, and has real substance.[/b] I've never completed a game more than once before, because I find playing the same story line tiring. However, this is an exception. The story line is phenomenal. I find myself being totally, and utterly, immersed in the world of Columbia. I have a real sense of \"belonging\" within the game which sounds a bit weird, but I don't really know how I can explain it. Brooker DeWitt and Elizabeth are both very strong characters, with great backstories, and the way these stories collide with each other is thought provoking, fantastically executed and cleverly directed.\n\n2) [b]The graphics are visually stunning.[/b] The joy of playing this game with ultra settings, is one to be behold. If you're looking for a game with a wealth of detail, this is the one. Characters and scenery look great in the cut scenes and during game play. The lighting is just right throughout, and to me, fire has never before looked so good.\n\n3) [b]The characters are strong, witty, and badass.[/b] And whoever voiced the characters need a medal, because I couldn't imagine anyone else stepping up to deliver what these guys have delivered. \n\n4) [b] Combat. Is. Awesome.[/b] I never really liked gore in a game before, but I really enjoyed this, with just the right amount of gore included. Not just that, it's really easy to pick up which I love, and seem to have trouble with in other games.\n\nThe only real criticism I can think of is the lack of DLC's available, and wishing that the story went on just that little bit longer. I didn't want it to end. Other than that, I really can't fault it. You're not just buying a game here, you're literally buying an entire world.

Bioshock Infinite is probably my favorite game so far. How exactly I am going to show my love and appreciation for the whole Bioshock series and this entry, in particular? By writing a positive review and bolstering the ranks of the rest of the 50K? Yeah, Imma do that.[/i]\n\n[h1]TL;DR[/h1] I greatly enjoyed Bioshock Infinite and all of its aspects. The story and setting are excellently done, the gameplay is quite great, and I especially appreciate its steampunk beauty, so different from gloomy Rapture. Yes, the theme of travelling between universes is a tricky one and may bring a lot of plotholes - as well as resolutions to them; and this theme is what makes the plot so delicious. I recommend the game without any doubt to anyone willing to pay attention to the story.\n\n[h1][b]Bioshock Infinite[/b] is a masterpiece. [/h1]\n\nI love [b]the intricate and complex plot and storyline[/b] that will not miss a beat in hitting you with constant waves of enjoyment and wondering, delivering a deep emotional experience. Toying with time-space warping concept may not be a good design decision, but in Bioshock Infinite it pays off. Yes, it can add a lot of confusion and possible plot holes to the story. Yes, there may be some \"deus ex machina\" moments regarding infinite universes, and where an explanation which is only somewhat good covers what can work in there and what can't. And yes, it also makes the plot so deliciously, deliciously wonderful as it is.\n\nI adore the immersive [b]retro-sci-fi steampunk setting[/b] and feast my eyes on the [b]breathtaking visuals[/b] of a beautiful flying city of Columbia, and I like how these visuals gradually change to depict the current state of the story. Starting from the beginning till the very end, you will be captivated by the charming color palette so different from gloomy Rapture. The level design is gorgeous, and there is a possibility to explore, to look for collectibles such as voxophones that explain the story and lore more in detail.\n\nI admire [b]the characters[/b] and [b]their development[/b] (and their looks, of course), the journey, in which that grim war veteran turned Pinkerton and a mysterious, naive but ultimately adorable girl evolve, exploring the impact of their past on them and their impact on the future. Hell, I don't even consider Comstock to be the main villain.\n\nI relish [b]the gameplay[/b], in which the player has a multitude of ways to approach his enemies - be that blazing them down from a skyline, staying at the safe distance using long-range weapons, vigors (a.k.a. plasmids, a.k.a. magic) and Tears (another kind of inter-dimensional magic), or fight up close and personal, using all of their mighty arsenal. Vigors are what really makes the difference, as it replaces Plasmids from the previous entries, but adds much more variety and feels much more fun, in fusion with Tears. The restriction to carrying only two guns at a time only increases the tension. And with introduction of sky-hooks, Bioshock has never felt so great with added vericality.\n\nWith all that said, Bioshock Infinite makes one of the best games of the decade for me.\nI whole-heartedly recommend this game to anyone. Buy it, have fun, and don't forget to pay attention.\n[u][i]\"Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt.\"[/i][/u]\n\nP.S. Don't miss the DLCs. They are one of the best additions to original games I've seen. The Burial at Sea episodes expand the connection between Columbia and Rapture, and are a great emotional conclusion to the series.\n\n[b]Thank you, Irrational Games.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1531562152, "timestamp_updated": 1532107528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 19, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.712880969047546387", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18599915": {"recommendationid": "18599915", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074552459", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11813, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1535564875}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm grateful this game exists", "timestamp_created": 1445435100, "timestamp_updated": 1445435100, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 357, "votes_funny": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841271102428436279", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23837959": {"recommendationid": "23837959", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059997689", "num_games_owned": 113, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3206, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489360289}, "language": "english", "review": "Wish I could erase my memory and play through it again.

I'm not too late to write a review for this am I? Nah, let's get started! First here's a short GOODS and NOT-SO-GOODS list to give you a basic idea of all the pro's and cons of the game. If you're looking for a more in-depth review you can scroll to the bottom.\n\nGOODS:\n+ Plot. It gets more complex and intruiging as the story goes on but it never feels TOO overwhelming. The pacing and the \"show don't tell\" approach make it a fantastic experience.\n+ Setting. The world of Columbia is amazingly stylized and if you can suspend your disbelief a little it becomes surprisingly immersive. The game also looks beautiful as I'm sure you can tell.\n+ Writing. There's a lot of character in the main cast, but even background characters have well-recorded lines that add more depth to the world you're in. Dialogue in proper dosages.\n+ Challenigng combat. I know for many this is a controversial subject of the game; \"Ludonaritive Dissonance\" and all that but I'm going to be easy here: it's fun. I think the violence fits the game fine and doesn't feel out of place. It starts of simple but get's more challenging as the game goes on. Read more about this below.\n+ Unique. Though some would argue it doesn't innovate at all; Bioshock Infinite still manages to combine all it's aspects to deliver a truly novel experience.\n+ Music and atmosphere. This game seems carefully crafted with a great sense of detail. This shines through in both the music and how most 'scenes' in the game play out. I'm sure it was playtested a lot.\n+ DLC is decent. I was personally disappointed by Burial at Sea (save for the amazing first look at a \"living\" Rapture) But in the end I found Clash in the Clouds, the more basic \"survival arena\" mode, to be far more entertaining then first anticipated. \n+ It's archaic and a bit bare-bones; but your abilities can be upgraded as you progress. More health, salts, shield and the possibility to upgrade your guns and vigors isnt much but it's enough to keep you trying to find more cash in the flying city. \n+ Proper options and difficulty settings so you can make the game as easy or hard as you want it to be. I believe the achievements are fun for the completionists among us.\n\nNOT-SO-GOODS\n- As hinted before: people might think there is \"ludonarritive dissonance\" as they believe the gratuitous violence doesn't fit the main characters of the game; Elizabeth and Booker. I do NOT agree. But since many people do feel that way it has to be mentioned. More below.\n- A limited experience as it's a single player game with a very linear plot. Very little room to explore or follow your own path. Goes double for the Burial at Sea DLC. It's a VERY solid linear experience though, just sad there's no big replay value for the common gamer.\n- The standard combat music get's really repetitive after a while. Such a shame as the rest of the game's score is great.\n- Some people dislike the \"narrative through scattered audio logs\"-cliche, which is understandable. It's a bit too \"easy\" I guess. Doesn't bother me much though! I'm one of those people who read all of 2016's DOOM''s logs and backstories and loved it. ^^; \n- People who know what this game looked like before release really hate how much was cut from the final product. You won't notice much if you're ignorant of it, but it's still a factor.\n- Elizabeth's design has a little bit too much \"Male gaze\" going on. Forgivable to some because her character as a whole is just great.\n- Far from the best combat we've seen from modern shooters. Thankfully this game has more to offer then just headshots.\n\nAnd that's all for the lists, I'll just go off on a small tangent on any thing I couldn't mention and that'll be everything. Let me start by adressing the \"ludonarrative dissonance\"-issue: I believe people make too many assumptions. They say Booker acts too kind for the horrible things he does. Columbia looks too pretty to be a bad place. Elizabeth is too sweet to make some of the decisions she does. I got one simlpe retort: appearances can be deceiving is one of the central subjects of the game. And how many times have we heard of nice people that have done horrible things either because they were forced to, had no other choice or had to do something drastic to protect the things they held dear? And with that I say; there is no ludonaritive dissonance. Just people with poor knowledge of how complex human beings and their feelings are, their lack of understanding is not because of the game but because of themselves.\n\nI believe the 'limited' combat is great. Many people really disliked the fact you can only hold 2 weapons at all times but to me it just felt like I had to prepare better when I was out of combat while also improvising when you're in the heat of battle with the weapons that your enemies drop. You don't have an entire catalog of explosives on you to get you out of any hairy situation that pops up; sometimes you just need to survive by the skin of your teeth so you better learn to do do both preperation and improvisation to be succesfull. Also makes it more interesting when you choose your favourite weapons to upgrade.\n\nAnd finally I'd like to mention; (SPOILERS) the ending makes no sense according to the game's own rules. Many Youtube video's try to explain it all, but the answer is simple: the writers just bit off a bit more then they could chew. There's an infinite amount of Bookers and Elizabeths; drowning one Booker in a few timelines won't change that. On top of that: Elizabeth would never have her timespace-warping abilities if Comstock never existed so it's a full paradox. If she actually did manage to kill all infinite versions of Booker she killed herself as well... which means she could've never grown up to... kill herself? Yeah, see what I mean? Burial at Sea makes this even more of a mess; but I should quit here before we get in too deep.\n(Get it? In too deep? Because Rapture's on the sea floor? No? Bad joke? Dammit!)\n\nSo that's all I have to say. In the end I absolutely recommend this title!\nIf you have any questions feel free to ask.

All the superpowers and gunplay of the first two, with an extra twist of quantum craziness.\n\nBioshock Infinite is similar to its two predecessors, yet quite different at the same time. It's still first person, but instead of playing the classic silent protagonist, you're now in the role of Booker DeWitt, a jaded private eye tasked to \"bring back the girl and wipe away the debt.\" You still get plenty of cool powers by drinking strange glowing fluids, but they're called Vigors instead of Plasmids. Most of all, the story is a linear experience that still immerses you in the history and struggles of the place you find yourself in, granting context to the strange and often distressing idiosyncracies that define life in Columbia.\n\nThe game uses quantum mechanics and multiverse theory liberally, explaining everything from why the city of Columbia stays up in the air to what Elizabeth's unique powers do. Elizabeth is the young woman Booker has been tasked to retrieve, and operates simultaneously as the \"princess in the tower\" and \"deus ex machina.\" As such she is naive but possesses astounding potential, able to actualize other possibilities by opening up \"tears\" much like someone might open a window or a door. Thankfully, rather than being a game-length escort mission, Elizabeth contributes significantly to the fight by tossing Booker supplies when he's low and actualizing cover and turrets on a whim. As a result, there's actual value that she provides to the player, further reinforcing the connection between Booker and Elizabeth through the games mechanics. \n\nHowever, there are several major changes that set Infinite apart from Bioshock 1 and 2. Combat is more vertical than before thanks to the addition of skyhooks and rails, allowing you to zip around the level and reach areas in the more open environments around Columbia. Upgrading is now entirely based on money, rather than requiring ADAM to upgrade your powers. You can't hack like before, so hostile turrets either need to be destroyed or possessed to avoid getting gunned down. \n\nAs for the use of voiced characters, particularly in the protagonist role, it's a a mixed blessing. On the one hand, there's actual dialogue between the main characters, and the story is stronger for having those moments between Booker and Elizabeth. On the other hand though, the narrative dissonance is more noticeable than before as well, particularly when Booker goes from providing insightful commentary on the conflict to scavenging corpses and garbage for any stray bit of food or coin he can find. \n\nThe narrative is excellent on its own and is made even better with the Burial at Sea DLC, which helps officially connect Infinite to the stories of Bioshock 1 and 2. The quantum silliness in Infinite sometimes make it difficult to keep causality straight, but it's fascinating seeing the \"constants and variables\" between Rapture and Columbia explained in depth. \n\nUltimately, Bioshock Infinite is a worthy conclusion to the series, taking the frantic fights and heady story of its predecessors and adding in some new mechanics so the experience feels fresh. Definitely worth a play for anyone that enjoys first person shooters with strong narratives.", "timestamp_created": 1529374069, "timestamp_updated": 1529374069, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.709317862987518311", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23441902": {"recommendationid": "23441902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231467140", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 4123, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 50, "last_played": 1551401997}, "language": "english", "review": "You know it's a good game when you finish it and immediately after you need to play it again", "timestamp_created": 1465333364, "timestamp_updated": 1465333364, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 117, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.861125588417053223", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17440455": {"recommendationid": "17440455", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007590020", "num_games_owned": 598, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 400, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438966451}, "language": "english", "review": "It starts off well, then it gets really weird, then it becomes really dark, then there's a lot of shooting and then you get mind fucked.

And if you were to ever miss any Voxophones, Telescopes or Kinetoscopes,  you can simply go to \"Load Chapter\" and select the chapter you believe you missed it on and collect it.

The product Irrational Games showcased at E3 2010 is significantly different compared to the product that's available to the consumer.\n\n\nNot every game has to have more than one ending, stealth mechanics, weapon customization, a third person player view, character customization, a variety of meaningful choices, manual save mechanics, modification development tools or have no scripted moments to be a decent game.

This is exactly the reason i choose Bioshock Infinite. Bioshock infinite manages to put down a really good atmosphere just like part 1 and 2, it's kinda like this 1800's overly happy/goodlife style. And except for 1 or 2 horror atmospheric parts i really enjoyed walking through the flying and colorful world of Columbia. The scenery in this game is so amazing and i found myself often just standing still and enjoying the view.\n\nOn to something different: The story and it's characters. Both are really interesting and well done. The story keeps itself interesting by introducing new things all game long. And by looting the world you'll find basic things like salt's, ammo, health etc. but also voxophones, these are audiofragments which expand on the story and give you more background information.  Someting i liked alot about Bioshock Infinite was the fact you travel with Elizabeth almost the whole game. It's something different, and although she doesnt really do much other than provide you with supplies and a bit of talking, it's better than traveling alone. However something you might need to do is search online for a explanation of the ending, because it's a really complex ending. There's alot of video's and sites explaining it, so it shouldn't be a problem finding something about it.\n\nOverall Bioshock Infinite is a amazing game, great story, great characters, great mechanics and a wonderfull world to explore.

That doesn't mean all the others releases are bad but it's been a while since i had so much fun playing a game.\n\nThe plot it's one of the best i've seen in my entire gaming life, matching some Visual Novels and books i love (i kinda like a good plot and not the usual mindless action or generic shooting gallery we get most of the time). I don't think you'll find another game with a better quality plot anytime soon.\n\nGraphics aren't realistic but that doesn't mean they are bad, they got kinda a unique style that makes everything beautiful. You could say they are the same as the older games but they certainly improved a lot. However i kinda get annoyed with the excessive \"bloom\" in some scenes, sometimes they are overused to the point of blinding you. Aside from that everything else is beautiful. \n\nThere's the music, honestly it isn't great but it's not bad either, the combat music is the same for the whole game save some specific scenes and it gets repetitive after a while. It's average at best.\n\nThe gameplay is what you've already seen in BioShock 1 & 2 with some improvements. You can equip gears that gives you a few improvements like auto-casting lightning when you are struck or put your enemies on fire when you strike them with melee attacks.\n\nThere's the new \"Sky-Line\" mechanic that allows you to travel around the place and can even be used in your advantage during combat, your partner Elizabeth even rides with you.\n\nAnd talking about Elizabeth, that's one hell of a companion. She is like Alyx in Half-Life 2: Episode One but instead of fighting she gives you support during and outside combat like finding and giving you ammo, salt, money and even warning about points of interest and some missable items like lockpicks. I love when i'm almost out of ammo and she throws me some ammo, she also plays a huge role in the plot.\n\nHonestly i haven't cared about my companion in a single-player game since Alyx, she isn't useless like most companions who doesn't do jack aside from yelling at you all the time like 'AIM DOWN YOUR SIGHTS\", \" TAKE POINT\", \"THEY ARE KILLING US DO SOMETHING!!!\". \n\nPC port is above average, there isn't much graphics options but at least the game runs great, without vsync the game always run above 60fps (sometimes going up to 90fps) with everything maxed out and the game has some pretty graphics.\n\nIt took me around 13 hours to beat the game.\n\nMy rate: 9,5", "timestamp_created": 1420503227, "timestamp_updated": 1420503394, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 113, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.810828924179077148", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34592234": {"recommendationid": "34592234", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139672993", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 28, "playtime_forever": 2869, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548119018}, "language": "english", "review": "ARE YOU A DUKE OR A DIMWIT?\n\nDuke buys this game and enjoys it thoroughly\n\nDimwit gets it on G2A and leaves a negative review without playing it!\n\nBE THE DUKE, NOT THE DIMWIT.", "timestamp_created": 1504050315, "timestamp_updated": 1504050315, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720414519309997559", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "422317": {"recommendationid": "422317", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970525709", "num_games_owned": 87, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 22401, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545297327}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game. Not perfect but certainly one of the best games since HL2. Been so busy playing I forgot to recommend it! The heart of this story is the relationship between the two main characters Booker and Elizabeth. This is unlike BioShock were it was about the City of Rapture. It is a much more personal story. A story of regret about the choices you have made and how they change you.

This one will talk exclusively about the main game, while I'll write reviews for each of the DLCs. So, on to the review!\n\nWhat should I talk about first? I guess gameplay would be an important factor. In BioShock Infinite, the combat feels more frenetic; so to speak. Rather than focusing on exploration like the previous games, you'll usually move from one combat arena to the other; not literally, of course, there will be moments where you're free to explore a bit, but the game still feels pretty combat oriented. Not that it's something bad, considering that, in my opinion, the combat in this game is pretty good, with lots of options to dispatch enemies; from the different weapons, to the Vigors (Infinite's version of Plasmids), and Elizabeth's Tears. If there's something I'd complain about, though, is the fact that you're limited to carrying two weapons at the same time. Somewhat disappointing, but the variety of Vigors (and Vigor Combos) more than makes up for this. Also, the Sky-Hook is a great addition, allowing you to quickly move through certain areas, while also working as a melee weapon. Finally, there's the Tears. Elizabeth, who will be your companion for most of the game, can open them to bring things to help you out during combat, which is quite useful.\n\nAs for the story, well, it's pretty good in my opinion. It starts out somewhat \"normal\"; you're a guy sent to the city of Columbia to rescue a certain girl, but as it progresses, it gets more and more complex, in a good way. The characters are all pretty well written in my opinion, and a particular mention goes to the Lutece twins. Their dialogue always cracks me up a bit. Some people might feel that the main character, Booker, feels like a \"regular\" hero; you know, guy with a dark past, atoning for his sins, etc. Well, I'd say that's because, while being the playable character, Booker isn't the main character. The main character would be Elizabeth, and when you play through the game, it kinda makes sense. The story isn't about Booker's trip to Columbia, but rather about Elizabeth escaping from Columbia.\n\nAnd now, I'll dedicate a paragraph to Elizabeth. Like I mentioned above, I feel that the game is more about Elizabeth than about Booker. After all, she is kind of the driving force behind the plot; what moves it forward. And like I also mentioned, she'll be your companion for most of the game. Even then, the game doesn't feel like a long escort mission. During combat, Elizabeth helps you out; not fighting enemies directly, but by providing you supplies, opening tears to bring in help, and even warning you of powerful enemies. Outside combat, she'll wander on her own; not going too far away from you, but she'll still look at things that interest her, and might even find things you missed; she can also open doors for you through lockpicking. I think they did a great job at giving her a personality; she doesn't feel like another NPC at all, but rather as an actual person. Still, there are a few details here and there; just as an example, when lockpicking, she'll usually talk in a cheerful tone, which can feel out of place when, only a few minutes before, she was angry at Booker for something he did.\n\nThe environments are superb. The city of Columbia is a pretty beautiful place, and I can see why they went with the \"city in the sky\" theme rather than going back to the bottom of the ocean. Not to say that Rapture wouldn't have looked good; in fact, you'll get to visit it in its prime in Burial at Sea! However, having a different setting was interesting, with 1912's Columbia providing a nice contrast to 1950's Rapture. The level design, by itself, is pretty good; still, most of the places you'll visit feel like combat arenas, consisting of big, open spaces, unlike Rapture's labyrinth-like structure. The soundtrack is pretty good as well.\n\nWell, I think that's all I can say about BioShock Infinite. Personally, my favourite BioShock game is BioShock 2, but even then, I think Infinite is an excellent game, which is why I recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1478012653, "timestamp_updated": 1478041264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.72799980640411377", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24077793": {"recommendationid": "24077793", "author": {"steamid": "76561198082147343", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 829, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486116590}, "language": "english", "review": "\" Give us the girl, wipe away the debt \"\n\n+ Columbia is gorgeous \n+ Brilliant chemistry between Booker and Elizabeth\n+ Engaging gunplay \n+ Complex and great story\n+ The feeling you get when you find out how dark the game is\n+ One hell of an ending\n\n- Linear \n- Gets repetitive\n- Didn't find skylines that useful \n\nWith its currently low price, this game is a steal\n< 8.5 / 10 >\n", "timestamp_created": 1467631759, "timestamp_updated": 1467631759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 17, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.730855107307434082", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36431907": {"recommendationid": "36431907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032352680", "num_games_owned": 815, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 5001, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420684632}, "language": "english", "review": "This is an incredible game from start to finish!

One that begins to elevate storytelling in gaming. There will surely be a lot of discussion to follow with this one. There's a lot of care taken with the world in which it takes place in, as well as with some of the themes it handles. And Bioshock Infinite opts to hold very little back. Here you'll be tackling themes such as racism, religion, false prophets, gender roles, even moments that will test your own morals. It's got a lot to say. The story and the world also come to life in the same way that Rapture does. While Columbia is not as dazzling as the trip into the underwater world, it does have a pulse just the same. You'll find Voxphones scattered throughout. These, like the original Bioshocks audio diaries, add a lot more to the tale at hand. They add to the story, the world and the atmosphere. To ignore them is to miss out on a considerable portion of the game. For those very curious about the world they're playing in, they will most certainly want to pick these up.\n\nThe world of Columbia is wider and more open than the claustrophobic and enclosed Rapture, gun fights involve more enemies than the original Bioshock. The problem with this is that it devalues the fights itself. In the original Bioshock, enemies were something to fear. Even the most basic ones could do damage to you if you're not prepared. In Infinite, most enemies are just faceless guards who you just simply have to shoot in order to progress to other parts of the story. Most fights just end up repetitive, and though the game allows you to use various methods such as vigors and skyhooks to defeat enemies, rarely do you ever need to. Most of the game you're grossly overpowered, even if you're not upgrading your vigors or weapons.\n\nAnother thing, though admittedly it's a nitpick, the dissonance between the beautiful story and the violent shooting is something worth mentioning. Sometimes the dialogue and the \"breather\" scenes seem to be slightly disrupted by the high amounts of adrenaline shooting that follows. It's not enough to ruin the experience, but it's certainly something that could be done better. Less emphasis on gunplay and maybe some more exploration elements could benefit this game.\n\nBioshock Infinite isn't a perfect game, but it is a great one. A thematically ambitious game with a well told story, Bioshock Infinite is sure to delight fans who fell in love with the original back in 2007. It is a game that not only delivers well from a gameplay standpoint, but from a narrative one as well.
