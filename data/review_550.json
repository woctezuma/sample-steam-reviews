Good old times.\nMy very first purchased game. It's fun , FUN To play. For a game based on the DEAD ,the Community, the Workshop ,the game itself ARE'NT DYING. Played this game originally a year later after it's release, and its almost a decade, people still play it. I came to a conclusion that I never abandon this game, just do pauses, and take breaks from playing it. and its 2019 already dammit! Going to the feature part.\n\n+) Like I said. The game about dead , which is 10 years ALIVE !\n+) Game Modes, Campaign, Survival, Scavenge, Versus, Realism both Campaign and Versus. \n+) Guns. Lots of em. and the gun play just feels good.\n+) The infected. Come in two groups. Common (the simple hordes of the grey decaying humans) and Special (lucky losers mutated further into abominable new half-human species) \n+) The AI Director (it's also in my (-) section. see below) makes random spawns of everything, guns, healing items, infected which makes the game replayable over and over and over and over, and over...and over? and over! again!\n+) Steam Workshop. It also supports the replayability of the game thanks to its contributors (Bless em'\u2665) and with some few mods and tuning you can replace the default vanilla game and add new colors to your playing experience.\n+)Gameplay is dynamic, aggressive, and you're always on the move. The key feature of the zombies (called in its lore as Infected) ...they are, fast. unlike their slow and rather dumb counterparts.. they run, climb,jump, break through, do whatever it takes to reach to you! \n\nBut it also has some downs too. \n\n-) The Survivors differ only by their appearance, none of them have their special traits, bonuses penalties. Just by their looks.\n-) Ai director. Mostly, spawns of the infected. The higher the difficulty the closer the infected spawn. Sometimes they may spawn just a few feet away ,not in your field of view but almost behind you. And even RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU (this only occurs in two spots : safehouses of the chapters Stadium (Dark Carnival) and Airport (Dead Air))\n-) These 2 Chapters partcularly again. On higher levels they can be very frustrating (especiallu if you're a pistol player like myself) due to its spawing specifics. Hordes just spawn constantly and run towards you, they can even spawn in RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU (if you managed to reach for the safehouse first, you'll see it yourself), and there is no time delay between the hordes. They just simultaneously charge at you. Those two scenarios are really at odds with survivor players.\n-) (Versus Only) Special Infected are limited in ranged attacks to parry against the Survivors. Only 3 of them (Spitter, Tank Smoker) can do at least something from a distance. Well surely it encourages you for teamwork but basically it feels like ''bringing a knife to a gunfight).\n\nSo far I came up with this much. I intend to re play it again soon enough. like I said. ''Left 4 Dead 2'' is an immortal game. \n100 % recommend and must have for any Steam user,and zombie-horror genre lover. Too bad we cant know for sure are they gonna have any sequels in the future, but this one always is ''\u2665'' here for me. Long LIVE Left 4 DEAD 2.\n\nThat's all.

I remember playing this back in the day, alongside Left 4 Dead 1 with my school mates. \n\nBeing the sequel to the first game, Left 4 Dead 2 introduced new special zombies such as the Charger and Spitter. At the same time, there are also unique zombies that can appear, depending on the map. For example, there are zombies wearing hazmat suits, making them invulnerable to fire. Melee weapons and weapon upgrades were also added, giving players more options when it comes to fighting the zombie hordes.\n\nGameplay wise, the Left 4 Dead series basically defined a game type. You can hear people going \"It's like Left 4 Dead\" or \"Similar to Left 4 Dead\" when they try to find a way to describe gameplay in other games. Players will find themselves starting out with basic weaponry and as they make their way through the map, they'll eventually find more weapons available to them which come in handy at certain points of the map when you have to defend yourselves while waiting for an obstacle to clear or your transport vehicle to arrive at the end of the map.\n\nThe campaigns are designed to emulate \"movies\" in a way, with an AI called \"The Director\" dictating the ebb and flow of the campaign dynamically depending on the players' actions. This way, no two playthroughs will end up the same way but once you've played the game enough, you might be able to predict what's going to happen next. \n\nSure, the game might be quite old by now but it's still a classic co-op game to hop into with friends from time to time when you just want to mow down some zombie hordes. If you don't have any friends available to play with you, you can also play the game in singleplayer mode with AI teammates who are pretty good as well.\n\nWith Workshop support, you can customise the game to be your very own version of the zombie apocalypse.

The sequel added additional weapons, including a melee weapon system, more special infected, more survivors, more items, and more bells and whistles in general, and it has always felt like too much after the minimalist purity of its predecessor. Then, Valve added the original survivors and original campaigns to the sequel and made Left 4 Dead all but redundant.

This game is designed to be played with friends. Since my friends do not play it, and I do not make friends easily, I found playing with strangers to be boring and the game was more difficult than it should be.\n2. The game really sends a lot of tough enemies at you. Survival is not easy but getting outnumbered and overwhelmed is.\n3. The graphics are not great. Although this game was released in 2009, Valve had quite a lot of money by then. I feel that sticking with the Source game engine for such a long time was a poor decision.\n4. As a fan of first-person shooter games, I did not enjoy using the weapons in Left For Dead 2. The animations are not great, again referring to the game engine, nor are the sounds. I also felt they were too weak to deal with the zombies and there was no point to ammo conservation as I would always be out of ammo.\n5. I do not like how quickly the zombies move. For a game that is all about killing countless zombies in the endless hordes, killing them is not so easy to do but getting surrounded and killed is very easy. \n\n*Normally my reviews contain five topics with all of them being either positive or negative to provide consistency through the entirety of the review. However, Left For Dead 2 is a unique game for me as it has well over one hundred thousand positive reviews, yet I have a negative opinion of the game that goes beyond my own inability to enjoy the game but also includes my negative opinion of the final stand-alone product. In order to alleviate the amount of hateful comments this review will receive from both casual and fanatical players, without leaving the \"Allow Comments\" checkbox unchecked which prevents fair discussion of this review, I provide a BONUS topic that is positive to align with the plethora of players who did enjoy this game and continue to enjoy it.\n\nBONUS: The dialogue in Left For Dead 2 is incredible. The characters are decent and have their stereotypes combined with uniqueness to provide believable characters, but it is their dialogue that makes the game so much more enjoyable and memorable. As you battle against endless hordes of zombies, the dialogue brings the game to life completely and makes every round a fun and unique experience. You will truly enjoy your favorite character just by listening to their random dialogue.

It's worth buying. Yes, even after almost 7 years after the release people still play it even despite the fact it didn't really receive any new content. Why? Well, let me explain.\n\nIs it good because of graphics? Totally not. Even for early 2010's graphics weren't anything that impressive. It's still almost the same Source engine which powered Half-Life 2 and episodes. Yes, it was constantly updated but it didn't really progress. I mean we still have the same concept from early 90's: a game server hosts a map and up to 16 or 32 (or even 64 in some modifications) players can join and move around the map. You can reach certain points of the map and it will load another map. And that's all about it. But it's not open-world in any sense. It's something that reminds me of Doom and Quake games. In fact Source was partially based on Quake engine after all.\n\nBut don't think graphics are bad. No, they are pretty enjoyable. I just don't recall technological advancement being a major selling point for this game. The game can impress you sometimes. Some textures look really dated. But overall it's just there. The game graphics won't make you scream in excitement, nor it will disappoint you even in 2016. A lot of stuff is destructible. I saw hours spent on zombie animations: infected puke, beat eachother, walk around, die spectacularly if killed. It's nice to see actual damage done to their zombies' bodies: some severe dismemberment and burning. But some may say graphics are kinda old. (Please don't think I'm one of these guys who only cares about polygons and realism, I'm just getting started.)\n\nSo maybe the story is the main element here? Nope, you can complete the entire game without even learning anything about the characters or what's actually going on. You and 3 other people are given a selection of weaponry, medical supplies, some other stuff. You have a very simple goal: get to your destination or do something. Just get out of there alive.\n\nSo why anything from 10 to 20 thousand people are playing this game right now? Why so many people played it for two or three thousand hours? Because of gameplay.\n\nWords cannot describe how many different situations there are. There are only 10 or so types of enemies, 3 basic types of main weapons, a few different secondary weapons, grenades and other items. And that's it. I know it may sound a lot at first but very quickly you acquire a taste for a favorite combination of weapons and items.\n\nLeft 4 Dead series somehow manage to make people spend thousands of hours of their time playing the same set of maps. And it's a corridor shooter which means there is only one way to achieve your destination. How it's done then? Well, every time different items get generated in different places, you get zombies from different spawn points. You can play the same maps over and over, again and again. And people actually do.\n\nSpeaking of people, it's a multiplayer. Yes, there is single-player mode where you can complete campaign with bots. But the most fun is playing with people. I find PvE aspect extremely interesting. Keep in mind your enjoyment really depends on people you play with. This game is about cooperation, you will never be able to complete it alone. So you have to find a server with good players, maybe you should play with friends, maybe you should make friends with people who play properly. Playing with bunch of griefers will suck. Playing with someone who actually wants to play is the best thing since sliced bread. Holy crap, you have to help eachother. Someone shares a medkit with you. His medkit. A medkit is being spent to restore your health you wasted because you made bunch of mistakes. But someone helps you for some reason. And you help them back, sharing resources with them. Oh, and keep in mind there is no reward system for helping others.\n\nThere is PvP where you play as a bunch of zombies against a team of survivors controlled by other players. But I don't think it's as good as regular campaign. If someone thinks you are bad for the team, they just kick you out. Call me a weirdo, but I play it because of sense of fellowship or at least some basic positive human interaction. I don't really like the idea that someone may feel bad because I outsmarted them.\n\nI think I finally cracked Valve's logic. The main thing about a videogame is gameplay. This is exactly why we have these debates \u201c%gamename% isn't a real videogame!!11\u201d and other stuff. It's gameplay first. Yes, you need amazing visuals to make a masterpiece but it isn't the main thing you should focus on. I heard about Crysis as a game with great graphics many years ago, finally I decided to give it a try. I was utterly bored after a couple of hours\u00a0\u2014\u00a0its gameplay was dull. Yes, you need story and great sound effects. But they still are only an excuse for gameplay.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 doesn't fail to illustrate this concept. You can play it right away, you don't have to read wiki for 2 hours to craft a pickaxe or to build a basic rocket to orbit Kerbin. It takes minutes to learn basic concepts. \u201cEasy to learn, difficult to master\u201d\u00a0\u2014 yes, we have it. But after a couple of hours I began to care about the story. You play as one of 4 characters, who are they? Turns out they are almost real people with some depth to them. Not too much, just enough to understand how they feel about each other. The whole story of zombie virus is told through surroundings. You see countless writings on the walls, a lot of documents are scattered around. The story told not using some boring and forced cutscenes but using details. You may skip story elements if you don't care about it. Or you may spend hours reading L4D wiki like I did.\n\nValve remembers that this is a game. If you look through L4D concept art, you will see that survivors were supposed to look a lot more different. They wore a lot more utilitarian gear. In the final game they are wearing casual clothing which helps to establish who they were before the outbreak. I mean look at Rochelle's ear rings. I know what zombies would tear away first. It's unrealistic, and is it bad? Nope, it's fine, it's a videogame, not a reflection of reality.\n\nThere is a lot of stuff in Left 4 Dead series which have never been done before. Developers added commentaries in game how they ended up creating everything, it's really interesting to check out. And I think I finally understand Valve's logic: they create games with some new elements. They create a game, it succeeds. Then they make a sequel which feels much better, they implement everything they need to make a great videogame experience. This is exactly what happened to Portal and Portal 2, Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2. This is exactly why Half-Life\u00a03 may never happen: what exactly new can you say about first person shooter genre? It was told so many times, it's really hard to come up with something new. And this is exactly why they keep working on Left 4 Dead 3. At least it seems they are working on it. After all Left 4 Dead 2 appears to be incomplete to me. I feel like you can add more stuff in this concept.\n\nBut right now it's totally worth spending money on Left 4 Dead 2. It's a very addictive game, and most importantly people are still playing it. If you get bored, there are tons of content in Steam Workshop you can b-a-s-t-a-r-d-ize the game with (if in you are in that kind of stuff).", "timestamp_created": 1455107425, "timestamp_updated": 1455271651, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 203, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927201509475708008", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38660352": {"recommendationid": "38660352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198299621362", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 30, "last_played": 1551538278}, "language": "english", "review": "we all need L4D3, please", "timestamp_created": 1514212853, "timestamp_updated": 1514212853, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 282, "votes_funny": 33, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925753295421600342", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38870206": {"recommendationid": "38870206", "author": {"steamid": "76561197982835139", "num_games_owned": 165, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 4107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515912106}, "language": "english", "review": "It's 2018 and it's still a good game.", "timestamp_created": 1514657428, "timestamp_updated": 1514657428, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 124, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.887235045433044434", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30825700": {"recommendationid": "30825700", "author": {"steamid": "76561198104659379", "num_games_owned": 409, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 14613, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549236077}, "language": "english", "review": "Valve ignored this game because it doesn't rake in the money like tf2/dota/csgo and thats why its good", "timestamp_created": 1490844438, "timestamp_updated": 1490844439, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 200, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911961376667022705", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39415392": {"recommendationid": "39415392", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965633802", "num_games_owned": 139, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 955, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517341519}, "language": "english", "review": "we need L4D3!", "timestamp_created": 1516202639, "timestamp_updated": 1516202639, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 277, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927219271659851074", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48142370": {"recommendationid": "48142370", "author": {"steamid": "76561198155596263", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 82889, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 630, "last_played": 1551367011}, "language": "english", "review": "I still waiting for L4D3", "timestamp_created": 1546767007, "timestamp_updated": 1546767007, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 166, "votes_funny": 95, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911528289318084717", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26941669": {"recommendationid": "26941669", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143797441", "num_games_owned": 473, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 43333, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547804950}, "language": "english", "review": "Left 4 Dead 2 is my very first game on Steam.

Join a gang of four and thread thru several maps littered with many types of zombies. You'll run, shoot, run again, revive a team member that is in trouble, and run again. \n\n[h1] Pros:\t[/h1] \n\n- This game succeeds in creating the horror setting, and the music its accompanies you while you travel, giving at times hints of when its about to get serious.\n- Many types of gun and zombies. And you must choose your weapon to fit your style,from submachine guns, to assault rifles or if you need more kick a grenade launcher for full effect. Get your hands on an axe and plow away or pump that shotgun and kill the horde in a few shots.\n- While you can play alone, its much better playing with someone, has you can never guess the way the game is going.\n- The storyline takes you thru a number of settings spread over 6 campaigns, but with more available for downloading, expanding the lifetime of this game, and they tell a above average story, where the main goal is ESCAPE.\n- The multiplayer aspect of it is great, plenty of servers and players, and you can even play for the other side - The Zombies, and make use of the special powers of each one to kill your prey.\n- Imagine a huge hulking monsters appearing and you are inside an hotel complex, not much space to run, so you'll have to fight and survive to the next stage.\n- One of the strongest points in this game, is that at points, you can hear an audio cue, and you know you are going to get a overwhelming impact from the coming Horde, where you will have to fight tooth and nail for your life  \n\n[h1] Cons:\t[/h1]\n\n- You can play alone, but the bots wont be much of help!\n- Even on Hard, with the right players you wont have much trouble getting thru.  \n\n[h1] Final Review\t[/h1] \n\nJoin your friends or complete strangers in this horror-action game, you wont regret it, kill hordes of zombies and monsters, or join them and stalk your prey. I give this game a 8 out 10 in my book. Its worth the money, and you'll have fun for hours.\n\nEnjoy Guys and Girls, and if this review helped you in any way please leave me a Thumbs up, i would appreciate it immensely.\n", "timestamp_created": 1541270761, "timestamp_updated": 1541270761, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 67, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863813281059265137", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47012517": {"recommendationid": "47012517", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052829302", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 105601, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2254, "last_played": 1551874665}, "language": "english", "review": "Timeless classic.

It's one of those essential games every PC gamer must have in their Steam library.

With a message to those people, being simple and direct; you will not be disappointed by how much this game lives up to.\n\nI would advice the newcomers to this game to take it slowly and definitely look out for the -75% off sales or even better, the free offer of this game which is most frequently appearing on big Steam sales.

Once I got a PC that could run Left 4 Dead 2, I discovered that Left 4 Dead really has no end of enjoyment. It is not for everyone of course, but if you like slaying zombies, exploration, teamwork, fun with friends, and some hilarious moments, this game is excellent.\n\nIt is now 2016, and still, people are making mods, addons, skins, new game modes, and creating unique servers that change the rules of the game. It is hard to get bored with a game that people keep adding to this much.\n\nYou will unfortunately hear about, or experience yourself, bad players on this game. This goes for EVERY game out there on the Internet. If there is a way to ruin other players' fun, there are people who will try to do it. Please don't blame the game for bad players. Left 4 Dead 2 still has hundreds, maybe thousands of players who love to have a good time and try to support eachother in game. I'm one of those. =D If you have a bad experience, try again please. More good-natured players are always welcome.\n\nTo me, this is the best game in the world right now. This is because it provides a fun way to meet cool and amazing people, who enjoy this great game where you are rewarded for working TOGETHER, instead of just killing eachother. The game itself provides lots of fun, but what really makes it amazing are the people you play with, and people who continue to make the game better.\n\nI have put off writing a review to this game for so long, because I really can't say enough about it. This review seems like it barely scratches the surface to me. All I can say is try it. TRY IT. Join some games, download some add ons and try those. Remember not to take it too seriously.

The graphics are still great even when compared with today's standard. The hardware requirement is pretty low, any PC that aren't too ancient will be able to run this game pretty well, even for laptops that runs on integrated graphics.\n\nThe controls are smooth, bugs are almost non-existent. Official contents already have a lot of replayability, and on top of that the modding community is very active, adding tons of contents with mods for new maps, new game modes, and many funny cosmetic changes.\n\n[h1]Fast paced action game[/h1]\n\nAlthough the setting is in a zombie-apocalypse world, the game isn't like a horror survival game. This game is more like a fast-paced first-person shooter focusing on getting from point A to point B, mass-killing zombies and completing objectives. The graphics are very violent and gruesome, and there may be some jump scares when you first encounter some of those special zombies. However after playing for some time, you will get used to the violent graphics, and learn to pick up sound cues to be prepared for the jump scare. This game is a pretty good game for gamers who wanted to enjoy the zombie-apocalypse subgenre but too afraid to play other horror-focused survival games.\n\n[h1]Co-op gameplay and community[/h1]\n\nThis game heavily emphasizes on co-op gameplay, and so it is best played with friends with voice chat on. Although you can still play it in single player (where the rest of the team will be controlled by AI), the AI is almost as good as a novice player in terms of action judgement and reaction time. You will need better real players in order to win harder difficulties.\n\nEven in versus mode, the game also encourages co-op gameplay, where the team with better teamwork and co-ordination will win the round.\n\nThe game community is mixed. When you're lucky, you get a great team and enjoy the game very much. But sometimes you get trolls that joins in and then kills your whole team to ruin the game. That's why it is best played with friends, or make friends with people you enjoyed playing together with in those great public games.\n\n[h1]For achievement hunter[/h1]\n\nThis game have a healthy balance of different types of achievements. You get some just by playing the game normally. Some of them require some skills, some of them requires some luck, and some of them requires you to setup the game scenario together with your team.\n\nAlthough the game community isn't dead yet, it isn't as active anymore. Some of online-achievements requires a lot of luck when finding for public servers to play on, especially multiplayer achievements that involve a specific game mode or map. These are easier done with boosting.\n\nAlso, there are a few very difficult ones that you will need to have a team of dedicated players working together to win (eg: Complete a stage in expert realism mode).\n\nSo if you are a completionist who wants to 100% this game, it will take quite a while and quite a lot of effort.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nMy score: 9.5/10 (Get it with your friends, and play together!)", "timestamp_created": 1527670231, "timestamp_updated": 1527670231, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 106, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879510819911956787", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27956786": {"recommendationid": "27956786", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040248266", "num_games_owned": 423, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 100351, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547937032}, "language": "english", "review": "Even though this game has a highly toxic community it still remains one of my favorite games of all times.

But in many ways the most important different between the two games is the scoring system.\n\nWithout mods, the first games scoring system really did tend to induce rage. A single mistake on a map and you could lose so many points that teams would be totally demoralized and either fall apart (making the game effectively over) or just quit (making it absolutely over). For hardcore players this was half the fun, but for the average casual player it could make Left 4 Dead a little too frustrating.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2 on the other hand had a far more forgiving score system allowing teams who fail badly on map 1 to still feel they have a good chance of clawing the in back in the next 3 or 4 maps. With party wipes being a little less likely due to the removal of the quad cap, Left 4 Dead 2 is still a game people can play causally and still enjoy. With the extra variety of a lot more special infected meaning a lot more variety in possible tactics, Left 4 Dead 2 is still one of the best team focused games that I have ever played.\n\nIf you have a small group of close friends who love winning through superior team work rather than superior twitch skills, Left 4 Dead 2 is one of the best PvP games you could try. But be warned, playing with random people you have never met can be rewarding, but more often than not it can be bloody annoying.\n\nHOURS ON RECORD : I don't play this game on my public account.

However, single player is difficult due to less-than-stellar AI, multiplayer even more so due to its less-than-stellar community. Your best bet is to find or bring three friends, and I'm sure you'll have a blast.\n\nIf you decide to fly solo and confront the community on your own, please complete the maps in single player, with friends, or on easy campaign online and learn their layouts before proceeding to Versus or higher difficulties. This will result in lower rates of vote kicking. But you will probably still be vote-kicked. Don't take it too personally.\n\nDon't forget to check out the Workshop. Whether you like serious and well-crafted maps, or turning your game into an anime rendition of Ghostbusters, your experience will be 100% more enjoyable.\n\nThat's it.

This can really ruin your game experience especially for unexperienced players as you will be kicked for almost any reason, half the time for no good reason at all. Examples could be:\n- Missed the insta kill spot in versus? kicked! \n- Shot a teamate by accident because he ran infront of you? kicked!\n- haven't already played over 500 hours of the game? kicked!\n- your team leave you to die for no good reason? kicked!\n- can't speak russian? kicked!\n- use a health kit to save yourself on 3 health and not help your team mate who is on 43 health? kicked!\n- get slowed down by common infected when the team rushes? kicked!\n- do really well against the other team? the entire other team leaves, closing the server\n- take the melee weapon that a 9 year old on your team wanted? kicked!\n- the vote kick on you doesnt get accepted by the rest of the team? vote kicker leaves the game\nthis list could go on and on... oh and there is the guy that joins, kills the team, throws himself out of the window and then leaves i mean just **** those guys\n(would just like to mention these are the examples that have all happened to me in the past two weeks of playing)\n\nDespite this however the community does have some nice people in it, who just want to play the game and dont mind helping people or losing unfortunately these people arent extremely common so alot of the time your stuck with a toxic team that will kick you for just about any reason if your not perfect.\n\nOther than the toxic players however, the game really doesn't have much i can fault it on\n- There are 11 campaigns that are ready available without mods and campaigns aren't too long and remain pretty interesting throughout \n- a Fairly wide range of weapons with 14 guns, 11 melee weapons\n- There are eight characters, four for each left for dead \"game\" each of them as interesting, funny and well developed as the next \n- there are 9 different types of infected (including special common infected under just common infected) with 7 of them playable in the verses gamemode\n- the A.I director helps keep each level a little bit different, making replyability enjoyable\n- bringing along friends is a great idea as it supports 4 player co-op and 4v4 player matches (there are servers that raise this cap, immensely)\n- there are 70 available achievements that you can get so achievement hunting is a vaible playstyle\n\nThe modding community for this game is absolutely amazing with mods for just about anything with different weapons, and character skis, HD textures and lighting, new campaigns and gamemodes, different infected skins and sounds there is  a mod for the amount of cockroches that spawn on the ground (i have this, its called Roach Rules) i would list more mods but that list would take to long to type. There is also a lot of anime mods and bikini mods for the character zoey so if your into that, you'll like the modding community even more\n\nOverall, despite the bad sportsmanship of some players, it really is an enjoyable game, with lots of replayability and things you can do to the game to make it diffferent, bringing along friends can make the game even better and if you dont have any (i know the feeling) chances are you can find some when you play.\n\nOverall i'd give the game a 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1465333757, "timestamp_updated": 1523761079, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 134, "votes_funny": 53, "weighted_vote_score": "0.905157625675201416", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40968864": {"recommendationid": "40968864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123595466", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 84369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 19, "last_played": 1551243510}, "language": "english", "review": "A review to answer your questions\n\nIs this game dead?\nHell no it isn't, there is still players playing it to this day 2018\n\nIs it fun?\nHell yes it is, one of the best coop zombies games in videogame history.\n\nWhat audience is this game designed for?\nFor all audiences: to professionals to novices\n\nWhat is this game about?\n4 survivors vs a endless horde of zombies, with the objective to work together to survive to the end.\n\nWhat mode would you recommend?\nFor new players normal campaigns would be highly recommended, just click on quickplay and learn through experience\n\nThere is mods in this game?\nHell yes, this game has been out so long that many people created a long list of options you can choose to upgrade in the workshop.\n\nIs 20$ worth it?\nHell yes, worth your money and this would take a long time before you get bored.

This sequel greatly improves upon the already popular original despite only being released a year later than it. There are many modes available, from single player to co-op to versus to survival; there are even a lot of \"Mutations\", modes that have unique rules and restrictions. The characters are also pretty funny and each have a primary trait, such as Nick being a serious pessimist and Ellis being a naive optimist. Playing on a controller or keyboard shouldn't matter either way as the aiming and controls are smooth- possibly even better than some of today's releases. What makes things even better is that there are a ton of mods on its Steam Workshop, so you can turn the survivors into other pop culture characters, make the Infected bizarre creatures, or give your weapons pretty colors. The main concern is that the AI can sometimes suck, especially on single player mode.

Do you like guns? Do you like Mariocart? Do you like to spam right-click like your middle finger has Parkinsons? Well you are going to love this!\n\nL4D2 is a unique, fast paced twitch shooter with loads of replayability. Even if you get bored of the official valve content there are tons of fun community maps to try out. In particular I recommend Questionable Ethics and The Bloody Moors. Despite the zombie theme L4D2 is not really a horror game and the L4D2 campaign and characters in particular are pretty cartoonish compared to the darker design of the original Left 4 Dead. However, all of the L4D1 maps were ported over to L4D2 a long time ago now, so there isn't much need to buy the original unless you are really curious or nostalgic about it.\n\nThe game is getting a bit old now with alot less people online than there used to be. Consequently mosty of the players you find online are either veterans/long term addicts of the game or newbies from the previous sale. This only really applies to the PvP modes of the game (Versus and Scavenge) but new players are going to have a tough time in public games because of this. L4D2 does not have a very high skill ceiling like Counter Strike or Quake but there is still a fairly steep learning curve to start with. In any random public game you are likely to be playing with players who have 1000+ hours who know the maps like the back of their hand and know all the various little tricks and strats. You will find them frustrating to play against and they will find it frustrating having you on their team. This is the kind of game where one player can really drag a whole team down so if you are that player you can expect to be kicked alot. If you are new you should start out playing versus with friends, or get onto some 10v10 commuinity servers where you can mess around without getting kicked from the game.\n\nPeople say that the public versus community is really terrible but I dont think it is any worse than other PvP games apart from the fact that some of the game mechanics specific to L4D2 make people rage such as the forced dependence on teammates and some of the inherent randomness of the game. In fact I would say that the versus community is better now that it was 4 years ago when the game was more popular. For example most of the time now people will 'ready up' before starting a round, whereas before it was normal to see people deliberately rushing out of spawn while players are still loading in. But yeah... if you are new you are going to need thick skin in public versus.\n\nVersus is definately the most replayable mode, and the reason why many people keep playing this game for thousands of hours, but it what I said above puts you off you can always stick to playing the co-operative modes which are slower paced and with more easygoing players. The exception to this is expert difficulty, where friendly fire damage is signifigant and effects playstyle alot. Because of friendly fire expert is also the biggest target for griefers. Playing alot of expert co-op will make you paranoid about teamkillers and you will start to accumulate a nice big blocklist.\n\nAnyway what I have written might come across as negative but I think it is honest view based on over 2000 hours of gameplay which by itself says alot about addictive and replayable this game is. I don't think I have ever played any other game for as many hours, and no other game has made me laugh or rage as much as L4D2.", "timestamp_created": 1424228104, "timestamp_updated": 1424228104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 47, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811918079853057861", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32635954": {"recommendationid": "32635954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014781962", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 37, "playtime_forever": 34574, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1531082583}, "language": "english", "review": "Best zombie game ever there's really not much to it", "timestamp_created": 1498114879, "timestamp_updated": 1498114879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 549, "votes_funny": 75, "weighted_vote_score": "0.90331953763961792", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45686833": {"recommendationid": "45686833", "author": {"steamid": "76561198454136947", "num_games_owned": 54, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4564, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548954266}, "language": "english", "review": "Left 4 Dead 3 when ?", "timestamp_created": 1541608103, "timestamp_updated": 1541608103, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 88, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853333830833435059", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26273273": {"recommendationid": "26273273", "author": {"steamid": "76561198004175437", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 490658, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542430876}, "language": "english", "review": "Would recommend it to anyone looking to play a zombie game.\n\nIt is one of the best surviving zombie co-op games available on steam.\n\nAlso comes with a large pool of mods under the steam community workshop to make it even more interesting.", "timestamp_created": 1477680481, "timestamp_updated": 1477680917, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853647828102111816", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17642720": {"recommendationid": "17642720", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032363047", "num_games_owned": 515, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 188479, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543536610}, "language": "english", "review": "Ruined my gaming life and at the same time it really enhanced it.

Yeah, I don't really like Versus and Campaign, which are the most played game modes. Being a Scavenge player, where the community is way smaller, I get to know basically everyone who plays it regularly and when I join a game (mostly on the Rooftop map) it's guaranteed that I will meet someone there who is either on my friends list or that I knew before just by playing. I'd say the best years to play this game mode where 2010-2013, it just died from there on to nowadays, but surprisingly, there's people who still play Scavenge, so there's always at least 1 game.\n\nLeft 4 Dead 2's main problem, unlike most FPS games, isn't hackers. It's the community itself, specially the tryhards. Those morons that take video gaming more seriously than real life (well, they probably don't have a proper life to begin with anyway). Yeah, they get mad in [i]public[/i] matches if people don't have over 2.000 hours and don't skeet every Hunter they see, even if their team is winning. You're going to have a hard time playing the PvP gamemodes, Scavenge and Versus, if you don't have at least 200 or 300 hours on Campaign and Survival you're going to be judged (if your profile isn't set to private or friends-only).\n\nDon't expect a horror shooting game, there's no horror elements in Left 4 Dead 2.

Unfortunately, apart from the adventurous stories that are hillariously narrated by Ellis, there is nothing else worth mentioning about the whole group, as the Survivors are overly restrained by their repetitive voice commands. Unlike [i]Left 4 Dead[/i] which manages to balance this flaw by additionally realeasing an online [url=http://www.l4d.com/comic/]comic[/url] with intriguing new info about its characters, [i]Left 4 Dead 2[/i] fails to attract the audience's attention towards the new Survivors.

And what makes this game a one of a kind? Besides there are several titles in the same genre with similar elements. Let me first point out the 'good' in the game. Valve indeed outdid themselves with a variety of special infected each with unique ability and style. The common infected rush in hordes and are super fast on feet. It's thrilling!\n\nAll maps, single or multiplayer are campaign styled which means they are huge and you navigate across them. Like an added bonus, nothing is as exciting as a speed run and dodge through hordes of infected. What's more fascinating is the community mods and servers that offer custom gameplay experiences. The first person shooter is simple to grasp with absence of any hud clutter. Player interaction with health and healing makes it a fabulous team work experience and sometimes demanding as in the realism mode.\n\nNow let me point out the 'bad'. It's valve engine and thus is never bug free no matter how many patches they release. While a good teamwork makes the gameplay exciting, some community servers offer cancerous and salty players that just restort to team killing and notoriety. Reputed servers are known for weeding out such players and keep a balanced gameplay.\n\nNevertheless, the first thing you do is jump straight into one of many community servers for coop campaign and play wisely. You wanna avoid accidental team killing and straying far away from the team while providing support as much as possible. Sure, you may also wanna start farming for points whilst your mates are left for dead and still complete the campaign like a pro. You either die a hero or live long enough to be the villain!\n\nRated 8.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1491472615, "timestamp_updated": 1491499431, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.811862289905548096", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28761632": {"recommendationid": "28761632", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065403633", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 5827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549597165}, "language": "english", "review": "A WORD OF WARNING: BEING THAT THIS IS A VALVE GAME, EXPECT THE COMMUNITY TO BE WORSE THAN A MALIGNANT TUMOR.

Each campaign has 4 survivors, who have to reach the safety vehicle or area on the other side and have to fight their way through tons of infected. There's also versus and a lot of other game modes.\n\nPROS: \n+ Teamplay can make a real difference. Good communication and teamwork seem to be more important than skill\n+ Good replay value: the director spawns infected, objects, weapons and items randomly each time, making playing the same maps over and over less repetitive\n+ A balanced amount of weapons that satisfy in both audio and visuals\n+ A good variety of game modes, difficulties and alternate playstyles that can deliver a challenge or a different type of experience. Has expert realism gotten too easy? There's a bunch of mutations that step up the difficulty by a whole \n+ This is a game that's very user-friendly in supporting the use and management of add-ons in a simple and clear-cut way instead of having to learn about managing files, extensions and whatnot. You can download, use and delete mods all without leaving the game and you rarely have to open any files on your desktop\n+ The Source engine and console make adjusting the settings to your likings easier and is a comfortable engine to play with\n+ Trading cards\n\nCONS \n- L4D(2) is infamous for its toxic community, especially in VS and the forums. This is mainly because of how suitable this game is for trolls (friendly fire, suicides, etc.). Joining or starting public games has a fairly present chance of inexperienced, arrogant or annoying players, psychos, grievers or trolls joining and ruining the game. A lot of people are playing on difficulties that they cannot handle, sometimes solely for the sake of causing unrest. To gauge an idea of what this is like: our former server's banlist had accumulated over 350 banned players in under a year and after 2000 hours of L4D2, I had over 400 people blocked on Steam due L4D2\n- The maps can get repetitive after a while, despite the director randomizing entities \n- (Rare) crashes, glitches and disruptions in both sound and visual. This is partially related to add-on collision\n- a more recent con, the official servers are constantly struggling to stay active, it seems\n\nIf you plan on playing L4D2, I highly recommend you friend some nice players, play with friends or play on a moderated server (admins that kick troublemakers), because at some hours, playing this game on the highest difficulty is near impossible due to the type of players mentioned above. \nNevertheless, L4D2 is a great game that can be tons of fun and you'll likely keep coming back at it for many hours.

And I'm not refering to just the L4D2 cast, the L4D1 cast is also great! It's quite entertaining to hear how these people interact with eachother in this kind of setting, especially when the two casts meet up in [i]The Passing[/i]. Of course, the zombies do get their attention given they [i]are[/i] what you'll be shooting/hitting/tearing to shreds.\n\nGameplay wise, there's plenty of replay value with various gamemodes, campaigns from both L4D1 and L4D2, mutations which can greatly change how the game is played, and different things that might occur within said campaigns. RNG plays a big factor here, as it determines what guns you might end up with, what special zombie types you'll encounter, the items you'll find, and various other things. Maybe you'll get lucky and find two medkits halfway through the map instead of one bottle of pills. Or maybe you'll get [i]unlucky[/i] and get sniper rifles with a Tank up ahead, ready to cause havoc. Regardless of that, this game is still pretty darn fun to play, especially if you bring friends along.\n\nAs for presentation, I'm surprised how well a game from [b][i]2009[/i][/b] not only still looks good, but sounds good as well. There's maaaany hidden details you'll likely glance over when playing through the game, such as the various writings on the safehouses you enter, providing story for some of the folks that live within that area. Or perhaps the fact there's a couple minigames you can find in [i]Dark Carnival[/i], some of which tie into achievements. Or maybe even [spoiler]Bill's corpse still remaining in the very spot he died at in [i]The Sacrifice[/i] when visiting that area as the L4D2 survivors in [i]The Passing[/i][/spoiler].\n\nOf course there are some issues, but it's not really the game itself. If you're playing Left 4 Dead 2, play with friends. While you might find good and/or nice randoms, you'll more than likely find folks who'll kick you at the sight of making a single mistake, even on Versus. Speaking of online multiplayer, you won't find many people, if [i]at all[/i], playing Scavenge. Good luck getting those achievements. The AI, while it can autoaim, is pretty bad. Wouldn't recommending relying on one to keep you up in battle. Another issue I have is that due to L4D2 containing everything L4D1 had (and even a mutation that prevents L4D2 specials from spawning, making it just like L4D1), this makes L4D1 almost pointless to purchase other than to say you own it.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game to just about anyone, with the added note to play with friends and have a stable internet connection. And I haven't even mentioned the Steam Workshop, which can add [i]even more[/i] content in the game.

The left 4 dead games \"both of them\" are games that are unlike anything else I have ever played, they are games that quite literally changed my entire life. These games are the types of games that you can meet people on that will be friends for years to come and these games also have an unreal amount of replay value. you have campaign for the casual players with addon support so you have an almost endless amount of maps to play if you dont mind downloading more, you have versus which can be really fun, but sadly in both games unless you play with friends the community is either tryhards that care too much about winning or people that are so terrible that you wonder how they even got their computer running in the first place. Lastly there is survival, my personal favorite game mode. People in the survival community \"once you actually find the real survival players\" are useually a nice bunch of people and its a game mode unlike the other two in a good way once you give it a chance. Honestly both of these games although they both are titled \"Left 4 Dead\" are very different and many people i have run into tend to think of one game as simply better than the other, but objectively speaking this is simply not the case. Both games are too different to really make that kind of judgement. Both of these games are games that if you enjoy this type of gameplay, then you could waste thousands of hours on them.\n\nBut this brings up the biggest problem with these games, the people in them. Do enough searching and you will find people you can mingle with but the majority of public players in either game regardless of game mode are unbelieveably dumb. In vs also not just the really dumb people but you have the typical assholes found in any game based around pvp that seem to think that winning makes them more important somehow as a person and don't seem to realize that there is no reward for winning in a l4d games like there is in a competitive game like counter strike or dota with their tournaments. \n\nCampaign is a really casual game mode compared to the other two but still there tends to be assholes in this game mode too sometimes, people that find joy in joining pub games just to grief their teammates for some reason and then leave without a word. Thankfully this is rare and most people in campaign are either mute or friendly.\n\nThen there is survival, a game mode that brings me more enjoyment but also more frustration than any other mode. In L4D2 it seems to be a collection of people that for some stupid reason refuse to play anything except for the mall map, people that are actually really terrible at it too and can run laps for 100+ min on mall sure but could not get a gold on any other map to save their life. There is l4d1 survival as well which is a dif style of play but the community is dying off because all of the players who have been around a long time have gotten tired of the game and pubs are beyond stupid. Always either people trying to glitch a time or people so bad/dumb you wonder if they were dropped on their head as a baby 5 times.\n\nAll in all, You will enjoy the l4d games, both of them if you enjoy co-op based shooters, but you will have to endure a very mixed crowd of people regardless of game, with the first game haveing a somewhat more friendly crowd cause of the smaller community. I would recommend both games if you have the patience to search for people worth talking to or have someone to go into the game with.", "timestamp_created": 1418238906, "timestamp_updated": 1418238906, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 109, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838291585445404053", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47980003": {"recommendationid": "47980003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106681718", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 266, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545766237}, "language": "english", "review": "--- \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc04\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc18 ---\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Fine\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Meh\n\u2610 Playing on a mobile is more fun\n\n--- \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc0e\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc18 ---\n\u2610 The author must be a mastermind\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 It\u2018s a story, indeed\n\u2610 Uninteresting\n\u2610 None\n\n--- \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc07\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc12 ---\n\u2610 Reality looks like Minecraft\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Okay\n\u2610 Meh\n\u2610 Minecraft\n\n--- \ud835\udc00\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc03\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0e ---\n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Listenable\n\u2610 Ouch\n\u2610 My ears are bleeding\n\n--- \ud835\udc01\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc06\ud835\udc12 ---\n\u2611 Not a single one\n\u2610 Some\n\u2610 A bit too many\n\u2610 Almost unplayable\n\u2610 Unplayable\n\n--- \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc02\ud835\udc14\ud835\udc0b\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc18 ---\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\u2610 Hard\n\u2611 Normal\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 An embryo could play it\n\n--- \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc11\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc03 ---\n\u2610 Grind only\n\u2610 A lot\n\u2610 Some\n\u2610 Almost none\n\u2611 None\n\n--- \ud835\udc06\ud835\udc00\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc04 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc08\ud835\udc0c\ud835\udc04 ---\n\u2611 over 100 hours\n\u2610 50 -
