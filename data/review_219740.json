Huge props to the art team and devs making it. Its one of the most asthetically pleasing thing I've seen. What isn't pleasing, is the first real-time hour when you start.\n\nSo you start. Boring cutscene aside, you are met in a seemingly natural enviorment. You start gathering twigs. You yawn. You continue collecting.  Your eyes flutter, like a butterfly...Snooooore. \n\nThat half-baked metaphor is about how the first second you spawn in, the gameplay is a drag to work through. Constantly collecting, grinding, and killing things isn't gameplay. Gameplay is being sucked into a completely strange world and being there, sucked in like a vacuum, and occasionaly leaving. Gameplay isn't \"Ok, go here. Grab that. Hit that a few times. rinse and repeat.\". Gameplay is always a 3-way-cycle of going somewhere, grabbing something, and killing something in this game.\n\nAnd your next nemesis, alongside rinse and repeat gameplay, is perma death. Sure, you can save after each day, but thats for leaving, not exactly much else. Wait.... Unability to save you game to make sure you can live, and permadeath...\n\n[b]Those don't go together...[/b]\n\nSo your constantly in a state of either \"Well, I go here and die or go here and die.\" or \"Time to start over!\" You are always unable to do anything but that three-way-cycle and decking yourself in armor, but its always useless because when you encounter a new enemy, you don't know if its balanced and fair or just \"I sneezed SO hard you turned into dust!\". And its even MORE useless because it never matters because you can just make one wrong step and go down a pitfall of lack of resources, dying, and constant enemies that utterly destroy you and your base. Perma death and being unable to save is a HELL-MARCH for disaster. \n\nCombat is often a chore, too, either rapidly clicking/holding Mouse 1 on an enemy is totally engaging combat.

For the most part, the controls and interface are intuitive, so it's simply a matter of deciding where to go or what to do.\n\nThe game is called Don't Starve, and hunger is indeed a major theme. If you go a few days without food, you will die. That said, there are plenty of other things to kill you - a variety of animals and monsters, environmental hazards, and your own dwindling sanity. To battle this, you rely on building your own equipment, consumables and structures, ranging from weapons and armor to crock pots to unwholesome magical devices.\n\nDon't Starve can be brutal, so you should expect to die, but just making good progress is rewarding in itself. You unlock new characters as you play, each with little touches or specialties to diversify your experience. And while there are some pretty powerful or useful items you can make, there are still a lot of ways to play, and they're all valid (which is good, because sometimes you don't have much choice.)\n\nIf you're bored or frustrated, you can change your experience by starting a new game and adding or removing features. If you're tired of fighting certain monsters, you can just turn them off. I haven't messed with this myself, as I like the feeling of surprise, and playing the game as-is, but the developers have left the doors wide open for custom play experiences. In the same way, you can make use of a wealth of user-created elements.\n\nThere are a few things I missed for awhile, like the fact that you can view a map of everywhere you've been so far, but overall the game doesn't suffer much from lack of tutorial or hand-holding. You can go read everything on a wiki if you prefer, but this is a game where I don't actually begrudge trial and error learning. Encountering strange new things and deciding what to do with them is a ton of fun, even if it sometimes gets you killed.\n\nA warning (at least from my perspective) - this game is so immersive, I prefer to keep playing it for hours on end once I start. It's not a game I enjoy having to stop, unless I come to good stopping point like dying at the end of a long survival run. In fact, sometimes I forget to eat for a long time when I play this.

It does a good job. \n\n\n\nThe core gameplay is simply trying to survive. gathering materials and food during the day, and huddling by a fire, trying to craft useful tools at night. As the day to night cycle progresses, so does the seasonal cycle. After a couple days, winter comes, making it harder to collect food, and hunt. The nights become longer and the days become shorter as you huddle by your fire, trying not to freeze to death. During winter, your homemade farms stop becoming useful. Huntable animals disappear and other more dangerous animals come in swarms. \n\n\n\nAs far as the story goes, there is an oddly rich story, which can only be experienced by skilled players. Whenever a new game is started, Maxwell, the games antagonist, warns him to get food. The real story mode cannot be achieved unless the player has found the four pieces, and then moves to the next level. After beating a few levels, they reach the epilogue, where maxwell is unlocked as a playable character and the game is complete. \n\n\n\nDon't starve\u2019s graphics and art style is very Tim Burton. The monsters, alone have a scary but yet cute feel to them. The sound of the game is very creepy yet welcoming. depending on what the player is doing at the time. The music changes whenever the player is in combat or not, making the combat feel even more immersive. \n\n\n\nDon\u2019t stare also has a large amount of options. Not only can you pick your character but you can also modify the world and its many resources. Players can make the world a food rich wonderland, or a barren wasteland, randomized each time. Each playable character has its own stats, and buffs/debuffs, tailoring to each possible playstyle. \n\n\n\n\nThe in game crafting provides a large variety of machines, tools, farms and structures. The player can craft anything from carpets, campfires, spears, drying racks, walls, bee-based mines and a large variety of clothing, all with special perks. Winter coats to keep you warm, mining hats to provide light, feather hats to increase how many birds there are, armour to reduce damage, and a flower garland to keep sanity up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDon't starve does lots of things right. \n\n\nThe art style and sound design is amazing for this game\n\nThe crafting feels organic and worth the effort.\n\nThe clothes in the game change not only how the player looks, but also has bonuses. \n\nThe Monsters in the game are interesting and fun to hunt.\n\nThe many varieties of food make the game more interesting\n\nThe story is enjoyable, even if you don't play through it. \n\nThe antagonist is one of the best \u201cbad guys\u201d i've seen in games for a while\n\nThe different playable characters are fantastic \n\nThe game has a customizable world setting.\n\nThe game has playing cards\n\n\nDon't starve does a few thing wrong.\n\n\nThe cave mechanic is hardly explored until late game\n\nThe game has a few bugs still needing to be fixed\n\nThe follower mechanic should be touched up\n\nThe vanilla game can be a tad boring\n\nThe player may rage-quit after dieing on a long time world.\n\nThe game lacks achievements\n\nThe game lacks vanilla co-op\n\n\nDon\u2019t Starve isn't only a magnificent survival game, but it is also a well told story, for those who care to play it.

I died.\n\nDon't Starve is a creepy-cute survival game in which you're made to learn through mistakes, and in which the slightest mistake can kill you and erase all your progress. I'm currently 74 days into a run, but not without a little abuse of the game mechanics. Don't Stave is a hard rogue-like, in that the instant you die your entire world and all your progress is erased, but there are a couple resurrection items in each world that let you respawn once after death, and I've found that there's a few seconds between dying and resurrection in which you can safely quit the game without it saving over your file. Basically, it's the old Pokemon trick: if you accidentally kill the legendary, just reboot your save file and everything's fine.\n\nIs this cheating? Probably. Kind of. Not as much as the time I played through this game's entire adventure mode with God Mode turned on because I so badly wanted the character you unlock at the end. (I know, I'm THAT kind of player. In my defense, the adventure mode of this game is just absurd.)\n\nI've put more hours into this game than into all my other games combined, and I think that fact alone should show how fun it is. It's a sandbox game, in that there are no set objectives, but there are so many things to do in the game that forming your own objectives is easy and natural; it's pretty obvious when you run across something you haven't accomplished yet (surviving through winter; unlocking the Magic tab; collecting the parts to the Teleportato), and in order to accomplish it, you usually have to master some new aspect of the game. In my current save file, I have: survived two winters; walked around the entire overworld map; hunted down MacTusk; survived (and slain) the mighty Deerclops; and built a base with six farms, two bee boxes, and a nearby spider den, which I'm pretty sure could sustain me indefinitely without me having to move beyond my line of berry bushes. All this and I've still only scratched the surface. (Literally; there's a whole cave world below the surface world, and a ruin world below that, which I've only read about so far.)\n\nThe only downside to this game is the roguelike element, in that every time you die you have to start over. But the randomly-generated world makes starting over kind of fun, especially with the option to try new characters, and once you have the basic survival tools there's a million directions you can go in, most of which you won't have touched in previous playthroughs. \n\nI will say, however, that the dying does get annoying, especially when so many of your deaths feel like bullshit. Like those eyeball plants that attacked and killed me before I could figure out what they were. Or the wolves, which will NEVER stop chasing you, or even give you time to craft something to defend yourself. Or all those times a monster attacked my campsite at night, forcing me to run in circles around my fire as the light slowly burned out. Basically, if at any moment you aren't prepared for everything, it probably means you're about to die. The only reason I can ignore this is that I would quickly quit my game whenever I was about to die, but without cheats, the permadeath mechanic makes progress in this game infuriatingly difficult (but incredibly rewarding when it does happen).\n\nI'd give it an 8/10.

You're low on food and sanity so you start picking up these berries which you haven't thought about doing in the beginning, and you also found flowers. You try eating them but notice that whenever you pick'em up your sanity raises. that's good.\nAfter a while of looting the enviorment you come across a rock biome. Great, you've gathered enough rocks to make yourself nothing because the night came again.\nAfter almost dying at night you start getting stone and come across a gold nugget. What could that be?\nAnd, again, a bulb ontop of the symbol of Atom has caputred your eye.\nYou make a science machine as you start grapsing that basics of this game. After a while of exploring your general land you come across a pig village with, ofcourse, the king pig inside. These pigs will turn out to be your only allies in this game. They have farms, they offer protection for any kind of meat and will save you from some of the horrors of this game. So you start making your base next to them as it is the only logical choice you could make in this game.\nAfter more days of looting and gathering resources you hear a faint woof. What could that be?\nHounds.\nAs you run relentlessly without understanding what's going on, your fellow pigsman are there to save the day, not for long though. You came out clean this time, which you should thank the gods of this cursed land.\nYou started making up a base, you crafted random items from the science tab and again, a bulb has lit up.\nYou craft an alchemy engine which will help you craft more scientific items.\nAfter roaming around in the world yet again, you come across ancient guardians of this cursed land.\nThey work like clockwork, they defend their land like no other creatures. You bribe your fellow pigsman and you go to fight these ancient creatures, winning the battle.\nAfter looting their corpses, you come across gears. When arriving at your house, you craft an Ice Box to slow the spoilage of the food. Neat.\nYou have a base, well protected from the horros of this world, you have everything you'd like in it.\nNow, there are two scenarios which can happen:\n1. Summer starts.\nYou have no idea what to do, your character starts to heat up without any knowledge on what's happening.\nYour house starts burning and you, yourself, is overheating.\nOkay, lets say that didn't happen and you miraculously didn't any fires or didn't overheat because you mined ice.\nGuess what?\nDragonfly. I'll leave that for you to discover what's that.\nScenario 2:\nWinter starts.\nGreat, you're cold, you're almost dead but you came across a failed survivor which had a Puffy Vest, thermal stone and a Cat Cap. How lucky you are. So you barely survive this day and come back to your house, rapidly fueling your campfire as it's the only gateway from this hellish environment. You have food in your ice box, you have enough wood somehow to survive the winter (Who am I kidding, this never happends, but for the purpose of this story let's assume it does).\nA saxphone sound comes out of your characters body and a text appeares, \"That sounded big\".\nI'll let you guess what's going to happen next.\nOfcourse, there are 2 more seasons, Autumn and Spring, but I feel like they shouldn't be focused on now as they are pretty similliar.\nYou die.\nAgain.\nAnd again.\nAnd again.\nAnd again, until you master the horrors of this cursed land, feeling success after surviving your first winter, summer, autumn, spring. You survive the countless waves of hounds. Great.\nYou come across a sinkhole.\nI'll let you find out what's going to happen next.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll in all, this game is a well polished survival game with a giant replay value, very little bugs are found, great developers who listen to the community, great DLC's which add a LOT to the game which are very cheap aswell.\nIf you like survival games and want to feel what a real survival game is, check this game out, it's on sale right now aswell.\nThis game will always have a special place for me.", "timestamp_created": 1454758117, "timestamp_updated": 1456421104, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.785943388938903809", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14539177": {"recommendationid": "14539177", "author": {"steamid": "76561198020900337", "num_games_owned": 253, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 447, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438941155}, "language": "english", "review": "You will die.\n\nSpiders will murder you.\nHounds will murder you.\nBunnymen will murder you.\nTrees will murder you.\nTentacles will murder you.\nShadows will murder you.\nGiants will destroy you.\nBees will obliterate you.\nPenguins will pretty much annihilate you.\n\nAnd that's only if you don't starve first.", "timestamp_created": 1424320619, "timestamp_updated": 1529767541, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 592, "votes_funny": 966, "weighted_vote_score": "0.886265277862548828", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12315800": {"recommendationid": "12315800", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998237829", "num_games_owned": 316, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 77854, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545010226}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is so addictive, while trying not to starve on the game you may starve in real life, you won't sleep and you will go insane keeping your charactor alive. \nThis should come with a health warning but the games name should be a reminder in itself, maybe add an ingame timer that saves the game and tells the player 'eat and go to bed' after they've been playing 20 hours.\n\nIf you have lots of spare time this game is definitly worth it's money.", "timestamp_created": 1412184068, "timestamp_updated": 1412184068, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 29, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848357021808624268", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12566010": {"recommendationid": "12566010", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995976482", "num_games_owned": 318, "num_reviews": 71, "playtime_forever": 234, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413864455}, "language": "english", "review": "Aside from ridiculously fun gameplay, Don't Starve's art style is eye-candy, reminiscing the feel of a Tim Burton movie adapted into a video game.\n\nDon't Starve doesn't hold your hand at the start.

It has become one of my favorite games and I definitely recommend it.", "timestamp_created": 1461945076, "timestamp_updated": 1461945076, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797957360744476318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9838845": {"recommendationid": "9838845", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045418957", "num_games_owned": 536, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 5261, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471816474}, "language": "english", "review": "Since I have no idea how to review this game, I am just going to tell a tale of one of my adventures.\n\nPlease note, this was played on Reign of Giants 1st update.\n\nDay 1 through 7. Getting Started.\n\nI pick Wilson as my character and start my game. It dumps me in a birch tree biome full of Twigs, Grass, Berries, Carrots and Flint. So I walk around gather all that crap, cut down some trees gathered wood and acorns and made a fire and waited through the night. The next day comes and I start exploring. I come across a biome full of Boulders and Gold nuggets. So I make a Pickaxe and just start going through every Boulder getting Stone, Flint and Gold Nuggets. I did that all day. The next day comes and I went to search for Beefalo. Within the first 2 minutes I find beefalo. My reaction was \u201cYes! I can now get their poo and start a farm!\u201d I then realise I got excited over poo... So I got a bunch of poo and found a decent spot to make my camp. The next day I cut down a ton of trees and made a lot of stone walls and marked my base. Once I had set my walls, I replaced the floor with wooden flooring. Then I placed my Science Machine, Alchemist Machine, Crock Pot, Drying rack, Lightning rod and made 3 improved farms. Everything was going great!. That was all in the first 7 days. \nA great start for me.\n\nDay 8 through 12. The Rise and Fall of Friendship.\n\nI go exploring looking for spider nests for webs and the Pig King for Gold Nuggets and Pig men to recruit for help. I take 4 steps up and boom! Forrest Biome full of spider nests! And right next to biome was the Pig village with the pig king. Having killed a few spiders on the way to finding the Pig king I had some monster meat. So I recruited 2 Pig men called (And I am not kidding you) Nacho and Libre. They helped me out killing spiders and getting webs and they also helped with cutting down trees. The next 4 days pretty much went like this. I got my webs, made the Bug Net, Bird Trap and Tent and then\u2026something I was not expecting happened. You need to keep giving the Pigs meat for them to keep following you and I have been giving them Monster Meat that the Spiders dropped. Day 12 I give the Pig men Monster Meat for the fourth day and\u2026they turned in to Werepigs\u2026 I had to kill them both. So at this point I go on the Don\u2019t Starve Wiki to find out why this had happened. Turns out giving them 4 Monster Meat turns them in to Werepigs\u2026 R.I.P Nacho and Libre. Day 8-12. \n\nDay 13 through 21. Preparing for Winter.\n\nSad. Having killed my fellow Pig friends, I continued on. I go to an unexplored area and I find something surprising! A skeleton with an Ice Box next to him. I smash the Ice Box, take the items and ran back to my camp and made an Ice Box. This made me very happy. Now I can now store food without them going bad in 3 days. This also gave me a purpose to go mine the Ice blocks since Ice never melts in an Ice Box. For pretty much day 14 to 21 I stocked right the up on food. Making several meals from the crock pot and stocking up on Berries and Carrots that I could find. Just before day 21 hits, while just looking around in a forest I find yet another skeleton and this time he had a Winter hat and a Breezy Vest. I had loads of food in the Ice Box I had the perfect clothes and a fully heated Thermal Stone and my beard was fully ready. Bring on winter!\n\nDay 21 through 31. Spelunking and Giant encounter.\n\nWinter arrives! Snow everywhere! PENGUINS! And trying not to freeze to death! Winter was a pretty slow and boring time. Can\u2019t really go out much without freezing so I thought to myself \u201cI\u2019m going to go explore the caves!\u201d Expecting it to be dark and full of bats, I prepared myself. As soon as I go down the cave there was yet another skeleton! This time he had a lantern and a chest full of this green slime. I thought \u201cGreat! This is will get me around the cave without using 50 torches\u201d It didn\u2019t stop the fact that the caves are terrifying! At first it was just a marsh biome with GIANT TENTICLES! trying to kill you. As soon as am out of that biome I enter this new looking place I haven\u2019t seen before\u2026and I encounter something that made me \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 myself! Now keep this in mind, the cave is pitch black and you can only see with a lit source. In this case the lantern I found. The lantern does not light the entire screen. You can only see like 3 feet around you. I encounter ROCK LOBSTERS! Which are (As I find out later) these terrifying yet harmless mob. My first reaction was to turn around and run the \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 out of the cave but I noticed they didn\u2019t follow me. So I approached one and it did not attack me. I learn that you can befriend them by giving them stone. I befriended 1 and continuted. Then I encounter the 2nd most terrifying thing\u2026GIANT BUNNYS! These big furry bunnies are also Harmless and you can befriend them by giving them\u2026Carrots\u2026I also continued on without them. From then on it was just Cave Spiders and Bats. Having explored most of the cave I decide to finally leave it. I resurface only to be attacked by 5 hounds. I don\u2019t attack them. Instead I lure them all the way to the Pig Village and got the pigs to help me out! The hounds died with the cost of 1 Pig man\u2026.So I took the meat he dropped and dried it and made Jerky!\n\nHaving not died in the cave and surviving the hounds I decide to just take these next few day\u2019s slowly. Having planted a load of acorns outside my camp I cut down all the trees and made 3 pig houses just outside my camp. Just in case anything comes to attack me (Like a Giant perhaps). I decide to venture out to more unknown area and I encounter a strange bug, I encounter the Goose Moose in winter. It left me confused considering it is a spring giant. So what did I do? Recruited a bunch Pig men and killed it! And it was successful! I gathered the Meat it dropped and yet again headed home. But on my way over I got caught in the darkness and can to settle in the middle of nowhere. During the night I was attacked by like 6 bats. So during night I was just running around my fire like I was doing a rain dance.\n\nDay 32 through 54 The Quest for the Fire Staff and Leaving the World Behind Me.\n\nThe snow has stopped. The rain continued. And I have literary no worries of dying anymore. I have all the food I need and I have my fellow pig Neighbours for protection. At this point I thought I had nothing else to do. So I wanted to start messing with magic! Luckily I found a bunch of collapsed rabbit holes so I caught 4 of them, made a Top Hat and then made the Prestihatitator. The first thing I made with it was the Meat Effigy which pretty much acts as an 2nd chance if you die with the cost of 20% of your total health. But what I really wanted to make was a Fire Staff. But first you needed a Shadow Manipulator. Which are not easy to make due to the fact you need 3 Living logs and 7 Nightmare Fuel. Getting the Nightmare Fuel was easy but getting the Living Logs was a quest in its self. After many days of searching I finally found a Living Tree and got it. Now with my Shadow Manipulator made I needed 1 red gem. So I found graveyard and started digging graves until I got one. Literary the 2nd grave had a red gem. So I was happy. I made my Fire Staff and it was total worth losing lots of my sanity! I burned Bees, Spiders and an ENTIRE FOREST!. So that was fun! and pretty much from then I had a daily life and I left it on day 54. During all of this I happened to find all 4 of the \u201cthing\u201d items to enter a new world. Having explored the entire world and not wanting to stay any longer, I head over to the \u201cWooden Thing\u201d location. Knowing it is guarded by the Clockwork mobs I of course, yet again, had a pig army!. We made our way over, killed the mobs and I said goodbye to the world and my fellow Pig friends. I have yet to start the new world. \n\nThe End.\n\nI love this game. 10/10", "timestamp_created": 1397716861, "timestamp_updated": 1419557759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768103599548339844", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7935434": {"recommendationid": "7935434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198003062458", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 1009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1444626835}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros:\n+ Randomly generated worlds with varying resources and NPC's\n+ The option to create custom worlds\n+ Tons of items to harvest, craft, use and eat\n+ Immense world to explore\n+ Original and fitting art style\n+ Great sound design and music\n+ Immense replayability and depth\n+ Supports mods; has many great mods available through Steam Workshop\n+ Frequent content updates\n+ Gain experience after each death to unlock additional characters to play as; each character has their own passive abilities that changes the way you play\n\nCons:\n- Large learning curve with no in-game help or tutorials\n- Combat is frustrating and basic\n- The game is designed around grinding, and you'll never do anything but.\n\nWho should buy this game?\n*Fans of sandbox survival games such as Minecraft\n*Fans of Klei Entertainment\n*Those who enjoy slower-paced games centered around creativity and patience\n\n\nReplayability Value: Very high, tons of stuff to do and with randomly generated new content each playthrough you'll have a different experience with each world.\n\nPrice Range: $15 bucks or lower, you can easily get your money's worth.", "timestamp_created": 1386311675, "timestamp_updated": 1427653810, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 78, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.824002385139465332", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27277281": {"recommendationid": "27277281", "author": {"steamid": "76561198005306524", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 81103, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549746528}, "language": "english", "review": "Too much of a time sink.

Then you will see an evil shadow hand come to steal your fire and envelop you in darkness.\n\n+It's downright witty and fun.\n\nThere are no negatives to Don't Starve: this is game at it's finest. \n-Developers open to suggestion, always adding new and exciting content.\n-A welcoming and inspiring community.\n-A game that challenges you to think but remains fun.\n", "timestamp_created": 1416608268, "timestamp_updated": 1416608268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.758554637432098389", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8292481": {"recommendationid": "8292481", "author": {"steamid": "76561198022876509", "num_games_owned": 300, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417338825}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: Well looks like wherever I got the multiplayer information from is wrong(?).

This is probably a more realistic approach to what surviving is really like but with an obvious cartoony visual. This game requires its player to always be thinking about what to do next so that they can always be prepared for a bad situation. Don't Starve is a very fun and feels refreshing each time you play, the characters with unique abilities and the randomised maps help the game stay addictive and attractive for a long time. It has an absoultely huge variety of gameplay and things to do and explore.\n\nI would have to say the only two cons there are with this game are there is absolutely no chance of multiplayer (apparently something with the scripting idk) and that if you get ambushed by monsters, all your hard work will literally just disappear, aka sometimes its just too easy to die.\n\n9.2/10 definently my favourite indie game at the moment", "timestamp_created": 1388046988, "timestamp_updated": 1457394626, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.755576968193054199", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "5123507": {"recommendationid": "5123507", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045307497", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 8381, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451160913}, "language": "english", "review": "What is Don't Starve all about?\n\nDon't Starve is a survival horror game that drops the character in an open and fully explorable world filled with numerous monsters and many interactive objects. This is a must buy for anyone who enjoys a game where the player is given total freedom to do what they want, how they want and when they want. So as a player and big fan here is my own personal experience on such an awesome single player experience game. \n\nJ20Hawkz Personal Opinion\n\nI have been playing this game since early release and still find it extremely hard to stop playing it. Personally for me I enjoy adventure, action and rpg, Don't Starve combines all three in a unique way and blends in survival horror and a sort of farming, resource hoarding element also. If you enjoyed playing games such as Animal Crossing and Harvest Moon you will definitely feel right at home playing this. The added twist is you are always on your feet to make sure you don't go insane and lose health. Oh and of course don't starve. \n\nSeasons, Days, Interactions\n\nAlmost everything can be interacted with, from catching small butterflies and bees to having epic battles with huge lumbering monsters that hunt you in the coldest and hardest of times. Yes Don't Starve has seasonal changes, and not only do you live to survive, you must survive to live. Days go from light to dark, they don't last very long making it all important you do enough to survive the dark night and start again when the sun comes out. Anything that moves and would potentially pose a threat can harm the player if you choose to get too close or in some way anger it. \n\nWeapons, Traps, Armour, Food\n\nCraft weapons, armour, traps and walls to defend yourself against continuous threat. Capture, kill, gather and cook food to make sure your hunger never drops. Everything you see can be used to collect valuable resources that will be used to craft hundreds of helpful survival items. \n\nExplore a living world\n\nNot only are we free to explore a fairly large open map, we can also go deeper into the caves and explore a strange and creepy ancient world. With the addition of such levels Don't Starve replay ability went through the window. Again exploring either the world above ground or venturing deep into the darkness of the caves, is all up to the player. There are no strings attached. You do as you wish. \n\nMinor Issues\n\nThere are some minor faults with the game, but the team behind this game are very supportive and at least one member is on hand to help sort out any technical issues or those annoying bugs we encounter while playing. Never have I seen a more committed development team than Klei. Most questions can be answered by reading the community made Don't Starve Wiki, you can also visit the Official Klei site and post questions or reply to other friendly members of the Don't Starve community. The Steam Don't Starve forum is also a good place to share or ask what's on your mind. \n\nDeath\n\nDeath can be a pain, if you die that's it, you have to start all over again. The further you get is based on the number of days survived. However you gain experience points based on this number that is used to unlock other playable characters all of which have unique aspects about them. There are ways of avoiding a permanent game ending death so not all hope is lost. \n\nPlay alone or together\n\nDon't Starve was originally planned as a Single player game only. On the 6th of May 2014 multiplayer was announced for late summer 2014. More to follow. \n\nFinally\n\nAll in all, this game is a great single player oriented experience. The achievements we get is what we find hard and over come. With no online capabilities or steam associated achievements, some may find this game not worth buying. However if those are the only negatives in a game you will be hard pressed to find something that is as captivating as Don't Starve.  \n\nI give this game a solid 85/100.\n\nHere is just one example of what can be made in Don't Starve. \n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=151738059", "timestamp_created": 1370345914, "timestamp_updated": 1400661077, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 119, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837073624134063721", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7740830": {"recommendationid": "7740830", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042792798", "num_games_owned": 446, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5044, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1472263155}, "language": "english", "review": "This game offers hours of endless fun (and sometimes, frustration)!

It could be the fear of a wild animal tearing apart your fragile corner of civilization, or simply the sickening realization that you planned poorly and you're going to starve to death. Don't Starve capitalizes on both of these fears and more, pitting you against a stretch of nature that isn't just inhospitable, but actively seeks your destruction. And if that sounds stressful and downright painful at times, you should have a good idea of what you're getting into.\n\nDon't Starve starts you off with a spread of characters to choose from (with more to unlock) and world customization options, and then deposits you into an isometric wilderness. Just about every object in the world is interactable and will become important to your survival and prosperity, but the initial steps are simple enough. Flint and twigs make tools for chopping wood and mining stone, which can be refined further into building materials that unlock new equipment options. You'll be setting up fully-featured camps but be aware that cabins and castles aren't in the cards... the best you can do is walls and some simple flooring.\n\nThis feeling of permanent exposure is important to the atmosphere, because you are never fully safe in this cruel world. There's a pervasive sense of ancient evil to everything, from the twisted trees to the dead-eyed spiders to the writhing tentacles beneath the marshes. One key to survival is light, because without it the pitch-black night is certain death. I'm not just waxing poetic here, if you get caught in the dark for more than about five seconds, you die. But even a roaring campfire is no guarantee that marauding wolves, angry frogs, or far larger things won't end your life.\n\nDeath is where the real tension of the game is, because death is permanent. No do-overs, no checkpoints, no reloads. When you die, that character and that world are gone. Now, permadeath has proven to work for short roguelikes but a game where you spend hours exploring a world and building a settlement is a whole different ballgame, and it's here that Don't Starve threatens to lose most of its audience. Dying in this game really, really, [i]really[/i] sucks, because it's always from something perfectly avoidable, comes so quick, and wipes out literal hours of progress.\n\nSo why beat your head against this game? Because as long as you DON'T die, it's an excellent survival simulator. You'll never reach a point where you're fully comfortable in the world, and there are always greater beasts and scarier places to overcome. Even the most basic materials remain relevant as your mastery over the land grows, and while you gain new ways to make gathering resources quick and painless, you still have survival tasks to complete. Eventually you'll be cultivating farms, researching artifacts, and preparing for harsh winters, all of which are involved and gratifying goals.\n\nYou'll have to deal with some trial and error in finding the best ways to survive and use what you find, and that can mean some frustration as you learn to deal with food spoiling or beekeeping or other surprisingly lethal pastimes. But once you do there's a big, strange world to explore, and that's really only the beginning. There's a story mode hidden out there in the wilds that you'll only find once you master survival, and getting through THAT is its own grand adventure. Wrapped up as it is in charming hand-drawn graphics and rich sound design, there's plenty to keep you invested in Don't Starve. It's a game that asks for a lot of patience and understanding, but it's one of the few that really earn it, too.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

It truly shines in comparison to the other modern survival games.The art style really fits with the game's setting, making for one of the best immersion experiences out there.Other survival games *cough* The Forest *cough* give you a handful of starting items and tips when you press the magnificent \"new game\" button.Well,no,\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 you, The Forest.In Don't Starve,you are told literally NOTHING about the enviroments that surround you,what can kill you, or what is edible.It is the authentic survival experience, where you wake up in the middle of nowhere, with absolutely no idea of what you are going to do next.That brings me to the learning curve. It is a really harsh and unforgivable one (Dark Souls style),but once you get used to it, and that should be after your first 5 worlds created, you will get the hang of what's what in the world of Don't Starve.Heat kills you, hunger kills you,spiders kill you,pretty much never ask yourself the question \"what does that thing do?\".You will regret it a short 10 seconds afterwards.Where the gameplay can't do the job, atmosphere is further more created by the Tim Burton-ish twisted art style,with a slight touch of a cartoon character design.This game is also a true teacher. In my humble 30-ish hours of trying not to starve, I learned that frustration never leads to something good,so don't get mad the first 5 times when you die,it's part of the game, and it's a healthy method of learning the ropes and the mechanics.Basically, the trial and error system would be the best description of your first playthroughs.The game is full of new content, it makes sure that you always discover something just when you tought that there couldn't be more to it, so don't worry, it is NOT a short game, nor one with an empty open world.The DLC, Reign of Giants and Shipwrecked, expand the content of it to whole new levels,easily adding 60 more hours of gameplay to the 50-ish of the original content and the 100+ ones that mods add, and (I can't believe I'm saying it), they are worth their full price.\n\n\nVerdict: If you want a serious survival game with tons of content and an expansive open world, tough with a harsh learning curve, but that is worth your time, Don't Starve is perfect for you.Actually,scratch that,Don't Starve is for you no matter what kind of survival game you are looking for.Just try it,because I'm giving it a 10/10.", "timestamp_created": 1466926578, "timestamp_updated": 1466926578, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.656517684459686279", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13737909": {"recommendationid": "13737909", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061142502", "num_games_owned": 227, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 1761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1420303968}, "language": "english", "review": "Don't starve rules: \n\n1: dont starve\n2: Monsters dont kill.

I appear in a strange new world only to be suddenly confonted by a sleek man wearing a rather dapper suit and top hat! I was confused and scared, yet somehow comforted by the man, probably due to the strong sence of security he held. I could roughly make out the words: \"Say pal, you don't look so good.\" \"You'd better find something to eat before night comes!\" his figure then swiftly decended into the ground in a puff of smoke. I trembled, I had somehow braised my knee, as I rose to my feet, my head dizzy and aching. i didn't have a clue how I got here, I only knew that I had to find some food and some supplies to make it through the night. Frantically, I began to run across the luscious meadow in search of some food that I could ravage.\n\nAfter what seemed hours, I finally spotted a bush that contained some sort of red, exotic berry that I could pick. As I approched the bush It became clear to me that the berries could be poisonous, despite their decieving looks. However as I looked up to the sky and took a glimpse of the savage birds circling me, I saw that the only viable option, and inevitable, was to rob the bush of its resources. I reached for the crimson berries, my mouth watering, when out of the blue a majestic turkey looking creature sprung from the bush, stole the berries and made its escape with great speed. I set off to chase the gobbler, that is what I had come to call it due to its adept ability to steal berries, however realising it was beyond my reach, I took off in another direction looking for another cache of food. \n\nHours later the sun began to set and the birds flew away to some distant land as if they were afraid of something. I had aquired a vast quantity of sticks, flintstones and grass tufts on my travels, but still no food. I had lost all hope on finding any source of sustenance and my chances of survival, yet the image of the dark, sleek man was the coal in the furnace of my shrivelled body. Suddenly a rare sight in this harsh world: a dead rabbit; mine for the taking. I lifted its limp corpse as saliva built up in my mouth. It was time. Without realising, a dark blanket covered the sky in a matter of seconds, envoloping my body in total darkness. But I didn't care. I became a feral beast and ripped into the lifeless rabbit with my teath, tearing its flesh from its body. However I felt a tickle on my leg, something had brushed passed me. I took no notice and continued with my soul rejuvenating meal. Before I realised my legs were ripped out of their sockets, cold blood splattering across my face. I screamed for help, but only recieved the soft, lonely chirping of the crows. I lay there for a few seconds reviewing the few hours I had lived, cuddling what was left of my rabbit, before my head was pulled from my neck in a slight struggle. In my last few seconds all I heard were the wicked screeches of the wind and the laughing of the dark, sleek man.\n\nBrilliant game with a fantastic community, I love this game and is one of my all time games.
