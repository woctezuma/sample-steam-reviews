He saw a business opportunity here and released NewZ. But he wasn't happy with his community, it was still too small. His only option was to ruin all his competition, hence he started releasing cheating tools for all the competing emulators, while keeping his own protected from said tools. This ruined dozens of Infestation emulators, but with the fan base the game had, some were not yet done with it, hence NewZ started to grow.\n\nHammerpoint Interactive, who has been a controversial company from the beginning, was taking a huge hit in their income and they eventually started cutting on their investments for servers, Infestation Survivor Stories is dead by now, just with a few dozen servers in North America. Players have been scammed all around. The game was removed from Steam for blatant false advertisement, its name was taken down on copyright grounds against World War Z trademark owners, they blatantly stole artwork from AMC's The Walking Dead, didn't even bother hiring a lawyer to write their software Terms of Service, so they just copy pasted from Riot Games' League of Legend and were caught doing so once again, not to mention all their shameful community interactions, ranging from Sergey Titov calling \"\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665s\" to its players on his own public forum. Thankfully I have gotten my refund from Hammerpoint, so I have nothing really against them, but I know many people who fallen for this scam since shortly after I've gotten my refund they stopped issuing them and never gotten their money back.\nAnyway, Hammerpoint was still not done juicing this rushed copied concept of theirs, they've sold the rights to distributing their game to Fredaikis after seeing no other option to keep profiting from their software, they've literally given out their game to some teenager who ruined theirs. Fredaikis founded Fredaikis AB and now is distributing Infestation: New Z, yet he hasn't stopped its illegal practises and is still breaking every Intellectual Propriety protection law copying textures from Valve's Counter Strike Global Offensive amongst other equally serious offences.\n\n\nYet and anyway I believe you fanboys won't believe half of this probably, to you Fredaikis is just some kind of saviour, when in fact he's nothing but a nasty teenager criminal and should be stopped at all cost, here's some proof to you guys.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ko6DHIJ.png <- Here we can see this steam account of his linked to the Greenlight item he submitted to steam.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/fbZOqtx.png <- Here we can see that account has a VAC ban, but it gets funnier :)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Dtjc4i3.png <- Quick search for his name on Google, here's a post he makes on a cheating forum publishing a tool that has ruined Hammerpoint Interactive's Infestation Survivor Stories, thousands upon thousands of people have downloaded this.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/3opLQvF.png <- Over 39000 people have downloaded JUST his latest version of this tool, hundreds of thousands more have downloaded his previous versions all combined, if the number doesn't reach over a million. Now you can see why there were so many cheaters on Infestation. \nhttp://i.imgur.com/G2xiM7B.png <- But he was not done yet. No. He had to ruin his competition at all, getting all people to play NewZ :)\nhttp://i.imgur.com/g5SuVd4.png <- But wait, he still had to try to ruin Counter Strike:Global Offensive didn't he?

It\u2019s rife with bugs and other tech issues, and the large amount of guns has turned it into a place where meaningful player interactions rarely occur. It needs a lot of work to become something that feels like a proper release, and is in dire need of the slew of promised features to make it more than rarely entertaining. This is a prime example of a game that oversells and underdelivers.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggeBZVja6Cc", "timestamp_created": 1520967529, "timestamp_updated": 1531431033, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 119, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902601420879364014", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28152968": {"recommendationid": "28152968", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083719331", "num_games_owned": 392, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 63, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1481243356}, "language": "english", "review": "- Start up game for the first time\n- Sign up for spam emails\n- Get to main menu\n- Have to click on an option 5 times to work\n- Go to options\n- Try to turn off fullscreen, doesn't work\n- Try to join a beginner server\n- Disconnected for not having a character\n- Go to make a character\n- Game freezes every time clothing is changed\n- Try again to join a beginner server\n- Disconnected\n- Try to join another beginner server\n- Disconnected\n- Try to join an official server\n- Disconnected for not having a premium account/1hr of playtime\n- Try joining ANOTHER beginner server\n- Finally connects\n- Sit through painfully long loading screen cycling between 2 slides\n- Game freezes for 30 seconds\n- Finally in-game\n- Try to walk around\n- Game freezes\n- Let go of W\n- Game unfreezes\n- Press W again\n- Game freezes again\n- Press shift to sprint\n- Game unfreezes, then freezes again\n- Try to disconnect from server\n- Game gets stuck on disconnecting screen\n- Force close the game\n- Uninstall and write this review\n\nUpdate: I fixed the freezing problem by disabling any non-Steam overlay.

When I wrote the original review (scroll to the bottom to read it), I didn't play The New Z, but played the game that The New Z replaced in Steam's library and hence got its ID. Which one it was, I don't know.\n\nWaiting for DayZ (oh, how the kings have fallen), I was one of the many buyers of The War Z and also one of the many who refunded the game. I didn't do it because of false advertising which was the main reason why Steam approved refunds, but of constant bugs, glitches and bad optimization. It was simply a bad game, no matter its status (I think it was alpha back then). After The War Z came Infestation: Survivor Stories. It failed horribly. After that one came 'spiritual succesor' (Insert Michael Scott's NO GIF) Romero's Aftermath which I've downloaded because of, well yes, George A. Romero who's work I deeply respect and appreciate.\n\nI don't know if any other games came after that one, but the latest one, The New Z, appeared on my Steam store's frontpage a few days ago. And the reson why I wrote negative review instantly is because it looked suspiciously similar to previous titles. \n\nI've clicked, as I always click on any zombie FPS with survival tag. I am still looking for the perfect one, after years and years of purchasing and trying out mediocre, if not terrible products that simply fail to deliver the fun mixture between realism and FPS chaos. Unfortunately, most of survival titles on Steam are nothing more than wagons on the hype train, except few notable exceptions (I am looking at you, The Long Dark, Subnautica and The Forest).\n\nThe New Z is marked as ultimate free-to-play experience, combining three closely related genres into one: battle royale, survival and open world.\n\nLet's start with the best one, at least in my own not so humble opinion. Survival is slow paced horror of surviving days and night in hostile environment. Resources are scarce, zombies are many and mainly located around loot areas and community is almost completely comprised of soloists who kill on sight. I've been trying to find players to join group for hours and only twice people responded and added me to their group. Playing this mode in the long run proved non-productive because at the end, you'll be starving and unless you have free bus ticket or can afford pricey one (more about it later), you may leave yourself stranded away from any potential food and water source. Strength in numbers, so if you don't have any friends, be prepared for much more difficult journey. The New Z fails grouping the players just as other similar games simply because their zombies are not dangerous enough, they don't present a serious threat to solo players, even unarmed ones.\n\nSurvival map is huge and it takes a lot to travel it on foot. There are small stashes of resources scattered around the map which are not marked on the map, so exploring can be rewarding, but make sure you're prepared. My favorite part of the day was dusk turning into a night. \n\nIf you get tired of surviving and need to take a break, there are several safe zones marked on the map. Here, there's no shooting and you can leave your extra stuff in the vault, so it waits for you when you come back or in case you die. Next to these are bus stations which are really useful for fast travel, but once you're out of free tickets, you either need to relay on buying bus tickets or getting premium account (more about that later) which allows for free bus transport. \n\nOpen World is PVP oriented mode. Smaller maps, more aggressive and diverse zombie types (huge one, fast one, lots of classic ones) and numerous loot instances. Here it's all about kill or be killed and your round will finish much earlier than expected, especially if you're not precise with your weapons. \n\nBattle Royale, one of the selling points of this free-to-play game was something I couldn't try at all because of technical problems most players encounter, a black screen upon entering the server. Game starts with players gathering in the lobby and shooting each other relentlessly until the countdown begins. It is 100 player game, but most players I had on server was around 40. Unfortunately, after the countdown ends and real royale begins, my screen went black. Changing graphic details never did anything, so I cannot judge this mode, but I have to say I didn't get a chance to play it at all. \n\nJudging from my previous experiences, The New Z is plagues by the same technical problems and glitches as its predecessors. There are a lot of getting stuck glitches and fall damage glitches. I've encountered a few sound glitches as well. The biggest problem were the same, clumsy zombie animations. Zombie combat isn't really revolutionary - you aim for the head, unless you have a melee weapon, then you aim for the weapon and move back and forth, trying to calculate when the next swing of zombie arms will happen. Zombies are sometimes hit during their hit animations, so it resets and drops a few frames of the next one, landing you a hit when you don't expect one. \n\nThe biggest problem of The New Z is its microtransactions, which make The New Z more of a freemium game than anything else. Beside normal, free accounts, you have a chance to purchase different tiers of premium accounts with different perks, ranging from smallest, priced at around 2,60 \u20ac per month (pretty much useless), up to lifetime premium priced 200 \u20ac. Beside that you get to buy Game Coins, a premium value that's being used for almost everything in the game. I am type of player who can play the game without purchasing anything and still have fun, but I do have a problem with this business practice. Some of it is pretty ridiculous, you need to pay for private servers, skinboxes are overpriced (any let's be honest, some of these skins are DAMN UGLY) and you can even pay to reset player timer (when your character dies, a certain amount of time needs to pass so you can use the player again).\n\nI'm on the fence about player progression system presented in the game. You can use XP points gained by killing to upgrade your character's stats. It gives a certain amount of depth to the game, but on the other hand, advantages gained can present a huge problems for up and coming players.\n\nIn terms of Dungeons & Dragons alignment system, if The War Z and it's successors were chaotic evil characters, The New Z is chaotic neutral; D'n'D Player's Handbook states that chaotic neutral characters 'promote the ideals of freedom, it is their own freedom that comes first; good and evil come second to their need to be free', meaning although The New Z is being promoted as free-to-play title, you will in the process lose either money (buying stuff) or time (surival games are interesting, but without truly deep system and some goals, ultimately pointless), and let's not even start talking about your nerves when you drop dead because of game bugs and glitches.\n\nIn the oversatured market of bad zombie survival FPS/TPS shooter games (minus Miscreated, I haven't played it yet), The New Z may be the king, but the one eyed in the land of the blind. And that's not something to be proud of. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nSo basically, it's the \"brand new\" game that I've somehow miraculously already played without even knowing about it. \n\nJust seeing models, menus and FONT gives me idea this is one of million of WarZ, Infestation, Romero's Aftermath, what's-the-latest-name-for-it clones pumped up on microtransactions, ready to be shut down at certain point and replaced with the next one. \n\nSteam should really get this shit sorted, I prefer having idiotic visual novels swarm all over Steam's store page over this.\n\nNO. \nNO.\nNO.\nNO.\nNO.", "timestamp_created": 1510869234, "timestamp_updated": 1511183315, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 154, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.879278242588043213", "comment_count": 53, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "Hey!\n\nSince you wrote this review at a moment we still hadn't updated our Steam page. (Yes, we did a rework and we rewrote every single text.) I can understand where you're coming from. I would just like to explain that we have addressed VERY clearly in the game's description back than that The New Z was AND IS a re-edition of the original \"Infestation: Survivor Stories\". Next to that it's free to play meaning you are not forced neither promised anything. I would highly recommend that IF you download any game on Steam to always read the summary of the game because we have done everything we could to make sure player's were aware of this. At the same time I would understand the issue more IF the game would be costing money, where in that case I would understand your point of view, but the game is free to play. Sorry if I'm addressing this in any negative way, just want to make this as clear as possible.\n\nOn top of that I see you're more of \"complaining\" about the fact that the game in certain aspects is the same as original \"Infestation: Survivor Stories\" but then again, you could've known that before downloading the game in first place.\n\nAnyways, where you're referring to \"ready to be shut down at certain point\" I can also understand why you're saying that based on the past BUT, I think you and I can both agree on the fact that as of right now, where we are 1 year after the game's Steam release, where the game is still being played and the servers are still online, I think we as developers have proven enough that this \"wasn't just another game ready to be shut down\". Next to that WE ARE a complete different and independent  development team and the longer this game is online and running and the more we keep listening to our community we prove that point even more.\n\nAnyways, thanks for taking your time to write this review. I hope to have you updated on certain things and I hope stuff is a bit more clear now.\n\nIf you have any more questions feel free to ask them!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nSven"}, "36027954": {"recommendationid": "36027954", "author": {"steamid": "76561198197157207", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 7452, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510606042}, "language": "english", "review": "The game itself is not bad, but it's too flawed to give it a positive rating.

At the same time cars can be find able (for free) too.\n\n\"- players who only started have a disadvantage of skills\"\n^ When it comes to the \"Open World\" game mode directly that is true. As \"Open World\" is more PvP focussed and at the same time there's been people playing that game mode for years now, everyone pretty much \"has everything\" at a certain state.\nI would like to know however, if you have tried our \"Survival\" game mode? This game mode is just like Open World but loot is very hard to get meaning no one really has anything good yet. It's pretty fun to play actually!\n\n\"- not new players on beginner server\"\nTrue. Beginner Servers have actually been removed from the game particially because of this reason. Thanks for this feedback anyways, I suppose when you wrote this review beginner servers were still active.\n\n\"- hacker and spawn camp killers especially on cali\"\n^ Are you 100% certain you experienced playing against a \"hacker\"? A lot of players seem to be complaining about the spawn system. What do YOU think is a good way to improve this?\n\nBefore jumping in the \"Battle Royale\" game mode part I would like to address that we have a very big Battle Royale patch planned for the upcoming weeks where we aim to have a new lobby / queue up system finished, a new map and more advanced leaderboards including ELO and more statistics.\n\n\"Battle Royale: - since an update group option is no longer available\"\n^ True, because we had some people with abusing groups but we are also working on a lobby / queue up system for Battle Royale allowing players to play with their friends from there. This is aimed to be in the next upcoming patch actually!\n\n\"- voicechat, why is it even there when it's everyone v everyone, people only insult others\" \n^ Why voice chat is there, why not, is more a personal opinion thing. I understand some people like it and some people don't. For now voice chat has been enabled because in one way it's kind of funny. <- That's just my opinion.\n\n\"- can't delete the existing character like in open world and name change is expensive\"\n^ Thanks for pointing this out. I'll write this down and see what we can do about this.\n\nThanks for the overall feedback.

My experience with it has been about what I expected, and since so many reviews aren't very helpful, I will try to be. \n\n1. Community is what you'd expect from any game like this.\n\n-Pros will kill you for the can of soda you picked up a second prior.\n\n-Noobs will kill you on sight to level up their characters.\n\n-Everyone else either wants to team, or collect items for their global storage.\n\n2. Game play is different than most games I have played.\n\n-There is a global storage system that allows players to go into a server with an arsenal they like or have previously survived with.\n\n-You can make groups with friends or clans to work together against others or solo it and still be just as effective.\n\n-Super zombies will relentlessly chase you if they are aggroed and unprepared players will die every time.\n\n-Upon death you drop all items and are forceably removed from the server. Then you must either pay in game currency to wind down the timer, or simply wait a few minutes to respawn. To bypass this entirely, you could make multiple characters.\n\n-Upon spawning back in it is possible to find your dropped items, but getting to them before another player does is unlikely.\n\n3. In game currency.\n\n-there are two types of ingame currency: real money and zombie money. While probably not their actual names, zombie money is obtained by killing stuff and is generally above 50$ per kill. The highest I have gotten so far is $1248 for killing a zombie with a melee headshot.

I watched the cool vids that came up for this game and i really liked the concept of spawning almost naked and ending up with good weaponry and cool gadgets. You know, run around like The Walking Dead series, meeting other survivors and shooting the undead.\n\n[h1]Reality[/h1]\n[list]\n[*]The game is a [b]loading screen simulator[/b]. It takes about 8 to 10 mins to join a server. That's not even the worst part. \n\n[*]The game thinks that [b]TeamViewer[/b] running in the background [b]is a suspected cheating program[/b]. It took me a while to find out. i wasted 40 mins trying to connect to servers until i found it out.\n[/list]\n\nOnce i got in a server, i crawled around and found a ton of things, like an MG, a freaken Katana, and a bunch of other cool stuff and logged out after a while to avoid getting killed. The second time i joined a server i was shot almost instantly and i lost everything. + the revive counter is total crap. [b]And that's how it kept going[/b]. Spawning in small villages and getting my head opened by a sniper from an unknown position.\n\n[h1]But hey![/h1]\n\nMe and a friend (we almost got in a fight cause of the game) who ended up following me through all this crap, found a house to stay and took down people that used to pass by.\n\nAfter we finally found each other (since [b]we were spawned really really far from each other[/b]) we found a house and killed some guys, granting us great stuff they already had.\n\n[h1]and that was it.[/h1]\nafter all this \"action\", [b]me and my friend kept camping[/b] in that house, lying down so we dont get shot and lose everything, not moving at all so we dont attract zombies. for many hours, killing people that kept passing by [b](that means that the game forces you to become an A-hole and just kill people in fear)[/b] until we were both killed by others and never run the game again. Where's the zombie killing spirit?!?!?\n\n[h1]My opinion[/h1]\nIt's a grinder(?) game without a story or a purpose. Low FPS, poor mechanics, lots of bugs and a really bad gameplay. Why would anyone want to hide forever in fear of dying and losing everything? What's the point in all this? That's [b]really hostile to new players[/b] who haven't collected much too.\n\nThe [b]devs don't seem to care[/b] about what players say and keep doing their things. Mostly adding new stuff without re-evaluating older problems and solving them. No doubt why this game is being downvoted like hell. \nThe game had a lot of potential but devs killed it.

This was my experience....\nOriginally posted by ElChupacabra:\nCould you please either email us at support@playnewz.com or contact us at playnewz.com/support.php so you don't have to share your account email here?\n\nDev was responding to another thread about my not being able to access my original account.\n\nMy response...\n\n\nDon't bother. I made a new account to try it out and was literally just about to uninstall it. \n\nFirst of all the Battle Royale mode is terrible. You spawn on the ground already next to people and most of the time you can't even take 3 steps without dying. This is after the ridiculous wating period where EVERYONE literally spawns on top of each other and CAN shoot and kill players. So I spent 30 seconds literally listening to the death music over and over resetting. \n\nOpen world is another joke. There are literally guns every 2 steps and full cmags and snipers and meds and armor in every single spawn I saw (which there are about a million). It completely takes away from farming and looting stuff. Why bother even going to safe zones at all when you can just walk 3 steps in any direction and be fully geared. \n\nI spawned in a remote camp and within a minute I was fully decked with 4 snipers , 3 M249's and PKM's , a few stanag rifles and about 3000 bullets. The immersion in the game is gone. Farming is absolutely pointless. I had 8 medkits , 12 DX's and dozens of other meds.\n\nI killed 3 pvp'ers and made my way to the nearest safe zone. While on the way I realized what I wrote above. WHY THE \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665 am I even going to a safe zone and then the game crashed while I was literally in the middle of nowhere in the woods. Just walking.\n\nNo ty. I gave it a chance. It \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing sucks even more then before. Who cares if there are no hackers. The abundance of loot was enough to drive me away from the game instantly and if that wasn't enough the game is still crashing randomly after YEARS of it. \n\nAnd btw I read somewhere that you took out the Gravestone's. Guess what. No you didn't. They are still there when you kill someone.\n\n \n       \nYou took ALL the immersion out of the game and completely obliviated the entire point of looting and farming. \n\nOh and the game was still running like crap at around 35 FPS. I am running a GTX 970. There was stuttering and even a bit of screen tearing.\n\nI even headshotted a fresh spawn with a Mauser 4 times and he didn't die. He just stood there in the window taking potshots at me with a Stanag rifle.\n\nNo \u2665\u2665\u2665\u2665ing ty.\n\nAnd if that wasn't enough your \"MLG anticheat\" is so broken it can't distinguish between players lagging cause of your crap servers and game and actual cheaters. So there is a ton of people getting falsely banned. And your mods are blaming players while the dev is stating they know its their fault and are looking into it to try and fix it.\n\nSeriously didn't think it could actually be worse then the last time.

So I've got 10 hours into the game. At first, it was a rough start. At this stage, I think I could claim Infestation as a simplified, cheaper version of the Arma II Dayz mod. Dayz lite. And, for a *FREE* game, it's damn good, imo. Damn good. It was completely what I was looking for. However. Food is especially scarce in this game. Especially scarce. I might want to support the development, as well, because of how well I think they did with the game. However, I did have a couple issues lagging up and the game freezing. 2 times out of 10 hours.\n\nThere is also a real sense of anxiety when you see other players. \"Are they a good guy? Are they a bad guy? Will they shoot me or give me medical supplies?\" I love that aspect. It's not all player killers, not in PvE, anyway. A player gave me, like, 15 medical supplies and food when I was injured. Though, you definitely still want to be careful if you hear gunfire.l It's fun to run around meeting people, and the in-game voice chat is cool. Though, it kind of sucks that when you're in a group, you can't really voice chat to them privately. When you talk, everyone in proximity will hear you, which makes operations a bit problematic.\n\nAnother issue is that groups are limited to 3, so I was told by a player. I'm not sure what reasoning they had for this, since cars can fit 6-9 people in them.\n\nI googled the game and saw there used to be a bunch of spawn killers who would camp on spawnpoints and kill new players. Thankfully, temporary invincibility (I think), solves that issue. I haven't been spawn killed, at all.\n\nYou'll spend most of your time running around trying to find food and liquid. [And of course, killing zombies and either avoiding or teaming up with players--or killing them on sight, if you're a jerk] It's a bit ironic to me that guns and military grade vests are much, much, much easier to find than food. It was very frustrating to me, starting out. And I get it. Zombie Apocolypse. Most of the food has been eaten.\n\nBut, have most of the animals been eaten, too? All of the plant life? Adding in some alternate sources of food wouldn't hurt, imo. In addition, your character will starve to death in, like, an hour gametime. Maybe sooner, I haven't timed it. This equals like, maybe a day in-game. More like half a day, if you ask me. Now. Starving to death due to not eating for half a day--or even two days--doesn't really make sense to me. So it was quite irritating. As you gain experience points, you can invest in skills which allow you to last longer without food. My advice is kill as many zombies as you can, because, it seems that killing is the only way to gain experience. First skill you buy is in the survival tree, so you can last longer without food.\n\nMy first few attempts were riddled with irritation at being unable to find food.\n\nAlso. There are car spawn locations. There *are* vehicles. And if you know where to find them--like major cities--it makes travel around the map MUCH easier. However, most of the vehicles are just for looks. Which I found a bit unfortunate, but I get it, I guess. You'll notice the specific cars which don't work, and the specific ones that do. Googling would help, as well.\n\nOne other issue I have with the game is how difficult zombies are to kill. It takes around 125 body shots, unarmed, to kill them. Okay, that makes some sense. I couldn't really tell you could aim for the head. It takes 4-10 knife stabs to the head to kill a typical zombie. I suppose this makes some sense for a game's purposes, and it definitely makes zombies a dangerous thing. It was still a bit irritating having to stab a zombie 10 times in the head for it to die. You'll want to be cautious. Some also run faster than you. Thankfully, all zombies except Super Zombies die with one headshot with a firearm.\n\nI think I might be playing this game a lot more. I don't really understand why it has mixed reviews. In my book, this is a gem for a free game. You don't have much to lose giving it a shot. I would just recommend playing for at least 5-10 hours, so you can get over the small learning curve.", "timestamp_created": 1506839923, "timestamp_updated": 1506839923, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.679512262344360352", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28479390": {"recommendationid": "28479390", "author": {"steamid": "76561198017103424", "num_games_owned": 287, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 23866, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550109335}, "language": "english", "review": "If you ever wondered how a crashing simulator looked like, here you go! !", "timestamp_created": 1482202900, "timestamp_updated": 1542940785, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 201, "votes_funny": 138, "weighted_vote_score": "0.740194320678710938", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29412907": {"recommendationid": "29412907", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358378223", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 3887, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501474533}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is absolute garbage.

Its a free to play game. It is not a triple A game and has tons of issues and sometimes you will want to just turn everything off and watch Family Guy but if you give it a chance and get past the start, it is interesting\n\n2. It's a hoarding game. You spawn into the forest and need to get as much supplies as possible, leave game to store, then join again and repeat until you feel like you have the supplies you need. I personally have tons of simple weapons for PVP purposes. Players dont realize that you WILL die and lose things you loved, so stash more so you can come back.\n\n3. You just need to kill players. Sadly you never know whos a friend and who is not so, although douchey, its a part of the game. I personally just try to join servers with less players and scout areas out before i go in.\n\n4. YOU need to make the game. The devs give you tools and game modes but you need to figure out what makes it fun for you. Dont join and only hoard stuff then say the game is boring because thats all it is. if you only do 1 thing, thats all it is for you. Join high pop. servers and player hunt or play the royal mode and try to survive to the end.\n\n5. Take your time. This is not a run and gun zombie game like left for dead. Fire fights with players can take seconds or minutes and you may die without firing a shot. My cousin and i mainly play together and we often end up in a situation where one of us is killed in seconds from an ambush and the other is stuck behind a car trying to figure out whats going on. We have 5 second encounters where we run into a player or 2 and we have 15 minute pot shot fights with a single player.\n\nDont try to make the game something its not and dont expect the game to do everything for you.", "timestamp_created": 1499973162, "timestamp_updated": 1499973162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 21, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.701513350009918213", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26749774": {"recommendationid": "26749774", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989298452", "num_games_owned": 179, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 32, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479835901}, "language": "english", "review": "How terrible.

However as a whole I cannot reccomend this game due to game breaking Bugs/mechanics that ruin the experience overall. I'll start with the positives.\n\n[h1]--PROS--[/h1]\n\n-Decent PvP, with lots of random encounters and epic fire fights. Gunplay seems fairly balanced, with further shots dealing less damage and assault rifles being unreliable for anything but medium range and close range encounters. Also no aspects of Pay to win are present and that is a plus. All store bought items are cosmetic, Vehicles, or just ammo.\n\n-Great PvE, zombies can be snuck past and avoided, they do substantial damage when they hit you, are attracted to gunfire, and are legit scary to fight in swarms.\n\n-Character loadout cutomization is unique, weapon attatchments help you fit weapons for long range or short range, with a wide variety of guns/melee weapons to choose from.\n\n-Global inventory to stash your items you find in the menu screen when you leave the server. This helps you keep loot for the next time you spawn and have a nice collection.\n\n[h1]--CONS--[/h1]\n\nBugs and hackers in this game destroy the games value to the point of it not being consistently playable.\n\n-Hackers/Aimbotters/Wallhackers, many people get banned every time you join a server you will see at least 3-5 people being banned for trying to hack. You would think thats a good thing, but since this game is free to play they will just make another account and try  different programs/strats again until they are in.\n\n-Weapon variety is good but the weapons stats are not diverse enough to justify using but a few of them. Some have exactly the same stats in damage but spread and recoil differences make them obsolete.\n\n-Vehicle Bugs, Vehicles are insanely expensive and can take a long time to grind up enough to get. My first experience with a vehicle accurately details how broken this games bugs are... (Read Below)\n\n[[[  I spawned in an isolated area next to the corner of the map (for safety), spawned my vehicle but it was resting on an incline (hovering and only front wheels touching the ground) and in order to interact with the Stryker vehicle you need access to the top hatch.\n I tried for 15 min to jump on top of it or access it from the sides but no luck.. I had to spawn a Riot shield and place it down to jump on top of it in order to access the vehicle. No biggie right? So i drive it and park it on top of a mountain (flat) and get out to refuel. The vehicle launched me 100ft in the air and dropped me down to 5% HP (luckily i had a medkit..) and then my Stryker proceeded to roll down the mountain... I chased it, got in, rode up and then down the other side of the mountain. Drove it into the woods near a clearing that was also flat, made sure it came to a FULL STOP, got out of the vehicle and was killed instantly by glitching.. Upon respawning and running back, i was ran over by a bandit in his vehicle and he stole all my things.  GG well played. Bad Game mechanics critically Wrecks you dealing 9999 Dmg.  ]]]\n\n-Game devs have given up on making the game better.  What you see is what you get, dont expect fixes or new content or anything of the sort. If you end up playing or supporting this game, know what you are getting into.\n\n\nAll things being, I give this game a broken 4.5/10.  It has playability and fun to be had. But its about as satisfying as smoking a cigarette, you get your nicotine buzz and get some cool smoke to exhale briefly.

Game once again has potential as it is the same copy and paste game before except for aftermath. so game play is the same. I knew what to expect.\n\nprevious games were riddled with hacks cheats and Macro cheats, yes user agreement says macro is cheating.\n\n\nSo not much has changed in this decent game that is poorly ran by the administration. so let me explain this. the game runs on 32 bit and is poorly optimized. It also has various glitches that even a first year computer programmer could fix. these issues go unaddressed.\n\nHacks/cheats\n\nmany people in this game including myself find it amazing how easy it is to spot cheaters, and hackers. between the ESP, lagSwitching, Aimbotting, Speed hacking.\n\nThe same occuring theme with this game with the previous ones is yet again the admins are more concerned with getting skins and event sales than actually fixing the problems with the game. Alot of the problem with this game is the rediculous ammount of disconnects and drops, which if your in a group or party, it kicks you out of party and makes you suseptiable to being TK'd by your own teammates when logging back in. I counted in an 4 hr span of time that i got disconnected 13 times which turns out to be dropped a little over ever 15min, this ABSOLUTELY affects game play and creates frustration. This is not something new, the same problem as with versions of the previous ones were in this game. \n\nall in all the game is poorly managed and fails to create an environment for players to thrive and want to spend their money elsewhere. As i would suggest you do. \n\nThe Good, it is exciting to sneak up and kill another player, the anticipation factor while time goes on weather you will be killed is intense and thrilling. Scavaging is key to gain enough items to sufficently do PVP so a grind factor is there which i dont mind. Sniper rifles are OP af, and rarely do i see player running anything else but snipers.\n\n3 different game modes available which is nice, battle royal, survival and not relased competition.\nCompetition mode has been inactive since i redownloaded the game which now has been over 3 months without release, so go to show priorities.\n\nThere is an PVE option but this game is highly PVP focused and pushed, Expect to lose alot to cheaters and say bye bye to loot that takes you hours to find disapper in seconds, because when you respawn with new gear the cheaters already know where you are and have shots down range within seconds of your spawn timer running out. So losing loot is a regular thing.\n\nI can tell the difference between when getting rekt by a really good play, botter, lucky 3 shot head shot killer, and the average player. Ive played with top 50 players so i know what its like to get obliterated by them, but yet thier movements and bullet shooting continuation after death is all consistent with human game play.\n\nScale 0-10\n\nPlayability-2\nFun Factor-6\nRepeat game play-2\nSupport-1\nAction FPS-9\nPrice-10\nInGameitems-4\n\n\nMy Rig System\nFX6200 6core OC 4.128ghz\nGTX 780 356bit 4gb\n8GB ddr3 OC 1800MHZ\nfatality OCZ 750w PSU\nfirecuda 2TB Shdd", "timestamp_created": 1531672655, "timestamp_updated": 1531672655, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.630041301250457764", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45605095": {"recommendationid": "45605095", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093249969", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 54, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541262075}, "language": "english", "review": "Trash game.

THIS GAME IS FAIRLY PVP FOCUSED AND YOU WILL SEE THIS IN THE LOOT SPAWNS FOR EXAMPLE. Do not go in expecting the ''next best thing'', because it's not and you'll be disappointed.\n\nThe loot drops are abundant. You'll find guns very easily. You'll find bullets very easily. Looting is barely a chore, but to me, still very fun. You can decide to store it all in your global inventory or you can do it mostly like I do; loot a lot, but keep it all on you so when you die (and you will), you'll have to loot all over again instead of being decked out in elite gear right from minute 1. I only keep a few things in my global inventory, like ammo and snipers.  The loot is so abundant because it's primarely a PvP game. I thought I would've disliked it, but it's not all that bad. The beginner servers are ridiculous loot wise, it's a bit better on the normal servers, but you won't have a hard time finding them.\n\nThe anticheat they have in place so far seems to work. Is it flawless? Probably not but barely any anticheat these days is. Even huge AAA titles get hacked, so the fact it stops 99% of the hacks is pretty damn good and I haven't encountered one yet so far.\n\nThese are DIFFERENT developers that bought the license from the previous devs/publishers. This is why they are listed as the publishers, but they do not actually control any of it. They've had an agreement on the license, nothing more. They do not hold any strings, because if they did, trust me it wouldn't be as free2play as it is now.\n\nPay2Win?\nNo, this game is not. Everything you can buy in the shop, you can buy with either in game currency or just loot it. The ONLY things you can buy with real life money are skins and even those are found in game. You cannot buy guns in the shop. You can buy ammo, but only with in game currency and it's not even expensive. You get a huge amount of dollars per zombie kill, so farming is worth it for that alone. There's barely nothing I haven't been able to buy, but i've actually did not buy a single thing in the shop, not even premium. So far i'm 100% free2play and it's EXTREMELY easy to loot. So people calling this pay2win has lost all meaning to the word pay2win and will slap it on anything that has a cash shop. To them even World of Warcraft is pay2win because you can buy a level 100 character. Or battlefield. Or any other game with microtransactions.\n\nThis game isn't for everyone, i'll admit that. It'll be left with a very experienced veteran community player base that will make your life hell in game. It's not beginner friendly if you're not going in with the idea that you want to learn the game. If you want a loot based survival game, this will probably not be for you. However, do you want a PvP game with actually solid mechanics (even this you can argue about, but it's all opinions) while you have to loot for food and guns/ammo on the side? This game could possibly be it for you.\n\nGraphical wise, this game isn't good. I mean I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the most ugliest game ever, but it certainly isn't th\u00e1t pretty. It has a lot of missing textures, the animations are clunky and overall leaves a lot to be desired to. Graphical wise this game hasn't improved much if any, but hey, let's face it, we all didn't buy minecraft for the graphics either, now did we? Or played runescape because it's ''so pretty''? While it's not the ugliest game out there, it's very noticeable that graphical wise, the game is unfinished and if you're a graphic whore, you'll be extremely annoyed at it. Hell, even I was a bit and usually graphics (considering the gameplay is nice, that is) don't bother me too much. But be warned, graphically you'll probably dislike it if you care about it a lot.\n\n\nLong story short; it's a game with a long, bloody history and while I totally understand people steering away from it, I encourage you to jump in with a friend and try it for a few hours. I am fairly confident you'll be put into an exciting situation that'll leave your heart racing, because despite all the hate, despite the fact the game is currently merely a fan made game, it brought me one of the best moments in gaming in general and not many games have been able to do that for me. If you want a PvP based game with looting on the side and farming zombies on the side, you might enjoy it. Just do not expect this perfect survival zombie shooter with PvP on the side, because that is NOT what it is. It's not for everyone.", "timestamp_created": 1479905800, "timestamp_updated": 1479905800, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 125, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75564807653427124", "comment_count": 16, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31241121": {"recommendationid": "31241121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055166916", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1482095224}, "language": "english", "review": "Formerly known as The War Z, this DayZ rip-off is little more than a scam.

My friend reccomended that i download it since it was free. So i did and we only played for like an hour that day. But then the two days later we added another player to our group and had a blast. We started ran out of the settlment and encountered Rifle Ridge, the first place we looted as a group. I decided to play it smart and watch the area from on top of the hills behind a rock, while my friends looted. Sure enough, a player spawned in just outside of the are my friends were looting, and i warned them that a player spawned in. This player did not have anything on him so at first we were going to play it friendly. BUT THEN, this player loots a shotgun and starts making his way towards my friends who were hiding behind a trailer. At this time I am shouting \"HE IS RUNNING UP TO YOU GUYS ON THE RIGHT SIDE\" My friends started to take aim as so did I. After he peeked the corner, we all shot at him, nearly unscathed. The adrenaline from that scenario got us going and we started to make out way into Campos City.\n\nwe were scared of this place at first because of all the zombies and the few gunshots we heard coming from the middle of the town. We looted a building or two before making out way ontop of the bridge to get an idea where these guys were shooting from. Once on top of the bridge, we see a group of two guys shooting at zombies. Without hesitation my friend starts shooting them, so we all joing in and did not take any of them out. They escaped and we waited several minutes before making our way down to continue looting. So we loot a few more buildings until we see another player by himself, shooting at zombies. so we try to sneak around him, but he see us so he opens fire. My friend is suppressed behind a wall and continues to fire at him. Seeing that our friend is in trouble, we try to maneuver around the building to suprise ambush him, but we fail because our friend who was getting shot at dies, then he almost immediately walks around the other side of the building and almost instantly kills my other friend. So at this point i am hiding and using third person to my advantage. I see that this player is out in the open and so i start lighting him up, getting a few hit markers, but then he starts jumping and almost instantly kills me as well. So at this point we got off not fully understanding what just happened. The next night. We have a lot worse luck. Almost every player we encountered was as good as the guy we fought that first night. These players were almost instantly killing us and we were not doing much damage to them. We again encountered a cqb fight were all three of us got picked off by one guy in a matter of 20 seconds or so. We were assuming that these players were hacking, but then i did a youtube search on tips and tricks of this game and quickly learned that there are a whole bunch of players who play like this. Quickscoping, killing others in a matter of 5 bullets. This is the cancer of this game. My friends and I are just looking to try this game out, but have to compete against these players who without a question have this game figured out. Even if we do end up killing these players, they often times will just instantly spawn back because they either have a membership or have enough money to instantly spawn them in all the time. So there is no winning against these players.\n\nSo that is where we stand with this game. 80% of the players we now encounter are veterans of this game and can easily win 70% of the gunfights against us simply because they always get headshots, as well as have enough money in the game to buy whatever they want in massive quantities, as well as instantly respawn all the time. If there were a way to separate these kinds of players from players like us, then we would without a doubt at least double the amount of hours we currently have invested in the game. It also wouldnt hurt to add some ambiance to the game, epsecially sounds.", "timestamp_created": 1481665052, "timestamp_updated": 1481665052, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.705560863018035889", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28132304": {"recommendationid": "28132304", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098833356", "num_games_owned": 140, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 95, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480652238}, "language": "english", "review": "this game sucks:(  \n\ni spent nearly two minutes on the loading sreen and it crashed after i playing for ten seconds.\n\nalso this game is not beginner-friendly", "timestamp_created": 1480652619, "timestamp_updated": 1480652619, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554506599903106689", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30667385": {"recommendationid": "30667385", "author": {"steamid": "76561198009900703", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 2434, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500474370}, "language": "english", "review": "*Shitty graphics, way too many weapons, you can melee zombies to death with your fists without getting damaged, no crafting system yet they have the key \"k\" designated to open the crafting menu.\n*Beginner Maps are a camp fest for people farming kills at spawn points, so no point in ever joining those servers.\n*Every 5 secs or less someone is getting FAC banned because they couldn't (find/ or pay for) the hack the some people are currently using.\n*North American servers are riddled with Russians and Slavics (so good luck trying to communicate with them)\n*Overall I 20/10 would uninstall it again", "timestamp_created": 1490184624, "timestamp_updated": 1490184624, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 10, "weighted_vote_score": "0.62897568941116333", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42698110": {"recommendationid": "42698110", "author": {"steamid": "76561197996268702", "num_games_owned": 132, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1416, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486871809}, "language": "english", "review": "This again?

Play like a villain= Have tons of fun that lasts a very short time.\n2. Play like a civillian= End up running into a random person that doesn't think the way you do.\n3. Sneak around the world just collecting items and only killing zombies= Everyone kills each other off, you end up alone in a server...literally.\n4. Try to make friends? Lol, there's other games/platforms/VR is actually entertaining for that.\n5. The PVP is hilarious, not in a good way but in a this feels like a 2004 online game hilarious kind of way. Actually, Socom might have been smoother.\n\nOverall, 3/10. 1 Point for the zombies, 2 for the general idea of a zombie survival game and 3 for being free and not charging.
