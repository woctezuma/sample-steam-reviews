The new version crashes on my Ubuntu. I waited until my trial expired before writing this. \n\nThe game company uses micro-transactions called em$ but starts you off with some gear (there's also earned gm$ but it's passive and limits purchasing scope). There's not a floating reticle, and by pressing Q then X you can move forward and pivot your head for 180 degrees. I tracked a deer - indicators are a bit more garish than I'd like, appearing as red arches above the ground where you use your equipped GPS/tracking device to analyze the more subtley glowing track marks. Animal calls are also geo-located. Shot the deer, where I discovered I could  have it mounted.\n\nThen I spent $5 for a bow and went to a different part of the range where I found myself tracking a grizzly gear. It saw me and gave chase. I launched the arrow in its face as it jumped at me to strike (Learned later, from a water buffalo, that you could get hurt). Missed the opportunity to mount the charging grizzly so I purchased a lodge, a long range rifle and scope for it. Aiming is weird with it. Aiming is clunky, in general, but I think that's also part of a gun's skill increase.\n\nI bought a lodge, a powerful rifle and a scope to go on it, then went for some moose and deer. You can pose the animals after mounting them.\n\nHaving paid only $15 so far, I'm only considering spending more on the extra capacity perk ($5) as well as a handgun.

THIS IS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION! It certainly does not turn the game completely around, but it's a start. I'll give credit where credit is due, but the problems that were always there still remain. The problem with this free rotation is that.. if your basic free ammo or gun can't hunt that specie.. then it's pretty much useless to you. You still have to buy the correct gun and the correct ammo to be allowed to hunt it. I'm not going to change any of my review beyond this part here, as I believe it's important to maintain records like this. Some info may be slightly out of date, however. Just keep that in mind.\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nIt's such a shame when you come across a fantastic game that's ruined by one of the worst payment models in any game you've ever seen. TheHunter is one of those games. What can you do for free, you ask? Well, you can hunt Mule Deer. That's it. That's all you can do. Shoot Mule Deer with one gun, one type of ammo. The default stuff you start with is all you get. It says you can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits, ah but the catch is you need to buy the correct gun to use in order to be allowed to hunt it. So, Rabbits aren't even free either.\n\nCan you earn enough to eventually buy another gun? Only one other gun is available for purchase using the game's earned currency (called gm$). Every other gun must be bought using real world money (called em$). And that's not all.\n\nWant the privilege to be able to hunt something else? You need to buy licenses. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they come in 1 day, 7 day, and 28 day variants. Yup, that's right. They expire. So you have to buy them multiple times to continue hunting what you want. Buy a 1 day license but then get called in to work? Congrats! You've just wasted your money! You CAN buy these with gm$, but the costs are so high that you'll be farming Mule Deer for weeks in order to finally be able to experience something else.\n\nOh but hold on. It's not like each kill you make earns you gm$. Hah! You wish! Nope. The only way to earn gm$ is to complete \"missions\" which range from tracking certain animals, spotting certain animals, and harvesting certain animals, among other similar tasks. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they typically reward only 100 gm$ for each mission, and your shotgun costs 6300 gm$, a typical 1 day license costs anywhere between 1800 - 2400 gm$. For ONE DAY, for ONE SPECIE. Let that sink in.\n\nWould I recommend this game? Based on its business model at the time of writing? NO WAY. Stay FAR away from this cash-grab game, unless you enjoy having them grab at your pockets the moment you try their game.\n\nAlso, NEVER EVER EVER DO ANY OF THE 3RD PARTY STUFF THEY ASK YOU TO DO. You can do things like surveys, downloads, watch videos, etc. to earn some em$ (that's right, paid currency). But most of these third party \"offers\" infect your computer with all sorts of malware, and most of them don't end up forking over the em$ at the end. You'll be turned away from most surveys because you \"aren't the target consumer\". For instance, when I answered that I was a white male on a survey, I was immediately declined and turned away, reward not given.\n\nIf the payment model is improved? I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. It's fun to play, all the shady practices considered. I just wish they had gone about their payment model better than this garbage. Oh well, someone else will come along and do it right eventually.", "timestamp_created": 1413894849, "timestamp_updated": 1485093438, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3189, "votes_funny": 232, "weighted_vote_score": "0.9492836594581604", "comment_count": 92, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47079520": {"recommendationid": "47079520", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035649497", "num_games_owned": 349, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8674, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543265689}, "language": "english", "review": "Graphics are amazing, animals are the most realistic I've ever seen in a game.

It should be, 'It's free to walk around but if you want to hunt sucessfully, you'll have to pay up'.\n\nFor example, the most expensive starter pack, with lots of good gear, is $49.99.  Sounds good, about the price of an A list game but one catch - your 'premium' subscription, or license to hunt all animals, expires after a year.

Here my honest review.\n\nSteam should ban company who advertise \"free to play\" game if you cannot do everything that a premium user can do.\nThe game let you earn gm$ by completing missions, and this currency cannot be converted in em$ which is a purchasable currency only.\n\nWhat they don't tell you is that after having fun doing the first missions, you need specific guns to advance, to earn gm$. I though yes, with the hard earned gm$ i can buy the gun I need to advance, then I can get more gm$.\nIn reality, all the guns you need are locked under em$, which is impossible to unlock with earned game currency.\n\nSo even if you buy a 1 year subscription, you still do not have access to all the weapons required either. the money you earn in game is only to buy some more basic ammunitions and that is. So if you are a player with a bad aim and miss your shot often, you will end up running out of bullet and unable to do the few left over missions that require you to shoot things with a specific weapon.\n\nNot counting all the weapons you need to finish every mission plus the minimum 3 month subscription required to access the map, one would require to spend a minimum of 150 usd to be able to play every missions the game have to offer, and to end up with am useless currency since what you can buy is entirely limited.\n\n\nThis is not a free to play game, this is just a demo that taunt you to buy a ton of microtransaction to have fun.\nThis is not even remotly close to a good mmo. \n\nI want to say, the game is fun, with an interesting concept, and indeed one of the best hunting simulator I have played to date, and cannot even be compared to call of the wild counterpart as this one feel way too easy and arcadish.\nBut this game is crippled with fake smiles and butter under lies. Which justify all the negative review it got.\nI am a fillipino, I work 40 hours per week to earn 130 usd per month, this game is asking me to spend 1 to 2 month of work to just play the fun part of it.\nOtherwise you are stuck with the noob gun, in a limited map, with nearly nothign to shot as all the fun animals are locked under a paywall.\n\nTerrible practice I do not agree with.\nNo wonder the forumscomplain about an increase amount of hackers, people want to play your game, but do not condome with your shady behavior.\nIf the subscription included all weapons to actually do all the missions, then I would agree, but this is not the case here.

It's not only stunningly beautiful, but the gameplay is exciting enough that 17 hours went by for me in the blink of an eye. It's a well-balanced gameplay experience that leaves you feeling very relaxed and almost meditative as you follow animal tracks over grassy plains and through serene forests, but there's always a base level of tension and excitement in trying to make sure that you aren't seen or heard by your would-be trophy in your pursuit. It's a lovely, cathartic experience.\n\nThere's just one problem.\n\nYou cannot buy this game outright. Instead, you're forced to buy an expensive \"hunter's license\" that only allows you to play for a limited amount of time, and even then you need to buy additional weapons and licenses if you want to be a more effective hunter or hunt a wider range of animals. It advertises itself as free to play, but make no mistake - you will absolutely need to shell out money in order to fully enjoy theHunter, and the clock starts ticking the moment you pay.\n\nYou'd save money by actually going out and hunting real animals, because at least in that scenario your gun isn't going to be revoked after three months.

(re-skins cost the same money too, not free) So you would be up for at least $40 USD OR MORE for that exact same deal in TheHunter Classic.\n\nThis is the main reason why I would recommend COTW over Classic as it stands now and have to give TheHunter Classic a thumbs down.", "timestamp_created": 1531217150, "timestamp_updated": 1531344745, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855061769485473633", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10325432": {"recommendationid": "10325432", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979593044", "num_games_owned": 972, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 24855, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529480929}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello everybody,\n\nI play this game since nearly the beginning, have seen the initial developer go bankrupt and the new developer take over. I have seen month with nothing happening in terms of developments and I have seen the last few month after multiplayer was released with new stuff released every few weeks.\n\nIf you love hunting simulations, theHunter for sure is the game you want. It's way more realistic then Cabela's games, it has pretty nice graphics and huge different hunting locations with many, many animals to hunt. Every species feels special and there has not been a really good hunting simulation since Deer Hunter 2005.\n\n- Pricing - \nThe downside: You need to invest a whole lot of money. To really enjoy the game you need a membership for about 5$ a month. No membership and you can only hunt very few species, need to buy ammo for all but the default rifle and can't create multiplayer games. Sure you can stick with some basic guns, but to take part in competitions and finish missions you need a whole lot of different guns. Each between 3 and 5$. Not to forget, there are tree stands, ground blinds and tents you would like to use sooner or later because there are very few fixed hunting towers on the maps and... yes, each of these items is another 4,50$ from your wallet.\n\nJust a few numbers for you:\nAll weapons with scopes (not caluclation different skins or \"premium\" skins)\nmore then 150$\n\nAll callers (no decoys, no consumables like scents):\nabout 20$\n\nDecoys for one full area for each species:\nabout 30$\n\nClothing depends on what you want, so I don't add a number to this, but each clothing set is about 5$... and you guess it: Some work better in different areas or against different species.\n\nStands and tents... lets say two of each for each reserve, you place them permanently, you don't want to pick them up after each hunt, so you can't really use the same two everywhere.\nmore then 200$\n\nSure, you are free to choose if you want this items, but to get everything out of the game you want this stuff. And more, every few weeks there is a new weapon, new cool cloth and your membership runs out every now and then. \n\n- Earn ingame money -\nThere are ways to earn ingame money: Win competitions, but without spending money you can only take part in very few competitions and so the chance is low (and the prize money gets you nowhere). The developers also have partnered with third-party pages who offer you some money for playing other online games, taking part in surveys or downloading and using different applications. The results are spam on your email address, malware and a lot of these offers simply don't reward you.\n\nThere is a different ingame currency you earn completing missions, but you can only use this \"money\" on consumables and you need a good bunch of weapons to finish most missions, so again: No way without spending money. There is no way to grind the gear inside the game.\n\nWithout spending money you stick with the .243 for the free Mule Deer and you can unlock the Single Shot Shotgun to hunt Cottontail Rabbits, but you need to buy the ammo for it. That works with earned money for some time, but sooner or later you will run out of missions to do without buying weapons or a membership for real money.\n\n- Bugs -\nThe game is full of bugs. I personally can't say there are gamebreakers, but animals getting stuck in trees, climbing trees, nearly all weapons stuck into your arm and broken reloading animations and other smaller and bigger bugs are around since a long time and often they return after a few patches. Gamebreaking bugs get fixed pretty fast but smaller bugs are often not relevant enough (and the fixes can't be sold like new weapons or cloth) so we will for sure see this bugs for some more time.\n\n- Community -\nJust have to add it now, after multiple insults from fanboys. This game has a small die hard community that are happy to have this game, due it's the only one of it's kind. This makes them accept and defend every action the developers take. Since this review I often got friend requests from some of these guys that have nothing better to do then to tell me I'm a hypocrit to play this game a lot and not remommending it in my review. That's what you get from the community if you are not a 100% fan and don't think it's okay to pay a small fortune for this game.\n\n- Conclusion -\nAs said, I'm into this game since years, I love it and I will keep playing it, but since about a year this game is all about money and everything ingame is pretty expensive. \nLike with this the pre-release review postet on Steam, my personal experience showed me, that the developers break promises and contracts, lie in some cases, solve things always to their best and only communicate public what makes them look good.\n\n- Tipp for beginners -\nIf you enjoyed the small free part, go to bit.ly/1oEMUr0 or google for \"theHunter 2014 box\" and purchase a key from the boxed edition of the game. For about 17 \u20ac you get 6 month membership (hunt all species, get free ammo for all guns) some starter weapons that allow you to hunt all species ethically and some additional gear. It's the best deal you can currently get as a beginner. This box is also available at Amazon and some other retailers if you want the box itself.\n\n- Update after some actions taken -\nToday the developers release a new .22 handgun and to make the game more realistic, changed the existing and wide spread .357 handgun and made it unethical for some species. What might be realistic is clearly forcing players to buy the new gun for about 4$.\n\nChanging already sold virtual items might be common but this change make this weapon pretty useless. Why? Because a lot of players have it. It's not a good weapon against larger animals and was pretty often used against birds, now the only animals it's good for are fox and coyote.\n\nThe new reserve released some time ago included the new \"feature\" of climbing walls... what simply is a bad mini game and asks you to buy a new consumable: Climbing gear. Some would argue that it's purchaseable with gm$ and you can take 75% back if you remove it, but it's again something that will eat up the earned gm$ from free players and make this game harder to play for free (besides, it's a shitty mechanic that has nothing to do with hunting).", "timestamp_created": 1401727924, "timestamp_updated": 1413135484, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3211, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.914047539234161377", "comment_count": 142, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12646264": {"recommendationid": "12646264", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025182379", "num_games_owned": 268, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 26, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414349022}, "language": "english", "review": "You have to pay to click on a bird with your gun.", "timestamp_created": 1414349864, "timestamp_updated": 1414349864, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2394, "votes_funny": 879, "weighted_vote_score": "0.893184125423431396", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12647562": {"recommendationid": "12647562", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127853429", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 38, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1414354042}, "language": "english", "review": "EDIT: People are actually defending this? Compare the amount of free content to the amount of content you have to pay for. It's unacceptable to make me pay money to access that much content in a free to play game.\n\nIt costs nothing to download, but I feel entitled to a refund.\n\nFirst of all, there was no tutorial for this. I was just thrown in, and expected to know how to hunt. I wandered aimlessly for a while, until I found some tracks. I followed them, and found some more tracks and some scat. There was so much scat, that I began to wonder if this animal was sick. I followed the trail for about one in game hour unril I saw it: a whitetail deer. Living in an area with a lot of rednecks, I was excited. Apparently deer are something you should want to hunt. I readied my rifle, and clicked the fire button. Nothing. Was the left mouse button not the fire button? The right mouse button readied the gun, so I figured the left would fire. Then a message popped up: \"You don't have the required license to hunt whitetail deer\". What? I just spent almost forty real minutes tracking this thing down, only to not be allowed to shoot it. This is a video game! I shouldn't need to buy licenses to hunt animals! And, since this was my first time playing, wouldn't it be nice to give me some licenses for free, so I can get a feel for the game before investing money in it (it's free to play, so I shouldn't have to pay to play it)! I quit the game, went to the store, and looked up how much licenses cost, only to see something that really pissed me off. The licenses are temporary! Are you fucking shitting me!?\n\nIf you don't buy the licenses, this is just \"Hiking Simulator\". I live in an area full of hiking trails. I can literally drive five minutes, and find a hiking trail. I do not have a gun, hunting equipment, or hunting licenses. I played this so I could hunt. After playing this, I might as well just get all of those things, because it would be something I could make memories out of, actually go outside, and do with my friends.\n\nValve, I am begging you, set standards for what can and cannot be free to play. I am asking that either this game be removed from Steam, or you make the developers add free content. I am not going to pay to play a game that is listed as \"free to play\". I will pay for extras, but only if the game is good.\n\nEDIT: Okay, so apparently I didn't notice that there is a tutorial. You people can stop commenting on it.\n\nSome people are saying \"well, it's a simulator\". Simulators don't have to be one hundred percent realistic.

Dont be fooled, this game says \"free to play\" but is actually one of the most expensive games that exists. You have to pay to shoot animals, and if you dont pay, you can shoot like 2. You also have to pay for all the guns, all the maps, all the clothes, all the items, and everything else. The only things available to purchase with the free play ingame currency, are licenses to hunt other animals, but you need ALOT of money. One mission, say, tracking a deer, takes at least 15 mins, and at most (usually) 2-4 hours. This 2-4 hour mission, tediously tracking down a deer, making SURE that you never, ever lose it, and that you get all the tracking markers, will get you around 100-150 gm$. The first license available to purchase, is SEVEN THOUSAND. Thats 140-210 GODDAMN HOURS, to be able to kill ONE MORE ANIMAL, that you will most likely, NEVER SEE, and if you do have the grace and patience to track this animal for another 2-3 hours, killing it would be hard, and JUST LIKE KILLING EVERY OTHER ANIMAL. One last thing, you have a weight limit on what you can carry out of camp, and there are tons of different ammo types. If you bring ammo meant for a deer (that wasnt labeled as \"Deer Bullets) and shoot ANYTHING else, it just does not count, at all. So you better be prepared to not find an animal, and not shoot it with the guns, license, and ammo that you dont have, all during time that would be better spent buying a real gun and shooting yourself in the testicles, all so that another human being never has the horrid chance to experience the \"free\" travesty that is, \"The Hunter\".   \n\n\n\n\n11/10. \nMasterpiece.\n\nAlso, credit for this review goes to my good freind, Wolf_Hunt, please, add him on steam. ;)", "timestamp_created": 1489294883, "timestamp_updated": 1489972357, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 130, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.840105891227722168", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36489805": {"recommendationid": "36489805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198185900310", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 4722, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465187712}, "language": "english", "review": "This game would have been great if it didn't have all this microtransaction garbage!

[u]Solution: Pay for callers, decoys, ground stands, tree stands, tripods, scent lures, feeders, bait.[/u]\n\nI'm surprised the developers don't ask money for every footstep you take into the game.\nIf you buy the $15 starter pack, you will be missing tons of guns and all other equipment that are simply needed to enjoy the game. But even if you spend $50 on the biggest starter pack, you still miss many equipment to hunt half the animals in the game and the weapon selection in the biggest package is rather sad (I wouldn't dare to say it was done deliberately to lure you into buying the more fun/better weapons later seperately wasting all the money you gave in the first place on guns that will be gathering dust).\n\n\nThis is the best executed hunter game ever if money grows on your back. We're talking at least \u20ac200 here to start enjoying [b]most of[/b] the full game. If you really want to hunt in luxury (it's a game, who wouldn't want to?) you'll start looking at a lot more money than that.\nThe game is easily 8/10. The amount of money you have to throw at the game to actually get to that 8/10 makes it a 1/10 at best.\n\nMy library hopefully shows I'm not one to be afraid to spend money on games. But these guys brought it to a level that I have never seen before. Congratulations on surpassing Korean MMO's EW.\n\n\n\nAddendum: [u]subscription[/u]\n\nAnd what are people paying subscription for?\nRetextured or new weapons? Because you have to pay to get those.\nNew animals? Because you have to buy licenses to hunt those.\nNew equipment for the new animals? Nope not that either because you have to pay for all the new callers and feeders and stands.\nMultiplayer? Well they did add MP afterwards but it can't be it since an MP game is hosted on our computer with our internet connection. And they didn't spend any effort on making a standalone server or adding any useful filters in the client browser to warrent anything special. That is if you are lucky enough the client browser is working without big lag and there are none of the many connection and disconnection issues.\nNew clothing? Again these cost money.\nNew maps? Well it must be maps then since there isn't anything else. So we're paying \u20ac35/year for the 4maps? they added in the last 5years. Those are some damn expensive maps!\n\nWe're not paying for continued development of the engine either.\n- View distance of 210m for weapons that can make accurate shots of 500m.\n- Trees that are literally square with highest ingame settings and the leafs are just flat green 'sheets'.\n- Game settings can only be adjusted outside of the game.\n- A fox and pheasant can just walk next to eachother because it's a fairytale land where all animals are big friends.\n- Mouse often feels laggy/jaggy however you want to call it. Many people have these small FPS drop problems and support just ignores it all.\n- The surface has the most annoying edges which makes it very awkward to crawl up to an animal and finding an angle where your gun gets enough depression.\n- Floating rocks, plants and trees everywhere you look on the map.\nI can go on further with a list of technical stupidities that were allready old tech 5years ago.", "timestamp_created": 1402483163, "timestamp_updated": 1402932883, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 246, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.911365032196044922", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36100988": {"recommendationid": "36100988", "author": {"steamid": "76561198131132894", "num_games_owned": 117, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 77, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1411124484}, "language": "english", "review": "Free to stalk, pay to hunt", "timestamp_created": 1509258546, "timestamp_updated": 1509258546, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 17, "weighted_vote_score": "0.830843865871429443", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47451402": {"recommendationid": "47451402", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047772153", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 277, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402075694}, "language": "english", "review": "It's worse than EA.\n- You want to shot animal?

But wait there's more! You still only have the two guns, one blind, one bottle of decent scent remover, and one call that only works for deer. So in other words expect to spend a ton of money on this game if you really want to play it. It's not my kind of game for that exact reason. Other than the paywalls this game is amazing.

I was bored one day, hopping from store page to store page of F2P games. All of them seeming like the same cash-grab garbage. So I stumble upon this game with it's Mostly Negative rating and assumed it was another cash-grab that needed to be purged.\n\nI downloaded it because I had been angered by the sheer amount of F2P cash grabs and decided I should throw a negative review at one of them.\n\nSo I played this game for a bit. I enjoyed the game-play quite a bit actually, perhaps the only good hunting sim out there at the moment. Played without paying any money for a little over a week and was ready to post a nice little negative review. However, I noticed people that posted positive reviews did not seem like blind fan-boys trying to avoid regretting the money they put into the game.\n\nNoticed the monthly subscription fee was among the smallest I had ever seen ($3.33 per month) and there are 3 Starter packs of different prices that offer some items along with a few months of membership. So I decided \"F*** it\" and bought the Wayfarer Starter Pack.\n\nI eventually came to the conclusion that this game is pretty damn good with a low price. If you want to play this game without spending a dime then run fast and run far.\n\nThe nice little \"Free-to-Play\" label next to Play Game isn't quite true. It should say \"$14.99 | Add to Cart\" and have \"Download Demo\" off to the side. \n\n\nSo for the game:\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Slowpaced relaxing game-play.\n\n+ Many species of animal that require different methods to hunt. (Many share different styles while some are unique)\n\n+ Rather low-entry fee compared to other \"Free-To-Play\" games.\n\n+ Decent community. Only encountered one troll in multiplayer who was quickly banned by the admin.\n\n+ There is an in-game currency earned by completing missions which can be used to buy consumables and temporary licenses for non-members.\n\n+ Still supported and updated by the developers. The developers have also relaxed some of the restrictions for non-members, such as adding a free animal rotation and making all the reserves free.\n\n+ An actual hunting simulator with tracking, flushing, etc. Instead of those low-budget shooting galleries that are on store shelves.\n\n+ A huge variety of equipment to allow constant play-ability and variation.\n\n+ Low cost membership grants access to all animals to hunt. You start with a 12 Gauge shotgun which can be used to hunt every animal except for Bison.\n\n+ There is a wonderful satisfaction in going for a group hunt then taking a group selfies in front of the kill.\n\n+ Nice sound design.\n\n+ Looks decent without causing FPS drops on my potato rig.\n\n+ Servers are stable most of the time.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- All equipment cost real money.\n\n- The \"Earn EMS\" system to gain money via methods other than directly paying does not work at all. I've taken enough surveys to earn over $100 in in-game currency and haven't received a dime.\n\n- Some animals are clearly added just to sell specific equipment. Bison require high-powered rifles, Black Bears are so skittish you almost always need a bait barrel and you cannot hunt ducks without buying a plethora of equipment to the point it feels like you purchased the \"Duck Hunting\" DLC. I personally haven't delved into most of the equipment yet so I cannot say if they're worth it or not yet.\n\n- Slow-paced gameplay is not for everyone.\n\n\nSo far I have spent $60 on this game. 15 of which went into the Wayfarer starter pack.\n\n\nOverall I recommend this game IF you are willing to put some money in it. If you're open to putting money in it I recommend getting it for free and seeing if it is for you.

Basic guns cost 5 dollars each and better ones well over 10.\n\nI don't mind the freemium models and actually spend a lot of cash on them lol.

To get any weapons, vehicles, pets or general enjoyment out of any part of the game after the 8 hour mark, you'll want to dish out somewhere between 49.99 and 105 euros, a frankly disgusting amount of money for a game which expects you to put an ungodly amount of time and effort into playing it.\n\nIf the payment model was very different, I might reconsider and recommend this beautifully crafted game, but as it stands, there's no game to speak of, closer to a rental service (It stands to mention that all hunting licenses are temporary, yet can be bought for real cash)", "timestamp_created": 1548369771, "timestamp_updated": 1548369848, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75117790699005127", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12287172": {"recommendationid": "12287172", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990778034", "num_games_owned": 301, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 233, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412155975}, "language": "english", "review": "110% pay to win.", "timestamp_created": 1411982107, "timestamp_updated": 1411982107, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 634, "votes_funny": 84, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820472538471221924", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45600919": {"recommendationid": "45600919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025432819", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1654, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541681341}, "language": "english", "review": "damn this is an expensive game.", "timestamp_created": 1541248469, "timestamp_updated": 1541248469, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 48, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.75988394021987915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13349674": {"recommendationid": "13349674", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045995561", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 39, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1418497125}, "language": "english", "review": "This is pay2play, not free.", "timestamp_created": 1418497156, "timestamp_updated": 1418497156, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 111, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.779057919979095459", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17056241": {"recommendationid": "17056241", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016206973", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 8325, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1539025345}, "language": "english", "review": "I've got about 140hrs in this game before it came to steam, which gives a total of ~200.\n\nI have also spent over 100$ for in-game items and licences. I'm guessing the only reason why I played it for so much was the fact, that there aren't any other decent hunting games.\n\nUnfortunatelly I really can't recommend this game to any new players.\n\nFirst of all, it gets more and more outdated because engine is getting old and has plenty of limitations.\n\nSecondly, the game is not Free to Play at all. Free accounts have access to 2 terrible guns, one bad scope and can only hunt a few animal species. You might be able to spot a boar but you won't be able to shoot it. Frustrating.\n\nYou have to buy licences to hunt all the animal species, and you can buy a licence for 3, 6 or 12 months. Yeah, it's a subscription fee, to play this game. And that's not everything.\nThen you learn about ethical weapons and the fact, that you need different weapons to hunt different species. Quickly you realise that you need to buy extra wepons and you can only do that with rl money.\nSo you spend extra 50$ on a proper rifle with good scope, a revolver, pistol holster, a bow, a backpack to carry all that stuff, maybe some camo clothing or a fancy binocs with rangefinder.\n\nNow you can start to hunt and it's quite fun. For a while...\nThen you get to the same point I did. You have killed every single animal species, long range, short range, revolver kills, bow kills. What can I do next?\n\nMisssions. Missions reward you with in-game currency that can be used to buy mostly consumable items. Honestly, there is nothing usefull that you can buy for that. Forget about buying guns  or even callers.\nIt gets worse. Many, many of the missions require you to use a specific weapon to complete them. You either spend rl money on some crappy gun (but I need it for a mission) or just ignore missions completly, since they are a waste of time.\n\nThen you move to competitions.\nSome competitions require specific guns but there should be plenty available where you can compete with any gun. To win a comp, usually you need to harvest a highest scoring animal. Most comps last 48hrs, some of them have limited attempts.\nWinning a comp gives you a trophy and some em$. That's the currency that is usually only purchaseable with rl money!\nYou might think that this is solution to all your problems. Win enough comps and be able to afford guns and items.\n\nSorry to disappoint you.\nUnless you are willing to spend countless hours, you won't win a thing. \nYou might get lucky and bag a winning animal on your first attempt, but chances for that are extremly low. From my experience: winning a comp that wasn't even very popular (not many players competing) required around 12 hours of playing (6hrs a day).\n\nYou will find out that most of the players, still playing this game, are massive no-lifers. MASSIVE.\nThere are competitions that require you to bag as many animals as possible in 48hrs period of time. Regularly you will have players that are willing to spend up to 40hrs online in that period (forget about sleeping etc) just to win a reward that is worth 1-2$.\nSoon you will realise that you're better off paying 5$ for a new gun that spending 100hrs doing competitions.\n\nEventually, there is no reason to keep playing this game. You got every animal, had some fun. Missions are pointless and a cashgrab attempt, competitions are for people with no jobs, who can pay 10+ hrs a day.", "timestamp_created": 1436943719, "timestamp_updated": 1436943719, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 40, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.752297937870025635", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12623987": {"recommendationid": "12623987", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101313896", "num_games_owned": 83, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1402858835}, "language": "english", "review": "Whats the point of making a game free to play if players are not allowed to enjoy full content.", "timestamp_created": 1414238370, "timestamp_updated": 1414238370, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 831, "votes_funny": 28, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797699332237243652", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12339410": {"recommendationid": "12339410", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963584378", "num_games_owned": 224, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 290, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527706664}, "language": "english", "review": "this hunting simulation is very good, provided that you are capable to immerse in the sneaked slow pace of the prowling tasks\n\nit is perfect with 3D vision\n\nI have played an enjoying one-year/50\u20ac  \"tour of duty\" (about 170 hours) when the game wasn't yet on Steam, yet I discover that the pricing policy is the same: there is to periodically pay for almost everything, just like it were a real hunt (I don't know you, but I cannot roast and eat digital boars)\n\nwill the publisher ever sort something out from all these negative feedbacks and transform this \"tax\" in a normal basegame+DLCs?", "timestamp_created": 1412353336, "timestamp_updated": 1412716089, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 109, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.667742371559143066", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34679554": {"recommendationid": "34679554", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058145873", "num_games_owned": 260, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 1449, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1520730590}, "language": "english", "review": "Find animal\nYou dont have a licence!\nFind animal\nYou dont have a licence!\nFind animal\nWrong ammo!\nPay to fucking play", "timestamp_created": 1504341268, "timestamp_updated": 1504341268, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.800068557262420654", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41389438": {"recommendationid": "41389438", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118036816", "num_games_owned": 91, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 897, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1523317440}, "language": "english", "review": "*Jumps into game*\n\nOk lets see!

I have never really been interested in hunting, but  I was pleasantly surprised with how fun and relaxing it was for the first few hours. After I finally hunted down my first deer and killed it, I was really excited to go back to the store and see would I could purchase with the money I recieved from my hunt. It was then that I realized this is absolutely not a \"free to play\" game.\n\n I understand that the developer has to make money, and I have no problem with them making the free to play members work hard for what they get, but it is literally impossible for free to play players to progress. The only thing you can really afford without paying is ammo, and it still takes a while to get the money for it. You don't even get money for harvesting your prey. You have to complete missions (which by the way, most require items that you have to buy in order to complete) to get the in game currency and the prices for the items that you are allowed to purchase with in game currency are astronomical. All of the weapons have to be purchased with real money. All outfits must be purchased with real money. The licenses' are available through in game currency, but it will take you a year of playing to get a 7 day license for one animal. The worst part is that the items in this game aren't even cheap. Almost everything is $3.00 and up, and that money will add up considering you have to buy basically each individual item (with the exception of some bundle packs).\n\nMost free to play games offer premium and free to play. Usually, premium makes it a little easier to progress and adds more content to premium members. Not in this game. \"Free to play\" in this game is literally just a demo. You have to pay to play if you want to do anything other than hunt mule deer, keep the same weapon, stay on the same hunting ground, make your own game, and constantly get kicked from games after doing nothing wrong. So basically.. you have to pay if you want to do anything fun, and that's why I got this game to start. I would not recommend getting this game unless you plan on spending loads of money.\n\nI also want to add a note to the developers. People will still spend money on this game if you make it more friendly towards free to play players. You are severely limiting the crowd of people playing your game by making it \"pay to play\". I know a bunch of people that have never had the slightest interest in hunting that would love to play this game. If you open up the game more, more people will come, and more people will be willing to support you and pay money. However, as of right now, I would not support this game because you have mislead me and many others that downloaded this game believing it was \"free to play\".\n\nMy review will change if the developers ever decide to remove the extreme restraints that they have placed on the players. If nothing changes, they need to list this as \"demo\" and put a price tag on the actual game, because the store page is very misleading.", "timestamp_created": 1403372636, "timestamp_updated": 1403375258, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750385880470275879", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42607139": {"recommendationid": "42607139", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115701281", "num_games_owned": 61, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469313842}, "language": "english", "review": "pay to play\npay to win\npay to breathe\nthe only free thing is this reveiw\nif you want a game buy the call of the wild one", "timestamp_created": 1528564233, "timestamp_updated": 1528564233, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.745065212249755859", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "36062741": {"recommendationid": "36062741", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099818650", "num_games_owned": 82, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 85, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412816208}, "language": "english", "review": "\"free\"", "timestamp_created": 1509157925, "timestamp_updated": 1509157925, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744258403778076172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33078521": {"recommendationid": "33078521", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150040124", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1498997233}, "language": "english", "review": "Its pay to play.", "timestamp_created": 1498906488, "timestamp_updated": 1498906488, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 95, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778811216354370117", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12524433": {"recommendationid": "12524433", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002203301", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 30, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413553164}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi everyone!

I was scared :p But then i got used to it its actually pretty convinient thing. \nThen i pressed *HUNT* and spawned in some kind of camp. Graphics in this game are nice. The movement is awful because when i pressed *c* button to sprint it was a fucking walking speed  -_- But its okay too. Then i saw my first animal! It was a deer i guess..) I wanted to shoot it but didn`t want to miss so tried to get closer and spooked it away. I was a bit sad about this but i had even more enthusiasm.. Right after that i saw a rabbit and shoot it. IT WAS AWESOME!!! But i didn`t know what to do with the body. Like how to kinda claim it.. And so i went on.I found deer traces and tracked it down my GPS. After 30 minutes of walking ( actually it was nice cause the world detalised beautifully) i found My dear deer drinking water from the river. That time i was really carefull and started crouching from 2 km long)) And i crouched for my fuckin entire life but it was nothing because i enjoyed it.

I LOOKED WHERE CAN I GET LICENSE AND SAW THAT IT WAS FUCKIN 100000$$$$ \nThis how my story ends. Fuck this game. It`s better be paid then be free but BASED ON THE FUCKIN DONATE!!\nSo decide.

These micro transactions are thrown upon you at almost every second of this game. Want to play with a friend? Nope you have to pay! Want to use a bunch of cool weapons? Nope you have to pay! Can I at least hunt and kill alot of animail's? Nope! Without membership you can only kill and select amount of animals. \n\nEven if the shady transactions and free to play model were not present it doesnt get rid of the fact that theHunter never stops being a boring and extremely glitchy game. Actully shooting an animal is near impossible due to the very laggy movement. I found myself having a hell of a lot more fun using the goddamn brick breaker app on the hunters phone in game than actully hunting, which is never a good sign. Hunting games can be fun and interesting but theHunter with lack of a better work screwed everything up and created a pile of shit which is a disgrace to good games trying to get on steam these days.\n\n-AUS ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)", "timestamp_created": 1422490602, "timestamp_updated": 1436882452, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 163, "votes_funny": 35, "weighted_vote_score": "0.8126412034034729", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18398206": {"recommendationid": "18398206", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044372277", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 52, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1442337123}, "language": "english", "review": "Would rather buy winrar", "timestamp_created": 1444409946, "timestamp_updated": 1444409946, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1449, "votes_funny": 3315, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828566133975982666", "comment_count": 36, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33047566": {"recommendationid": "33047566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198125930660", "num_games_owned": 78, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 42, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489844331}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]This game only wants your money, hey made it free to attract you into downloading it and buying $50 worth of just a liscence.

Be careful, dont invest money into this game as one false accusation will get you banned and everything will be lost.  All your time and money will be gone.  So that begs the  question why dump money and time into something that clearly doesnt resemble true hunting experience but more of an arcade style shooter?  Dont know why i did and you should not either.  I found the game to be flawed both in game play and in actual practice of hunting.  Games are Games but you have people thinking this is really how it is to hunt.  The real name  for this game should be The Shooter not The Hunter.  Hunting consumes many hours of prep and scouting and then you are not gaurenteed anything.  this game gives you high rewards and for no investment of anything.  So take what you will from this Just trying to save you the hassel when you could be playing other far better put together and updated games than this one.  \n\nBest Regards", "timestamp_created": 1519215819, "timestamp_updated": 1519215819, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 49, "votes_funny": 9, "weighted_vote_score": "0.783624410629272461", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27962754": {"recommendationid": "27962754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100256779", "num_games_owned": 45, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 59, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1480349035}, "language": "english", "review": "i came into this expecting to write a really negative review because this game is marketed as free, without the DLC its basically a demo. yet, a really enjoyable demo.\n\nto the people who say this game is slow pace: well ofcourse it is its a hunting game genius.\nto the people who say there are almost no animals: in my first 30 minutes i had to decide between 3 different animals to track, a rabbit, a deer and a cayote. first i went after the rabbit since that was the only animal i had seen myself.\n\nthis game almost geniunely makes you feel like you are outside, because face it, thats the closest thing to outside (or the route from your house to the closest grocery shop, the few times you dont order pizza) you will ever see. if you were to turn a fan on so you can also enjoy the wind this will get an immersion rating of 9.9/10.\n\ni see myself playing this semi-often, its super relaxing and yet very entertaining.\n\nbut!\nthere are a noticable amount of really small yet obvious bugs that you cant help but notice, and question why the dev hasnt fixed these yet? does he not play the game himself? and ofcourse the DLC drama this game has, to be fair its still pretty entertaining but i can see it getting old without the DLC's. and i dont want to spend 15$-50$ for a game marketed as free.\n\ni would normally say \"but hey, its free, play it yourself\" but no, this game requires an account first of all and secondly the download is massive for a 'free' game. if youve got the time and the space on your computer and you like slow pace games sure, try it. but in most other situations contemplate if youre willing to go through possible trouble and annoyance for a hunting sim (a good one might i add).", "timestamp_created": 1480348612, "timestamp_updated": 1480348670, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685892343521118164", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23361593": {"recommendationid": "23361593", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078863386", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 108, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416336390}, "language": "english", "review": "You must pay to buy things, you need pass to walk properly, you need pass to breathe, you need pass for pause menu, you need pass for buying passes, you need pass for carrying a gun, you need pass for downloading this game, you need pass for peeing, you need pass for shitting, you need pass for reading this, you need pass for quit game button, you need pass for running the game, you need pass for shooting birds, you need pass for sounds, you need pass for music, you need pass for buying coins, YOU NEED PASS FOR UNINSTALLING THE GAME.\n\nwell I don't recommend but you still have to buy a pass for liking this review :P\nEven the developer answered us :)", "timestamp_created": 1464962812, "timestamp_updated": 1480013394, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 401, "votes_funny": 644, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836487412452697754", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15037731": {"recommendationid": "15037731", "author": {"steamid": "76561198088670839", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 83, "playtime_forever": 859, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417107887}, "language": "english", "review": "if this game was a disk, I would use it for skeet shooting", "timestamp_created": 1427224703, "timestamp_updated": 1427224703, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 178, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835914909839630127", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18899114": {"recommendationid": "18899114", "author": {"steamid": "76561198087293237", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1405657215}, "language": "english", "review": "Day 1: After a long while of walking, i find a deer and kill it, I needed a license to do that.\nDay 2: I found a bird, i killed it.

I'm going to write a review.. This is my first review and probably my last because if I write a review, trust me I'm pissed off as hell! And hell, am I pissed of now!\n\nAs you can see I played 700+ hours in this game and long story short, i DO NOT RECOMMEND this game to anyone. Believe me the game is worth paying money for, it\u2019s WORTH IT\u2019S MONTHLY prescription and please if you are here to play the game for free just turn around the way you came, this is not for you. It is only free to play as a DEMO, you get extremely limited options and playability. If you want to put money in this game it is definitely worth it IF NOT FOR;\n\n1)\tThe lack of multiplayer compatibility; (300 servers and only 5 you can connect to due to \u201ccould not connect to host\u201d, \u201chost has quit the game\u201d(server still in server list 30 mins after the host quit the game already),  \u201clost connection to host\u201d, server of my buddy up and running (TeamSpeak confirmed) and not in server list for about 45 mins, \u201cerror 16005\u201d \u201cI GOT IT\u201d, \u201cerror 404 developer\u2019s f*cks not found\u201d\n2)\tAbundant bugs (which NEVER EVER GET FIXED) and I\u2019m not talking about the bugs previously discussed as connection bugs, I\u2019m talking about bugs of getting stuck in scenery, floating ducks that stay stuck in the air (due to connection error again though), animals stuck behind trees and rocks, animals that have died on player side but not harvestable because of server misalignment,\u2026,.., and the list keeps going and going\n3)\tThe developers don\u2019t give a f*ck *(this is the most important part for my experience); They keep hiring new people with great new ideas about a new species like the \u201cpolar bear\u201d (which you\u2019re not allowed to f*cking shoot!, PUT YOUR DEVELOPING TIME IN SOMETHING USEFULL YOU IDIOT DEVELOPERS), persistent problems with connections which have been an issue and have been addressed numerous times by the community but have been left aside because getting new weapons and new animals is more profitable, priority is giving above all to getting a new skin on a new weapon which costs you another 5$ because the colour has changed on the weapon or because the colour of the animals has changed.\n4)\tThe game is not even near a complete stage, with its developers building on a broken game and making it more unplayable than it already is. They keep adding sh*t without fixing previous errors and by doing so they make the implementation of anything REALY worth it get drowned by the everlasting errors and bugs that follow it. The implementation of something good is followed by weeks, if not months, of issues resolving from this add-on and by getting the public back to the game the implement something new, which starts the hole sh*t train from the beginning.\n\nIf you have not already turned around and decided not to look at this game, I tell you again, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME OR PUT MONEY IN TO IT IN IT\u2019S CURRENT STATE. I don\u2019t think this current state is going to change to anything good in the foreseeable future as the developers just don\u2019t give a f*ck or are trying but are so inexperienced that my 6yo niece can make a better running game. This game has potential but it should have been a Steam GreenLight game and not a finished one and the enormous ego that makes the developers not think about gameplay but all about money made me vote this game as DO NOT RECOMMEND. \n\nI hope to god that the developers are reading my review and start working on the issues that need to be fixed to make this game worth it. If they are not, be wary of my next review, as I will be even more pissed off as I keep playing this game in the hope it becomes something it should be.\n\n(PS: this review was 16 pages long but I removed a lot of the swearing, reducing it to 2.
