Some reviews I think just focus directly on the wrong aspects of the game, mostly the time powers, the part that draws you in and makes the story but not the reason why this game hits so many people emotionally.\n\nThe soundtrack was amazing, the story was consistent and kept the kind of continuity you don't find in other stories, despite others saying they couldn't follow it(it was back and forth a lot, but that made it great in my opinion). But the real reason this game is great is because it's a game.\n\nIf Life is Strange was a movie, I think it would hit, but more like a soft thump that makes you feel bad, but it would be too short, feel edgy, and it wouldn't have the chokehold on your heartstrings that the game has. In Life is Strange... you're attached, you are Max Caulfield, and this is happening to you. You decide what to do, and for a game that lets you go back in time, it really shows how fragile choices in life are and what they can mean. And when you can just fix everything all of the time... when you can't, it becomes that much worse. You feel so out of control, you just want to rip your eyes out and cry at the same time.\n\nI won't spoil too much, but there is a moment when you lose your powers for a moment. And in that moment, you have to do something very important. Personally, I failed. I failed and I almost cried, not in the moment but after the fact, because I realized after everything that happened, this wasn't something I could change. In another moment, you're trapped. You can't move, and all you can do is keep going back and trying to do what few options you have. And you just keep going back, not just a few seconds, but all the way back, and you think you can change it, but things get convoluted and hard to follow, and every single tiny action you do can change everything. And they do.\n\nLife is Strange isn't about any single story, it's about Arcadia Bay, and yes, there's a focus on Max Caulfield and Chloe Price, but you also care about the side characters in some way, because they aren't empty husks. They're fleshed out people with feelings, and are deeper than face value. This is a long game, and if you take the time to explore everything, you will see a side that no movie or even book could ever show. Life is Strange capitalized on everything it had, and it did it well. It turned what started as an edgy teen high school story into something not just mature, but something that can stand alone as genre defining. From now on, when I think back to the best drama I've ever watched, it won't be a movie, it will be this.", "timestamp_created": 1550672238, "timestamp_updated": 1550676755, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.590517222881317139", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48791760": {"recommendationid": "48791760", "author": {"steamid": "76561198130201476", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 80, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1470937649}, "language": "english", "review": "Perfect Story and Game.I have no words to describe how I feel about this game.", "timestamp_created": 1549432974, "timestamp_updated": 1549432974, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.538461506366729736", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48908078": {"recommendationid": "48908078", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091701402", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1065, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1, "last_played": 1550891171}, "language": "english", "review": "I got a plant and name her Lisa.

is a spoiler). The 5-five story explores themes of choice and consequence, moral decision, and features several key moments where Max's actions will influence the game as a whole. Life is Strange is one of my favourite games for these reasons; I enjoy a game where I can see the impact of player choice coming into effect, and emotional (manipulation) storytelling - done right in this instance - is always excellent.\n\nI highly recommend Life is Strange to everyone who hasn't experienced an interactive video game.

Such as love, friendship, suicide...\nThe game is a bit hated because people say it has too many LGBT things but I dont give two fucks what they say. We can all choose our own sexuality. We can all rule our lives.\n\nFreedom has no price, nobody should take it for granted if they have it, it has so much fucking value, I never had it when I was a kid so thats why I have a part of some defects the characters in the game already have.\n\nIt also teaches us about losing someone we loved. Like Chloe lost her father and Rachel. Or how Max sacrifices Chloe and loses her. (In the game when I first played it chose Chloe over Arcadia bay obviously)\n\nWe all have such small, and sad lives. Can't we just...accept our fate and start socializing?-(still hard for me to do but here goes nothing) Let's make other people's life better!\n\nI could spend so much talking about how much I love the game. How much I couldve had the same style exactly like Chloes when I was a teenager, but its never too late to dye your hair blue right ? How much I admire and envy the relationship between Chloe and Max, I feel bad sometimes for not having a Max in my life but at the end of the day, who gives a shit.\n\nAnyways, I love that game, and I always fucking will.

I have never cried so much over a video game, the choices you are forced to make.....they make you take a step back and think \"Could I make these kind of choices if I had to?\" Life is Strange will play on every emotion you have, you will cry, you will be furious, you will say out loud \"what the fuck?\" I have never played a game so complex, that even the simplest of decisions will affect the final outcome. I bought this on sale, and I feel like I ripped the developers off cause I didn't pay full price. The art style, the music, the emotions, the life choices, Life is Strange is easily one of the greatest experiences in video game, and storyboard writing ever created. Just under 13 hours on my first play through, and I was never board for a second, I'm gonna need a day or two to rest my emotions after this, but I will be going back many times to see how my decisions affect the final outcome.

The concept of this game is simple but if the company uses this concept right, they could create a masterpiece. But when they were creating this game, they probably wrote the story when they were taking a late night shit in the bathroom.\n\nThe story starts actually pretty good. The concept is also fine in paper but in action, the story is horrible.\n\nHow could you screw up a concept, which is based on a girl who can rewind the time to change her life, other people's lives, and also the fate of a town which will be destroyed by a storm in the future? This game is a teenager game and this game is for the people who doesn't know (and probably will never know if they keep playing these overrated games) what a good story should be. The story is shit, choices does not even matter except the few last decisions at the end, which is stupid for a FUCKING CHOICES MATTER ADVENTURE GAME! You can only rarely emphaty with characters.\n\nThis game is overrated as fuck, most of the gamers are thinking that this game is better than any Telltale games.

What really frustrated me was the ignorance and bigotry of the writing staff showing in the story. Characters in the story who claim to value science and are purportedly good at it are constantly making grand and unreasonable assumptions regarding phenomena they have very little information about, and in several instances making claims based on faith alone. The bigotry is very apparent in the story, considering the trajectories of characters based on their religious beliefs. The only expressed atheist is a complete psychopath who is criticized by the protagonist for lacking religious belief, the most religious character in the story is a completely innocent victim who was mercilessly mocked for her beliefs and whom the protagonist claims doesn't push beliefs on others. Faith is a central theme throughout the plot, and the writers are constantly positively reinforcing faith-based characters and negatively reinforcing those who lack them, even by characters who are supposed to represent the scientists of the story. This game had potential to be really good if the writers weren't so obviously bigoted and ignorant of the basic elements of the scientific process.", "timestamp_created": 1550830488, "timestamp_updated": 1550830488, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.432334065437316895", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32299639": {"recommendationid": "32299639", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262158864", "num_games_owned": 229, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 2163, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521907859}, "language": "english", "review": "I love this game.

I was delighted. The Bundle had several games, such as Murdered: Soul Suspect, The Last Remnant, 3 Tomb Raiders, and the first episode for this game called Life is Strange.\nNot gonna lie I've been trying to get my hands on this game for a while but I always ended up buying other games (oh, I wish I could go back in time to buy Life is Strange, instead of those games).\n\n[u]December 24, 2015[/u]\nOh, What the hell!? I'm gonna buy the rest of the episodes for Life is Strange. I don't care, it's Christmas Eve. It's a little gift from me to myself. I can't wait for the holidays to pass so I can finally start to play this game.\n\n[u]December 25, 2015[/u]\nAlright, the time has come. The time to start this epic journey, hopefully, alongside with Max and Chloe.\nIt's been so long since I first saw this game on the store, and yet I don't really know what to expect from this game. Like at all. I don't know what the story is about. Time to play it, finally!\n\n[u]December 26, 2015[/u]\nToday I played the first and the second episode of Life is Strange, and oh man, now I really wish I would have bought this game earlier, instead of all those other games. The story just started and I already feel such a strong connection to the characters. I don't think that any other game made me feel like this. Better continue this story, I'm so intrigued about what's gonna happen next. Can't wait to play it.\nP.S.: Always go with Eggs and Bacon!\n\n[u]December 27, 2015[/u]\nHoly Crap.. This game is getting tougher and tougher, emotionally speaking. What the hell is going on?\nToday I only could finish the 3rd Episode, and I can ensure you this is getting darker and darker.\nI'm at the point where the decisions are getting harder and they start to have a great weight on the story.\nAlthough I know Max can fix this situation, that ending just left me heartbroken.\nI haven't even finished the game yet and I can't stop thinking about it. Goddamn it.\n\n[u]December 28, 2015[/u]\nI lacked courage and strenght to go through these last episodes, call me whatever you want, but this game took a toll on me. When I finally did it, I can say that I have never felt like this before. I think the correct word is desolated, yeah, I feel desolated. \nThe story is absolutely beautiful, it has many twists, and the characters are so well developed that you can easily create special bonds with almost everyone. Graphically the game is beautiful as well, take your time to appreciate the little details.\nObviously I will not spoil you, but be aware, this game has no good ending. It has a bad ending and a worse ending.\nI took the ending, that I consider to be the bad ending (morally speaking), and it doesn't make me feel that bad.\nAfterall, friends are for life, right?\n\n[u]December 30, 2015[/u]\nTwo days have passed since I finished the game, and I still can't stop thinking about it.\nSometimes I find myself reading Max's diary, and looking at screenshots and artwork of the game. \nI have to play it a second time to complete it, but it's still to soon, I have to recover first. I can't make Max go through all that again.\nI had no idea that a game could make such impact on a person. This is one of my favorite games and I recommend everyone to play it.

Even if this review seems cringy, I really don't care. I can see myself replaying this game when the shock of my first run through wears off. \n\nThis game is a masterly written narrative which allows you to get really invested in each and every character you come across. A character you initially don't like, you can feel really sorry for, a character you love, you can hate. There is no black and white when it comes to this game, there is only a murky grey where each and every character lives. \n\nTruly, each and every choice you make comes back at a later date. Even if you think your choices are morally right, it doesn't make you right, and to write that into a game takes incredible skill and craftmanship. Each of your decisions matter and, even though you can't change what you choose, you'll always find yourself second guessing yourself and the choices you've made. This brings into perspective the choices you make in real life and how the decisions you make there might have lasting repocussions. \n\n\nI honestly cannot recommend this game more if you like a good narrative with relatable settings and characters. The former are places that are nothing special, other than the dream sequences ect, and you can clearly see yourself in each place. The characters you meet are people that you can quite easily meet every day, each has their own motives, ambitions and personality. It brings into perspective just how much you can judge people without clearly thinking.\n\nFinally, there's the music and sounds. The music in this game is very similar to the music that I listen to daily, and each song comes on in places that I listen to music on a daily basis. The music in this game was added to my playlist without a second thought, namely Spanish Sahara and Obstacles. Alongisde the masterful music, there's the ambient sounds which are so delecately placed to make the enviroments seem more real. Gust of wind ect make you truly feel like you're in the environment Max is in. To be able to do this is, again, masterful and really brings into perspective just how much music can affect a game, or a person, each and every day. \n\nThe overall theme of my review is perspective, and the main thing that has changed for me whilst playing this game is my perspective on numerous things. However, the most obvious area of perspective that has changed for me is my perspective on what makes a game narrative great. \n\n\nTL;DR - Did reverse Last of Us as my final choice, was shocked.

Damn. I instantly fell in Love with it and played every Episode and each per sit. 5 Sessions \u00e1 2-3,5 Hours. Worth it!! [/h1]\n\nThis game is a masterpiece. At the beginning, I thought it was just a kind of teen drama, based on the importance of friendship and on the story of a typical geek bullied at school. But it goes over.\n\nFirst of all the less interesting part, the graphics, they are quite good but similar to those of a PS3 game, even though they improve a little in the last chapters. The Lip-Sync sometimes just stops working and aren't even moving even tho they're talking.\n\nBut the story is absolutely captivating and the plot depends highly on your choices during the whole game.\nIt's not just the story of a shy teenager who's attending a new school trying to make new friendships, there is a big mystery to solve about a disappeared girl and other important decisions to make, as the protagonist finds out to have a strong power: she can rewind time. \n\n[h1] YOU [/h1]  can choose when rewinding time, changing your decisions, your actions, your words. It makes the game more interesting and in the end there are just two crucial choices to take which really makes you feel bad. I appreciate the realistic dialogues, situations and troubles linked to her supernatural power.\n\nI like the story because since the beginning it makes you feel anxious and you want always to know how it will end. I absolutely love also the theme songs during the game, especially in the chapters finals.\nThe gameplay, being an interactive drama, is quite basic, you just have to walk and press buttons when required. You definitely put yourself in the main character's shoes and this is what I loved the most in this amazing game, I think it is a masterpiece.\n\nIf you're in need of a Story-driven Movie / Game / Walking Simulator where choices matter - feel free to get it. It gets traded mostly for a few dollars MAX.\n\nif you're in need of a FPS and a like GTA / Metro or whatever... you wont find you luck here.

It is a hard feeling to deal with. The characters feel very real. You come to know many of them, and love them almost like real friends. Then the game is over, and those characters are gone. This causes a hurt inside you. Very much like losing dear friends, because there is no continuation for these characters.\n\nThis game is VERY emotional and deals with some very dark, and unfortunately very real things in our world. If you feel for other people, and nature, and the things only humans can cause, whether they are good or bad, this game might make you feel very sad at times, because it puts these things right in your face.\n\nI cried so many times going through this game. I'm a pretty emotional person, but I think these feelings are totally intentional, and so I think the people who made this game did a damn good job. I wish to explore that world and those characters forever, because they seem that real. But, you can't. Much like the themes in this game about how little control we all have over time and events we can't foresee, this game ends and I have to find a way to move on.\n\nThe world in this game is pretty to look at. The graphics aren't amazing, but they are done in an artistic way that reminds me of watercolors or something. The gameplay is very similar to Telltale Games style, in that it is mostly walking around areas interacting with a limited number of objects, and talking to other characters. The real point of the game is the storytelling, and they do SUCH a good job in this one, as I've been over and over here.\n\nI would recommend that if you do play it, take it slow, take long breaks if you need them. I took almost a year break and then several week breaks in between some parts, and it is still messing with me that I can't see anything more from these characters. Only replay the game again.

It feels incredibly sad to say \"Good Bye\" to this game. While playing I had a chance to get to know every in game character, especially Max and Chloe. They've become like my new friends, we've been through so much together, and realizing that it's over now, it's hella tough. \n   I've seen a lot of great games before, but never did a game make me feel SO connected to its characters. And every time you need to make a choice, you start seeing everything you've been through before and thinking how to make things even better. But I think the most important thing here is not to overthink (I mean not to try to Google what consequences your choice is going to have because it kills all the excitement of not knowing). Just do what feels right and what your heart tells you even if you might be wrong. I guess that's the lesson I learned in here. \n   Other important things that make Life Is Strange my favorite game: The developers paid attention to the smallest details, some of them you don't even notice playing for the first time, but the fact that they're there makes me appreciate it even more. The graphics is hella amazing, you just have to see it for yourself :) The plot and the music complement each other in subtle ways, and I can guarantee you'll have at least several of the soundtracks in your favorites playlist ;) \n   The game's definitely worth its money and even more. I wish I'd be able to forget everything that happened in the game and start playing it from the very beginning, so I'd be able to feel everything with the same intensity I did during my first playthrough. But I'll definitely come back to it after some time just to do it all over again. \n   Dear Developers, THANK YOU so much for Life Is Strange.

After so much time, I finally dived into the universe of Life is Strange. After all the praise I\u2019ve seen, and the huge fandom that seems to be everywhere (which is hella understandable), I finally have played Life is Strange. Life is Strange is an episodic story-driven adventure which relies in your decisions to change certain story elements as you progress. This is a formula already known by Telltale games, but completely revamped and explored in a completely different, interesting way.\n[b][i]Are you cereal?[/i][/b]\n\nYou play as Maxine Caulfield, a photography nerd and not-so-popular student of Blackwell Academy. Blackwell is your stereotypical school portrayed in the movies and videogames, there\u2019s the jockeys, the nerds, the cheerleaders and the usual bullying here and there. It all seems like a normal day, until our main character finds out she can manipulate time! This is how the game takes a completely different approach on decisions. You can always rewind and see what happens if you pick another line, or another action, giving you the opportunity to see most of the outcomes.\n[b][i]I dare you to kiss me now.[/i][/b]\n\nIf you\u2019re not aware, Life is Strange is split into five episodes, each one of them carries the decisions you have made on the previous chapters. The first episode is the introduction to how the game plays. It shows the decision and time manipulation mechanics so you familiarize yourself with the controls. It also introduces the set of characters in the Life is Strange universe. By the end of the episode we meet Chloe Price, a so long forgotten friend of Max Caulfield. Your adventure only really begins when you step into that van. Since this is the first episode, it is by far the most light hearted in the saga. From here on there\u2019s no way back, the roller coaster ain\u2019t going back, except if you\u2019re Mad Max and can rewind time. It has been YEARS since I\u2019ve experienced so many emotions with a game, I think the last one that hit me this bad was Metal Gear Solid 4.\n[b][i]You finally came back to me this week, and... you did nothing but show me your love and friendship.[/i][/b]\n\nThe voice acting in some sections is absolutely superb in every way. There\u2019s one part that only the voice acting itself and the spoken lines are enough to sadden me into oblivion, this happens on the fourth episode, in the Junkyard. It\u2019s a completely heartbreaking scene and really well done. Fact is, this game is not perfect in some aspects, but when you sacrifice certain aspects and polish the rest, that\u2019s enough for me to overlook the flaws. As an example, the lip sync is not really good, but it doesn\u2019t matter at all, when the voice acting is just so good and emotional.\n[b][i]What kind of world does this?[/i][/b]\n\nThe amount of references in this game really give it a unique feel and approach. It\u2019s like Dontnod just felt like they had to squish a reference everywhere they could, and that\u2019s amazing in my point of view. It makes the game more accessible and it becomes more familiar and easier to relate to. Maybe this is why we end up getting too emotionally obsessed with this game when it really turns for the worst.\n[b][i]I hate that word\u2026 no offense.[/i][/b]\n\nThe game looks great, it\u2019s pretty unique, it\u2019s like realistic but cartoonish at the same time. I also noticed how we have a game based on a character that\u2019s so much into photography and art, and the developers give us a game full of beautiful scenarios for us to \u201cphotograph\u201d. There\u2019s certainly tons and tons of screenshot worthy moments in the game, waiting to be captured. It\u2019s like most of the game is a golden hour itself.\n[b][i]Your life is still yours to live.[/i][/b]\n\nNot to mention, the soundtrack. This is totally not my type of music, it doesn\u2019t fit my style that much, but this game has me hooked on most of the songs. Jonathan Morali did an outstanding job composing the tracks for Life is Strange, and the licensed music fits the mood of the game so well, especially when those really emotional moments really kick you in the gut, and now you keep remembering them because you\u2019re addicted to the soundtrack. Yes, yes I am addicted too. The songs rely heavily on beautiful and simple acoustic sounds, mostly on guitar, it sets a great atmosphere in the game, such a quiet sound in such a dramatic storyline.\n[b][i]Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans.[/i][/b]\n\nI won\u2019t lie, this game has everything I wanted. It\u2019s beautiful. It has great music. It plays well with the time manipulation elements. It has amazing characters that you\u2019ll find hard to let go. It has decisions that will make you pause the game and stop for a few minutes, because you really don\u2019t know what to do. This game has a heart. A hella huge heart.\n[b][i]I'm so glad you're my partner in crime.[/i]\n[i]As long as you're my partner in time.[/i][/b]\n\nDontnod need all the praise I can give, and more of my money. Speaking of which, I did get this for free. My friend gave it to me, since he bought the Limited Edition after playing through the game. I\u2019m going to do the same, because I want these developers to make more amazing experiences like this. I\u2019ve said it like a thousand times, I hate you for gifting this to me, but it\u2019s okay, I now feel your pain too, thanks again Singast.\nEdit (2016/05/25): [url=http://i.imgur.com/ZdRR3Z5.jpg]Here it is! :D[/url]\n[b][i]Ready for the mosh pit, shaka brah.[/i][/b]\n\nIt\u2019s unbelievably hard to express all of my feelings for this game. It\u2019s a constant sledgehammer bundled with feelings hitting you in the back of the head every 15 minutes, they make sure that sledgehammer really takes the beating out off you. This game made me upset because of one fucking emoji. A simple emoji. Don\u2019t even get me started on the endings, you\u2019ll feel totally helpless and useless, so be ready, I was not. I ended up being selfish, so selfish. Then I saw the other ending, now I\u2019ll never forget it for how gut-wrenching it was. (/;_;\\)\n[b][i]NO EMOJI[/i][/b]\n\nMy past 5 days have been a constantly focused in Life is Strange. It is all I think about, it is all I listen to, it is all I have been playing.

Despite the recommendations from people with gaming opinions I trust, I was nervous that the game's teenage high school setting would be hard to relate to as an old fart and that I would find the game to be little more than a Dawson's Crack-esque 'I'll stare at a lake to solve all my problems' affair.\n\nHow wrong I was I was.\n\nAs soon as the calming and emotive main menu theme started I instantly relaxed and within a minute or two of  the main protagonist Max's company at the start of the game I knew I my fears were unwarranted. What followed was a beautifully paced story, told with real heart. Characters are introduced that initially appear to be one dimensional caricatures, but soon reveal themselves to be much deeper and rounded, making early decisions taken in the game much more complex than they initially seemed. I frequently found myself overthinking things as critical choices came up, second guessing the potential motives of nearly every character.\n\nThe soundtrack and visuals massively contribute to the atmosphere and several times I wished I could just wander around the town of Arcadia Bay soaking up the Autumnal Oregon setting. Coupled with the many references to films such as The Breakfast Club & Bladerunner, not to mention games like The Longest Journey series and Bioshock Infinite, I felt that this game was really pitched at me as an adult and not the younger audience that I thought it was aimed at.\n\nThere is no doubt that some people will bounce off the game, the character Chloe can be very diffiult to relate to initially and I can see that some people would dismiss the game very quickly as a result. For me however, the game got under my skin and after the inevitably tough climax I found myself thinking about the game for days afterwards, about  the story,  about the characters and the effect my choices had on them. The start of chapter four will stay with me forever as a powerful piece of storytelling I think, something that very few games I've enjoyed in the last thirty odd years have been able to achieve.\n\nA beautiful example of intelligent interactive fiction, hella recommended.", "timestamp_created": 1508718876, "timestamp_updated": 1511380246, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837552070617675781", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47649070": {"recommendationid": "47649070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025034529", "num_games_owned": 635, "num_reviews": 66, "playtime_forever": 2353, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549795491}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm way late to the party, and I played this game well after having spoiled for myself the plot and twists and so on (hard to avoid the talk over the years, and it was actually Eurogamer's Let's Play videos of this series that made me want to play it myself).

So here it goes..\n\nDear Lis,\n\nEver since you showed up, you\u2019ve caught everyone\u2019s attention. Although not mine, at least not until I kept hearing your name and seeing your pictures everywhere. Everyone talking about your beauty, perfection, mystery and how interesting you were. Boys and girls, all were in love with Lis. Which made me very intrigued. So I watched you closely but I kept a distance, because you were not even my type. I can\u2019t deny it, sometimes I was attracted to you and wanted to approach you. But sadly I didn\u2019t have money on me, so I couldn\u2019t. So I accepted fate, and kept my distance.\n\nUntil one day, I had enough money. But I wasn\u2019t sure anymore if I wanted you or not. I wasn\u2019t sure if you would even notice me among all these 75 million users. I was just a nobody. I thought of other options, but for some reason, my heart preferred you. I don\u2019t know why or what it was. But I knew you were the one. Among thousands of other choices, I chose you Lis... I think it was destiny. Do you believe in destiny Lis?\n\nI still remember our first date. I waited for you for so long. Was a bad internet day. Then you finally came. I\u2018ve never been so excited to see someone this much before. And for some reason, something about you moved me. I felt this incredible strong connection between us. I felt ridiculously relaxed, comfortable, confident and very interested in you. We started getting to know each other, and you kept me even more and more interested in you. The date ended fast, even though it wasn\u2019t really. It\u2019s just that you made time travel faster than light. I hated it when you had to go. You promised me of another date, and that\u2019s what kept me going.\n\nThe date was there, you looked even more beautiful than ever. Was another perfect day we had together. Until you touched me in a way, I couldn\u2019t understand or know what to feel or think. Caught me off guard, surprised me. It was.. so good! Too good! But sadly you had to go. You left and left me with this fire burning inside me. So many questions, mixed emotions.. I didn\u2019t know what was happening to me! So many questions going through my head. I wanted answers but I had to wait for the next time I see you. I was quiet the whole time, listening to you, melting with you, flying with you. You even brought tears into my eyes. It was a flawless experience. All my worries faded away and I was happy again. Then it was your time to leave, again.. but before you did, you rocked my world!! You left me again with all these emotions and questions. What were you doing to me Lis!!? These feelings, never felt anything like them before, ever! What happened on our last meeting has been on my mind since you left. You were all I could think of. Waiting for our next meeting was the most intense feeling and important thing in my life at that point. But you were late Lis.. again.. I was scared, afraid that you changed your mind about me. That, you didn\u2019t want me anymore. Until one day you said, October 20th you\u2019ll be there. I smiled so wide until you said it was going to be our last time. It crushed me. Flipped my whole world upside down. I didn\u2019t feel like doing anything anymore. You kept me up everynight. I\u2019d roll over again and again. Hearing your name and seeing your pictures in my head. Remembering the things you made me feel. I had hopes that I might be able to change your mind and make you stay. \n\nOctober 20th came. I was both excited and scared. I couldn\u2019t see you. I\u2019m so sorry Lis, I avoided you, stayed away from the feed. It hurt but I had to. Everyone was still talking about you, but it was only making me more furious.. But I knew I couldn\u2019t hide from you forever, besides you were leaving me for good. So I needed to at least say goodbye.\n\nOctober 21st. Which is today.. I waited for you. Again was another bad internet day. Then you showed up. My heart was beating so fast I almost fainted. I was so happy to see you again after so long, but at the same time, all those questions and emotions came back all at once. I wasn\u2019t ready for it. It kept messing with my head the whole time. Taking me on this roller coaster of heightened emotions. Unanswered questions. You were vague yourself. You drove me crazy Lis. I had no clue what was happening. I was losing my mind and pulling my hair out. I was both scared and sad and happy and all at once. You\u2019re doing it to me again Lis. Then when it was time for you to go, you just.. made me make the hardest decision of my life. I literally froze for 10 minutes. I didn\u2019t know what to choose. I cared so much, it was so hard for me choose. But it didn\u2019t matter after all, because whatever decision I was going to make, it wasn\u2019t going to make you stay. So I chose. Tears started falling down one by one at the last sight of your beauty. The last time I hear your heavenly voice. The last time we laugh together, explore together, get mad together, get scared together, see the world together, and be happy\u2026 together\u2026\n\nWhy Lis! How could you do this! I thought you were the one. I opened myself to you. We been through so much together! We changed past, present and future together! We created wonders! Put smiles on people\u2019s faces! We made magic. It was all perfect. Then you just left me alone, sobbing, crying, screaming and bleeding love for you.\n\nWhat I\u2019m trying to say is that, I\u2019m sitting here right now, writing this letter for you in my Asylum cell where I\u2019m getting treated from the mind fucks and emotions you put me through, that all the choices we made, all the memes we made, all the ships we fought for, all the music we heard, secrets we discovered, emotions we felt, tears we shed... will all remain. They will always stay dear in my heart and I will always love you...\n\nYours truly.\nVenus", "timestamp_created": 1445462020, "timestamp_updated": 1445864947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1936, "votes_funny": 938, "weighted_vote_score": "0.897353589534759521", "comment_count": 95, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29926628": {"recommendationid": "29926628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046438242", "num_games_owned": 175, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 1392, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1479588824}, "language": "english", "review": "I guess my review will drown in others, but nevermind.

I think I knew I was going to love it from the opening credits, as the protagonist steps into her high school hallway, sighs momentarily, and drowns out the gossip and hubbub with exactly the right indie song. Her internal dialog runs over the smooth lyrics and burbling guitar as she makes her way through the flowing river of students.\n\nBack in the day, games were always about the gameplay. A game was good if it had fun combat or interesting mechanics. Gaming itself was still fresh and new, and the process of interacting with a computer and overcoming challenges was entertaining in its own right. Lately, though, that hasn\u2019t been enough for me. A shooter where the plot only exists to keep you moving down the path towards the end of the game while both your gear and the enemies incrementally improve\u2026 it feels stale at this point. More and more, I\u2019ve been moving towards games that skip the \u2018action\u2019 entirely in favor of the story.\n\nThe central mechanic of Life is Strange is a key reason it works so well. Max, the hero, gains the ability to rewind time in short bursts. Most games would use this as a way to liven up a combat system or to create intricate puzzles to navigate, but in Life is Strange, you use it to make choices. Everyday, normal decisions, at first \u2014 should you raise your hand with the correct answer in class or not? You see people\u2019s immediate reactions, and if you don\u2019t like them, you can go back and pick another option. Once your choice is locked in, though, there\u2019s no going back.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Fallout 4 \u2014 it soon becomes very clear that your choices have large and growing impacts on the world around you. Friendships and romances begin and end, lives are threatened, and you start to learn more about the characters, the world, and your powers. The ability to rewind time and change your choices leads to long moments of contemplation, exploring all of the options and carefully considering the ramifications, but other than your movement and the decisions, the game plays like an interactive movie. The perfectly selected indie rock soundtrack adds depth and feeling to the scenes and the voice acting is spot on. It takes place in a fictional town in Oregon, and it feels so much like the Pacific Northwest that it\u2019s making me homesick.\n\nI\u2019m only a few hours into the game, and I\u2019ve already completely screwed everything up. I was trying to save someone, but I just couldn\u2019t make it happen. All my decisions have come home to roost. The haunting sound of Jose Gonzalez\u2019s Crosses plays in my ears as the results of my decisions play out on the screen. I\u2019m powerless to stop it.\n\nIt\u2019s one of the few times a game has made me roll back in my chair and just sit, staring blankly at the screen and feeling the sick, sinking sensation of every poor choice I\u2019ve made piling up on me, my good intentions useless in the face of what\u2019s unfolding.\n\nAnd, suddenly, the game isn\u2019t about the game anymore. I\u2019m transported back through my own life, reliving my pivotal decisions: dropping out of college, moving to Costa Rica on a whim, moving to Japan on another. The branching path of the choices that have shaped my life has never been as apparent to me as it is right now. I\u2019m not distraught because of what\u2019s happening in the plot. I\u2019m mourning for all the other versions of me that I\u2019m not \u2014 the ones who bounced down a different path because of an offhand decision, a minor, momentary, careless impulse that sent them spiraling off in another direction. The ones who worked harder, the ones who took more chances, the ones who played it safer\u2026\n\nI shake my head, jarring myself out of my reverie. I chase it away for good with the rest of the glass, the smooth burn searing my throat as I pull myself back into position, enthralled, gutted. All I can do is keep going.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                                                                       Written by :\n                                                                                                                                                       Ben Bagamery", "timestamp_created": 1487338500, "timestamp_updated": 1511678718, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 119, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.858051419258117676", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32041211": {"recommendationid": "32041211", "author": {"steamid": "76561198295541339", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 844, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1460094782}, "language": "english", "review": "Interesting story - Check\nCharacters you care about - Check\nGood visuals - Check\nGood gameplay - Check\nGood soundtrack - Check\n\nWell okay, the game can get a bit too cheesy for my taste at times but that's a personal preference ...other than that I absolutely love this game !", "timestamp_created": 1496063474, "timestamp_updated": 1496063474, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 180, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.901625514030456543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17266676": {"recommendationid": "17266676", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990156043", "num_games_owned": 637, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1688, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1445434994}, "language": "english", "review": "Episode 1: typical teen school drama\n\nEpisode 2: uhmmm.... wha..?\n\nEpisode 3: What.

Wish I could unplay this game and replay it as if I never played it before, just to enjoy the game again as a new experience.\n\nA solid 10 out of 10.\n\nEDIT: Also deserves \"The \u201cI'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye\u201d Award for Steam Awards.", "timestamp_created": 1472559216, "timestamp_updated": 1480426895, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 85, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.82545018196105957", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22705974": {"recommendationid": "22705974", "author": {"steamid": "76561198083077742", "num_games_owned": 104, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 975, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489003665}, "language": "english", "review": "Every 5-10 years a game seems to come along with a special something, A little piece of magic that makes its a unforgettable experience. \n\nLife is Strange is one of those games.

To say this game's perfect would be a lie, it's got faults like any other game, but where its strengths lie are in its ability to create a universe the player is incredibly invested in. I could rattle on and on like my usual Steam reviews but for this game only, and to avoid spoiling the story in any way, I've decided just to make a simple pros and cons list.\n\n[u]PROS[/u]\n- $20 price for the season pass\n- Performance was good and there was very few bugs for me\n- I really dug the unique art style (simple yet visually appealing)\n- The UI is intuitive and very simple\n- A solid story from start to finish (there might've been a few plot holes but I didn't notice any really)\n- Likeable female protagonist and a well-written relationship between her and the deuteragonist\n- Amazing atmosphere\n- Great voice talent (I think a few voices didn't feel \"right\" but everyone else was golden)\n- The song selection was fitting and appropriate\n- Different endings which were logical and nicely executed, to me, for a story that involves time travel (one ending could've been longer though and I suspect many fans might've preferred something less predictable)\n- Real choices that matter early on\n- The rewind mechanic wasn't gimmicky for the most part and I rather enjoyed all of the puzzles\n- The player doesn't take a backseat to the action like a lot of story games I felt (you feel like you're playing a game)\n- A lot of extra content in the episodes (various diary entires, optional photos to take, SMS messages, etc.)\n- Explores a number of controversial issues and/or themes (that few games touch on) with tact\n\n[u]CONS[/u]\n- The pacing could've been slightly better in episodes 3 and 4\n- Past choices don't matter as much in episodes 4 and 5 (I won't describe anything more to avoid spoiling the story)\n- Some characters are more or less stereotypes but each player will feel differently about this\n- The rare corny/cheesy phrase that would stick out (I can't think of an example right now)\n\nI was initially going to include another con but yesterday's update addressed what was the biggest issue for many: the at-times horrible lip-syncing that barely matched the characters' words in the first 3 episodes. I'm glad to say that this has been addressed and I have to give the devs kudos for that. Now fans and newcomers alike will be able to enjoy this game even more.\n\n\nThis game will obviously not be for everyone but I do think it appeals to a lot of people (as seen by the Steam user reviews). It's quite simply a high school drama with a bit of mystery and the supernatural thrown in. If you had thought it was some feministic sort of game like I had initially -  I urge you to give this game another look. I have tried to be as honest as I can about a game which I have thoroughly enjoyed and I hope this review has helped you, the reader, in some way. For $20 I highly recommend grabbing Life Is Strange and if you don't happen to enjoy it in the first hour or so: refund it. I don't think you will though :) It honestly deserves a 8.5/10 in my book.\n\n\n\n[h1]P.S.

It is a rollercoaster ride of emotions, hard choices and relatable characters. For me personally I got to re live a better school experience as a younger me while having time changing super powers. This is by far my favorite and best game choice of 2015, it was worth every penny and will always be a game etched into my memory.

In the game you play as an 18 year old girl Maxine (Max) Caulfield, a photography student, who returns after 5 years to her hometown Arcadia Bay to attend Blackwell Academy, a prestigious private school. After witnessing a tragic event in her school, she discovers she has the power to rewind time and prevents it\u2026\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=611334407\n\n[b]Story? Wowsers![/b]\n\nLife is Strange is a coming of age story about a socially awkward teenage girl dealing with some (really!) heavy issues using her newly discovered power. You control Max through 3rd person perspective, interacting with people and objects. The gameplay is similar to other story driven games like the ones from TellTale Games (The Walking Dead, Wolf among us, Tales from the Borderlands,\u2026) but with more freedom when exploring and dealing with choices, since you can rewind any decision if you are not too happy with its (short-term) consequence. Also there are no QTEs in this game. I\u2019d rather not say too much about the story for fear of spoiling too much  of it, just that Life is Strange has one of the best stories I\u2019ve ever experienced in a game, TV show, movie or a book!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=609885632\n\n[b]Graphics? Hella nice![/b]\n\nI really love how this game looks! Nice lighting effects, character animation and movement, the beautiful landscape of the Arcadia Bay, the art in pictures and photographs. Even though there are some issues with lip-syncing and in one part of the game my Max didn\u2019t even open her mouth when she spoke (I guess she also had the power of telepathy or maybe she was training to become a ventriloquist) I believe Dontnod did an amazing job here.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=608571202\n\n[b]Voice acting? Amazeballs![/b]\n\nHannah Telle (voice of Max) and Ashly Burch (voice of Max\u2019s best friend Chloe) were incredible here. You can really feel the characters\u2019 struggle, pain, love through their acting. I really love hearing Max contemplating every choice she makes in her head, makes you truly question if it was the right one. It comes as no surprise to me they won various awards for their performances in LiS. Kudos to other voice actors as well.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=614577970\n\n[b]Soundtrack? Ready for the mosh pit![/b]\n\nWell\u2026 not really. \uf04a The original score, composed by Jonathan Morali, consists of mostly soft tunes played by acoustic instruments and it fits this game perfectly with additional songs by Syd Matters, The Foals, Amanda Palmer, Alt-J\u2026 Just wow! Be it songs or background music, it\u2019s all so wonderfully integrated into the game and they really help set the mood. I often listen to the LiS soundtrack and even though several months have passed after finishing the game, I still get the feels just by hearing some of these magnificent songs! Ahhh\u2026\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=612225682\n\nLife is Strange will heavily play on your heartstrings and chew up emotions you didn\u2019t even realize you had, but in the end you will be glad you experienced this amazing journey.

I don't believe I have actually shed any tears from a video game before but I'm glad [h1] Life is Strange[/h1] managed to make an adult man stare blankly at his screen for what seemed like hours, all to just push a single button, with tears rolling down his cheek.\n\nLife is Strange has hundreds of thousands of positive reviews and critical acclaim from gamers and critics alike and I feel like mine might be entirely pointless in the grand scheme of things but I wanted to express how much this game, these digital characters, their stories and emotions, their thoughts and fears and vices, how they all contributed into creating one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had the privilege to have.\n\nFor the record, I'm a sucker for interactive story based games like Telltale [i]used to [/i] make and for better or for worse I'm gonna make a few comparisons between them and Life is Strange.\nSo if you're familiar with the genre you're essentially thrust in a sort of 'choose your own adventure' book only this time you can't skip the page ahead and see where that takes you. Well with so many videos and walkthroughs online you [b] can[/b] but that's not the point of the game. \n\nYou're in control of Max Caulfield, a 12th grade student in the fictional town of Arcadia Bay in Oregon, and without going into spoilers, you're about to embark on a great adventure, a [u]coming of age[/u] type of story filled with many themes which teenagers, young adults and even older people can and will relate to regardless of their background,\n\nGameplay wise, you have the power to [i]rewind[/i] time which allows you to change something that happened or you said to someone and to help people around the town. There's a couple of puzzles spread throughout each of the episodes but for the most part they're incredibly easy to figure out and they shouldn't be an issue for anyone. Doing something, or saying something will have an impact on the outcome in some aspects of the game but of course not everything weighs the same. \n\nThere's a very long debate to be had regarding the [b]illusion of choice[/b], that is to say that while the player thinks they have the freedom to significantly alter the course of the games' story, in reality they are being tricked by the game which essentially will lead to a few specific scenarios without too much differentiation regardless of the players actions.\n\nTo a certain degree, most of the latest Telltale games are guilty of that sin and to be honest, Life is Strange does that too but to a lesser extent. However this does not take away anything from the overall theme and power that the story in Life is Strange has to offer. While there are a few 'illusionary' moments in the game and while some choices are for the sake of what would seem mundane matters, Life is Strange will captivate the player in the character development and story progression.\n\nWhen I started playing the game I was a little bit annoyed. I felt like an old man, yelling at kids to get out of his lawn. What are these teenagers doing? With their drugs, their parties, the backstabbing bitches, social media matters, the high school drama. I felt getting irritated by their behavior but then it hit me... I was getting emotionally invested in these characters. I was actually participating in their lives, I actually cared about what was happening. Now that's a sign that the developers had done something very right.\n\nThe story is one of the best I've ever experienced in a video game, in particular an interactive adventure type one like Telltale games; honestly I would say it ranks amongst my top 5 in any game ever. There's a perfect mixture of supernatural, seriousness, humour, action and so much more.\n\nThere're plenty of themes that are explored in the game and there's absolutely something to heavily relate to which makes for an even more impressive way to have the player become engrossed in the game. You have lots of relationship themes, the game in my opinion is a tale about friendship and love, you can explore aspects of redemption, or fall from grace, of betrayal, parenthood... Seriously, the game has absolutely everything to offer to the player. Even more adult themes like sexuality and drugs are given ample time and they're never preachy, oppressive and are always done in a mature and tasteful manner. To see a game explore said themes without insulting the player is actually a breath of fresh air. \n\nThere's plenty of subtle stuff, but that's up to the player to draw their own conclusions based on their own experiences and the choices you'll have to make through the different episodes which will make you think hard before selecting an answer. Furthermore if you regret on a decision, you can rewind and choose another one! This core gameplay mechanic adds a needed amount of complexity to an already simplistic genre and I can only praise the developers for including that and having it intertwined with the story.\n\nAnd lastly, the characters are imperfectly perfect. The people you will meet through your journey will feel like real people and not some pixels on the screen. The voice acting and mannerisms are one of the best I've ever seen in a game and they will elevate the story on whole different level. Max, the main character, is the most adorable, kind, considerate, strong young woman, I've ever had the pleasure to play as in a video game. She's not a sex object, she's not a supersoldier, she is a person whose inner strength (should you choose to harness it of course) is so powerful that she can shape the people and [b]even the world[/b] around her... but that's for you to discover.\n\nWhile I'm praising the game I also have to mention some of the lesser aspects of Life is Strange that while they don't take away anything from the brilliance that surrounds the game, they do look like sort of sore spot when compared to other games. First of all, the facial animations are mediocre at the best of times and outright bad on others. Because of the emotional state of the characters and the game itself, it is a bad reflection on the otherwise marvelous voice acting and emotions the characters convey with the colour of their voice. The models are pretty OK but the lip syncing and facial animations are lackluster. And while Telltale early games were marginally better, they managed to up their game later and since Life is Strange is a 2015 game, the same year when [b]Tales from the Borderlands[/b] released (comparing the best Telltale game here), I can sadly say that there could have been a lot more done on that department. That was the only significant flaw I found with game, besides the simplicity of some of the puzzles as well but that's less relevant overall in my opinion.\n\n\nLife is Strange is a game I would consider art. The game's characters and story cannot be praised enough and I believe everyone should play this game. I'm trying to imagine it as a very successful TV show but I believe most of the messages and themes the game explores would be lost on the TV. While playing the game, simultaneously as yourself and Max you will fall in love with characters, you will hate others, you will experience things on and beyond the typical young adult lifestyle and during the final episodes you will tear up, maybe just a little but enough to know what you experience goes way beyond the monetary cost of the game.

A story-telling masterpiece, from start to finish. Unbelievably well-written and smartly executed, Life is Strange will pull you into its incredibly gripping tale. Like a good book or TV series, you will not want to put it down. Not since The Last Of Us or The WItcher 3 have I experienced something that has sparked such an emotional response. Be warned, this is an 18+ game, and it will touch upon themes that will make you feel uncomfortable, sick, happy, sad, hateful. It puts Telltale games to shame. You will look at the store page and probably think this is just another teenage drama walking simulator, but it's so much more than that. It takes time to pick up the pace, but like any good story, it needs to build up its events leading to its inevitable conclusion. It manages to craft a deep story with layered characters to near perfection. Life is Strange proves again that the videogame industry can push the boundaries of story-telling even further. \n   \nIf this is not enough to get you to buy the game, the gameplay involves you solving numerous puzzles using a time mechanic, but that's all I can say without spoiling one of the best aspects of Life is Strange. The puzzles are very unique and challenging, but never unfair. Graphics are ok, considering the art-style is a kind of water-colored paint. Playing this game feels like walking through an art museum.\n    \n In short, give this game a try. If you like a good story, you will not regret this. It's mature themes might hit you personally, but it will surely make you think about your life and the people around you. No game has ever made me cry, but this one came so damn close. \n\n[i] Everybody cares until they don't.

Now associate that with your life events. How far would you go to travel between parallel timelines so that you can save and savour that one moment you can never let go. The life event that defines who you are. Maybe family and friends. Maybe secrets that you wanna hold back. As Maxine Caulfield, a tender teenage girl who aspires to follow in the footsteps of the renowned Mr. Jefferson of photography art, you will face tough decisions as you uncover mistery of the serial killer that has haunted and amused everyone at the Blackwell Academy school.\n\nWould you take the matter of life and death into your own hands? Would you play God? What's the price? For Caulfield, little does she know that destiny has a far more retched plan as she meddles with time. She confides her super power in her best childhood friend, Chloe. At first, it seems fun proving it to her and amusing her by predicting future events. Maybe even going rogue around Arcadia Bay (the story is set around this place) to such lengths as breaking into the principal's office and tracking down the drug ring (and the serial killer).\n\nThe story follows Maxine's and Chloe's adventures of fun and frolic. The two are inseparable detective freaks. Oblivious to Maxine, the impending disaster to Arcadia Bay will test her 'time' and bring her back to that one most precious moment, the most important of all, the final destination, the butterfly moment, the 'Butterfly Effect'. Torn between emotions and rage, Maxine must 'fix' everything she has sacrificed her power for and save Arcadia Bay from the disaster that is. But what would it mean for her best friend Chloe? What would it mean for her photography fame and career under Mr. Jefferson? What would it mean to live and die?\n\nThis was one hell of a rollercoaster ride! Be prepared to cry.

But then it wouldn't be a moment.\"[/h1]\nLife is Strange is my favourite game of all time. I could go on about this game and it's characters for the rest of my life. \nI love every moment of it. Every step I take as Max, every second I spend in Arcadia Bay makes me happy even when it's sad, connects me to characters who transcend fiction for me, takes me to another world real enough that I wish I could exist in for real. \nLife is Strange changed my life - Life is Strange saved my life. I think about it every day since I first played it back in July 2017 on the PS4. The contents of the game, the characters, are all too real for me, and they've helped me through a lot of stuff, are still helping me through stuff. If I'm having a bad day, pretty much anything Life is Strange makes me feel better. \nTo anyone who hasn't played this game, this probably all sounds crazy. But there's something at the core of this game that transcends easy definition. There's a real human soul to this game that allows me to connect to it like no other art that I've ever experienced. On the surface, it's a choice-based adventure game. But if you're like me, after just five minutes you sense that there's something different about this game. From the calming soundtrack to the beautiful art style, Life is Strange is a fully absorbing experience. \nSo, I could definitely go on forever. I could pour countless words into the review and not be able to fully express just what Life is Strange represents to me. It saved my life. The hella awesome fandom and all the hella great people still creating content makes the game a lot deeper for me as well, but it's just icing on the cake on the most important game I've ever played in my life. I could go on, about how Max and Chloe are my personal heroes, about how I wear a replica of Chloe's necklace everyday, about how I discovered whole new genres of music, about how I learned how to see life in a better light, about how the excellent characterisation shatters stereotypes and caricatures, about the earnest, emotional themes that it discusses, about the utter bastard who is the main antagonist, but if I did, we'd be here all day (not that that'd be a problem for me!). \nSo, I love this game. It's my favourite game of all time, and I imagine it will remain that way for the rest of my life. Somehow that almost doesn't feel like I'm doing it justice. It transcends words, for me. I recommend this game with every fibre of my being. I can see that it has faults, for sure - the dialogue can sometimes be a little weird, the puzzles are rarely challenging - but I still love it more than any other artistic experience I've had. \nTo anyone who decides to play it for the first time... enjoy.

It\u2019s probably my favorite genre, overall.\n\nWhy is that important? Because I have to scramble my brain to find any other examples of games that has captivated me so consistently and felt as evocative and powerful as Life is Strange. I can\u2019t even pinpoint why, not exactly anyway. There\u2019s plenty of weak points here, after all. The graphics are nothing to gawp at. The lip-synching is just awful. The story is interesting, but nothing stellar. Not to mention the puzzles, which are not challenging or even very creative. But I find myself ignoring all of that while playing, because the game just sucks me in. It\u2019s one of those rare games that continue to affect me [i]hours[/i] after I\u2019ve completed an episode. It\u2019s not just me thinking about how I could have affected the choice-driven story differently either. It\u2019s more a sense of wonder. It makes me nostalgic. This game makes me think about my own life. It makes me think about memories I treasure, moments I remember from my youth. I find myself drifting back and forth in my muddled thoughts, thinking how my teenage years were and how they formed me. Life is Strange makes me feel. Not just while playing, but long afterwards. Life truly, is strange. It really makes that statement ring.\n\nLife is Strange then, is one of those games with [i]heart[/i]. It shows its qualities primarily through its characters; flawed and occationally inconsistent, but so relatable, quirky and interesting. Every person has layers upon layers to them, and they all feel important, even when they do nothing at all but sit there. They feel real. And they keep surprising both me and Max, the sweet protagonist.\n\nThe other definitive quality of this game is in its atmosphere. Arcadia Bay, like the characters there, feels like a real place. You just want to explore this world! The visuals and the sounds and music comes together to create a gloriously  calm and warm symphony of lush forests, homey houses and run-down diners. It\u2019s a place that seems to have been lost in time, a small American town that we all could feel some belonging to, no matter what nationality you adhere to. The most inspiring moments in this game comes from just walking and soaking it all in. Or sitting, while Max shares her thoughts with you. It feels precious. It really does.\n\nOh, and did I mention it\u2019s got a sweet time-control mechanic?\n\nNow that\u2019s just icing in the cake, though. \n", "timestamp_created": 1427319631, "timestamp_updated": 1427319631, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 73, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.828513145446777344", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 9, "review_score_desc": "Overwhelmingly Positive", "total_positive": 54939, "total_negative": 2541, "total_reviews": 57480}}
