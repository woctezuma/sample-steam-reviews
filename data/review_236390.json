If you do the research and take a closer look at the stats of every vehicle, you'll notice that Germans, Brits, and Americans get hit with the nerf bat more often in order for the game to be \"balanced\" while the Russian Faction keeps their full penetrating shells, superior jet performance, etc. Looking at the data mined game files, it's been discovered it has hidden stats that give Russian players an edge, which is BS. Experiencing it myself I can say that Russian Vehicles are not overpowered but overperforming.

The engine is very well made, the art is amazing, the controls are good, (unbalanced af)..etc etc ... Tanks are really fun, ships probably are too. BUT The research system killed the game. At high levels unlocking anything would take months of grinding, where as back in the day all you had to do was be the correct pilot level to fly the aircraft and buy the plane with in game currency. Today you not only have to be the correct level, you also have to \"research\" the vehicles one at a time, meaning a new player today would NEVER be flying in my tier. The game's population has been dropping over time because players see how much they have to grind and just quit. For every person that quits because of the grind means the grind gets worse since que times increase. eventually NO ONE is going to be playing besides salty old players like me who are just happy with what they have. I wouldn't even be upset if they made it so you could just outright BUY vehicles for a reasonable price with real money but you CANT you are FORCED to grind. you CAN pay real money for SOME research points though, but you are VERY limited and again, FORCED to grind. I think someone calculated it would cost around 5K USD to buy the research every plane and tank THIS DOES NOT EVEN INCLUDE THE PRICE OF BUYING THE UPGRADES! the research system is TRASH and EVERY PLAYER KNOWS IT. I would gladly PAY for the base game if we got back the original system. Premium vehicles are cool and all, but I want to use the vehicles that I LIKE. When I started playing back in BETA I had ONE goal *GET ME262 MY FAVORITE PLANE* and I did that, In fact I have EVERY me262! If I started today with the same goal I would just quit because I don't have the time. Most of the time in game would just be waiting for the que. And there just isnt a way to buy the plane I want for a few $, no it would cost HUNDREDS to buy every plane in the tree up to an me262. \nI would just suck it up and deal with the grind though if it weren't for this final nail in the coffin:\nTHE LAUNCHER \nwar thunder installs what is basically malware in the form of the game launcher that AUTOMATICALLY runs when your computer starts and is incredibly difficult to remove for the average person. This is something that shouldn't be allowed on steam at all and i WOULD be begrudgingly playing this game from time to time if it were not for this. And getting blown up by late korean war high tech jets with my 'early ww2 first jet fighters ever made' since the matchmaking does not have enough people to create fair matches.\n\nI do want to say the programmers, 3d artists, sound designers, etc are very good and it isn't their fault the game has been turned into what it is now. The original system was so much better and you could actually see your progress and work for a goal.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1549568977, "timestamp_updated": 1549568977, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 9, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.546869993209838867", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49254163": {"recommendationid": "49254163", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063252640", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 33060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548983746}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're going to start playing War thunder, my best bit of advice is don't look at the high tier stuff and aim for that.

It's trying to be as realistic as possible)\n\nOverall this game is really good, but after the years you can see that developers got greedy for money and they'll rather focus on adding new premium stuff into the game than improving the game, but in this game there's such an amount of vehicles you can choose from It's really incredible. There's no other game (that I know of) which has more planes and tanks in one game and which can even be played in the same gamemode. But... War Thunder is a F2P game which means one thing: GRIND. Unfortunately in this game you need to make money (Silver lions) grind RP for new vehicles and even if you get a new vehicle you need to RESEARCH MODIFICATIONS for that tank or plane which is just... stupid. For example in tanks you have to research new shells and even basic parts like stuff for repairing a tank or fire extinguisher. So what about planes? Well... plane without researched mods are just pain too. They are much slower than fully researched, they have less effective armament and you're pretty much sent into battle with inferior plane/tank like: Go, have fun. So yeah, grind is really bad in this game so honestly I recommend you to just get to the tanks or planes you really want to and stick with them. Just have fun with planes and tanks you like and don't bother with grinding.\nAnother problem is consistency of guns on planes. Sometimes you just tickle someone with your guns and they'll get destroyed and sometimes you only get hits or at least critical hit. So damage models on planes need a rework. They barely changed since the game was released, but at least flight models improved a lot since this game was released, but some of them still need more work, but developers won't bother too much with that because that would give them more work and less money than just adding new premium tank or plane. There are of course almost like in any game some balance issues and developers of this game really like to buff something too much or nerf something too much. It rarely happens that they'll hit that middle sweet spot at the first try, but they get to it eventually ... sometimes takes months but better than never I guess.\n\nThis game has it flaws, but it can be a lot of fun especially when you're playing with friends and you have a lot of iconic planes or tanks to choose from.\n\nMy rating for this game is 8/10\nSo cons:\n- Attitude of developers to WT community and the game\n- Some balance issues, map design and some gamemode designs  \nPros:\n- Lot of iconic vehicles to chose from\n- Graphics\n- Gameplay\n- Great mix between arcade and sim\n- Controls\n- Sounds\n", "timestamp_created": 1550269628, "timestamp_updated": 1550269628, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.582504987716674805", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49080840": {"recommendationid": "49080840", "author": {"steamid": "76561198882699540", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1100, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 476, "last_played": 1551012336}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game with great physics and gameplay.

It is a pain to make money to buy the researched tanks over rank 6.0 (10.0 max) \n\nEXCEPT YOU BUY PREMIUM AND MORE PREMIUM STUFF \n(like training speed ups, etc. to have a fair-enough-crew for each tank you like. Otherwise it takes several months to grind them to a barely acceptable level). \nAnd frankly this company (Gaijin) doesn't deserve \u00a350-\u00a360 but not even \u00a320 per month. \n",

in order to get kills and therefore progress, you need to camp 24/7.\nLow BR arcade is the best mode by far, thing move a lot, even if you die, you'll be back to the battle shortly after respawning.\nAs you progress in ranks, the realism is enjoyable, spotting enemies from a far makes it intense and fun.\nThough as you progress\n   America: great armour, good guns,\n   Germany: shit armour for most, great guns\n   Russia: decent armour, no capacity to kill Americans (BR 2 to 5)\n   Others do not rly matter, I guess the Japanese are good though.\n\nOverall Slow ass game, I know it's trying to be realist but common map that are 10 KM long moving at 20 KM/H, it's just straight boring, played a match few days ago 2 guys out of 25 got some kills and then it was over where is the fun at...\n\nDo not recommend til the jumbos are not fixed: historically speaking they cannot even pierce any given German and currently the one shot all of them.\n\nLong review I know but the dev rly needs to listen to the community if we want to have a good experience.\n", "timestamp_created": 1551734254, "timestamp_updated": 1551734254, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0,

Look no further than this. And i mean that literally. Unless you're willing to put in a serious competitive commitment to this game it's not worth your time to go past the World war 2 vehicles (around Battle Rating 7.0+)\n\nWar Thunder is an interesting game, but the lack of cohesion and historical exemptions are pushing a very fine line for me. \nYou would think that in a well situated and tank operating nation say the United States, that they would equip their men with adequate materials to help keep the tank in working order, say spare tracks. But here in war thunder that doesn't exist, and you need to \"research\" your parts and Fire Prevention Equipment for every single tank in your technological tree. No exceptions, you want parts to help put that tread back on? Either pay Gaijin in their premium currency or sit there and suffer until you've suffered enough to actually unlock it. \n\nSpeaking of research, there is a massive amount of it. If you wanted to have a remote chance of being able to unlock all of the vehicles, you'd have to go back to essentially the launch of the game and play from there. I bought this game in late 2017, its been about a year since I downloaded it (off of the Gaijin store) and within that year of semi-continuous play, I still haven't reached the top tier of the British line, you know, the one i started on in 2017. Most of the new vehicles in the game you will never be able to reach unless you A: Pay Gaijin to boost research or B: Spend the next 4 years of your life doing nothing but playing this game. \n\nAlthough this game does have \"realistic\" mechanics, there is a severe lack of cohesion from what I've experienced. And it ain't the 3 hours on my steam account that lead me to such an abysmal experience. Its recommended that British players sit back and let support the objectives in game, which i am more than capable of doing. The problem within that is the following: Most of your team with heavy vehicles and tanks will not push forward to make progress and will stay behind cover or terrain depositions in a sort of perpetual sniping match with another group 600 meters away. (In arcade at least) So now, when the enemy goes to capture the points I'm forced to use my medium armored vehicles to actually get to the points and secure them. Which is hell of a lot harder when you're the only one going. (PLEASE NOTE: This entire paragraph doesn't go for everyone in the game, there have been plenty of times where the enemy foxhole'd up and didn't move and our entire team moving on the points). \n\nOverall I don't recommend this game to everyone. It is certainly not everyone's game and i don't think is worth any payoff. But the game is free and i recommend anyone reading this to (if they wish to) try it out themselves and see what they think.", "timestamp_created": 1549501069, "timestamp_updated": 1549501069, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49332626": {"recommendationid": "49332626", "author": {"steamid": "76561198419391330", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 153, "last_played": 1551641963}, "language": "english", "review": "\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0438 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0448\u0435", "timestamp_created": 1551605927, "timestamp_updated": 1551605927, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49367584": {"recommendationid": "49367584", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963560806", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 39642, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550020130}, "language": "english", "review": "The combat vehicles in this game in [b] NO Longer[/b]  crafted carefully from historical documents and surviving sources.

TANKS!  That was all I needed to know at the time I downloaded this.  Tanks are rad, and this game really nails that statement home if you ask me; visually, and conceptually more so than certain competitors do.  The mechanics for shell-penetration and \"terminal ballistics\", if you will, are outstanding, and really forces a player to think about not just shooting an opponent, but where, when, and how to shoot an opponent.  This level of detail really makes this game stand out in my opinion.  But there's a caveat to this:  It takes a decent amount of skill. \n\nWith that in mind, if you're more of a casual gamer, I would pass this one by.  I'm not into competitive online gaming, just tanks.  For a casual tank-loving gamer like me though, this game is what would happen if World of Tanks met Dark Souls one dark and stormy night, and 9 months later they had a child with a couple of birthmarks that looked like airplanes and patrol boats.  \n\nOh!  My biggest actual gripe against this game would be that in order to get some \"Golden Eagles\"(Game currency) I would need a Steam account(Check), A Gaijin account, AND a DMM account.  Really?  3 accounts just so I can have a couple of fun cosmetic upgrades for a T-34 and just to utilize my transferrable Research Points?  No thanks, I'll pass.  I'm not even necessarily opposed to the idea of a Premium account getting access to extra goodies, but I shouldn't have to give my personal info out to so many entities just to take advantage of this .  Steam should be enough.\n\nTL;DR: Tanks are Cool, Game is HARD, but if you want a competitive game with a lot of technical depth and some truly iconic military vehicles, I don't think you could do better than this, but stick with free-to-play.

The biggest issue I have seen is the creation of this Guijun program which is said by the developers to be an updating program however since they have made it a part of the system, I have never been able to delete the entire program, I have had issues with this program accessing and slowing down my PC which was bad enough and despite the developer's solemn words that the program is a harmless updater I have reservations which have not turned into serious concern in light of the fact that I have not accessed this program for over a month and have denied it access at start up, however it would seem that someone is accessing this program and account remotely, a fact that causes me great concern. The game itself is a brilliant game and i am concerned that it is a cover for a more sinister and devious intention harvest data and to gain access to personal data use each user's PC platform subversively for an unknown purpose. In this current format, I am intending to uninstall and wipe my PC to attempt to remove all traces of this game and programs associated with Guijun and I strongly suggest that all users review and monitor the access that Guijun has to their PCs and information.

Naval, aerial and tank combat.  I only play the aerial and tank modes (Why plane naval when there's World of Warships?\n\nSo, the positives first:\n\nThe game offers a tier system to ensure that you are - generally - evenly matched with who you are against.  So, you wont end up against impossible odds-generally.\n\nOn the tank mode it has a very good kill cam mode where as you hit an opponent it shows the damage your shell has done.  So, injured or killed crew on the enemy vehicle, disabled parts and the such.  This can assist you in gauging if you can finish an enemy or need to admit running away is the better part of valour.\n\nThe overall game play can be fun, and very smooth.  It is smooth and offers a competitive game that is fluid enough to not be boring.\n\nThe flying is very well rendered.  It is very balanced also, and offers a level of realism rarely seen in a lot of arcade like games.\n\nNow, sadly, the cons:\n\nThe tier system.  The tiers are set so tanks in the same tiers generally come across each other- so a tier two Japanese tank will generally face tier two Americans.  HOWEVER... the game developers added an additional battle rating (BR).  The BR system is VERY poorly designed, and very biased.  A tank with a BR of, say 4, can end up facing a BR 5-6 tank.  This means that you cannot combat the enemy vehicle and have to hope a member of your team has the ability to.\n\nPay to win.  The game IS free.  However, it offers a premium mode -which is VERY expensive - which will allow you to bump up experience and money earned in matches.  However, they also have premium vehicles.  These vehicles are usually very overpowered and are set below what would appear to be a fair BR giving the buyer an advantage.\n\nBias.  If you want to play as a home country - Americans play American, French play French etc - that is fine.  However, if you want to win, you really need to play Russian.  I think if the stats and abilities of the Russian tanks where real, they would of conquered the world in the 40's through their construction and unbeatable armour and weapons and not due to numbers.  Until higher tiers the German tanks - masters of the era - are made out to be shoe boxes on rubber bands, and the British tanks might as well of never turned up to fight.\n\nToxic community.  A lot of the community is really good but you find even more find it acceptable to camp your spawn.  This is not such a drama on Arcade mode. But when you are on Realistic, and an enemy tank destroyer - which has been paid for AND is two BR's above you -is sitting in your spawn, it can be a little frustrating.  Also non team players who want to sit on the spawn and just wait with AA weapons.  They achieve nothing, apart from removing a potential weapon from your ranks.\n\nGrind.  The game will make you work towards a tank you want.  However you usually need to unlock AND purchase its preceding models.  This means you spend any money you save on vehicles you do not want.  When you unlock your chosen vehicle, you pay a massive premium to retrain your crew.  Then, you need to research modifications - even basics like fire fighting equipment - and buy it.  But you cant afford the modification, because all your money is tied up in earlier tanks.\n\nOne shot.  There is nothing more painful than grafting, getting your chosen tank, and waiting in ambush to be killed with one shell from across the map by some pervert hiding in a bush.  The flip side...\n\nUnclear gaming aspects.  If you have, say a KV-1 Russian tank, nothing can stop you it appears, bar a T 34, another Russian tank.  Even if your chosen vehicle has a bigger calibre and better ammunition type, it will bounce off the KV.  So bias.  But also watching as shot after shot of yours pierces an enemy tank, puts it into a critical mode, the whole crew are dead...and magically, their gunner comes alive, and kills you with one shot.  However, in role reversal, even with your crew stats updated to a high standard, if you take a critical hit - and are NOT Russian - your crew goes into meltdown mode and just basically blow their own brains out.\n\n\nThere are far more cons than pros.  I play with a few friends, which helps.  But, I feel the game still needs a better balancing system, and maybe the developers need to engage with and talk with some tank historian's just to clarify the vehicles ratings.  Its one thing to say \"We know it had this armour, so it must be this good\" but quite another to sit down with subject matter experts and have them say \"Yes, it had that thickness armour...but it was made from tin foil, held together with duck tape and would not stop harsh language never mind a shell\".\n\nIts still a good game, and a GREAT game for free.

I respect that. It works. A bit inconsistent at times (or so it feels), but it works.\n\nNow for the major (and I mean serious) flaws.\n\nFirstly, the pricing model and the way it is articulated with the in-game economy is predatory. Having to grind absolutely vital modules like Fire Prevention Equipment or a simple Repair Kits is absolutely ridiculous, especially when considering that in-game currency price progression is extremely steep as you gain access to higher level vehicles.\nI wouldn't mind putting in 40 odd \u20ac, as I would for an equivalent P2P game of similar scope and quality. But only if the content I got for it actually corresponded to what a core full game would be, not to unlock some HEAT ammunition upgrades for some obscure derp tank.\n(example: in Paladins, I bought the pack to get all champions current and future, and definitely did not regret this decision at all. I got essentially a full game, minus the shiny bits).\n\n\nAfter that, the flow of games is fairly inconsistent. Most matches I have been in have devolved into painful rolls where one team just ends up spawn camping the other. This has little to do with player competence and more to do with general gamemode design, objective design, and vehicle type match-up. A full team of brits firing solid slugs will have a much smaller margin for error against a full team of Soviet and German tanks firing APHE. Also, whoever reaches its firing lines first usually gains the upper hand, and keeps it.\n\nLastly, speaking of spawn-camping/spawn-killing, this has so far been the most aggravating and unfun dynamic of this game, especially in RB. My current record for fastest death after spawning stands at around 7s. To have areas around spawns not offering any reasonable form of leverage against enemies' attempts at bottling you up is again a major level design flaw (albeit not a simple one to fix, this I am only too aware of).\n\n\nIn short, would I recommend this? For its PvP, that's a definite no. The new player experience of this game makes it feel like an absolute chore.\nThe PvE and test drive are definitely very fun, but come on, that's not why you downloaded 23GB for.", "timestamp_created": 1550930084, "timestamp_updated": 1550930084, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49312129": {"recommendationid": "49312129", "author": {"steamid": "76561198142950910", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1556, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 10, "last_played": 1551690146}, "language": "english", "review": "I like the game , and yes I am the only one without a big-ass review.", "timestamp_created": 1551522215, "timestamp_updated": 1551522215, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49270405": {"recommendationid": "49270405", "author": {"steamid": "76561198135515779", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 6815, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 830, "last_played": 1551823844}, "language": "english", "review": "After playing this game on and off for a couple of years, I can confirm it's great fun (for me anyways).

There are anti-aircraft vehicles, but frequently these are so light that any fighter can strafe you to death, and you are only given tracer rounds, so every fighter knows where you are as soon as you shoot at any of them.\n\nIt's free to play and you *can* win without paying, but paying certainly increases your chances steeply.\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1551531976, "timestamp_updated": 1551531976, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49218400": {"recommendationid": "49218400", "author": {"steamid": "76561198201524711", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 54054, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 574, "last_played": 1551723314}, "language": "english", "review": "So much time wasted", "timestamp_created": 1551039687, "timestamp_updated": 1551039687, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49316529": {"recommendationid": "49316529", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115914405", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7960, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 215, "last_played": 1551538265}, "language": "english", "review": "Pay to win grindfest", "timestamp_created": 1551538368, "timestamp_updated": 1551538368, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49314748": {"recommendationid": "49314748", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037534829", "num_games_owned": 320, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 57302, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1283, "last_played": 1551531841}, "language": "english", "review": "I tried to get back into this game only to realize why I quit in the first place. \n\nThe battle rating in matchmaking is too large in my opinion, you'll notice the problem when your Tiger 2 is facing T-54s and other cold war tanks.

I'm willing to admit that there are casuals who will like this game as well. \n\nBut there are many ways in which the game could be improved. I don't hate the game - I played quite a bit of it only yesterday; but already, each game felt like a one note. \n\nRealism mode was engaging, but difficult - and I'd need a devoted mic group to win in it. IRL, tanks would have had infantry to help them find targets as well. \n\nArcade mode is very much a one note, over all (find and kill the enemy, capture a hill). \nPlanes are a different game.\n\nI was going to play with boats, but the tutorial to enter into it keeps crashing.\n\nBeyond that, jets might change the planes game again. Haven't had a chance to use them, and you may know why.\n\nAll of these feel like minigames, but with only slightly more depth. \n\nA game like Verdun, which is only about arcade-style trench assaults with bolt action rifles in WW1, which you imagine would really feel like a one note, managed to achieve a surprising amount of depth. It doesn't need F2P to keep providing 'new content', and the two companies that made it, from what I know, are indy developers - presumably smaller than Gaijin. They also created Tannenberg, which has larger maps and is set on the eastern front. \n\nWar Thunder promises so much more to the game, but ends up more shallow. The fun lies in being able to drive a great assortment of tanks - but then I arrive at the main problem... having to grind to unlock more tanks. This is pavlov - this isn't gaming. \n\nWouldn't it be better if it was easier to access all the tiers, and then Gaijin made it so that each tier was desirable in its own way? Each tier isn't more fun (because to grinders, 'power = fun' apparently), but simply... different. A different kind of fun. \n\nVersatility is the reason we play a game with so many tanks and planes. And I'm actually fine with P2P for extra game modes, or cosmetics. I don't think it should give players an advantage, or access to the main game. As it stands, Gaijin wants me to pay money to unlock all the vehicles, to experience the core of the game (vehicle diversity).\n\nThat's bad, okay?

However, tier 4 is one fun tier. \n\nRussia- Yes Blyat\nRussia is a beginner country, I suppose, so many meme tanks such as the tiny beast, ASU57. The IS heavy tank line is fun with 122mm guns. However, big guns come with long reload. Playing russians requires trigger disclipine.\n\nJapanese- America but worse\nTier 1-3 IMPOSSIBLE....

The community is also really not that bad but tend to get a bit toxic on high tier matches. It also takes a while to get the hang of it but once you do, you won't stop playing. It's fairly easy to learn. Hard to master. The game in itself is not pay to win but it does have a tendency to eat through your wallet if you're not careful.\n\nNot for everyone though. You're most likely to invest your time only if you have an interest and a general idea about what the game is about. \nThe devs also have their ups and downs but most of the time they're very responsive and helpful to the player base. Although periodically they try messing with the balancing system from time to time which can sometimes go as far as people dropping the game. Plus they could also work a bit better on their marketing to up the player base because it's not doing very good as of now. I mean after 7 years, the game still doesn't have a proper trailer.

I also have been a very good customer of gaijin as I have bought a lot in their store over the years. And since I have invested so much time and money in it, I would like to give a positive review. But unfortunately I decided not to do that....  And also have decided to uninstall this game. At a given moment you are just done and all the trust is gone.\n\nIt is a beautiful game but Devs are just the big problem. They prefer to make new content instead of fixing old problems.\nAfter so many years I have lost all confidence in them. They almost never listen to criticism from their fans and always think they know better. They forget that the fans want to improve the game with their criticism, but are often treated as Gaijin's enemy.\n\nThere are so many problems that it is too long for a review but here is a list with the most important:\n\n1. BR compression. Each vehicle has a battlerating like (1.0 1.3 1.7 2.0 ect). A battlerating is an indication of how good a vehicle is and what it can encounter. The maximum battlerating in a match can be +1 higher to -1 lower than your own vehicle. Which means that you can sit between the highest BR and the lowest BR (uptier and downtier).\nNow the vehicles are too close together in terms of BR, so compression. Which means that some vehicles dominate heavily and some do not have a chance at all when they come  against each other in a match. Gaijin does not want to solve this problem because they want everyone to find a match quickly. (this is my biggest problem with this game)\n\n2. Gaijin censorship, Gaijin does not like criticism. Post on their form that are critical and viewed by enough players just disappear. Gaijin denies, for example, that it was possible to cheat in their game. When a youtuber proved that it was possible. Gaijin wanted to copyright strike against this person or put the Realistich game mode to Arcade. As a kind of punishment for the player or something. I have no idea why.... Gaijin behaved rather childish.\n\n3. Reporting a bug. During the years I reported all the bug that I found to gaijin. I have send replays and information. From 1000kg bombs that do no damage, tanks shot that disappeared in the air, to planes that were shot in 1/2 and keeps flying smoothly. I have seen everything over the years. Fortunately, there are never many bugs.... so that is good.\nBut I have never received any answers from Gaijin. The only thing that is done is that your report gets closed, completely ignored or can no longer be found (disappears). It looks more like Gaijin sees you as a burden instead of help.\n\n\nThere are many other problems in this game such as your tank shots that are absorbed into the Optics of the opponents tanks and do no damage or pay to win tanks like the is-6. \n\nBut i have to stop to keep the review a little short, I close it here. \nWarthunder \"can\"  become a much better game than it is now. There are too few players online to earn money so gaijin wants to pull as much money as they can from the remaining players as possible instead of recognizing problems and solving them.", "timestamp_created": 1536348111, "timestamp_updated": 1536407139, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 841, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.935520291328430176", "comment_count": 47, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false, "timestamp_dev_responded": 0, "developer_response": "1. Yes, that is important part of good gameplay - the ability to find game quick enough.  But we are avoiding 'impossible to kill vehicle' - so basically you can meet more powerful vehicle than yours but there is a way to kill it anyway.\n\n2. All this is misinformation.\n'There is no cheats' was never stated at all. This is part of phrase, switched out of context, from 2013, when there were ONLY TWO game modes - Plane Arcade Battles and Plane Realistic Battles (bot modes are planes only and with markers - so there is no maphack). And full statement was something like 'there is no such cheats in the game like speedhack or invulnerability or kill-all'. \nMoreoever - those days there were no (at least known!) _working_ cheats at all!\nALL so-called cheats were those days just malware. And the statement was perfectly clear and correct.\nThis statement IS CORRECT even nowdays, but with tank battles (especially realistc battles) there are possibility to have maphack or aimbot.\nWhen RB tank battles appeared WE IMMEDIATELY started work on anticheat solutions, cause hiding marks on tanks in client of course can be bypassed by cheaters - 'nevert trust client' is basics of multiplayer code.\nAbout 'banning youtuber' - that is also incorrect. That was bad story, when one of our former employees overreact on one youtuber behavior (while youtuber was viloiting public agreement and EULA, btw). The problem was solved and videos restored in 4 days (youtube guys are slow and couldnt make it faster, while we ask them the same day). We apologize for that and perform some more actions and in a good relationship with that youtuber for long time since that.\nThere issue has nothing in common with cheaters.\n3. MOST of our work is fixing bugs and working on community reports and feedback.\nHowever most of players do not understand that there are LOTS of players with DIFFERENT feedback. We have implemented features of years of manwork (for example so called LastManStading) by users suggestions and than remove them from the game by users feedback. Of course, there were different users - those who suggest and those who protest.\nUser often think that his playstyle and feedback is common and all agree with it, but thats really not that often true.\nWe have 15th game modes that can be treated as different games (tanks, planes, ship, realistica, arcade, simulator, and moreover - jets, bombers, fighters, assault planes, tank destroyers, tanks, rocket tanks, ATGM tanks and so on - there are really different) and players usually do not play even 25% of the whole game and do not see all the game and all other players feedback and opinions.\nThis - game variety (and I'm not talking of content even!

Gaming just isn't a full blown hobby for me. That all changed when I started playing Warthunder way, way back in 2013. The game was mindblowing. Being able to play so many different types of famous aircraft in the midsts of epic dogfights was totally engrossing to me being an avaition nut. The graphics were and still are incredible for a free to play. When tanks came out it was again totally mind blowing to see the tracer rounds whizzing back and forth, something the \"other game\" didn't really focus on. The tanks, the sounds, the explosions, the historic battlefields ( few they were ), really struck gold. But...none of it was perfect. Yea, yea I know, \"But you just said it was mindblowing and awesome!\", yea I did, but it didn't last. It became monotonous when they changed to the RP system, taking literal years for me to get to my first jet ( I still don't have the final fighter jet in the American line ). You have to treat  the game like a job, and after awhile even a job you love get's boring and more annoying. \n\nThe tanks have taken up most of Gaijin's focus, with Realistic Air Battles not being improved in the slightest despite major problems with the gameplay. But even with the major focus on tanks, Gaijin still hasn't done anything with the upgrades you earn with the tank the more you play. Fire extinguishers and parts ( both vitally needed for a tank ) need to be earned. Which means ladies and gentlemen, that in the beginning battles, normally 5-10 of them depending on your performance, if your tank is hit in a vital spot, or is set on fire, you have to sit there completely helpless. It's on of the stupidest things about tank battles, and it's the one option out of the endless that Gaijin chose because it's the one that will get them the most money. \n\nFrankly. I've put over 1800 hours into this game, more than any other game I've ever played. I'm going to continue playing it. But it's a game that you don't want to get involved in. It's fine in small doses, but you'll never get any of the vehicles you want if you play that way. I simply can't recommend this game because Gaijin doesn't listen to the community, and the game sucks all fun away like a black hole.\n\nI would just like to add that you'll notice a vast majority of negative reviews come from the players that have put many, many hours into the game, including me.

This review is aimed for new players looking to get into the tank part of the game.[/h1]\n\n[i]Note : If you are interested in aircraft or ships, skip this one.[/i]\n\n\nThe game is developed by a Russian company, Gaijin - they work with another company to make the vehicle models and other individuals and contributors to get real data/information on how they performed in real life and how to best represent that in-game.\n\n[b]The Positives Side : [/b]\n[list]\n[*] The graphics are stunning. Very accurate models, world detail and the new Dagor 5.0 engine did wonders for the game and they've promised even more optimizations in the recent Russian stream. The overall feeling is quite good, although the warlike atmosphere (such as smoke clouding the skies) could be a bit better. \n[*] UK, USA, Russia, Germany, France, Japan and soon Italy will be participating in ground battles. Each nation with their own playstyle, shells, armor layouts making for a refreshing experience.\n[*] Accurate ballistics and armor composition make for a tactical tank combat that requires knowledge before player skill. In-game stat cards give an overall idea of what the tank is capable of, how much punching power it has and what type of it can deal with. It's quite a steep learning curve for the first hundred hours and even by then you'll still have questions about how to deal with certain targets and what to look for. [i]Hint : Look for answers on youtube and reddit, not in-game.[/i] Rome wasn't built in a day and you will certainly not understand War Thunder's mechanics early on. \n[*] The tank models are really well made. I mentioned this before and I would like to emphasize on the \"weight\" of the tank compared to Wargaming's World of Tanks. You can really feel like you're driving a tank and not Mario Kart. The pacing is slow in two game modes, and a bit quicker in the other one (more below).\n[*] The sounds are excellent. From 12.7mm Anti-Air guns, to big 150mm Sturmpanzer cannon - deeper, realistic and satisfying shell sounds are what help with immersion when playing this game. \n[*] Three game modes to please every tank player - Arcade, Realistic, Simulator. All have their differences ranging from engine power (with Simulator being the closest to real values and arcade having extra power) to aiming assistance. \n[/list]\n\n[b] The Negative :[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Gaijin has to be one of the worst offenders in gaming history. If you have an extensive gaming experience you are already thinking of Nexon, Trion, EA, and half of the developers in the MMORPG market. The one thing they do not have compared to Gaijin is the [b]grip on a niche audience[/b]. You see, there's no competitor to War Thunder in the entire gaming industry. World of Tanks and Armored Warfare target a different audience - one that likes arcade style hitpoints, peak-a-boo style of tank play. The audience of War Thunder is completely different. You have community members who spend an absurd amount of time finding documents, conducting research unlike in any other community you'll ever see. Because there's no competitor on the market for a realistic war game with tanks and aircraft/ships, [b]they own this entire audience and they know it[/b]. This company has pulled of unprecedented levels of unprofessionalism and lack of communication with the playerbase that would've grounded [b]ANY[/b] company including the owner of this store you're reading this review on. Constant lies, fabricated \"sources\" and documents, selective feedback. I could go on forever here, but EA has that stigma because it was Star Wars and that hurts Americans, not because they're worse than Gaijin.\n[*] Infurating matchmaker - The matchmaker is set to +- 1 battle rating. What this means is that having your best tank a 3.7 Sherman you will at worst be matched with players that have either a 4.7 vehicle as their best, or at best with players who have a 2.7 tank as top. In lower tiers this is not really an issue, you will learn and adapt to a different playstyle. However as you move up into late World War 2 vehicles where armor really matters and further into Cold War T-54s the matchmaker becomes such a problem to the point of frustration. Depending on the game, your best tank will not be able to penetrate frontally any of the enemy teams excluding cupolas and machine gun ports (if they have one). The community has been asking for a +- 0.7 battle rating matchmaker for [b]YEARS[/b], but they haven't listened and never will. Good luck fighting an American T29 heavy tank hull down on your Panther D, you will never win.\n[*] When you get a new tank, you get a stock performance which can be further improved by researching modules such as \"Engine\", which gives a better acceleration, \"Brakes\" that help you break quicker and allow for quick retreating if you're caught off-guard and many others. Among these modules you have two culprits where one of the shittiest player frustration mechanic in the game is - \"Parts\" and \"Fire Prevention Equipment\". Without the first one, you cannot repair your tank, unless you're sitting on your objective. If you take a shot and your gun breech is damaged, you're out of combat for the rest of the game, since shooting with a broken gun breech will detonate the shell inside your own tank. If you take a shot to your transmission you'll be stationary the rest of the game. If a similar situation happens 20 seconds into the game...you can see how fun that might be. The best is FPE - if you get shot in your engine or fuel tanks, you'll be set on fire. You guessed it, without this module you'll continue burning until you're dead. The removal of these two modules has been asked since closed beta - Gaijin refused.\n[*] Community management - No developer reads the international forum in English. Instead there are moderators who \"forward\" suggestions to them for review. This is fine, they're not required to know English, it's an absurd request. The moderators on the other hand are absolute morons and worthless human beings on a power trip. If they do not like your suggestion your post will never appear. Your communication with the developer is entirely gone because no one heard it - not your fellow players who could upvote that or give feedback to you on how to improve it, or why your idea is totally wrong and you should come back with a better one. Radio silence, it's gone. They shut down opinions they do not like or that highlight the Russian favoritism that is present in game (there's plenty of evidence of this, ask me below if you want) and ban everyone that talks back. Truly one of the worst forums out there.\n[/list] \n\nSomething to note about the community in-game : I was a bit surprised coming from World of Tanks and it's cesspool. Most games go without anyone talking other than radio commands \"Attack X\", \"Defend X\", \"Follow Me\" etc. Very rarely do you get dirtbags and flame wars, it's surprising in a PvP game. Usually it's someone venting in [ALL] about bias, rarely personal. They're far more talkative in Simulator Tank Battles, really nice as well. Overall a decent community I would say, on reddit too if you ignore some of the usual internet types. \n\n[b] Final thought :[/b]\n\nThe game itself is excellent, there's nothing like it which is why I've played it for so long. It's interesting, you also tend to learn things you never knew just by playing and talking to other community members - tanks, the war, other projects, prototypes and so on. \n\nI wouldn't recommend it to anyone however. The further you go, the sadder you'll feel about what a company like Grinding Gear, Digital Extremes or Obsidian could've done with this. This is the best war game on the Steam store, made by the worst company.", "timestamp_created": 1523966971, "timestamp_updated": 1524561282, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 185, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870676696300506592", "comment_count": 24, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41691857": {"recommendationid": "41691857", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979538976", "num_games_owned": 6931, "num_reviews": 158, "playtime_forever": 44132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545055686}, "language": "english", "review": "I am playing War Thunder since the beta, when unlocking planes was actually enjoyable and there were no \"stock\" useless vehicles. Many \"new\" simpleminded fans that defend Gaijin don't know that this game didn't have a research system back then, while now it even has the same spotting mechanics of World of Tanks. Altough they're more refined, like pretty much every aspect of the game. This one can be considered as a semi-sim with also an arcade mode.\n\n[i]I own a Premium Account since release and most premium vehicles. Please read it trough the end, because this review is not about the quality of its gameplay, it goes beyond that. I hope Gaijin will notice the reviews and understand why the population has dropped trough the years, with an average of 80-100k players online before the 1.37 (when there was no research system), to an average of 30-40k (with tanks too). Triple the content, less than half population.[/i]\n\nAfter all the miscommunications (bugs being fixed a year after the community notified it, disliked events, introduction of loot boxes to get old-limited-events vehicles and more) and the continuous mocking and hostility of the moderator [b]Stona[/b] towards members of the community, even when they only ask for changes to the balancement or japanese prototype tanks (they have a poor tree and are unplayable), I thought that I had to write a new review for the game.\n\nWhat can I say, the War Thunder has gone a long way since then. New nations, an entire new tank-based game (Ground Forces) and the announcement of the both ships and helicopters in the near future. It's sad to see the player base dropping costantly every year, since the 100k+ that were when we had only planes, to 20-30k.\nUnfortunately, while the content has slowly got better, the progression has not. I also made the horrible choice to grind Japan. While the first two tiers are enjoyable by free2players too, the higher we go on the research tree, the worst it get, to a point where dying may even give you a negative amount of money. To me, with a premium account and 50\u20ac premium tanks with extra rewards, it may not be a problem, but it is to anyone else. The grinding for research points gets tedious since mid-game for tanks and late-game for planes, and you have to consider also the amount of money needed to do everything: \nDo you want to buy an unlocked vehicle? Buy it. Do you want to equip it to a crew? Pay (even 290k for top tiers). Do you want to shoot? Buy the ammo, Is it broken? Buy the repair service. What about events? Pay for the ticket.\nSure, it is immersive to pay for some features, but all of this balance create a lot of issues to other players. \n\nAnd what about the modifications? When you research and buy a vehicle, it doesn't come at his max potential. It's a stock vehicle, with basic ammo, a worst engine and whatsoever. If you're interested in planes you should be good, your plane will be usually worse than the others but you'll be able to play and slowly spade it (i.e. max it). Oh you're interested in tanks?\n\nThen [b] welcome to fucking hell.[/b]\n\nTo make a tank playable you usually need at least two upgrades: Parts and FPE. Parts is an upgrade that let you repair your vehicle, FPE is an extinguisher to put off the fire. To get the FPE you first need to unlock another upgrade, so a total of 3 upgrades are necessary. MANY tanks are also useless at their battle rating (another issue which I'll describe later) and to make them playable you'll need advanced ammo, which may request up to 4-5 upgrades first.\n\n[i]\"Hey but I just unlocked the parts with one match\"[/i]\n\nHeh, sure it's good to play at Rank I-II, when you only 2-5k research points each. At Rank V-VI it becomes 16-24k, even 40k in some cases.\n\nImagine having to grind 16k (Average f2p gets 2-3k I think, when it actually get kills. A premium player with a premium vehicle usually get 10k) without penetrating ammo, without being able to repair as soon as something hit you and with the survivability of a dodo. What if I matchmake your tank to an higher battle rating? Owww damn, your tank exploded right away, it was expectable indeed. Pay me 8k please to repair it.\n\nRepeat that for every new vehicle you'll unlock. Welcome to Ground Forces. Fortunately you can pay to buy a Rank IV/V premium vehicle and enjoy the bonus rewards and a fully spaded tank. 49,99\u20ac over your sanity. And don't forget to buy the experience for your crew or they will suck. Always, even after 200hr you will not have enough experience to max a single crew and you'll pay real money to do that.\n\nLast, about that battle rating I mentioned: it basically represent the strenght of a tank on a fictional \"tier list\".  It influence the matchmaking. Whenever you queue the game uses your highest rated vehicle in your formation and searches for other players with the same battle rating OR a fluctuation of +1/-1. If you use a 6.7 tank, you may end up with other tanks from 5.7 to 7.7.\nObviously the chance you will end up in a 7.7 match are 80% and guess what, most tanks will become extremely hard to play and - if lacking FPE/Parts/ammo - the may become completely useless.\n\nMix all of that and do your math. It's a well-made game, fun, varied and with both arcade and simulative modes, but this is really infuriating and has to stop. Get back on track.\n\n\nGaijin will never read this, but by making these two small changes they would make it surely more fun and bring back the community. The reduced matchmaking would be compensated by bigger numbers. I'd also remove the \"Parts\" from the game, but I guess that's too much to ask to Gaijin.\n\n[list]\n    [*]+50% rewards to all vehicles (they use visible % under every vehicle to balance the rewards)\n    [*]Reduce the matchmaking from +1/-1 to +0.7/-0.7.\n[/list]\n\nThere are more than 1000 vehicles right now, at least 3 more than when it started. It's time to reduce the grinding to these new standards. Even more if we include the upcoming ships, the italian army and the mentioned \"two new nations in the next years\". How is a new player supposed to reach rank III/IV in three different modes and multiple nations?\nMost new players stop after third/fourth rank of a single nation.

I've been playing this game casually for years now with the occasional \"This is my day\" session... And well I still havent unlocked tier 5 vechs.  I've even bought a premium or two. Before you say get better... At a certain you have diminishing returns. Meaning a game i just played before making this review I scored 12 kills and no deaths in a match. This isn't much better than say 4 kills and 3 deaths research wise. The difference is making more money due to not dying. \n\nCurrently researching the next tank that costs 120k Research points. for 12 kills I made 1.8k Rp.

I really want to like this game. Unlike a lot of kiddies who post on the forums, I am much older. I am a gamer from the 80's, growing up on simulators from the 80's and 90's like F-15 Strike Eagle, F-18 Interceptor, Birds of Prey, Their Finest Hour, Knights of the Sky, etc. These were on the Commodore 64, Amiga 500, etc. \n\nIf you are younger and unfamiliar with these titles, look them up. It will give you an idea of how long I have been around flying the cyber skies and coming from an experienced point of view.  I guess that's why I am amused when kids try to lecture players who have been flying sims for decades before they were even on the earth. So, for the younger among us, you can learn something from your elders. \nWarthunder is very frustrating, it has the potential to be a really good game, but instead is held back by Russian nationalism and left over cold war era mentalities. \n\nI have spent many hours and money on this game, I have supported them financially and really have given them time to fix their problems, unfortunately they continue to run with a delusional narrative. \n\nOften you will hear people claim there is a Russian bias to the game. Well, to be blunt, yes, it true. The only people who argue otherwise always prove to be A) of Russian decent themselves and take it personally, B) Are apologists for Gaijin and tote the typical fan boy nonsense, or C) They use Russian tanks or planes and are comfortable in their over powered vehicles, afraid they will be taken away. \n\nRecently, one of the developers for Gaijin stated that \u201cthey cater to the Russian audience because that\u2019s where the money is, they also don\u2019t want to be embarrassed about Russian past or tech\u201d\u2026\n\nSo what does this mean exactly?....Basically he is saying they\u2019re going to fudge the facts for the sake of Russian ego?\nI take issue with Warthunder because Gaijin continues to claim they strive for \u201chistorical accuracy\u201d however they have shown no real attempt to make that so. \n\nThey make disparaging comments about German WWII tanks, planes and tech of the era. They claim their hardware was inferior to Soviet hardware, and all the publications that say otherwise is pure \u201cwestern propaganda\u201d.\nAny objective student of WWII history knows the Germans were known for having very advanced superior equipment. There is a reason Both the U.S. and the Soviets were grabbing up as many German scientist and tech as they could at the end of the war. \n\nThe Planes and Tanks\n\nWarthunder has dishonestly taken Russian planes that were underperforming or produced in low numbers, and exaggerated their abilities. They also have a whole SEPARATE development team for the Russian planes vs the rest of the planes. What does that tell you? \n\nThe P-38 lightning doesn\u2019t perform anything like its real counterpart, I thought, \u201cman, this plane flies like crap\u201d, so I did some research. I found out that Gaijin gave the P-38 a heavy bomber/fighter flight model, they assigned the A-20 flight model to the P-38 lighting! But wait, what did they do with Russian planes that had unfinished flight models? They were simply void of any drag penalties. Instead, they left out variables on the planes, causing them to perform UFO like Arial maneuvers. \n\nThe bombers are all nerfed with bomb load capacity, however without any explanation, the Russian Yer is conveniently left without the same changes, and is allowed a higher capacity. \n\nALL U.S. Navy aircraft are atrocious. They don\u2019t perform near to their real models. The  F-4U Corsair, which was nick named \u201cwhispering death\u201d by the Japanese can\u2019t be flown more than two minutes without it beginning to overheat. \n\nThe P-63, which was not a very good plane in general, is given super capabilities. Gee\u2026is that because the Russians used this plane in the war from Lend Lease? Well, what does this tell you? If you look up the P-63 for the Americans, and the P-63 for the Russians, WOW!....the P-63 for the Russians is magically superior in performance despite being an export of the same plane. \n\nThe bombers?....They use to perform ok. Now their destroyed with a massive nurf where a couple of shots from a machine gun will explode a B-29! Its truly ridiculous. \n\nWanting to see for myself, I began to fly Russian planes. Sure enough, the ease in which I could fly around and destroy the enemy with ease was absurd. I shook my head in disgust and quit right there. I later came back and tried again, yet the same thing is happening in tanks as well. You have T-34\u2019s driving around pawning Tigers for crying out loud. \nThere is so much examples of this, we could be here all day. This is only further supported by their absurd forum posts where they talk about Soviet tech being superior to all other nations in WWII. It really is amazing how strong their bias truly is. \n\nThen, Gaijiin behaves like a bunch of KGB thugs. If ANYONE brings up anything deemed slightly critical on their forums, ALL dissent is immediately locked, silenced and deleted. Threads are deleted or locked, and people get banned, simply for holding an opinion they don\u2019t like. Google Gajiin extorion scandal\n\nThat behavior alone truly is disgusting. Here is a real kicker though\u2026.look at Gaijiin rules for the games. They state that \u201chistorical characters who violated human rights are not permitted to be mentioned\u201d. \n\nHmm\u2026so History they don\u2019t approve of is out, talking about history is out\u2026.but here is the best part. Hitler is a no no\u2026can\u2019t talk about him. But wait!......Stalin, a monster who arguably was just as bad if not worse than Hitler, killing 20 million or more of his own people, he is perfectly fine! In fact, Warthunder will even let you put the words \u201cFor Stalin\u201d in Russian on the side of your tank or plane! YAY for double standards! \n\nTeam Work?.....foget about it! You have kids flying around ramming, or...while you are working on a plane, they will show no dicipline or respect at all. Rather then hold off your wiing, they will try to fly in front of you while your shooting, and take your kill! Now, 3 things happen here. A} They fly infront of your fire and get hit, then you get penalized for team damge. They also will idiotically accuse you of twam killing. B) they dont get hit by your fire, but cause you to have to break off to avoid a collsion and screw up your kill. Or C) they collide into you, and then accuse you of ramming them. \n\nThere is no mutual respect for team work in this game. It would help if they would implement coms for the whole team, and allow more then 4 players in a squad. Another nice feature would be the ability to fly in the same plane. Firends should be able to get in a bomber together. \nAs of now, IL-2 Battle of Stalingrad seems to be clearly much better. \nIn the end, this is a good game that could be great. It really could be. Unfortunately, it\u2019s undermined by its own developers who have been spoon fed Communist era propaganda to the point of absurdity, who then turns around and can\u2019t help but put it in their own game, only to pull oppressive tact by silencing anyone who dares to point out such nonsense. \nI have been waiting a long time for them to get with the program; unfortunately I am most likely waiting in vain. \nWarthunder has become nothing but a propaganda mill, with Delusional re-writes of history where Red Army planes filled the skies and dominated over the Luftwaffe and all other nations. It\u2019s a joke and insult to call this poor excuse of a \u201csimulator\u201d anything close to being \u201chistorically accurate\u201d\u2026only in the world of Commie make believe is this game close to anything historical. \n\nSadly, I\u2019ll probably still play this game, only to be constantly reminded of how great it could be.

I saw the gameplay. I decided that no game had ever done something to appease casual players and hardcore lovers of aviation and ground warfare. I had extreme hope for the game. It continued improving and I saw no end in sight.\n\nThen tanks got released. Servers crashed randomly on launch week. I didn't believe the game could get so popular over a single update. But strange things started happening patch after patch. RP rewards became lower and lower. A 10 kill game in RB with a Talisman and premium account could net you 40K+ RP. You got REWARDED for how you performed. Non-premium players didn't get the short end of the stick either.\n\nBut they continued to lower RP rewards as new vehicles got added. They started costing more and more. Modules started costing more and more. Some module tiers would cost the same amount of RP as a whole new vehicle. At this point, premium time became something mandatory, a luxury.\n\nModule and vehicle grinding WAS fun, because you could experience new vehicles while getting modules during your free repairs. It was a chore you could enjoy, knowing that you could easily do it again tomorrow.\n\nAnd now? Doing that same thing equates to scrubbing your whole bathroom every single day for 2-3 whole hours ( if you're lucky to even get one whole module ). It became sickening and absolutely horrid. It's not your everyday house chore, it's a MINIMUM WAGE JOB. That's not something an \"entertaining\" game would do. It's something salarymen would offer you, without considering the fact you CHOSE to spend your free time on a game you WOULD LIKE TO PLAY, but instead are abused by.\n\nWake up Gaijin.

They do not tolerate it at all and you will have your post removed and will be given a warning point. The forums are helpful, but can be avoided entirely - which is what I recommend.

But all our comments are in vain, for the devs will have none of it. they'll just delete your comment from the forum (or worse). \n\nAnd when you do spend countless hours and  a good sum of money on it, don't try to switch to ps4, because you need to make a new account on it. so you can start all over again. \n\nhaving said this, I will probably go back to it some day. Ships are coming (and let's be honest, i'm just a sucker for this game) I'm just trying to play a small part in a very large game, If we let devs screw us over, eventually they will. We have to fix this industry ourselves! \n\nNow prepare, Fanboys are coming!", "timestamp_created": 1512902083, "timestamp_updated": 1514409164, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 237, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826177537441253662", "comment_count": 28, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18192832": {"recommendationid": "18192832", "author": {"steamid": "76561198023425411", "num_games_owned": 231, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 203412, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 799, "last_played": 1551871452}, "language": "english", "review": "War Thunder has been going downhill at a very alarming rate for the last year or so. I would have recommended the game 4 years ago when it still had the benefit of the doubt, but now I wouldnt recommend it to anyone. \n\n1.57- This might be a fiarly good patch. Tons of new maps, planes, tanks, EC changes, and increased bomb damage(?). The only thing that I dont like is the complete kills on a tanks crew. It is sometimes difficult or impossible to pen a tanks hull, which means you will not get the kill if the last crew member switches to the drivers seat.\n\n\n I could see the mechanic being usefull for a tank with two crew, but have the guts and brains of your 6 friends splattered all over the tank would prevent me from freely moving around the cabin. It doesnt impact me much though, I only really play in the air war.\n\nEdit- Alright, I think Gaijin finally did it. They have completely killed my desire to play ground forces. Complete kills are almost as worthless as the crew locks and spawn camping. At least I can still fly my planes as long as I take off within 30 seconds...\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMore edits- Apperently, they found a way to screw up the high tier BR even more. F80s and Hortons are now matched up with sabers and mig 17s and late war tanks now must fight the best of the cold war tanks. Random sim mode was deleted and the T-34s were given ammo that they never had. I think im done with this game for a while.\n\n\n\nEDIT- I have been playing the game again at a friends request and I have noticed some good changes.\n\n-They seem to have taken notice to us Simulator mode players and are catering to us a little bit more.\n\n   -We now have a somewhat polished version of EC mode that looks like it will be sticking around for a while this time.\n\n  -For the first time in recorded history, they actually listened to us and kept the normal sim mode in too. It is nowhere as good as the old sim mode, but at least they didnt make it worse this time.\n\n   -They fixed the aircraft rendering at long ranges, no more 1km wide planes when viewed at long ranges. Long range spotting was way better at the launch of 1.55, but this is better than how it was a few weeks ago.\n\n\nIts nice that they stick the occasional muffin in the piles of dog shit we get for every patch. Its better than nothing, I guess.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\nSuch a great idea for a game that is completely ruined by greedy and blind devs. Here are a few reasons why you should stay away from this slime.\n\n\n* Matchmaking was bad, but they just put a bullet in its head in the last patch. Cold war tanks/jets are now able to fight late war planes with matchmaking that completely favors Russia in every way.\n\n* Zero involvement with the community. Normally, listening to the players and adding what they think the game needs will make the game better. These guys dont even care about the players anymore, they hired REALLY bad moderators for the forums and straight up ban people who dont hail them as gods.\n\n* Plenty of broken promises everywhere. We were told we would have bomber internals over 4 years ago and they still have yet to add a single one. We were told we would get better matchmaking over a year ago and still have to see a single shred of that. They said they would give us awesome new damage and flight models, we still fall out of the sky if our wing gets scratched. We were told the game would stop at 1952, but they are adding vehicles from the 70s because Russia always has  to one up everyone else. \n\n* Historical accuracy was thrown out the window. They give Russian planes lower Battleranks so they always play against lower tier planes, this means that 1944 Russian planes fight 1942 and lower German and allied planes. They also like to make Russian planes and tanks WAY more powerful than they actually were\n\n* They keep reducing the armor and power of planes and tanks of the Allied and German forces because they claim that they were just propaganda and they never were that good. At the same time, we are throwing RUSSIAN documents at the devs that show how bad Russian tanks acutally were, and they call it lies and anti Russian propaganda.\n\n* There are plenty of planes that CAN NOT STALL. Most Japanese planes and plenty of Russian planes will not stall, wingtip stall or flatspin in full simulator settings. It is just like flying a spaceship while everyone around you has to obey the laws of physics.\n\n\nDo yourself a favor and stay far away from this pile of ultranationalistic garbage.", "timestamp_created": 1443221094, "timestamp_updated": 1458177538, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1493, "votes_funny": 114, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838026165962219238", "comment_count": 46, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34356899": {"recommendationid": "34356899", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972491838", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 19460, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1163, "last_played": 1551824414}, "language": "english", "review": "100+ Dollars spent.\none day hacker gets onto account literally days after I spent the money. so I make gaijin support ticket only for them to tell me to talk to steam.

Likely 1,000+ hours was invested there.\n\nThe Good: \n-Beautiful engine that is able to handle air combat, tank combat, and soon naval combat all in the same single game client, and sometimes in the same game mode.\n-No HP bar. Vehicle internals and crew placement are simulated, armor thickness relative to angle is simulated. If your shot penetrates and hits something critical, it matters. If it passes through empty 'dead space' within the chasis, it does nothing.\n-Tier 1 through 3.5 is fun, especially in tank combat.\n-Varying authenticity levels available. Arcade is fast paced, while simulation and realistic are slower with more difficult controls.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The sense of progression slows down immensely beginning in Tier 3.5 - Tier 4. There is a tarpit in the transition between late WW2 and 1950's postwar tech in Tier 4 - 5, especially with tanks. If you get downtiered against earlier WW2 tanks, your late WW2 tank may have a small advantage. But if you are uptiered against post-war tanks, they will easily outperform you in every way and farm you for kills. Progression XP requirements and repair costs increase exponentially. Due to being outclassed at least half the time, it becomes difficult to consistently earn repair currency or any XP without either dropping back to farming lower tiers with a serious XP penalty, or buying expensive post war premium vehicles.\n- Arcade may be the fastest paced game mode but it also attracts the lowest quality players - they troll by ramming, friendly fire teamkill via call in bombardment or bombing, and complain constantly in the team chat. There is a report function but it never seems to be acted upon by moderators.\n\nThe Ugly:\n-As a company, Gaijin refuses to let you change the email attached to your login for any reason. They don't care if it was your ISP email and you switched providers. They don't care if you used Yahoo 3 years ago and want to change it to secure it after the recent breaches. They don't care how much time or money you invested in the account. Management decided no exceptions because they are scared of people abusing tech support to enable the selling of accounts. Even though you can look at Google and see that account farmers just sell throw away emails with the game account, so the policy is futile.\n\nDo not link an email to your Steam War Thunder account. Do not give them a cent in premium purchases. If anything happens to your email, you cannot recover the account and they will not help you.\n\nThe game is better than World of Tanks, but the company behind it is anti-customer and for stupid and ineffective reasons at that.

I'm also going to try and list the points I still like, and that I find noteworthy.\n\nPros:\n-A good arcade flight experience.\n-A nice variety of vehicles to drive.\n-Fairly realistic physics.\n\nCons:\n-The community moderators censor feedback, and even youtubers like MagzTv and PhlyDaily have been hit with claims, though these claims were rescinded. Simply put, only positive feedback is allowed.\n-Jet combat is hopelessly unbalanced for new jet pilots. If you have a MiG-15, F-86 or Hunter F1, you'll be fine. If you're just getting into jet combat, be prepared for a horrible grind, or prepare to open your wallet.\n-The company treats its playerbase like idiots. They refuse to share any information on the statistics they use to balance the battle ratings, claiming we won't be able to understand them. \n-The instructor system in realistic prevents players from gettoing out of flatspins, which can happen in midair rams. Its not a bad system, but the inability to turn it off completely without using a joystick in infuriating.\n-The company moderators also have the devil's own job of trying to defend the companys actions.

However these flags are easily purchasable for real money. \n     For all of these there is a way to speed up the progression by spending real money. Gaijin have slowed down   progression to such a degree that you are almost forced to pay real money in order to progress in a decent fashion.  \n\nThere is much that needs to be improved, for instance better flight models, a vast improvement to the leveling system and tiering system. Cockpit view for bombers and other heavy aircraft. What is not needed, and what is contantly added, is more premium (and expensive) aircraft.\n\n, for the past couple of years during sales gaijin will raise the base price of a game and then discount it to such a degree that the final price will be the original price before the sale. This is a shady and unethical buisness practice.\n\nThe endgame for war thunder (jet aircraft) is lackluster and unfinished, providing no motivation to stay once money has been given to gaijin.\n\nFinally, the tiering system, by which players are matched up against each other, is horribly inefficient and compressed, meaning players will be competing against far superior planes, and altogether making it unenjoyable for beginners.\n\nFor these reasons, I cannot recommend war thunder to players for purchase. If you can play this game without paying any money, then by all means go ahead, but it has become harder and harder to justify paying for this game.\n\nThis game has so much promise, and I desperately hope that all of these problems can be solved, however on the current path, it cannot reach it's full potential.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1434055950, "timestamp_updated": 1434055950, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 223, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844566285610198975", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18250965": {"recommendationid": "18250965", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050457341", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 264363, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549520577}, "language": "english", "review": "Been playing this game for 2 years and after patch 1.35, the devs have been making idiotic, game breaking decisions one after the other.

Planes are either underperforming or overperforming. Ground Forces (particularly after Tier 3) is pure cancer. Hacking has certainly gone down, but the issue regarding low-quality mode is still significantly reducing playability for Tank Battles.\n\nBefore playing, ask yourself if you're willing to put in the hours upon hours of grinding for the plane or tank you like, or if you're willing to shill out and buy your progression. You can spend thousands of dollars on this game if you're not careful since the grind is just THAT bad now. \n\nA special mention goes to the RP gains from Tanks.

Air and ground forces are unique and interesting. When battles go well (Balanced teams) The game is very exciting and rewarding! There are game modes for everyone. The game is split up in Arcade Battles (For new players) Realistic Battles (For veteran players and people looking for more authentic vehicle characteristics) And Simulator Battles (For experianced players looking for a challange)\n\n--The bad-- The grind for better machinery gets old pretty quick. Arcade battle hold the majority of the player base, causing the game to feel a little empty at higher skill game modes. If a team is loosing in a realistic air battle, but has slightly more ground units alive on the map, That player just flees from battle by flying off to the very far edge of the map where no one can find them OR if they have a fast plane they just outrun all the other players and climb away from battle, resulting in a 30 minute long game of hide and seek where no one wins just because the losing player was salty about losing. This issue doesn't happen all the time but it happens WAY too often.\n\n--The Ugly-- Battles can be short and unfufilling. Some end in just 5 to 10 minutes. Spawn camping is often a problem in battles that allow respawning. Bombers are almost useless in realistic air battle unless you cheese the enemy team with a bunch of bombers, ending the match early, robbing players on both teams of gameplay, and leaving a lot of players upset. Realistic battles, Arcade battles, Single missions, Dynamic campagins, and Simulator battles all have not been changed or really updated in many years plaguing battles with balance/gameplay issues that have never been resolved and likley never will be. Some players (Myself included) are concerned that Gaijin cares far more about making money than making a beter game. Every major patch just adds new content instead of fixing outdated game modes. Map rotation sometimes doesn't seem to exist. Forcing you to play on the same map 10 or more times in a row.\n\n--Final thoughts-- Honestly... Warthunder holds a very close place in my heart... but I can't reccomend it. \nIt has too many small issues that, while not enought to keep new players from trying out the game, have many older players leave the game in disgust... Gaijin keeps adding content to keep players interested which on its own isnt a bad thing, but needs iron out the rinkles that have been in the game for many years now. \nEventually Warthunder becomes exausting...\nIf you haven't played but really want to, dont spend a single dollar on this game until you have played for at least 200 to 300 hours. Then see how you feel. I want to love Warthunder, but it still needs work it might never recieve. \n\n--TLDR-- Don't play until the game gets fixed, Its a not a bad game but has had issues for many years that need to be fixed.", "timestamp_created": 1517997822, "timestamp_updated": 1517997822, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.791537761688232422", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34492598": {"recommendationid": "34492598", "author": {"steamid": "76561198231614732", "num_games_owned": 93, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 210676, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7108, "last_played": 1551844739}, "language": "english", "review": "Who would win? \n\n- A skilled player with hundreds of hours invested into the game.\n\n- Comrade Ivan in his vodka fueled Yak flying head on into you", "timestamp_created": 1503705228, "timestamp_updated": 1503780061, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 280, "votes_funny": 386, "weighted_vote_score": "0.860769867897033691", "comment_count": 29, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18231152": {"recommendationid": "18231152", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037315246", "num_games_owned": 149, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 203710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542265214}, "language": "english", "review": "Update to my review at the bottom.\n\nVR support: they think the Vive is not 'gamer friendly', but they'll support it 'eventually'. Rift support still doesn't work properly. If you want a flightgame for VR look elsewhere.\n\nI'll admit, I'm hooked on this game. But I just can't recommend anyone waste money on this game in the sorry state it is in now. Any player feedback talking about bad things in the game is met with passive aggressive responses from Mods, or just downright hostility. This is just one of the reasons there is no way for player intervention to fix the biggest issues currently with the game. I'm not here to explain the basic concept of the game, just the complete trainwreck this game is becoming. I'll start with my gripes with Simulator, the biggest problem:\n\nThey refuse to admit that its unfair to have third person view available for Bombers, none of the heavy bombers have cockpits at all to speak off, they basically get this virtual cockpit that makes you feel like you're flying a drone than a WWII bomber. They said they would implement bomber cockpits over 2 years ago, they started with the Pe-2/3 series aircraft, with nothing to show for it since then. Bombers in Simulator also get manual gunner control, with the same accuracy and visual awareness they get in Arcade and Simulator, while fighters in those modes also have the same accuracy and visual awareness as bombers, its not an imbalance problem per se. While back in Simulator fighters have no such luxuries, you're confined to a modeled cockpit, with no view besides what the pilot himself would see.\n\nEven today they've admitted that bomber cockpits are a 'long term goal' and that there are more important things to implement, such as more tanks post Korean War. British Tanks, Italian tech tree, More end tier jet aircraft, such as the Vampire, more bombers like the Do-17 series[i](With no modeled cockpit either mind you)[/i] They instead want to implement more vehicles as if that's a more pressing matter than finishing the actual vehicles already in the game. They also have no intention of changing the way bomber gunners work at all, so you'll still have that amazing third person view even with implemented cockpits. The Simulator community used to be a pretty good size when I started playing this game, most people left because they just don't do anything to improve Simulator, player counts keep dropping. They use this as an excuse to not not do anything for Simulator, because the player count is complete rubbish compared to Arcade. Like no wonder man.\n\nTalking about post Korean War stuff. They've had the issue where nobody is playing high tiers 5, the way the game is anything jet powered is in tier 5, regardless of its performance. Anything propeller driven is tier 4 or below, regardless of its performance. For a long time the Me 262, the worlds first introduced Jet fighter 1944, was facing Korean War sabres from the 1950's, it even became its own joke on the net: http://wiki.warthunder.com/images/f/f4/Me_2OP62_-_Back_to_the_Future.jpeg \n\nThe War Thunder Player Council, WTPC, was made up mostly as a PR stunt with voted player representatives, designed for improving communications between Gaijin[i](the game developer)[/i] and the player base. They managed to do a few things, like get the overtiered Me 262 to stop facing the best Korean War vehicles out there such as the Sabre and the Mig-15bis. But everything they've done is pretty much moot following Gaijin's \"Quantatitive Restrictions\" matchmaker just in the last week, the intention being that if you have a team of weak planes, against the other team of weak planes, with 4 or so really really advanced planes on each team, that they'll end up getting all the kills and the rest are dead meat. They've basically destroyed everything the WTPC had done to fix the 'end game' as they call it. \n\nThe complaints from players has always been that there was overcompression with the high tiers. But instead they just overcompress it even more, so everything from the Korean war and post is now facing WWII Jets and props. The performance devide is so big you can't get it anywhere else in the game. They've done the same with tanks too so you have what was arguably the best tank in the game, the T-10M, a Cold War tank from the Russians, facing German WWII tanks from 1944. This was all done to lower the queue times, they thought it was such an problem that people only queued in the T-10M and IS-4M, so they decide to bring the lower tiers into their games. It should have been obvious from the get go that everyone spam queued the IS-4M before they introduced the T-10M, introducing that tank was such a huge mistake. When no other nation has anything close to it.\n\nThat isn't even the best part, they've even given tanks such as the tier 4; IS-2 1944, ammunition that was developed years later, the BR-412D, only ever used on the IS-3 and IS-4M, but they give the IS-2 it in the name of \"balance\", its got a similar penetration as the APCR shell the Germans in the same tiers get, APCR has no explosive filler, but this shell the Russians got has even more explosive filler than the normal shells the Germans get. Insane.\n\nAll this has brown up on the forums, months ago any discussion on the \"ABuse\" of bombers in Simulator was met with a swift warning from a specific Senior Moderator and the threads locked. Guy thought he was 'helping' us by silencing our arguments, as if they didn't exist. As if enemy bombers landing on your airfieild and killing you on spawn with [b]no way to stop it[/b], over and over, is not abusive in any way at all. Here are youtube videos of exactly what I'm talking about: [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zgfRoZchgE]Unconventional AAA[/url],\n [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2Zrvujd0IQ]No such thing as ABuse[/url],\n [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kJFIVJAdwzg]Spawn Camping[/url],\nall this is 100% okay according to them.\n\nThe term \"ABuse\" and \"ABuser\" originates from how easy it is to do good with bombers in Simulator, where you openly have people admit on the forums and elsewhere on the internet, those that mostly play Arcade, \"Arcade Battles user\" play bombers in simulator only because its easier than in Arcade or Realistic, in order to be able to grind jets faster, and only because its easier, its much harder for fighters to take down bombers in Sim than it is in Realistic, where bad bomber pilots would be toast, while in sim even the worst pilot ever, as long as he can keep the plane in the air, can be the best player on the team.\n\nFor as long as you have such incompetent 12 year olds moderating their forums who can't even punctuate properly in any form. There will be no way to even get this message across to the developers because those 12 year old moderators will outright prevent your message from reaching them. But its not just them, even the top guys doing the decisions for the game have no clue what's going on, its as if nobody at Gaijin even plays Simulator at all, or the game in general when it comes to how they're handling tier 5 stuff.\n\nI will only stick with this game for now because I'm a co-leader of a squadron in-game, and I'm not going to abandon them because the game is falling apart.\n\nEDIT: The game still advertises its self as being an MMO, its the same 32 player limit you see in TF2. is TF2 an MMO? No? Then War Thunder isn't either.\n\nUpdate March/April 2016: Most prominent moderator I mentioned is still a Senior Moderator. But hasn't shown his/her face in the Simulator Battles Discussion part of the forum in a long time. WTPC is non existent. They just introduced the P-61 heavy fighter, without a cockpit. Its currently the most devastating aircraft to face in Simulator. Now you get 'captured' when you land on enemy airfields. Simulator is still treated like it's just DLC.\n\nThe following video explains more because I'm reaching the character limit for reviews: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=latDD3xmQMM", "timestamp_created": 1443411208, "timestamp_updated": 1459413676, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 434, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.790488541126251221", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17609574": {"recommendationid": "17609574", "author": {"steamid": "76561198007644998", "num_games_owned": 431, "num_reviews": 81, "playtime_forever": 10274, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439891011}, "language": "english", "review": "[u]Status[/u];\n\n\"[b]LOAD OF (Insert bad word here)[/b]\"\n\nGame is good but their Customer Service just ruined it and completly justified the complaints you read on the web. It took them a year to mess up and for us to have our first brush with disaster. \n\nAfter ignoring the many, and I repeat.... MANY complaints/reviews.... stating WarThunder has no respect, no effort, blown off, lack of responses without reading the initial complaint, ect ect... \n\nLest... we abstained and still gave them a year of my money and time.\nLike always the Review Crew spends our time getting to the truth, being fair to both sides of the coin. but now... the dragon rears its ugly head.... and we had our first problem in nearly a year (171 hours)... and you will be entertained more with our writings that follow, than the game or customer service. In short, we are completly done with this company and anyone affiliated with it!!\n\nWe begin our review...  as we now... ENTIRELY agree with all complaints! After giving them (WarThunder) three (3) months.... to fix a legit, screen shot proven, paper trailing, document provided.... complaint/request for assistance!\nCould of not had this any more obvious or proven if written in blood on a wall, with the killer standing there with a gun and a sign around his neck saying he did it! \n\nNo excuse for reundant, pathetic abuse of people, with proven and legit reasonable request(s). \nThen to degrade us when they(WarThunder) were out of options! We thought ok... its time to give back to us for being so helpful and devoted in providing everything and anything requested (even if it had nothing to do with the request) we provided it. \n\nFor months we tried to help WarThunder to help us, patient, super nice people that just got screwed worse than a hooker at a five and dime. Could not believe the HUGE loads (check my hands) of money we have spent, and sadly... and then the comprehensible (HOLY F*ck what a word!)\n\nBack to the story... while away for a week with my son being born (truly freaking exciting past the point of pee!!! ), we returned as many do after many missed updates (9 to be exact in 2 weeks) \nWe return to find all our money(gold and coin) items(planes and tanks) gone, along with all experience and funds.. just a blank account.\n \nNow to be fair, there was a post saying some updates had data dumps ect... just send us a screenshot and proof and we will do this and that.... ok... so we did.\n\nAccount not compromised, black and white proof of purchases, no acitivity on my end and they did nothing! Did not even bother to read the complaint, responded with requesting this and that and then redundantly doing it over and over.. with nothing to resolve in the complaint. So what was a legit complaint now has 8 more things piled on... but now they expected us to go away... so we asked and pleaded. Stated we had proof and sent it more times over than you see boobies on TV!\n\nWe received a reply that was... for the lack of a better word(s)... MOTHER EXPLATIVE EXPLATIVE... after ALL THE pateince AND respect, fulfilling request after request, for over a 3 months while unable to play!! \n(Listen people, you can dress a turd and call it chocolate, but its still SH*T!)\n\nIt was their (WarExplative) turn to do for us! Three months enough, I believe it is reasonable not to ask any more repititious questions and cater to them. \nWe said \"there is nothing more we can send you that we havent already.\" \nA week later we were returned to an email bearing the surreal.... \n\"we dont care if you leave, your a bumb ass american and we have a million users that spend money, goodbye dumb American.\" from SERGI. So now we research and got attorneys looking into things because of the email. They reached dead end after dead end with the same name coming up as the sole person responsible located in Russia.\n\nExplative, few more dirty words and gestures, and then sad face...!\n\nThere is no need for that! \nUnprovoked... bah.... \nMr. Karma we hope checks this review many times over and pays SERGI and the team behind him....\nSomething with anal beads, super glue and oral suppositories should do.\n\nIt proved what we read from others and didnt believe for over a year, being fair like we always are.\nAlways two sides to the coin... but in this case and thousands of others, the complaints just keep mounting and are more turthful than OJ Simpson bloodsicle, saying he didn't do it for hunger.\n\nSo we call all the numbers we could find to discover one person... SERGEI... (Stupid Mother F*cker for short) handles all their USA complaints as the big man.\n\nOk so nothing I can do, or say, but sorry I was born in a country you dont like. (Here's a gun, use it as a toothpick you racist pig.)\n\nIn Closing;\n\nYou would think on the business side... here is a great repeat customer, legit to our requests, patient, and proved they had all securities in place, proven NO activity on the account from anyplace on the globe, and provided what we had and spent over the past year from their (WTF) own records... so lets give these items back to him and figure out where they went... but NO... not one reply had anything to do with our request. But because he from the USA... wow... just no words.\n\nWhile they have the \"loose one wont break the company\" mentality, those who supported their game and company for a year and still giving them a chance... with one complaint with legit backing and proof provided... and what did we get... A HUGE D*C* in the AS* with a side order of HUGE (Plenty of follow thru) SLAP then BEATING in our face! So after this for just a polite simple request that even had humor in it, and a proven complaint with legit screenshots and purchase information, there is nothing they can do or say to justifiy it as training as more than one CS agent in all our tickets repeated the same thing.\n\nNo excuse for reundant, pathetic abuse of people with proven legitimate complaints that were poilite, respectful and gave them everything and then some to their requests.  Sad it took us a year for our first problem to discover such terrible abuse! Dont find out what we did, it may not happen in a month or a year but if you have anything you need for your account, simple or extensive... good luck.. go talk into a fan and have someone pour acid thru the other side... it would at least give back! \n(ok.... dont really do it, no one should hurt themselves over these terrible people who f*ck people over daily man or woman)\n\nWARGAMING.net is where your money is appreciated and respected we have also supported for years as well... at least they are fair, read the complaints, share and compare facts and still even if you are found to be somewhat incorrect or interpret something incorrect, they take care of you, no issue, no hassle in my two prior problems in six years.\nActually they read out review and told us if that happened to us, we have a direct contact line, we fortuanately never have had to use to date. Still works too... yay.\n\n\n\n\nDiscalimer; The Review Crew's evaluations are based on paying close attention to forum response and activity, system demand, fun of the game genre, position of originality in respective genre, growth of the project in its current state at time of review, graphics as a whole for end user, presentation of the game and display, replayability, patch/tweak progress, beginner friendliness & gameplay direction, content & depth, attention to detail on small things(polish), lag and multiplayer application if applicable, badge card availability, with a minimum 8 hours of gameplay and interaction with customer base after release.

Well, an almost embarrassingly long time. Even prior to its release on steam I played this game nonstop for a number of months. It has only been in the last six or so months that the game has soured entirely. The developers, a delightful company based in Russia called Gaijin, used to put the highest focus on gameplay and balance. They listened to the community and actually handled feed back rather well. Yet, oddly, in the last several months they seem to have put their focus on more features, more glitter in their game. They have gotten rid of the community involvement in many of the groups that have formed around the game, most noteably Reddit. (The community manager with Gaijin was removed) The community as a whole has made countless attempts to bring issues with the game to the dev's attention and have repeatedly and consistently been ignored and in some cases players were banned for voicing their concerns. \n\nGame play wise, is this game fun? The answer to that question is, \"It can be.\" Every once in a while you might get that golden blue moon match where you're not being completely stomped by some fellow in a KV-2 and any of the heavy Russian tanks. It could be fun depending on what you drive/fly. If you prefer US tanks or planes, I wouldn't recommend trying. The Russian and German trees are a bit more enticing if you don't want to be clubbed. The main issue with the game right now is balance, or lack thereof.

No surprise the developers are russian. Their response to the bias is that they have \"Secret documents\" about WW2, probably saying Russia had magic infused armor made from Stalin's bumsweat and nosehair.\nTime and time again the community has provided declassified documents themselves, disproving the armor effectiveness and certain nerfs on especially germans, from MANY countries, even CCCP but devs/mods just ignore it/delete it.\n[b]I would also like to add that Steam moderators have CONFIRMED that russian bias exists about a month ago from writing this review.[/b]\n\n-Pay2Win\nCertain vehicles are behind a paywall going up to 60 euro a vehicle sometimes. These are blatantly better than their free counterparts on the same rating. Special armor, non-exploding fueltanks, the list goes on.\nBut most irritating are the rocketlaunching tanks. The Callioppe for instance has 60 rockets mounted ontop of a Sherman, each rocket is DEVASTATING for other tanks downright riddling the crew with shrapnel. Add to that a insanely high RoF and a 10 second reload speed. Also the rockets cannot be taken out by shooting the canisters. No surprise its a 50 euro tank.\n\n-Map Design\nPartially to blame for the russian bias is the map design. Most maps are made specifically for close range brawler tanks ( russian ) and aircombat always at a low enough altitude to \"justify\" the russian superiority as russian planes were best at low altitudes ( below 5 km ).\nSpawn camping is easily done as you only need to do a small drive of about 30 seconds on certain maps to be in enemy spawn. You have a brief spawnprotection but thats void as soon as you're alive for a few seconds. You drive out of spawn then and boom, someone shot you in your side who was hiding in a bush/behind a rock next to your spawn.\n\n-Battle Rating\nThe most agrivating and full on bias thing to exist in War Thunder.\nVehicles are classed by a Battle Rating ( BR ) as to balance the matches so a lategame heavy tanks wont face 1920's tanks. \nThis is broken, there is no way around it. \nRussian vehicles have favorable BR's to their opponents. Purposely classed lower than what theyre actually worth so they decimate other countries. ( Also outperforming specialised turnfighters with a flying russian brick and magic armor )\nHow it is supposed to work is your highest vehicle will be chosen and put into a match with +/-1 BR or 1.3 in planes. Seeing as i fight BR 3.3 tanks in my 1.3 tanks, I cannot kill anything.\n\n-Developers\nAs said earlier they are racist towards anything what isn't russian. Disregarding anyone not speaking russian as less important. Deleting and banning alot of feedback on their own forum and having Steammods delete any negative feedback. Steammods also actively downvote negative reviews reportedly.\nAlso I think Gaijin spies on what you say via bots as I myself have been banned from chat while ONLY talking in Squadchat with my friends, badmouthing Gaijin. 15 day chatban for hate messages. Only hate against Gaijin though.\nGiving russian vehicles magic abilities, nerfing all other countries to oblivion (mostly germans), banning and deleting community for feedback and having a MASSIVE P2W mentality with 50 euro blatantly overpowered vehicles.\n\nEdit: Gaijin forced a youtuber to delete a video he made with footage showing a hacker. They do not want the world to see they cannot handle hackers.\n\nShame Gaijin, shame.

Often you will put in matches that have landslide result or you will be fighting against tanks that are almost unbeatable by you. The maps are buggy and laid out poorly were you can snipe tanks in their spawn, shoot through hills, shoot through buildings and concrete walls but not a tree, and some maps are very biased toward one team. Ground forces also have planes that players can use with no penalty for dying in the aircraft. This means you can kamikaze into tanks as a bomber and kill them. \n\nIt also pisses me right the hell off that gajin would use p2p or torrenting to distribute updates to players while making it incredibly difficult to turn off p2p and use a http server. Not only is it a system that a professional company shouldn't be using, but in many cases the unorganized nature of the p2p protocol causes client networks to take a dump by not allowing other packets through.

I started playing 2-3 years ago, and even back then they didn't know what they were doing, but at least they seemed like they were trying. They listened to the community sometimes, but now... too many bad changes and patches that don't seem to be letting up any time soon. Now they refuse to listen to the community. The first 6 months are fun for some due to ignorance of the grand scheme of things in terms of issues, plus the early tier planes are the most fun, but after that it spirals quickly out of control and becomes not fun anymore. Even going back and playing the old planes isn't fun for me. The matchmaking changes have been horrible, and (as much as its overstated sometimes), there's a debatable Russian bias and they straight up retcon history sometimes.\n\nI love the game to death, it has so much potential, and there's nothing more that I would love to see than this game to become what it could be, but as long as its in the hands of such an unorganized and dysfunctional development team, that won't be happening any time soon. This game is the epitome of one of those FPS's that seem promising for the first few months, and then you realize how much of a grind it really is.\n\nIt's not even just the fact that it's a grind, it's not about taking forever to unlock planes, it's not about the fact that it will take the average user about a year to get their first jet, because it's possible to have fun in this game without jets. In fact, jets are one of the most unbalanced and un-fun parts of this game, besides ground forces. The early tiers are some of the most fun, in fact. That's why you so often see players with about 100 hours or less giving WarThunder positive reviews, yet as you go up through the hours, most of those players start giving negative reviews.\n\nThe real issues lie in the dev team's unwillingness to listen to the community, their horrid, horrid, HORRID mod team who watch over their forums like hawks and strike down almost all criticisms of the game with impunity, it lies in the fact that they've made some painfully obvious cash grabs in the game, like making it so you have to pay for country flags because \"teamkilling was an issue.\" Most of the community, if not all, wants the game to succeed. We offer criticisms and ways to fix the issues, they give us bans, longer grinds, and horrible BRs.\n\nThe dev team's unwillingness to not only fix the FM issues, but even their complete failure to acknowledge them, means that the game is doomed if it continues on the path it's currently on. BRs are complete trash, if you aren't flying the flavor of the month plane then you might as well not be flying. If you're not driving a Russian tank, you might as well not be driving.\n\nNow, because of Gaijin's failures, hundreds of veterans like me, and others with even more time in the game than me, are jumping ship. Not because we don't care about the game anymore, but because Gaijin doesn't. Its sad because most  bad review of this game is from a player who has played for a long time, and most of the good ones are from complete new users who are still able to enjoy the game before they realize how truly bad the situation is.\n\nThe nation balance is garbage. Japan gets screwed over soooooo much. Germany has been getting pounded on, or at least was last time I played, Russia has always had curbstomping abilities over the other nations, and the US flip flops depending on the tier. British are just everywhere. I personally stopped playing consistently about the time when ground forces started having the issue with the foliage, where you would be at a severe disadvantage (and I'm talking gamebreaking severe) if you kept your grass/foliage on. I have logged on a handful of times since, but only for 2-3 rounds and then I just get tired and sad. I want the game to be good. The sad thing is, though I have been playing for 2-3 even back then and through the years, I can never truly say the game has felt completely good. There have always been a number of broken FMs, the economy has gone through various levels of shit, one nation is always curbstomping another, etc. About the time they removed the 2x bonus, that's when the crashing spiral downward in quality started.\n\nGaijin's PR is horrible, especially with their whole \"guys, don't judge, we're still in beta\" excuse which has been a lie ever since you've been able to pay to get ahead in the game. It's been a lie ever since they started using it as an excuse to disregard their personal flaws and using it as a way to completely shift the blame from them over to the community. It's been a lie because most games in beta survey the userbase, asking for feedback, while Gaijin denies feedback at every opportunity. Ever since their PR team straight up quit the subreddit, calling it a \"toxic environment\", most likely due to the fact that they were unable to control what was said (unlike their forums, where they have total control and use that control freely), there was no hope for their PR team. A development team that will readily call their community, who offers criticisms and only wants to help the game get better (though I do concede that a lot of the players will get pissy after a bad patch, but who can really blame them?) isn't fit to run a game.\n\nI really do want this game to be good.

That's around 33% more xp, but vehicles are 600% more expensive. So you get millions of \"free\" xp, but it requires real life money to use.

I am still in disbelief that EVERY moderator has blown me off, with the exception of the one that replied just so he could call me a Nazi. His empty accusation isn't just offensive, but it's pathetic. I am not a Nazi and I never represented myself to be in any fashion, the mod simply formed an opinion based on my German username and refuses to believe anything different.

It had its problems, but it was fun. Over time, however.... Things change.\n\nThe state of the game now is... Alright. Mechanically, it's very good, aside from certian nations air rounds having more proclivity to \"spark\" (indicate a hit but do no damage) than others. However, balancing issues, along with a few bugs, remain present, and affect the game experience greatly. This alone wouldn't be enough for me to permanantly condemn the game, but Gaijin itself has also changed. Its stance towards the community has gone from acceptance, to outright ignorance, and seemingly insane greed. If you -do- get this game, never buy Golden Eagles. Their value is minimal at best these days.\n\nI could list the iunnumerable balance issues Gaijin has forced upon the game to further increase the time it takes to progress, and squeeze as much money out of you as possible, but there are plenty of people that do it much better than I can on a review. Just a suggestion, however; avoid any source that is attached to Gaijin itself. They do thier best to censor criticisms. And this is the main reason I cannot at all reccomend this game. If the company controlling it cannot bare to own up to thier own mistakes, I simply cannot see it progressing further than it has, let alone getting any better.\n\nIt's a shame, really...

This game is quite a solid platform, everything performs, mostly, as it should, and we're getting British Tanks soon. That's bound to appeal to more than one might imagine. The updates, for the most part? Reasonable. The amount of ridiculousness from those Yak-9s going through the roof? Yes, but this is why you get either a plane that can reasonably ensnare the little sky devils or go AAA if possible. Simulation is quite nice (Despite me sucking at them to an absolute degree), Realistic plays fine, and if you're not keen on either, Arcade will likely hold what you want. None of these are faulty.\n\nIt's the moderation base and the lack of caring that make me hit \"No\" on the recommendations panel. The worst bit? They'll silence you if you speak up against them about it. For God's sake, we're trying to help you, and you shoot us down like we're nothing but scrubs? And by the way, that is even if you pay. They don't care who you are, you'll get shut up, one way or another.\n\nAnother key problem is the graphics. ...what, you were expecting me to say Battle Rating? Find another review, they'll explain it. I personally find it hilarious when I gun down a plane with a BR higher than mine.\n\nLet's get this out of the way. Like the core gameplay, the core graphics are not an issue. Heck, they're some of the most beautiful to date. For those who play Realistic, I'm sure you'll agree with me on this if you play Ground Forces in Realistic or Simulator: There is an option within the game settings to turn the bushes OFF. Yeah, not down to a minimum, outright OFF. This is a huge problem that Gaijin refuses to fix, and it's impacting Realistic Ground Battles to this day. (And Simulator, but Realistic at the least) It's understandable for low-end PCs, but this is straight up an advantage for players who want to shoot you while you're not even able to see them if you have your bushes on.\n\nThis, and especially the lack of a caring development base, are what make me not recommend this game. If what it takes for me to change my mind is an administrative reform at Gaijin Entertainment, then so help me Arceus, do it.\n\n...on the flip side though, if you're just someone who just enjoys a good tank and plane game, once all this settles down, it's a good game.

Back in the Golden Age of War Thunder, there was only air battles, no tanks, no helicopters, and no ships. Of course there were flaws with the game like the economy, RP (\"research points\" to unlock new vehicles) gain and Silver Lion (main currency to purchase vehicles) gain, but despite these problems War Thunder was incredibly fun. Then Ground Forces were introduced to the game, grab a tank, queue up and duke it out. I was completely open to the idea of tanks being added to the game as long as it was done properly.\n\n[h1]How I Feel About War Thunder Now[/h1]\nPersonally I believe this game is slowly being killed by Gaijin Entertainment, a few months ago we had a major update, Update 1.81 \u201cThe Valkyries\u201d which adding many new helicopters, some top tier tanks which most people won't play unless they open the wallet, and 2 new planes for pilots, one of them just being nothing but a reskin. This is the first real bit of content plane pilots in the game have seen in a while. Air realistic battles or Air RB is probably the most popular game mode for planes which has been simply abandoned. There are flaws with it and many people try to let Gaijin know about these problems but they respond with an update releasing new premium tanks, and more top tier tanks which will take a new player an unbelievable amount of time to grind out. I like to think of Air RB as a former War Thunder YouTuber (theOrangeDoom) said is \"Gaijin's bastard child\", it has been forgotten. The game is unbelievably and unreasonably grindy without having to pay. If your response is \"well Gaijin's a company and they have to make money somehow\" your opinion just isn't wanted. There is a line that you don't cross where you're trying to make money to where you're trying to milk new players by keeping the hype train going and Gaijin have crossed it. A few days ago update 1.83 \"Masters of the Sea\" was released where ships and helicopters were put on the live server when a couple months ago they already released a major update. In my eyes Gaijin is just rushing updates to keep the hype train of more, and more, and more new content being released to drain new players of their money. Instead of fixing the problems they have they add more stuff, new tanks that you'll never be able to drive, ships that are just an absolute mess, and helicopters to go with that wonderful Challenger 2 or M1 Abrams that you'll never get unless you start filling their pockets while emptying yours.\n\n[h1]My Conclusion[/h1]\nWar Thunder, once a game full of youthful energy and passion, has become a destitute husk of what it once was. With horrifically rushed updates that milk both new and old players of their money and flashy trailers of content only few will ever obtain (without a credit card) it has twisted what was once a wonderful game, into a stagnant pay to progess more than it has ever been, shitpile masked with the face of a shiny modern vehicle.\n\n[h1]Update 1 - 2/16/2019[/h1]\nYesterday Gaijin released a development blog announcing Tier 7 and the Challenger 2. The problem with this is, there are an insane amount of holes in Tier 6 tanks, Tier 6 planes only came out a few months ago and Germany, Japan, Italy, and France are missing these aircraft. Not to mention the naval isn't finished due to Japan, Italy, and France not having these ships, also these four nations are lacking helicopters. It's like Gaijin is [b]trying[/b] to kill the game.\n\n[h1]Update 2 - 2/19/2019[/h1]\nOnce again as Gaijin does they rush content and already announced a new jet. Although aircraft are widely requested due to Gaijin barely giving any attention to pilots, maybe fixing the game and all of its glaring issues is more important at the moment.", "timestamp_created": 1540531389, "timestamp_updated": 1550570085, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 233, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.781459271907806396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18160422": {"recommendationid": "18160422", "author": {"steamid": "76561198090131922", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 73387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1537998533}, "language": "english", "review": "Last update is 120% bullshit, TY Gaijin go fu*k yourself", "timestamp_created": 1443023557, "timestamp_updated": 1443023557, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 328, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.716652035713195801", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35349606": {"recommendationid": "35349606", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065177843", "num_games_owned": 371, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 21913, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545861568}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR: Overwhelming amounts of grind, terrible forum moderation, developers completely out of touch with the player base, P2W.\n\nPreface: My Steam game time is not the representation of my experience with the game; I have been playing this game on and off since February 2013 and Gaijin somehow manages to make the game worse and worse with each update.

I admit. back then matchmaking was pretty unforgiving but the game was a lot of fun. It was easy to make credits, easy to progress, good times overall.\n\nThen, patch 1.29 came.

But because the earnings were still low, players were buying this plane called \"Dora\". High tier German fighter. Many players were playing it, which led to horrible matchmaking, where this plane would often get matched with low tier planes.. I remember facing it in my tier 4 Spitfire (the Dora was rank 13 at the time).\n\nNext patch remedied this somewhat, but they added this stupid feature called \"Battle trophies\". Basically a random chance to get some credits after a match. Pure randomness. Gaijin actually thought this was a good solution. \n\nSometime after that, they introduced upgrade system. This is where the \"World of Tankification\" started. Before this, planes had no upgrades save for two, which had a very tiny impact on the performance. But now, fully upgraded plane was about 30% more powerful than stock one. So you had to go back and grind out all of those upgrades if you wanted to be competitive. To be fair, we also got ammo belts in this update, but still - one step forward, two steps backwards.\n\nThen came the dreaded patch 1.37. Prior to this patch, you would gather XP into a big pool of 20 levels, after the bar was full, you would unlock a bunch of planes. With the new system, the progression was changed into 5 levels, where you have to unlock 6 planes of one level before you can move on. This made the grind about 4 times longer while devaluing the XP conversion for real money at the same time. Gaijin also lied to the players when they said you would be able to just go down one plane line (bombers, naval fighters, etc). This was not true, the only point of the new system was to get people to pay more money. This update was also accompanied by new matchmaking system called Battle Rating. Each plane has its BR value, which is determined not by plane performance, but by player performance in that plane. This is just as stupid as it sounds and even to this day, there are some hilariously under tiered planes. Such as premium P-47 that can actually go up against biplanes.\n\nThen, there were tanks. Of course, they introduced expensive packs for early access into the tanks.To be fair, this was the only time when the game was fairly balanced. And it was fun too - you only needed 2 tanks to advance to the next tier. \nAfter full tank release, the XP gain was really low compared to planes. Gaijin again lied about this - first they said the XP gain would be adjusted as more tanks are added, but it has remained the same to this day. Unlocking a tank tree takes about 4x longer than unlocking an air tree.\n\nThen there was the P2W. Tiger II is too good? Here's a T29! Only 40 dollars!\nOh, Soviets don't have any good heavy tanks? Here, IS-6! Only 40 dollars!\nOh no, the IS-6 is giving you hard time? Here's Ru-251! With ammo that can slice through the frontal armor! Only 40 dollars!\n\nThey also introduced Bushes for IRL currency. First, they costed 1000 GE (I think) for a pack of 6, then Gaijin claimed this was a sale and now they cost 500 GE per piece. Now, these bushed give you a pretty big advantage in battle - not because they make you harded to see, but because they hide your weak spots, which is a big deal in a game mode with no markers.\n\nThen they denied cheating was even possible in War Thunder, and when a youtuber uploaded a video of these cheats, they came out and said asked the community if they would rather have them ban anyone who mentions these cheats, or completely ruin the game mode by adding markers so that cheats are less effective. No word about combating these cheaters though. They have started banning them though, but people at Gaijin tend to be very dense.\n\n\nNow, the 1.71 patch. While it did nothing inherently bad, they introduced a new tier of tanks along with 50 dollar premium tanks (starting to see the pattern here?). This update is only for whales since 95% of the player base will never get to these tanks because of the intense grind required.\n\nThe forum mods are always on powertrip. They just keep making up stupid forum rules, so they have even more ways to ban you for criticism, disagreeing with moderation and even reporting bugs and making suggestions.\n\nBack to the grind in tanks - you need to research two separate modules if you want to put out fires and repair your tank in battle. Gaijin defended this with stupid claims such as  \"it creates tension\" and so on. Just to illustrate how stupid it is - imagine starting out with 50 health in CSGO and having to kill a certain amount of enemies before you can even have 100 health. And you would have to do the same before you could buy Kevlar vest and a helmet. Seriously - what other game has such a stupid mechanic?\n\nI have almost 300 battles in Leopard A1A1 and I still have not unlocked all the upgrades. And that is with a premium account.\n\nThe developers do not care about what the community wants - they will make the game they want to make, and hopefully it will be the same game players will want to play.\n\nThe graphics and core game play are both very nice, but that is not enough to save War Thunder.\n\nUnfortunately, this game is merely a shadow of its former self - the best time to play was 3 years ago. Now they are just milking the player base as much as they can.\n\nOverall verdict - 5/10. Do not play this for more than a few hours, and certainly do not spend any money.

Combined with the sheer amount of broken Features and the dismissal behaviour of Gaijin to Community Feedback, in addition to their Soviet-/Cold War Mentality made me stop Playing the Game a long Time ago.\n\n[h1]The Grind[/h1]\n\nBarely noticeable at low Level Vehicles it will soon begin to get ridiciulous at Mid to High Era Planes where some unlockable Modules will cost more RP than most of the Era 3-4 Planes.\nStarting with Patch 1.31, Gaijin continiously reduced the Credit/RP income which forces you at some point to buy a Premium Account and/or overpriced Premium Vehicles. \n\nBtw: Don\u00b4t bother to convert your Free RP via Gold as the Conversion Rate isn\u00b4t worth your Money (1:45 Ratio)\n\n[h1]Battle Ratings[/h1]\n\nThe Battle Rating System was originally designed to replace the Static 20-Tier System but made the Gameplay with every new major Patch procedural worse as more and more Vehicles are compressing the BR Brackets, resulting in Mid-WW2 Planes sealclubbing Pre-WW2 Biplanes or Korean War Jets clubbing late WW2 Prop Planes.

Many of those Mods often resort to trolling and outright abusing their Powers against regular Players. Even Youtuber/Streamer are affected.\n\n[h1]Historical Accuracy and Balance[/h1]\n\nTo give them Credit, Gaijin manages to recreate Aircraft/Tank Models with great Details but that\u00b4s it.

Most of these were applied to Non-Russian Vehicles. At the same time, many Russian Vehicles recieved considerable buffs (the Best example being Post-War Ammunition added to T-34/T-44/IS-2 Tanks).\n\nThis Russian Bias - which is constantly being denied by Gaijin - killed the Game for many of the Players.\n\n\n\ntl;dr - I can\u00b4t recommend this Game anymore", "timestamp_created": 1464468565, "timestamp_updated": 1464469197, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 194, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.763572216033935547", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23146138": {"recommendationid": "23146138", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001279867", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 19488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1519846434}, "language": "english", "review": "So I come from an era of War Thunder when it was not yet on Steam. I think this was around version 1.21\nThe game was extremely fun. Ofcourse, since it was Beta it contained a lot of bugs and imbalanced planes (it was only planes back then), some of which were fixed within the week or month, others that are still not fixed today. But all was okay and the community was very relaxed so to speak.\n\nNow you got to understand one thing, War Thunder at the time had around 20 tiers, that was perfectly balanced for every plane out there and matchmaking could very much handle it the way it should but all of a sudden within a few patches they changed the Tier 20 system to a ridiculous Tier 5 system, a system that even up till today takes way more hours of grinding to get the next plane than it was ever before. Now that they hightened the grinding levels was understandable in a way because some people could grind to the latest Tiers within a few days/weeks, so they had to level it out for the whole game and paid players.\n\nBut oh boy, that is also where the poo hitted the fan, because their matchmaking system, which used to be somewhat flawless now was utter crap that used \"BR ratings\" to set you up with others and even up till today people find ways to abuse this system and get with extremely good vehicles in games agains people with extremely bad vehicles. It just doesnt make any sense.\n\nOh yeah and up untill today, they still have not fixed a lot of bugs. One of which that is very bad for a game like this, hit detection. If you fire up to 20 bullets from a plane, the connection can make it so that you only hit the other plane with 5 or 10 of them, while on your screen it can look like you hitted it with 15 or even all 20 bullets.\n\nPlease stay clear of this game, but if you really want to play it, do not give/pay any money untill they do something about all the bad things.", "timestamp_created": 1463952720, "timestamp_updated": 1463952720, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 134, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.6931723952293396", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33999156": {"recommendationid": "33999156", "author": {"steamid": "76561197965384825", "num_games_owned": 923, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 15821, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515594655}, "language": "english", "review": "Game is great but Gaijin traes its customers like garbage, my account got hacked from Russia (as they happens often to hundreds of accounts in batches), we caught this in minutes the hacker just spent all my golden eagles in stupid stuff.

The fact that T34 goes for about 30km/h on a terrain is just simple BS. it couldn't go above 15 km/h in terrain due to crappy transmittion. And to shift to 4.th gear you would need some sort of superhuman power. The fact that every russian plane can catch up to US plane is BS aswell.
