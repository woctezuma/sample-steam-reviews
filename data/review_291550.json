was actively playing it there.\n\nAfter playing this game for about 1000 hrs between PC, PS4, and other peoples accounts I cannot recommend this game.\n\nThe ranked gameplay quickly falls apart as you get higher and higher in ranks and becomes a passive wait fest where the first person to attack loses because the mechanics favor reactive and not engaging game play. I watched my average kill/death time go from 35 seconds in my first season playing to about 1:30 now.\n\nThe developers really don't seem to understand how to balance the game and it's basically just revolving rounds of fix X and break Y. This was particularly frustrating when they decided that dodge mechanics needed to change to favor running away rather than dodging through attacks. Even more frustrating was then they decided that noone was playing heavy weapons because they were too slow so they just jacked up the speed on high damage weapons without pairing that with something to not make them overpowered. Now on the low levels you get players spamming heavy weapons that cover huge hitboxes and on the high levels you get people using small weapons and waiting for other people to attack first.\n\nI would recommend the casual gameplay as people don't tend to 'play to win' there but alas that's where all of the toxic ranked players go to let off steam and just ruin the fun for casual players.

P2P is still the better method for fighting games tho.\n[*]The weapon system. It's kind of cool that you can mix two playstyles into one character, and it's not seen on other platform fighters.\n[*]Up to 8 people can play in online multiplayer mode.\n[*]lobby system, with alternate party modes available.\n[/list]\n\nNegatives:\n[list]\n[*]Floaty, clunky, brainless gameplay. Absolutely no techs whatsoever apart from \"gravity cancel\", which is just a spotdodge in the air to use grounded attacks. Wanted to wavedash, waveland, L cancel, DI? Nothing of that here, enjoy floaty physics with infinite ledge hugging that allows for lame, campy gameplay.\n[*]The weapon system. While it's on its core a fresh idea, it spawns lazyness when it comes to character design and variety. A sword won't ever be \"Bodvar's epic sword\", because that same sword plays exactly the same in every other character that has a reskinned sword.\n[*]Character variety. While every character has in theory their own smashes (a.k.a \"sigs\") there is absolutely nothing distinctive about any of them. Sidesig is big hitbox to the side,  Neutralsig is big hitbox up, downsig is big hitbox either on the ground, or a leaping attack. That's it. No character has a signature that interacts with the environment, nor with other mechanics, because there's no other mechanic to begin with. Every character has the same weight, the same hitbox, the only thing that changes between them are the weapon choices and the strength/speed/defense/dexterity multipliers.\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1551402334, "timestamp_updated": 1551402334, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519685029983520508", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49043510": {"recommendationid": "49043510", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243968026", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 29976, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 964, "last_played": 1551668557}, "language": "english", "review": "it sucks.", "timestamp_created": 1550371552, "timestamp_updated": 1550371552, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49043894": {"recommendationid": "49043894", "author": {"steamid": "76561198262224686", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9563, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 52, "last_played": 1551389324}, "language": "english", "review": "Hi, I'm the developers, I'm going to sellout and make this game worse with every major update!", "timestamp_created": 1550373611, "timestamp_updated": 1550373611, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49345317": {"recommendationid": "49345317", "author": {"steamid": "76561198094147000", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 22, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 22, "last_played": 1551652912}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a REALLY bad knockoff of Smash Bros.

If you just play Brawlhalla with your friends and never take it seriously, you will likely enjoy yourself. However, if you ever get good at this game and play at a decently high level, Brawlhalla's glaring failures as a fighting game will become so unignorable that your desire to play it will steadily decline till you're on the subreddit crying about the passive float meta like everyone else. All of the reviews - including the negative ones - are ignoring the real problems with this game, and it's something I have thought about for a long time. So, I'll try to explain my reasoning as best as I can and briefly include the reasons why I still consider it worth downloading despite its enormous flaws.\n \nOn the surface, Brawlhalla is an entertaining party game, provided you have some friends to play it with. So, if the only thing you're looking for is a simple game to kill some time (read: 1500 hours) with, download it. It is very easy to play and you are practically guaranteed to pick it up quickly regardless of your fighting game experience. Aside from being easy to play, it is also free to play and only cosmetic items cost money, so it is easy to get into as well. There are a good number of modes for you to play with your friends to prevent it from getting stale. You can level up your characters and unlock new colors for each few levels, so there is some degree of progression and playing a lot of one character can feel slightly rewarding. It also helps that a potato could likely run this game.\n \nWhile I do consider this game's positives enough to make it worth downloading, that\u2019s just about all the positivity I have to share. As someone who has played and seen this game played at a very high level for many hours, I can confidently say that Brawlhalla is a fundamentally flawed mess. I'm not going to complain about the toxic community, or the netcode, or matchmaking, or any of the stuff you see other reviews complaining about. I'm only going to talk about the game's core mechanics and why it fails competitively.\n \nBrawlhalla has a dodge mechanic that grants virtually instant invincibility and makes you unhittable for nearly half a second. Dodging has very low risk because it has only 0.97 seconds of downtime and it is difficult to punish unless your opponent can predict exactly where you will dodge. You can dodge in 8 directions at any given time, and if you are running you can dodge twice in succession. When the iframes from the dodge end, you are able to jump or attack almost immediately, which is one of the main reasons why it\u2019s so ridiculously safe. You can also jump in any direction 3 times, and once you're in the air you can quickly fall to the ground to get all your jumps back and continue hopping around. This combination of instant invincibility on a 1 second cooldown and an insane amount of aerial freedom results in a passive, floaty meta where playing optimally means avoiding making any approaches. Usually, making the first attack means risking being punished, whereas dodging or floating away is safe and can potentially put you in a position to punish a whiffed attack. Because of this, it often feels like you\u2019re chasing your opponent rather than fighting them. Seriously, playing this game feels like you're in space with how effortlessly you can float around and avoid your opponent. Constantly approaching will get you killed faster than a lone cripple in a collapsing, burning building. Sometimes, salty players will run away from you in ranked just to troll you and you will have a very hard time catching them. Yes, this is a problem with the community, but it shouldn\u2019t be possible in the first place. A key reason this happens is because dodging is a stupidly easy way to escape pressure. Any time you get hit you can just dodge in one of eight directions and reset the match to the neutral phase. Brawlhalla\u2019s neutral phase is reminiscent of two kids hopping around on a jungle gym endlessly until one kid falls and hurts themselves (in this case, hurting yourself would be equivalent to approaching).\n \nAnother issue that ties into dodging and movement is wall camping. It\u2019s possible to wall camp almost endlessly and force your opponent into a disadvantage if they want to approach. Players have won tournament matches by abusing this. A mechanic was introduced that stops you from getting your jumps back after touching the wall too many times, but it's rather forgiving and you only need to touch the stage for a few frames before you can resume wall camping. Once you get comfortable with movement in this game, it\u2019s incredibly easy to dance around on the wall for as long as you want.\n \nIf you\u2019re reading this and you don\u2019t play Brawlhalla, you might be thinking that all the problems I\u2019ve listed thus far could be addressed by nerfing dodge in some capacity. Unfortunately, the entirety of Brawlhalla has already been crafted and balanced around this awful mechanic. Certain weapons are better at punishing dodges than others, with some weapons capable of dealing massive damage on a precise dodge read. A considerable dodge nerf would mean that these weapons would benefit immensely and quickly become meta. The only way I can imagine this game\u2019s passivity problem being fixed would be a colossal rework of dodging, jumping, and probably every weapon in the game as well. Understandably, the developers don\u2019t know what that rework should be and how to conduct it. They\u2019re trying to fix the game\u2019s passive float meta by applying band aid fixes that ultimately do very little to address the huge, overarching passivity problem Brawlhalla has always had. \n \nThe other day, I told myself I was going to play ranked with the only intention being to win, which meant playing fully passive and not caring what people thought of me. I quickly reached top 50 in the world doing this. Almost nobody gged me and plenty of people complained about my playstyle in post game chat. Admittedly, although I am never toxic to anyone regardless of how they play, I don't blame a single one of those people for their anger. Brawlhalla, when played at a high level, is legitimately one of the most frustrating fighting games to play in existence. Just imagine losing to someone after they avoided approaching you, wall camped, or outright ran away from you for the entire game. Considering this, it\u2019s no wonder why Brawlhalla\u2019s community is a cesspool of toxicity and noxious, salty fumes.\n \nAs much as I want to give this game a negative review, I cannot justifiably do so. Most people who play this game will stay at a basic, casual level and never even notice or be forced to encounter the serious passivity problem this game has. So, despite my frustration with Brawlhalla, I am giving it a positive review. My recommendation would be to play with your friends and avoid taking this game too seriously. However, the prevalence of the passive float meta is noticeable as early as high platinum/low diamond, so be very forewarned and prepared to deal with it if you intend to play this game for many hours. As for myself, unless this game takes a drastically different direction, it is unlikely that I will be playing it for much longer.\n\nEDIT: Not sure if anybody still views this, but I'll briefly explain why I don't believe dash fixed the core problem discussed in the review. First of all, by replacing directional grounded dodging, dash reinforces the passive meta by making it far easier to punished a whiffed attack (and allowing you to do so in situations where you wouldn't have been able to reach them beforehand). A simple but effective passive technique is constantly backdashing to bait a whiffed approach, which is nearly impossible to punish since dash (regardless of the direction) can be canceled with anything instantly.", "timestamp_created": 1498073762, "timestamp_updated": 1542142681, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 716, "votes_funny": 24, "weighted_vote_score": "0.946977674961090088", "comment_count": 43, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33964499": {"recommendationid": "33964499", "author": {"steamid": "76561198105639920", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 52, "playtime_forever": 6017, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529451492}, "language": "english", "review": "Throwing the gun gives you more range than actually firing it.", "timestamp_created": 1501653648, "timestamp_updated": 1501653648, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 129, "votes_funny": 202, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894564568996429443", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "35800902": {"recommendationid": "35800902", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052005184", "num_games_owned": 234, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 236342, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2638, "last_played": 1551799343}, "language": "english", "review": "I have played this game to death, and I love and I hate it. \nThat said, there isn't a game on steam I could recommend to you more.\n\nI've been with the game for almost two years competing at a pro level, participating in tournaments and attending LAN events. During this time the game has seen it's ups, and its downs. Ultimately, due to its amateur but dedicated and communicative dev team \"BMG\", it has come out on top!\n\nThere's definitely two sides to Brawlhalla: The casual, and the competitive.\n\nThe former I don't have much experience with but I know that if I hop into some custom games with friends I can still have a great laugh even after all this time. The latter, oh man. The competitive community is fresh, young and enthusiastic. It's everything someone looking to get into competitive gaming / self-improvement could want. \n\n-The game is easy to jump right into, but has a well rounded set of fighting game dynamics. \n\n-It doesn't look too pretty, but it plays very cleanly (with some of the best netcode I've EVER SEEN), as well as supporting a huge variety of characters and weapons.\n\n-It is a young game and the meta progresses slowly, but there is more room for you as an individual to make an impact. It is NOT EVEN CLOSE to too late to get into the game.\n\n-L A N, the community that gathers at our offline events is one of the best, hands down. I've had some of my best experiences IN MY LIFE at these events.\n\nWith a cosmetic-only business model (and a sweet art team), there is no reason not to at least TRY this game. If you're a competitive person but haven't found the right game for you, hop on the ranked ladder and if it doesn't get your blood boiling, doesn't do it for you, well it was free anyway!\n\nNow I'm going back to practice more Brawlhalla because, in case you didn't know, the world championship is on November 3rd, and has a $100,000 prize pool. :)", "timestamp_created": 1508262622, "timestamp_updated": 1508318333, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.836579382419586182", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43476803": {"recommendationid": "43476803", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052855362", "num_games_owned": 120, "num_reviews": 39, "playtime_forever": 32685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 453, "last_played": 1551497186}, "language": "english", "review": "Rules of Brawlhalla\nCrappy Internet = Instant lose\nBad at game = Lose to spammers\nGood at game = Lose to smurfs\nUnbalanced heroes = Lose\nBad keyboard = Lose\nBad teammate = Lose\nFFA as a platinum = Lose to noobs\nFFA as noob = Spam, but still lose\n\nWins 10 in row, doesn't rank up\nLoses twice, deranks.", "timestamp_created": 1531368576, "timestamp_updated": 1531368576, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 132, "votes_funny": 186, "weighted_vote_score": "0.839387178421020508", "comment_count": 20, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44375231": {"recommendationid": "44375231", "author": {"steamid": "76561198046581701", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 117141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549641470}, "language": "english", "review": "Chernobyl nuclear disaster aftermath had less toxicity than this game.", "timestamp_created": 1535225119, "timestamp_updated": 1535225119, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 45, "votes_funny": 128, "weighted_vote_score": "0.795926511287689209", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46686512": {"recommendationid": "46686512", "author": {"steamid": "76561198437840767", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 48, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543017872}, "language": "english", "review": "im gay", "timestamp_created": 1543017013, "timestamp_updated": 1543017013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 366, "votes_funny": 185, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829255640506744385", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29247625": {"recommendationid": "29247625", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984664130", "num_games_owned": 199, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 118518, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1450, "last_played": 1551810173}, "language": "english", "review": "Heard about this game from a friend.

Brawlhalla is subject to change.\n\nBrawlhalla is a dream come true for some gamers. Fans of Smash Bros have always had to turn to a console to sate their chaotic filled tendencies. Brawlhalla finally brings things to the PC/Mac and makes it readily available to everybody. The combat is fantastic, music well done, each character feels defined. It offers multiple game modes, couch co-op, single player and possibly more on the horizon. Brawlhalla seems like indeed something that did come from the heavens and is here to answer all your prayers. However, like most things that are too good to be true, there is something going on underneath the surface. Perhaps a venus flytrap of gaming if you will, showing you its tasty gaming nectar and then eating you whole. What am I talking about? Let's go on a little journey.\n\nThe core of the gameplay is exactly what you want it to be. 4 player brawling action is brought to you with a multitude of character choices. Now unlike that \"other\" game, these characters aren't perhaps as well known. Matter of fact if you asked me their names, I couldn't tell you. There is the robot guy, ninja girl, alien dude, minotaur man, pirate guy. You get the idea. It's not that these characters are not unique, matter of fact they each look very different and are very well animated. Just for the most part it really isn't that big a deal when you break things down.\n\nEach character comes with a set of two weapons and different statistical choices, ranging from strength, defense, and speed. Now each weapon itself has a certain power set, the rocket lance can blast you forward, the guns obviously have a ranged aspect to them, the hammer is slow but powerful etc. Characters share these items, the only thing that changes is the style in which the power-attacks are presented. While aesthetically this works, your character choice really doesn't change all too much when it comes to combat. I was just as good with ninja girl/sword then I was with pirate/sword. There are some attacks that are very different and then there are some that are exactly the same. The fact the characters are all more or less the same doesn't take away from the game too much. The combat is still fast, reactive, and fun. Just keep in mind the weapon sets are more important then the character flavor itself. Predicting what your enemies bring to table also is difficult because the ability to change your stats, this adds and takes away a little bit from the tactical nature of the Brawl style game.\n\nFrom there we launch into the levels and chaos ensues. The levels themselves are designed fairly well but nothing too exciting, mostly platforms in different positions. One level did feature moving platforms. I felt the levels need a dose of personality, hazards, traps, something to make them stylized and make them feel like as much of a character as the one you choose. Everything does blend well, the characters feel like they fit with the levels art style and everything flows well with the combat. The game controls easily, but it is probably is preferential to play with a controller, luckily the game does feature full controller support/rebindable keys.\n\nDetails of the game are fairly well polished as well. Music is high paced and decent, matching the style and themes of the game, although it is nothing too memorable. Thankfully it doesn't get repetitive. Sound effects are perfect and add that oomph you want when something explodes or when you crack someone really hard. Game modes are varied, although there isn't a story mode yet. You have a tournament mode, online, and even some in-game mini-games. This I liked quite a bit and would love to see it expanded upon. The options menu is a tiny bit lacking at this current moment in development but hopefully that will change.\n\nSo everything sounds great right? I would agree with you. Brawlhalla is a well done, action packed, competent game on Early Access. Lacking in bugs and online multiplayer is working well.(If you're US based.) Here is the catch, this is closed beta. Meaning that this game is eventually going to open up to everybody. Which means that Brawlhalla will be Free to play.(FTP) Which means one terrible and dreadful thing exists in the underbelly of this game. Microtransactions.\n\nMallhalla as its known, is the shop where you can buy all sorts of digital goodies. Now let me say I am not against Microtransactions. IF they are done right. I understand developing a game is not cheap and that there are bills to be paid and families to be fed. I am perfectly fine with everything on sale in the shop as well, all of it is cosmetic. Where Mallhalla begins to scare me is the huge gap between Taunts and Redeem Code. That could easily be filled with Characters, Weapons, and Levels. Which means you could be barred from using a new weapon set or new level, new character etc. There are plenty of ways that could all go sideways. Suddenly this goes from a fun brawl game, to pay me money to play with this toy. That might not be the case at all but it's something that should be kept in mind.\n\nThe prices of the micro-transactions themselves are also a bit wonky, if you ask me. Mammoth coins cost anywhere from $2.99 for 60 to $49.99 for 1000. With skins costing on average 140 coins that places the actual retail price at a whooping $7.00. That is quite a bit for a skin.(Although this isn't unusual in FTP games) While prices are not final and may change, this is still a scary example of things that are in the game right now. Start throwing in new characters and new weapon sets. Which undoubtedly will be higher priced then skins, suddenly this is a very expensive game.\n\nNow the developer has mentioned there will be an in-game currency that can purchase the items in the shop. Those have yet to be implemented at this point in development.\n\nBrawlhalla is a promising game, one that I hope doesn't fall prey to greed or bad decisions. It is not a clone of its inspiration and competition. Deviating in some features/mechanics that are for better or worse, Brawlhalla captures that one magic element, fun filled chaos. Giving you massive amounts of replay and letting you play with your friends. The game has a bright future, long as that mico-transaction element is handled carefully and they listen to their community.\n\nI will keep a watchful eye on Brawlhalla as development continues and it moves into open beta. More servers are added to expand the multiplayer. There are still many things that can be improved upon and hopefully those prices change a little bit. The little Smash player inside of me is optimistic, I hope he doesn't get knocked out of the board in one smash.", "timestamp_created": 1435201241, "timestamp_updated": 1435201249, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.779987871646881104", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "40140555": {"recommendationid": "40140555", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052374086", "num_games_owned": 223, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521521514}, "language": "english", "review": "- - -[ Audience: ] - - -\n\n\u2611 Kids\n\u2611 Everyone\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\n- - - [ Graphics/Animation: ] - - -\n\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Really bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2611 OK\n\u2610 Good \n\u2610 Beautiful\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\n- - - [ Price/quality: ] - - -\n\n\u2611 Free\n\u2610 Full price\n\u2610 Wait for sale\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Refund it if you can\n\u2610 Don't do it\n\n- - - [ Requirments: ] - - -\n\n\u2611  90' PC\n\u2611  Minimum\n\u2610 Medium \n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 High end \n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n- - - [ Difficulty: ] - - -\n\n\u2611 You just need 2 arms \n\u2610 Ez\n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master \n\u2610 Hard (first few hours)\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n- - - [ Game time/length ] - - -\n\n\u2610 Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n\u2610 Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n\u2610 Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n\u2610 Long ( 12+ hours)\n\u2611 Endless\n\n- - - [ Story] - - -\n\n\u2611  It doesn't have\n\u2610 Still better than Twilight\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\n- - - [ Bugs ] - - -\n\n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Bugs destroying the game\n\u2610 Lot of bugs\n\u2610 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2611 Nothing (I've seen)\n\n- - - [ Others: ] - - -\nMultiplayer: Yes \nSingleplayer: Yes?

The weapon system however isn't flawless and although I like the idea of a character having 2 optional weapons they all function the same besides three special moves that resemble smash attacks from smash bros, you have up/neutral, forward and downwards which is about the only differences between characters besides choice of weapon. Overall though, this game is a lot of fun to play and if you do need a smash alternative to play with friends out of either not wanting to emulate smash and play through netplay or just not owning a Wii U/3DS this game is definitely worth getting.", "timestamp_created": 1449009387, "timestamp_updated": 1449009387, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784996211528778076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "21217141": {"recommendationid": "21217141", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042403860", "num_games_owned": 134, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 35487, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 4, "last_played": 1550969453}, "language": "english", "review": "Although it seems unfair, it's actually amazingly balanced. In almost all ranks there is little to no difference in success with legends, all that matters is skill and practice. And even in the higher ranks where balance makes more of a difference, it's still completely possible to do well with any legend.\n\nSure the community isn't that great on the lower ranks, and spamming can get really annoying, but after you get past silver theres a huge improvement. Spamming doesn't get you to diamond, and if you try you will get stopped in your tracks in gold. The community outside of bronze, like on reddit or twitch, is really great and not very toxic. Most people are just nice people that would love helping out new people or just talk about the game. If you're looking to improve, you can just head over to twitch and observe, or ask for help.\n\nAnother great thing about this game is that there is no pay-to-win bullshit hidden inside. You can unlock every character without spending a cent, and theres a new free legend rotaion every week. Daily quests help people rake in more cash, and if you want you can spend money to get some cool bling to show off like skins or taunts, which have no effect to the gameplay whatsoever.\n\nBMG is a great company and puts a lot of love into the game, and you can really tell. Every week they have a stream where they show off things in development, and another one where they just play with viewers. There are raffles in both where you can win community colors, which is a color palette that is only obtainable through giveaways (again, no effect on the game). They really do listen to the community, and they hang out at the subreddit a lot and read most of the posts there.\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's super fast-paced and fun, even if you don't even know what you're doing. There are a couple different game types, and you can have up to 8 players in one game for complete chaos. You can either join with a friend and play 2v2 ranked, or go alone in 1v1. It's a little floaty, but there's nothing really wrong with that. You can jump around all the time or stay on the ground, whatever you want. There are light and heavy attacks for both ground and air, so neither one has a distinct advantage. As I said before, this game is actually extremely balanced, and in pretty much anything below diamond, everything is 99% balanced.\n\nSo in short yes I would reccomend this game.\n\nbut bring cassidys cupcakes back 0/10 until then", "timestamp_created": 1455485110, "timestamp_updated": 1479936401, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818822145462036133", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "39525268": {"recommendationid": "39525268", "author": {"steamid": "76561198143778780", "num_games_owned": 38, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 7566, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1532352813}, "language": "english", "review": "===[ Audience: ]=== \n\u2610 Kids\n\u2610 Everyone\n\u2611 Casual players\n\u2611 Pro players\n\n===[ Graphics: ]=== \n\u2610 Potato\n\u2610 Really bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 OK\n\u2611  Good \n\u2610 Beautiful \n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\n===[Price/quality: ]=== \n\u2611 Full price \n\u2610Wait for sale \n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Refund it if you can\n\u2610 Don't do it\n\n===[ Requirments: ]=== \n\u261090' PC\n\u2610 Minimum\n\u2611 Medium \n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 High end \n\u2610 NASA computer\n\n===[ Difficulty: ]=== \n\u2610 You just need 2 arms \n\u2610 Ez\n\u2611  Easy to learn / Hard to master \n\u2610 Hard (first few hours)\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n\n===[ Game time/length (N/A) ]=== \n\u2610 Really short ( 0 - 2 hours)\n\u2610 Short ( 2 - 8 hours)\n\u2610 Few hours ( 8 - 12 hours)\n\u2610 Long ( 12+ hours)\n\u2610 Endless\n\n===[ Story] === \n\u2611 It doesn't have\n\u2610 Still better than Twilight\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Fantastic\n\n===[ Bugs ]=== \n\u2610 Game itself is one big BUG\n\u2610 Bugs destroying the game\n\u2610 Lot of bugs\n\u2611 Few Bugs\n\u2610 You can use them for speedrun\n\u2610 Nothing\n\n\u265b Overall: 7/10 for casul, 8/10 if you take the hours to really enjoy it.", "timestamp_created": 1516585058, "timestamp_updated": 1516585058, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 123, "votes_funny": 32, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809052228927612305", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14255077": {"recommendationid": "14255077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198059700237", "num_games_owned": 420, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 33141, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1525747796}, "language": "english", "review": "PLEASE NOTE: This review is no longer being updated, as I do not play Brawlhalla as often as I once did. However, it is still a great game and I reccommend it 100%\n\nWell, let's talk about Brawlhalla for a sec, shall we?\n\nAt first glance it would seem as though it's a PC game going for the style of Smash Bros. On the 10th or so glance, it seems as though it's a PC game going for the style of Smash Bros. But with a few twists that keep it mostly seperate.\n\nFirst of all is the [b][u]weapon system.[/u][/b] I personally LOVE this mechanic. You start off with your weak melee attacks until you pick up a weapon, displayed on-screen as a generic sprite. When that happens, you get a non-generic weapon. Each character has a combination of two weapons that they can recieve. There's guns, spears, hammers, 1 sword, 2 swords, and a rocket lance. That's right, a rocket lance. Though each weapon is not exclusive to their characters, each character has 2 exclusive moves (1 per weapon) that they can use. Each weapon is VERY nicely balanced, and I'll talk more about that later.\n\nThere are also [b][u]items[/u][/b] you can pick up, though variety is sparce. There are spiky balls called Mace-Balls, which you throw at enemies. There are land mines, which you can either throw at your opponent(s) or at the walls and floors. Finally, there are plain ol' bombs that will make you stare in disbelief as you fly off into your doom after some dick throws one at you.\n\n[b][u]Online play.[/u][/b] I'm a little... eh about the quality of the online play at the moment. On one hand, it's incredible to wreck people online and tell them \"gg\" before having all of them ragequit, (Seriously, check out my Brawlhalla screenshots, I have that one in there somewhere) there is a lot of lag sometimes. On one hand, some matches can be as smooth as offline play, on the other hand some can involve unforseen game mehanics such as teleportation and death by \"I swear that guy was on the other side of the map .01 seconds ago\". [u]Despite this, the developers have stated repeatedly they are constantly working on improving online play. They have had multiple lag fix patches already and more are to come.[/u] So, that'll make the game even better.\n\n[b][u]Offline play[/u][/b] is so fun. There's a tournament mode where you play against CPUs to be the ultimate champion. The CPUs are pretty easy themselves, but the challenge lies in not getting killed while gathering many kills to get a high score. There is a star rating out of 5 you get at the end, with 5 being pretty difficult to acheive (SPOILER: There's a practically impossible rating to get that's above 5 stars... No more hints as to what it is) Also, there's local play where you can play with up to four people using controllers, and one person can use the keyboard or keyboard-mouse. No LAN unfortunately. The last thing is training mode. I won't go too much into detail with this, but imagine Smash Bros' training mode + damage per hit shown, visible hitboxes, and hitstun visibility.\n\n[b][u]The balance.[/u][/b] Outstanding. Though this could also be a statement as to the lack of variety, you could almost press random in a tournament match and come out the victor with anyone you got. Of course, it's not perfect. But unlike some other games, which have tier lists from SS all the way down to F or even G, Brawlhalla's tier list is more like an SS to A. [b]EDIT:]/b] There have been some updates since I wrote this review. There have been several balance changes which have wrecked the balance. First Gnash was broken, and was all you would see on Ranked 1v1. Then they patched that, but in the process broke hatorri who is now far beyond any character in ranking. This slightly lowers my rating from what it was. Edit: This game has frequent patches. It's in a good spot right now I'd say :)\n\nWait, did I say \"[b][u]tournament match[/u][/b]\"? Yes, Brawlhalla has a [b][u]competitive community[/u][/b] that even now, in closed beta, is over [strike]100[/strike] erm, times have changed. Make that 50,000+ strong. This is when the game isn't publicly available, and there's over [strike]100[/strike] 50,000+ people participating in competitive play. Think about that for a moment. Sure the game has been given away in many places already, but still. As I write this even, I am procrastinating much needed sleep for a Brawlhalla tournament tommorow.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n-Great brawler in the style of Smash Bros\n-Good offline mode\n-Has an online mode\n-Near impeccable balance\n-Growing competitive community\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n-Online mode can be VERY laggy at times\n-I can't beat Raidhyn\n-No LAN play\n-A little empty (Probably just a closed beta problem)\n-Many characters are kind of similar\n\n[h1]Not sure if PRO or CON:[/h1]\n-Very limited variety on items\n-Similar enough to Smash Bros to almost be called a ripoff. Not quite though.\n\n\n[h1]OVERALL VERDICT:[/h1]\n9/10 game, for being in beta.\nIf this was the finished product, I'd give it an 7.5 or 8/10.\nVery much reccomend this, as it's free to play. I've gotten REALLY into it.\n\nTLDR: Brawlhalla is a great game and it's free. You like brawlers you'll love Brawlhalla.

It's quite similar to Super Smash Bros, which is a game that many people enjoy, myself included. You pick a character with a simple weaponset consisting of two weapons. The weapons include spears, katars, scythes, swords, gauntlets, blasters, axes, bows, hammers, and cannons. My personal main, Wu Shang, utilizes gauntlets and spears.\n\nAfter choosing your character, you'll enter the game. You'll notice that the characters have both light attacks and heavy attacks, or signature attacks, which you can use in chain combos. Each character has original signature moves; no two legends are the same.\n\nWith the basics out of the way, you'll probably find yourself having some fun in a simple matchmaking or bot game. You'll play a few rounds, get a grip on what you're doing, and log off for a while, having enjoyed some harmless fun on an innocent looking game.\n\nThe game has a great art style and a great soundtrack, I'll give it that. You can tell the developers made an attempt to make a game that could be enjoyed by everybody.\n\nWell, try not to let these first impressions impact you to hard. Past the surface, this game and its community are on a whole new level of toxicity, chaos, and general despair. In fact, I'd even compare Brawlhalla to a drug. On the surface and on light occasions, Brawlhalla is general, good fun, especially with friends. However, if you start liking it a little too much, or if you want to get better, the trouble begins. Now, where to start?\n\nFirst of all, the game can be incredibly frustrating. Gaming rage is inevitable in pretty much every game. It might even be healthy to let off a little steam. This game, however? Brawlhalla has given me some of the worst gaming rage I've ever had.\n\nHey, difficult games are perfectly acceptable. There are countless examples of games where deaths feel fair and deserved and make you want to persevere through them to the end, making the reward even more satisfying. It's intoxicating in the best way. It makes you feel great!\n\nIn Brawlhalla, however, almost every death is completely unfair. Even now, I still play matches where I'm left shaking my head in disbelief at some of the brutality that comes rolling my way. It makes me want to play more, not because I feel good about what I'm doing but because I feel like I need to prove myself or get better to try and get past whatever stupidly unjust attack I'm hit with to no avail. It's a brutal endless cycle that keeps pulling you back for more.\n\nThis brings me to my next complaint... Spam. There is so much space left between blows for utter abuse of most of the attacks in that game. Practically no character is fair or balanced, some being even more absolutely abysmal than others. If a player can succeed simply by doing one light attack combo or a singular signature move over and over again, then what's the point of even a making attempt to achieve victory? A majority of the higher-leveled use this simply mindless tactic to gain ELO points quickly and efficiently without any consideration or respect for other players, specifically lower-leveled ones. You'll notice these groups of players using mostly Hattori, or one of the other extremely abusable legends. They'll use the basic light sword, katar, or scythe combos in quick succession repeatedly to K.O. players in seconds. Don't confuse this exploit for skill, people-this method is absolutely mindless, leaving rank in Brawlhalla practically meaningless.\n\nIn turn, you'll get used to seeing this tactic everywhere, which can make it hard to differentiae skill from spam. It becomes very confusing very fast and adds to the frustration.\n\nThe spamming problem in Brawlhalla is a major one, but it really is a simple fix. Add cooldown times to attacks after using them three times or so in a row to encourage players to experiment with more attacks and combos. This would not only fix the spam problem, it would build skill and better tactics for the next battle.\n\nFinally, I'd like to complain about the fanbase. Nowhere else on earth will you find such a cesspool of arrogance and hatred. Within my first hours of this game, I recieved quite a few bland attempts at insults from players who are trying to compensate for their lack of skill. Hell, even I'm guilty of it. It's contagious-you'll be playing a match, you'll lose to spammers, you'll get called 'ez,' rinse and repeat. The anger and toxicity spreads like wildfire and sends everything into dissaray.\n\nAs a usually pretty sensible guy, I never thought that one game would have such a negative impact on my life. I beg of you, if you want to keep your family, friends, free time, and anything else dear to you, avoid this game at all costs.\n\nAnd Blue Mammoth Games, if you're listening... please fix your game. It's blatantly broken, and many players like me are counting on you.\n\nThat will be all.", "timestamp_created": 1513305721, "timestamp_updated": 1513305721, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 516, "votes_funny": 138, "weighted_vote_score": "0.814039826393127441", "comment_count": 118, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18864173": {"recommendationid": "18864173", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178060459", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 67782, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550303936}, "language": "english", "review": "Brawlhalla? this has become more of my life than it is just a game.

This is none of that. Brawlhalla is a fighting arena, where players can have fun playing the fame, or take it to a more technical, competitive edge. Don't downgrade this game just because it's light and bouncy, and not overly technical like Smash. That's unfair to rank these two games under the same umbrella. I came from Melee background, and I find this JUST as enjoyable as I would any other game in any other format.\n\n\n\nREVIEW UPDATE:\nThere are still always ongoing changes and improvements to this game. A recent update proves that BMG openly listens to the community and takes the suggestions sent to them.\n\nA lot of people coming from the smash community were upset that there was no fast fall mechanic. That was recently changed to accomodate the faster paced players. This doesn't not have a large impact on the game, but atleast enough to provide more creative variables. No you can't just speed hop all over the place, but you wont run into issues with players always being able to read you.\n\n\n\n\nBest of luck, and welcome to Brawlhalla!", "timestamp_created": 1446587421, "timestamp_updated": 1448245499, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 68, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.786046624183654785", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15037324": {"recommendationid": "15037324", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118073798", "num_games_owned": 125, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 38796, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2, "last_played": 1551024931}, "language": "english", "review": "I've spent a decent amount of hours in this game and yet I cannot say I was ever bored playing this game.

Expect 100+ ping if you are from EU trying to play US-E god forbid US-W \n\nOverall the gameplay is ok. mechanics are mediocre. Until the new patches came in, Introducing down dodge and chain dodge. Biggest turn off when playing this game i have ever seen. Game is now a gang bang of dodging forward back down and in the same place (as per usual) people consider this game to be competitive, How can staying in the same place and repeating one move that has no dodge frames be considered Esports material? complete joke of a game when it comes to a competitive scene. MMR system isnt too bad unless you factor in smurfing that ruins the game for low level players. Diamond players stuck in gold UNTIL a wave of noobs come and create elo inflation. Getting to diamond was just as easy as getting to platinum back in season 1. No feeling of progress since you get stombed if you dare to go into ranked or even custom games. Normal winning plan for platinum/diamond players consists of:\n\n-Spam the same combo until you can knock them out easily\n-Stand still and punish their moves \n-Gimp them off the edge \n\nThis game will never achieve Esports level due to its childish attitude to gameplay and the ignorance of devs, That think adding new skins and hosting $50k prize pool tournaments is better than improving servers! Pathetic business practice, Lure the new players into a lagfest of spam and watch them leave. Those who stay are going to be the future clan leaders with eSports in the name.\n\nGame is only enjoyable if played with friends. And if you dont have those then... Say hello to the most toxic and butthurt community ever. Where even the professionals bm and people talk shit for no apparent reason but to respond to a loss. A game where everyone becomes your enemy if you use a move a bit too much or gimp them twice.\n\nWebsite has been broken for many many months 2V2 search was said to be fixed 'soon' i dont know if the devs have dimensia or they just dont care but its probably a mixture of both. Community art is ok but thats what you get then you bait 500 artists into a game with no potential (I guess they never played ranked)\n\nSpeaking of skins. Every so often they release new skins,weapons,companions and KO effects. Only way for them to make money but even the most dedicated players who dish out $100 for the 'collectors pack' have to buy the new content so they might want to change the name to 'almost complete collectors pack' (if you bought the collectors pack before the skins released)\n\nOverall game is a comparison to stepping on shit wearing flip flops and getting RSI from repeating the same moves 1000s of times. Avoid with a shitty stick people! go play smash bros instead atleast they dont charge you for every new skin that comes out. They have you buy new seasonal colors with the in-game currency. 3000 gold for one character color. thats over 100 games of slaving away doing the same crap over and over. Waste of time if i wanted to grind id go play warframe. not to mention that all the noobs cant play the new characters because on release they cost you 7200 gold. Good luck attracting new players with that attitude, When the rotation allows them to play the new hero all the tryhards mastered the spam and its not fun.

Early access is always a risky gamble but here\u2019s one where the risk is literally almost free. We\u2019re tuning into a 1v1 ranked match in Brawlhalla and we\u2019ll kick started it with that.\n\nSo far I will recommend this game. However, I do not suggest you buy any additional items at this time unless you are willing to try and be part of what could be the next big \"super smash\" on steam. ***This game has improved since it's inception*** and has added some major updates to refine and introduce new features. As the big giant blue sign says though, the game is early access.\n\nIn short, Brawlhalla is melee with the giant exception most of the battles can be fought in the air and some crazy and odd combos can be strung together. Also, here is a cool feature off the bat : the loading screen to play another online game let's you battle it out with AI's while waiting. Unlike Super Smash Bros. : Melee specifically, the game doesn't have a \"fast\" feel to the game play. Rather, the game is smoothed out and requires proper timing (and the right button) to deliver an effective blow. The game is played generally in the air but the ground attack specials provide for more than enough umph and entertainment. The challenge to out whit your opponents seems equal at almost all odds. Some players will choose to take a precautious route while others will be willing to sacrifice themselves for a win. \n\nBrawlhalla mimics in it's corridors super smash. It is because it seems as the first reference to come to mind. On the other hand, it isn't as I feel the strategies are really diverse and open to the player. There are character limitations and powers in both games but changing and throwing weapons distinguishes brawlhalla. Getting knocked off the map has become avoidable with all characters. When you think you're dead or when you have no chance, it seems playing fields are almost even all the time. The edge of the map is a different game entirely here from smash. Think of kicking a soccer ball versus a golf ball. Being able to slide on the edges opens up a new dynamic (and possibilities) for both players. It seems as those who simply wait to strike at vulnerable times seem to win the most. \n\nThe game is persistent in it's work to differentiate itself from smash. Is this a good thing or bad thing you may be asking yourself? It's neither really, until the game is done then a full judgment can be made. The scoring system seems to play the odds of K/D ratio's while the HUD display simply shows it's awesomeness in the top right (although I wish that awesomeness was a tad bit bigger in sprite size)! It's tough sometimes keeping up with the fights, but the camera does a pretty good job of keeping you right where the action is. In other words, the zoom is definitely on the right track. Multiple game types make this game phenomenal. I can jump online with friends and play a free for all or play some two player ranked. It's actually pretty nice to see considering it's in the state it's in. \n\nThere are weapon drops in the game which resembles smash, but unlike smash, you're allowed to throw away your main weapon at any time. There aren\u2019t random weapons like smash but there is some variety. The weapon-drop will drop and can be picked up within a certain time by anyone. Each character is given two weapons consistent of axes, guns, spears, swords and not limited to javelins. In this sense, some characters have preferred fighting choices and when unlocked, can change their fighting stances (which can modify stats slightly but limited to local game modes only at the moment). Items are a nice addition to the game, and do not feel as though they tilt the odds. The longer the player holds the button down, the more umph goes behind the shot. Items include a spike ball, a bomb, a mine, and my favorite, the horn. The horn creates a line of fire across the screen and even delivers another weapon to the position you blew it from. I have to admit that this style of weaponry is actually nice. It's breath of fresh air as it's something new. If you get tired of using this, try using this instead. Don't like this, go back to the other thing. \n\nGraphics resemble those of Castle Storm but there is nothing wrong with that. The art style is nice and again, sets itself apart from smash. Sounds are good, but I would like to see a variance. Make a sword sound like a sword (even when thrown), and make a javelin sound different than a sword when it bounces off the ground. Stages didn't sit well with me at first, but they do change over time. I felt as though they were a bit small, I still do but I can see why they are the size they are. I would suggest adding some levels that are larger and try to stay away from creating every level about the same size. I do like the physical changes that go on in the map, again another + for being different from smash. If you really want to get creative, maybe add certain objects that can explode, upgrade, or slow down players in certain spots (and maybe make them usable every minute or so). \n\n\n\n****SEPT 2016 update\n\nEverything is in good shape and the servers have finally improved. Game play is literally feeling in good shape and would maybe even like to see more mini-games? 4v4 local? Anything is welcomed as there is certainly no shortage on skins. I would also like to see the in-game coins be put to some kind of use in the future. Right now, everything seems dependant on Mammoth Coins. Mind you, these are only artificial changes not game re-structuring ones. I wouldn't mind seeing some more maps added in the future as well. They've been adding characters every so often but no new topography! I'm excited to see what the final-release will have in store.\n\n\n\n[h1]EARLY ACCESS RATING : 7.9/10 ***updated as Nov 2018  [/h1]\n\n\n\n[table]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Gameplay[/td]\n\t[td]B+[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Story / Campaign[/td]\n\t[td]N/A[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Visuals / User Interface[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Sounds / Music[/td]\n\t[td]B-[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Replay-ability[/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[tr]\n\t[td]Overall [/td]\n\t[td]B[/td]\n[/tr]\n[/table]\n\n\nThe devs are actually really good at hearing out the community.

Although seemingly similar to Super Smash Bros, Brawlhalla has its own unique feel where it is easy to play, but difficult to master.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n-A free-to-play game with nice payable skins, taunts etc.\n-Over 20 legends to choose from; each with their own unique abilities and play styles.\n-Ranked games provide fair and fun games for people of all skill levels (to a certain extent).\n-Has multiple game modes for casual gamers such as Brawlball, Bombsketball and Snowbrawl.\n-Developers constantly bringing updates to the game such as new legends, skins and features.\n-Simple \u201cGG\u201d button at the end of a match promotes good sportsmanship (or gamesmanship).\n-Levelling up legends unlocks more playable colours and stat configurations.\n-Ranked 2v2 matches have friendly fire set on, which encourages teamwork rather than attack spamming (although some find this to be a nuisance because of bad teammates).\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Spammers, smurfs and toxic players can ruin the game.\n-Skins, taunts, weapon skins etc can only be bought with real life money, and can be a little too pricey in some cases.\n-Can be really frustrating at times (especially when on one of those losing streaks).\n\n[b]Overall:[/b]\nBrawlhalla brings back the fun of 2D platform brawlers, especially for PC gamers.

Second, the moments that I've made with my friends are priceless. I've laughed harder at things that have happened in this game than anything. It's amazing to watch how dumb your friends can be and see how they can be tryhards at making cool plays. Third, it's free. FREE.

My advice: don't play while you're tired, it really affects your skill and you might get beat to lower rank very quickly.\nSome people say there are too few moves. I disagree: with the current number of skills you can execute sick combos and create your play style with each character. As I said, I'm in Gold tier and I cannot do some moves that seem pretty basic, yet still I win a lot. Also, some characters are easier to play, some are harder - but if you learn to play hard ones, you'll rock.\n\nPros:\n+ elastic gameplay, you can choose if you wanna play casually or hardcore\n+ large number of characters to play; each character has its style and you must learn how to play them or against them.\n+ really nice graphics - I set background from one map as a wallpaper on my corporate laptop ;D\n+ Large community, there is always somebody to play\n\nCons:\n- Balance issues - as you're mid Silver, you will hate Hattori. She is simply OP and takes a lot of defeats to learn how to fight against her. Get a few matches playing Hattori to check what are her attacks, strong and weak spots etc. Other characters have their issues too.\n- Rude community - at least in my opinion. People can be nice and thankful for a great match, but most of them are kids who get angry while losing and they either DC (one free win, so it isn't that bad ;)) or call you a spammer, noob or worse, no matter if they win or lose. It's a motherf**king game for God's sake, you're supposed to have fun with it. If you don't then why you play it? One dude wished me to die quickly - enjoy your report, mate!\n- Too few ranked modes, imho.\n- Creating a couch party game is a pain in the ass... I tried to play with my friend on one PC and we didn't manage to establish a game. I know that there is a way, but how to do it?

You can tell by my amount of hours. I have spent more money on this game than I care to share because I love it so much. It really is fun. Or at least it used to be. These days, the majority of the Brawlhalla community spends their time learning what ways are best to p i s s off other players. They include the most frustrating of tactics like spamming one combo or heavy attack to their advantage. Against these players you can tell you are more skilled, but because they've resorted to such tactics, you must adapt in whatever way possible. These matches are not fun. They're just sad; you have the skill to be evenly matched but the fight is no fun because they only do one attack. It is with great sadness that I give this game a bad review. The developers seem to support this dispicable playstyle by enhancing the movesets that are easily spammable and nerfing the skilled players' abilities to be skilled and to dodge the other players' attacks. With one particular update, you can no longer dodge into attacks. This update has completely toppled the once-fair system of evasion/combat. At one point, attacks that were simultaneous would cancel each other out. Now, there is a MASSIVE issue with the priority of attacks. One enemy who strikes simultaneously will somehow overpower your attacks, thus making spam (i.e. the same attacks over and over) the most likely attack to be prioritized. In addition to this, in both ranked gamemode types, you do not face people who are your level, you face whoever is online at any given moment. There have been moments where I (rank 1550 or so) have been pitted against rank 2100s. For those of you who do not play this game, that gap is MASSIVE. Even the difference between 1500s and 1700s is massive, to which I often fight 1700s as well as 1800s. It is very uncommon that I fight people at my own level. The same is true for the opposite however, where I have been pitted unfairly in my favor against someone in the 1200s. It is also FAR too easy to be a Platinum or higher ranked player, and drop ranks into lower tiers, where you can demolish those who are just trying to survive in the Brawl community. With all these issues combined, it has made for a poor mesh of broken mechanics. The people who comment that this game is amazing are likely to be the people who contribute to its broken-ness. I truly do love this game, it has a lot of potential, even to come. In its current state, it is little more than trash, unfortunately.

Back in the day I used to love versing my friend on Super Smash Bros Melee on their GameCube, and because of those memories, I really love this game. First of all, let's go over the positives. That may seem backwards, but it'll lead up to my major gripe with this game.\n\nPositives:\nReally responsive gameplay on keyboard: I myself play with the Mouse and Keyboard set up. I feel like I'm always hitting what I should and missing what I should, the developers have done an awesome job with this, even though I live in Australia and we need to play on SE Asian matchmaking.\n\nCool characters: I myself love playing a plethora of different characters such as Bodvar, Teros, Asuri, Orion and Lucien, and the lore that the devs put into the little world they've created really sucks me in. I love reading their lore when I'm waiting for friends to launch the game (which launches surprisingly fast), or if I'm just not playing at that moment.\n\nAwesome Lore: I know I touched on the lore when it came to the above positive, but I believed I had more to say about it. I simply love the lore, and the little tidbits they have around the character's main lore show how they relate to other characters and also what they did before arriving in Valhalla.\n\nAnd now, the:\n\nNegatives:\n\nReally, the only negative I can find is the spammability of the characters. Keep in mind, at the time of this review I have only 10 hours, so don't take my opinion like it's law, but that's my major gripe. Whenever I go up against a Hattori in my current 1v1 or even 2v2 ELOs (Both Bronze as of 16/11/2015), she seems to spam her Directional Heavy (Left/Right Rightclick/Rightbumper/K/X) every time I come close, so whenever I'm playing a character like, say, Teros, who's Heavy attacks need to be timed down to the split second, I feel at a disadvantage, and it always seems that way aswell, as whenever I believe I'm close to getting my Player Elo back to Silver, I get dropped down by a button mashing Hattori.\n\nThat's the positives and negatives I've found with this game in my 10 hours of gameplay, they've done a very good job for a F2P game.\n\nAnd the moment you've all been waiting for, the [b] TL:DR VERSION! [/b]\n\nAll in all, the game is pretty polished in a lot of the major areas, but there is also that, in my opinion, too-small gap of player skill. There's skilled players in the low to high elos and Not-So-Skilled spammers in the even higher elos. That being my major and only problem.

No, there's no shame in being one of those people, and yes, it'll probably satisfy that itch.\n\nBrawlhalla is a fighting game, although you probably know that already. The combat is fast-paced, the movesets are varied (for most of the game), and it's easy enough to pick up and play. (A friend of mine was able to beat me after only a few matches.)\n\nThe distinguishing characteristic for Brawlhalla as opposed to, say, your favorite Smash game is that everyone starts out with the same, somewhat limited moveset. The focus of the game is weapons - which vary movesets completely and completely change a character's dynamic. Each character has two weapons to keep variety. The weapons feel effectively balaned, although a few characters have somewhat powerful moves. (A good example of that is Cassidy's hammer, down-strong.) The other items are only usable with no weapon, which gives unarmed combat efficient as well.\n\nThe other aspects apart from the fights themselves are bare-bones. There's a training mode where you can use any character (as oppposed to the ones in the weekly rotation), a \"tournament\" mode, and a shop. The shop carries mostly cosmetic items, with permanent unlocks for the characters also available (which unlocks use outside of the rotation). Only the fighters and some color schemes (unlocked after playing a certain fighter a lot) are available with the regular currency - the others require Mammoth Coins, which translates into real money.

Despite the best efforts of the developers of these titles, with the inclusion of a vast, in-depth tutorial system, new players are still almost certain to get completely annihilated when they decide to take the plunge and play another person. Long chains of combos, near-perfect reads and precise timings- these almost always act as an impediment for the player to continue learning the game, which eventually results in them giving up in the genre. And yet, though Brawlhalla has these three aformentioned traits present in its gameplay, I consider it a far more suitable entry point to the genre than these two (and many other similar) titles.\n\nThe main reason for this is because of the different formula Brawlhalla uses in comparison with most other titles in the genre. While a fighting game is generally difficult to learn and difficult to master, [i]Brawlhalla is easy to learn and difficult to master[/i]. This key difference is what makes players that are curious about the game stay and practice to get better. The wonderful 2d art style, the fluid animations and the catchy soundtrack do well to complement the game and command the players' interest for longer.\n\nUnfortunately, Brawlhalla's design philosophy of simplifying can be off-putting to some, particularly the seasoned veterans of the genre. This is because of the simplified combat in Brawlhalla compared to other games in its niche like Super Smash Bros and Rivals of Aether. The combat in Brawlhalla revolves around the use of weapons, with each hero alotted a unique set of two different types of weapons. The attacks of two of the same weapons (two spears on two different heroes for instance) are effectively identical, with the exception of a unique signature move which varies per hero, and a slight variation in stats. As a result, there isn't much diversity between each different hero- the playstyle of one hero can apply to almost every other hero. However, the advantage of this is that the heroes are far more balanced than many other fighting games as a result. This means that any hero you pick is viable in both casual and competitive play. The only thing stopping you from beating other players is your skill level.\n\nIn this regard, Brawlhalla itself doesn't offer much in terms of teaching the player how to get better at the game. Its tutorials only teach basic movement and the general moveset. However, due the the vast and active community, learning combos or more advanced techniques is as simple as a quick search in the Steam community or Youtube. The training mode provided has plenty of features which are more than enough for a player to perfect their weapon and/or hero of choice.\n\nBrawlhalla isn't the only game in the genre that follows its formula, there are a few others. However, it has the added benefit over its competitors of being completely free to play. None of the various modes or features are locked behind a paywall, and the only use of money in the game is to purchase cosmetics such as skins and taunts. Therefore there is virtually no impediment for anyone to at least try the game out and see if it suits their tastes.

Don't start to say \"dash sucks, dash is bad\", at least put some thought into it. TL;DR at the end.\n\n\n[h1]Dodges[/h1]\nWith season 6, ground dodges (directional dodges and chain dodges) were replaced with a dash. It's around the lines of Dash in the so popular Smash games. With dodge in Bh you can evade every attack, because it gave you invulnerabilty frames. Speeddodging could be used only when you had the right momentum and it gave you a small speed boost for it duration. It could be chained up to two chaindodges in ANY direction. This mechanic led to huge neutral games that were based on chaindodging around and punishing the aggressor. The defensive playstyle was favorable at almost every skill level. Diamond/tournament meta was the most boring thing ever, because nobody wanted to engage first.\n\n[h1]Dash[/h1]\nNow that I've covered some of the dodge stuff, let's talk about dash. Dash it's a fast movement option that has no cooldown timer (unlike dodges) and no iframes. You can still spotdodge, air dodge, chasedodge. After a dash you start to sprint in that direction, giving you increased speed. You can chain multiple dashes. You can also do a backdash, that can't be chained in another bdash. Dashdance it's when you bdash>dash>bdash>dash>repeat for how long do you want. It's a great way to play the \"footsies\". Jump dash it's also a thing. Watch this video[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GVdLPP30V8&t=56s]  for other basic dash mechanics.\n\nDash added a lot of new techs into the game that raised the skillfloor and skillroof by a lot. It has been available for testing in the Experimental mode for ONE MONTH. There was a plenty of time for the playerbase to try it and get used to it. It's not a change that has been implemented out of nowhere. Everyone that has played the game had to unlearn the old habbits and lean new ones. It opens a new way for skilled players to engage, it helps breakomg the neutral game and keeping up the pressure. In the end BH it's a fighting game, not 9D chess that evolves about punishing the aggressor. That's bs.\n\nIf you want to be teached about dash, abut how to use it, add me on steam or on Discord Piox#1752 I'm on the EU server, btw.\nOther resources for getting help: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlhalla/ \nBrawl League Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/brawlleague (getting a mentor or asking questions about the game in general) \nInformative video about dash made my Ephi, one of the pros players: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izwE3lJEs0I\nCounter argument of Jellyfish, another pro player, that thinks that dash'll probably won't be a good change to BH: https://www.reddit.com/r/Brawlhalla/comments/700oew/if_you_dont_like_dash_please_read_this_before_you/dmzlitk/\nYou can also watch top players on Twitch to see how they use dash in their games. I'm 100% sure you'll learn something from that. \n[h1]TL;DR:[/h1] Dash replaced grounded dodges/speeddodges; it makes the game a lot fast-paced, the aggressor having an easier time to engage and keep the pressure; it offeres a higher skillfloor/skillroof; it takes a couple of hours to get used to after playing with cdodges previously, but trust me that it's a lot better after you learn how to use it effectively.", "timestamp_created": 1480018835, "timestamp_updated": 1505485193, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 12, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.534903049468994141", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "42689353": {"recommendationid": "42689353", "author": {"steamid": "76561198242827708", "num_games_owned": 20, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12375, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548554622}, "language": "english", "review": "Please fix the matchmaking of this game.

However, it has taken out a lot of the things that made Smash so difficult to learn in recent years and what is left is an elegant game that is easy to understand but hard to master.\n\n[b]Good Movement[/b]: The first thing to notice is how accurate and precise the movement is. The movement in other games of this style is often very floaty, making it hard to position your character correctly. In Brawlhalla the movement is 1:1 and easy to predict.\n\n[b]Simple Controls[/b]: The controls are mercifully simple: weak attack, heavy attack, jump, throw item, and dodge (and taunt). The key difference between Brawlhalla and other games of this type is the weapon system. When unarmed every character has the same moves, but when you pick up a weapon powerup you will get one of two weapons (randomly). These weapons are set per character, and the light attacks are the same for every character.\n\nThere are combos, but they are limited to strings of three attacks at the absolute most. This places more of an emphasis on positioning and correct skill usage - though to be fair, there are a few difficult combos that are essential to very high level play.\n\n[b]Interesting Weapon System[/b]: The differences between characters come down to three \"signature\" moves per weapon, and different stat configurations (armor, speed, etc.). While this probably sounds like a negative, what this means is that it is very easy to reach a point where you can play almost any character, because all you need to do is master the basic attacks of each weapon and then test out a character's six signature moves. Even better, the signature moves often function in similar ways: no direction + signature is usually an anti air, for example.\n\n[b]Elegant Item System[/b]: Apart from the weapons, there are exactly four items. The bomb detonates on contact, the landmine sticks to a surface and will blow up when a player approaches, and the spike ball is a projectile that is reusable and does a high amount of knockback. There is also a horn, which can be blown to summon a fireball and carry in a weapon for you, or it can be thrown as a projectile.\n\nAll four of these items can be caught out of mid air if your timing is good, and most of them can be used to set up elaborate traps or combos; bounce the bomb against the ground and then kick your opponent into it as it arcs downward.\n\n[b]Great Training Mode[/b]: If you do want to grind out hours in training mode, this game offers you lots of data. You can see the hitboxes of any move, and even slow down and replay each frame of a move to see where the hitboxes and hurtboxes are at any given point. There is the standard combo and damage counter as well.\n\n[b]Recommended to Those With Smash Fatigue[/b]: All of this is to say that this is a simplified game in all of the best ways. Sticking to a small set of items and reducing the control barrier makes Brawlhalla a joy to play and improve at. The complexity comes from learning how its design elements interact, more so than grinding out hours in training mode.\n\nThis recommendation is really for people who are not a fan of the increasing complexity of Smash Bros. Fans of that series may be reading this and thinking that all of my positives sound like negatives. If that sounds like you, try it out anyway, it's free.\n\nLastly, I want to say that the way the developers interact with the community is great. Their patch notes are delivered with good explanations for why they made each change, and they take both game feel and win ratio into account when balancing characters. They update weekly, or nearly weekly, the servers are usually good, and new characters come out regularly.", "timestamp_created": 1457206017, "timestamp_updated": 1459806592, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 36, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.720847427845001221", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "13014323": {"recommendationid": "13014323", "author": {"steamid": "76561198097707084", "num_games_owned": 4609, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 721, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1451181773}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome game , much fun and i love it <3\n\nnice characters and skills and colors , music..so fun matches\n\n\ni see a future for this game , i believe its worth a try so try it !", "timestamp_created": 1416477284, "timestamp_updated": 1416477284, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.634791731834411621", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29185767": {"recommendationid": "29185767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198132784250", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 69491, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549954824}, "language": "english", "review": "Salthalla", "timestamp_created": 1484151460, "timestamp_updated": 1484151460, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 143, "votes_funny": 134, "weighted_vote_score": "0.69927448034286499", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "17733985": {"recommendationid": "17733985", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016011200", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 19393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542596972}, "language": "english", "review": "[i] Brawlhalla is almost everything I'm looking for in a PC Smash Bros-style game.
