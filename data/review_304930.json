There are maps for all types of computers, small maps such as Hawaii and large maps such as Russia which is four times the size of them small maps. Graphics on the game can expand on a scale of low to ultra so it can be played on most computers and some laptops.\n\n-So how well is the gameplay?-\nInterface: Very simplistic, easy to learn, and gives a great outlook on the game. The game has a very helpful tutorial world which tells you all the basics including interface information which makes it even easier to learn. Your screen will turn grey when you are low on health as well.\n\nSingleplayer: Better with friends but if you are looking for a solo game then this is a great game for that. Building bases and gathering a sum of vehicles make the game interesting for a very long time so it attracts you for quiet a while.\n\nPay to win: Not at all... you can buy the \"Permanent Gold Upgrade\" if you want more accessories and \"Gold\" servers which allow you to have less hackers in the game. Battle-eye usually catches hackers so it is no problem at all.\n\nOnline interaction: There are servers for RP, surviving, and killing other players... so if you want to get on a RP server to find some people to hang out with then you can. Once you have a group of friends you can head over to a PvP server and group together. All together the game seems pretty good for online interaction, probably one of the best.\n\nCrafting: Pretty simple and easy to get along with, it is nice to use for all types of servers.\n\nVehicles: Can be a little bumpy but in all the vehicles are great for traveling and running over people or zombies. If you want to upgrade your car then you can add barbed-wire, metal or wood, and even workshop parts to it! The customizing is to an extent of almost anything you can think of for a vehicle.\n\nContent in total: This game is great for videos for your own server or any server in total. If you are on a single-player world or your own server you can use different camera angles (Shift + F1-F8). These different camera angles make it pretty great for the production of videos. If you wanted to green screen something then you can get a green screen room in the workshop and make some great scenes. There are a lot of things you can do to furnish in your game... there are also workshop mods to add more! You can also buy skins, get skin crates, or even earn skins by playing a long time. Over all the game has maximum customizing just because of this.", "timestamp_created": 1550989412, "timestamp_updated": 1550989412, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.607936322689056396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49113197": {"recommendationid": "49113197", "author": {"steamid": "76561198086398548", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550388201}, "language": "english", "review": "its nice isn't it?", "timestamp_created": 1550638210, "timestamp_updated": 1550638210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.547988474369049072", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49322818": {"recommendationid": "49322818", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354074853", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 38201, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1521, "last_played": 1551566458}, "language": "english", "review": "This is a great game you can get for free, although there are a few flaws. I used to be a pvp god spending most of my time on a server called plastic warfare before it became a modded mess. The gameplay is fun and addictive.

The pvp is fun and rewarding, but there is one fatal flaw... this allowed the game to grow, but attract the wrong fanbase... the game is free. Now, im not saying it shouldn't be free, the only reason it is successful is probably because it is free. But, free games attract children. And children want no challenge. There is a extreme lack of good servers. The only servers you'll find are 10x servers and rp servers with op kits that you won't get to use. Hopefully 4.0 might fix this issue. Oh, i almost forgot... the workshop mods! You'll find a lot of workshop mods and maps, and hopefully there's one of them you'll like. Can't find any maps? Make your own.

Still, the game is appealing graphically and audibly, and it makes for a good time if you can get some friends. One thing I can say is, the multiplayer is the side of Unturned I don't really go on. PVP is nice every once in awhile, but it's different when that's what over 50% of the servers are. But this isn't completely the developer(s)'s fault, or a bad thing. The community wants what it wants. Yet, we've been losing some of our more dedicated players, and that's why I really want there to be more survival-related updates instead of just combat based tweaks.

This is a genre that has been over-done, but Unturned manages to be unique in it's own way. Kill zombies, gather resources, hunt animals, craft things and scavenge for items. That's all you do. \n\nYou only have 3 types of enemies in Unturned, there's the normal, the military and the Mega zombies, the latter being quite rare and way more powerful which will make you want to run if you encounter one, especially if you're playing on Hard, but Unturned is more about the quantity of enemies... if you get swarmed, you're gonna have a bad time!\n\nThe beauty in Unturned stands in how simple it is, yet manages to be fun and quite graphically stunning. The developer team is just one single developer, and he's about 17 years old, that is something that should always be remembered, because not only does he update the game on a regular basis (about twice a week now), he has improved this game from an almost unplayable mess for older computers which was v2.0, to a polished and really smooth game v3.0 is. \n\nI still haven't bought the Gold Upgrade, but I'm planning on doing it, just because I want to \"donate\" to Nelson Saxton, this is how Free to Play should be. There's no \"BUY HP FOR 5$\", the game is COMPLETELY free, and all you get from the golden upgrade is cosmetic stuff, like new facial expressions, skin coloring and access to the Gold servers, which are restricted to \"Premium\" members (great for when you want to avoid F2P newbies). Again, there is more content but it's not shoved in your face 24/7, and it doesn't really make you a superior, more well-equipped player for owning it.\n\nThere's a set of skills where you use the experience you gather from killing zombies, hunting animals and harvesting resources, these skills are all very helpful to your survival, and will take their time to be fully upgraded. For now there's the Offense, Defense, and Support skills, maybe we'll see more in the future :)\n\nThere are numerous items in this game and for the looks of it, new items are still being added in each update. Weapons go from Hockey Sticks and Golf clubs, to Sniper Rifles, Machine Guns and more. You can find some vehicles too with a Fuel system, which means you can't go everywhere with your car without scavenging for fuel first. There's also tons of food around, but good luck on finding it in good condition, because Unturned also uses an item quality system. You can eat a carrot, but if it's moldy, your illness  percentage will increase and you'll end up scavenging for pills in order to cure it.\n\nDo you remember how satisfying it felt in Resident Evil 4, when you had your inventory all organized and in place? Unturned now has the same type of inventory in v3.0, which is way more realistic than the inventory in v2.0. An item takes X number of squares depending on it's size. Oh, and you can choose 2 of these items for quick switching with the 1 and 2 keys, you'll probably put your weapon/tool here, since a zombie always appears out of the blue!\n\nThere's not much more to say about Unturned, it's a great game where you and your friends can spend lots of hours just creating a house and equipping it, or just scavenging and exploring Prince Edward Island to find all the secrets that lies within it. Unturned is a must play to anyone who has a Steam account, even if it is for just 1 hour, it will be enough to see the effort of a young developer which I undoubtedly respect. I'm not saying it's the best game ever, I even admit it can be a bit boring after some time (for me), but for the price of 0$, it's an awesome game, and I'm pretty sure I'll play it in the future to check out the updates. \n\nScore: 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1430455583, "timestamp_updated": 1430455739, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 219, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.919302999973297119", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "46080602": {"recommendationid": "46080602", "author": {"steamid": "76561198329697051", "num_games_owned": 259, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 15111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548388794}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n   [*] Free to play\n   [*] Base building \n   [*] Crafting \n   [*] Mild Farming \n   [*] Large Maps \n   [*] Workshop \n   [*] Active dev \n   [*] Multiplayer and Singleplayer \n   [*] Vehicles you can drive, steal, and damage \n   [*] Has a couple of wild, dangerous animals (bear/wolf)\n[/list]\n\n[b]Neutral:[/b]\n[list]\n   [*] Zombies (I like zombies but others may not)\n   [*] Blocky style (it's not bad, but sometimes it does look a bit silly)\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n   [*] Other players (it's not always bad, but some people take the raiding too far)\n   [*] Possible cheating and/or people who abuse their power as the mod on a server \n   [*] Kits and the like that turns the game into a spamfest \n   [*] It's been a while for me, but I believe the Permanent Gold Upgrade also poses a mild issue.

(imo)\n\n- Gameplay, the biggest change in gameplay is the balance and additions to the skill system which are good. Still lacking as I think there's great potential for perks for skills.\n\n- Gunplay, the gunplay in this game is a lot better since the recoil feels really good and the amount of modifications for the guns is a really good size.\n\n- Multiplayer, wow has the multiplayer in this game gotten good, no longer do you have to search up tutorials on how to join servers and try to find servers that still even run. You just open up a server list and you can search for the most players, best ping, easy or normal games, or just join any server you see, your choice.\n\nThere are multiple difficulties including easy normal hard and premium, although most are normal with stupid plugins and rules such as starterkits and no KOS.\n\n- Graphics, nelson changed the game to a newer version so that came along with better lighting, reflections and better particles.\n\n- Vehicles, holy shit they are way better, funny how an 18 year old dev can create better driving than overkill software (creators of payday 2).\n\n- Performance, it performs statistically a lot better since he updated the game to a newer version of the engine he uses.

But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a \"Blam\" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose.

The fact that this game has been developed by a 16 year old astonishes me. The aesthetics suit the game. Yes, the graphics are not great. However, I think, it should stay like this. It gives the game an identity. When I first played the game, I was not expecting much. I wasn't expecting a full on tactical rpg, or a racing game, or a base build survival co op, or a PVP open world deathmatch. I wasn't expecting any of these. Yet, it offered all of this. Survival is very rewarding. However, be warned, your stuff can vanish depending on the server. Dont get too attached to your items. Sandbox servers are the best as they allow you to do anything you want.\n\nUnturned is a blast, you can really do anything. However, the community can be very toxic sometimes. Depending on how you look at it. In conclusion: The game does no other triple A game has done. H1Z1 and DayZ don't feel that friendly. Unturned feels friendly to new comers.

This game is a free-to-play steam game, so obviously anyone can really play this. That being said, unturned is a zombie survival game which requires you to gather weapons, food, water, and other resources to stay alive. So far there are 3 (official) maps implimented into the game. It's possible to download more along with other weapons and items from the community workshop. You can play this game by yourself, with friends, or just join a multiplayer server. The game offers PVP and PVE game types. The game offers 3 difficulty types: easy, normal, and hard. If you do play this game and decide you like it, you can always purchase the \"Permanent Gold Upgrade\" for $4.99 which gives you a few gold items for your character.

They're basically a 10 year old version of DayZ or H1Z1 players.\n-The hit range can sometimes be a bother.

Most servers follow a pay to win format and are focused on PvP (get lucky to find a gun and kill everyone you meet) or die trying. These servers are trash. However if you join a server without plugins such as TPA and kits, it is completely different. It feels like a survival game more than a FPS. You get to build a base... only to get offline raided, fight off zombies while exploring towns, military bases, and other places. You get a chance to be the best rather than paying for a free gun kit and plane.\n\nBut why do I recommend this game? Simple. Besides the current state, it has been improving greatly since what it used to be a long time ago. The community has improved to an extent, the recent addition of bullet drop and scope sway makes sniping require more skill rather than a simple point, click the head and get an instant kill, and the workshops includes mods to suit almost anyone.\n\nThe workshop- it's brilliant. Nelson has done a good job with the additions he has made to Unturned, but the workshop has a lot of good content, including a lot of gun and hat skins (which has caused the economy to be similar to CS:GO or TF2) there are maps that can go up to 64 square kms and dwesigned for a lot of gamemodes. There's maps designed for survival similar to Washington/PEI and works well due to it's design, Maps that allow you to race, Maps such as mine (Isle of Wolves) which is based on progression, and of course arenas and maps to try and replicate famous maps such as Chernarus and Dust II. And some modders have added many workshop guns and vehicles too. Want to fire away at a horde of zombies with a minigun while your friend is flying you around on a Hummingbird? Now you can.\n\nThe graphics is rather a blocky and simple design. I don't dislike the design, but some people would be put off by it. Nelson has said he will improve it to have graphics that are similar to Firewatch. which I suppose is better, we'll have to find out ourselves. However this simple design makes it seem more like a cartoon than realism, which people could see it relate to games like Minecraft, just with guns.\n\nIf you are one who doesn't want to play the game due to factors such as the community, go ahead.

Irradiation is the hardest to take care of once you progress.

You can heal from eating, using medkits, and a few other actions. Hunger and thirst are the easiest to take care of. You can find canteens, and fill them with ocean water to avoid having to find bottled water or soda. You can also grow crops, and cultivate a farm at a location of your choice.  A few tips I can give are:\n\nSet up a base away from zombies or towns, they can attack and destroy crops, and bases.\n\nBe sure to NEVER provoke zombies once you first start with no weapon, unless you are an older player.\n\nAlso, make sure that the first thing you do is raid a farmhouse, you can find arrows, bows, guns, axes, bats, chainsaws, etc.\n\nYou will sometimes find what I like to call the \"Hulk\" \nIt is a zombie that is larger than normal, and does alot of damage. If you try to fight him, be sure to kite him, or just shoot him.\n\nIf you don't know what kiting is, it is when you allow the enemy to attack, and when he is done attacking, stab him, then quickly run back before he hits you.

Also, thought I'd mention this game is made by a 17-year-old guy. No-one else.

The community provides a huge ammount of modifications, such as maps, weapon skins and vehicles.\n\nSo lets get into the point!\n\nThe game has been arround for a long time (since 2014), so it has improved significantly since the first version. \n\n[b] Info [/b]\nThe current version includes huge ammounts of content such as cars, planes, berries, different weapons (everything from snipers to makeshit weapons to railguns) and armor.\nBase building is one of the key aspects of the game. Its fully customizable and allows you to build nearly anything. With the bases comes also base raiding and equiptments from side to side introduced in various updates that are still on going.\nC4, Rocket Launcher, Tank shell, You name it!\n\nThere are also several different enemy types. The most common is of course the normal zombie. they don't really have any special abilities, but there are few variations like crawlers and runners. The second most common are the acid throwers and flame zombies which actually explode and spread fire. The game also has giants who actually throw rocks at you!\n\n[b] Mods \n[/b]\nThe game has a really high moding potential. Several new community made weapon skins are added every month for almost every weapon! As said before the community has advanced on even higher level and provides a lot of high quality maps and vehicle modifications. I would recommend maps such as OverGrown and Quarantine.\n\n[b] Online [/b]\nUnturned offers many different game modes from Paintball to Survival games (Arena). Most of the people usually prefer the classical survival which is often mixed with some roleplay aspects on many servers. Starting a server is very simple and shouldn't require much knowledge, so anyone with almost any pc is able do it. \nI haven't really experienced much problems with servers (IE: Connection, Hosting).\n\n[b] Performance [/b]\n\nPowered by Unity Engine, should run on almost any pc +30 fps. \nThe performance isn't really high, only 70 fps on GTX 860m medium settings.\nAnd about graphics. You can't really expect much from a game which has simpler graphics than minecraft so I don't really have anything to tell about them.\n\n[b] Overall [/b]\n\nGreat survival game with a moding potential of garry's mod.\nFriendly towards new players, Offers some great FPS/Sandbox/Survival gameplay.\n9/10\n", "timestamp_created": 1478374130, "timestamp_updated": 1478374130, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 104, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848583877086639404", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12604509": {"recommendationid": "12604509", "author": {"steamid": "76561198148204298", "num_games_owned": 71, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 82354, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1538075452}, "language": "english", "review": "Unturned:\nYup, it's another zombie-survival game, but just because it's traits aren't different, doesn't mean it's a bad game. The graphics are strange, but they're better than many other free games and even some paid ones. Solo is fun, but it does get boring pretty fast sadly. In multiplayer you have 2 choices---> 1: Join a random PvP server or PvE server and meet-up with 99% jerks---> 2: Join a friend's server or create your own, where you can play with or against your friends.\nI personally have done both. What I have found (some is based on opinion) are that random servers tend to be more laggy, especially on my computer. The random ones also tend to have NO SUPPLIES EVER!!! I'm NOT saying it wasn't fun. It was fun! The good parts about the random server are the extra challenge, which yes is VERY difficult to overcome these overpowered opponents, but possible. You can also play the hiding game, where you stealth around and try to kill your overpowered opponents with strategy such as: Using a horde of zombies on them, Making them bleed with a trap, or sneaking up on them and shooting them in the face 50 times with the worst gun in the game. OPTION 2: Playing with friends! I personally found this to be A LOT more fun! There are various mini-games you can play as well. PvE is also a good time! Although I did get bored fairly quickly, it was fun watching my team-mate derp around in a horde of zombies.\nSuggestions:\n- Create-Your-Own worlds, cars, etc.\n- Make the bridge lead to a city area, with MANY more zombies, but better loot.\n- Make the arena better in some way\n- Make alternate game-modes.\n- Add bikes, moter-cycles, and ATV's that go VERY FAST, but you fall off if you hit a zombie and it breaks down faster (A LOT of damage when hitting a zombie).\nOverall:\nThis game made me want to cry when I first played it. I wish I could feel the same feeling of when I first played it! I hope the creator adds some new spicy stuff, including the create-your-own stuff that he is already doing (I think). The game is difficult at first, but you as a player can adapt.

The dev works on this everyday and is always looking for feedback and opinions on how the game is shaped, also constantly putting out strawpolls to the community and listens to us.\n\nUnturned is played how you want, example, if you only want PVE you can select your server and if you want a PVP experience with your PVE you can select PVP enabled on your server, and yes, you can host your own servers on your computer.\n\nIt starts out like many other apocalypse survival games: you start out with your fists and 4 slots for your inventory. You have a lot of places you can wander to when you spawn, like a cabin camp, small town, military base, and many more. Your main mission when you start is to grab a melee, some food with drink, and a backpack. Once you've acquired these necessities, you may wish to find a gun if you want to PVP, or you may want to collect seeds to start a farm, or even start chopping down trees to make yourself a cozy place to spend the night.\n\nThe PVP system is great also, server hosts can select if players can bring in loot from their server (best for PVP) or not be able to bring loot in (Best for PVE Immersion). Their is a leaning system so you can peek corners also. You can also SHOOT OUT OF CARS (but not from the drivers seat of course)! Load some of your buddies in the trunk of your truck and do a hillbilly drive-by if you wish!\n\nThe towns are well structured for PVP also, their are lot of CQC battles to be fought, and also small hills for sniping, but snipers can be easily flanked if you don't post up right!\n\nBase raiding is also important in PVP too. People on public servers will build structured bases equipped with sniper pits, plenty of windows, and escape routes! You must observe a player's base and attack it strategically, you never know how many players may be in there!\n\nNow, time to farm my crops and build my base, I recommend you do so also!\n\nSteam group link for clan: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/TheMicBrothers", "timestamp_created": 1402972246, "timestamp_updated": 1495348392, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3238, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912822723388671875", "comment_count": 156, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "29149808": {"recommendationid": "29149808", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062641181", "num_games_owned": 982, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 11552, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486830823}, "language": "english", "review": "Unturned is a PvE/PvP zombie survival game.\n\n[h1]Summary[/h1]\nLike any zombie survival game is the goal in Unturned to build a big base and show dominance.\nYou loot villages, military bases, camping sites, farms, and more to find loot that will help you get stronger.

You have yourself an Outfield? Put a Silencer, Bipod, and a x12 Scope on it and you have an effective silenced sniper. Don't have a x12 Scope, Silencer, or Bipod? Take 2 duct tape and craft it with binoculars. Then take 2 empty cans and 2 cans of Cola and craft them with fire from a Campfire. Finally, find a Tactical Laser. All these will make a Zoomomatic (Scope that is better than the x6, but no reticle), a Muffler (Silent shooting, but muzzle flash still active), and the Tactical laser acts as a reticle for the Zoomomatic. It's the small things like this that I love in survival games. Being able to create a makeshift sniper using little Millitary grade equipment is just one example of the combinations of weapons and attachments.[/spoiler] \n\n(Survival Segment)\n\n[spoiler]The surviving aspect is also amazing.

Make sure to Keep them down by eating food and drinking any drink. Illness can be gained from multiple sources, such as getting hit by zombies and eating raw/rotten foods and drinks. Illness can only be brought down with Vitamins, Anti-biotics, and a type of berry and it's crushed counterpart. You can go from town to town scavenging food and drinks, or you can take to the hills in search of wildlife to hunt. Grab a fire axe, handsaw, and pickaxe to start building a base in the hills, or fortify the roof of a building. Build traps for zombies and players alike. Light up an area with generators and worklights.[/spoiler]\n\n(Experience Segment)\n\n[spoiler] As you hunt animals, kill zombies, collect wood, and mine rocks, you will tend to notice a notification at the top of your screen informing you that you have gained som experience. At the start of Unturned, you are very vulnurable, But fear not. Pressing the button you have bound to open up inventory (Default is Tab) will reveal....your inventory. At the bottom you will see three tabs labeled Apperal, Crafting, and Skills. Selecting Skills will replace your character at the right with many options. The top shows your current experience and the red bars show the ammount of levels it can be upgraded by (Red being levels not yet achieved and Green being current level). For starters, you should focus on upgrading Survival (Slower thirst and hunger gained) and Immunity (Heal more effectivly and less Illness gained from zombie hits and raw/rotten foods). After that, you can decide if you want to upgrade Stamina to outrun the zombies or Warrior to fight back. Build more structures and traps with Crafting. Sneak around zombies and towards wildlife with Sneakybeaky. Take the shot with little recoil thanks to Marksman. Chop and mine faster with Outdoors. These Skills make surviving easier, just make sure to keep an eye on the Hunger and Thirst bar.[/spoiler]\n\nIn summary, this game as a fantastic weapon system, challenging survival, and rewarding skills. 10/10 for both the game and this being my longest review ever.", "timestamp_created": 1404332676, "timestamp_updated": 1407556271, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2034, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.903506278991699219", "comment_count": 67, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "11828531": {"recommendationid": "11828531", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078909717", "num_games_owned": 44, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 132, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437360174}, "language": "english", "review": "if your computer cant run dayz yet......this is for you", "timestamp_created": 1408771508, "timestamp_updated": 1408771508, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 64, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.78143763542175293", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "41488169": {"recommendationid": "41488169", "author": {"steamid": "76561198437268648", "num_games_owned": 1, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10533, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550410959}, "language": "english", "review": "Unturned, is got to be one of the most addicting F2P games out there, Because of how fun it can get playing within friends,\nbut there can be some bugs in the game at times.

The graphics are pretty basic, smooth flat coloured surfaces and blocky character models... but I like them a lot. I think the graphics, more than simple, are just plain charming. I love the silly character customization too. And who doesn't want to be able to survive in the apocalypse with their friends? Multiplayer for games like these is necessary, and I'm glad Unturned supports multiplayer gameplay.\n\nI've heard a lot of people complaining that the beginning is too hard, but honestly as soon as I found a melee weapon I felt pretty set. If anything, I think the gameplay is too easy as it is right now. (This is before the big 3.0 update that is currently in developement) Once I established a base to store things in my character just stopped dying haha. Crafting is confusing and unintuitive though and I felt like it really took too many resources. (But maybe that's just me) the update is fixing that though with a built in crafting menu that gives you recipes based on the resources you have in your inventory. (As far as I can tell)\nOnce the newest version is released it will have a custom map maker as well! It's fairly easy to use once you've tinkered with it a little bit. I've already seen some amazing content from the community!\n\nAnyway, If you're looking for something different from minecraft and dayz, look elsewhere.\nBut if you want a fun and simple survival game with lots of respawning zombies to headshot and constant content and gameplay updates, try it out. Why not? It's free! It also has some great PvP potential! (Hiding in fields, wearing camoflauge to sneak up on people, using things like trees, bushes, buildings to stealth with, etc)\nAlso, the game is being overhauled and so far the beta of the newest version really is adding a lot of improvements! I can't wait to see where this game goes!\n\nBefore I finish I'm going to say that the developer (Nelson Sexton) really puts a lot of hard work into this game. He listens to the community well and updates more than the other early access games I'm keeping my eyes on. I really apreciate how much time and effort he manages to put into Unturned.\n\nI recommend buying gold if you like this game! The bonuses are worth the $5.

It doesn't appear to have amazing graphics, it has a Roblox-looking vibe, and there are noobs everywhere. Well, some of this IS true, but this is one of those games that you have to submerge yourself in a little before the true beauty shows. It can be seen as a game where you wander around chugging glue and getting high in order to stay alive a little longer...or it can be seen as a challenging survival experience where strategy is key. With full release said to be coming soon, let's see what early access is like in Unturned.\n\nUnturned is a zombie apocalypse game where you must wander around as a human survivor to collect food, water, keep warm, and avoid zombies to stay alive as long as possible. You can find a plane if you want and go on a joy ride, then maybe you can start building a giant base, storing your prized finds from your adventures. After a few weeks of playing singleplayer, you've done everything. So why not check out multiplayer? There's plenty more to see and experience in this game.\n\nLet's talk about the look, since that's one of the main things we focus on.  The graphics have no crazy detail whatsoever, but that's not the point. The graphics are focused: You see what you need to see. You'll soon find that the models actually look quite pleasing in their basic and rounded look.\n\nAlright what about the survival experience? It can be very challenging in its own unique way.  You need to keep finding fresh food and water to stay alive, and you'll have to strategize and plan where you will go to satisfy your stomach. There is a temperature mechanic, where you will have to take cover in shelter during the cold and dress up to stay warm. It can be difficult to create a sustainable food source outside of towns. In short, the survival aspects in this game always keep you moving around the map like a nomad. You can settle down in one place...but not long before you have to make another run to Big J's Diner for some grub.\n\nLet's talk PvP...a big aspect to this game. If you thought shooting zombies with a high caliber DragonFang is fun, try shooting at some other players in multiplayer. The gun mechanics are satisfying: You have your standard recoil, your aiming, but where this system really shines is the customization. This ranges from increasing accuracy with a barrel attachment, or alleviating recoil with a nice grip. The melee is pretty great too. With left-click, you get the standard attack for that given weapon. With right-click, and the sacrifice of a little enegery and a longer attack time, you can strike a heavy, hammering attack on both zombies, and players. The aspects put together are very easy to understand, and creates several opportunities for players to have their own technique.\n\nHere are my PROS and CONS.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Great in it's simplicity | It's a very simple looking game, and that makes it special.\n-Amazing PvP mechanics | The PvP in this game is very nice and customizable. Well balanced.\n-No pay-to-win! | You can buy a Gold upgrade, and gun skins, but never any advantage-granting things.\n-Player and UI (User Interface) customizability | Tune your looks to fit your style.\n-Ties in with Steam groups | Make a Steam group for your Unturned team, it ties into multiplayer.\n-Absolutely free (as of now) | Unturned is 100% free to play (this may change at full release...)!\n-Easy to use map maker | The game features a great way for players to make their own maps.\n-Steam Workshop capabilities | Design mods, skins, and more with the Steam Workshop.\n\nI thought, since this review unexpectedly gained popularity, that I would take advantage of this situation to direct Nelson's attention to some things the community, and I, would like to see before full release. These have been gathered from both me, and comments I've seen from the comminity (Feel free to suggest more things in a reply to this review, I will add them if they seem fit for the game.)\n\n-The return of the original Canada map, restored and re-balanced of course. :)\n-Add an electrical system to the game. This could include ways to generate electricity, store it (to a certain extent), power other electric-requiring things (this could include car batteries).\n\n\nThank you so much for your efforts and time, Nelson!", "timestamp_created": 1458749764, "timestamp_updated": 1477168757, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 129, "votes_funny": 21, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855493307113647461", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "27202608": {"recommendationid": "27202608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058995783", "num_games_owned": 236, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 11393, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513221351}, "language": "english", "review": "When I first got this game I was not a fan. \n[list]\n    [*]The crafting required a wiki to figure out\n    [*]The inventory was weight limited\n    [*]Almost no zombie variety\n[/list]\n\nToday this game has improved MASSIVELY\n[list]\n    [*]Added a crafting menu to browse blueprints (which are simplified and intuitive)\n    [*]The inventory is space limited (bringing the joys of the inventory shuffle)\n    [*]More variety in zombies, guns, and vehicles\n[/list]\n\nThis game has gone from one of my least favorite to a staple in my library.", "timestamp_created": 1480000765, "timestamp_updated": 1480000765, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 121, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.841507375240325928", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "15987267": {"recommendationid": "15987267", "author": {"steamid": "76561198109617497", "num_games_owned": 184, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 42176, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550382965}, "language": "english", "review": "[b]TL;DR[/b]\n\nThis game is a great sandbox survival game where you can construct houses, kill zombies, scavenge for supplies, store the stuff you find and in multiplayer modes, fight against or with other players for supplies and survival. The graphics are not the fanciest that can be found out there, but it's because of the pure and unique style this game has. A moderately complicated crafting system is also present. If you like survival MMOs, this game is for you. There's also a singleplayer mode for a more peaceful experience.\n\n[b]1. The Actual Review[/b]\n\nWhen I downloaded this game, I wasn't really expecting much, especially because my brother recommended it and most of games he likes, I don't. But it was a huge blast when I noticed how complex and how challenging this game actually is, especially in multiplayer modes. You can carry both a primary and secondary weapon (in the beta version 3.0, which is way better than 2.5), which are basically a rifle/shotgun/assault rifle as a primary and a melee/pistol as a secondary weapon. You can also find clothes, helmets, backpacks, food, water, and did I say HELMETS?! and many more items that will help you to survive longer by providing more space to carry more items, healing and protection. \n\n[b] 2. Pros and Cons [/b]\n\n[b] Pros[/b]\n- Huge sandbox experience;\n- Decent amount of items;\n- Difficult to survive when you are not experienced;\n- In multiplayer, you will actually do anything not do die because the death penalty is high (this can be a con for some, but I really love games where you are actually afraid of dying);\n- The dev takes good care of the game and updates frequently with new content and fixes (about 3 times a week);\n- Good crafting system;\n- You can create your own maps;\n\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n- The community is generally friendly but can be annoying depending on the server you join;\n- Singleplayer gets very easy and boring after some time;\n- The beta branch of the game sometimes experience a few game-breaking glitches that are, most of times, solved quickly.\n\n\n[b]3. Personal Experiences [/b]\n\n>Second day playing multiplayer, naked, because I died in the previous day;\n>Some guys who like to play as cops at stratford point guns at me complaining I'm commiting a crime by walking naked;\n>I get a death penalty\n>A mysterious sniper takes down the tree guys from a distance and I leave the place alive\n>Mysterious sniper turns out to be a guy with a farmer's hat and military gear\n>He gives me some food, water and orders me to carry a few things for him\n>Minutes later, after helping him out a bit, I find a swiss knife and hide it from the mysterious sniper\n>Fearing he will kill me after I have a considerable amount of stuff, but no weapons and that he's using me as a packmule, I backstab him in the head\n>get all his gear and he comes at me, naked and carrying a rifle a few minutes later\n>Rek him again\n\n10/10 would rek the mysterious sniper again\n\n\n>After one week and recently dying, I have a supressed sniper and a few things;\n>I see a group of 3 full-geared guys with nightvisions and rare military weapons;\n>I take one out with a headshot and the others try to hind behind a tree, but they're still in my line of sight;\n>I take the other two guys out and start being called aimbot by the whole group\n>They start to say in the world chat where they died\n>as I'm taking their gear, a guy that barely has clothes hits me with a sledgehammer in the head twice and I die\n>I respawn and go desperately try to retrieve my stuff\n>Give up when I notice there's about 15 players fighting for the loot with snipers, grenades and assault rifles\n\n10/10 would start a war again\n\n\nThere were many other epic moments that I wish I could tell, but my review will get too long!

There's a lot of items, a good crafting system, skills to boost, and a survival system.\n\nMy complaints so far are the zombies are too slow and easy to kill and the map itself is rather small.  I would also like to see some custom server options to address these issues.  Also this game doesn't seem like it would be much fun single player.  The human element really adds to survival games like this.\n\nI do like what I see and so I bought the DLC to throw some money to the dev for his fun, free game.

The next morning I got super lucky and found a rucksack in one of the towers, I then killed the zombies that had spawned there and proceeded to loot. When I got to the tables near the shooting range I found a ghilli suit, next to it was a timberwolf (sniper rifle) and to be honest I was a little too over excited about this. I continued to loot for continues days. \n\nA good friend of mine got this game about a week and a half after and I gave him the server info. Hours passed and he got geared up too. We drove around in the vehicles that we'd collect like nothing could kill us, I eventually built a base for us right next to the military complex (mind that we'd never explored the right half of the map). On day my friend and I had decided to go on a \"vacation\" and go to the airport on the exact other side of the map. Once we arrived at the airport we looted and found a katana, my friend decided that I should keep it, so I did. We had finished looting and started to drive back to our base and my friend went to go make himself dinner, took the wheel and started to drive home. \n\nAs we passed through a town I noticed that the gas tank was nearly empty, so I parked the car behind a gas station and killed the zombies that where near the car as I got out of the car, I accidentally honked the horn. As I was filling up the gas can I started to see smoke coming from the back of the gas station. I rushed back to the car to see a horde of zombies that was attacking the car that had caught on fire. I pulled out my katana and killed about four zombies and my headset roared, my screen instantly turned bright grey. All the zombies where lying dead on the floor, along with my friend. \n\nAs my friend got back he screamed at me and I was just cracking up. \nYou should get this game, it\u2019s amazing\n5/5 exploding cars with afk people inside. \n20/20 zombies. \n1/1 screaming people\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1419717162, "timestamp_updated": 1419717162, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 142, "votes_funny": 138, "weighted_vote_score": "0.838204443454742432", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12744424": {"recommendationid": "12744424", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070093320", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3834, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500990256}, "language": "english", "review": "Solid survival game. I wasn't very keen when I first tried it and felt lackluster because of my lack of knowledge towards the game. I later picked it back up and played with a friend who is miles more experienced than me and made the game fun for me.\n\nI've only clocked about 40+ hours to this game as I'm writing this and I already love this game so much. Definitely in my top 5 games on my Steam library. That's quite a big statement to make, right? (But definitely not the first. Sorry! :P)\n\nCrafting is very in-depth. Can be very difficult and fustrating at times. Takes awhile to memorize them. I'd still have to refere to the wiki every now and then.  The suvival aspect of this game is very challenge at first, but can be very fustrating later into the game, but surely it's miles easier than when we all first started playing this game. You always need to be wary of your hunger, hydration and sickness.\n\nBuilding is very fustrating with the terrain around you. The land might look straight but nope, it's just slightly higher. You gotta find the perfect location. I suggest one should always prepare the materials a day before you want to build so you can focus whole heartedly into the build. Ain't nobody wants to stop halfway of their build to go chop more trees, right?\n\nWith almost *every* game, it's clearly better played with friends. Adds a lot more fun and speeds up process if you're building. I've never played PvP so I can't give you a good picture of that. Longer hours of playing this game is not recommended. Take 30 mins break every now and then. I once played this game 6 hours straight and felt very heavy and burnt out (was building a huge house). \n\nSummary/conclusion:\nIdeal game if you just want to sit down, lay back and kill some zombies for a good 2 hours or 3. Anything exceeding 3 hours might just feel forced and heavy. Building is just a plus to this game. A very big PHAT plus. Nothing is more satisfying than you performing a headshot onto a zombie's head.

But losing everything you've spent hours getting to somebody who simply outplayed you is expected. However, an admin should be playing the most legitimately. This is simply not the case. They will teleport behind you and blast you in the back of the head with a shotgun. They are the most corrupt players I have encountered. And I am including hackers. Hackers in this game are more fun to play against than an admin. Even if you follow all the rules, if the admin doesn't like you for whatever reason. You are going to die. Servers with admins are like having to walk on eggshells. Every person you see could be an admin, and god forbid you kill an admin. Ten seconds later all you will hear is a \"Blam\" now you're dead. Why? Because people in administrative positions in this game are nothing more than squeaking children. Or manchildren who cannot stand to lose.

You can attach silencers,scopes,grips etc, it also has character  customization! which is also a great feature.\n\nGame is going in a good direction the dev know's what he is doing and what his plans are for future unlike the most other \"Early access\" crap the dev's don't pretty much even know what they want to do or are doing.\n\nThe area of the game is thankfully pretty big which give's it a open world feel.\n\nCars really? yes i said cars i did, driving is not the best but it's not worst it's quite fine actually. as well more to come in future such as boat's or maybe even plane's.\n\n2 season's currently one snowy and other your usual normal. But the snow one has a variety of different thing's.\n\nchallenging  many time's you will still have a chance to die even if you already have alot of stuff thus requiring  quick thinking and strateges.\n\nIt has a crafting system which is pretty neat, but you might get a lot of confused at first when crafting thankfully there are guides to help you get through that.\n\nSound's for guns and cars and all sort of that stuff are pretty neat and feel pretty realistic.\n\n[h1]Now let's go to the bad stuff[/h1]\n\nIt's unoptized it might lag in your computer but the dev is always trying to optimize more and more over time.\n\nHackers yup hackers not everyone in this game is a hacker for sure, but you might see a few hackers in your game trying to make you're experience bad but the game now has valve anti cheat VAC which i think has helped ban quite a lot of hackers.\n\nMost of the community is very unfriendly you will see a lot of naked man with knifes trying to kill you for stuff, also i recommend taking a look at you're back you're friend might be trying to......\n\nThe net code is not so good actually, you will experience quite lag on most server's but the dev is always improving it, thankfully it does have a option to play solo.\n\nThe Ai has many problem's. they will sometime's go through wall's and such. \n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nWhat the hell are you really waiting? it's already way better then the other Early Access crap that's been put it to steam these days and even more importantly it's full free and it has a bright future, just click the play button and start having fun!\n\n[h1]One of the best freetoplay game's out there, good crafting,challenging ,skillpoint system and with a bright future.[/h1]\n\n===================================================================\n\n[h1][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/freegiveawaysandkeysforgamers#curation]Click me and follow us as Curator[/url][/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1431515473, "timestamp_updated": 1473469839, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 102, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.834930360317230225", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33368808": {"recommendationid": "33368808", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995735360", "num_games_owned": 1342, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 80218, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1490170134}, "language": "english", "review": "Less bugs than in Dayz", "timestamp_created": 1499506730, "timestamp_updated": 1499506730, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 84, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.818373024463653564", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22383608": {"recommendationid": "22383608", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106933971", "num_games_owned": 160, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 1977, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1510017579}, "language": "english", "review": "I first got this game because it was free and it had zombies, my two biggest selling points.\nAt my first play of it I was thinking \"Look at the state of these graphics, these zombies look like something a child would draw\"\nNow after playing the game for more than the time it takes to get owned by your first blocky zombie, I have to admit that it is probably one of the best free to play zombie survival games available.\n\nAfter leaving the devs to work on it a little more I was very happy to see the changes they had made to what was a good game making it a great game, a more understandable crafting system was added, the level system they had in place was improved upon, more maps have been added as well as more guns and vehicles, and after foraging for berries that made my character trip balls I had completely forgotten about the graphics looking like minecraft and was instead focusing on trying to stop my ass from clenching while being chased by a horde with nothing but my fists.\n\nI'd say buy this game, only it's free, so you really have no excuse not to give it a go.", "timestamp_created": 1460495903, "timestamp_updated": 1460495903, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 25, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804089784622192383", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "12320325": {"recommendationid": "12320325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074796681", "num_games_owned": 118, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 7867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529713389}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros-\n+Great gameplay!\n+Perfect survival aspects!\n+Atleast 50+ hours of gameplay!\n+Constantly being updated!\n+Open world!\n+Map creator!\n+Create your own character!\n\n-Cons\n-(Currently) Not much fun to replay it.\n-Your first military weapon is AWESOME to get but after that you start to find them more and they start to get easy to come across making it less exciting to get.\n-To easy to find weapons.\n\n\nOver all I think I give this an 8/10.

Good combat , its quite decent when you dont get killed right when you are behind a wall (thats the hitbox+ping so if you have like 150 ping or so and the other player has 50 you are gonna teleport and get shot in delay and other things you should know)\n\n                          2. Also has some nice players (exept times when they are toxic) and a big russian comunity (we will talk about russian servers later)\n\n                          3. Raiding. Its so satisfying when you get the gun you wanted and then you go destroy the bases on the server, trust me.\n\n                          4.Its so fun playing with a friend or two or how many you want really , you get caught on to this multiplayer-online game so easily with a couple of friends.\n\nLets get to the \"Bad\" side of Unturned, and its getting spicy:\n\n                          1. The lag is unreal , you need a pretty good pc and a good internet to get over that thing (speaking of framerate and ping) other than that its ok really\n\n                          2. This is gonna have a big impact in your first hours : good players . Unturned has this thing that there are a lot of good players and its unreal when you get killed by a guy and then he laughs in the chat or something.\n\n                          3. \"Rubber-Banding\" i know it sounds stupid but i dedicated this whole point to this. Rubberbanding works like this : You go on any surface and sometimes on rare ocasions you just fall under the map and go back up in a split of a second, and its rare on the surface but on vehicles..... everytime you get on a vehicle you rubberband.\n\n\n                          Oh and about the Russian servers : the admins abuse and give themselves items and can spawn cars\n                          and have huge abused bases so yea\n\nIm getting tired so lets go to the Absolutely Horrible part:\n\n                          1. You can glitch under the map , inside bases , trough every wall and you can make bases under the map. Well , for me its not a bad thing because im into raiding and i can go trough the map and search for bases that way ,or i can go trough walls and doors but i dont do that because whats the point of raiding if you dont break stuff right ?\n\n                           So you wonder why is there a single point to the Horrible part ? Because there are many other horrible thing in this game.
