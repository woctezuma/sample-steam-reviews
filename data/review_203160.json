It's hard to believe that this game is just nearing its six-year anniversary, mostly because it still looks incredibly stunning and it's still one of the freshest action games that you can play. It's a reboot that not only revamped the Tomb Raider series in its entirety, but it also set the bar for what an action game should be.\n\nThe story marks the turning point of Lara going from being a normal archeology major to a hardened badace survivor. The gameplay in this release is more linear in comparison to Rise or Shadow of the Tomb Raider, but that's not to say that there isn't a lot to do. There are tombs to explore, artifacts to collect, challenges to complete, journals to read, and many collectibles to find. You can also upgrade Lara's equipment by finding upgrade components and salvage. There are also three different skill trees to max out, all which provide Lara with powerful benefits to make her feel just that much more like the hardened survivor that she eventually becomes.\n\nWell, What more can i say? Best 20 Hours i have spent on a game. Great History, rich gameplay, Lara is back as a deep interesting badass character.\n\nPD: i can't get tired of play this game again and again.", "timestamp_created": 1549685955, "timestamp_updated": 1549685955, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 8, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516741335391998291", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49300391": {"recommendationid": "49300391", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364815430", "num_games_owned": 89, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1042, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550580968}, "language": "english", "review": "I think its one of the most attractive game ever i played!

The graphics are amazing for a 2013 game and it has excellent environments. The controls are smooth though the combat may feel rough at times. The puzzles were way too easy imo and survival instincts did nothing to help that. \nThere are many quick times events in this tho they are only in the more crucial parts of the game. The soundtrack is amazing too as at times it felt like a friking action movie with Lara climbing up a mountain and the music playing. And of course the story, it is probably the highlight of the game. It is a great narrative with excellent character development leading upto Lara's transformation into a survivalist. The Yamatai part of the narrative was also quite interesting and the document collectables did tell a great story. Don't bother with the multiplayer tho.\nOverall, i would highly recommend this game.

Especially to anyone who has played the series before.\n\nIt has one of the weakest starts to any one game. The intro cutscene is interesting, but after that and the original title reveal, i was already deeply worried and disappointed. Has Tomb Raider been reduced to some brainless quick-time-event hell? Well, let's see.\n\nRemember Croft Manor from the original series? If you put all the puzzles in this game together, they are less clever and less numerous than those of what could be viewed as a tutorial stage.\n\nLet me categorize the \"gaming sins\" that this game exhibits, and no, it is not simply because it has aged 5 years, it's because they were clich\u00e9 15 years ago.\n- Poorly masked loading screens characterized by arbitrary slow walking sequence any time you pass from area to another, including enter \"hidden tombs\"\n- Hidden tombs practically have neon signs pointing toward them screaming \"hey, over here, stupid\"\n- \"Mash E to defeat this enemy\"\n- \"Mash E to turn this crank\"\n- Play \"Simon says\" to defeat this enemy\n- \"Mash left and right mouse button\" to defeat the main antagonist of the game. No, this really happens. Yes, it is the final enemy and the one you've been after all game.\n- Randomly you have to press another button to not fail at grappling. Exciting! (you have 5 seconds to do this, give or take 1) \n- The actions of a lot of the cast are idiotic beyond belief. Let's take for instance the fact that a man has a large open wound on his leg, to which' Lara responds by dragging his unconcious body across muddy, wet terrain. Instead of fashioning a bandage from one of the dozens of flags flapping nearby, she mountaineers up a hill to fetch a medkit from a wolves' den. No really. This happens.\n- Takes control of, and turns your camera without being prompted to do so. This is extremely annoying and should not be done by any game.\n- The game is extremely easy using completely stock, upgradeless bow all the way through... on hard mode. Using any other weapon feels like cheating.\n- You can do the boring assassin's creed \"click on invincibility button then click this other button to instantly kill enemies\" nonsense. Oh, and to add icing to the cake, you're invincible when doing the finisher animation. Even if there's dynamite going off next to you.\n- The combat, and the \"tension\" scenes are so unchallenging, despite all the effort in trying to make them make your blood pump, it's more likely your heart rate will go down when you once again do some \"Simon says\" to not die.\n- It literally teases you with the idea that Lara Croft may die in cutscenes. Twice. We know this isn't going to happen.\n- The enemies are entirely braindead. You could execute an enemy with a shotgun, walk behind a corner, and the guy with the assault rifle in hand will casually walk over in front of you in search of where you might have gone.\n- Amusingly, the enemies also have ESP over your location as soon as you have been spotted once. Machine gunners literally track you through walls.\n- Literally the only interesting looking fight gets Deus Ex Machina'd from your grasp just to come again a bit later as a rehash of an earlier miniboss, which admittedly was the only interesting enemy design in the entire game.\n- Arbitrary collectibles, including GPS cache trackers which' map locations are hidden in ancient tombs. Hmm.\n- You can play arbitrary dress-up with Ms. Croft\n- So many reuses of \"Lara tumbling down a slope\" and \"Lara needs to run away from collapsing building\" things it loses excitement quickly and becomes formulaic.\n- It's practically impossible to die with the sole exception of jumping very occasionally not working properly\n- Lara after killing a few hundred men and commenting how easy it was has a totally tearful moment about someone she barely knew dying. Really. Tonal and character consistency is what, again?\n- A strange sense that's best described as \"Oh, how fortunate, it just so happens i have been given the tools to perform these exact tasks that the scenarios always require\". Such as how everything is wrapped in rope just so you could use your... rope bow on them. \n- Rope bow. I know with these games it's always suspension of disbelief, what with double pistol backflipping tyrannosaurus and all that, but seriously, firing a strangely endless supply of rope by arrow must be one of the most ridiculous ideas. Even moreso that said rope could ever hold Lara's weight.\n- Lara's magical supergrip boots of herculean strength +1. These are a hidden addition once you get the winch. Lara never loses grip or footing when pulling 10 ton loads (with woven rope fired from a bow, i might add) with her... slim, athletic form and a handheld winch. Sorry, what?\n- The plot is eminently predictable. In fact the game spoils its own plot if you actually read what the journals say. Perhaps this is to pursue the idea that Lara knows what's going on, but these Journals are optional, and Lara still knows the records in the journals even if you don't read any journals on your playthrough. By hour 3 you can predict the entire rest of the game, or as i wrote up at the point of entering the radio tower \"Storms will prevent rescue by crashing the plane, in the end Lara will fight undead hordes to save Sam that's in trouble because of turncoat at the last moment to prevent Possession by undead witch queen\", to quote my snippet exactly. It's almost clear-cut plot of the game.\n- Literally asks you to go back and get all of them collectibles that you missed after you beat the game, as if collectibles are somehow gameplay content. Sod off.\n\nIt does have its good parts, with the overwhelmingly negative parts really souring it all down. The setpieces are fantastic, the environment art is great (even if this game's bodycount based on nothing but enviromentally placed skulls alone makes Mao Ze Dong blush), and Lara's motions are (except near ledges, cover ) responsive and perform like you'd expect them to for the most part.\n\nTo summarize:\nOverall it's like a crappy, overdone Hollywood movie. Entirely unique and amazing in how utterly average it really is. 5/10, or 7/10 per game review standards. In a nutshell it is basically an interactive movie with little that could be seen as gameplay, and what there is of that gameplay is a bit disappointing to be quite honest. If i wanted to do nothing but quick-time events, i'd replay Fahrenheit or something. Or maybe play some DDR.\n\n\nYour mileage may wary, for me, this was disappointing. I did not set out to hate this game, and i don't, it's just so disappointingly average. I will not go back to it, and i will likely not play the other games in the series if they're anything like this one. I would not recommend it, especially if you've played any of the originals, but you may enjoy it if you like schlock like it.", "timestamp_created": 1551225013, "timestamp_updated": 1551229413, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.488130569458007813", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49147077": {"recommendationid": "49147077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198322595210", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 227, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 220, "last_played": 1550918117}, "language": "english", "review": "awesome!", "timestamp_created": 1550797690, "timestamp_updated": 1550797690, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503235876560211182", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48787917": {"recommendationid": "48787917", "author": {"steamid": "76561198385025711", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 22, "playtime_forever": 619, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547965612}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is really good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWait till a sale to buy it though.", "timestamp_created": 1549415396, "timestamp_updated": 1549415396, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.522394418716430664", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48821325": {"recommendationid": "48821325", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051816388", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 1296, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549480950}, "language": "english", "review": "Crap game.

For, one I really enjoyed playing it because of its unique playstyle and interesting storyline. This game kept me engaged the whole time and even though I finished the main storyline, I feel like there is sitll more for me to do. And one last thing, I won't be reviewing Multiplayer here, since I haven't played multiplayer yet.\n\n[h1] Story [/h1]\nThe storyline is definitely a strong point of this game. Rather than giving you evrything from the start, you get thrown into an unknown world with little known about the end of the game and the path that leads to it. You find out more progressively as you search and discover ruins to find ancient relics that give more clues about the past. However, you don't have to explore each area to its fullest potential the first time you enter the game, you can also come back to areas with fast travel (except for at the very end towards the conclusion of the game). The tombs you can raid are also kind of like side quests and the relics that you can find, both inside the tombs and around the map give you insight into the area and the main story. There are also several cut scenes that add onto the story and I thought the experience was a lot more directed than a game such as Skyrim, but it still provides a large amount of freedom.\n\n[h1]Level Design/Graphics [/h1]\nSpeaking of freedom and your ability to enjoy the world around you, I feel like this feeds perfectly into another aspect of the game. One of the most important parts of the modern game is the graphics engine with which it runs, as well as how it is exploited to provide the best experience. Though this Tomb Raider is undoubtedly older than what one would consider modern, I still find that it does a good job with shaders and keeping the world immersive. And though the textures, normals maps, and hair physics may not be the best I have ever seen, they are still very good. The cinematic cutscenes feel actually cinematic and everything seems to be smoothed out with animations which makes the experience itself a lot more enjoyable. I also really enjoyed how this game had well worked out levels, beautiful scenery, and a in fact a partially open world experience. Though some levels will collapse, break, and change once you go through them, other parts of the island are simply very enjoyable slow-paced worlds than can be explored once the game is over, which brings to my next point.\n\n[h1] Gameplay [/h1]\nLast, but not least I want to talk about gameplay (please keep in mind this review is directed at those interested in Tomb Raider for the single player experience). The gameplay was fluid and interseting. You have the parkour notion which is one of the biggest parts of the Tomb Raider series. This part doesn't seem to be too difficult in this game, but it certainly isn't easy either. Another portion is the shooter portion where a bunch of guys try to murder you and you protect yourself (because you don't want to die). However, the main part about this game in particular that I like, is that there isn't just one way to go about all this. Somtimes you can be sneaky and try and get around without being seen, or take out any guards before the sound an alarm. Another way is to just run into battle (which I wouldn't recommend). There are so many ways to make your way through the levels. And even though combat was for the most part repetetive, there were some new enemies introduced as the game proceeded, which made the game a bit harder, though not that much harder. The game also introduced new elements to the game as it proceeded which made the experience a bit more dynamic. However, every now and again, the game struggeled a bit with finding where to place the camera, and it gave me some confusing moments. Other times Lara (the main character) would not grab on to the zip line (and thus fall to her death). But other than that I don't really have any complaints.\n\n[h1] Conclusion [/h1]\nShould you buy this game?

This title follows the gritty origin story of Lara Croft and her ascent from a young woman to a hardened survivor as she must fight to unravel the dark history of a forgotten island in order to escape its relentless hold. Being quite the cinematic experience from start to finish, this title quickly pulls you into a fantastic adventure and simply will not let go which is what a truly great game is able to accomplish with the right story, eyecatching graphics and edge of the seat action. Along the way you'll also get the opportunity to explore many tombs and solve some challenging puzzles as well. However, during the course of the game this title did make me cringe alot because this young lady manages to take quite the punishment from all manner of falls, injuries and combat yet despite these horrible events it was very inspirational to see her persevere through it all and emerge such a strong and confident female. This is a truly great origin story that will set the pace for what will no doubt be an excellent continuation of the Tomb Raider franchise.\n\nGraphically, this game is such a stunning showcase of visuals. Even though this title came out in 2013, on ultra settings one could easily mistake this for a \"next generation\" game as it's that gorgeous. The CG and rendering is amazing. The lighting is simply spectacular whether you're scaling the cliffside of some random mountain at high noon or quietly walking around a darkened tomb with a torch. Also, each area of the island is varied and has a uniqueness of it's own. This is definitely not one of those games that uses recycled environments...yes I'm talking to you Dragon Age II. One of my favorite things about the visuals in this title is the fantastic attention to detail and immersion that Crystal Dynamics took. For example, when Lara walks through a forest the shrubbery and foliage moves apart as she trudges through it. You can also hear twigs and leaves snap and rustle as you step on them it's simply brilliant. The game also does a fantastic job of seamlessly blending transition sequences and quick time events into the gameplay. There are no loading screens unless you're entering or exiting the game which is a very nice touch and really shows the amount of polish that Crystal Dynamics put on this title.\n\nThe musical score and sound effects in this game are also exceptionally done. Jason Graves does a fantastic job with the soundtrack appropriately scoring action sequences, tomb raiding as well as dramatic moments of shock and awe which are quite abundant in this game. That \"attention to detail\" that I mentioned before about the graphics in this title definitely extends to the sound quality as well.  \n\nI've been a fan of the Tomb Raider franchise since the very beginning so when the series was due for a reboot I was very excited and rightly so because this is just an amazing title. I originally preordered this game and started playing at release a few years ago but, I'm sorry to say, a few hours into the game I ran into a big problem with the prompts not showing up during the quicktime events which was extremely annoying at the time...I believe I punched two maybe three babies I can't say for sure?! Crystal Dynamics eventually fixed the issue but before that happened I stopped playing and had moved on to something else but I can't believe that it has taken me this long to come back. With its gripping story, dazzling action and added multiplayer I'll no doubt be playing this game time and time again. There are also a multitude of achievements to seek which, if you're a gamer like me who loves to explore and find things, is a welcome addition to the gameplay.

When I first discovered Tomb Raider, I was so enthralled that I played it three times back-to-back, only stopping because my backlog was crying. \n\nThe first thing I noticed were the gorgeous graphics.  There are tiny details everywhere, from incidental carvings that you'll only see for a moment, to the way Lara shivers in the cold, or the way her arms shake with exertion when she lifts something heavy.  The cutscenes are beautifully-directed, and add much to the story.  The voices, music, and sound effects are superb, and every aspect of this game weaves together to form a stunning and vibrant tapestry. EVERYTHING is beautiful, even the ugly things.\n\n[b]Gameplay[/b] is multi-faceted, and you can tailor it to your preferred style.  Want to face your enemies head-on, Rambo-style?  You can do that!  Prefer to explore and learn everything about this island and its inhabitants?  You can do that, too!  My personal preference is option #2 with a healthy dose of I-Am-The-Night stealth and silently removing enemies before they know I'm there.\n\n[b]Collectibles[/b] are many, ranging from relics, treasure maps, and journals to area-specific quests like blowing up old sea mines.  I am a completionist, and one who loves finding every last scrap of story and information in a game, but there is an incentive to find everything possible, even for the Rambo-types... Experience and Salvage.\n\n[b]Experience[/b] nets you Skill Points, which are used to upgrade Skills: Survivor, Hunter, and Brawler.  I won't bore you with the list of possible upgrades, but here's an example of each: Increased Exp when looting, Increased ammo capacity, Dodge skills\n \n[b]Salvage[/b] allows you upgrade your various weapons: Bow, Pistol, Rifle, and Shotgun.  You'll even find weapon parts if you look hard enough, which increases the power of your weapons even more!\n\nThe [b]treasure maps[/b] will show all of the items that will get you to 100% completion on the game, but do NOT show quest items, ammo, orange plants, or salvage, all of which will also add to your Exp & Salvage totals.  Another great way to earn both is by hunting and looting, especially if you go for those headshots I mentioned earlier.  (Bonus experience; ka-CHING!)\n\nWant those treasure maps?  The secret tombs are where you'll find them.  These tombs are pretty hard to miss, since you'll hear a chime play whenever you get close to them.  Raiding a tomb consists of puzzling out how to get to the payoff (large chest, ho!), and generally take about 10 minutes each to complete.  They're a great addition to the game, and the experience bonus is a GREAT incentive to go exploring!\n\nThroughout your travels you'll find [b]campfires[/b], which serve as extra saves points (the game auto-saves), and will also allow you to apply the skill points you've earned and to spend your salvage on upgrades.  They also serve as \"[b]fast travel[/b]\" points, and will allow you to transport to different areas of the map instantly.  Be aware that fast travel is not always available, depending on where you are in the story.\n\nThere are intermittent [b]Quicktime Events[/b] that will require you to... well, to survive. lol~  If you're dexterity-challenged such as myself, I recommend sticking with it -- It's absolutely worth the many times you'll end up dying. ;)\n\nThere are [b]50 achievements[/b] available, 15 of which are for multi-player\n[b]Extras[/b] include Concept Art (too many to count!) and 18 Character Models\n\nIn closing, to me Tomb Raider 2013 is well-nigh the perfect game, blending all of my favorite elements with a hefty dose of knuckle-whitening action, and leaving me with nothing but a feeling of total satisfaction.

The story, the characters, the gameplay, it all goes together very well.  While I have not played any of the older Tomb Raider games for any extended period of time, I can tell that one difference is that in this, Lara seems more human insofar as she actually has emotions.  There are tons and tons of games where the character you play as just seems to lack emotions in many cases, most often combat situations.  They just go and kill the enemies like it's an everyday thing for everyone.  \n\nI've seen people say things along the lines of Lara being 'whiney', but I disagree.  She was just a regular person, and never went through anything outstandingly terrible at the beginning of this game.  What would you do if you were thrown into this situation?  You would probably freak out, and she did, making her character be realistic.  My one complaint is that sometimes it seems like half of her dialogue is some kind of grunt or scream.  Yes, again it is kind of realistic because you and I would likely be grunting and screaming as much as we are talking, but still.  Some of it seems much more high pitched and girly than necessary.\n\nI've seen people say that Lara takes too much punishment to be able to walk and run around.  Yes, this is true, but think of it this way.  She is in a survival situation, the adrenaline would help keep her going.  Besides, what fun would a game like this be if it were 100% realistic?  You get shot once and you're dead?  Boring and frustrating.  She got impaled through the abdomen at the beginning, you want her limping around slowly through the whole game?  Again, boring and frustrating.  Although it can be said that they could have skipped the injury entirely, it actually does contribute towards the game, showing that she initially does have at least an above average pain tolerance, still being able to climb around when necessary while still showing obvious signs of more than just a little bit of pain from the injury.\n\nNow, the story?  Well, it's hard to go into detail of why I like it so much, so I'll put it simply.

I played it several years after its release in 2013, but even almost five years later, it still holds its own in almost every domain.\n\nI only touched briefly upon the earlier instalments in this series, so I won\u2019t be comparing the reboot with the games that preceded it. And just like any game, a reboot, being a fresh start of a series, deserves to be judged on its own merits. In this case, those merits are abundant: I have seldom enjoyed an action adventure game as much as I did here. The story starts promising, with Lara Croft on a discovery towards an almost mythical archeologic place together with a fellow professor, a film crew and the ship\u2019s crew. Things do go awfully wrong very soon, and the game tries to evoke how Lara evolves from your next-door archaeologist into a very tough survivor. Although this is a great concept, it\u2019s not executed to perfection: Lara becomes a battle-hardened killer and an extremely tough survivor way too soon to be believable in any way. Still, I quickly felt a connection to Lara, mainly thanks to the impressive voice acting and some neat details like her \u201cthought by the campfire\u201d which come up now and then. The fact that she looks gorgeous, and far more realistic than in the earlier games, surely did play a role in this as well.\n\nNot that the game aims for realism in any other way: I\u2019ve seldom seen a character survive falls from such heights, and even taking several bullets in a gunfight can\u2019t get our heroine down. The story doesn\u2019t entirely convince in the end: although it is expertly told, it ultimately suffers from too many clich\u00e9s and foreseeable twists. But I doubt that the majority of the people playing a [i]Tomb Raider[/i] game are really wanting a believable story. This game is all about fast-paced action scenes which get the adrenalin pumping and more relaxed exploration, looking for as much loot and collectibles as possible in order to upgrade your weapons (which look great) and to unlock new skills. The feeling of progression is definitely there, and since the enemies become tougher and more numerous, the game never becomes overtly easy despite Lara\u2019s weapons and dirty tricks packing a lot of punch in the final stages of the game.\n\nThe actual gameplay is very smooth and pleasant, both in the combat and in the pivotal exploring (climbing and sliding included) department. Playing with an Xbox 360 controller, Lara felt very responsive indeed. Graphically, this is still an impressive game, despite its age. The island off Japan\u2019s coast comes to live vividly, thanks to some wide views over both ocean and land, and an abundant use of vertical space: climbs, rockfaces and hills feel for once almost real, not diminutive. There are enough options to suit everyone\u2019s taste and the game ran extremely smoothly for me at 60-75fps on my mid-range pc (see my profile if you\u2019re interested in the specs).\n\nI didn\u2019t buy any of the dlc, since it is mostly geared towards the multiplayer element of the game, which seems dead by now (early 2018). So I cannot comment on that aspect of the game. Sadly, for those aiming for a perfect game achievements-wise, a fair amount of those can only be obtained through the multiplayer, so it would be almost impossible to get the game towards 100% anymore.\n\nIn the end, this was a very pleasant gaming experience thanks to the highly polished state of the game, which executes a good overall plan almost to perfection. It didn\u2019t go beyond that, however: the experience probably won\u2019t stick in my memory, as I never felt truly emotionally involved or intellectually challenged. But there is nothing wrong with a game that just wants to be excellent entertainment, after all.\n\n[b]Highly recommended as pure entertainment, but don\u2019t expect (or look for) the deeper meaning behind it all.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1516703889, "timestamp_updated": 1516703889, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 57, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.82611459493637085", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23387098": {"recommendationid": "23387098", "author": {"steamid": "76561198030788488", "num_games_owned": 442, "num_reviews": 102, "playtime_forever": 1954, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1465062254}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][i]Tomb Raider[/i][/b] is a 3rd Person Action Adventure. When the Endurance is grounded on the shores of an island while on an archaeological expedition, young Lara Croft must face the armed and dangerous inhabitants of the isle in order to save her friends while discovering the mystery that has been causing shipwrecks and airplane crashes for centuries.\n\n[b]Pros[/b]: This reboot of the franchise takes the game in a whole new direction where your young and naive character learns to survive against the harsh weather and homicidal community, all the while exploring the island. You train your skills with the experience points you amass from battle and from uncovering tombs and dozens of hidden collectibles, including relics and journals left from the earlier Yamatai Empire and other people who ended up on the island through the centuries. You also collect salvage and parts with which to craft and upgrade your various weapons. The story is pretty interesting in itself, you'll feel halfway between [i]Lost[/i] and [i]Indiana Jones[/i] through most of it. The platforming and environmental puzzle solving is optimized for a game controller, and the rest of the gameplay is ducking and shooting which seems pulled right out of the [i]Uncharted[/i] series.\n\n[b]Cons[/b]: The interaction with the environment can break the immersion in subtle ways, from the climbable cliff sides that are exclusively located at way too convenient locations, to the fact that there usually is only one specific pre-determined way to solve puzzles or reach specific areas. Ammo is also too convenient: loot an enemy who was attacking you with a bow, and it just happens that the only ammo he has is the one for that machine gun you haven't reached full ammo capacity, yet. The more cinematic scenes are often resolved by a quicktime event involving timed or repetitive button pressing. A mere handful of side characters get any development, and there's nothing you can do to save those that will face a story-determined death.\n\n[b]Verdict[/b]: \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2606 - Next on your list!\n\nThis game is much better than I expected it to be.

I just couldn't muster the patience necessary to figure out where to go, what to do etc.\n\nThis reboot has changed all that however - I'm a convert. I've become a fan.\n\nGorgeous environments, lots of suspense, action - and a protagonist that is just perfect in every way.... well... almost. \n\nWhile navigating through, past and over cliffs, rock faces and the like the experience is almost Zen (if it wasn't for Lara's vocal noisiness while doing so). \n\nThis is just one of those games that shows why the gaming industry is turning over a larger profit each year than the movie industry. For the price of a home movie - one gets hours and hours of game play, incentive to revisit and retry - as well as an inspiring story and setting.\n\nThis first entry in the renewed Tomb Raider franchise shows us a younger and less experienced Lara Croft while circumstances force her to mature, dig deep and soldier on.\n\nThere's climbing, exploring, fighting, sneaking, brawling, puzzle solving and much more. \n\nThe reboot is just so much more clear on objectives, navigation etc. Great new game mechanics, controls - the list goes on and on.\n\nThe only 2 things that bother me a little are (and I do mean a little):\n\n* Lara's broken voice when speaking content - even when there is virtually no emotional aspect to it. I mean, this is Lara Croft - the closest thing to a real super girl humanity can produce without resorting to science experiments and / or aliens. She's strong - self-confident, resilient and smart.... Hold the broken-up voice unless there's a reason for it... please... \n\n* Lara is both brawler and sneaker - capable of traversing the most fragile ancient and rotten rope bridges and mechanisms (because she's a girl and doesn't weigh that much). That's fine - but she can't be a brawler capable of melee attacking huge brutes and using ample raw strength to power ancient mechanisms at the same time... I mean it's one or the other.. not both. (No surprise then that in Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider the brawling element has been brought down and the stealth part raised up. Square Enix - realised it themselves too it seems).\n\nWell what the hey - its the first title in a new Trilogy and apart from those 2 minor points - this is a terrific game. Especially now in 2019 - its a real bargain if you've never played it before.\n\nGet the game. Great graphics despite its age, good story, action, thoroughly enjoyable.

Despite my deep and abiding love for Indiana Jones I never had any interest in her games, not until the distant Guardian of Light made it to Xbox Live Arcade. That primed the big Tomb Raider reboot to be the perfect place to jump on the raiding train, especially with its open world features and collectibles that felt included just to appeal to hopeless packrats like myself. I expected a bit of spectacle with it but what I got far surpassed my expectations, both in enjoyment and intensity.\n\nForget the T-rex slaying supersoldier Lara you might remember from your childhood, this one is a humble researcher on an archaeological expedition. The crew of the research vessel Endurance is on the trail of the lost Japanese kingdom of Yamatai somewhere in the west Pacific, and ends up shipwrecked on a mysterious island. Things go south for Lara and her friends very quickly as the island\u2019s ruthless inhabitants hunt them down for their own ends. Pushed to her limits, Lara begins to grow and adapt into a warrior who can fight back against her foes and save her friends from threats both familiar and fantastic.\n\n\u201cPushed to her limits\u201d is not just flowery language, as much as I like being flowery. The hallmark of the Tomb Raider reboot is struggle, illustrating exactly what dire circumstances transform Lara from a bright-eyed scholar to a stone-cold killer. In the first twenty minutes of the game she wades through filthy water, eats a chunk of rebar to the gut, and weathers a brutal assault. The game never really lets up on poor Lara either, reuniting her with friends before cruelly snatching them away, sending aircraft and entire villages tumbling at her, and sticking you with some of the most disturbing death animations around if you foul up certain escapes. Honestly it can feel like a horror game at times if you\u2019re not so good at avoiding the quick-time-event fatalities.\n\nI\u2019m getting this out of the way because it\u2019s an important caveat to an otherwise magnificent game. You\u2019ll need a bit of a strong stomach to get through this one, or at least suspension of disbelief that wading through pits of fouled blood won\u2019t kill a person via disease outright. Lara\u2019s journey is a harrowing and stressful one but it\u2019s also full of incredible sights and setpieces to experience. Early on you have to climb a radio tower and the sequence is done so well that I began sweating and second-guessing my actions, even while marveling at the incredible scenery. The many escapes from collapsing or exploding structures are done just as well, and the story beats that accompany them help build the legend of the warrior woman Lara becomes under your control.\n\nIn terms of control, Tomb Raider plays much like other third-person adventures like Arkham Asylum or Shadow of Mordor. The melee brawls of those games are traded for fast-paced cover shooting and vicious ice-pick takedowns here though, so if you were looking for more blood with your tower-climbing and spelunking this will do the trick. Lara isn\u2019t Rambo (yet) so your best options are always going to be stealthy takedowns and long-range gunning, though later in the game the robust upgrade system opens up additional options for close-combat management that can alter your playstyle. Weapon upgrades also provide you more reliable tools for staying in the middle of the fight and always being the last one standing.\n\nThe real meat of the game is the exploring and, dare I say it, tomb raiding, and in these areas it does not disappoint. The vast island you find yourself in is divided into discrete regions that can be fast-traveled between once you establish camps in them, and each contains a variety of artifacts and notes to turn up. The collectibles are very well done here, providing valuable backstory on the bizarre events in the island\u2019s history and entertaining challenges in reaching them. The tombs themselves are by far the highlight of the game, cleverly-designed puzzle dungeons that will tax your brain at least in a small way before allowing you access to the historical riches within. If I were to lay one real complaint against the game it\u2019s that there aren\u2019t enough of these tombs to raid, both because they\u2019re so entertaining to raid and because it\u2019s the name of the game for God\u2019s sake.\n\nEven four years out the graphics are breathtaking at times, tracing every detail of ancient villages and ruined bunkers in the very grain of rotting wood and cracked concrete. Locations look both real and fantastic, images right out of National Geographic of places you can barely believe exist on the same planet as you. Vast caves, cliff-side temples, and snowy peaks await here, matched with some expert sound design that brings it all together with meaty impacts and threatening booms. It\u2019ll take you nearly twenty hours to see everything this title has to offer, and every minute of it promises to be an incredible journey. I may have missed out on Lara\u2019s early adventures but this reboot does more than enough to make me a huge fan, and eager to see what comes next.\n\n\n\nDid you enjoy this review?

The single player campaign mixes in a myriad of well-crafted elements to create what I personally would define as a 10/10 gaming experience.  There is also a multiplayer mode, which actually has the potential to be fun; unfortunately it has nearly no community, and many of those who do play: cheat (driving away potential new players).  Nevertheless, the game is a total gem for its single player campaign alone.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes playing great single-player video games, regardless of their usual preference in genres.\n\nThe graphics and animations are absolutely stunning, and the soundscape is enthralling and AAA quality.  This is the kind of game that makes it worth having an expensive/powerful GPU.  Drawing from the gorgeous graphics and animations, the game is a heavily cinematographic experience.  This takes the form of both longer, elaborate cutscenes; as well as short, little camera cuts that are integrated right into the gameplay as you explore.  This is all reinforced by an interesting narrative that is well told, with excellent voice acting to back it up.  It is the kind of game that definitely feels like an interactive movie.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics and the gameplay itself are also a delicious blend of tasty ingredients.  There are many interesting and atmospheric areas to explore throughout the game, with various collectibles to find (many of which elaborate on background stories).  There are \u201cpuzzles\u201d to solve ([i]a la[/i] classic Tomb Raider games) and there are secrets to discover.  Besides exploring, the combat/action sequences are also quite fun.  Headshots, finishers, explosive barrels\u2014all the necessities are there.  And as the game progresses you get new weapons and weapon upgrades as well, which spice up the combat scenarios.  There are also high adrenaline \u201cescape\u201d scenes, where you are trying to escape a collapsing bridge, or burning building.  Mixed into all of this, and again drawing on the cinematographic experience, there is also just the right amount of quick-time-events littered throughout the game.\n\nThe game runs on a checkpoint system.  I will always prefer manual saving/quick saving in PC games, but the checkpoint system in this is pretty flawless.  Collectibles save instantly, so if you die you don\u2019t have to recollect them.  Also the checkpoints are extremely common; so if you are learning how to win a fight, you basically always restart right at the part you messed up.  There is also a decent fast-travel network, so you can return to gather collectibles at any time (including after beating the campaign).\n\nLastly, as I alluded to, there is also a multiplayer mode separate from the campaign.  I have played it a bit and can honestly say it has the potential to be pretty fun.  Unfortunately barely anyone plays it.  Although, like most games, it isn\u2019t [i]completely[/i] dead; you will be able to find some people on here-and-there.  There is a high percentage of cheaters, though\u2014 which is also common for low-population multiplayer games.  In short, I wouldn\u2019t count on the multiplayer mode adding any value to your overall experience of this game.\n\nSo, in summary, [b] Tomb Raider (2013)[/b] is an outstanding game, with several great features contributing to the experience.  It is an amazing blend of adventure and action with a strong narrative and beautiful aesthetics\u2014 a truly \u201ctop-shelf\u201d game.  I recommend it to all gamers who enjoy great single-player experiences.   Even if this style of game isn\u2019t usually in your wheelhouse, this is the kind of game that creates new fans of the genre.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1442003321, "timestamp_updated": 1449555643, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 444, "votes_funny": 34, "weighted_vote_score": "0.867814302444458008", "comment_count": 11, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12611967": {"recommendationid": "12611967", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048587276", "num_games_owned": 1393, "num_reviews": 77, "playtime_forever": 2122, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1413145765}, "language": "english", "review": "my entire life i have dreamed of a game where i could play as a dainty british girl getting tortured, slapped, killed in many gruesome ways, and who despite suffering from severe hypothermia, never wears anything more than her tank-top. \n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game (this is the first TR game I\u2019ve played so I can\u2019t compare it with Lara\u2019s previous outings) and, a few gripes aside. Visually, this game is very striking. It also has a pretty good AI and enjoyable combat. The voice acting is good, and the storyline, despite being conventional, is better than average. The mix of exploration, puzzle-solving, combat, and parkour-style platforming is well-balanced and satisfying and gives the game a much broader scope than most. A couple of the QTEs are FUCKING annoying, but on the whole the set-pieces are well choreographed, impressively designed, and fun to complete. The save system is also a little frustrating, especially if you happen to mistime a jump halfway between checkpoints (sadly us PC gamers are used to this). Overall TOMB RAIDER is an impressive example of excellent game design and is immensely enjoyable to play.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1414166539, "timestamp_updated": 1414166539, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 274, "votes_funny": 152, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835390567779541016", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29925713": {"recommendationid": "29925713", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078193056", "num_games_owned": 150, "num_reviews": 68, "playtime_forever": 2509, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1486852932}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][i]\"A SURVIVOR IS BORN\"[/i][/b]\n\nIf anybody was ever tired of highly-skilled Lara with muscle body, big booty, tight shorts, tighter shirt and tightest weapon holster with dual barretas, then guess what, we got exact opposite. Thin, small, young student with no relevant skill which  main protagonist of action game should have. But yay, we still have that tight shirt and jeans. After a while, you already know what's going on. Lara is war beast who knock the f. out army of occultists with wide variety of arsenal.\n\nStory is banging. Opening even more. Starting things up with awesome cutscene where is our beautiful new rebooted Lara reading on the boat and boom, you wake up in some cave where ugly mountain bastards wants to eat you or kill you or both. If you pay attention, you might say the whole story was pretty predictable but surprises are way way way up and there's lot of them. Singeplayer will last you for estimated 8 hours, (if you go for 100% then maybe 12) but to be honest at least for me, going for 100% was nowhere near to being annoying. It is one of very few games where I really enjoyed getting collectibles and challenges. \n\nPlaces are absolutely beautiful, from deep raining jungles to underground caves, from sandy shipwreck beaches to town from post-apocalyptic movie to amazing ancient asian spots, tombs, houses and villages. Tombs are pretty easy. Maybe first one will be kinda medium, until you realise how the game works, but rest is really obvious and few of them you'll finish within two minutes. Stealth option was funny too.\n\nMultiplayer is just to extend your gaming experience. It's nothing significant, after a while it gets really boring, but it's worth putting multiplayer time in to finish achievements. Sometimes when you get nice crew, it can be fun, and some matches you will really remember, but as you can probably see, its understandable that it's not made to be big as BF, but just so Square Enix can sell DLC. \n\nThis reboot was really great idea, and I am so glad that they did it. Lara is beautiful, it's fun with her and Tomb Raider 2013 is true success. I can't wait to finally play Rise of the Tomb Raider and I wonder if it'll be close to this, or even better!\n\n[b]Bonus Point: Lara Croft[/b]\n[h1]Rating: 10/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1487095316, "timestamp_updated": 1487095316, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.797193944454193115", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14750348": {"recommendationid": "14750348", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063191116", "num_games_owned": 855, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 1998, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1425588453}, "language": "english", "review": "Really loved this game -- perfect level of difficulty.

In this game however, Lara is NOTHING like she used to be, she is weak, scared, unexperienced and had just graduated. She does not go out raiding tombs and treasures, because she wants to, she just gets thrown into this life by destiny. When she and her comrads sail to the island Yamatai to film it and discover some 'treasures' for money, their ship gets caught in a mysterious storm and everyone gets seperated. Now it's up to you, to find your friends and escape this island. Throughout the game you need to learn how to hunt, fight, craft new weapons, survive... and sometimes raid tombs... in order to get out of there alive. Lara quickly learns, that the island and it's presence is her greatest enemy. The animals are not the only ones, that want Lara dead, but also an ancient army (which I'm not gonna go into more detail here) and fearsome hunters who inhabit the dangerous island.\n\nTomb Raider is a solid singleplayer third-person action adventure with a catching story, great gameplay and beautiful visuals. The gameplay does remind alot of the 'Uncharted' series, which is not a bad thing, considering the games are both similar. A multiplayer mode, similar to 'The Last of Us' multiplayer is also included, but not a big highlight and definately not needed. If you think of buying the Game of the Year edition, there's no need in doing so, since it only comes with one 5 minute tomb and TONS of useless multiplayer skins, which noone needs anyways.\n\nI strongly recommend 'Tomb Raider' to everyone who likes action adventures like 'Uncharted' and games with great gameplay and graphics.\n\n9.5/10", "timestamp_created": 1419990504, "timestamp_updated": 1420026170, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 93, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837694287300109863", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8085365": {"recommendationid": "8085365", "author": {"steamid": "76561198016223585", "num_games_owned": 532, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3541, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1449092557}, "language": "english", "review": "I have never been this pleasantly surprised by a video game before. Unfortunately, this is my first Tomb Raider game, so these aren\u2019t the thoughts of a diehard fan. Therefore, I can\u2019t tell you whether the franchise took a step in the right direction or not. I was personally anticipating Tomb Raider to be a copy of an Uncharted game, and I don\u2019t think that my inaccuracy has ever brought me this much happiness. In fact, comparing this with Uncharted is rather silly, because the similarities between the two games end rather quickly. Tomb Raider is its own game with its own unique features. The gameplay is everything I could\u2019ve asked for, and more. You gain XP and purchase skills that are divided into three different branches, or \u201cskill trees\u201d. There are many different ways to gather resources, which allow you to upgrade the 4 weapons Lara finds throughout her journey, each of which have unique advantages in combat. In addition, challenges and collectables are introduced with rewarding incentives, which will encourage you to dive into these fun optional features. While the characters may not have these remarkably appealing personalities, Crystal Dynamics gave us an incredibly strong protagonist. Lara Croft is a clever and tough woman who plays the \u201chero role\u201d perfectly. Character detail and animations are nearly lifelike and the cut-scenes are cinematically brilliant. Buy this game, you will not regret it.\n\nThe Good\n+The new Lara Croft\n+The captivating setting\n+The island is the star of the show\n+Lara's world feels brutal, dangerous and frightening\n+More depth than you expect\n\nThe Bad\n-Cliched characters, flat dialogue\n-The slow start", "timestamp_created": 1387316958, "timestamp_updated": 1387316958, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.767592728137969971", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38096352": {"recommendationid": "38096352", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096083752", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 1350, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545373786}, "language": "english", "review": "PROS\n- Excellent Storyline, plays out almost like a movie. The storyline for Tomb Raider made me care about each character and what happened to them throughout the duration of my playthrough. It never felt tedious and was excellently written. Loved it.\n\n- Open World is a plus. I really liked how the developers made the environment open for exploration in each level, which really encouraged you to look around for secret areas, items, etc. that would spawn around the map.\n\n-Fighting is well programmed. Fights in Tomb Raider always felt smooth, and through the style of the game, it put YOU in the driver's seat on how to engage enemies. The variety of weapons in the game match these various styles too, and they sometimes even have uses outside of fighting, which I found interesting. \n\n- The Goal in the game is clear. Tomb Raider is a perfect example of great script writing in this sense. I never felt like I was aimlessly doing something in the plot. I felt like every action I made had some meaning that pushed me closer to the end of the story.\n\n- The game is challenging, but not overly so. Playing my first run-through of the game, I had no idea what I was getting into. At the same time, the game can be very conducive to new players, teaching them the mechanics of each tool early off in the game without deliberatly giving you a tutorial that has no meaning to the game. That being said, I died many times, but quickly learned how to avoid the situations that had killed me in the past. \n\n- Game Environment is gorgeous, VERY immersive. Each scene has a picturesque feel to it. You can be running through an environment and be awestruck from just looking out into the distance. You feel like you're there beside Lara Croft.\n\nCONS\n- Won't hold your hand. This game can be very conducive to new players, but I was frustrated with certain levels in the game and their difficulty. This game will not hold your hand, whether you like it or not, it'll throw you into the deep end with no floaties. Prepare yourself!\n\n- No substantitive DLC! The DLC for Tomb Raider consists mostly of player skins, but I would've loved to see another few missions added as something a little extra. I understand the studio that made this game was planning to make Rise of the Tomb Raider and didn't want to creatively drain themselves, but I would've loved to see some post-story missions or thematic material. \n\n\nThis has to be one of the best games I've ever played. If you're still looking to buy Tomb Raider, it's always on sale during Steam sales, but it is always worth it to buy this game. I literally have nothing bad to say about it functionally or about the story.

That femme fatale from a certain adventure series? You know, the buxom beauty that has a starring role in nine games, two films, and countless other media? She's the one with Barbie's warped proportions, Batman's agility and cunning, and whose confidence and grit are as palpable as her impressive dimensions? If you do remember, then you certainly haven't played the latest Tomb Raider series reboot by Crystal Dynamics. After playing this game, you will have forgotten everything you know about the old Lara Croft.\n\nThis new and younger Lara is vulnerable and uncertain of herself. She cries and shows genuine sorrow when she loses a friend. She laments killing animals that she hunts for sustenance. Her every physical action painfully reflects her lack of experience, her desperation and dread at the seemingly insurmountable odds laid before her. Yet she perseveres through her story, dealing with the physical pain and emotional anguish, and grows all the better for it. Lara goes on a tremendous journey, and takes us right along for the ride.\n\nThe story kept me interested throughout, action was pretty intense and didn't feel over the top or overused. I really liked the character development of Lara and her progression towards becoming that bad ass chick from the original games. I noticed some people complained about narrative and story not making sense, noticeably during scenes of Lara being upset and all of a sudden on a so called 'killing spree', I felt that the developers did as a furthering of character development in such a way so that Lara had to always be on her toes so to speak. Those reviews seemed to have a bias or an unwanting/not caring to understand Lara's journey so don't let them put you off. Graphically a beautiful game to witness, I had to slow down at times just to catch some cool shots of the island in its various weather conditions. Cinematic scenes, just wow tbh. The use of weapons was well integrated into game play and non seemed unnecessary, the bow is one of the most satisfying weapons I've used in recent games and it almost feels wrong when not using it.\n\nTo sum it up, just buy it.

It was very apparent to me that a lot of time and care was put into the making of this excellent game.\n\nThe visual effects were stunning.  Cutscenes were directed very well and provided for a lot of great screen shot moments.  Character animations were realistic and played smoothly.\n\nThe writing was done pretty well for an Origin story.  The plot mostly takes a survivor story spin with a small amount of adventure thrown in.  The story is linear, though once you get access to fast travel, you can go back and get collectibles you may have missed earlier.  The game took me roughly 20 hours to complete on normal difficulty settings.  Voice acting was also very good.  I really enjoyed seeing Lara starting out so green and inexperienced and then grow into the seasoned adventurer that she eventually becomes.  The game is very tough on the young Lara and I could not help but feel bad for the character as she gets battered and bruised repeatedly throughout the story.\n\nCombat takes a cover shooter approach.  The game does provide some small amount of stealth activities to take out enemies silently but few options exist to stealth past encounters entirely.  There is a simple progression system that allows Lara to aquire skills that improves combat and survival.  There is also a system that allows upgrading and improvements to weapons that Lara acquires throughout the game.  I found the progression to be extremely well-paced throughout the linear plotline, much like the Arkham series of games.  In addition to the shooting, there were a good number of well-placed QTE activities that mixed things up a little.  The maps were very nicely done and made full use of all dimensions to provide for lots of platforming opportunities.  The game auto-saved progress regularly and had very generous checkpointing so that you will not have to redo much at all after a death.\n\nI only had a couple of issues with the game overall...\n\nThere were a few crashes as I played through the game.  Especially if I ALT-TAB frequently.  My system is well above the recommended specs but found that reducing settings helped a little with the sudden crashes.  The game still ran very smooth when my settings were maxed-out but those occasional crashes did get annoying.\n\nFor an action/adventure type game, it was a bit heavy on the action and a little light on the adventure.  Not quite what I would normally expect from a genre that is heavily inspired by Indiana Jones.  Shooters are one of my favorite types of games but this one felt a little too \"shooty\" for my tastes.  I was not keeping a tally, but Lara would have claimed a body count the size of a small army by the time I completed the game.  Boss encounters were also very lacking.  I would have liked to have seen more tombs that had something to do other than simple physics-based puzzles to complete and ways to complete more sections of the game through stealthy non-lethal means.\n\nOne other minor complaint are the death animations.  I already had a hard time seeing Lara put through some of the tortures of this adventure, but a few of the death animations were a little over-the-top.

On one side, it's an amazing game, no doubt about that. It's an action adventure game, with platforming and puzzles, similar to the Uncharted series. And you can see it almost as a competitor. The story tells the origin of Lara Croft as a tomb raider, through survival. The game has a decent story, characters and music, good graphics and fluid gameplay. What i really liked were the unique sequences that this game has, which are plenty and intense. If you only play it for the story, it feels more like a movie, which isn't that bad here. If you try to do 100%, the extra exploration needed will make it feel more like a game. The game quality is consistent, being great from beginning to end. Now for the other side of the coin. To put it simply: this isn't a Tomb Raider game. The main series games are also similar, but they put a lot of attention in it's puzzles. I'm not gonna criticize the straight platforming of this reboot, but the lack of challenging puzzles really hurts this game. You'll solve most of them in a few minutes, and many are optional. Really? Even the hardest ones won't take more than 10 minutes to solve (there were 2 or 3 of these). And to make things easier, the game has an in-game hint system, showing where you need to go, which objects you can interact with, and more, effectively guiding you through the whole game if you like. There should at least be a mode in which this system was permanently disabled for purists. Basically, the main challenge of the previous titles are gone, creating an identity crisis. So, should you play this game? Absolutely. It's an amazing title, gripping you the entire journey.

The plot is pretty good, and I'd say it shows Lara's evolution from a sort of bookworm archaeologist to the badass we all know and love; of course, she still isn't all badass by the end of the game, but she's now ready to actually take on some big adventure.\n\nSo, to actually talk something about the story, it begins with Lara and friends getting stranded in an island somewhere in the Pacific during a huge storm. While at first it seems to be a pretty normal island, with a few ruins and such, soon she encounters some of its inhabitants, who seem to be cultists of some sort, and strange things begin to happen whenever Lara and her friends try to leave the island. I won't go into much detail here, but I'd say the story is very good.\n\nThe gameplay seems to be more action oriented rather than being about platforming puzzles and such, but I'd say that's better, considering the game's plot. There's a few different weapons you'll find along the way, which you can upgrade in different ways, along with several tools to help you navigate the different environments. Even then, there's also a bit of platforming here and there, and there's plenty of collectibles to find, some of which give a lot of background to the game's plot, although they aren't necessary to understand the story.\n\nWhen it comes to level design, I'd say they did a great job when making the island. There's many different areas you can explore along the way, from jungles to old WWII bunkers, and even ancient Japanese castles. You can also return to some of these areas later on, when you've found new tools, in order to discover new secrets.\n\nThe game also has a multiplayer component, but that's something I don't really recommend. I don't see why some developers and/or publishers feel the need to add a multiplayer mode to games that don't really need it, but it's there, and I played it, so I'll give my opinion. Pretty much: it's a buggy piece of crap. Now, I'd say it could be somewhat decent if they had supported it after release, but after all this time, there's still plenty of bugs, pretty much nobody plays it, not to mention that it has that stupid levelling system where you unlock better weapons the more you play, meaning that new players have a hard time when matched against those in higher levels, which will happen a lot when only a handful of people play the MP. Personally, I think the resources spent in developing the MP would have been better spent in improving the SP, which is still good, but could have been better.\n\nWell, I think that's a wrap for my Tomb Raider review.

I'd elaborate but its truly in almost every game.

The death animations are really something to behold. \n\nThe game is actually fairly linear in nature; however there are multiple optional Tombs serving as puzzles to solve for new items and XP. There is also fast travel between camp fires but in all honestly this is just a way for you to go back and get to a new tomb or area after acquiring a new ability or tool and serves no real purpose into the narrative and honestly takes away from it slightly as the pacing of it doesn't really make sense. \n\nThe story is decent, its quite riveting the first time, though I don't find it that engaging the 2nd time around. Personally I find the ending ludicrous and takes away from the real actual relatable situations that arise from being trapped on an island full of cultists.

I would like to give it a try at some point in time, just to see what its like and if its as good as single player.\n\nYeah I know my review is not so great, but I just wanted to share that I finally finished this game, but not 100% completion, as I still have multiplayer acheviements to be had (I may not get any of them anyway) as multiplayer may be dead.\n\nAnyway the game was fun and I thoroughly enjoyed it, even if I did die plenty times.", "timestamp_created": 1450715950, "timestamp_updated": 1450715950, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 82, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.804849743843078613", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17114405": {"recommendationid": "17114405", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989376417", "num_games_owned": 400, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 710, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1437244172}, "language": "english", "review": "Tomb Raider (2013) is a pretty solid game in most cases but also a bad Tomb Raider game. The combat feels great, the graphics are excellent, the mouse and keyboard controls are fluid and the game is very optimized. The story is pretty predictable and not that great. Despite being a Tomb Raider game, the tombs are optional and the puzzles are quite easy to solve. \n\nThe platforming has been made much more simplified now that Lara can stick to almost anything she comes near. There is some exploration in the areas but not as much as it should be. You can go back and revisit the areas since the island is \"open-world\", but there isn't much stuff to do there aside from collecting some boring collectables and the optional tombs. \n\nAll of the weapons in this game feel great. I liked how the guns evolve when you get enough parts. For example, the WW2 submachine gun you start with turns into some sort of AK-47 and your trench shotgun turns into a SPAS-12 combat shotgun. The weapons sound great aswell. \n\nThe game sometimes tries too hard to be cinematic, especially at the beginning of the game which is a scripted QTE fest. Actually, there are too many scripted sequences in the later parts aswell which got dull pretty quickly. The QTEs for keyboard are terrible. They use these stupid icons mainly instead of just showing the actual damn key. Sometimes the game does tell you which key to press but it should have been like that in the first place (I would have preferred no QTEs though).\n\nLara goes from innocent girl to stone-cold killer very early on in the game. When she does her first-kill, she goes like \"OH MAH GOD, I KILLED SOMEONE\", then the next thing I'm pulling 360 n0sc0pe headshots with the bow with ease. The survival elements are not very deep at all and feel kinda phoned in. There is hardly any resource management since you can find a ton of ammo on the ground and Lara can regenerate her health. \n\nThe combat is your standard over-the-shoulder third-person-shooter that you've seen in the last few years, though with a bit of jumping here and there. It's pretty good for the most part. \n\nThe game holds your hand too much, however. The games treats you like an idiot with giving you forced hints while you're doing the (easy) puzzles. Thankfully, the survival instints feature (Which highlights the stuff where you're supposed to go) is optional. \n\nDidn't play much of the multiplayer so can't say much about it but who plays a Tomb Raider game for the multiplayer anyway?\n\nOverall, the Tomb Raider reboot is a decent TPS but not a good Tomb Raider game at all. The game would be a lot better if had more exploration, a bigger focus on tombs, little to no QTEs and scripted mumbo jumbo and less hand-holding. Even with all the flaws in the game, I still enjoyed playing it.  \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1437256325, "timestamp_updated": 1437256325, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 51, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778770625591278076", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13003671": {"recommendationid": "13003671", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085998065", "num_games_owned": 520, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2698, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1443035571}, "language": "english", "review": "[b] Good:[/b] \n\n[i] intense [/i] gritty story.\n\nbreathtakingly beautiful game.exquisite detail.\n\nbackground music is awesome.voice acting is good too.

From the revolutionary first game, through its progressively mediocre sequels, eventual revival with Legend and then repeated downward spiral, it\u2019s not always been the most successful of franchises but nonetheless is one of the most enduring throughout its failures. With Tomb Raider 2013 (hence force just \u201cTomb Raider\u201d or \u201cTR\u201d) Crystal Dynamics has done away with many of the hallmarks of the series, leaving something behind that some may argue bares little resemblance to its predecessors but in my eyes is the exact incarnation of what Tomb Raider needed to become relevant again.\n\nGone are the lengthy, puzzle riddled tombs, the emphasis on absurd level designs, lackluster combat, and an enormous set of breasts standing in for a protagonist. In their place we find a tightly knit, extremely cinematic, blockbuster action game that completely overhauls what we consider TR to be and turns it into something far more compelling and polished than the series has ever been.\n\nAs an origin story, TR is as much the story of Lara Croft\u2019s ascension from curious but naive archaeologist to the incredibly self sufficient treasure hunter we know her best as, as it is the harrowing account of an expedition gone south as Lara and co become stranded on an island populated by what could most easily be described as the criminally insane. It\u2019s a darker narrative than we\u2019ve ever seen with Lara, with moments that made me legitimately cringe and could very nearly be categorized as horror, but it\u2019s also the deepest and most personal.\n\nLara is a fragile and vulnerable character, but not a helpless one, and in watching her grow and overcome so many trials she becomes an immensely relatable and empathetic character. She keeps your attention from cheap sex appeal, but for the fact she\u2019s a believable and well acted character; flawed and broken by the events around her, but never beaten by them. It\u2019s a shame the others characters didn\u2019t receive nearly the same level of development, though for what they are they provide enough of a narrative hook to be memorable. If I had any issue with the story, it\u2019s that it disappointingly falls back on the series trademark supernatural elements in the latter half, which came off as almost silly in such a realistic and brutal world. But even then, the plot moves at such a quick pace and so much velocity that it remains almost absurdly compelling the entire way through, making it easy to gloss over an occasional lack of exposition to just enjoy the ride.\n\nWhere TR has seen the most growth over past games though, is in the refinement and broadening of its mechanics. Combat is no longer a tedious lock on affair, but made up of brutal, intense encounters that are consistently evolving and requiring you to constantly think on your feet as enemies react and attempt to flank you from all sides. For this the auto cover system works shockingly well, causing you to crouch behind objects when enemies are nearby and easily pop in and out as you pop enemies off. It\u2019s fast and feels incredibly fluid, never once breaking on me as similar systems have in the past, but instead given me one less thing to worry about so I can focus my attention elsewhere.\n\nThis would mean little if the gunplay wasn\u2019t excellent, but to Crystal Dynamics credit they\u2019ve crafted some of the most satisfying third person shooting of any game I\u2019ve played in recent memory. Your arsenal is limited, but it\u2019s composed solely of the weapons you will actually need, chief among them an amazing bow which works brilliantly as both a stealth weapon and a powerful killing machine if you\u2019re spotted. It defines the combat in TR and gives it its own identity that I\u2019ve yet to tire from.\n\nThe other most prominent part of the experience is the Uncharted-esq platforming (I tad ironic considering where that game got most of its roots), which if anything is scaled back from what it used to be but is made up for with how intuitive and fast movement has become. There is no extraneous platforming to be found here, but a focused and dynamic moveset that works with the environment to direct you where to go and gives you no trouble getting there. It really cannot be overstated how much of an improvement this is over the often confusing, terribly imprecise level traversal of even Crystal Dynamics\u2019s prior TR game, Underworld. I never once had to fuss with the camera or controls, which is more than I can say of even most of TR\u2019s contemporaries.\n\nWrapping this altogether is an open world that finds the sweet spot between so large it becomes overwhelming to navigate, and too small you lose all sense of scale. It\u2019s distinct and enjoyable to explore, packed with secrets that actually mean something and are used to flesh out the world past the core plot.\n\nAnd less you somehow forget, this is an absolutely astonishing looking game, with a recognizable art style and some incredible environmental effects. Watching a building be torn apart by violent winds, or fire engulf a ship is jawdropping, even more so when it\u2019s viewed through a wonderfully cinematic camera that escalates even simple scenes into something you can\u2019t look away from. It\u2019s simply gorgeous, and has been scarily well optimized so much so that my mid-range PC barely flinched as I began turning settings up well past what I expected I could.\n\nTomb Raider might not be what you expect, but it\u2019s a game that deserves all the praise and recognition it has received. Crystal Dynamics has managed to once again salvage a series and brought it to a height I didn\u2019t think was possible. It\u2019s a stunning adrenaline rush, that does as much for Lara\u2019s character as it does for rejuvenating the franchise, which by the end had left me with a lack of words past a barely audible \u201cwow\u201d.\n\n[b]Disclaimer: this review covers only the single player portion of Tomb Raider.[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1411075784, "timestamp_updated": 1411075784, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 37, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.750490784645080566", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16659718": {"recommendationid": "16659718", "author": {"steamid": "76561198103887272", "num_games_owned": 205, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 15426, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438355190}, "language": "english", "review": "Tomb Raider is a reboot of the adventures series featuring a fearless woman named Lara Croft.\nLara Croft is a 21 years old English archaeologist that recently graduated.\nLara appears to be a weak unexperienced survivor that gets scared off easily but that didn't stop her passion for adventures.\n\nThe story takes place with Lara and her companions the \"Endurance crew\" that sail to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai island, home of the legendary shaman queen Himiko.\ntheir ship gets into a mysterious wreck during a storm that comes out of nowhere and leaves everybody separated.\nAnd now its up to you to regroup with your crew and escape the island.\nIn order to escape the Yamatai island and stay alive, you will have to learn the tactics of fighting, hunting, weapon crafting and mostly survival.\nThe Yamatai island is filled with wild animals that want Lara and her crew dead along with a huge army of the Solarii Brotherhood that are after them.\n\nTomb Raider is a both singleplayer and multiplayer third-person adventure action game with a great storyline along with beautiful visuals, nicely done gameplay and optimized very well.\nMultiplayer is very similar to a game called 'The Last of Us' but most the focus that has been put into this game is on the Singleplayer side.\n\nIf you're a fan of adventure singleplayer games with stunning graphics, gameplay and non-stop action then you should definitely pick up this game.\nIf you're thinking of picking up the GOTY Edition, i would only recommend it if you're a fan of multiplayer skins (Which appear to be pretty useless to me)\nThe only DLC i would recommend is the 'Tomb of the Lost Adventurer' which adds an extra Tomb to the storyline that could take around 5-10 minutes to complete.\n\nOverall, i absolutely fell inlove with this game even though i am not a fan of 3rd person or singleplayer games.\nThis game absolutely amazed me and i strongly recommend this to everybody.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1435093629, "timestamp_updated": 1435093716, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 99, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.819549977779388428", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42398914": {"recommendationid": "42398914", "author": {"steamid": "76561198307800474", "num_games_owned": 172, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1282, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527746673}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]What an amazing game![h1]\nI don't think I've ever finished a singleplayer experience so quickly, with the exception of Dishonored (one of my all time favourite games for comparison).

It's hard to believe that this game is just nearing its six-year anniversary, mostly because it still looks incredibly stunning and it's still one of the freshest action games that you can play. It's a reboot that not only revamped the Tomb Raider series in its entirety, but it also set the bar for what an action game should be.\n\nOf course, the name Lara Croft is known far and wide; from her triangle-boobed early PlayStation days through to her more recent top-down style adventures. This simply named Tomb Raider reboot puts an entirely new spin on a character that most of us have known our entire lives, by shedding new light on her personality and background. Accompanied by her close friends, a mentor, and a \"celebrity\" archaeologist, Lara's first expedition begins on Yamatai; a fictional lost island in the Dragon's Triangle off the coast of Japan, where she is in search of an ancient lost kingdom. However, her ship, The Endurance, soon gets struck by a violent storm and sinks, leaving the group stranded on the hostile and uninviting island with no means of escape. Even worse, a mysterious curse seems to thwart any and all attempts to leave. It's up to Lara and her crew to figure out exactly what is preventing them from leaving Yamatai.\n\nThe story marks the turning point of Lara going from being a normal archeology major to a hardened badace survivor. The gameplay in this release is more linear in comparison to Rise or Shadow of the Tomb Raider, but that's not to say that there isn't a lot to do. There are tombs to explore, artifacts to collect, challenges to complete, journals to read, and many collectibles to find. You can also upgrade Lara's equipment by finding upgrade components and salvage. She ends up getting decked out with quite a few weapons, a pistol, rifle, shotgun, and her bow, although later games see many variations of the weapons that can be used. There are also three different skill trees to max out, all which provide Lara with powerful benefits to make her feel just that much more like the hardened survivor that she eventually becomes.\n\nAs it has been said many times over, this reboot of Tomb Raider is exceedingly dark and gritty; there are even moments where you'll find Lara covered head-to-toe in blood. The graphics still hold up exceedingly well for a game that's six years old. More importantly, the gameplay still feels fresh even after over half a decade; this is thanks to the many twists and turns that the plot takes, players never know exactly what they're in for just around the next corner. It's also thanks to the many unique action sequences and interactive scenes.\n\nSo, is the reboot Tomb Raider worth playing even still in 2019? Absolutely, it's quite possibly one of the best games that you could play in your lifetime. Even if you're not a fan of any of the previous incarnations of Lara Croft or the gameplay style of the original Tomb Raider releases, this total retcon of the series is sure to win you over. If you've already played this reboot and you want to breathe some fresh life into it, it's worth picking it up again on PlayStation 4; the system uses the speaker on its controller to add an entirely new level of depth to the experience. It's a hell of a steal on sale for $3.74 CAD on Steam, but despite how good it is you should be hard-pressed to pay full price since the multiplayer portion has long-since died.\n\n[h1]Rating: [b]5.0/5.0[/b] - An astonishing achievement, this game must be played.[/h1]\nThe Horror Network [url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/28221963/]Curator[/url] | [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/thehorrornetwork]Group[/url] Click for Gore", "timestamp_created": 1549392047, "timestamp_updated": 1551850264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.76211017370223999", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22870462": {"recommendationid": "22870462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112810429", "num_games_owned": 1763, "num_reviews": 341, "playtime_forever": 4534, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462751479}, "language": "english", "review": "Yet another Croft girl. We've seen them quite a lot from the time the first game of this franchise was released, and \"re-boot\" of the year 2013 was not the first one. However, it is still a 3rd-person view action/adventure game with female heroine, who knows her ways around archeology and survival in the \"Indiana Jones style\". And, it is a good game, even if flawed a little, but quite decent overall.\n\nThe pattern has changed seriously this time. Now it is much less a puzzle with \"how to get there\" problem, but quite ample action with \"shoot often, kill many, remorse nothing\". It is not bad, but looking too much Uncharted. Which is somehow amusing, as it was Naughty Dog who looked at TR games as an example. But let's not trouble ourselves with the quiz \"who's copycat whom better\". Much less climbing and jumping and much more shooting for one, damned quick time events on every corner for two, and not-bad, but quite dead multiplayer for three (with many achievements for MP which you'll probably never unlock fairly). Sounds almost enough to nail the coffin, right? But I called TR'13 the good game, despite all those things. Why? 'Cause it's still a fine adventure! And if you're not troubling yourself too much with 100% achievements in every game, I really recommend you to try out this re-rolled Crofty, as there are not so many comparable titles anyway (and Uncharted stays with Sony, without any chance to climb on the PC mountain so far).\n\nThe setout of the Tomb Raider'13 sounds very similar to the one of Far Cry 3 (which was released just a few months earlier to the TR game). Lara and her team crushed occasionally on the distinct island filled with unfriendlies, and need to find a way out. You'll find a bow and will be hunting animals for resources. And, by all means, you'll get guns - and quite enough mean and ugly targets to unload them. Ah, and don't forget semi-open world, where you can search for numerous \"artifacts\" and other collectables, as well as some small tombs to scavenge... on your way to save your team and yourself.\n\nLet's talk about strong and weak points.\n\nThe engine and visuals - are really good. Especially I enjoyed the visualisation of fire and wind - they are, like, alive - which is good for atmosphere in the game - and for dynamic puzzles, which are (lucky we) not just \"push the button, turn the lever\". I enjoyed the sightseeing, the climbing and hiking was quite rewarding... if they were not haywired by the not-so-great controls and framerate drops, which happened too many times, especially when I played the game for the first time, right after release. Now the framerate seems fixed (or at least, much more stabile), and I'm get used for controls, more or less. Still, the count of my deaths out of flawed controls (during some tricky jumps usually) and for low framerate during damned QTE (like with AlphaWolf) - really freaked me out so many times.\n\nThe story and characters - another strong point. It's like the \"Lost\" serial - only with bunch of sane and (pro)active people. Even your enemies are good and solid - in their way. They are not just respawning mobs without any logic or reason. On the contrary, they're all well-placed. I've seen better scenarios, sure, but only in gems like Bioshock or Witcher - which are surely of rare breed.\n\nBattle system - not exactly vivid, but good enough. You sneak, you hide behind the obstacles, you perform silent attacks with bow/pistol, then enemies discovers your location, hell breaks loose, you see the rain of lead, you've got molotovs flying right on your head, your cover breaks after some shots... Yeah, it CAN be fun. I especially liked the bow - it performed much better than in Far Cry 3 or Assassin's Creed 3... or even Skyrim. Much more arcade than in the Mount'n'Blade, of course, but still quite fun. And yeah, brings assosiations with the Hunger Games Katniss tool for some, sure. Never liked that franchise... but I do like bows and prefer them to crossbows (and occasionally to rifles) even in real life.\n\nAs of semi-open world (I call it so for the TR still a narrative-driven game, even if it allows you to return to previous points to collect miscellanious stuff you've might missed earlier)... The tombs are quite optional, and, as much as I've enjoyed puzzles in there, the sequence when Lara complete the challenge in the tomb... is really out of order, with that big chest, wow-hush on the first occasional trinket - and that's all! Take your bonus to supplies and return on your quest! Not really rewarding, if you ask me. On the contrary, the more basic artifacts Lara discovers on her way feels much more suiting her Archeological agenda, as well as adding more colours to the world around. That's great, if only transiently. Yet, overall trinket searches not really providing additional fun, being somewhere on the level with feathers from Assassin's Creed franchise... unless you're really looking for more lore on the Lara Croft's universe, and really reading diary pages - a thing so rare now, when those pages scattered among all games, and so little people actually pays any interest to them anywhere...\n\nAs we're talking pro/contra, I'll repeat about two downsides: the quite-dead multiplayer, with something about 15 out of 50 achievements related to it - which means no fair complete. And bugs, mostly based on the not-so-good optimisation. Some of them were fixed... like the occasional drops of framerate. But in that process of updating, I've got my savefile broken - with the 18th level MP charachter, and 100%-completed story... So I had to repeat all the process, without \"Newgame+\" and with MP character zeroed...\n\nWith all said, my mark of the game is 7.2/10. It's a neat dramatical adventure, worthy re-work of the title. Yet some of the gamedesign decisions (like the emphasis on QTE or Lara's quick transformation from bookworm to mass-murdering angel of death) - and bugs problems, along with stupid \"one slot saves everything\" policy, which isn't good even on consoles - all this holding me praising the game higher.

It has semi open-world, decent stealth mechanic, fast and fluid combat, simple story with great graphics and voice acting.\n\nKeep in mind, I don't review the multiplayer aspect, this review only covers single player.\n\nThe first thing that appeal to me is the graphic. It's excellently designed and implemented. While some don't make sense like Lara's TressFX hair (right, her stylish and silky smooth hair after she jumps into the mess anyone?), the scenery and environment are indeed breathtaking. If you can max out your in-game settings without any FPS drop, do it, you'll be amazed. The cutscenes / movies are also excellent looking and pretty realistic.\n\nOh, you can test your rig in-game, it has its own internal test to see how good your rig to play the game and adjust the setting accordingly.\n\nIf you have good speakers, plug it in, the combat feels very realistic with surround sound. But most of the time, though, you won't pay any attention because Lara's pretty weak and goes down after few shots, and it's better to run away when you enter the combat and fight from afar or even better kill one by one by stealth from the beginning. I have to give a prop for the voice actors, without them the game would be less than complete - a good VOs is always welcome for any kind of game for me.\n\nGameplay has similarities with Batman Arkham Asylum. While the combat is extremely on a different side, the stealth mechanic has emphasis here, playing with many gadgets (Hook Claw vs Hook Arrow) and the limited scope of open world remains the same (Asylum is locked to a prison, here you're in an island of nowhere). Tomb Raider has fast travel feature in form of camps, though, it is handy to access all side-quests that require backtracking if you're too far ahead. There's essentially a mirror of Batman's Riddler Quest here in form of collectibles. You'll have no shortage hidden objects to collect to complete your collections and achievements. And yes, some are really well hidden making it harder, probably you might want to see Youtube videos for guide or something. I've given up collecting everything though, lack of dedication of my part. :)\n\nEvery game has its flaws, and Tomb Raider is no different. A few notable downsides are, for example: boring, repeated QTEs where some require you to trial and error and so when you die in that particular QTE you're forced to watch the previous cutscene. Yeah, damned QTEs, and even Resident Evil 6's doesn't do it this way.\n\nAnother one is the hunting mechanic, it doesn't really add much value to the main game. So you hunt the wild animals and loot some resources, then what? Nothing more. It feels pretty detached in my opinion, it's only there for the sake of it.\n\nLara is also even better than Batman. There's no way a girl like her would be able to run overnight without fatigue, fight many strong armed men simultaneously, and after receiving open wounds she can still fight like monster. Not to mention Lara's shotgun is still fully functional even after submerged in many of her QTEs in the river/water. While it's a downside definitely, it's a side effect of the game being linear and thus no realism. \n\nOn PC, the game's still better played with Keyboard + Mouse. I've tried using Controller for several hours and the results are miserable. The game requires your aim skill when you fight, controller can't do that, there's no auto aim here. If you insist though, you can plug your Xinput capable controller and set it up in-game menu. Dinput doesn't fare well and even requires some specific hack to make it work properly, so not recommended.\n\nFor side perks, it has achievements if you're into it and cloud save which is a must for all games nowadays and it has saved me several times from losing my progress. You can also jump into the multiplayer if you like, though I never touch it since Tomb Raider is only all about single player for me.\n\nOverall, this is a proper AAA, something that I can really recommend despite some flaws. Most of the times the game would be on heavy sale, so get it if you like the genre.\n\n8,5/10", "timestamp_created": 1505529796, "timestamp_updated": 1505600299, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.741536796092987061", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26537858": {"recommendationid": "26537858", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980991915", "num_games_owned": 156, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 12028, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1522442662}, "language": "english", "review": "Just completed the story and I can truly say that I am not dissapointed.

I played few hours of either TR2 or TR3 on Sony PlayStation. I cannot make comparisons to previous games in the series for this reason alone. Tomb Raider (2013) caught my eye because of the high praise and low price. \n\nIn short the game is 3rd person shooter with climbing, light puzzles and strong story. If you don't like these features, don't buy it, otherwise it's worth the money.\n\nFirst of all I must praise the game for being very well done. The graphics are great and the game works like a charm. I encountered total of one (1) minor glitch during my gameplay that lasted 19 hours. The gameplay is solid although it becomes a somewhat boring in the end. Sounds of the environment, characters, guns are all on par with the rest of the product. Music I can describe as lacking, since I cannot remember a single moment from any of the songs played in game, not even the main menu theme if there was one. \n\nThese things in mind  we can move to the reason why I wanted to write my own review. \n\nTomb Raider tells us a story about female tomb robber Lara Croft who gets stranded on an island with some of his friends and co-workers. She gets lost from her friends and they all soon meet other shipwrecked people who attack and capture them. Croft must then begin the long journey to free her friends and eventually try to escape the island that holds a dark secret.\n\nEssentially the story is about her growing up to be like her father. What I understood from the game, her father was some sort of an adventurer or a tomb raider alike. Though Lara in the early part of the game seems like your average city girl, she quickly learns to survive in the hostile environment of the island and tackle with its inhabitants. The game begins with a chapter where she learns to hunt, make fire and avoid enemies. A couple of chapters later she's shooting mercenaries left and right and suddenly doesn't have to care about hunger, cold or anything she just learned to avoid. She then starts immediately adopting new guns and gadgets with no trouble.\n\nThe major problem with the story is that the gameplay itself doesn't seem to relate to it. The conversations with other characters, Lara's monologues and some cutscenes portraits her slowly growing up to become an survivor, yet the actual gameplay throws show much against her in the first few hours that there isn't much to improve later on. About midway through the game she has escaped from atleast three exploding/burning buildings, killed about a hundred mercenaries and climbed to the highest point of the island. After that she just survives those things again and again. And the game does exactly that, more enemies, more exploding buildings and more climbing. There's just too much of it and because of this the game loses its novelty already in the midway of the game. Thanks to varied level design, the game manages to stay mostly refreshing right until the last chapters. The story also manages to stay within its darker shades and there's no comic relief characters or over-the-top sidemissions to alter the atmosphere.\n\nLastly I must mention that this game constantly reminded me of Far Cry 3. And because of comparison that I would consider the problem mentioned above only a minor flaw. While the games have quite many similarities in their setting, gameplay and story, Tomb Raider does it all a lot better. Tomb Raiders story is the center of the game and while the gameplay diverges a bit from it, the game in its entirety manages to stay credible compared to other video games. It could be a bit better but it could be a whole lot worse. Like exploding monkeys and killing alligators to make bigger wallet kind of worse.", "timestamp_created": 1483317395, "timestamp_updated": 1483317440, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.655454814434051514", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22807007": {"recommendationid": "22807007", "author": {"steamid": "76561198152760885", "num_games_owned": 10109, "num_reviews": 397, "playtime_forever": 441, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1484737459}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Basic Information[/h1]\n[b]Title:[/b]  Tomb Raider\n[b]Developer:[/b]  Crystal Dynamics\n[b]Publisher:[/b]  Square Enix\n[b]Genre:[/b]  3rd Person Action\n\n[h1]General Impression[/h1]\nA wonderful reboot to an already classic franchise. 2013's Tomb Raider was a most pleasant surprise to all fans of the series.

Tomb Raider was different. This campaign is one of the most exciting campaigns I have played in years, and that puts this game on my all time favorites list with great games like Star Wars: Battlefront (2004), and Halo Reach. I could not put this game down. Around every corner there is something to fine. Unfortunately, I grinded the games story and managed to complete the story with an overall game completion of 68%, but there is no doubt in my mind that I will not play this game again soon. I played the game on the hardest dificulty, and although I died a couple times - seven times to be exact - The game was so much fun that I didn't care about me dying when I got rushed by 20 autoaiming enemies.

It has outsdandingly fluid, cinematic, and rewarding third-person cover-based combat, and is set in a cool, mysterious environment that makes it feel like a sexier version of an Indiana Jones movie. \n\nIn the end, the question of whether or not you should buy this game comes down to a few items:\n\n+ Do you care about the Tomb Raider IP in general? If so, then that\u2019s a pretty obvious point in this game\u2019s favor!\n\n+ Are you interested in gender politics in videogames? If yes, then this is a title you should probably play at some point, to form your own opinions on how Crystal Dynamics dealt with the Lara Croft reboot in a contemporary context.\n\n+ Do you like cinematic games with quicktime events? If yes, you\u2019ll really like this one, but if no it\u2019ll probably kinda piss you off.\n\n+ Do you love platforming and puzzle solving? If you do, then you may or may not be disappointed here. Tomb Raider's platforming is so cinematic yet automated that playing it is kinda like watching someone else play a puzzle platformer that looks like it\u2019d be a lot of fun if they\u2019d quit hogging the controller.\n\n+ Are you a fan of third-person cover-based combat with a touch of stealth? If yes, then you probably don\u2019t want to miss this one. If not, then do not buy this game!\n\n+ Is it worth the money? Tomb Raider is fun, but will only take you about a weekend to beat, and it has little replay value.

My favourite rendition of Lara Croft so far. \n- Exciting cut scenes and quick time events.\n- Plenty of collectables and some hidden tombs. You can unlock a skill later in the game that marks where the collectables are on your map (in case you\u2019re a completionist). \n- Although the story is quite linear, you\u2019re allowed to backtrack and revisit different locations (again, helps with 100% completion). \n- Good balance between stealth and aggressive gameplay. The skill trees help you customize Lara to fit your preferred style. \n\n[h1]Negative:[/h1]\n- Puzzles felt too simplistic. I felt like the tombs should have been more challenging. \n- I would have liked more tombs. Lara is known as the tomb raider after all. \n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nTomb Raider has been a celebrated franchise for years.

The graphics are stunning from the diverse environments to the character models.  The game does a great job at showcasing your beautiful surroundings.  Tomb Raider has an excellent story that marks the transformation of Lara Croft the young expeditionist into Lara Croft the deadly tomb raider.  You really get a sense of the internal struggle Lara faces having to transfrom into a killing machine.  The cut scenes are emotionally intense and well acted.  The game is very cinematic and sometimes you feel like your watching a movie.  The gameplay is addrenaline packed and the third person perspective suits the action well.  Climbing and traversing the terrain never felt so fun and dangerous.  Melee combat is smooth and brutal.  Your trusty pickaxe used for climbing makes a nasty weapon.  Although there are not a ton of different guns to use, each has its purpose.  They do a good job of making Lara feel powerful and a destructive force.  Especially when you utilize the bow and arrow effectively you feel like your Legolas from LOTR.  There are alot of unique caves, tombs, and other locations to explore.  There is the odd puzzle that is never too difficult but adds a nice element to the game.  There are tons of collectibles and lore to unearth. The multiplayer though non active is entertaining if you can find some people to play.  All in all this is a must play for any gamer and a truly enjoyable and memorable ride.\n\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/31699029-The-Wisdom-of-Oz/] For more quality reviews, check out and follow my curator page!

I expected a lame rehash from a stale franchise. Instead, I\u2019m happy to announce that Tomb Raider is an incredibly fun and intense experience that has resurrected Lara Croft. \n\nI played the original years ago and while it was fun at the time the formula got old quickly and I could not get interested in the sequels. It was roughly 90% intricate, drawn-out puzzles & platforming with 10% miserable combat sprinkled in. What they\u2019ve done is rebalance the game mechanics so it focuses much more on combat (which is oh-so-fluid) and the puzzles & platforming are more of a side dish. I think this works because it keeps the game moving along. \n\nFor example, there are optional tombs you can raid, but they are very small areas with only one puzzle that won\u2019t take you more than 10 minutes to solve. This is a little disappointing, I\u2019ll admit. I would like to have a little more meat to the puzzles, but I will take the short ones over getting bogged down in a 45-minute labyrinth. \n\nRPG elements have been introduced, as well. There is a lot of optional stuff you can do in this game which will yield experience to make Lara stronger through special skills as well as finding \u201csalvage\u201d which is used to improve your weapons in certain ways (more damage, less recoil, etc). Special journals can be found, too, which help to unravel the mystery of the island you\u2019re on. \n\nAnother brilliant touch is how they\u2019ve tweaked exploration. Each area has several sets of secrets to uncover but you don\u2019t have to find them all before you move on (some will require items you don\u2019t have yet, anyway). You discover campsites as you play and can fast travel between them. This lets you focus on having fun instead of feeling obligated to gut an area\u2019s secrets right away to avoid a lengthy backtrack to an earlier area. It makes things so nice. \n\nThe game is gorgeous, too. Environments are beautiful & smartly designed so they feel very open with lots of nooks & crannies to peek in and usually multiple paths to traverse around obstacles. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, combat is fluid and thrilling, the exact opposite of how it was in the original game. Head shots with fire arrows never get old, and the AI is smart. Ranged opponents will throw fire bombs to flush you out of cover or shoot guns at you while melee opponents will zip line in to close on you. And there are so many gratifying ways to kill them. Stick an arrow shaft through their neck with your hand at close range, dig your climbing axe into their back for a stealth kill, hit a guy right as he\u2019s about to throw dynamite resulting in a friendly fire explosion, etc. \n\nThe story is very good, too. Games rarely make me want to play to find out what happens next anymore. Usually the story is something bland & serviceable to keep me level grinding. I really like the narrative in TR, though. Quite unrealistic, of course, but still enjoyable. \n\nAnd if you\u2019re concerned, keyboard & mouse controls work just fine. This is not one of those sloppy console ports that is unplayable w/out a gamepad. \n\nThe only knock I have against this game is the use of quick time events. QTEs are something I want to see go away and never come back. I am tired of the \u201cpress E to awesome\u201d gameplay mechanic. However, Tomb Raider doesn\u2019t rely too heavily on them and they are at least presented in a very dramatic way, so don\u2019t listen to any commenters saying the game is nothing but cutscenes & QTEs. The beginning is admittedly slow and has a lot of them, but that\u2019s because you haven\u2019t gotten your weapons yet. Once you get armed, you encounter them a lot less. The QTEs don\u2019t ruin the game and only end up being a very minor annoyance. \n\nThere is also the obligatory multiplayer mode that all video games are apparently required by law now to include. I don\u2019t know anything about it and I will probably never play it. It\u2019s an extra thing if you want it, but know that the single player campaign is not lacking at all. \n\nIf you like action games, you should definitely pick this one up. Tomb Raider had lost several steps over the years but is now running like a more polished version of Playstation\u2019s Uncharted series, with better combat & storytelling.

Along with the main storyline you follow, you can discover sidequests in the form of secret tombs hidden in the area. These are optional to complete, but do contribute in more knowledge of the main story its origins when you manage to solve that tomb. Other than that the game has challenges for you to achieve while you play. The graphics and details of the game make the game look realistic, you feel like you are actually in the movie itself. On the island, you are also free to roam around and gather XP by killing animals or solving tombs. Whenever you level up due the XP, you gain skill points which can enhance your combat attacks/methods, increase survivalbility or some other features which enhance your gameplay overall, such as gather more ammo from enemy corpses. Whenever you are stuck in the game, you are lost or such, you can press the Q button (by default) anytime to find out where you need to go in order to progress in your game. What is also nice about this game is the way it offers to combat. You aren't always forced to fight in melee or fight in ambushes. You can also be stealthy and make stealthy kills, avoiding ambushes. The game also offers a variety of weapons and tactics to kill an enemy. In comparison with the previous Tomb Raider games, the gameplay is a bit different but nicer in my opinion. The tombs and puzzles, which were forced to solve in order to progress were implented in this game as optional tombs. Making it easier to progress to those whom had difficulties with this. While also granting those whom loved these parts the oppertunity to do this.[/i]\n\n\n[b]\u00a9 Siviria Ashariel 2017[/b]", "timestamp_created": 1487204142, "timestamp_updated": 1511374947, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 22, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696472346782684326", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24302409": {"recommendationid": "24302409", "author": {"steamid": "76561198014321081", "num_games_owned": 133, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 669, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1468432513}, "language": "english", "review": "I wish there was another option to select, rather the \"Yes\" or \"no\" as to whether or not I liked it.\n\nPositives - It looks amazing, graphically maxed out it's extremely beautiful, the temples look great, the statues brilliant, the Samurai's even better, nice orchestral music to keep you interested. There's one scene especially where you sneak around a temple full of Samurai's its very raiders of the lost arc, I smiled through the entire thing, very cool.\n\nCons - Lara gets the absolute crap kicked out of her, to the point it completely ruins any immersion, she falls from ridiculous heights, gets her face smashed in, stabbed a few times, shot, burnt, you actually start laughing out loud, it's like an over the top female John Wayne impersonation, I'd say at least 50% of cut scenes she almost dies. \nStoryline, it's almost cool, you get a very nice \"lost\" the TV show feeling, in fact, the entire thing is loosely based around it.

Sigh.\n\nThis game, seems to of gotten endless positive reviews, and I totally understand why, I think the biggest reason it failed for me, is it could of been a brilliant brilliant game, and instead I just wanted it to end. If I had any say in this game, I'd remove 90% of the fighting, in fact I'd make sure she never kills anyone, other then the samurai zombies, so we could in some way connect with her, it makes no sense at all, I'd say she piles up a body count of over 200 people? All to save Sam? I'm just not sure she's really the good guy in this game. I'd give Lara more of a free role, to make her own way from one side of the island to the other, not have EVERYTHING mapped out for you, every single step you take there's a virtual sign post saying \"GO THIS WAY!\". I'd make the puzzles require more then an IQ of 10 to complete, as they are sooo unsatisfying.\n\nAll in all, this is a beautiful game, but the irregularities in the storyline, poor generic sign posted climbing and dreadful fighting make for a rather lack luster experience.", "timestamp_created": 1468440907, "timestamp_updated": 1468440907, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 25, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.685189664363861084", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13586683": {"recommendationid": "13586683", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067401412", "num_games_owned": 115, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 902, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1493494309}, "language": "english", "review": "Out of college, Lara will embark on the Endurance, the ship captained by Captain Conrad Roth, for his first great expedition.

Well in comparison to the over-produced Angelina Jolie debacles, any competently produced movie offering would look favorable but what I'm trying to say is that Tomb Raider is one of those AAA games that are incredibly well-made but without any hooks that would constitute a must-buy. As gripping as Story Mode gets, from a game design standpoint you're on a linear path with QTE challenges, scripted non-repeatable enemy encounters and a few puzzles so easily solved they're barely worth mentioning. It's an interactive movie where you are the hero.\n\nYou are Lara Croft and you are fighting for your survival. You can't actually starve to death or catch your death in cold and you regenerate from bullet wounds after a short period of time so in this case \"survival\" means tons of enemies out to get you and all you have are a bow and arrow. And a pistol. And an axe, a combat shotgun and a machine gun. Kinda undermines the whole point, really. Combat is actually the bees-knees with flawless controls in a cover-and-shoot environment against determined foes out to plant a machete into your skull. Your melee options are rather lacking, leading to tense gameplay where one fights desperately for every inch of personal space against maniacs with firebombs trying to flush you out from cover.\n\nI guess the \"hook\" of this game is that it's a Tomb Raider game. Tomb Raider fans will buy this product sight unseen and call it a shining beacon in the franchise. That's fair, but what about the rest of us? Well if you're like me and you barely touched the series, Tomb Raider is certainly more accessible than any of the previous Playstation installments. It's downright easy, even. The reboot mixes realism and fantasy in equal measures so as to build genuine dread at your desperate plight while still being respectful to the setting established throughout previous Tomb Raider titles.\n\nNeedless to say, Tomb Raider multiplayer is dead in 2016. I tried it, had a nice 15 minute conversation in the lobby then wrote that part of the game off. I cannot recommend this game at full price but I couldn't endorse simply watching a Let's Play either. And because story is such a central part of the product, every scene that you witness prior to play takes away some of the value from your purchase. Price it as you would a blockbuster, with popcorn. I'd like to thank Tonton Mori for the giveaway as I finished this during a long three day weekend and I cannot say that I regret the experience.\n\nFinally, a word needs to be said about the gruesome death scenes. Those squeamish over violence against women should probably give this title a pass.

Well, I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say it's one of the best games of this generation.\n\nYou start off as Lara Croft, in which you experience many  endeavors that unfold while playing as her. She specializes in whatever you want her to be, whether its using a bow and arrow, weapons like a pistol and shotgun, or just to boost up your survival skills.\n\nWhile you are Lara, you can do many things, such as climbing on reachable rocks, jump from one place to another, and of course hunting down everyone trying to kill you.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic. It's not much of an open world, but seeing all these tombs and ancient temples give the game a great and immersive experience. It also makes the game ooze with atmosphere without any technical hiccups or frame rate drops, which sometimes ruin the experience. You don't need an amazing graphicss card to play this. I have a GTX 660 TI with a Core i5 2500k @ 3.3ghz and it runs very smooth.\n\nThe enemy variety is smart and will hunt you down. Unless you're not spotted, you can use your special bow and arrow and attack enemies from a distance without any guards alerting one another. It is quite fun, and gives the game a great sense of pace.\n\nI like the game because it never tries to hold your hand, and it makes you want to figure out everything on your own. The game can get pretty intense with cutscenes and the (\"run for your life\") quick-time events. There's just enough of everything to keep this game interesting for the player.\n\nThe game also has multiplayer, but not many have been playing it.

I first played this game on the xbox 360 when it came out in 2013 when i was 10. Since then i have beat the game multiple times on the xbox 360, xbox one, and the ps4. After getting this gifted to me from a friend back in march, im just now getting to it and while i was able to beat it in a day, that speaks more about my memorization of the game rather than its length.

But apparently this is different - and better - than the past games. I really have no comparison on that point. It reminded me of a cross between Batman Arkham Asylum/City and Assassin's Creed: lots of running around in a big map, getting into a bunch of fights that often require precise timing (QTE's), some platforming/puzzle stuff, and collectibles. Yey. \n\nThe gameplay is good at what it does, and I managed to keep playing it despite my distaste for QTE's and platforming (the former because its boring, the latter because I am bad at it. XD). Story-wise, it is fine, if somewhat predictable (took me about 12 hours to finish the main story). Sadly, some of the characters I like die horribly and the characters I really don't like die horribly to something other than me, so that was a bit of a shame. But aside from that it is a fun little adventure where you go to alot of freaky looking places, fall onto hard surfaces alot, and eventually make it out by doing a crazy run away from danger only to end up in a place similar to where you just left. Pretty sure Lara would have died half a hundred times during the course of this game if it was reality and not a game. But anyone who has played a fair amount of games is probably used to that by now. XD\n\nOverall I thought it was a good game, even if I could do without the QTE's and the sequences where I have to run or slide down a dangerous area dodging and jumping over stuff. Everything aside from that was fine and mostly enjoyable. So if what I have described here sounds like a game that you would enjoy, then go ahead and pick this up. If not, then I guess don't. Enjoy a crazy adventure on a strange island filled with freaky people for you to shoot at! :o", "timestamp_created": 1420670584, "timestamp_updated": 1420670584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.653689861297607422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42850630": {"recommendationid": "42850630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198228315844", "num_games_owned": 171, "num_reviews": 45, "playtime_forever": 629, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514216277}, "language": "english", "review": "The girl version of uncharted\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1529442787, "timestamp_updated": 1529442787, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.678603053092956543", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29810940": {"recommendationid": "29810940", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034766576", "num_games_owned": 1252, "num_reviews": 578, "playtime_forever": 1236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521044232}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good game.

I saw this title, enjoyed the trailers, and decided to give the series another shot.  To be frank, I was blown away.  This game pulls you in from the moment it begins, with an engaging storyline, beautiful graphics, and compelling voice acting.  The gameplay is solid and offers enough exciting combat and immersive exploration to satisfy any fan of the adventure genre.\n\nTomb Raider 2013's story reveals Lara Croft's origins and is based on one of her earliest adventures on a mysterious island.  The player is taken on a thrilling journey that uncovers Lara's true potential and destiny to become the Tomb Raider.  Her evolution from the inexperienced young student to the courageous, gritty survivor/explorer is brilliant.   As the game progresses, there are so many details- from gradual changes in Lara's facial expression to the tone of her voice and behavior- that reveal her gradual transformation.  In the beginning of the game, one can sense her fear and uncertainty, but by the end, a budding confidence and resolve.\n\nThe gameplay is rock solid.  Combat is fun and exciting, and the player is rewarded for skillfully dispatching enemies with bonus experience.  The weapon upgrades are awesome and fun to use (my favorite was the grenade launcher and fire arrows).  Exploration is a blast, thanks to the fluid and natural way the player navigates the treacherous terrain, be it rock climbing with the ice axe or daring leaps across bottomless chasms.  There is a decent amount of side questing involved for the completionists out there as well, usually involving finding hidden historic artifacts or notes/memoirs.  There are sporadic button prompt mini-games but they don't feel tacky and aren't overly difficult.  My only complaint really is the simplicity of the optional tombs and the trivial rewards at the end of each one.  The devs could have put a little more effort into making these spelunking experiences feel more \"epic\" and rewarding, rather than just a means to find some treasure maps and weapon upgrades.\n\nControls are great.  I played this using a keyboard/mouse and had a very enjoyable experience.  The controls are, by default, very intuitive so I didn't even have to change anything, just played the game.\n\nGraphics are amazing, especially for a game from 2013.  Excellent graphical options as well, and the performance is great, no issues for me and my system is a bit outdated.\n\nSound is excellent, but music was mediocre.\n\nI spent a good 15 hours to complete roughly 80% of the game, including the main story, all the optional tombs, and a good chunk of the side quests.  If I were a true completionist, I can see this game lasting maybe 18-20 hours or so.\n\nIn short, Tomb Raider 2013 is one of the most immersive and enjoyable adventure games I've played in recent memory, a classic in my book.  Grab this game NOW if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did!
