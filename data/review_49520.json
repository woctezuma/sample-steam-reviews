It does have some minor plot twists and plenty of funny moments. Sadly the story gets quite annoying and repetitive as you must go through it 3 times in order to reach true end-game status (this is more of a fault with gameplay than the story). This affect is worsened if you want to max-out each of the individual characters (more on that later).\n\nGameplay-wise Borderlands 2 is an FPS with RPG elements. There are different characters, a diverse range of weapons and gear, so you can play how you want to. Harder difficulties of the game do restrict you due to a rock-paper-scissors system of gear, where certain things are effective against some enemies but not others. Late game has some balancing issues with Money (an in-game currency) becoming literally useless (this is because you will rarely find gear worth purchasing from a shop compared to Borderlands 1, so your money will just build up until it reaches $99,999,999) and Eridium (another in-game currency) has limited uses once you have maxed out. As for the combat, it is enjoyable with a levelling up and skill point system that allows you to play how you want especially with all the possible gear combinations. There is a slight flaw in that the hardest difficulty can prove to be very difficult if you struggle to find new gear, since enemies will be exactly your level, meaning you always need to have gear your level, but then that gear must also be strong enough to be worth using. This makes the game become a chore as you do the same thing over and over to get new equipment, but then this levels you up, meaning that you need to do that again; this cycle repeats until you are max level, and it really subtracts from the experience, not to mention that reaching end-game status already takes long enough.\n\nIn terms of aesthetics, the game has a sort of comic book look to it, so fans of hyper-realism will be disappointed by this. The game seems a lot more cartoony, as it feels a lot jollier than the first game, making it lose its wasteland-ish feel, in addition gore in particular doesn't feel as satisfying as the first game (either that or I need to seek serious medical attention).\n\nYou may or may not have heard of gibbed, which is a save editor. Many in the community will judge you for using it, however i personally believe it is up to the player. I was glad that I could keep my Xbox 360 saves, but have no interested in bypassing, actually putting effort into obtaining gear. Gibbed has also a purpose of saving players the trouble of having to play through the story numerous times in order to reach end-game status on multiple characters.\n\nOverall a fantastic game, that is simply a must have for people who enjoy RPG games and/or FPS games.", "timestamp_created": 1551798051, "timestamp_updated": 1551798051, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.54356849193572998", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49162464": {"recommendationid": "49162464", "author": {"steamid": "76561198361238284", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 6307, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 82, "last_played": 1551006926}, "language": "english", "review": "haha funny game", "timestamp_created": 1550870264, "timestamp_updated": 1550870264, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.550251424312591553", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48788298": {"recommendationid": "48788298", "author": {"steamid": "76561198171729138", "num_games_owned": 22, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 1431, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548377278}, "language": "english", "review": "Still an amazing game after 7 years!

I bought the Handsome collection for about 15 bucks when it was on sale and it added a lot to the game. The main story is fun, and the side missions can be really crazy. Same goes for all of the DLC content. However, a downside is that you will spend a lot of time grinding. As there are millions of combinations of weapon and shield parts, it will take a while to get the 'perfect' item you want. I would suggest that you just make it to level 50 (or 72/ OP 8 if you bought DLCs/handsome collection/ level uprgrade packs) before you attempt to grind for a perfect weapon or shield. Because 5 levels from now, you'll be regretting all of that time you spent trying to get a perfect shield or weapon that is basically useless now. Just a heads up. Another awesome feature is the ability to have different playstyles. There are 4 (or 6 with DLC) main characters you can play as, with each one having special abilities and roles if you are in a team. But you can play each character differently. for example, Zero the Assasin can be a long-range sniper, but can also be played as a close-range melee character. This ability to play characters in many ways is something that you don't always see in games like this.

The game play and all out carnage of this game is what makes it fun. The problem with this game is when action gets really intense the fps drops by a lot. You could get 120 fps plus but when things get hot fps will drop to 40s. For me to get fps under control I had lower display resolution to 720p but with all the effects ambiant occlusion, fxaa, depth of field, all the goodies but especially physic effects which make the action so much more enjoyable. and then the game wouldn't slow to much during action parts. Lowering display rez doesn't usually help my system which is odd and unique to this game. II get 120fps normally and drops to 40 in action parts. The game looks good walking around, not that great,,, but when action starts its Awesome and reminds me of Breath of the Wild level of simutaneously moving objects making the game come Alive. Quite Extraordinary.  \nI'm using a 880m laptop 8gb vram 12 gigs ram 2.8-3.8T ghz cpu 4 core multithreaded, its not running hot, because its got a loud fan and its quiet during gameplay. IDT my systems being used the best by this game. \nOnline works well. I set online to anyone can join and People join and it works fine. I recommend building up your character a bit before going online so you're not dying all the time. Its got a learning curve, at first its tough and you die a lot. I'll finish my review later after I get further or beat it. \nI also set nvidia ms and ss to 2x and ambiant occlusion to quality to enhance the games version of the effects, so I'm using both. 720p needs more aa.

It just has so much content, bosses, loot, etc. I probably have like at least 2,000 hours if I added all my time up from the Xbox 360 era. Only major complaint was it was clear gearbox milked this game so hard. Like jesus-christ, how many DLC's did this game need. Headhunter's were enjoyable to me personally, being short and sweet but dear god they were overpriced. Then on top of that the skin pack's, seriously? Thank god the handsome collection exists on PC. \n\nIt's a looter-shooter done right, for the most part. That's not to say it doesn't have flaws, for example a lot of it's joke's have clearly aged. And it's writing hasn't aged the best either. The story for the most part is quite involving, and very interesting. Although a decent chunk of character's aren't that enjoyable, they just come off as cheap, annoying, etc. A lot of this game's jokes are pretty much dad jokes. Sometime's they are pretty funny, other times they are just repetitive and pretty predictable. Most of the comedy boil's down to absurdism, or dark humor. And it's half good, half bad. \n\nThe game itself is quite enjoyable to play solo even, build's are quite fun endgame. This game's guns are just awesome. Do I need a rocket launcher with a bayonet? No, but it's totally awesome. Shotgun that when I reload it, I throw it out and it track's targets, shooting them continuously until the gun smack's them in the face and explodes. Then the shotgun magically reappears in my hand. I mean come on the guns are just genius. \n\nAlso Krieg is just amazing. I mean literally setting yourself on fire, to do more fire damage, increase your fire rate to literally retarded levels. Then on top of all of that using certain elemental weapons to heal yourself and then literally having a skill that causes your a percentage of your elemental DPS to heal you (boosting this healing even more) and doing so much DPS you easily out heal the damage you are taking by lighting yourself on fire, and the any damage enemies are casting on you. As well as having a skill that can throw out fire balls at enemies, while you are on fire. Then using a flame of the firehawk shield, to constantly let off fire nova's whenever your shield is down (has a really long recharge delay, for a good reason, to constantly spew fire novas), melting anything that dares get close to you. Did I mention there is a skill that actually boosts your fire rate whenever your shield is depleted? And it increase the amount of time for your shield to recharge? Also the fire damage dealt to enemies by your shield heals you too.\n\nI recommend picking up the handsome collection, mainly because it's the cheapest way to get all the content. However it comes with the Pre-Sequel which wasn't that good. Mainly because of the fact the game drag's itself so long by constantly padding the games length. With having you do objectives, and then going \"Haha nevermind it was pointless, actually do this instead\". Or \"Oh no this thing broke, you have to go fix it\". \"Oh no the thing you went to get to fix that other thing broke too\".\n\nI would highly recommend using Borderlands 2 Reborn mod, installing via BLCMM. Their are a bunch of tutorial's to show how to set it up. I recommend this mod because it makes UVHM's health scaling less retarded.", "timestamp_created": 1551661960, "timestamp_updated": 1551663210, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49383849": {"recommendationid": "49383849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198801543962", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 8106, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "last_played": 1551826474}, "language": "english", "review": "Very good. 10/10 would recommend", "timestamp_created": 1551820350, "timestamp_updated": 1551820350, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49383235": {"recommendationid": "49383235", "author": {"steamid": "76561198031753115", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 15183, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "last_played": 1551040493}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh, you didn't get the right prefix on your legendary?

Everyone. The heroes are bandits who don't mind a little worship every now and again, and get off on brutally murdering people who disagree with them. The villain is a psychopath who gets off on brutally murdering people who disagree with him. And the bandits are psychopaths who get off on brutally murdering people who disagree with them.\n\nThe are maybe two exceptions to this rule, one of which who has less personality than a block of wood - and who dies. The other you kill personally.\n\nThe grimderp is so strong that after a while you just stop caring and start begging them to shut up because they're actively making the game worse just by existing. If the game had absolutely no dialogue except for Handsome Jack taunting you, it would almost certainly be a better game. \n\nAnd guess what? Jack improv'd most of his lines.\n\nSuffice to say, the writing is shite.\n\n---\n\nAs for the gameplay, it's...alright. It has some innovative ideas for it's time, crippled by terrible implementation. Take Axton's turret, for example. Fun idea, a deployable turret, how's that going to integrate with his character and skills?\n\nOh. It doesn't at all, by the time you're level 50 its damage is almost insignificant, you can't control it in any way, and its main purpose is applying slag on the enemy.\n\nOh yeah, lets talk about slag. Here's a fun idea, how about a debuff that increases the player's damage! That way they have to switch from weapon to weapon to maximize their damage!\n\nIt would almost be fun, if they hadn't made it virtually triple your damage and therefore be virtually mandatory. Talk about shitty balance decisions.\n\nOh yeah, also, the scaling in this game is just...*bad*. There are skills that reflect back damage, for example, that become completely useless due to enemy health and your health going so badly out of whack. Why enemies could possibly need trillions of health while you have millions is beyond me, but it makes some skills utterly useless. At the same time, the ridiculous damage scaling compared to your health means that any skills that boost your own health become next to useless outside of extreme niche cases.\n\nWhen the number one strategy for taking on raid bosses is 'use a weapon that heals you over 50%, so you can exploit the gameplay mechanic that gives you 2 seconds of invincibility when you're taken back beneath 50%', you know your game is hopelessly broken.\n\nMeanwhile, other skills become absurdly broken. Some characters have skills that allow them to oneshot the hardest bosses in the game, and these bugs were never fixed. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on bad item balance. Weapons that can wipe out entire floors with one shot, next to much rarer weapons that are next to useless. Unforgiven, for example; a Pearlescent that's worse than a blue, despite being something like 100,000 times rarer!\n\n----\n\nLook, for its time it was...okay. Not great.

This is also for them who had stopped playing it after some trivial hours of trying.\n\nA great game but yet I think the enjoyment will depend on how you are playing it! All that I mean, if you want to get the fullest essence of this game then play with suitable co-op partner(s). Some who enjoys solo, they may say different but as I played solo because I had none to play with, so I felt even boring in some point and so also I felt how much the experience would be better with suitable co-op partner(s).\n\nThis is a hard-core game for hard-core gamers. Death and incapability may happen every now and then\u2026 but again the number may be reduced dramatically if you have your co-op partner(s). There are some other advantages too to play co-op (such as, better loot, or think that while you are reloading your gun, your co op partner still firing and thus you will be less hurt by enemies) and the game itself prompts for co-op although everything can be done in solo except few achievements.\n\nThis is a long game, including DLCs and need patience to finish them all. However, as I said before, this is a hard core game with almost a lot enemy everywhere, so, at some point you can feel frustrated if you don\u2019t have proper levelled equipment and so you should farm for right things enough. Here again comes the advantage of co-op; such as you 4 people if farm for 4 weapons and then you can make duplicate of those [though it is a glitch] and you 4 can be well equipped\u2026 which chance does not exist in solo and so can be a lot time consuming and monotonous to be advanced.\n\nFor new players, as I was when I started this game\u2026 may be a problem to understand the architecture of the game. At the very beginning the game starts in NORMAL mode. Once you will finish the main game\u2026 then TVHM [True Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked which you can take as medium difficulty. Re-playing the game in TVHM mode from the beginning once you reach at level 50 and then so also if you have finished the last mission of main story, then UVHM [Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode] will be unlocked for you. So take this as hard mode. There are over power [OP (1 to 8)] mode also where you can think it as very hard difficulty mode where enemy is up of your level. but that can be unlocked once you reach the ultimate level of the game, i.e. level 72. So, the main game will take you upto the level 50; The UVH pack 1 will take you upto 61 and UVH pack 2 will take you to level 72.\n\nAddition as on 30th June: Since I have just finished the main mission of main game in UVHM mode so I shall suggest you if you are playing UVHM then you must carry 2 blue pistols: Potent Rubi and Potent Gorg Nozzle and always keep one of these at your one slot. Whenever you are low in health start shooting using it.\n\nThis is the review basing on my present experience of nearly 400 hours; I can update this review in the future as I shall get new experience.", "timestamp_created": 1497160369, "timestamp_updated": 1498801528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2385, "votes_funny": 45, "weighted_vote_score": "0.977035045623779297", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14757534": {"recommendationid": "14757534", "author": {"steamid": "76561197997240220", "num_games_owned": 3959, "num_reviews": 61, "playtime_forever": 318544, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 444, "last_played": 1551523129}, "language": "english", "review": "Definitely one of the best \"new\" games I have played.

But after the resurgence of Open world games, the downfall of AAA and the battle between TF2 and Overwatch, I think I can finally pinpoint what makes it so beautiful.\n\n[b]The art style is an obvious starting point[/b]. Everything is cartoony and exaggerated, it's filled with colour and despite being cartoony it feels more realistic than the grim grisley greyness of Skyrim, Morrowind, Witcher etc. It's not perfect of course, with clipping and terrible lip sync but with the cartoony atmosphere it adds to the exaggerated charm that it provides.\n\n[b]The characters themselves are also important[/b]. If you compare how they were designed to Mass Effect: Andromeda, the way it has been presented is genius. There are a lot of gay characters, black characters, female characters- but these characteristics do not define who they are. The characters still have peronalities, they just happen to be these things- they are not just addons, it just adds to the depth of the world.\n\nI suppose the most important thing in a game is [b]the gameplay[/b], and this Borderlands nails too. A lot of games can't tell whether they want to be simple or complicated, they can't tell what gimmicks they want to use, so they use everything and it turns into an incoherent mess [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/darkregin2/recommended/391540/]like Undertale[/url]. Borderlands knows exactly what it wants to do. It's a Single Player or Co-Op FPS with RPG mechanics with levelling and loot systems. The RPG mechanics make it feel more open worldy than most open world games. It defines what towns exist, and gives you fast ways to get to them, and while games like Skyrim use the open world idea to make you travel for hours, Borderlands 2 just adds a lot of depth with; secret loot boxes, experience, Cult of the Vault logos or mini easter eggs.\n\nSomething that I noticed in my most recent playthrough is how much freedom you have throughout and [b]how this can appeal to both new players and veterans[/b]. One example is the first area, the entirety of Southern Shelf. You fight Knuckle dragger, to a new player they find out how brilliantly designed the bosses will be: They aren't walls of health, they aren't stupidly damaging, they are balanced with weaknesses and phases. An expert player on the other hand could then debate whether they would want to farm Knuckle Dragger for the legendary pistol Hornet, or just move on. This can also be seen in Southern Shelf Bay when you have to kill Midgemong. A new player could rush right towards Midgemong or maybe explore the boats, while an expert player would take the long route around for some extra loot and instead of calling the bridge over to get across the lake, they can just run across the chain, significantly increasing the pacing and replayability of the game.\n\nOf course Borderlands 2 isn't perfect, the majority of the fun is in the UVHM playthrough which is a DLC. The bugs might throw people off while I enjoy discovering two or three new ones every new playthrough. Even despite this, just the first playthrough with a friend is highly worth your time. Let's hope Borderlands 3 will be another great one. Iron out the issues of Borderlands 2, while still being able to provide replayability where Borderlands: The Pre-sequel couldn't.", "timestamp_created": 1498581213, "timestamp_updated": 1501781063, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 596, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.939152896404266357", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7771572": {"recommendationid": "7771572", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998567007", "num_games_owned": 1397, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 46076, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527395915}, "language": "english", "review": "Borderlands 2 is a game for those that enjoy the feeling of finding awesome equipment hidden in a massive pile of other stuff.\n\nSure, you don't NEED to go in-depth with this game.  On the first playthrough you can get by with just picking up gear as you travel along, choosing stuff that looks better than your current gear, and maybe occasionally buying something in the vendor that looks handy.  The deeper you go down the rabbit hole however, the more there is to discover.\n\nThe story is decent for a First Person Shooter (albeit one with RPG elements), and dialogue is often amusing to a degree.  Handsome Jack, the main antagonist is a cartoon villain with M rated attitudes.  He believes, or at least pretends to believe that he is the good guy, and you are just a \"Filthy Bandit.\".\n\nGraphically, the game has a lot more variations in design and color scheme than it's predecessor (which was brown, brown, and a bit of color here and there).  Cell shaded graphics with thick, graphic novel like outlines is the style of the game, and does a good job of separating it from the average FPS.\n\nNow, on to the gameplay itself!:\n\nAction is often fast paced and exciting.  So long as you don't allow yourself to get too far ahead of the enemy levels, you'll find battles where you have to fight hard to win.  The game does a decent job of easing you into the various elements, such as different gun types (Pistol, SMG, Assault/Combat Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, Rocket Launcher, and Sniper Rifle), the importance of a good shield, grenade mods (alter the way your grenade behaves, including damage bonuses and special effects), Class Mods (Class-specific devices which can boost skills, and have other effects like increasing fire rate with specific weapon types), and lastly Relics (Device which generally boost damage or defence in some way).  Equipment rarity is also made fairly clear.  It goes White, Green, Blue, Purple, Magenta, Orange, Seraph, and Pearlescent.  The final two rarities (Pearlescent and Seraph) are special.  Seraphs require you to have at least one of the season pass DLC to obtain (and you need all 4 of the Season Pass DLC to obtain all the Seraph rarity items), and as to Pearlescent rarity weapons, you need to be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (Playthrough 3) for them to have a chance of being spawned.  Don't assume that a blue is automatically better than a green rarity item, even at the same level.  Experiment!\n\nPlayable Characters and Skills:\n\nThere are 4 included playable characters, and two DLC characters.  Each class has it's ups and downs, and a special game changing skill unique to them.  For example, Salvador (Gunzerker) will dual-wield guns when his action skill is active, meaning TWICE THE FIREPOWER.  Axton (Commando) drops a turret, which damages enemies and draws aggression away from you.  Maya (Siren) locks an enemy's movements for a short time, allowing you to get in free hits.  Zer0 turns invisible for a few seconds and launches a decoy, and his first attack made whilst in this mode does increased damage.  The DLC characters are Gaige (Mechromancer) who launches a flying robot that attacks nearby enemies, and Kreig (Psycho); a schizophrenic musclebound maniac that will whale on everything within reach with increased offensive and defensive capabilities and can even throw his axe at more distant targets.\n\nAside from the action skills unique to the character, there are various other skills that you can put points into, and have an effect on gameplay in some way.  For example, increasing fire rate or damage for a few seconds after a kill is made.  Each character has 3 skill trees, each ending with a final gamechanging skill modifier.  For example, Zer0's Bloodlust (Melee) tree ends with the Many Must Fall perk, which will instantly re-deploy the hologram if he kills the enemy with one melee strike.  As mentioned before, Class Mods unique to a character class will boost certain skills.  It's possible for them to go as high as +6, meaning some skills can be boosted to 11, as the normal limit on points you can put into most skills is 5, though some skills are only 1 (those usually affect the way you play).\n\nPlus, there is a gun that shoots swords....EXPLODING swords...In DLC4 (Tiny Tina's Assault on the Dragon Keep).  So yeah, there is that too.\n\nI hope you found my review useful, even if it might be a bit messy XD", "timestamp_created": 1385491289, "timestamp_updated": 1385491289, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1802, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.949552655220031738", "comment_count": 51, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14105218": {"recommendationid": "14105218", "author": {"steamid": "76561198035346694", "num_games_owned": 1167, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 28293, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541464695}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Borderlands 2 - Excellent Story, Solid Gameplay, Great Characters and one of the very best Coop experiences around.[/h1]\n\n[table]\n  [tr]\n    [th][h1]|| 9.5 ||[/h1][/th]\n    [th]Score[/th]\n    [th]Comment[/th]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Graphics[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]Borderlands 2 has a visual style all its own, it may not initially impress some used to a \"next generation, high definition, ultra realistic landscape\", but it is nevertheless very appealing and detailed. Some of the landscapes and views around Pandora (the world on which the story takes place) are beautiful and each area has its own look and atmosphere.

You are given massive area's to explore all over the world of pandora filled with creatures, quests, secrets and homages to lots of popular culture. Controls are responsive, intuitive and the game mechanics (even at higher difficulties) feel fair and well thought through.

The action is character driven, and while the main story is fairly linear, the open world nature of the game allows you to take a break from the main story arc and explorer the hundreds of characters and side missions that can be found all over Pandora.

Firstly the story can be completed at least 3 times with the same character at increasing difficulty and xp levels (normal, true vault hunter and ultimate vault hunter) with progressively better rewards. There is so much detail in the story and so many optional missions that each play through feels different. Next you have at least 4 (more with DLC) characters each with their own skills, playstyle and story to explore. Finally you have tons of loot in the form of Guns, Shields, Grenades, Relics and Class Mods you can collect for your character. These increase in rarity from white (basic) to orange (legendary) generally the rarer the weapon the more damage it will do and many will have additional unique abilities (red text).

Your character's skills really augment and compliment each other when playing as a team. Enemy and mission difficulty automatically adjusts to the amount of players, requiring real teamwork and synergy to avoid dying at higher levels. The multiplayer allows you to connect (drop in and out midgame) to your steam friends games or to public games, connections for the most part feel quick and responsive even with 4 players and with only a small delay on audio communication. [/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9.5[/td]\n    [td]I can't recommend this game enough, while a minority of missions feel like you are just a glorified delivery boy, most are creative, funny and packed full of classic moments and great characters. So much fun to pick up and play with friends. - I haven't really mentioned the DLC (of which there is a lot) in this review but the main ones (Mr Torgue's, Captain Scarlett and especially Tiny Tina's) are all well worth getting (these are included in the Game of the Year edition), great fun to play and add loads more content to the game. To progress to the highest level in the game (level 72 +overpower levels) you will also need the ultimate vault hunter pack 2 so I would recommend that if you reach the end and still want more.

I have owned this on console and played through TVHM at least 4 times with 4 different characters there. Played all the DLC except Tiny Tina on console, but when the GOTY edition became so cheap on PC I jumped at it and bought all the Headhunter DLCs, and the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack as well. So I can now play through the game THREE times on a character. Dar\n\nI'm so addicted to this game still, but the funny thing is that I don't even finish it, or even come close to it now. I'm in a mass addiction to boosting my Badass Ranks so I just keep trying to \"prestige\" it instead of moving on and going towards UVHM. xD\n\nI feel like I can pick this game up and play it at any time. Do a few things, and then quit playing. Unfortunately, for me anyways, I don't do that. I keep playing for hours, and I let all the other hundreds of games in my library continue to pile up. \n\nI play this game EXCLUSIVELY in SINGLE PLAYER. People will tell you that it is much more fun playing with friends, and truly it can be, but don't disregard this game as a single player game. It is insanely addictive, and it actually poses some slight challenges to you to play it solo. Beating Raid Bosses solo is actually a genuine accomplishment, if you can actually do it. They are meant to be beaten witha 4 player team, but you CAN beat many of them solo. The new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode (UVHM) makes it an even more insane challenge to play solo just for the regular game enemies. Needing to pump them full of slag just so you can actually get ready to start damaging them with any real power. Of course all this is basically a math problem of damage output vs. damage defense. \n\nBorderlands 2, simply put, is one of the best games ever made in my opinion. The sheer addictiveness and fun in playing it are jsut off the charts. I recommend this to anyone, even if you think you won't like it. I thought Borderlands 1 looked stupid for years until I bought it for $5 with everything and realized how amzing the concept is and how it was made for OCD gamers. Now they are both 2 of my most played games ever, and I don't see myself stopping BL2 anytime soon. After all I ahven't even used The Psycho yet!\n\nBuy the GOTY Edition. It is the best deal by far and has most of the relevant content you will want. Forget about the Season Pass and regular game. GOTY has all that stuff and more. Then buy the Ultimate Vault Hunter Pack to get extra level sand a 3rd round. The headhunter DLCs are worth it too for the cheap prices. Only thing not to buy are the stupid skin packs.

What this means is that at its core, it is \"Diablo with guns\". It is a game about looting and shooting, and continuing that cycle throughout the game. If that sounds interesting, than you'd probably love Borderlands 2, as it does this so well it still has a large, active playerbase six years after its release.\n\nOn the FPS side of things, the shooting is very good. A variety of accuracies and fire rates among weapons allows each gun to have a clear purpose and role in combat. ARs are a slight exception to this though - useful ARs are generally harder to find than useful SMGs or pistols. ADS is useful for most situations, but not necessary all the time. Bullet trails are noticeable enough that your eye can find the direction of the shooter in an instant, but not so much that they become annoying. Ammo can be a bit scarce sometimes, but not if you're smart about when you use your weapons. Your character is fairly fast and jumps are rather high, which means aggressive close-range builds are quite viable for most characters.\n\nAs an RPG, Borderlands 2 has an additional layer of build depth, with skill trees and varied equipment options in addition to weaponry. Damage and HP scales exponentially by 13% per level, so enemies three levels higher than you will have the same advantage over you regardless of how far into the game you are. While the rate is a bit high in my opinion, it's still quite manageable and doesn't pose too much of a problem. Skills are done by giving each character a single active power and a skill tree consisting of three branches of passive or contextual skills. Each level earns you one point you can put into the skill tree, and skills that are further down are unlocked by having a certain amount of points spent into earlier parts of the branch (this means you can \"skip\" a part of a branch that has useless/inapplicable skills). Skills can be boosted by class mods along with additional, significant benefits. Relics can be equipped to boost specific stats in various ways, similar to (and stacking with) your chosen class mod. Skill points are important choices, but not permanent; you can respec your skills at the town for a moderate sum of cash, depending on level.\n\nThis game is also very replayable, as you can see by the hour count of many of these reviews. After beating the main story, you unlock a second playthrough, called \"True Vault Hunter Mode\" (TVHM), which allows you to play through the story again starting with what you currently have. In this mode enemies have significantly increased health and damage, which means your build is more important, as is matching elemental weaknesses of enemies. Drops are also better. It will carry you through levels 30-50 for additional skill points to further develop your build. If you have the Ultimate Vault Hunter Upgrade DLC 1 or 2 (and I highly recommend both), beating TVHM unlocks \"Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode\", where enemies get even more health and damage, enemies regenerate health, drops are significantly better, and the game will match your level. While I think UVHM is severely flawed (slag and element matching is essential for everything, you'll often need to grind for the best gear, elemental enemies are extremely deadly), for the sake of being able to perfect your build and always having loot at your own level, I think it's well worth it. UVHM is replayable as many times as you want, and is designed to carry you from level 50 to 61 or 72, depending on if you have one or both of the DLC.\n\nThe game's replay value is largely due to the story as well. This game's story is very well-written. The pacing is the best I've seen since Half-Life 2. Not once did I feel like the story needed to \"get on with it already\" or that it was overloaded with too much plot at once. There are also plenty of side missions to take after a hectic part of the main story or when you're feeling underleveled, many of which give interesting background info about the characters and world. The characters are all interesting and have a fair amount of depth to them, especially the four vault hunters from the first game. Handsome Jack is probably my favorite villain of any game I've ever played. As you play through the story you see his snarky, smug exterior break down into a man with very legitimate purpose behind his actions. He's not ambiguous enough that you'd feel bad for killing him, but enough that you'd understand why he considers himself to be the hero. The excellent writing and talented voice acting here makes him not only a deep character, but exceedingly fun to listen to.\n\nThat brings me to the game's humor. This is definitely a comedy game, and significantly more so than the first one. I found this game to be consistently hilarious, even after repeated playthroughs back-to-back. However, comedy is extremely subjective, and a lot of the humor relies on being dark and absurd, which may or may not be to your tastes. I know many people find certain characters (especially Tiny Tina and Claptrap) to be far more annoying than funny. It's not for everyone, but I found it very funny.\n\nLastly that leaves DLC. This game has a lot of it, to an extent that it's a bit problematic sorting through it all. There is the base game, four campaign DLC, two playable character DLC, two UVHM DLC, five \"headhunter\" DLC questlines, the Creature Slaughterdome (repeatable quests with waves of enemies) and numerous cosmetic packs. I highly recommend the GOTY edition, which contains the base game, the four campaign DLC, both playable character DLC, the first UVHM DLC, the Slaughterdome, and the collector's edition cosmetic pack. To reach level 72 you'll need to buy the second UVHM DLC separately. I do not recommend the Season Pass as it doesn't contain all the DLC it should. If you really want to buy them manually, I recommend both playable characters, both UVHM DLC, Torgue's Carnage, Captain Scarlett, and of course the Tiny Tina DLC. I found the Big Game Hunt DLC to be rather disappointing, but the others were quite good. The Torgue and Tiny Tina campaign DLC in particular were well-designed and very enjoyable, and some of the best pieces of DLC I've seen.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game for fans of FPS games and action RPGs.

Borderlands 2 has crushed its prequel with modified gameplay, gorgeous graphics, hectic music and an interesting story. While the sequel improved in every department, its story took me by surprise. The strong, unique, and diverse personalities you\u2019ll meet through the well-paced story improves the entire experience. Most importantly, this gives life and excitement to the planet of Pandora, which was just a boring hunk of rock in the original game. The \u201cBazzilion\u201d guns that Gearbox claimed Borderlands 2 will have was no joke, and it\u2019s more than just a few minor tweaks in damage and accuracy. The guns will sometimes have a huge bayonet, a wacky reload animation, a crazy looking scope, and may not even have any recoil. When the critics can only complain about an imperfect user-interface, we can conclude that the gameplay is as addicting as we all hoped it would be. For fans of the original Borderlands, this is a no-brainer, but for those who are skeptical about the unique gaming experience that Borderlands 2 has to offer, it\u2019s time to come to your senses and get in on the fun that you\u2019ve been missing out on.\n\nThe Good\n+Lots of great loot\n+Humorous writing\n+Awesome world\n+An actual story this time\n+Single-player is finally enjoyable\n+Co-op is still king\n\nThe Bad\n-Underdeveloped visual customization\n-A serious lack of being able to approach enemy strongholds stealthily", "timestamp_created": 1387385054, "timestamp_updated": 1387385054, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 39, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.769233942031860352", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19576086": {"recommendationid": "19576086", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026046589", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 33045, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 307, "last_played": 1550998409}, "language": "english", "review": "After more than 300h playing this is my short review.\n\nPros\n\n- Story rich, the devepment of the story game is brilliant even with the side quests, you will hate and love Handsome Jack.\n- Jack, he is one of the best main antagonist in gaming history.\n- Amazing NPC characters like Tina, Claptrap, Mr.Torgue, Roland, etc.\n- Great playable classes all different to each other and all of them intereting to play in different way.\n- Loot, it's hard to get some legendaries but it's always fun to open a chest and get something amazing.\n- Weapons, super fun to learn what this new gun with red text does (one of them shoots explosive swords!)\n- Eastern eggs, there's one quest that you have to bring a ring from Claptrap Place to one mountain in Eredium Blight and throw it to the lava then 3 birds comes with loot chests lol.\n- Best community ever, always willing to help and play with you.\n\nCons\n\n- Claptrap needs a wife", "timestamp_created": 1449628387, "timestamp_updated": 1449731359, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 144, "votes_funny": 232, "weighted_vote_score": "0.876867115497589111", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27374502": {"recommendationid": "27374502", "author": {"steamid": "76561198160326485", "num_games_owned": 136, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 5446, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1515292423}, "language": "english", "review": "High quality, low prices, and no questions asked! \n\n~Marcus Munitions", "timestamp_created": 1480045386, "timestamp_updated": 1511460137, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 168, "votes_funny": 83, "weighted_vote_score": "0.87223351001739502", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32304130": {"recommendationid": "32304130", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044545351", "num_games_owned": 1242, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 4003, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527358205}, "language": "english", "review": "Trick your friend into dropping their gun so you can take it simulator", "timestamp_created": 1497049924, "timestamp_updated": 1497049924, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 704, "votes_funny": 635, "weighted_vote_score": "0.894705891609191895", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "39651717": {"recommendationid": "39651717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198129297269", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 7026, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546407806}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]This game is amazing![/h1]\nDefinetly [b]Recommended![/b]\nBut first, you need to do some minor things to finish this game:\n[list]\n    [*]Collect 139,377 brown rocks\n    [*]Defeat Ug-Thak, Lord of Skags\n    [*]Pilfer lost staff of Mount Schuler\n    [*]Defeat Destroyer of Worlds\n    [*][b]Dance, dance, baby![/b]\n[/list]", "timestamp_created": 1517051510, "timestamp_updated": 1517052087, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 127, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853142321109771729", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38442921": {"recommendationid": "38442921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198287582674", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10137, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549889769}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1][b]Borderlands 2 Review[/b][/h1]\n\nBorderlands 2 is a very unique game, it's genre would be best described as a First-Person Shooter Role Playing Game (FPS RPG). \nIt has a lovely balance between Story, Quest Hunting, Loot-hoarding and Comedy. Yes, that's right! Comedy in an RPG game.. we must be on heaven. \n\nThe game's story line is a vague follow up of the games predecessor, Borderlands. It is set on the fictional planet of Pandora, a savage world filled with foreign and psychotic creatures who want nothing more than you to fail in whatever it is you are doing, hostile is the lightest term for how the inhabitants of Pandora act. [b]You[/b], a vault hunter, are tasked with discovering a mighty vault filled with treasures beyond your wildest dreams. Be warned though! You are not the only one who seaks what this vault contains; a villainous man by the name of Jack, along with the corrupt company Hyperion, has come to claim the vault for himself. \n\n\nWhen you begin your journey into the Borderlands, right of the bat you have a character selection screen; it is always good to have a variety of play styles and customisation options available to you. The characters available (in the base game) are:\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]Character[/th]\n        [th]Type[/th]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Axton[/td]\n        [td]The Commando:Axton is able to deploy a Turret, a mounted gun that can be upgraded over-time with skillpoints[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Zer0[/td]\n        [td]The Assassin: Zer0 is able to deploy a decoy of himself and enter an invisible state.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Maya[/td]\n        [td]The Siren: Maya's skill gives her the ability to suspend foes into the air, leaving them defenceless and immobile[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td]Salvador[/td]\n        [td]The Gunzerker: Salvador is able to dual wield two guns (of any type) at the same time.[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\nAll of these characters have upgrade paths to follow, all providing buffs to your character of choice; the route you follow is progressive but completely up to you! Do you fancy making your Zer0 a melee god? Turn the game into a punching party? Then feel free! That is completely possible.\n\n\nSomething to note in all of the Borderlands 2 series, is that when the story mode ends and the almost never-ending list of side quests have been completed; there is a loot system. You can go and farm for the rarest and most powerful gear in the game, collect the coolest guns or kill the hardest bosses! The fun doesn't end with the story. To some however, this may not appear as fun. The grinding for loot and farming of bosses may not appeal to you. That is fine, the game as plenty to offer within the standard playthrough of the game and even more so with the several expansions packs available. \n\n\nTo conclude, I am of the opinion that Borderlands 2 is a fantastic game, it has a very expansive system of gameplay that can fulfill the needs of casual gamers and RPG enthusiasts alike! I for one would put the series of Borderlands at the top of my games list; with Borderlands 2 being number 1. \n\n\n[code] Written and published by Astrella[/code]", "timestamp_created": 1513733911, "timestamp_updated": 1513733911, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 72, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.845325171947479248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29874362": {"recommendationid": "29874362", "author": {"steamid": "76561198126596670", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2625, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501718288}, "language": "english", "review": "10/10 \nI wasnt looking at moxxis tits for an hour with my sniper\ni wasnt gambling for eridien 24/7\ni wasnt looking up shift codes for more keys\ni wasnt wasting all my keys at once.\n\nI swear", "timestamp_created": 1486909949, "timestamp_updated": 1486909949, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 87, "votes_funny": 105, "weighted_vote_score": "0.842027604579925537", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46825638": {"recommendationid": "46825638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198024656036", "num_games_owned": 5147, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 15803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1410811496}, "language": "english", "review": "I have this game on far too many platforms, it's a solid FPS co-op story for me.\n\nIt spends a ton of time just being silly and can be loot crazy.

From both a single player, and co-op perspective.  Hands down one of the most fun games that still holds up even today in 2017.

Get a few IRL friends on board, and it will be a blast.\n\u2022 Decent soundtrack.\n\u2022 Very high replay value. (Each character is unique in terms of gameplay, and multiple types of \"new game +\")\n\u2022 Great sense of progression with the loot, and leveling system.\n\u2022 Easter eggs for dayz!!!\n\u2022 Visually pleasing\n\u2022 Challenging difficulty (which may be interpreted as a pro, or con depending on individual perspective)\n\u2022 Butt stallion, and badonkadonks \n\nCons\n\u2022 Early game may seem kinda slow as skills builds don't really begin to shine until mid, and late game.\n\u2022 Difficulty could be a perecieved as a negative thing for some players.\n\u2022 High replay value may make some of the unskippable story narrative moments feel repetitive after a few runs through.\n\u2022 Slightly old game so it won't receive any more DLC, or much more updates.\n\nTips\n\u2022 Look online for Shift codes.

I bought it for PS3 the day it came out, and I love it as much today as I did then. It's a shooting, looting, story-driven adventure full of wacky guns and enemies, with all these things amounting  to a great deal of fun. The graphics are very pretty, some of Borderlands 2's locations are truly stunning, especially when draped in lens flare; take Flamerock Refuge and Wam Bam Island as examples. Each of the Vault Hunters are fun to play, and carry varied playstyles, so there's something for everyone! Said characters are intersting and very likeable too, my favourite being Maya the Siren for her power and elegence, she melts face.. Borderlands 2 consists of a fantastic cast of NPCs aswell, everyone loves Tiny Tina and Mr. Torgue! Guns, guns, guns; something Borderlands 2 is known for. The game features some gazillion amount of firearms, but Legendaries, Uniques, Pearls and Seraphs are what you're after, these guns are one-of-a-kind weapons that stand out for their rarity and killing ability, most of them come with special quirks like the Unkempt Harold, an explosive Torgue pistol that fires either 7 or 14 shots at once, or the Sandhawk, a DAHL SMG that can come in all elements and fires a spread of projectiles that fly like a bird towards your cowering foes! Loot is a massive aspect of the game, and there's plenty of it. Shields, grenades, class mods, weapons and relics, there's enough to keep even the thoroughest of Vault Hunters busy for a long time. Enemies are varied and plentiful, from the iconic Psychos to Threshers, Bullymongs, Loaders, Skags and Goliaths, the DLCs bring in the likes of Orcs, Wizards, Drifters, Sandworms and Dragons! And of course, there's dozens of bosses too; Pyro Pete, Terramorphous, The Dragons of Destruction and Vermivorous, to name a few, all await you and your Vault Hunter friends; just waiting to be slain! Minibosses are plentiful too, Dukino's Mom, No-beard, Saturn and Assassin Rouf, as examples, most boast their own unqiue drops aswell, so it's worth the grind. The story is great, plot twists and turns ensue, and it's not all sunshine and rainbows, characters share, at moments, hilarious dialogue and you feel involved the entire time.  The story is something you'll grind through, A LOT, once you beat the main questline, you can start it again on True Vault Hunter Mode, where tougher enemies and greater loot await, but it's an indentical storyline this time round too, then after that, you can do it again in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode, supposedly \"where the true Borderlands 2 experience begins\" but this playthrough, however, will be nearly exactly the same as all your previous ones. This isn't too much of an issue though, I'd say I've cumulatively finished Borderlands 2 dozens of times, but it never really seems to get old. Once you finish the story for the last time on a character and reach max level 72, that's when the real fun begins. You can farm bosses and quests for the perfect loot, each weapon comes with varying weapon parts, maybe a Torgue grip or a Hyperion sight, or even a Maliwan barrel, hunting and grinding for the best possible variant of a weapon is great fun, and there's a rush of relief and joy when it finally drops! Farming the Legendary Loot Midgets of the Wildlife Preserve is one of my favourite things to do in the game, each of the little guys have a considerable chance to drop and random Legendary or Pearlescent item, and special relics too. If you're new to the game and you're about to start playing; I'd reccomend installing the Unofficial Community Patch (current version 4.0) which fixes countless bugs and issues and does an amazing job at adjusting drop rates for items, skills tweaks and weapon stats, it is a great way to start your experience and breathes new life into the game for veteran players. All of the DLC is fantastic, Pirates Booty, Campaign of Carnaige, Big Game Hunt and Assualt on Dragon Keep all add unique flavours of mayhem to the already amazing base game. You can find the GOTY edition for around \u00a38, or $11, this is an absolute steal for what you get, a definate pick-up. Borderlands 2 is leaps and bounds above the first game, and is superior to the Pre-Sequel too. Overall, Borderlands 2 is arguably one of the most intersting, fun and unique shooters ever, a cell-shaded masterpiece of gunplay and enjoyment.

It has such a massive variation  , almost every gun spawn with random parts from each manufacturer which makes it even more interesting.

Its a shooter with role playing elements. Players loot enemies to collect gear that best compliments their play style.\n\nIf you aren't familiar with BL, the best way to explain this is to take the addicting looting system of Diablo and combine it with the basic elements of an FPS, throwing in some RPG via an inventory and skill tree. That's essentially the mechanics of the game, and it all slams together so well here. You have four basic classes to choose to play from, and each class has three paths to focus on in a skill tree -- this means there's plenty of variation to play. In addition to these basic mechanics, the game is open-world, though it may feel semi-linear as you can only explore on an area-by-area basis (think the opposite of an Elder Scrolls game, where you can walk around the entire map without hitting a loading screen until accessing a dungeon). \n\nI have to say, with combining so many of our favorite gaming formulas, this game has so many highlights. Sometimes I felt like I was playing something akin to Skyrim. Other times, the ambiance of a specific area or the design of a specific feature reminded me of BioShock. And sometimes certain things brought me back to my Fallout 3 days. However, I never forgot I was playing a completely new adventure that easily whisked me away for hours in the unique and captivating world of Pandora. Lastly, I can't forget the guns. No joke, there are millions of guns you can find. It is so satisfying to find a ridiculous weapon and destroy enemies for the next three hours with it, only to find another weapon that is even better.\n\nOne thing many BL veterans mentioned is the lack of a good narrative beyond funny one-liners in the original game. I never played Borderlands 1, but I can tell you that in BL 2 the characters are memorable, the writing is well-thought out and downright hilarious, and the story moves at a great pace with scenes of great emotion and other scenes of great sarcasm. This is all coming from someone who is used to epic stories from Final Fantasy or Mass Effect. Also, be sure to keep your ears peeled while you fight the various enemies. They say and do some hilarious things themselves. But seriously, the writing is just super clever.\n\nIn conclusion, this is one heck of a game. I feel that it combines the best of so many game genres into a single FPS while adding in a memorable story that motivates you to find out what happens next.

It is the second game in the Borderlands series and the sequel to the popular 2009 hit Borderlands 1. \n\nAs with the first game, you are able to complete a campaign with the main story quest and optional side missions as one of the four Vault hunters.  All of the key gameplay features are all present, such as online co-op, randomly generated loot and character building elements such as talent trees are all found in Borderlands 2. There has been a game of the year edition released last year which includes all the DLC apart from one. \n\nThe gameplay at it's core is the same as Borderlands 1. The focus on randomly generated loot plays a huge part. Each of the characters you have the option to play as have their own specialty, and will bring a feel of originality to each playthrough on either of them.  We also see a new elemental effect in BL2, Slag, this is a substance that increases the damage a target takes if they are covered in it. You will also find Eridium bars as you play the game, these can be used to purchase storage upgrades and increase the amount of ammo you can carry. \n\nWe also see an element of customizing how your character looks as well, you can unlock different skins, head designs, colour schemes and vehicle paint jobs.  Another major addition to BL2 is the \"Badd@ss rank\" system; points are awarded for completing certain in-game challenges, that in turn award tokens that will allow you to increase your base stats. These stat increases also take effect on all of your other single player characters too.  Also similar to the the original, we also see the return of a New Game Plus mode, in the form of \"True Vault Hunter Mode\", which increases the difficulty, and gives you a higher chance at even better loot drops. You are also able to level up to 50 in this mode too. \n\nThe graphics in Borderlands 2 are virtually the same as the original, but with just a more enhanced look to them. We see the vibrant colour schemes in each zone come to life. Along with better quality textures too.  The style of graphics in Borderlands has always been a huge drawing point for me as there are hardly any other games which pull this style off as well as this. \n\nYour first playthrough Borderlands 2 will have a number of difficult encounters, but these can easily be overpowered by returning to the same bad guy, mission or zone after leveling up one or two more times, or getting a bigger better gun. If you stay on top of all of the side missions as you progress through the story mission, you will stay at the right level so that you won't just hit a brick wall of impossible monsters/enemies. To make matters easier when it comes to deciding how tough a mission will be, each one also has a recommended level - so you can easily see how hard a single mission will be without actually having to test the waters first. \n\nA full playthrough on single player of Borderlands 2 took me just under thirty hours. That is a pretty decent amount of content on offer, with the side missions and a decent amount of loot farming involved too. I have put almost 140 hours into Borderlands 2, as I have played various different characters through the story a number of times. This is a game where you can easily spend 300 hours and still be having the same amount of fun. \n\nI had zero amount of technical issues throughout BL2; the game is perfectly optimized, will run at 60 fps, and the cloud save feature makes it even better technically. \n\nBorderlands 2 is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Just like the original, Borderlands 2 is a perfect game with no flaws in it at all. I cannot recommend this game enough. Most people will already have it since it goes on sale so much, but PLEASE play it. You will NOT be disappointed. \n\n[b][u] Tom's Score Card[/u][/b]\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n[b][u] 5) This is a must play[/u][/b]\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I thought I knew it but I've been told that in vanilla, BL2 had est. 1 mil guns). With a very well made combat and RPG system, this kinda game is something that everyone will gain a laugh out of, especially with friends. However that does [i]not[/i] excuse it of the flaws it has. \n\nAs you start the game, a Russian-ish man by the name of Marcus Kincaid tells you the introduction of the story, saying what happened in the ending of B1 (The original Vault Hunters finding and opening the vault only to find \"tentacles and disappointment\" which is weird since I find tentacles alone disappointing.) However, Hyperion has decided to step into power, by putting a H-formed Space Station over the sun/moon/whatever that thing is, making many of the areas overshadowed, and it also gives the game a \"Big Brother\" feeling with Hyperion watching Pandora.\n\nYou are one out of 4 (6 with DLC. It's explained that Krieg got involved by riding on the side of the train in the end of \"A Meat Bicycle Made For Two\" but not how Gaige got in the train) Vault Hunters on a train, to find the new vault that Hyperion has discovered. Then they attempt to kill you, but Axton (as the Commando), Maya (as the Siren), Salvador (as the Gunzerker) and Zer0 (as a [strike]number[/strike] Assassin) manages to together, survive and get into the last train cart, only to find a doll of Handsome Jack the antagonist, wired with loadsa bombs, welcoming them to Pandora before their supposed demise.\n\nThis is where the game begins, with one (or depending on the friends you start with) Vault Hunter waking up in a snowstorm only to have a Steward Bot by the name of CL4-TP (Nicknamed \"Claptrap\" by his deceased non-existent friends) dig their grave. He finds you waking up, and enlists you as his \"Minion\" right from the get-go, and instructs you to get to Sanctuary with him.\n\nIt may be a cheesy setup, but it's hella less cheesy than what B1 had.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much \"Grab the best that you can deal with until you find better guns to make bullets go out of them and into the enemies' heads and/or bodies.\" Where you pretty much side quest until you've got guns good enough to face an army without having a Hulk with you (Unless you're playing Psycho where you are the Hulk.) Gearbox are pretty much \"Quantity over Quality\" when it comes to guns. \n\nHappiness is a warm gun when it comes to this game. \n\nThe RPG system isn't like them Call of Duty games (This is a line you expected didn't you) where you can trade items, bid for them or duel for them with other players. One thing that I HATE though is that you only get 45 skill points instead of 50 when max level (Without DLC).\n\nThe classes available are different from one another, and none of them are your average \"rooty-tooty-point-'n'-shooty-man\" due to their different trees and action skills. The Commando is the guy who likes Tower Defense games and has a turret with him to shoot and distract different enemies. When upgraded, it can cast a shield for your allies, be thrown on ceilings and walls, carry more guns and even rockets, plus having two of them! \n\nThe Siren is a very much support class, her Phaselock lifts an enemy into the air and surrounds it in a ball of energy, which when upgraded can draw enemies towards it, deal elemental damage to everyone around, make your guns fire faster, and you can even make so that an enemy killed in Phaselock can heal you and your allies. She's also got a skill which lets you heal your allies by shooting them.\n\n\nThe Gunslinger is all about compensating for his (presumably small) dong. He can wield two guns instead of one, and when upgraded can make so that you can distract enemies towards you, being able to gunzerk while downed, have a chance of not spending ammo when firing a gun, and... Just in general shoot two guns.\n\nThe Assassin can turn invisible, and can regenerate health while cloaked, be able to perform backstabs, mark targets which makes them take more damage, throw Kunais with random elemental effects,  or you can make bandits be like \"He's like the wind...\" by getting increased gun and melee damage when moving (per level). There's also a skill called \"B0re\" which makes so that your shots have a chance of penetrating enemies and deal more damage every time it goes through someone... Gross.\n\n\nThere are 5 elements in the game, Fire (great against those without a shield), Shock (Great against shields), Corrosive (Incredibly effective towards robots), Explosion (Which is pretty much self-explanotary) and Slag (By \"slagging\" an enemy, they take more damage when attacked by non-slag weapons.) Guns can either have one of these elements, or just have regular bullets which are all-rounders really. \n\nThere are Pistols, SMGs, Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Sniper Rifles, Rocket Launchers and grenades. There's also E-Tech weapons. How do they work? Well, to quote Dr. Zed, \"It turns bullets into... Stuff that ain't bullets!\" They're different from bullet/rocket launchers. Normally they have better stats than normal guns but are harder to use. To quote Dr. Zed again, \"E-Tech is friggin' dope.\"\n\nHowever the game expects you to do all the side quests, and such can get ahead of you quite a lot of times for people who just wanna beat the story real quick. It also has lots of difficulty spikes throughout the campaign, especially in the New Game Plus (named True Vault Hunter Mode).\n\nDespite all of this, it's a really good game, awesome with friends too.

Like the first one, it is a chef-d'oeuvre of gaming. It boasts a masterful blend of FPS and RPG elements with an elaborate loot system to make for truly delectable gameplay. Complementing the gameplay is the unique and self-identifying art style and graphics, the blithe and cartoonish atmosphere, and the lighthearted narrative and zany NPC characters. All of these factors working in concert generate one hell of a gaming experience that should be able to bring pleasure to nearly any gamer out there.\n\n[b]Borderlands 2[/b] plays very much like the first game, except there is just a little bit more of everything. Also, there are numerous small tweaks that go a long way to improve the tiny nuisances of the first installment. It is a direct sequel, but the lighthearted nature of the narrative allows for players to safely not worry about having played the first in order to understand the plot.\n\nAt the core of [b]Borderlands 2[/b], we find the same exemplary elements found in the first installment of the franchise. The gameplay is designed to offer both the face-paced action of an FPS with the character progression elements and gameworld massiveness of an RPG. There is an XP system that awards level-ups and ability-boosts. There are scores of quests to complete; some ancillary and others pivotal to the core narrative. There is a crazy world to explore, filled with various interesting NPCs. Enemy spawns and combat occur in real-time, right in the midst of everything else that is going on in the gameworld. There is never a dull moment or a lack of something to be working towards.\n\n[b]Borderlands 2[/b] also has an elaborate and semi-random loot drop system. In the style made popular by games like [i]Diablo[/i], loot spills out of chests, crates, and enemies to pile up on the floor for you to peruse. Much of it will be junk, but you must always keep an eye out for the rare high quality drops. This is the same style used in the first [i]Borderlands[/i], except it has been amplified to offer a much wider variety of goodies. Due to the nature of the stat-progression of the weapons and the sheer variety, you will find yourself experimenting with many more and various weapons than you would in a standard FPS.\n\nWith [b]Borderlands 2[/b] comes the return of the self-identifying art style that was made iconic in the first game; except the graphics are more crisp and detailed in this installment. The graphics fit the theme of the game with perfection, as they expertly relay the feeling of zany, cartoonish raucousness that the game is striving to evoke. This atmosphere sets the tone for the burlesquing narrative which never wastes an opportunity to poke fun at the other, more serious games it relates to.  \n\nAlso returning in [b]Borderlands 2[/b] is the option for a cooperative multiplayer approach to playing the campaign. The multiplayer also borrows from the style made popular by games like [i]Diablo[/i]. You are able to play with other people by either allowing them to join your session or by joining theirs. You bring your own characters and earn your own XP and loot, but the game will be progressed up to the point that the host has reached. Playing with friends, or even with random people, can make the experience exponentially more hilarious and fun.\n\n[i][url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/murphyslawyercuration#curation]Follow my curation page to see more of my recommendations![/url][/i]", "timestamp_created": 1451511867, "timestamp_updated": 1451530569, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 230, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.835253059864044189", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44403733": {"recommendationid": "44403733", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096351228", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 57107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 126, "last_played": 1551670433}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game, an all time favorite.

I put a lot of hours into the original game back on the Xbox 360. (See my Borderlands 1 review for a Story.)\n\nWhen I heard that Borderlands is getting a sequel I was hyped as hell. I still remember the very day of how I heard that the sequel is happening. It was at my School Library. That was when back when I was new to High School. I read it from an article inside the Xbox Magazine. Yea, you have no idea how hyped I was that my favorite game of all time is getting a sequel. It was truly an amazing day.\n\nAnd when I say that this game is longer then I mean it. It took me around 96 hours to finish the game + DLC and get to level 50. Now if you were to play this game 6 times each time with all of the characters that the game has to offer. You are looking at somewhere maybe around 500-600 hours of gameplay.\n\n[h1]The Story:[/h1]\nTaking place 5 years after Borderlands 1. The game opens with a cut scene of some new Vault Hunters arriving at Pandora in search of a new Vault. That is until you meet the main antagonist of the game, Handsome Jack. Yes. That is his actual name. You will see later why lul.\n\nAs you can guess. Handsome Jack tricks you and tries to kill you. Now you must find the new vault and defeat Handsome Jack who rules over the inhabitants of Pandora with an iron fist. Your story/adventure stars off from here.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\u25cf Improved Storyline from the first game\n\u25cf A bazillion of guns to find, loot and earn\n\u25cf Improved gameplay from the first game\n\u25cf New detailed locations\n\u25cf Returning Characters\n\u25cf CO-OP\n\u25cf Improved Gunplay\n\u25cf World/Landscape\n\u25cf Fantastic DLC\n\u25cf Excellent and addicting gameplay\n\u25cf Lots of new unique Characters to play as\n\u25cf Achievements\n\u25cf Steam Trading Cards\n\u25cf Great NPC's\n\u25cf Vastly improved Side missions from the first game\n\u25cf Soundtrack\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\u25cf Nvidia Phys X [b](It is unwanted setting and it is nothing more than a performance killer. You can't turn it off. You may only turn it down to low.)[/b]\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\nBorderlands is my all-time favorite video game of all time. Borderlands 2 improved in terms of the weak points of the original game. It improved the Story which was one of the weak points of the first game. They improved the gameplay, the gunplay and just, in general, made a fantastic sequel to an already great game. I highly recommend Borderlands 2 to anyone who is looking for a great Singleplayer game or a great game to play together with friends.\n\n[h1]Overall rating 10/10[/h1]", "timestamp_created": 1505590282, "timestamp_updated": 1549472091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765859246253967285", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41300697": {"recommendationid": "41300697", "author": {"steamid": "76561198063270723", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 2046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464484602}, "language": "english", "review": "---{Graphics}---\n\u2610 Masterpiece\n\u2611 Beautiful\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Will do\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Awful\n\u2610 Paint.exe\n\n---{Gameplay}--- \n\u2610 Try not to get addicted\n\u2611 Very good\n\u2610 Good\n\u2610 Nothing special\n\u2610 Ehh\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Just don\u2019t\n\n---{Audio}--- \n\u2610 Eargasm\n\u2610 Very good\n\u2611 Good\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Not too bad\n\u2610 Bad\n\u2610 Earrape\n\n---{Audience}--- \n\u2610 Kids\n\u2611 Teens\n\u2611 Adults\n\u2610 Everyone\n\n---{PC Requirements}--- \n\u2610 Check if you can run paint\n\u2610 Potato\n\u2611 Minimum\n\u2610 Decent\n\u2610 Fast\n\u2610 Rich boi\n\u2610 Ask NASA if they have a spare computer\n\n---{Difficulty}--- \n\u2610 Just press a bunch of buttons\n\u2610 Easy\n\u2610 Significant brain usage \n\u2611 Easy to learn / Hard to master\n\u2610 Not so easy\n\u2610 Difficult\n\u2610 Dark Souls\n\n---{Story}--- \n\u2610 Doesn\u2019t have (Not counting historical stuff)\n\u2610 Something isn\u2019t nothing I guess\n\u2610 Not great\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Good\n\u2611 Lovely\n\u2610 Will make you cry or smile a lot\n\n---{Game Time}--- \n\u2610 Long enough for a cup of tea\n\u2610 Short\n\u2610 Average\n\u2610 Long\n\u2610 Depends on you\n\u2611 Endless\n\n---{Bugs}--- \n\u2610 Never had any\n\u2610 Minor bugs\n\u2611 Few bugs \n\u2610 Can get annoying\n\u2610 Ruining the game\n\u2610 The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs\n\n~~~~Multiplayer~~~~ \n\n---{Servers}--- \n\u2611 No issues\n\u2610 Minor lags every few hours\n\u2610 Can get laggy sometimes\n\u2610 Oh the ping..\n\u2610 Unplayable\n\n---{Status}--- \n\u2610 Top\n\u2611 Always some people around\n\u2610 Not so easy to find people for the party\n\u2610 You\u2019ll have to wait for anyone to join\n\u2610 Barely any soul alive\n\u2610 Dead like my insides\n\n---{Matchmaking}--- \n\u2610 Depends on the host\n\u2610 Brilliant\n\u2610 Fair\n\u2611 You might see much more experienced/stronger players\n\u2610 Unbalanced\n\u2610 Completely unfair\n\u2610 Non-existing", "timestamp_created": 1522941321, "timestamp_updated": 1523301767, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 127, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.834264874458312988", "comment_count": 10, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28113738": {"recommendationid": "28113738", "author": {"steamid": "76561198045316090", "num_games_owned": 282, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 43014, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504378631}, "language": "english", "review": "Must play for any fps/adventure/rpg fans.

With a lot of humour, this game pulls off an action shooter with RPG aspects and a storyline you should follow. There are lots of sidequests that will take hours to complete, but the benefits of completing this game are well worth the time. With millions of different guns, a lot of different character skins and a unique experience with all the various classes, this game has hours of fun built straight in.\n\nThe game will be fun no matter which class you play, but that\u2019s not entirely due to the class. I found that most of the classes really lack something to keep you interested in, and throughout the whole game it feels like more attention was given to certain classes over others. Story-wise, the siren is pretty much the only class that gets any attention and backstory, as an individual with a history and as a class with abilities. All of the classes have a slight amount of backstory that becomes obvious throughout the game, but Siren has significantly more, and even then it\u2019s very little.\n\nBeyond that, the entertainment value of playing as certain classes over others was very noticeable to me. I played as all the classes, including the 2 DLC classes, and some of the abilities and skill trees and other class-specific aspects were lacking for a bunch of the classes. Some things that were common for all of the classes were that there are certain skill trees that seem obviously better than other ones and significantly simpler to think about, making them seem more attractive, and all of the classes lack enough in-game backstory to really get a feel for them. With all these classes, it comes down to a matter of opinion, what sort of playstyle you like and other such things, but I\u2019ve found that there are some that are distinctly more enjoyable than others.\n\nI think if there were more random Echo Recorders placed around the maps with a bunch of stories about the characters, with more information on them the game could be a lot more interesting. Throughout my playing of the game, I found a couple about Maya (the siren), one about Zer0 (the assassin/ghost) and nothing about any other character. That\u2019s always been something that annoyed me. The stories of the characters may exist somewhere, but if they do, they are probably too hard to find.\n\nIn terms of story, I loved this game. There was a hint of humour in just about every interaction you had with the other characters, and the story overall was very captivating and kept me playing. I think the end-game was a bit lacking and didn\u2019t completely match up with the story, but it was still interesting and I don\u2019t regret playing this game through at all. The side quests in this game were very extensive, and easily one of my favourite aspects of the game. Some sidequests are very tedious and boring, but others are absolutely a blast, like those given to you by Tiny Tina (pun intended ;) ).\n\nThe replayability of this game isn\u2019t infinite, it does get boring to play through the same parts over and over again in this game, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t play it more than once at all. Replaying the game in True Vault Hunter Mode, a difficulty increase that allows you to replay the game using your already powerful character, can still be quite fun. The difficulty of the game overall becomes harder while maintaining the same story with no new additions aside from more powerful guns.\n\nThe playstyle in this game is very different from that of most other shooters. In Borderlands, you don\u2019t really need to conserve any ammo and you can run around, jump and do a bunch of other crazy things while still attacking enemies. This makes the game more casual and relaxed, which I found to be pretty enjoyable. You very rarely run out of ammo, with all the excessive boxes with tons of different types of ammunition and the cheap price at which you can buy ammo in shops. \n\nThat brings me to my next point, which is the excess of money in this game. There is very rarely an opportunity where spending money makes much sense or is beneficial, with ammo being really cheap and not really affecting your money and most of the items in shops being pretty bad compared to the ones you can get outside from drops. I know a lot of people enjoy using the slot machines at Moxxi\u2019s bar, but I never found it that entertaining when it for the most part doesn\u2019t get me anything decent. Pretty much the only point of collecting money is to get the badass ranks.\n\nThe whole badass system is something I really like in Borderlands. Being able to slightly upgrade your character in about every way imaginable pretty awesome. Slowly, you\u2019ll amass badass ranks by completing these missions, the more difficult missions resulting in more badass ranks, and for every 25 badass ranks you\u2019ll get 1 badass token which can be used to upgrade one of the 5 stats presented. I really like the additional content that this adds to the game.\n\nPersonally, I far prefer playing this game with other people. I don\u2019t like playing very many games alone, and even if I\u2019m playing a singleplayer game, I like to be talking to other people at the same time. I find it a lot more enjoyable, and the same thing applies to this game. I\u2019ve never played this game without other people simply because every moment allows for a lot more laughing and interaction when you\u2019re doing it with other people. If I had played through this game alone, I might have noticed some interesting bits of humour, but I never would have started laughing hysterically at some glitchy motion or funny joke. The enjoyment is multiplied by a lot when playing this game with other people.\n\nSomething I noticed is that everyone plays this game differently. Personally, I like to play it patiently, doing all the sidequests, and being sure I\u2019m making the right decisions with my skill points and gun choices. When I play Borderlands, I also like to play for as long of a period as possible. Of course I know nothing is that big of a deal, but I like being patient with this game and spending time on everything because I like feeling that I\u2019m making the right decisions. Some of the people I have played with like to speed through the game and skip any extra content and make the easiest decisions possible. I think it\u2019s important to play with people that have at least a similar mindset to you so that you aren\u2019t being forced to play in a way that you aren\u2019t entirely comfortable with.\n\nWarning: Slight spoilers in following paragraph. Reader discretion is advised.\nThe final boss of the game really irked me. There was a whole obsession with how it was summoned using a siren and the key, both of which are very eridium oriented. The final boss used a lot of fiery attacks and swam in the pools of lava that surrounded the boss fight. I think it would have made a lot more sense if they were pools of molten eridium or something, with the boss spewing out eridium, or at least something purple, rather than fire. \n\nThis game also has some really amazing individual lines. They are scared all throughout the game, but easily my favourite is the line that Scooter says when you meet him in Sanctuary. I\u2019ve probably ruined the rewatching of that line several times when replaying the game with friends, through my inability to repeat the line properly and because I keep on trying.\n\nOverall, this game can easily be worth $20 depending on how much you play it and how much you enjoy it. I\u2019d recommend getting it on sale simply because I\u2019ve seen it go on sale reasonably often, for at least 66% off, but the game is also getting older and the Pre-Sequel (another game in this series, taking place between the first and second games) did come out recently. Quite simply, I love the amount of humour in this game, it\u2019s a fun game to sink plenty of time into, and probably one of my top 10 all time games because of how much of a blast I had with it.", "timestamp_created": 1415404473, "timestamp_updated": 1415404473, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 176, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837540149688720703", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10882199": {"recommendationid": "10882199", "author": {"steamid": "76561198072740562", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 47617, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545876216}, "language": "english", "review": "There were a lot of things that made Borderlands such a great game when it came out three years ago: the hardscrabble planet, the oddball characters, the hostile creatures, the diverse missions, the abundant loot, the powerful skill trees, and the novelty of all these things combined in a cooperative first-person shooter.

See CONCLUSION[/h1]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nBorderlands 2 is the sequel to the popular first-person co-op action adventure game Borderlands. Developed by Gearbox Software and published by 2K games, it uses the formula which made the first game good and expanded it in astronomical proportions. The game promises larger maps, expanded co-op play, new classes and most importantly, procedurally generated items resulting in an almost infinite weapon & item variation.\n\n[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]\nThe story picks up after the events of the first game. Hyperion Corporation headed by Handsome Jack has arrived on Pandora, stolen the Vault Key and is driving the inhabitants to near extinction. The Vault Hunters from the first game (Roland, Lilith, Mordecai, & Brick) has gathered what was left of the Crimson Lance and reorganized them into the Crimson Raiders to stop Handsome Jack. The player takes control of a new set of Vault Hunters in their quest to help the Crimson Raiders stop Hyperion from opening a second Vault and unleashing a sleeping monster within.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ Cell-shaded textures that works well with the art style of the game\n+ Great voice acting and characters, most notably, Handsome Jack\n+  Expanded world which is almost 3 times larger than the first game\n+ New classes with new skills that are fun to play\n+ Entering and inviting for Co-op play is simple and easy\n+ Improved story from the first game with well paced missions\n+ Re-playability. The fun does not end after the final boss! There are new unlockable modes and expanded  adventure with...\n+ Quality Story DLC that adds several hours of game time per DLC campaign\n+ A lot of guns. \u201c87 Bazillion Guns\u201d as claimed by Gearbox\n+ Improved enemy AI that goes well with...\n+ Enemy Variety. Fight of bandits, robots, worms, armoured spiders, flying monsters and a whole lot more, each requiring the player to adapt by changing play-styles.\n+ Substantial amount of unlockable Character customization\n+ Good use of Physx for the benefit of PC gamers\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- Texture pop-in. Mostly noticeable when entering the game or entering a new area\n- Loot sharing needs to be improved since ninja looting is a concern for most players\n- In-game voices and messages, even story related ones, can overlap each other. New messages will cancel out any playing messages which is very annoying if your trying to immerse yourself in the story.\n- No ECHO (in-game voice message) replay like the first game. Once a voice-over message given by an NPC is overlapped, there is no way to listen to it again, aside from starting a new game plus.\n- Some DLC maps have glitches\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n[b]GREAT GAME[/b] and with a good blend of first-person shooting action, coupled with the progression and quest system of an RPG and all the fun and excitement of co-op play.\n\n[h1]WORTH IT?:[/h1]\nI RECOMMEND this game to anyone looking for a fun coop experience with their buddies or story oriented gamers who likes an immersive experience. \n\nAlthough the game is well worth it's full price, I would still recommend this to be bought on SALE because of how often this title get discounted and by the sheer amount of DLCs available.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[h1]Like my Reviews?

Many character skill builds are beneficial to a team, and there are different gun element effects that can stack together making the game more enjoyable and fun.\n\nThere are 4-6 character classes for the player to choose from, each with unique skill trees for different playstyles. Each gun have their own distinctive characteristics, and on top of that, the randomized loot stats makes each gun more unique and special. The game is highly replayable due to the huge library of DLCs for post-game contents, and the different possibilities of character builds and randomized loots.\n\n[h1]DLC Reviews[/h1]\n\n[b][u]Long story short: I highly recommend everyone to get the GOTY bundle, and ignore the rest of the DLCs. Later on, get the The Handsome Collection when it is on sale.[/u][/b] (You can \"complete your collection\" via Steam and pay a highly discounted price for the rest of the DLCs during a sale).\n\nLong story starts here.\n\nThere are 5 types of DLCs:\n- Story DLC that adds a few new worlds, with many new quests, new enemies, new loots.\n- Headhunter DLC that add a small world, with some new quests and new boss.\n- Character Class DLC that unlocks new character class.\n- Game Mode DLC that increase level cap and adds a new game+ mode.\n- Cosmetic DLC that unlocks a character skin.\n\nI recommend getting all 4 Story DLCs (they are all included in the GOTY bundle):\n- [u]Tiny Tina's Assault on Dragon Keep[/u]\n- [u]Sir Hammerlock\u2019s Big Game Hunt[/u]\n- [u]Mr. Torgue\u2019s Campaign of Carnage[/u]\n- [u]Captain Scarlett and her Pirate's Booty[/u]\n\nHeadhunter DLCs are not bad, they each add a new world with a few new quests and a new boss. Defeating the boss will unlock a new skin for your character. Although they aren't a must have, but they sure are nice to have. These are not included in the GOTY, I recommend waiting for a sale for the Handsome Collection. The \"[u]Headhunter 3: Mercenary Day[/u]\" is useful for legendary gear grinding.\n\nThere are 2 Character Class DLCs: [u]Mechromancer[/u] and [u]Psycho[/u]. The base game already have 4 base classes for you to choose from, so these 2 new classes are pretty optional. They are quite fun to play with, each adds a some depth on your playstyle. They are both included in the GOTY bundle.\n\nThere are 2 Game Mode DLCs (\"creatively\" named \"[u]Ultimate Vault Hunters Upgrade Pack[/u]\" and \"[u]Ultimate Vault Hunters Upgrade Pack 2[/u]\"). These DLCs will raise your maximum level cap and introduce a new 'New Game+' mode. Only the first one is included in the GOTY bundle. I would say the 2nd level cap increase is pretty optional unless you want to extend your playtime of the game by a lot. The base game plus the GOTY bundle already offers a lot of replayability on its own.\n\nAll the Cosmetic DLCs aren't worth it IMO. They unlock some character skins for you. Although some are really cool looking, it doesn't really affect any of the gameplay. In-game unlockable skins already have a few cool looking ones.\n\n[h1]For achievement hunters[/h1]\n\nYou will need to own some of the DLCs in order to complete 100% of the achievements, mainly story-related DLCs. It will be cheaper and easier to just get the GOTY bundle.\n\nMost of the achievements can be achieved thru normal gameplay. Some of them are collectibles and some will need some grinding. None are near impossible to get.\n\nThere are 4 characters in the base game, each have their own skill-related achievements. Some of those will require you to be high enough level. If you do not want to replay the entire game again with the new characters, you may ask a high-level friend to help you power level.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n\nMy score: 9.5/10 (Get it with your friends, and play together!)", "timestamp_created": 1547722111, "timestamp_updated": 1547722111, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.724677622318267822", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8812776": {"recommendationid": "8812776", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062677855", "num_games_owned": 48, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 76934, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521096471}, "language": "english", "review": "One of the greatest games of our generation.

Yet, the more I play BL2 the more I notice that, if you dissect Borderlands 2 and look at this game piece by piece, it's really not that great, mediocre at best.\n\n- The graphics are mediocre which is cleverly covered up by the comic like art style and its   black lining. \n- The individual places are sometimes \"[i]ok[/i]\" or just nearly unnecessary as you just have to pass through and never come back. To be honest, I found myself saying \"[i]I actually dont like this part of the game that much[/i]\" far too often\n- Compared to Borderlands, Borderlands 2's variety of weapons is... lacking. Restrictions of gun combinations appearing ingame give you a lot less options (not that there aren't a lot). \n- Also, it was very much possible to find Purple Weapons in BL that were far better than Legendary Weapons, as they were often just a gimmick. Now, almost every guns best variant is Legendary, which takes away from the regular weapon drops.\n- Lacking animations\n\n\n\nBut as I said, I played a lot of BL2  - and there is a reason for that. You are not supposed to look at BL2 as it's components, but as a whole. Borderlands 2 is one of the most fun experiences I had when playing Video Games so far. \n\n+ Very big [b]variety[/b] of weapons and a sh*t ton of loot in general\n+ [b]Humorous[/b] Jokes throughout the game that still make me chuckle after playing it the 10th time mixed with lovable characters\n+ Wonderful [b]Muliplayer[/b] with friends\n+ [b]Raid Bosses[/b] that are challenging but fun (well mostly) to do\n+ Good amount of [b]DLC content[/b]\n+ [b]Great Story[/b] and Soundtrack\n\nAnd for the final positive point, the option to play the game as you want to play it. I think what brings me back so often, is the possibility to create my own Builds, mess around with my loadouts and just do what I want. Sure there are restrictions or \"best\" loadouts you find online but for me, a big part of Borderlands 2 is experimenting, finding new stuff progressing skillwise.\n\n\n\nAll in all, Borderlands 2 is a great game and one of my favourites for sure! [b]Should YOU buy it[/b]? Yeah sure, go for it! This game has A LOT to offer and if you are a fan of RPGs, Shooters, Comedy or Raids its worth checking out. Despite some of its flaws I mentioned before, I totally love this game to this day and will probably still play it multiple times in the future. \n\nThe GOTY-Edition costs about 16 bucks if I'm correct when on sale, and the rest of the DLCs about 10 bucks when on sale, so why not, you probably wont regret it! :D\n\n[table]\n    [tr]\n        [th]9/10[/th]", "timestamp_created": 1463219125, "timestamp_updated": 1480460306, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 52, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.793574869632720947", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9421434": {"recommendationid": "9421434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096122936", "num_games_owned": 901, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 5598, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412248075}, "language": "english", "review": "I simply can't praise this game enough.
