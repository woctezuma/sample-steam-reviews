Well, bugginess maybe, but nowhere near the current Windows version, and overall about the same as the bugginess has always been.\n\nDo note that on Linux you may have to use a few launch options to get the damn game to work.  Once entered in however the game works fine.  The ones I use, which I cannot fully confirm are absolutely vital for the game to function or not, are as follows; feel free to tweak them if the locations of the .so files don't match your specific distribution, or it turns out one or more of the needed libraries are actually optional:\nLD_PRELOAD='./libcxxrt.so:/usr/$LIB/libstdc++.so.6:/usr/lib32/libopenal.so.1' %command%\n\nBesides technical gaffs lately, Civ V is probably the last really good Civ.  Past that, they decided that AI was pointless to develop and made the AI so dumb that I'm pretty sure a frickin' pigeon could outsmart it, which given some of the leaders in Civ VI seems VERY disrespectful.\n\nWith regards to Civ V's gameplay, one last thing I can say is that unlike every other 4X game I've ever played, Civ V's AI is actually reasonable to beat at lower difficulties.  They actually do diplomacy OK (Civ 4 was better, but Civ 5 at least had functional braincells in its AI's coding, unlike Beyond Earth or 6), and AI players never have that overwhelming feeling of \"will kick your ass the moment you screw up\" that's way too damn common in 4X games.  This does mean the game's very casual unless you pump up the difficulty to the highest setting, but sometimes casual makes for more fun Vs AI gameplay than the game being the Dark Souls of Grand Strategy. *glares at Age of Wonders 3, Galactic Civilizations 2, and many others*", "timestamp_created": 1549592762, "timestamp_updated": 1549592762, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 13, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58429253101348877", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48936921": {"recommendationid": "48936921", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049521447", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 9708, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1539248525}, "language": "english", "review": "Quit trying to sell me civ 6", "timestamp_created": 1549925277, "timestamp_updated": 1549925277, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 7, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.528517484664916992", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49221953": {"recommendationid": "49221953", "author": {"steamid": "76561198292175836", "num_games_owned": 693, "num_reviews": 14, "playtime_forever": 3380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550329931}, "language": "english", "review": "If you're the type of guy that brings every tank at your disposal to a close ally's capital, ensuring him it's for his own safety after he told you he noticed them, and then bombing him to oblivion and seizing the city for yourself, then this is for you.", "timestamp_created": 1551057232, "timestamp_updated": 1551057232, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.554430365562438965", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48998986": {"recommendationid": "48998986", "author": {"steamid": "76561198065654464", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 17149, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2248, "last_played": 1551664691}, "language": "english", "review": "Uninstalled and sad bc of the EULA rules, literally creepy, ton of time invested with friends, so so sad....", "timestamp_created": 1550201219, "timestamp_updated": 1550201219, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.518028318881988525", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48949202": {"recommendationid": "48949202", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067347091", "num_games_owned": 187, "num_reviews": 8, "playtime_forever": 7072, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1536774761}, "language": "english", "review": "Added Spyware.

The game was simple and broken in some respects, but it was still a great game. I decided to give a PC version a try shortly after I bought my computer. I bought the game for very cheap (around $12). I believe this came with both \"God\"s and Kings\" and \"Brave New World\". I can gladly say that this purchase has been one of the best I've ever made. The memories and fun I've had are worth way more than $12. Hell, I would have paid full price if I knew what awaited me. Both DLC's add so much to the game and the replay value is massive. In my opinion it's the best civ out there even years after release. It might ruin some friendships if you play online or cause you to fail some tests after saying \"Just one more turn\". Still, nothing beats dominating someone militarily or economically or culturally or diplomatically or religiously or.....sorry. You get the point. I won't get into every detail of the game. I'm sure there's a YouTube review that can explain it all in 5 minutes better than I ever can. I'm just here to tell you that even as I finish my senior year in college, whenever I load up this game it takes me back to sophomore year of high school when I first saw that intro screen. Not just civ, but the first time I played Dota 2, Planetside, and even Red Orchestra 2. It takes me back to the summer nights of 2013 when these games kept me up all night. No worries, no stress, and no real responsibilities besides destroying mid tower or taking Delhi. I can go on all day about the memories I have of this game and all the others, but I won't bore you. The point I'm trying to make is this: If a game can take you back to a place when you were happiest; whether it be a month ago, or in my case 6 years ago, it's worth every penny. I hope you give it a shot and have the same experience I did. If not, I hope you find another game that gives you the same feeling.

Each AI opponent has their own personality, and are pretty predictable in how they behave. Any one who has started the game next to Neopoleon or Ghengis Kahn knows they immediately have to have a decent military to repel invasion, while Ghandi will to muscle you out with religion and culture.\n\nThere are some important changes between Civilization IV and V. One of the most notable is that wars are plausible again as you dont constantly lose health in enemy territory and cities are easier to conquer. Additionally, culture doesn't automatically take over neighbor's cities anymore. \n\nThis game is easily worth the money.

Civilization VI, has been out for almost a year.\u00a0 Despite that, I find myself repeatedly coming back to Civilization V to get my 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) strategy game fix.\u00a0 Having gotten back on a Civilization kick this past week or so, I plan to review Civilization VI before too long, but before I do, I thought it would be good to go back to the game that got me full-on addicted to the series.\n\nCivilization puts you in the role of the leader of a budding civilization, having you build from a single settler unit and a warrior unit to - hopefully - a massive empire turning the world green with envy with your religion, culture, science, economy, and military might.\u00a0 The base game includes 18 unique civilizations, each with their own unique units, traits, strengths, and weaknesses.\u00a0 There are two major expansions that add an additional 18 civilizations along with a few more minor DLC packs that add another seven civilizations for a grand total of 43.\u00a0 It's not just the in-game differences that make these civilizations unique but the detail that went into them; every civilization leader is fully animated and complete with lines of dialogue spoken in the leader's native tongue.\u00a0 For example, when interacting with the Romans, you'll see Augustus, the first Roman Emperor, fully animated with lines recorded in Latin.\u00a0 When interacting with the Aztecs, you'll see Moctezuma I (no, that's not a typo) speaking Nahuatl.\u00a0 While it's not exactly a work of historical fact, obviously, as a history teacher, the amount of detail that went into the leaders and their presentation makes me absolutely giddy.\n\nCivilization V offer five different paths of victory.\u00a0 Of course, you have the tried and true domination victory in which you must crush your enemies.\u00a0 As of the Brave New World expansion, you must control all players' original capitals including your own to achieve a domination victory, meaning that you could technically win through domination without actually wiping out a single civilization.\u00a0 Leaving them alive, however, will obviously give them incentive to retaliate and rid their capital of your filth.\u00a0 You also have the option of a science victory, requiring you to complete certain research projects, build, and be the first to launch a starship to Alpha Centauri.\u00a0 Cultural victory involves making your culture so vibrant and desirable through various policy upgrades (that, in turn, end up influencing your Tourism) that other civilizations' citizenry all start to prefer your culture over any other.\u00a0 Diplomatic victory involves progressing to the point where the World Congress is created and then develops into the United Nations.\u00a0 From there, you must attain enough votes from your own delegates as well city-states or - if they have no sense of self-preservation - other empires to be elected \"world leader\" by the UN.\u00a0 The last victory type is the time or score victory.\u00a0 Unless this victory type is disabled, whoever has the highest total score by 2050 AD (that's turn 500 on standard speed) is the winner.\u00a0 Score is determined by pretty much everything - gold in your treasury, units you possess, research you've done, territory you control, the number of cities in your empire, the population of your empire....it's an exhaustive list, but the idea is straightforward - the highest score wins.\u00a0 Of these various victory types, cultural is probably the most obscure due to the less-than-straightforward relation between the culture that generates your policy upgrades and the tourism stat that actually triggers the victory.\n\nMy favorite thing about Civilization is that it can be as confrontational as you want it to be.\u00a0 If you want to, you can start wrecking shit right off the bat.\u00a0 If you're more into the empire building aspect than the empire conquering aspect like me, you can build up your empire relatively peacefully, maintaining just a defensive army (or no army) and focusing on science, culture, and city growth.\u00a0 Diplomacy, while having some flaws in Civ V, allows for relatively peaceful interactions as well as confrontation with various trade options and a few different kinds of pacts you can pursue with other nations.\u00a0 Making all of this better is the option of playing online with a mix of people and CPUs.\u00a0 My favorite thing to do is play with a couple of friends and handful of computer players and - hopefully - keep a relatively cooperative, peaceful relationship with my human counterparts.\u00a0 It's a lot like Risk in that there are some backroom deals going on but unlike Risk, avoiding confrontation is a perfectly viable option.\n\nCivilization V was, in my opinion, the absolute pinnacle of strategy game perfection at the time of its release.\u00a0 As my first \"main\" Civilization game (excluding the spin-off Civilization Revolution), it's secured both a very special place in my heart as well as the status of being my primary point of reference when playing any other Civilization or 4X strategy game.\u00a0 While there are a few areas that I think could have been improved, it's still a definite masterpiece of strategy design.\u00a0 The detail of the maps, the variety of strategic and luxury resources to claim and exploit, the diplomatic aspects, the number of different victory types, and the diverse array of civilizations from which to choose all make this game truly mind blowing when you stop and think about it.\u00a0 If you have any interest at all in strategy games, I'd give this one a go.\u00a0 With Civilization VI having been on the market for nearly a year, Civ V isn't too pricey these days, and it's still an amazing experience, and that's even before you take into account the various (and often hilarious) mods on the Steam Workshop that you can download.\u00a0 Of all the games I've recommended, this is one of the most highly recommended, hands down.", "timestamp_created": 1498524644, "timestamp_updated": 1498524644, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 188,

However, I have always believed in \"dibs\", so I placed down Glasgow onto the land between us, to provide a little buffer. They seemed annoyed by this. A few warriors glared at each other across our borders for a few hundred years, but otherwise, nothing too bad happened.\n\nIn order to spread our religion further (because we were known for our Confucian beliefs which helped us grow our borders and spread our religion faster), we begin to invest in boats. Soon we covered the oceans in missionaries, Inquisitors, and warriors to help defend our religious allies.\n\nBabylon was making friends with a local city state, Genoa. However, they were trying to spread Zoroastrianism; those heathens! Despite both our religions being known for their peace, we passive-aggressively sent missionary and Inquisitor to Genoa. Over the course of about 700 years, we had probably burned a few thousand people for swapping religions; those same Warriors had been given spears now, but they continue to glare at each other from across the borders.\n\nI offer Babylon some sugar for their spice; they wanted my sugar, iron, coal and all of my money. I then asked Germany if they wanted sugar for spice; they accepted.\n\nNorth of me, Rome had begun a war with France. Due to my time of peace and massive amounts of trade, I found myself with a huge amount of money. Everytime France and Rome made peace, I knew that Rome was beginning to look on my relatively peaceful country with greedy eyes. So I bought... I gifted many city states my religion and gold, and then I bought... gifted France and Germany enough money to declare with with Rome.\n\nWhile they fought, my Spearmen (now Musketmen) continued to glare with Babylon's, and we continued our 1500 year religious passive-aggression over Genoa. They said I was spying on them; I said I wouldn't. When my spies returned, I sent them back to Babylon. A squad of 5 Great Prophets charged into Babylon, converting left, right and centre. Babylon complained I was being a bit aggressive. I apologised. I then sent more missionaries to Babylon.\n\nI had now found every single Civilization; we decided to have a United Nations meeting in 1600A.D. I, as the host, gave everyone a single vote. Except myself. I gave myself 16, due to my popularity. I declared my religion to be the world religion. Every one opposed. I listened to their opinions, and then passed it anyway. When Rome got angry about this, I then paid France to declare war again. When Babylon got angry, I then paid Rome to declare war on them.\n\nMy civilians were amazingly happy; hugely more than any other place. But because I was an Emperor, they declared me Declis the Terrible; despite my universal healthcare, happy citizens, peaceful religion, not a single war in my entire history and massive popularity in the word. My army consisted of mostly my friends, my city states, and my Musketmen (now Great War Infantry) continued to glare at the Babylonian Great War Infantry, after 2000+ years. A great duty to my nation, their descendants shall continue to frown at the Babylonians until the civilizations of the world fall.\n\nEventually we reached a grand United Nations meeting; I sat on one side of the chamber with my 12 City State friends, and the other 7 nations glared at me from the other side. I said that the People's Confucian Republican Empire of Scotland was the best nation in the world.\n\nThey all voted against me. I smiled, and then declared I won anyway.\n\nDemocracy is overrated. Freedom of religion only applies to my religion. I don't need to be stronger when I'm more popular (and my people are probably more beautiful). And if you don't like me, I'll pay your best friend to backstab you.\n\nThrough this, I came to understand American foreign policy.

The father was a former alcoholic who would (sadly) get a year in jail. Even so, despite his flaws, the son loved his father, and the father was a loving parent when he was around, which was rare as he moved to Boston, Massachusets. But one day, when he was 18-years old, he finally got the opportunity to stay with him in Boston for a week, much to his mother's regret.\n\nSo he brought with him his gaming laptop to play his recently-purchased Civilization V, which everybody was gushing over how amazing it was. The boy was playing as Denmark (he loves axes) and he just wrapped up his invasion against India, when his father told the boy to go to bed at 9:00 - yes, even when an adult, he still doesn't mind going to bed early.\n\nBut at 2:00 AM, the boy couldn't sleep, so he snuck downstairs and smuggled his gaming laptop upstairs to play more Civilization V. Everything was fine, until suddenly, the boy's father snuck upstairs, clearly hearing everything.\n\n\"What are you doing up at [i]this[/i] time? It's the middle of the night.\"\n\nClearly seeing his disappointment, the boy blushed. \"Um... Civilization V?\"\n\nInstead of being utterly disappointed, the boy's father laughed - not out of condenscendation, but out of joy.\n\n\"Wh-What's so funny?\"\n\n\"Nothing,\" The father laughed. \"You're exactly like your old man, you know that?\"\n\nHe took the boy downstairs to his work place, and booted up the computer.\n\nHe smiled mischievously at the boy. The computer had Civilization V on it.\n\n\"Wanna have some good times with your old man?\"\n\nThe boy smiled ear-to-ear. \"Would I.\"\n\nFor one whole week - and fortuitous timing, since the father was on break - the father and the son played hours upon hours of Civilization V all the way until late in the night for a whole week. Even when the mother had to pick up the son eventually, the week-long fun and 81 hours of gameplay time was far more than enough for the memories to last forever. He knew he wouldn't be able to see his father for a while, but he knew that - despite his flaws, despite his former-alcoholism and arrest - the father would still love the son, and the feeling would always be mutual.\n\n[spoiler]Thanks for the memories, Dad.

Instead, I found the game to be extremely helpful and newbie-friendly. Like other strategy games, you learn the basics then gradually build up a better understanding of the game and its mechanics, feeling more and more like a pro with every minute gone by. After about four hours playing I felt pretty confident, but even today I am learning things I never knew or had any comprehension of in the game. The simplicity which has been introduced to help newcomers coupled with the fact that the game maintains the same look and feel with older generations is a really positive thing that was pulled off very well.\n\nThe game offers serious levels of depth due to the vast number of playable races, multiple methods to seek victory and the ability to play on completely randomly generated maps every game, with available templates to choose from if so desired. I have only played a handful of games right to the very end since they can last for many days, especially if each session isn't particularly long. Every game feels very different to the next, providing this title with a lot of replayability.\n\nThe AI is sometimes criticised but I think that it is well done in this game with a large range of difficulty levels to choose from, ranging from literally zero experience to the grandmaster level. They can often be somewhat unpredictable but I personally see that as a good thing, I mean, what's the point in playing such an in-depth strategic game like Civilization V when you can anticipate what the AI will most likely do? Part of the magic of this game is that it immerses you into the position of a leader, facing situations where you have to make decisions on the spot with no idea what your opponent is going to do.\n\nOverall this is a great game worthy of your money, but I would advise waiting for it to come on sale as it frequently does, it isn't the newest game in the world either.", "timestamp_created": 1385411873, "timestamp_updated": 1385411873, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 653, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.913812756538391113", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46090815": {"recommendationid": "46090815", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973371900", "num_games_owned": 177, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 245060, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2454, "last_played": 1551851222}, "language": "english", "review": "After 8 years they updated the game.

On sale, it's a steal; get it!\nWith all the major expansions this is the essential Civilization game, and a great taster if you are thinking of Civ 6.\n\nFor those new to the game, the gist of it is this: You start off with just a city and a warrior unit from which you begin building at the 'dawn of time' and gradually expand your civilzation by gaining culture, advancing scientifically, building and using military, diplomacy, building new cities and buildings within those cities, and building enough 'improvements' to sustain an economy which can maintain the above. Because the map is tiled, each tile yields resources; perhaps a certain amount of food, construction, gold, or even another resource such as horses (needed to build horsemen etc) or iron, oil, even uranium (I don't need to tell you what that's for). As you progress you will find that you unlock more and more improvements, more buildings and more units that you can build, and if you play your diplomacy and development well enough, you will find that you can really start to get ahead of the competition; picture tanks versus musketmen - that can happen. Finally there are wonders which can provide a variety of benefits and a boost of culture. Benefits may include a free worker, reductions in costs for various things or even free technologies! Obviously getting a wonder before other people can therefore be of great importance. \n\nThose are the basics and to new-comers that's more than enough to be getting on with and the AI can give you fairly decent games on a variety of difficulty settings. Equally, there are many, many, many map varieties for your prefered experience - you might want a map with no water, on the other hand maybe small scattered islands: [u][b]You get a huge amount of customisation here, and it's not to be understated![/b][/u] On the subject of customisation; there are many, many different leaders you can play. The game even offers different leaders for a given civilization in some places; each leader provides differences to the civilization and so as you play with any given leader you want to keep their bonuses in mind and exploit them as best you can. It must be said though, personally I don't tend to notice a great difference between given leaders, the most noticeable thing is their unique units, but even those only last so long before technology supasses them. Maybe I'm just not pro enough. Yet, I play casually, and I enjoy it.\n\nThe visuals are readable and clear which really helps for longer play times, and the soundtrack is different for each Civ and varies based on the era you are in or whether you are at war or peace. As the Brits, you may even recongise a good bit of Greensleaves in there too. For new players there is also a decent [i]Civilopedia[/i], essentially a wiki lookup for everything in the game, and even includes larger written backgrounds on each leader and Civ for the historically curious. \n\nPersonally, I never really player online or with other people much so I can't really comment on that, but from the time I did spend with other people, I can say that it's an enjoyable experience, even when they march into your territory and refuse all of your offers of peace because, well, they know they are going to walk all over you... or me in this case; we've already established I'm not particularly good at this game. \n\nAnother caveat though is that the AI can be a bit temperamental, though this has always been an issue with Civ games and remains one because they can never really act like a human (then again I haven't played at higher difficulties); they might denounce you for no reason, expand erratically, and so on. The final thing to say is that late game diplomacy can be a little... 'off'? Things like World Congress and United Nations - too me they became annoying po-ups every few turns that had little to no impact on the game other than that annoyance and were never really very well explained as to how some people end up with more diplomats than others, more voters and so on. But by that time I have a big enough nuclear arsenal that no matter how much the UN may not like it, I can kill everyone everywhere, like Mr Kim over there only dreams he could.\n\nIn summary; it's a good game as a complete edition with all the expansions. On sale the bundle is more than worth it. Civ 5 Complete is a great entry into the 4X genre (4X = eXplore, eXpand, eXploit and eXterminate). \n[u]Without the expansions though, Civ5 does have a few holes.[/u]", "timestamp_created": 1498161251, "timestamp_updated": 1498161251, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 66, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.848374903202056885", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "7774585": {"recommendationid": "7774585", "author": {"steamid": "76561197984391739", "num_games_owned": 1072, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 45823, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1385097800}, "language": "english", "review": "Civilization V is the thinking man's game. It doesn't require lightning reflexes, speed or precision, however it is probably one of the most complex games ever created.\n\nYou're able to pick one of many civilizations to guide from 4000BC to the Present, allowing you to shape their culture, military and economic structure among others. You control everything, from where to build a city, how you allocate resources, scientific research, religion, espionage, tourism, corporations, and more.\n\nThe game has an extremely intricate diplomacy system as well which allows for you to befriend or antagonize the other civilizations. There are multiple ways to win a game, allowing for multiple play-styles.\n\nAs someone who has been playing the Civilization games for over 20 years, I strongly recommend Civilization V with all of its DLC.\n\nCivilization V has also made our list for the top 35 games of the generation.

Zooming in and out on units, cities and terrain allows you see all the little  details while also giving you the ability to see the \"big picture\" strategic view. Graphics are vastly improved from previous games in the series. If I had one wish I guess it would be to have your cities and their buildings represented better visually. Cities grow and spread with population and advance with technology/era and have several different styles depending on the nation you select, and the building of wonders will add the wonder to the area surrounding your city but it would be great to have further customisation of your cities so you could really make them your own.

The ambient sound is excellent, move your screen to a coastal area and you will hear the wash of the sea, select your boats and you will here the crack of oars or ring of their bell.

This is by no means a simple game, it takes time to truly learn and fully appreciate but once you get into a game your hooked. Civilisation is by far the most addictive game (maybe with the exception of certain MMORGP's) out there. The \"just one more turn\" is a running joke because you will often find yourself planning on playing just one more turn to build something or win a battle and then you will look to the clock and find several hours have past. The start of the game is exciting, turns move quickly and you see your planning quickly realised, mid game you must continue your expansion and put in place what you will need to win. The only place where I feel this game falls down is late in the game, by this point sometimes there will be a clear winner, technology advancement will slow and your empire will often be so massive and units so numerous that just taking your turn can take quite a lot of time. Overall though gameplay is outstanding. The AI can be a little quirky at times but for the most part is challenging and tactically sound. Relationships between civilisations are all based on their predisposition and events which occur throughout the game and can therefore be somewhat predictable.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td]Story[/td]\n    [td]8[/td]\n    [td]The Story of history rewritten, the story of civilisation, so many details make up this game and so much background history on every aspect (via the civilopedia). The DLC add's on (amongst other things) quests which add to the story but in truth these add little to the game.

The most enjoyable aspect of multiplayer I found was the hotseat mode. In this mode you play locally and multiple players take the game in turns (like a boardgame), once again the time required to get near the end means you could be in for a very long (but very enjoyable) game.[/td]\n  [/tr]\n  [tr]\n    [td][h1]Overall[/h1][/td]\n    [td]9[/td]\n    [td]While some purists will prefer the earlier Civ games in the series, I feel that Civ 5 (and especially with the main DLCs) is a worthy successor.
