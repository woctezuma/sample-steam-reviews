The Official Servers are absolute Cancer with \"Alpha Tribes\" transferring managarmas onto every server they can get their grubby hands on. Not to mention there is no balance once so ever in this game. On an official server with no boosts it will take you hours to even level up enough to tame your first dinosaur. The dinosaur itself will take at least an hour to tame whilst it is very common for people to run around it spears and just kill your tames and run away. The only reason people have thousands of hours in this game is because it is so grind based that, you have to grind in order to get dinos... in order to grind. I'm not talking about the fun kind of grinding like going into caves or underwater oil nodes. I mean having to gather about 3500 stone to rebuild your base because it got wiped while you were asleep. This game seems to punish you for doing better instead of rewarding you there's such a reward spike at a certain point that if you even start to build a metal base or get a T-Rex it will make you 20x more likely to get wiped. Not to mention you have the most toxic player base imaginable. I'm talking about people who will sit on top of mountains and kill all of the dinos you spent the entire day taming because you killed them when they attacked you. \nThe map is absolutely huge.

There were restarts and crashes everywhere, but the world was new and shiny and every interaction with a player was exciting because no one knew anything and we were all in it together. Even the naked pvp bros who had nothing but inventories full of spears and meat were an interesting encounter. I put all my stats into crafting and swim speed (aka oxygen), the land peons knew not of the Megalodon infested depths.\n\nThese simple days are what Ark is in my mind. And if you're new, I'm sure you'll enjoy your first time too.\n\nHour ~100:\nLife is good. The combat is tight. The graphics are lovely. The design is breathtaking. The music is hype. The crafting, building, taming and leveling are all well balanced and fun. The crashes and restarts are just part of the deal, we get over it. I am again part of one of the first tribes, if not THE first tribe to kill the first boss. We way over geared for it and came away with no casualties. A grand ol' adventure with randoms I no longer remember the names or faces of. A small achievement lost to time.\n\nHours ~400-700:\nBy this point the cracks in the looking glass have began to show. As the management, not knowing what makes a good e-sport, decides that it is time to do the E-SPORTS and to focus on DLC! Bugs go unfixed, questions go unanswered, dossiers lag behind and the old player base collectively feel a lever being flicked. A lever most did not want touched as the game takes a slow left turn onto a different track...\n\nMaybe it was planned from the beginning, maybe some hierarchical change beset itself upon the company. What ever the case, the experience changed as power creep set in, modding sprung to life and the e-sports floundered. I stopped playing a little while after the addition of the Dragons.\n\nHour 1,005: \nI stand in an empty clan base, appreciating the custom architecture standing in memoriam of those who stopped adding to it long ago, walls decorated with art from amaturish and lewd to quite moving, shifting through chests and walking around stables filled with tributes from bygone tribes who wanted us to take care of their belongings and pets after they were gone. \n\nHour 1,006:\nOn an empty server about to be shut down permanently, which was only threatened by the occasional spear throwing noob, I set all the tames free, sail to the edge of the map and log out. The last of about 5 similar sailing journeys I underwent, with a similar fate. This time I would not start a new adventure with new strangers in a new land.\n\nNow a days when I see videos of titanic base raids or role-playing friends or alpha clan political drama, I can't help but feel that the game had a bit of an identity crisis, certainly losing the wonder I first felt back in the opening weeks. But gaining some other flavor of wonder in it's place.\n\nThe game settled on a fantasy sandbox clan-warfare persistent.. thing. It does this well and seems fun. Just not for me anymore.\n\n[h1] TL,DR; [/h1] \nYou can find pve, pvp or roleplay servers and Ark:SE makes them all fun in the end. It left what I wanted and evolved into something new but still good.\n\nSuggestion: Play it, find your niche in a community or invite friends and have a blast. $60.00 for 1k hours of adventure was WELL worth it for me.

Also the bugs on this game are very common but are in good progress of being fixed. Also playing this game can be very angering to many: like whilst taming a therizino, a raptor pack has to ambush you and screw it all over. Or maybe an OP creature spawns by your base and possibly kills multiple takes, very annoying over parts. And the game is way easier when you have friends, being alone will be difficult even getting irritating at some point to look up YouTube tutorials on how to do anything in ark.\n\nOverall, I\u2019d give ARK an 8.5/10 - still room for improvement.

It has an extraordinary amount of features that make it one of the best games (in my opinion) I have ever played. I currently have it from Microsoft Store, but it can be bought from Steam, Microsoft/Xbox, Sony/Playstation, Nintendo Switch and on mobile. This means that the player base of ARK is huge, and when playing on Official servers means that you may meet an amazing variety of people. Also, if multiplayer is not in your interests, Ark can be played single player although in my opinion playing with friends is much more rewarding and enjoyable. \n\nI enjoy playing Ark mainly because of its sheer variety. Perhaps you want to explore the huge maps? Perhaps you want to work with others to accomplish goals, like the taming of a particular creature? Or maybe you just simply want to build the perfect base. Ark caters for all of these ambitions and many more besides. It can be played single player, played with a small group of friends on a Non-Dedicated Server or play with many others in Ark's servers. There are PvP Servers that allow players to raid each other and steal materials or weapons. There are also PvE servers for those who simply enjoy the challenge of surviving on the Ark. \n\nAt the moment there are 3 DLCs available. Experience the heat of the desert in Ark:Scorched Earth.

It should be expected to lose everything from one wrong decision, or merely being seen by other players who do not care who they crush.

This is a game where sadism and masochism are the only traits I can think of that can help a player enjoy this game. \n\nI have seen dozens of large tribes rise and fall ranging from weeks, months, and years in their lifespan. All tribes suffer from the same issues. Cohesion, communication, and trust are the pillers that hold each tribe up, and each will inevitably crumble under the weight of the tribe's size and the stresses the tribe must endure. Holdfast to the values that hold your tribe and learn to let your sorrows go if you wish to remain together. \n\nI loved this game and I do not want to dissuade anyone from coming to it.

Flat out, fun. I have always enjoyed survival games, and this adds taming dinos to the mix. I've always enjoyed dinosaurs, so this game was especially fun for me. My friends and I play these games together and have went through every expansion. The game has progressed and story has gotten deeper (I think?) but we still aren't sure why we're on the Ark.\n\nThe building has progressed and PVP feels decent, but after playing on modded servers with 2-5x taming and harvesting playing on anything else just feels slow. We've started over many times, on many servers, and every time it's fun and fresh and there's something new for us to do. The game still sometimes feels slightly unpolished, but all in all I am definitely a fan and would recommend this game.\n\nThat being said, I would not spend full price on it. We got into Ark way back when it was first coming out, for probably around $20-30 for the base game, and then got the expansion season pass for very cheap one time during a sale. When they \"launched\" the game out of alpha/beta and made it official, they raised the price to match. Now it's just too much for the base game in my opinion. If you can get it on sale, it's fun. But do not pay $50 unless you HAVE to have it right now.

Ark survival could have been a master piece and in some ways it is. The creature and map design is amazing although it is hard to appreciate with how plauged this game is with bugs and issues. It seems that everytime I die or get one of my tames killed its to one of the hundreds of bugs which ruin this game. Itd be hard to make a list of all the bugs and issues but to list a few. One of the most gamebreaking is the terrible hitboxes/hit registry, sometimes (quite often) you will shoot dinos with a crossbow or gun and see the projectile hit the target, see blood, yet you will get no hitmarker. This is also prevaliant with taming the giant crabs on the dlc map Abberation, which are essential to the map. To knock on out you must hit it with a catapult in the body. Although despite clearly hitting it in the body half the time no torpor will be applied to the crab and you will only do damage eventually leading to the crabs death. Just today I lost an animal to a pteranadon simply because my crossbow shots wouldnt register on it. Another gamebreaking issue is the terrible ai following, quite often when attempting to lure dinos to tame into traps or just another area they will bug out and simply lose intrest in killing at all and even move specifically away from the player, this is common with the giant crabs but also happens with many other creatures, basilisks, managmars, argents, the list goes on. Another massive issue is the undermapping, although ive never experienced this myself there are always reports of peoples tames or themselves being killed because someone found a way under the map and killed them. A problem that I constantly find myself having to deal with is areas of the map that you get stuck in such as different inclines and different gaps in prebuilt structures that are impossible to get out of without having someone else bail you out. This is an obvious issue since you lose all your shit and cant get it back if you dont get out. Although in most games you can just brush off the bugs and keep playing this games constant fuckery of bugs and glitches makes it feel like a waste of time even playing it, just recently i spent about 4 hours of my night taming a creature called a managmar only to have it float in the air once it was tamed, not obey following commands, and float out the map and die. Overall Ark could have been an amazing game as its creature and map design is extremley impresssive and is majorly let down by the shit programming which really just ruins this game. I would only recommend this game if you are extremley tollerant of bugs and glitches or you plan to play singleplayer or a custom server where you can use admin commands to overcome the games bullshit.\n\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1551442361, "timestamp_updated": 1551442361, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.519841313362121582", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49276122": {"recommendationid": "49276122", "author": {"steamid": "76561198336087548", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7406, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3723, "last_played": 1551811920}, "language": "english", "review": "will recommend this game to anyone who loves survival game's", "timestamp_created": 1551350078, "timestamp_updated": 1551350078, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.52173912525177002", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49344657": {"recommendationid": "49344657", "author": {"steamid": "76561198358016051", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 79784, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 615, "last_played": 1551652353}, "language": "english", "review": "love it i love finding little bits and glitches in creative\n", "timestamp_created": 1551650091, "timestamp_updated": 1551650091, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.481675416231155396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49331489": {"recommendationid": "49331489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198839058636", "num_games_owned": 30, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 41011, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1811, "last_played": 1551600247}, "language": "english", "review": "Dont get me wrong, it can be a very fun game playing with friends, but due to the infinite headaches this game has caused in the several hundred hours played, I cant recommend.

So my review is based off older gameplay.\n\nTLDR: \nPvP = Toxic\nPvE = Pillars Everywhere\nSolo/Private Servers = where the fun is\nDevelopers = Avoid\n\nAs with a good amount of multiplayer games, the community is horrid. Last I played, anything I built on PvP servers was lucky to last more than 24 hours before the bigger tribes decide they either don't like where I am, or just straight up don't want new people joining \"their\" server. I even tried sticking to just living off a boat, figured if I'm not claiming land space, they wont complain about how I'm in their way, right? ... Apparently there are \"no parking zones\" ...\n\nNo problems with being run off on PvE servers (obviously), but good luck finding somewhere to build, as people loved to \"claim\" land by putting pillars everywhere. But as long as you can find some space and get started, there's little to worry about on these servers.\n\nThe only reason I actually gave a \"yes\" on the recommend is simply for the fact of being able to play on a private server. As a mostly solo player, the rates of collection/gains on official servers makes the grind horrible. Playing solo/private server, you are able to up the rates to compensate for the lack of people.\n\nThe developers really did not help how I feel about the game. The only DLC I bought was Scorched Earth (was on sale for like 5 dollars). The timing and execution was just awful; still in early access, buggy as hell, but we're gonna release a $20 DLC anyways. From what I have read on reddit, it seems they have stepped up their game after a couple individuals started to work on the Ark Ocean DLC... I mean the \"new game\" Atlas.

There are bosses and things, but these fights aren't engaging at all and take forever to even prepare for. The boss fights consist of you getting a bunch of your best dinos and putting them on aggressive while you sit in the back and watch. The hitboxes this game has are also one of the major issues I have with it. The hitboxes are somehow worse than garrys mod hitboxes, with you shooting a slow, huge enemy at point blank, seeing your arrow hit it and blood come out, and it doesn't register as a hit 50% of the time. This is also problem when riding of wyverns, because if you dismount one while they are shooting, their hitbox for their right click attack reaches up their entire back and kills the rider instantly. Late game, progression slows to a halt and instead of seeing anything new, you just breed dinos and waste days of your time watching a timer click down on when you need to imprint and feed them.\nThis game was fun when I first started playing, but I quickly saw that all the farming wasn't worth it in the end when fights are extremely rare and not engaging at all.

It had a bed and some storage containers and was starting to feel pretty safe. I hadn't seen many dangerous Dino other that dilos (the ones that killed the fat guy in Jurassic park). I had stockpiled some goods and decided I would go try to tame something worth taming. \n\tI found a raptor in a valley surrounded by rocks and decided he was gonna be my buddy. The taming process was pretty intense so it really made me want to keep my Raptor safe. I saddled him up and decided to give him a go. He was amazing, we ran around killing everything. After about 30 mins of running and killing things I decided to go home and give my new buddy a rest. We ran through the night and in the morning i realized how extra lost i was and got worried. I decided that the best way to find my way home was to climb a mountain and look around. After 5 mins or so of looking and referencing the map I finally figured out where we were. Just as I was about to put my map away I was ambushed by several scorpions and unfortunately they killed me. \n\tAfter I respawned back at my base I was in panic mode and jumped on my only other ride able Dino which was a Parasaur and hauled ass back to where my raptor was. We never made it. About halfway there we were attacked by a pack of raptors and both were killed. My next re-spawn was kinda bleak from the start. I re-spawn in a random location that I thought would be near my Dino. After what seemed like hours of carefully navigating my map back to where i though my Dino was I started to freeze and starve. I would move thirty to fifty feet and whistle then repeat. The sun went down and my hopes for recovering my dino with it. Just as I had given up hope I was surrounded by scorpions and I thought \"oh well\". A second later my Raptor jumped down from the rocky ledges above and killed one of the scorpions. I frantically jumped on his back and ran from the other scorpions. My health was still falling due to the cold and me starving. Once we got to relative safety I hopped off his back and checked his inventory. Somehow he had collected a full suit of armor and plenty of berries whilst we were hunting earlier. We eventually dodged meat eaters and found our way home once the sun rose. \n\tI have never felt that since of disparity and relief from a video game before. It sounds funny but it really felt like the raptor saved my life. I've never got that into a game before. That one experience was worth more than what I paid for the game.", "timestamp_created": 1439774944, "timestamp_updated": 1439774944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2397, "votes_funny": 725, "weighted_vote_score": "0.957818865776062012", "comment_count": 95, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16370444": {"recommendationid": "16370444", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027138724", "num_games_owned": 345, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 824, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505467758}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]\u251cProfessors Review\u2524[/h1]\n\n[b]Game Pros[/b]\n \u2022 Open World\n \u2022 Weapons ranging from spears, to rocket launchers, and turrets\n \u2022 Weather System\n \u2022 Multiplayer\n \u2022 Crafting system\n \u2022 Consistent updates\n \u2022 Day/Night Cycle\n \u2022 Ton of skills to master\n \u2022 Base building\n \u2022 Grouping/Spawning System\n \u2022 PvP/PvE\n \u2022 You can tame/ride dinosaurs\n \u2022 Steam workshop\n \u2022 Selfie/Orbit Cam so you can look at yourself\n \u2022 You can host Servers and have access to console commads\n \u2022 3rd person (Can be accessed on servers that have it enabled)\n \n[b]Game Cons[/b]\n \u2022 Requires a very decent PC to achieve stable FPS\n \u2022 Dinosaurs hover on certain terrain (Very minor)\n \u2022 Dinosaurs need pathfinding work\n \u2022 Chance of spawning on a hostile dinosaur, killing you upon spawn\n \u2022 [b]WARNING[/b]: Hackers\n \u2022 Developers released DLC before the game was anywhere closed to finished\n \u2022 Terrible optomization for full priced game.

I'll explain why this game is a full time job later on, but basically it punishes any player that can't or won't play it 24/7. \n\nFirst I'll talk about the PvE. I started playing PvE on a private server with friends and had tons of fun discovering everything there is to enjoy. We started on The Center, the biggest and in my opinion the coolest of the three maps. The beginning is the hardest part for new players. Every dino you meet can easily kill a noob, even the spitter dinos. It can be annoying running around naked and getting killed by raptors, but stick with it and find your friends and build a safe place. Once you get the base built, the game gets so much more fun. Every new dino you find is cool, and it so fun the first time you get all your friends together and explore a cave. The most dangerous foes we encountered in PvE were the alpha predators. Our base got killed multiple times by alpha raptors, but it was fun because it showed us that even though we had a big base with spike walls and gaurd towers, there was still a threat out there that had to be beaten. Ofcourse once you build a metal base nothing can break it anymore and once you tame flying mounts you don't have to worry about dangerous expeditions so late game it got boring. We basically got to the point that nothing PvE had to throw at us outside of boss battles was a challenge, and even fighting bosses had no point because what would we use the tek gear to kill? Harder versions of that boss? That's why we decided to turn to PvP to see if that was better late game.\n\nPro tip, don't PvP. This game is designed in such a way that the big tribes that are on top stay on top. New tribes and new players just get pooped on in every single way unless they join an alpha and become a resource harvesting slave. Let's walk through all the reason PvP is horrible.\n\n1.) Alpha tribes. They wipe the server once or twice a week and completly blow up any new players base and kill their dinos. They own the server, they won't let anyone else even enjoy the game.\n\n2.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get a base, they might let you live in a thatch hut. Refer to reason 1.) \n\n3.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to tame dinos, they might let you tame dodos. Refer to reason 1.)\n\n4.) Unless you're alpha, you don't get to upgrade any of your gear. Alphas block all loot drops (the good ones anyway) and fill all the caves with auto-turrets to gun down anyone that tries to explore them.\n\n5.) Alpha tribes are literally impossible for smaller tribes to fight. They have huge metal bases with hundreds and hunderds of turrets and plants that will mow you down if you so much as look at it wrong. Rockets get shot down in mid air by these turrets, and you won't get close enough to plant c4. You won't be able to bring dinos to tank the turret either, refer to 1.)\n\n6.) Offline-raiding. Just imagine working for 2-3 weeks building a pretty cool base completely surrounded by plant-x and taming about 20 dinos then logging on to see a smoking crater where you base was. You don't get to save any of your gear, you don't get to save any of your dinos, you don't even get to fight back, it's all just gone. This happens all the time, and honestly offline-raid protection should be baseline on all servers.\n\n7.) Battlemetrics. Alpha tribes and griefers use this website to figure out if you are online or not. If you log off for some reason, sleep or work or whatever, then they will know and they will raid you. They can even get text alerts that tell them the second you have logged off or on, or if anything else unusual is going on on \"their\" server. Basically, this site and sites like it are cancer. Also, it doesn't tell them your in game name, but you steam name, that means even if you make another character they will know it's you. Also, if you piss them off and try to go to another server, they can just look up where you went using Battlemetrics and come find you. There is no hiding and no escape, so you have to be nice and can't even PvP or else some loser with no life is going to come and find you on every single server you go to.\n\n8.) Breeding. Just another way to keep big tribes ontop. They have huge metal air-conditioned rooms where they hatch 20 eggs at once, each hatched dino gonna be 2x the level of anything a noob will have.\n\n9.) Tek gear. If the fact that they have 2-3x better gear by monopolizing all loot crates wasn't a big enough edge, if the fact that they have 2-3x better dinos by building huge breeding rooms wasn't a big enough edge, now they get tek gear too. If they come at you with anything tek and you have baseline gear and baseline dinos, you are DEAD!\n\n10.) Ark is a full-time job. You must log on every day to feed dinos or they will die. Breeding and imprinting are horrible and time consuming processes that I won't even touch. You must log on every day to make sure you haven't been raided, and you must grind harder than everyone else to make sure you have the defenses and dinos to stop raiders. Don't try, you won't. \n\nLook, I'm tired of typing this review, just know that if you enjoy PvP because you enjoy winning through skill, then don't PvP. No Pvp skill required at this point, their gear will have much higher armor and damage, their dinos will have much higher hp and damage, just accept your death and wipe multiple times because you will lose everything and you won't even be online to defend it, not like you'd have a chance if you were.\n\nEDIT:\nI never expected my review to actually be popular, but now that it is I feel like I should address all the kids telling me I suck and that I'm still a noob who doesn't know what he's talking about.\n\nFirstly, this is NOT a skill based game. This is a grind based, offline raid based, exploit based game. You can't come here and say I'm a noob, especially when I've played the game solo as a small tribe for over 300 hours, and I joined an alpha tribe for a week or two so I know how it goes on a larger scale. My opinion actually got even worse after joining the aplha tribe, because I realized just how bad the game panders to these alpha tribes. Here are some more reasons I found from my time with the alphas why I will never recommend this game to anyone.\n\n1.) Alpha tribes can grind resources WAY easier than a new player. Now, you would probably expect this. After all, they have more players so it is only natural that they could send 5 out to grind while your tribe could only spare 1. No, numbers isn't even what I'm talking about here, I'm talking about EXPLOITS with a farming dino and a Quetzal. A noob with a hatchet can get 50-60 wood from a single tree. An alpha tribe can get 1500 wood from a single tree. A noob with a pickaxe can get 50-60 metal from a vein, an alpha tribe can get 300 metal from a vein. A noob would take hours to farm 1-2k metal, an alpha tribe can farm 20-30k metal in an hour. The list goes on and every single resource you can think of they can get insane amounts much faster and easier. Now, noobs wont know how to do this, and wouldn't be able to because Quetzals are hard to tame, and hard to hide from alpha tribes. If they saw you flying around harvesting, they would bring a Wyvern after you and start looking for your base.\n\n2.) Large scale PvP is extremely laggy. The servers are supposed to support up to 100 players, but if you get more than 20 players in a server, the lag becomes unbearable. Once again, Alpha tribes exploit this by logging as many people as they can onto a server (kind of like DDOS) to block out defenders from connecting, or to force the server to get so laggy that you can basically avoid taking damage from things.", "timestamp_created": 1494042615, "timestamp_updated": 1496242505, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2421, "votes_funny": 92, "weighted_vote_score": "0.927921533584594727", "comment_count": 158, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16799579": {"recommendationid": "16799579", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008897445", "num_games_owned": 153, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 11344, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497259340}, "language": "english", "review": "Since most people are bashing the PvP servers for the griefing, I feel like someone should answer that and also talk a bit about the PvE servers.\n\nRight now I got close to 130 hours in the game, about half of that on PvP servers and half of that on PvE, all official ones. All the thing people say about the griefers is true, they'll kill your dinos, steal your stuff, abuse your body and destroy your house as soon as you go to sleep. In fact a lot of tribes organize group to play past midnight for the sole reason of hunting sleeping players. And that's the keyword here TRIBES. If you're playing on a PvP server you gotta keep in mind that you're not supposed to do it at your pace and take your time building your little Tatch hut with it's little thatch fence with your Raptor and a couple of Dilos. Slowly learning the game by yourself, taking everything in, eventually upgrading to Wood and then Stone and so forth.\n\nI'm sorry but I got to burst your bubble right now: If you plan on playing in a PvP server you gotta take this game seriously. You either find a group of friends to play with you or you join a Tribe as soon as possible. If you play alone you might find a hidden spot where your stuf will be safe one or two nights, maybe even a week, but alone you're doomed to be found, robbed and killed. And like many others said, have the work of a whole week go down the drain. If you're joining a PvP server you're doing it for Tribe warfare and let me assure you, thing can get really intense, really epic pretty fast. With eagles swooping down to grab enemies and droping them from high altitues to their deaths, or tactical droping Raptors inside their base to wreak havok, T-Rexes working as battering rams at the enemies gates while rockets fly at them, auto-turrets spewing bullets at your Carno army, Sabretooths leaping over walls. It is a beauty to behold.\n\nBut you'll only experience that if you join one of the dominating tribes on your server or work on creating a strong Tribe of your own. Otherwise you'll just be cattle for them, nothing else. They'll keep you from taming dinos by killing them mid proccess, block caverns so only they can harvest the resources, literally kidnap you to use you as a blood bag Mad Max style and so on.\n\nI get why so much people hate that, after all they're just being preayed upon, they're not participating in all the fun that is Tribe Wars. But the only way to Tribe Wars be so much fun is allowing all this kind of freedom the game has right now, they gotta allow people to be complete a-holes because during wars that's what you gotta be. If they put too many safety nets to keep people who wanna do PvP only when THEY wanna do PvP the game would be boring and stale.\n\nBut if everything I said right now put you off, don't be. First of all because you don't really need PvP for this game to be fun. There's a TON of stuff to do in PvE servers or offline if you just wanna do everything at your pace. I got a bit tired of all the pressure on PvP servers and have been playing in a PvE for around 60 hours right now. And I still only got only a Wood base with some Dinos, just hit level 45, and I feel like I'll never run out of things to do because the devs just keep adding and adding stuff almost each day. People are also very helpful on PvE servers, they'll give you a hand when you have problems with a Rex, help you gather Prime meat when you're taming a Carnivore, give you tips and materials. At least on my server I got absolutely nothing to complain about them.\n\nAnd if you're still one of the guys who wanna grow at your pace and only participate on PvP when you're ready, REJOICE! Because they'll soon add War Declaration to PvE servers, so tribes can actually go at war when they feel like it, without all the griefing to new players who want just to keep to themselves.\n\nAs a closing statement, I'd like to congratulate the Devs. They're doing a terrific job. Optimization is alreayd a LOT better, still not there yet, but much better. The content is fantastic and it just keeps coming. Bugs are rarer and rarer, in fact I don't even remember the last time I experienced one.\n\nAn all around great game that I fully recommend if you're into dinossaurs and survival games.

Thus my review will pertain to Official Servers.\n\nArk Survival Evolved is a game that will make you feel many things.  Initially you will feel frustration at your helplessness as you spawn nude on a beach at level one and can barely fend off the smallest of dinosaurs.  Then you will meet people, these people will either be total jerks and just kill you over and over, or they will be really chill, and you'll form a tribe with them.  You will spend countless hours with these people: farming materials, taming dinosaurs, and build bases.  You will grow more and more in power.  You will be meeting other players either passing through the server or settling down.  You will know all the other tribes on the server that are worth knowing (i.e. the big tribes or friendly tribes).  You will come across numerous other cultures as you find Chinese tribes and Spanish tribes, French and German, all while growing more and more powerful.  You will on occassion have a set back, but at this point you're on a roll and now the games mechanics, have a good group of friends, and objectives that you have given yourself.  You will feel happy with what you have accomplished.  \n\nBut there is a downside.  There must always be conflict, while it can be delayed for long periods of time, it will eventually come.  And so another tribe will pick a fight with you.  Your tribe will fight their tribe, and you may lose or you may win.  Either way you've invested a lot into this server and these friends, so you'll never give up.  Some other tribes will jointhe fight, picking sides.  The winning side will probably kill all the dinos, take all the mats, and kill everyone on the losing side.  Thus you have won your first war.  You are now a power on the server worth being reckoned with.  Soon enough, you'll get in an even bigger war as the losing side draws more and more people to aide them and you respond by getting more as well.  Now the entire server is split 50-50, and a great war mars the server for days as both sides are constantly wiping one anothers bases.  Eventually you'll win though, and the other side will leave the server.  They'll be fed up.  As the enemies are now gone, you are happy once more.  You hated them just as they hated you.  \n\nNow a long period of peace has passed, a couple weeks.  There is trouble brewing as a few of your allies are begin to grow wrestless and have infighting.  Peace will try to be maintained through talks.  But it will fail in the end, and more war will arise.  This cycle will continue until only 2 tribes remain.  These two tribes will be dominant in every regard: leadership, tactics, dinosaurs, and materials.  Pitted against one another to see who will rule the server.  You will fight your heart out against your former allies.  You will destroy bases you'd once entered as a friend, now as an enemy.  You will kill dinos whose names you helped come up with.  You and your tribemates will be cycling out who gets to sleep because the battle will last over 24 hours.  The fight will go on and on and on and on with no end.  It will be exhilerating.\n\nThen you win.  Then you are the supreme ruler of the server.  You are standing over the ruins of your former allies as you have proved yourself to be the mightiest.  But then it will hit you.  The sadness. As now all the people you had once known, months ago when you were just a little tribe starting out, will all be gone.  Everyone you'd ever fought with and fought against are gone.  While there is some joy in victory, it is very bitter as there is no one left to share it with.  Your tribemates will still play, but it's not the same.  Even if not in your tribe, you had a community. Friends. Foes. Maybe even lovers.  Now all that is gone.  You will pass the ruins of these once great tribes and feel a hole in your heart.  New people will always arrive to challenge you, but you'll always beat them down.  Destroying any hope they had.  You'll build fortresses that'll reach the Heavens and have so many dinos it'll cause server lag.  You'll build Great Walls across vast territories in order to denote your power.  Finally, you'll get bored and leave.\n\nMonths will pass, and one day you'll see Ark still in your library and hop back on.  You'll log back into your old server.  Everything is different.  New names, faces, bases, everything.  Not a single structure you had built is left standing, not a single ruin.  All of it is gone.  The people on this server see you log in and ask if you want to join their tribe saying that 'Ark can be harsh for noobs', but you could never tell them.  You could never tell them an entire servers history.  The hundreds of thousands of hours of work you'd seen put in by that ancient world.  The structures they couldn't ever even imagine.  The wars you'd fought and people you'd met.  You could never explain to them what it all had meant to you, for it is all now gone.  In it's place is a new world, completely distinct from the original while maintaining a strong similarity.  You will be both extremely happy at this new world, and profoundly sad about the world that was lost.\n\nArk Survival Evolved will demand dozens of hours to just get the basics down and get priorities straight.  To become a power on a server will take about a hundred hours.  To conquer a server will take a couple hundred hours.  To realize everything you lost and destroyed that you once held dear will take thousands of hours.  To atone for everything you'd done to those you once called friends will take an eternity.\n\nIf you'll pour time and effort, no game will ever make you feel as strongly about the decisions you've made than Ark: Survival Evolved.  Beware that you may get addicted and lose your real social life and ambitions in exchange for this game.  But you'll meet people you'd never have met otherwise, see things you never thought possible, commit acts that would make tyrants think you're true evil or saints believe you are the second coming of Jesus Christ.  In the end, you'll feel stronger emotions then any you've ever felt from playing a game.\n\n10/10 Masterpiece.", "timestamp_created": 1461198177, "timestamp_updated": 1498963373, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1264, "votes_funny": 332, "weighted_vote_score": "0.948348402976989746", "comment_count": 81, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18083865": {"recommendationid": "18083865", "author": {"steamid": "76561198048146169", "num_games_owned": 99, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 25568, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504471662}, "language": "english", "review": "First review i wrote for a game but it had to be done!\n\nThis game is like Crack! \n\nI've put a few hundred hours into this game and will probably put in a few hundred more. The devs are constantly pushing out new content (to a point where all the server maintenance is starting to become annoying haha) and they are very involved with the community trough reddit etc. \n\nMe and two friends of mine started off on a public server and had a really nice welcoming, A nearby chinese tribe gave us some stuff to start out and we we're hooked to the game pretty much instantly. There were some big tribe wars going on on the server but we were left alone.\n\nA few weeks later. \n\nwe have a huge metal base with a 5 high stone wall perimiter around it and 5 more people joined our tribe. All the big tribes but the chinese one left the server and got wiped out. And it seemed peaceful At this point we already spent hundreds of hours taming different dinos (which each have their different role like gathering resources, carrying heavy loads, transportation, combat, you name it) and we eventually also tamed a few t-rexes and the stronger end game dino's. You name them all and because of their different tasks and stat builds you become sort of attached to your dino's as well which makes the game even better.\n\nOne week later.\n\n Random (smaller tribes) are getting destroyed at night when they are offline. all the buildings blown open resources stolen and dinos killed. (take note some dinos can take over 10 hours to tame without kibble) At this point our base is more like a fortress we have over 70 organic turrets (think plants that split acid to hostiles) and 10 auto Gatlin turrets with loads of ammo in them. And an army of all kinds of dino's over 50 including 5 t-rexes varying from lvl 150-200+ A fully metal layered base with different compartments with different resources in every room (makes it harder for raiders to get everything since they have to blow up more walls) \n\nThe chinese tribe starts putting in random text in global chat in capital letters including our tribe name. they have always helped us out we have made multiple trades with them for resources and called them allies. \n\nThe next day. \n\nI log on.\nEverything is gone.... all our dino's are dead every wall is blown up all our turrets taken out. and our base is in ruins. \nHundreds of hours of building up Taming dino's training them taking them out on resource runs and working together with a tribe....gone....\n\nThe chinese tribe who helped us out from day one, Destroyed us.\n\nRIP.\nAtlas\nAbraxis\nNien\nTalon\nAeon\nMckitten\nMcCat\nMcMuffin\nMike the trike\nBob the trike\nArmageddon\nMorgoth\nApocalypse \nAnkrahmun\nAnkaderp\nMuffin\nDeem\nDemonspawn\nSharkenator\nLulu\nRammus\nRockey\nStoney\nScorpenator\nMitten\nRappy\nOmega\nMammutan\nWoolly\nMamenamenamenan\nCarny\nBrontenator\n\nAnd many more....\n\nThat empty hollow feeling seeing your base in ruins and all your tamed fed and cared for dino's dead. I never had that before in a game.\n\n3 days later.\n\n we set up camp a few miles west from our old base. we had primitive tools and we were back to square one. \nBut we we're determined and longing for revenge.... \nwe broke down some old metal walls en made a small 4x4 room and set up the basic crafting stations. We had good contact with a few of the smaller tribes nearby who we helped out countless of times. now we needed their help. we secretly banded together against the Chinese tribe and they gave us some of the harder to obtain resources like crystal and oil.\n\nWe started mass producing grenades.\n\nI went out at night with a stash of metal tools a crossbow, arrows and food and approached their base. The chinese built a enormous stone castle on the water where they stored most of their Egg farm dino's in. I went to the beach. swam underneath the base. found a spot where i could hack away at their stone walls to get inside. Found a good spot and made a start. tribe members brought over grenades and we blew though the wall. Out came charging a T-rex and 5 raptors at insane speed. we started backing off while firing at them. The water slowed them down. Called for the rest of the tribe to head over. we ended up fighting them on foot with primitive weapons. After a long fight we took them out one by one and eventually they all lay dead. That feeling of Vengeance is undescribable. but we weren't satisfied. We headed back into the dino pen and laid waste to their entire egg farm, we killed over 20 Stego's three mammoths and a few ankylo's, It was a massacre. Fueled by the loss of our pets and friends. \n\nToday, \n\nwe're still fighting a guerrilla style war against the Chinese. Constantly on the move hitting them where they expect it the least.\n\nOnly a handfull of people remain on the server but we won't rest untill we have taken everything from them... like they did to so many others.\n\n\n\nApoligies for the grammar mistakes etc. English is not my native language. \n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1442583944, "timestamp_updated": 1442583944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1383, "votes_funny": 946, "weighted_vote_score": "0.9438934326171875", "comment_count": 101, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "16210290": {"recommendationid": "16210290", "author": {"steamid": "76561197970322108", "num_games_owned": 417, "num_reviews": 12, "playtime_forever": 8050, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504343388}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm at a point where I'm about to hit 20 solid hours of gaming and feel I have a good enough grasp of the game to review it.

I can't even count how many. I recall yesterday having downloaded over 10 different patches through Steam. Seemed like one every hour. \n\nFor me, that's HUGE. A developer that actually TRIES to set the example and improve on their product.

Used to be 200's until I wanted ARK back.\nBEFORE YOU PLAY THE GAME\n1.) Change inventory keybinding to Tab. Make console \"~\" Plays off very fluent.\n2.) 5,000+ Negative reviews about optimization, You need more than just a great graphics card. This game is more CPU          dependant, I'm using an old 550gtx card and runs pretty smooth and with custom video settings it looks just fine. Tweak with everything for a few minutes, you'll find a good enjoyable setting. Unless you're running an old IBM pc. (lol)\n3.) Note that you can customize your character down to hand size, male/female, etc. My only downside is somehow I still look the same as everyone.\nOFF TO THE GAMEPLAY\n1.) Unique inventory system, you have a mysterious impant in your hand which is the HUD for everything. You learn how to craft everything without a single blueprint through engrams, which better items require certain higher level. There are blueprints to find for a shortcut, but you never Really need them. EDIT: Blueprints can be BETTER than just the original engram I.E higher armor or durability. Survival is basic eat/drink over time it decays like rust, etc.\n2.) Supply Drops, (I assume everyone is a test subject sent to this planet and these drops are hi tech packages warped to the land by the Army/Scientist) are also unique rather than a box that falls from a random helicopter. They are level restricted from level 5 to level 45 (so far I've seen). Can drop nearly anything in the game. I.E. Level 5 drop gave me an entire 1 square house, door and all. Drops have a cool and unique item model and the way drops work is just sci-fi-ish and refreshing.\n3.) Crafting is Very seamless, pretty much a basic system though, which works just fine for replayablity. Repairs are on the spot until you get better items then you'll use the Smithy. You can refine items so they won't break when you level higher.\n4.) Weather system/Temperature is neat. You get hot and cold, leading to burning or freezing to death after a long while. So far I've only seen rain and heavy fog as far as precipitaion. Hopefully while server days pass and development continues We will see snow and disasters such as tornados, typhoons, etc.\n5.) Combat. Let's be frank. Task Manager Says is all under processes = \"Shooter Game\" Basic swing and strike for melee. Iron sights for ranged. Online combat is sketchy due to ping. But Singleplayer/Local is very solid. There are multiple weapon attachments as well. \n6.) Physics in the game are great, due to Unreal 4. But I will ADD THE FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE TWEAKED. At first I died nearly encumbered falling from maybe a 3 meter drop (thinking, oh I had alot on me it would hurt more). Only to die off the same drop being naked to get my gear back. So water, landscapes, foliage, all great. But FALLING DAMAGE NEEDS TO BE REDUCED. \n7.) Dinosaurs (they are currently adding a multitude of species). Right now there are maybe a dozen different dinos and animals. Like a sabertooth tiger, mammoth, sharks etc. All very well produced and modeled. Sometimes pathing is a little bad, I kill T-Rex's and Bronto just because they get stuck in trees or up a mountain side. Other than that, all dinos attack as they should and look great doing so. The taming method is very tedious, but unique. If you USE a nonlethal weapon on a dino they will go unconsious, which will have a meter telling you how long, and also a meter bar for taming. You simply place the food in their \"inventory\" wait and protect. Simple yet tedious. Making saddles are level required as well. (i'm to the point in local-play to just \"~ ForceTame\")\n8.) Building is best described as rust or h1z1. Simple place foundation and addon. Yet there are alot of extra things you can do, such as catwalks, ladders, water pipes to transport a water source 17423 miles away. Also pipes can help you find your way around areas (I used some as placements and arrows). There is a modern aspect to building as well. Such as air conditioners, refridgerators, lamps, turrets, all need to be powered by generator and electrical wires. So that's a grade A move, on my part. Also if you play online just simply beware, this is a survival game. Meaning people are psycho.\n9.) Finally last and foremost, you can defecate, shit, poop, take a number two, talk to a horse named john, pop a squat, and pick it right up to fertilize your crops (which is VERY nessecary in my case)\nSO OVERALL\nThis game is still in development, it does have it's lower qualities, which I mentioned. BUT, I can see why this game is coming to my Xbox One and PS4, rather than Rust, Dayz (never happening), H1Z1 (who is really gunna play that?), or many other survival games. It is simply because this game has all of the qualities of a AAA game and showed them to a playable extent, which companies like Steam, Sony, and Microsoft will gladly support. And for people who have not been able to play the game. Buy it on your Next Gen console because \"PC master race, right?\" \n\nThanks to anyone who reads this long a$$ review.

Though to myself after makeing a spear, fish should be easy food to catch, I swam out to a big boulder just where the sea got alittle deeper, spotting a fish getting rdy to jump into the water and spearing it i saw a big shadow comming closer.... a shark the size of 2 cars....\n\nI spend a cold night out on that rock.\n\nWorking my way north along the shoreline looking for a good spot to call home i came across a dino that was left for dead that i decided to tamed.

After 3 long night and days he finaly woke up and i had my first companion.\n\nFor a time all was well i was building the house on a hill loverlooking the shore, My dino i came to call Fido was defending me and the house without mercy.

Outnumberd and outpowerd we fought them side by side for almost 30 min killing off 6 of the 8 attackers when Fido didnt have anymore fight in him and fell to the ground to never raise again. I without any backup was no match for the remaining two and i had to fall back into my house and gather as mutch of my resources i could carry and the flee.

I have been playing it for over a year now and have had a lot of ups and downs. I play on a PvP server and I have had everything I had taken from me and all my tames killed many times. I have worked my way back up over and over and have managed to secure my tribe as a beta tribe on a server and am in an alliance with the alpha tribe.\n\nThen Wild Card dropped Scortched Earth and the ability to transfer players and items into the server I play on. My server did everything we could to protect ourselves and it paid off. Then Wild Card made all the supply drops not effected by structures so they would still drop. So, we blocked them all off with vaults. Now Wild Card made it so the drops land on top of anything under them. We don't have any defense against that.\n\nWhy are we worried? Because for the better part of the last year, many servers have been taken over completely my mega tribes. Tribes that regularly hit server cap with who plays on the server. Who farm servers of all their resources and have been unchecked because no one could farm enough resources to fight them on their own servers. Now that they can travel from server to server, they are slowly working their way through all official servers and wiping the servers of everything.\n\nFor people like myself who have dumped litterally thousands of hours into this game, we are doing all we can to defend, but we can only do so much as we can't be online all day everyday. With the servers not being region locked, we have Chinese, Russian, and Australian tribes coming to our server during peak times for them, but the early morning hours for us. Meaning, we have no one on to defend what we worked hard to make. We now have to work in shifts, like it is a job, to defend what we have, all because Wild Card decided to open the arks up and have the players wipe the servers for them.\n\nWhen a large server falls, most of the players quit playing the game. They move onto something else. That is good for Wild Card, because then the servers become low population, so they can repurpose them or remove them and that saves them a lot of money. They already made all they will make off of the players currently playing. So, if they remove us, they can save on server costs and use that for more advertising to get more unsuspecting players into the game.\n\nOverall, Wild Card doesn't listen to their players unless those players are praising how great the game is. The players that riducule the game, are ignored or banned due to rule violations. Wild Card doesn't know what they are doing in terms of making a game that isn't completely broken nor do they know how to have a conversation with their player base that isn't just the positive things about the game. They refuse to hear or even acknowledge there is anything wrong with their game and that is a huge problem.\n\nBottom line, only get this game if you're going to play on unofficial servers or you like logging in and finding that everything you have is gone, yet again, and you get to punch a tree and start over.\n\nADDED February 02, 2017:\n\nI mainly talked about the PvP on Official servers in the review above, so I am adding the other ways to play the game here to hopefully give a more well rounded review.\n\nSingle Player is nice as well, but nothing is persistant. So you need to increase a lot of rates in single player to make it fun. Like, at stock, if taming something takes 6 hours, you need to be logged into the game for 6 hours to tame it. If you exit, that timer pauses. Breeding anything becomes too cumbersome without increasing rates because 4 real life days that pauses when you exit the day is just not possible. Unless you want it taking 2 weeks to raise one thing. I just use single player as a \"creative mode\" to spawn everything in and build to see what I would need for the server I actually play on.\n\nPvE is enjoyable but frustrating in a different way. You can't build near others and as long as you close your doors, no one can take your things. People can annoy you and get in your way and just be asshats to you, and you can't do anything to them because you can't fight them. They can build walls around your base at the build limit so you can't get out or in. It's like the 12 year olds at malls that will be annoying little shits and and when you tell them to quit being shits, they try to egg you on by telling you that you can't do anything because they are a minor and you can't hit them. Just really disrespectful. In some cases it's worse than PvP.\n\nThe unofficial servers are nice as it's less assholes and more good players. Though, then you run the risk of the admins of the servers spawning in whatever they want and wiping the server anytime without notice. So, you could log in and the whole server is wiped and you lost everything. They could change up the mods on the server without notice and just shut the server down because they didn't want to pay for it anymore. If you're playing PvP on their server and you wipe them and become alpha, they can just delete everything you have, rollback the server to before you wiped them, spawn in a level 1million titanosaur and smash everything you have, or any combination of those.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is that it's not fun anymore. It was fun for the last year and with the last few months of updates, it's just not fun anymore. You can have a lot of fun on unofficial servers, but they are also very volatile as well. Maybe more so than PvP official servers. The way I see it, is that if you never played this game before and you join a server, you should have fun right away. You shouldn't have to join unofficial servers and add mods to the game to make it fun. To me, that says the developers failed at their job for making a fun game. Sure, int he future, you might get bored of the offical servers and mod the game to get some NEW excitement out of it, but you shouldn't have to mod a game after you bought it in order to get fun from it.\n\nIf Wild Card wants to keep all transfers open the way they have it now when you can transfer creatures, players, and items from server to server, then I suggest they do a full wipe of every server so everyone has a fair start to build up. Otherwise the mega tribes that basically own official servers have so much unchecked power to just wipe servers and take all their resources and get even bigger. There isn't any hope to fight them off.\n\nBut, if Wild Card just limits you transferring your character, that would be better as then you need to build up on a server. I have seen a few smaller tribes band together and wipe alphas that are just mean and ruin your day for fun. It happened on my server last year. The alpha we have now is friendly and helps the server anytime they can and uses their power to defend the server against attacks.\n\nEDIT: I haven't edited anything on this review. I just wanted to add that I replied in the comments to reply to the comments I received about this review.\n\nEDIT 2: I still haven't changed my initial review, just wanted to add two things that I know no one will read.\n\n1. In my comments below that are back pages at this point, I made a typo regarding my family. I said they were all dead, I meant to say they were all dead to me. They are all alive, but very toxic, hateful people and I don't talk to them unless I absolutely need to.\n\n2. Since I posted this, I keep getting friend request from people. I'm denying every single one of them because I'm just assuming you are all trolls going to harrass me or come to my server and wipe it. Though, that would speed up the process of me quitting the game as I wouldn't have anything left to go back to.\n\nEDIT 3: I added into the main review about the other game modes so people would stop commenting about them. But, none of them will actually read the review and just call me names and say I don't have a life.

The veteran players have made them virtually unplayable for new players. Entered an official PvE server, was instantly killed by a level 75 Raptor as I was spawning into one of the low level spawn points (probably from a veteran player kiting it there). Spawned at a different low level spawn and couldn't even build the basic campfire because all of the veteran players set up pillars everywhere to prevent others from placing any building pieces down as they can't be destroyed on a PvE server. Spent most of the time trying not to starve to death because the only food I could harvest was berries, and berries do so little to fill your food meter that you are basically eating them like you were stuffing your face in a food eating competition. Whenever you do die (and it will happen allot), you can sometimes respawn inside other players' houses. When that happens the only thing you can do is wish for the sweet release of death as you slowly starve, trapped in a building where all the doors are locked, the walls are invincible, and no one is online to let you out. Tried spawning in higher level zones in hopes of getting out of the no-build areas the veterans placed everywhere, but found out that the veterans claimed those areas same as the starting zones. Tried running to one of the Obelisks so that I could transfer my progress to a different PvE server in hopes of finding one not so stuffed, but the Veteran players bascially built giant FU walls around them to prevent anyone that didn't have a flying mount from reaching them. Started a new character on a different official PvE server and the exact same problems came up again.\n\nSwitching to a PvP server fixed the problem of invincible pillars everywhere preventing new players from progressing through the building tree. But griefing is the passtime of all the veteran players on PvP servers as they have nothing left to do since it is impossible for anyone to topple an Alpha Tribe. Tried playing on a small tribes official server, but the griefing is still there. Instead of dozens of players griefing you, there is only 3-6 at a time. Got to about level 62 on a small tribes server, and the entire time I was playing I was constantly being reset back to nothing as the veteran players would C4 the hell out of my house, kill all of my tames, and then constantly keep me sedated for hours on end while they played around with my uncouscious body. Whenever they got tired of playing with me (usually the next day as I would get bored of being kept in a vegitative state and log off for the day), I would have to respawn at a starting point and have to redo 6+ hours of work. I'm level 62, I should be working towards stuff like turret entrenched metal houses, crafting powerful gear, and taming strong dinos. But instead I'm spending most of my time trying to rebuild the stone raft house that gets demolished every other day. I even looked up a tutorial on how to build properly, and that still doesn't stop someone from dropping a bunch of C4 on your house and destroying it for the laughs while simultaneously mocking the low level player trying to play the game in global chat. The people at the top are constantly kicking the people at the bottom, preventing them from getting to a position to where they can actually pose a threat and provide interesting gameplay to veterans. As a result of this, the game turns into a fulltime job where you don't get paid, you don't get any work done, prospects for promotion are grim, and everyone you work with act like jerks 24/7.\n\nThe \"get gud\" argument can't applied here simply because there is no level playing field with how the progression system is set up. I would dare anyone who says \"get gud\" to take on a fully outfitted level 105 veteran, butt naked, with nothing but the starting tools. Do that and win consistently, and I would conceed that I need to \"get gud\".\n\nDiseases in this game are unnecessarily brutal, especially if you get one at the start. On the small tribes PvP server that I played, I got infected with Swamp Fever in one of the starting zones within the first few hours of play. Wasn't even sure what was happening until I noticed that my stats were all wrong. As it turns out, diseases stick with your character, even through death. And the only way to cure it is to either make an antidote that requires materials deep in territories packed with predators (and high level players), or transfer to another server to wipe the disease. So I had the choice of either making a brand new character and losing all my progress, transfer my character to another server and then spend hours trying to reach another Obelisk and hope no one would raid my stuff while I was gone, or be gimped until I got to the point where I could take on those higher level players. Lets just say that I chose poorly in that regard (not that any of the choices were anything that should be considered acceptable for new players). What's even scarier is that as I was researching how to cure the disease, I found out that veteran players could use the diseases in a sort of biological warfare against new players. It's apparently possible to infect tamed Dodos and leave them in the starting zones. The amount of griefing tools that the Devs give veterans is just daunting to me. It's like they want to encourage the toxicity to new heights.\n\nSupposedly, some have said unofficial servers will fix these issues. But with the ability of the server owner to become God incarnet in a game that is designed to encourage griefing at every opportunity, I don't have much hope for that making the game better. Most of my encounters with people in the game have been negative on both PvE and PvP servers as the veteran community is rife with toxicity. Out of all of them, I've only met one veteran who was actually nice to me.\n\nI did play on a private server with a friend, and while the world felt a little empty with only two players in it, the survival aspects of the game can be pretty compelling. The game can be rather brutal at times if you happen to wander into a higher level zone before you are ready. But the moment you manage to get a good dinosaur buddy and manage to keep it alive, the gameplay opens up quite a bit. Just remember to take things slow in the beginning and not wander too far from the starting zones.\n\nBase building can be rather clunky and far too restrictive at times. The sloping landscape restricts allot of what you can do and only being able to build new parts parallel or perpendicular to each other will often result in most of the stuff you build looking rather boxy. Sometimes the piece you try to place down is spasming around different snap points like an epileptic at a rave as it tries to decide where it wants to go, and the only choice you have is to drop it and hope for the best. If it is placed wrong, you have to quickly pick it back up otherwise you lose half of the materials when you demolish it (rather steep price for a game with such clunky building mechanics if you ask me). Other times, a piece that looks like it is going in the spot you want snaps either in a wrong orientation or completely different snap point from the one you were looking at. I probably spent about 80% of my time building fighting the poorly designed snap mechanics. I can't help but feel that the building mechanics would be better served if the developers looked at games like Space Engineers where they allow you to easily rotate blocks on a grid.\n\nIf the developers could find a way to prevent veteran players from ruining the experience for new players, this game could be great. Unfortunately, right now, the game is mediocre at best and isn't worth the high price tag so long as the veteran players remain as the gatekeepers to the most compelling parts of the gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1543400402, "timestamp_updated": 1544684729, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 703, "votes_funny": 100, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889689087867736816", "comment_count": 63, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "38296805": {"recommendationid": "38296805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198099307966", "num_games_owned": 232, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 132761, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 26, "last_played": 1551851581}, "language": "english", "review": "First off. I know people are going to read this and go \"You have 1.5k HOURS IN THIS GAME HOW CAN YOU GIVE IT A NEGATIVE REVIEW?\"\n\nEasy. I've played the fuck out of this game. I love it. I split the time playing it between myself and a family member. Interacting with dinosaurs? Amazing. Building a base? Amazing. The overall concept of the game? Amazing. \n\nThe difficulty? There are so many times in this game where something stupid happens and it literally has a domino effect on everything else. It's immersive. You take ONE moment for granted while you're mining, or picking some berries and out of NO WHERE you'll get bum rushed by a large dinosaur who's hungry and wants YOU and your TAMED animal for dinner. Within moments the flying mount you've spent HOURS taming can be gone. It's infuriating. You get so mad, and then you go back, and you rebuild. You go find another dinosaur to tame. YOU won't get beat by the game. Even at higher levels it's difficult. It's unforgiving, and for that I appreciate the game itself.\n\nWhy can't I recommend this game? It's broken. I've been playing since Alpha and there are STILL snapping issues with buildings. You have structures that have clipping issues and make it difficult building things next to each other. You know minor things that can be fixed relatively easily that have just been overlooked.\n\nSome of the dinosaurs are incredibly unbalanced. MicroRaptors  are hands down the worst thing ever introduced to this game. You literally have no way to combat them and they often come out of no where and are found near numerous other dinosaurs that have no issue taking a nibble out of you and your mount while you're stun locked for 10 seconds. It's hard enough being knocked off of your mount. This is just one of the examples I can give as far as how over powered some of the dinosaurs abilities are.\n\nConstant bugs. This game had NO business exiting early access. I can honestly say that. Every single time you roll out a patch you're breaking something within the game. It doesn't necessarily have to be a large patch like the recent one with aberration. Often times it's small little patches that cripple the game system to the point where it's unplayable. I recall a patch not long ago where anytime you went to harvest stone the game would just hard crash each and ever single time. \n\nStuff like this shouldn't be happening to a game that's out of Early Access. \n\nQuite simply. This game was not ready for a full release. It still is not ready for a full release. You shouldn't have game breaking bugs every single time you release a patch. A proper game that is ready for release is Polished. It functions. This game does not fit either of those criteria. It's understandable to have SOME issues with each major patch, and we appreciate how often Wildcard releases patches and adds things to this game, but this game is still by all means an Early Access title. \n\nFor that reason, and that reason alone.

ARK: Survival Evolved is pretty much exactly that, with an added twist of some unexplained sci-fi elements that all tie surprisingly well into the game. But is this Early Access title worth your money and time? Can we trust anyone after the Stomping Lands disaster?\n\nARK puts you in the shoes of a half-naked guy (or gal), stranded on the eponymous ARK, the island the game takes place on. You do get the option to customise your character, although like in many other games, anything but the smack center for most sliders ends up looking ridiculous (hugely muscled, giraffe-necked dwarf or super tall, onyx-skinned valkyrie?), but it is still nice to have the option to go down that path. It should be noted at this point that your characters will be server-specific, meaning you can have one on every server. \nYour character will start the game with nothing to his or her name, true to the survival-game code. You will quickly learn the ways of a hunter-gatherer, as your first task will usually be picking berries and collecting stones. You can also punch trees to get wood, but doing so will damage you (a dig at Minecraft? I like to think so.). \nEven at this early point, the world of ARK does not try to hide its inhabitants from you. Huge, prehistoric beasts roam free over most of the map and there is rarely ever a moment during which you cannot see at least one dinosaur from your location. Not all of these creatures are trying to kill you, however, some just try to live their life in peace. They may even fight each other, as the predators hunt for prey and the latter defends itself. \nPlayers should quickly realise that most of the island's monsters are beyond their combat-capabilities and that they should steer clear of the particularly agressive ones dwelling on land, in the sea and even the air. To help the players deal with these threats and offer some sense of progression at the same time, ARK features a levelling-system. You gain XP at a steady rate over time, with a bonus for doing pretty much anything from gathering and killing to crafting and building. Levelling up will allow you to increase one of your attributes, as well as spend points learning a new crafting-blueprint. While you are barely able to craft torches and stone tools at the beginning of your adventure, later down the line you may pick up the recipes for weapons, buildings and more tools to help you survive. All blueprints cannot be unlocked until a very high level, so specialising in a select few while working together with other players online can be a huge benefit. \nThe unwritten goal in ARK, for most players, is to build a somewhat self-sufficient base for yourself and your tribe. Bases are built using a very simple and easy to understand system of square foundations with snapping walls on their four sides and flat roofs on top. Indeed, whoever has played Rust will immediately feel at home, as the whole game plays very much like it. This includes player's characters falling asleep and remaining in the world whenever their pupeteer disconnects, adding additional treat to potential raiders, who will be able to take all of your character's belongings even when you are not on the server. Of course, building a secure base will help combat this threat. \nWhat sets ARK apart from Rust is its setting (frigging dinosaurs), its general artstyle (sci-fi-looking HUD and inventory/character screen), its graphics (looking seriously impressive) and the fact that you can tame your very own dinos! Instead of killing the giant murder-machines (or players), you can choose to knock them unconscious instead, beginning a rather lengthy taming-process during which you must keep the creature subdued while also feeding it its favoured food. Eventually, it will become your (and your tribe's) companion, able to aid you in combat, bear your burdens and even be ridden as a personal mount (works with flying dinos, too!). What more needs to be said, really.\n\nYes of course, the game has had a rather shaky launch into Early Access. According to the devs, they did not expect such a large resonance initially, which caused most official servers to crack under the pressure and lag. Also, the stunning graphics of ARK come at a price: Your hardware will suffer. At this point in time, you need a fairly beefy machine to be able to play ARK at a reasonable framerate. The devs are aware of this and are currently working on optimising the game to maximise FPS and minimise lag. \nAll of this was to be expected, really and is in no way reason to give ARK a negative review. In fact, the devs claim one of the reasons for the current performance-issues to be their initial focus on content, wanting to give players enough things to do ingame for Early Access, which I think speaks volumes about the good intentions behind this project. \nIndeed, even for Early Access ARK offers a great deal of content and longevity through its progression-system and dinotaming-mechanics, with so much more planned for the future. The performance-issues are being tackled at the time of me writing this review and some first patches have already been rolled out, resulting in some great improvements for a lot of the players.

When I looked at [i]ARK: Survival Evolved [/i] (currently in Early Access on Steam) it looked like just such a thing. When I dug into it and learned that I could host a LAN server in my house, and edit The Island to be a bit less deadly and a bit more generous, went all in with my sons.\n \nBefore long I had all four of my kids playing with me, and each other.\n \nCurrently my girls are the heavy hitters, training mobs of small dinosaurs, and then marching them into harm's way. The game's A.I. spawns some tough beasts, but short of the epic boss battles (which we have not bothered with), and the Alpha T-Rex (which we haven't run into), nothing stands for long against Keliana's swarm of dilophosaurs and dimorphodons, or Gleek's hopping mob of giant frogs.\n \nKeliana and I did run into a bit of trouble with our expedition from the north-east river mouth, but that wasn't her fault. I shall now tell you about it.\n \nWe  attempted to bring 24 tamed dinos and one tricked-out crafting raft southwest through narrows and swamps. We discovered, after it was too late to turn around, that the size of our mob and the size of our raft made the trip extremely tedious. It didn't get dangerous until I got fed up and decided on a side trip.\n \nMy plan was simple. Ride Terry, my pteranodon who kept fouling the raft's travel, from our mob's location at the western edge of the Eastern Plains, east and south to a platform we'd been building in the middle of the Eastern Forest. There he'd be high, dry, and safe. I would then parachute back, timing my glide to get me most of the way to safety. It's a high platform, and I'd seen my son make that kind of glide before.\n \n(Note: The logic that goes \"I saw my son do a thing in a game so it is a thing I can now do\" has never gotten me into trouble before, I swear.)\n \nA dimorphodon named Zed was following me and Terry. Unfortunately, Zed fell behind, and I forgot he was there. I landed Terry safely, lined up my jump, and leapt back the way we'd come. My chute popped perfectly, and my glide was going to be LONG. Then Zed caught up, flew straight at me, and fouled the lines of my chute.\n \nI dropped fast. Not killed-by-the-fall fast, but definitely short-of-my-goal-by-80% fast. I landed in a boulder-filled vale just to the west of the platform. The vale's only other major feature besides boulders was hungry carnivores. I emptied my shotgun into a 'raptor, then finished it off with a pike only to discover that a carnotaur had stopped quarreling with a pair of sabertooths, and was charging me.\n \nCarnos charge in straight lines, and turn poorly. I used the terrain to my advantage, and attempted to lead him back into his sabertoothed foes. It worked perfectly, except for the part where they decided to share a meal. I now had three carnivores chasing me.  I almost ran headlong into another sabertooth, but it leaped and I ducked, and then I kept running.\n \n\"Keliana, where are you?\"\n \n\"North of that purple light. There's a cliff between me and you. You'll need to go around it.\"\n \nI turned and checked to see how close pursuit was.\n \nI screamed.\n \nThe game does a really good job of getting predators right. They don't roar or screech unless they're fighting. They come at you teeth-first, and quietly.\n \nI had a perfect view of three sabertooths, one carnotaur, and behind them, just starting to take interest, a pair of tyrannosaurs who I may have run a bit too close to without noticing them.\n \n\"THERE IS NO AROUND!\"\n \nThe nice thing about video-game cliffs is that if they're not sheer, sometimes you can cheat them, running sideways and down, and landing without having broken your bones. I did this, knowing that my pursuit could do the same thing.\n \nI splashed through shallows at the base of the cliffs, and then saw that I was being charged from the front by a velociraptor. It was over.\n \nThen I saw that the velociraptor had a saddle on it, and there was a woman in the saddle.\n \n\"I've got you, Dad!\"\n \nShe and the mob swept past me. I missed what happened next, because it happened behind me. I did get game alerts telling me that my tribe's pets were killing things, but they went by too fast for me to count. I saw exactly zero flashing red alerts, which meant that Keliana had killed everything chasing me without taking any casualties.\n \nThat's my girl.\n \nAre we playing this game the way it was meant to be played?

Players from foreign countries harass servers constantly and block off resources/wyvern egg spawn etc. So they can farm them and sell them for money on websites, again I have seen them do nothing about this. \n\nYou will get stuck... allot and have no way to kill yourself or get out because you are stuck in free fall until you starve to death.\n\nMy friend couldn't play because his game literally would crash every 5 minutes. My game upon loading up and trying to join a server forces itself to restart each time, the restarted client will then actually join the server.\n\nThis game is great fun. But there are so many glitches and they allow so many people to abuse game mechanics on \"official\" servers. If you submit a ticket because any issue good luck on getting a response, good luck on actually completing the ticket even as it is made difficult even to request help. \n\nGreat concept, and fun game but them allowing people to violate their code of conduct and not fixing the issues is tiresome.", "timestamp_created": 1527195883, "timestamp_updated": 1527195883, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 492, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.850295007228851318", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33316933": {"recommendationid": "33316933", "author": {"steamid": "76561198034052250", "num_games_owned": 525, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 3177, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542572082}, "language": "english", "review": "Price is higher than FPS.", "timestamp_created": 1499359256, "timestamp_updated": 1499359256, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1934, "votes_funny": 1929, "weighted_vote_score": "0.890656530857086182", "comment_count": 85, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "44402164": {"recommendationid": "44402164", "author": {"steamid": "76561198348217296", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 9373, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1536060749}, "language": "english", "review": "A game with monumental potential but is plagued with many flaws. The gameplay is fantastic, the complete freedom is refreshing and unique. You can have hours & hours of fun in this massive open world with so many ways to play the game. \n\nHowever, the official servers are a joke, not just in how they run, but the pvp gameplay promotes a toxicity amongst the community, tribes are forced to be more aggressive and cautious because they can lose so much if they are raided by other players. This is where the problems start. Smaller, casual tribes struggle to get to a position to enjoy a PvP server as they get wiped by Tribes with thousands of hours of grinding gameplay. At end game, tribes start going to the extremes trying to DdoS servers, duplicate items, slot cap servers all to get this extra edge and quite literally destroy the game for everyone else. The game is so dependant on the grind, that you can't stop playing without understanding that if you log on in a week you, your base & your dinos will be gone. \n\nTrying to find a place to build on PvE servers where someone hasn't made a foundation & pillar to not allow you build around there is annoying. Then once you finally start building on one of these PvE official servers and try and tame your first dino, it won't let you because the server is dino capped! I know there are some fantastic unofficial servers out there, but do I really want to invest all my time into a server that can be turned off, changed or wiped? \n\n- I would love to see a auto toggle PvE - PvP feature. Just to give enough time for new players and casuals to get on their feet, understand essential game mechanics and will auto toggle when your tribes resources, dinos and members reach a certain point\n- New servers that have tribe based Dino & resource caps, might promote a different style of strategic and skill based gameplay. A casual, faster paced experience with less investment might bring in new players and provide variety to the normal ark game modes.\n- Something has to be done about people placing random structures all over the place in PVE so no one can build remotely close to them. I have seen some span ridiculously far...  Perhaps making it that you can't build near anything bigger than a 3x3?

Those hours are mostly on official servers, but a lot of them are also on dedicated/private/modded servers.  With that many hours, it should be clear to anyone that I liked this game and that there must be something within it that has made me put so much time into it, right?  Right.  Kind of, at least.\n\nThe basics of the game are fantastic.  You start out incredibly weak and can become incredibly strong.  You can do this on official servers.  You can do this on dedicated and private servers.  And if you are really bored, you can do this in single player mode.  The maps are large and fun.  The gameplay is exciting.  Reaching almost any goal feels rewarding and compels you to keep going.  You never run out of things to do.  You can always farm materials, tame dinosaurs, raid a base, defend against someone raiding your base, and the list goes on and on.  This is - without a doubt - one of the most addicting games I have ever played.  But...\n\nThe truth is, I think that I convinced myself that this game was great.  It isn't.  After all of the incredibly time consuming tasks you perform in this game, so many things can - and very likely will - happen that set you back or even make you start completely over, it's ridiculous.  Let me explain.\n\nThat dino that took you hours to tame (no exaggeration here) and that somehow made it through without being attacked by another player or some random dino biting it or stomping on it as it passed by?  It came out perfect!  It's the best dino you have ever tamed.  It's the best dino on the server!  It's the best dino in the history of the game!  Well, it can get stuck in a wall.  It can get stuck in the ground.  It can fall through the map.  Can you get it replaced?  Nope!  Well, sort of.  You can put a ticket in for it and three(ish) weeks later, a game dev will contact you and make you set up an appointment with them to give you a replacement.  Depending on when your mutual schedules align, this can take even more time.  When it finally happens, the replacement will not be exact.  It's almost certain that whatever the replacement is will be very far from what you actually lost.  There is no \"restore\" for this.  The game dev will simply \"spawn\" in the same type of dino - up to a certain level only - and tame it for you.  The stats are random so the liklihood of you getting anything that you actually care about is very very low.  Will they keep doing it until it matches what you had before?  Nope.  They do it once then they are done and then they are gone, ignoring anything that you say to them as they float, naked, up and away from you.  Good thing you waited weeks for that, right?\n\nHow about that character that you created and leveled for countless hours.  You beat end game bosses, unlocking the best engrams/skills in the game.  You gained extra levels above the soft level cap for it.  Well, somehow it got lost/corrupted/deleted by something outside of your control.  No worries.  That can be restored by submitting a ticket, right?  Well - no.  Very similar to the situation explained above, they cannot simply restore your character.  They will only have you create a new character and level it up to the soft cap for you.  You don't get your boss kills.  You don't get your engrams/skills unlocked.  You don't get those ascended levels back.  You get to go do all of that again.  Too bad for you!  At least they make a funny noise while floating away again.  That's hilarious!\n\nDid you find a video of a cool place to build?  Did you go from server to server and look for a that same place only to find it built in and then finally get to one server where it was open?  Nice!  Well, after all the time you put into that, guess what.  You can log in one day and every single thing is gone.  You didn't get raided.  There is nothing in your tribe log showing that anything was destroyed or killed.  It's just all gone.  Everything.  Every dino, every floor, every door, every item.  Poof.  Well, it just so happens that a dev can simply come into the server and delete every single thing that your tribe has.  Dinos, structures, items.  All of it.  They don't give you a warning.  They don't even give you an explanation.  You just log in and it's all gone and you have to question everyone on the server as to what happened.  When you do finally see someone else getting an \"explanation\" of what happened, the dev simply states that the being able to build in that area is \"unintended\" and is considered to be the same thing as undermeshing (building or going inside of the terrain).  Not undermeshing, but considered to be the same thing?  Oh, so there must be a list of places that building is not acceptable, right?  Nope.  You get to figure that out on your own.  Wahooooo!  \n\nDo you like lag?  Well, you're in luck.  This game is one of the most lag-ridden games I have ever played.  Can they fix it?  Who knows!  It's been years and it's still there - taunting you at the best times.  Like when you are shooting at a dino or at another player.  When you are just about to use a parachute.  When you dive that Griffin down into the scar to get some speed so that you can get away with that 190 Wyvern egg that you just stole.  Uh oh! - lag spike!  You missed that last shot on the dino or player and got killed instead.  Your parachute didn't deploy and you smashed into the ground.  Your Griffin didn't get the memo that you looked upwards to get away and instead, it flew straight into the lava - instantly killing you and the Griffin and destroying your gear and that 190 Wyvern egg.  Too bad, the lag is just part of the game! LOLOL!  Weeeeeeee!\n\nDid your base get raided by someone that DID actualy undermesh to do it while you were offline?  Guess you didn't record that, then right?  Well, too bad for you and hooray for them being able to take all of your stuff and keep it!  HAHA!  GOTTEM!\n\n\nSo many times, I saw things like these happen to others and thought \"Wow, I don't have those issues\".  Well, eventually your luck runs out.  I've had every one of those things - and others - happen and I have screenshots and ticket dialogue that show all of it.\n\nI love(ed) this game.  I think anyone that plays it would likely agree that it's one of the best games they have played - until you are the victim of any number of the issues that they don't fix or that Wildcard Studios unfairly does to it's loyal players. \n\nIt is incredibly unfortunate that this game is the best in the genre (in my opinion) and has nothing to really compete with it.  Because of this, it seems that there is nothing that drives Wildcard Studios to fix the plethora of issues within the game.  There are so many, it's ridiculous.  There is nothing stopping their game devs from abusing their power and deleting everything you have done with no warning or explanation.  They don't back up your data at all.  Restores for anything are impossible.  What kind of business is this?  Instead of Wildcard Studios releasing more content with the same issues or instead of re-skinning dinos or making new colors available, they should try fixing some - or even one - of the issues, instead.\n\nI used to tell everyone looking for a game to play to buy this one.  That was selfish of me.  To all of those that I wronged, I apologize.  If you haven't bought this already - I would say don't waste your time/money.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nA Teamer", "timestamp_created": 1538677396, "timestamp_updated": 1538783867, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 551, "votes_funny": 89, "weighted_vote_score": "0.86657106876373291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42706349": {"recommendationid": "42706349", "author": {"steamid": "76561198401571230", "num_games_owned": 12, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 15084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544287073}, "language": "english", "review": "Awesome game, as long as you have friends to play with.

When I get on one of my nice, casual, single-player worlds, I have a great time. However, can I recommend it? Absolutely not it the state it's in now.\n\nIn the beginning, ARK was an really good game for Early Access in my honest opinion. Sure, it had a bunch of bugs and an incredibly agrivating building system, but it was fine to accept for an early access title. Tons of people played it and tons of people loved it, including myself, even though I was pretty much somehow playing it on a potato with a few blinking lights and USB ports. Even though most times I didn't have the mental strength to play it, when I did, I had a swell time.\n\nThen came Scorched Earth.\n\nThe Scorched Earth DLC pack, a DLC pack that was for a game still in Early Access, mind you, whilst being an OK DLC pack, marked the beginning of the end. It added new dinosaurs and a new map that many, also including myself, thought should've have merely been an update to the game. It also proved to many people that, instead of working on the many, many bugs and even the building system (which was still laughably bad, by the way), they were working on more content that merely added more bugs to the pool of already existing ones. Obviously, ARK lost a lot of followers and support.\n\nBetween the point in which Scorched Earth was released and the free DLC, Ragnarok, was announced, time marched on as if Scorched Earth never even existed. No further support was given to it whilst Studio Wildcard added in new, vanilla dinosaurs. The only bit of major support SE was ever given was the addition of the Pheonix, which, at that point, couldn't coax players back onto the map in order to get it. Players had already done what Wildcard seemingly wanted them to do; they moved on.\n\nRagnarok was released and people were fairly pleased. The map was interesting and new and was used for a long while. Granted, it was a fan created map, and there are some incredibly tallented map creators for ARK out there, but it was something new for everyone that played on consoles that couldn't use user created content (yes, ARK was released on consoles in this stage). However, even with the new map that added the Griffin, many things still weren't fixed, most importantly the building system that had gone years without repair. Everyone that could play on PC weren't adversly effected with the mod Structures+, but every player on console were having to suffer the ugly pillars that poked through the ceilings, the glitches in which a structure would snap to a point that wasn't even accessable, and the fact that if the surface you were building on wasn't perfectly straight, you were sh!t out o' luck. However, even then, they still held hope; Studio WC announced that they were planning on integrating S+ into the base game, and everyone erupted in glee.\n\nAnd then, sh!t hit the fan.\n\nWhilst Abberation was still under development, the STILL Early Access title was raised from the previous $29.99 to the wopping $59.99 it is now. Fans erupted with outrage, seeing that the title that was 75% completed at best was raised to the price of a full AAA game. At this point, ARK started rolling down hill at the velocity of a bullet train as SWC rushed the game to \"completion,\" leaving many of the bugs that had been there since day one in the game and declaring it a finished product when Abberation finally launched to the public. It was at this point, and the point we're still at today, in which ARK reached the lowest point of its lifetime, a point thought unreachable when it was first put into EA. Server preformance was garbage, S+ had never been implemented into the base game, the game was an unoptimized piece of rotten fruit that required the entire bulk of a well preforming gaming PC, the server browser was a complete joke, and there was NO WAY that ARK should've been released in the state that it was.\n\nAnd now, here we sit, with yet another game fed to the dogs that sh!t money. Was the game ever ready for release? No, my friend, no it wasn't. Now, we have a game that is STILL 75% completed at best selling for the price of a AAA title with a basic carbon copy dipped in glitter glue selling on the Steam storefront for half the price. Am I angry? Yes. Am I devastated? Also yes. I'm angry and sad that this can happen so easily to good games in EA, but, hey, it's Early Access. What you buy is never what you can expect years into the future. Fate, no, some developers in general, are cruel and choose making money over making a quality product that people can enjoy years after we've long passed on. I won't refund my copy, too late to now. However, what I can do is warn everyone. DO NOT BUY ARK IN THIS STATE! Do not give Studio Wildcard more money for this beaten and broken game! If everything changes, I'll change this reveiw as well, but for right now, even with how hard it may be to...\n\nAVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE BLACK DEATH IN EUROPE OF 1350!", "timestamp_created": 1525388034, "timestamp_updated": 1525388034, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 780, "votes_funny": 42, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863424062728881836", "comment_count": 53, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31382994": {"recommendationid": "31382994", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051260626", "num_games_owned": 13, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 153169, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1540655363}, "language": "english", "review": "OK, I previously reviewed this before they announced an actual launch date.  I still stand by my initial review.  We played for over a year on an incredible community server.  There was still PVP but it wasn't what the PVP has turned into.  You want these big wars they advertise with you riding armies across fields to PVP.  Keep looking for a different game because you will never see that in this game.  We initially had uninstalled due to how toxic the player base got after cross server transfers.  We saw the new Isolated servers and thought wow, finally a way for people to enjoy the game.  My husband played for a day on one server before being trolled and losing everything while offline.  He started over on a new server and I joined him because everyone he was running into wasn't about just ruining his game. A few hours later we had a small house and a few riding tames.  I had just placed a feeding trough finally and was heading to my house to park and log off.  All of the sudden a guy on a raptor and a guy on a frog show up trying to kill me, so I get away becuase obviously after a few hours we have no defenses so I run. They proceed to blow a hole in the building I come back to ask why to which they then just keep me unconcious while they dump, not take my things just dump on the ground our entire morning of work.  Player base in this game is toxic, you can't enjoy it, you can't build, you can't tame because someone will just come along in a few hours and destroy it all again.  I stick with my initial review.  Do not waste your money!  Game is still super laggy, even on extremely low memory it overheats our pc's Some parts of maps are so glitchy you can barely make it through them.  It had the potential to be a great game but the humans playing it ruin any fun anyone gets. There is no need to attack people that have only played a few hours, have no turrets, live in stone and don't even have a dino that can eat other dinos.  That is just being a dick.  That is what this game is full of.  If no one lets anyone build you can never have true PVP because OP players picking on new players is not PVP.  Add to that the fact that for the most part developers didn't listen to any of us when they made changes that affected gameplay, I mean why would you listen to the player base, what would they know about how your game actually plays.  Now a once awesome game was destroyed from the inside out.  Bad decision after bad decision and now they try to \"fix\" what they broke but the players are entirely too toxic to fix.  Players have found every way possible to exploit the game and find new ways to every day.  Maybe it's not just this game maybe it's just a sign of society in general.  I have noticed a change in the gamers out there no empathy, they cheat whenever they can, it's all me, me, me with most of them.  Time to go back to the way life used to be actually interracting with humans so you can actually see the pain in someone when you crush their soul.  Maybe it wouldn't be as easy to be such nasty cheating trolls in every game.  What's the point of a PVP game if you never let anyone build so they are actually a fight?  Oh I guess you aren't good enough to actually PVP so just keep trolling we'll go elsewhere and tell our friends not bother.  I was in an alpha for over a year, we intentinally let people build huge dfended bases so that we actually had a fight.

Find a few other noobs and make a family together. Working hard and proud on our home, we ventured through our island chopping down trees, and killing what we could. Then the server wiped.

There is ALWAYS something new. I have played since day 1 (sometimes not very well ;) ) and I can say that this game has changed tremendously, overall for the good. Everything that is an issue is handled either by the Devs, Mod Creators or by Server Owners.\n\nPros:\n*Being a server owner I look into all of the complaints and tweak the game to my player base liking. \n*This game has everything you could want out of an MMO. \n*Explorer notes to delve into the story-line\n*You can Roleplay\n*Grind out materials \n*Build to your hearts content \n*Tame hundreds of beautiful DINOSAURS <3\n*Play solo \n*Play with large groups\n*Constant updates and events\n*Private servers have actual communities, player bases and privately hosted events\n*Endless game-play on hundreds of different servers with different play styles. -- Re-playability, 100% -- \n*Any negative review you see can be handled by a personal server owner and should not be held negatively against the game. (Yeah i'm pretty sure i've read 90% of them over the years)\n*People of ALL AGES play. This is not just a \"child\" or \"old person\"'s game. I literally have players on my server from age 9 to 70.\n*Graphics quality - You might need a great computer to get full potential, but still gorgeous with lesser computers\n*Price/quality - Worth the Price if you can find a COMMUNITY. Solo playing is just as fun, but being in a tribe can really immerse you more and give you a sense of purpose in the game.\n*Difficulty - Depends on the SERVER. There are very many insanely easy and insanely difficult servers, you CAN find what suits you <3\n*Game Length - Endless <3\n*Story Line - Maybe difficult to follow unless you're the \"questing\" type, there are websites for this though.\n*Weather System\n*Crafting System - Engrams\n*People from ALL COUNTRIES can play this game with stability (Server Dependent) \n*Can play PVE or PVP or BOTH! - at the same time! -See Community Servers <3\n\nMiddle Ground:\nI have seen Ark literally become people's escape / 2nd life. This game is very immersive!!\n\nCons:\n*Sometimes it becomes people's second life\n*OFFICIAL SERVERS - These communities are not welcoming, and are normally dominated by one group over several hundred servers, normally you can not even play due to Omega tribes, and if you are GRANTED the right to play, you will be a \"farm bitch\" for several hundred hours to prove yourself before you can do ANYTHING else. Official Servers are Toxic and make several thousand people quit monthly.\n*Random glitches depending on the maps (Bugs occasionally)\n*Graphics quality - You might need a great computer to get full potential, but still gorgeous with lesser computers\n*Story Line - Maybe difficult to follow unless you're the \"questing\" type, there are websites for this though.\n\nI would HIGHLY recommend this game, over and over. I even have customers (in my salon) I tell on a daily basis and give them the info for my servers and they become addicted quickly! This game is near perfection. Don't get me wrong, it has its faults, but the Pros far out-weigh the Cons!!!!\n\nIf anyone has any questions about anything not mentioned feel free to message me on steam!!", "timestamp_created": 1529985414, "timestamp_updated": 1529985414, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 216, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.891965031623840332", "comment_count": 38, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16194620": {"recommendationid": "16194620", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008753200", "num_games_owned": 5171, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 2958, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1513263108}, "language": "english", "review": "This is one of the best survival games I have ever played and it's only in early access right now. There is already a ton of content and the game looks beautiful. There are a few bugs here and there and the game still needs to be optimized for better performance (Devs said this is in progress already) but right out of the gates, this game is amazing.\n\nThere currently is no tutorial for what to do or how to progress but it's a survival game so it's fun to learn the hard way, especially when the hard way means getting your body gnawed on by dinosaurs. When you first join the game you are welcomed by a character creation screen. You can choose either Male or Female and then customize your look. The customization is a little sparse at the moment with some awkward scale adjustments for the body. After fiddling around with it for a while, I just ended up going with something very close to the default look.\n\nOnce you create your character and choose one of 4 general areas to spawn (North/South/East/West) you find yourself waking up on a beach and scratching your arm that has some weird implant in it. This implant seems to be the key to how you manage your inventory, crafting, and leveling up. The first thing you will notice when you start on your beach is just how good this game looks and it is truly beautiful. The sun is beating down onto the beach where the water meets the sand. The trees in the richly detailed forest sway in the wind and the grass and foliage cover the landscape before you. So much vibrant life all around you and then you see the dinosaurs. \n\nThe dinosaurs are very detailed and bring a since of awe to the game just like the first scene you see in Jurassic Park. Luckily you see mostly herbivores but do be careful because there are some small carnivores you can run into on the beach as well. It seems that the most dangerous wildlife can be found more inland. That isn\u2019t to say that these herbivores are pushovers. That triceratops or giant turtle will most likely kill at this point in the game, so don\u2019t attack them just yet. \n\nYou begin your hard life of survival punching some trees and picking up rocks until you can craft your first pickaxe and move on from there. You can collect berries and fibers from the plant life, bash giant boulders to smithereens, and chop down any tree. You will need all of these materials to craft better items, starting with some clothes to cover up your nakedness.  \n\nThis brings us to experience. You gain experience throughout the game from doing any action. Collecting materials, crafting, and combat all add to your experience pool. If you are in a tribe you gain bonus xp from your tribe mates. Once you level up you get to choose one stat to increase permanently (health, stamina, attack, weight, etc\u2026) and then you earn some engram points to use towards learning new items to craft. The more you level, the stronger you get and the more you learn to craft. So far this is the only way to learn recipes for crafting.\n\nThis is a survival game as well so you have to keep an eye on your overall health. You can\u2019t let yourself get too hot or cold, clothes, fire, and water help with this. You can\u2019t let yourself starve so you need to forage for berries and hunt the wildlife. With eating comes defecating so make yourself regularly take a dump or your character will just act like a horse and take it anywhere they please. Actions require stamina and your character will tire if the stamina is depleted. You need to stay hydrated as well so go dunk your head in some water or craft a flask. If you take an excessive blow or fall from too high you will break a bone and walk at a snail\u2019s pace so do be careful.\n\nYou can hunt the dinosaurs in this game but you can also tame and even ride some of them. This process can be long depending on the dinosaur you wish to tame so be prepared before you do so. You basically either punch or shoot them with sling shots/arrows until they get knocked unconscious. Once unconscious you need to load them up with their respective food type (berries for herbivores, meat for carnivores). Make sure you have narco berries to feed them as well so that they can stay under for the entire time it takes. Some dinosaurs take a single in game day to tame while others can take multiple days. It is always easier to tame a dinosaur with a group of friends. If you have learned the ability to craft that dinos saddle, then you can also ride them to your heart\u2019s content.\n\nThis also brings us to the multiplayer interaction. This is a survival game so banding together with others increases your odds of survival. You also have to be weary of those who don\u2019t have your welfare in mind and are only looking out for themselves. If you can band together you can create your own tribal town with dino protectors and likeminded players. This will also protect you from those looking to do harm. When you log out of the game your character goes to sleep and is vulnerable. If you have friends and tamed dinos, this makes it safer to log out when you are done. \n\nThere is so much to this game and it is only in early access. The devs have promised a plethora of more content to come and I am looking forward to all of it. For now I will try and do my best to survive this harsh world.

I would make gains in the daytime and by night my stuff would be attacked.\nI stayed up at odd hours to defend my property, eventually I was ground down and killed.\nI went through 4 public PVP servers when the chinese invasion first hit. lost several tribes of good people who one by one fell apart under the pressure to keep things running.\n\nIn that respect I feel the developers failed me as a player. they took a hands off approach and forever scarred my experience of the game.\n\nNow my views on the game irrespective of social and dev issues:\n\nPro's: \nthe game looks beautiful\ngameplay is tight\nsounds are good\nAI is acceptable mostly\nlots and lots of stuff to do\nPVP and PVE\nCustom servers\nMOOOODS!\n\nCon's:\npublic servers are really bad and not administered\nThere is no offline protection\nThere is limited enjoyment to be had from PVE as 3/4 of stuff is pvp oriented\nthe game is a huge time sink\n\n\nNow, the number one Issue i have is that, the  game caters to players who play all the time, like anyone who is a 3hr per day type person simply cannot play PVP or enjoy it. and if they do usually its on the backs of a group of people who play 11hr+ a day keeping things running and protected.\nThis one single issue, is why the game annoys me, without offline protection, the game puts too much pressure on smaller groups forcing them to join larger groups simply to have any fun at all. this wieghting towards larger tribes basically destroys any aspirations of long term play for any group.\n\nLife cycle within the game is basically.  tribes get bigger and bigger, biggest tribe rules and kills anyone who annoys them, and eventually starts killing people because they can, around that time, they usually force many smaller tribes out of the server and then eventually they break up and leave.\n\nsomeone fills the power gap and it starts all over again.\n\nThat being said, the game is fun, and rewarding, you can make great friends and have alot of fun. you can also subject yourself to sleepless nights. worry and lose friends over it. so its your choice how you play the game, but play it to have fun.\n\n\n\n====== Post Transfers Review==========\nSo, the developers reactivated transfering characters and dinos across servers, originally i was not a fan of this severely broken mechanic, but its grown on me over the past several months of play.\nIt seems to have had the effect of making tribes get even bigger to keep thier servers safe from outsiders. but in the end, if someone comes to a server to wipe it. its being wiped no matter how much stuff you have or people you have. because you do not know its comming until its too late.\n\nTheres definately some kinks to work out in the transfer system to allow defenders a better chance at protecting themselves from offline raids and across server invasions.\nthe number of servers being wiped is steadily increasing as more and more tribes push out to attack old enemies.\n\nLooking forwards to see how the developers change the transfer mechanic once they see how its being used.\n\n\n===========Post Being part of a Baddass multi server alpha tribe===============\nSo its been a few more months since transfers got activated, since then I became part of my servers alpha tribe, joined a multi server coalition of tribes for mutual defence.\nFought off multiple tribes run by some of the biggest twitch and youtube streamers on ark official servers and generally had a bunch of fun finally getting back at some of those tribes who attacked me long ago.\n\nIs ark still interesting to me?  yes and no.  while I enjoy the pvp elements of the game more and more, I no longer get a chance to just have some fun taming a dino or going out to craft and build things.\n\nYou see once your tribe becomes truely huge, you just have too many bases to maintain or build, you have too many dinosaurs to look after and you have too many demands on your time from raising baby dinos to farming bullets and fuel and fertalizer to keep your defences running.\n\nThe ark developers recently made certain resources be consumed faster so base maintinence is more annoying than it was. and with the impending release of the game, there are still many issues I have with the game that I would have expected to be fixed before release.\nso Im taking a break for a while, maby after release ill do another review, hopefully things are sorted by then.\n\n\n====================================== early post release review=======\nLooks like many of the anti dupe protections now work, new servers, ect is cool.\n\nbut... within a day everyone who was abandoned on the \"legacy servers\" came over to the new ones and took over every server which means alllll the new players basically got slaughtered and will have no chance to get anywhere thanks to power levelling.\nsooo... i dont know... same game as before. doesnt feel released.", "timestamp_created": 1455638997, "timestamp_updated": 1504187517, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 358, "votes_funny": 76, "weighted_vote_score": "0.870532870292663574", "comment_count": 53, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28155831": {"recommendationid": "28155831", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071309414", "num_games_owned": 49, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 232166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1542432514}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes, I recommend this game if you play on a private server or solo game.

With the re-instated server tansfer capabilities, it has gotten to the point where the game is unplayable and simply not fun. People blocking resources and not allying up is very problematic as well. Then if the invaders do take over various resources you and your tribe are hosed. The game is not balanced well for PVP, especially if the invaders have taken over other public servers, mining resources there and then transfering into your server. We've attempted blocking all the Obies and all the drops as to deter them and at the least trap them here. Unfortunately, that breaks the game play even more. \n\nWithin the discussions, there are a lot of complaints about these invaders from across the Pacific. These discussions often times are \"locked\" from replies and or are deleted in order to minimize the exposure of the problem rather than providing an answer for the problem. One answer would be to follow in the steps of other studios, where these particular group of people only have access to servers listed for their country/region. I do hope this issue becomes resolved one way or another. It is sad that such a great game can be ruined by social behaviors. Unfortunately, the culture of certain countries do not view cheating as a bad thing. In fact they view it as \"a win is a win, no matter how it's achieved\".", "timestamp_created": 1480754417, "timestamp_updated": 1480754417, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1547, "votes_funny": 66, "weighted_vote_score": "0.857782840728759766", "comment_count": 140, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "23592339": {"recommendationid": "23592339", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089380514", "num_games_owned": 47, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 74775, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543778557}, "language": "english", "review": "Well I have put in over 1,000 hours into this game so I don't need to tell you that I enjoyed the game, but I will anyway.\n\nBefore I dive into the actual game I want to talk cons. \nThis game requires fairly constant attention if you play with other people. On Lan servers/Solo play this is not as much of an issue, but there are timers on a lot of things that will reset if you don't play often enough. Buildings will be able to be destroyed/auto demolished after a certain number of days. After a set number of days pets will become claimable (this allows other players to take your pets before they starve to death), and then if left unclaimed they will starve to death. If you don't have time and/or a lot of friends to play with it may be hard to keep up with the timers. Thatch houses give you 3 days, Wood gives about 7. pets are usually claimable at the time that wood buildings are allowed to be demoed (PVE) without attacking (PVP). On Private servers/solo play these can be turned off and some are automatically turned off, but in official servers they are unchanging. \n\nNow on to pros. \nI love how open this game is. I can do what I want, when I want, and wherever I want. If I want to build a castle on top of a mountian I can do just that. If I want to tame a T-Rex, or Quetzalcoatlus (giant flying reptile) I can simply set my sights on that and tame one. I would reccommend starting on an official PVE server and learning the ropes from the helpful sorts that tend to gather there before heading over to any PVP servers. If you start on a PVP for the first time don't be surprised if players destroy your \"loot pinata\" (house built with easy to break materials like thatch and to a much lesser degree wood) for the easy and free items they can get out of the building. \n\nKeep in mind this is a survival game. However, unlike some survival games ARK does not penalize you if you die. If you die and don't find your equipment after a while your equipment will disapear, but everything else you have built will not (unless there was a giga attacking your base camp, even then you keep all of your level ups and engrams so it is a lot faster to rebuild.) Go into this game expecting to die. If you are not dying on a regular basis before you reach level 20-30 you are either lucky or have had help. Joining a tribe can help make it easier to stay alive, but is not necessary (I got my first character to level 70 with around 100 pets before I joined my first tribe). I am now on my fourth character (I got bored of demolishing everything on the island with my pet gigas on 3 of the prior 4 and 1 of them I accidentally deleted). \n\nAlso keep in mind that this game is not yet complete. There will continue to be changes made to the game until it is officially released, so be warned that the game is not optimised (may run slow/not at all on mid cost computers), and there are going to be glitches and or things that break between now and completion. We are here testing the game to help them find game breaking bugs, so be sure to report any that occur. \n\nThere are quite a few mods for this game, and many of them are great. I would however reccomend taming all the way up to at least a T-Rex before you start to mod the game. Some of the mods take away from the over all gameplay. \n\nHope my review is helpful, and I wish any who play good luck.

Seconds later, he's killed by a woman riding a raptor and wielding an AK-47 simply for the crime of existing. While this was a wonderful cinematic that was meant to promote the game positively, it incidentally showed potential players the single WORST part of the game and the reason you should avoid it entirely.\n\nUnless you're planning on playing on a private server with friends, which will cost you at least $15 a month, you're guaranteed to only enjoy playing ARK if you get incredibly lucky. And I mean -incredibly- lucky. You may even find better luck on public servers if you have a friend who's got 5,000+ hours in game and can supply you with everything to get started. I've tried no less than 24 times to start fresh on public servers, and here's just a sampling of the things that've happened to me:\n\n- Chased down by a three men riding Tyrannosaurs because I tried harvesting fiber on \"their beach\"\n- Tranquilized with a scoped rifle, handcuffed, siphoned for my blood and left on a raft floating in the middle of the ocean\n- Tamed my first dinosaur, logged off for a grand total of an hour and logged back in to find both my beloved parasaur and everything I'd made from cloth and wood stolen, burned to the ground, etc.\n- Tranq'd (again) after I logged on, regained consciousness only to find my inventory stuffed with dinosaur poop.\n- Had my entire box of berries and (albeit stolen) eggs raided and replaced with large dinosaur poop.\n- Finally, and I mean FINALLY got to the point where I'd made a friend and we'd built a small base together near a waterfall off of the tundra. Left for maybe 10 minutes to tame some pterosaurs so we could fly, and returned to find the server admin astride a massive bronto smashing everything we owned because \"it was his waterfall\"\n\nThe community is toxic, the game actively punishes you for logging off, and no matter how much progress you make you'll NEVER be guaranteed anything besides a swift and unjust end. Think you can lock your base's door and log off inside to be safe? Wrong again. Someone will just bust down the wall and drag your ass outside to execute you for the crime of not playing the game 24 hours a day. \n\nI had fun ONLY when I was on a private server with friends and we took the time solely to have fun and build massive cities in the wildnerness. The game HAS potential, but even now it's just sadistic garbage that punishes people for trying to play the game without some kind of helping hand on their side long before they start playing.\n\nEither get a friend who's lost his job because of all his ARK hours, or get your own server and never deal with the community at large.

Its a big socilogical experiment and we are the Guinea Pigs. Most of the time this game is so much fun, but then some jerk does the equivalent of Home Invasion in real life and ruins everything. They scream and shout about PvP and so on. PvP is garbage in this game. Tribe Warfare and PvP when you and your oponent are on even ground is fun. Being lvl 65 or 100 depending what you play on, and running around picking up and dropping new spawns isnt pvp, thats pretty much just going to the newborn ward at the local hospital and punching babies. Mostly its high level people and large Tribes wiping out smaller ones for some weird reason.  Alot of the interactions that go on in game are mostly people whom are very \"small\" in real life, who are a bit to big for their britches in game. (Yeah I said Britches,,whats up ?)   One of my first encounters with the lower lifeforms in this game was as I was taming a dino with  some tribe members, two people came up to us and accused us of stealing something. We didnt, and we told them that. They decided anyways to Tranq me and when I dare voice my displeasure over it, the female aggressor killed me, and said that I should be nice..... I called her a scumbag.  Oh well life goes on.\nAnyways whole point being this game will pretty much let you live out your sociopathic fantasys of murdering people for nothing, and more than likely be stabbed to death in a dark jungle by a 15 year old.  Mostly this game is just an excuse to act crappy toward people with no reprocussions.\n\nBUT :PvP can be great when things are relativly fair.

When you spend hundreds of hours farming a base and taming dinos, be prepared to spend hundreds of hours maintaining that, because if you aren't constantly growing your defenses and and watching all your assets, a zerg tribe from some far off country and server will come and wipe everything you had, and not even feel a little bad about it.

Boom.\n\nJustice.\n\n10/10 Would justice again.\n\nIn all seriousness, the Official servers lack clear rules and administration. Do yourself a favor, find a good unofficial server, and the game will be loads better. No hacking, no cheaters, no lag, no rubberbanding, etc. You'll also find a better community on these servers, which is part of the fun in a game like this. \n\nAs for leveling, it's quite easy, as everything you do that requires input from yourself except taming, gives you exp from 1 to 67, which is current max level. Hence, you don't have to move on to a new area, like some other games on the market. \n\nThe game is harsh, however, and it does not go easy on you. If your T-rex dies, that you just spent 7 hours taming, it's dead. There's no way to bring it back, or rez it, or take backs. If you get overly attached to the things you tame, play PVE. You'll have a much more fun time, because if you play PVP, you may just log in naked on the beach with everything you own destroyed. Again, play on an unofficial with rules that you agree with. Some unofficials don't allow base leveling, or killing of passive dino's, etc. \n\nYou'll want to find a tribe, because the more people you have working on a base, the stronger it will be, and the less time it will take building it. Once you get to metal tier, the sheer amount of stones you need to make a small metal building will be astonishing, so you need to work with others to accomplish goals that are out of a single players reach. \n\nIf you play on a PVP server, know that at some point, you will wake up dead. It's only a matter of time before this happens. Expect it, and have a backup plan. IE: A small hidden home, preferrably metal, with supplies for retaming, rearming, retooling, etc., so that you don't have to start from a stone axe again. \n\nOverall, it's an excellent experience, as long as you are OK with an EA title. You'll find bugs that will screw you over and cause you to lose tons of your time, but that's par for the course at this stage of development. \n\nThere is no other survival game on the market that comes close to Ark at the moment. My playtime attests to that fact. \n\nIf you pick it up, good luck on the isle! If you have questions, stop by my stream and ask away.

I've seen the good, and the bad, and the what the hell.  I've seen the angry folks who can't forgive any misstep, the people who bend over backwards to defend the developer, and everyone in between that just wants to play the damned game.  It's hard to talk about the game without talking about the development cycle so here's the preamble: This was an Early Access game.  It had a checkered past of being filled chock full of bugs (falling through the map when logged out, for example), running at least a year longer in development time than intended, and putting out a paid DLC expansion while still in development.  These are all things that have happened.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, yes, I recommend ARK.  With caveats.  \n\nQuite a few, actually.\n\nYou see, what first got me here, and might be getting you here, is the notion of taming dinosaurs.  And let me tell you, I still love riding a rex and eating things.  I love having a grouping of dinos that are just . . . mine.  I grew up loving dinosaurs.  I still love them.  What kept me here is that plus building.  I love building.  It's fun to make things, giant things, pretty things, fantastic things. But, what enables these things in a way that makes them enjoyable are (A) mods.  Lots of mods.  (B) an unofficial server (C) reasonable people to play with, regardless of PvE or PvP.\n\nLet's hit up the main game experience first.  You load into your chosen world, and are prompted to create your version of a dude or a lady, then, when finished, you spawn in, naked but for some undies laying somewhere on a beach or the jungle.  And then, almost immediately after, you are eaten.  You may or may not even see your attacker.  You spawn again.  This time, you get a good look around (and almost assuredly turn down your graphical settings; the game has been optimized but it's still overly demanding) and you get to see the raptor running at you before being attacked by the rest of the raptors following that one, and boom, dead again.  You spawn in a third time and, assuming you aren't on a PvP server where griefers reign, you will live.  You see a few wandering creatures, and you start picking berries from bushes so you don't starve.  Hitting trees for thatch. Picking up stones from the ground.  Now you have a stone pick, a building plan you start with, and you can start to harvest rocks.  And then a dilophosaurus spits on you, blinding you while it eats you.  You spawn in again, and once again are naked and tool-less.  You can now choose: run to your corpse to retrieve your belongings, or start anew.  Here's what you'll keep if you die: your experience, and your \u201cengrams\u201d building plans that you have personally memorized.  Anything and everything else can be lost.  Dinosaurs, buildings, items, anything.  If you're on PvP, the you ARE setting yourself up for potentially losing hours to days to even months of work in the possible blink of an eye.  On PvE, you only lose the items on you when you die, your dinosaurs to other dinosaurs, or structures to rampaging beasts that detect you or a tamed dino, which they apparently find super interesting and immediately tasty, and they will chew through your house to get to the meaty treat inside.  That means a sufficient wall will keep those out.  There are ways to safeguard, but the potential for loss is always there.\n\nNow, on to the points. There are free official map \u201cmods\u201d, and the best of those, visually, is one called Ragnarok.  The original Island is fine for starting out on, but Ragnarok has a bit of everything, including a smattering of most of the things from Scorched Earth, the DLC expansion they released during development.  There are also building and decoration mods, Structures + being the most well known, so well known that Wildcard themselves have decided to implement features of that mod into the base game; it includes a variety of quality of life features that allow for easier building as well as automation of some of the more tedious farming and upkeep requirements.  There are decorative mods, the most robust being eco's series of mods.  There is a rather in depth building mod for medieval style building called Castles, Keeps, and Forts, which allows for a different style and look over the original materials.  There's even mods to speed along the taming times by causing hunger while simultaneously delivering torpor.  If all this seems like a lot to cover, it is, at first.  You may or may not be better off trying ARK in single player to test it out vanilla first, but sooner or later, you'll want a server, because this game isn't built nor balanced for single player.\n\nWhen you pick servers, if you happen to be a masochist, I'd suggest choosing an official server, which will have default tame times and harvesting ratios and the whole thing will take you a while.  If you hate yourself, choose an offical PvP server.  Otherwise, I heartily suggest finding a friend, an acquaintance, or just picking at random and signing in to an unofficial server.  See, those servers can change taming times to be more reasonable.  There are dinosaurs that, without the super master taming food, can take upwards of 8 hours, depending on the level.  This is reasonable only if you have a tight knit group willing to take shifts to tend to the creature.  Even in PvE, a wandering meat eater of some kind can happen upon the unconscious dinosaur and ruin the tame.  It can be even harder/worse with \u201cpassive\u201d tames, where you toss it food and then wait as it wanders, possibly coming in contact with all manner of dangerous creatures.  A server with altered stats for taming, harvesting, breeding, and more is in my opinion a must for full enjoyment of the game past the mark of a week.\n\nWhich I feel leads me to the last point, if you join a server where there are griefers, PvE or PvP, you're gonna have a bad time.  PvP griefing is obvious, but even worse is the PvE griefer which builds items to block spawns, and then continues to check in so their built roadblocks don't decay.  You will need to find reasonable folks, regardless of your preferred playstyle (unless that playstyle is griefer, in which case, I dunno man).\n\nWith those three things taken care of, the game will be a wonderful experience.  2000 of those 3000 hours I've played have been on modded, changed stat maps in PvE, and it's why I've played as long as I have. \n\nAlso, as a note, though this game has offically been launched, it is still under development.  They are revamping some of their earlier creatures, putting out new DLC, and they patch it constantly. The game as-is is over 100 gigs of information on a hard drive.

The review is full of sadness and grief about a really good game.\nHello my dear friend. If you decide to start playing this game, then I want to warn you about some of the intricacies of the work of the administration and technical support of the game masters. The game has bugs and flaws. And if you are in a difficult situation, then you will have to contact support. You will receive the answer and support no earlier than in 10-14 days. Best case scenario. Wow, isn't it?\nThe saddest thing is when you lose a character. Just imagine. You've been pumping a character for months, catching dinosaurs, pumping them. They built a base, grew their own dinosaurs, achieved a print (this is a very important thing in the game that makes your dinosaurs stronger). Get up at night, grow a dinosaur for several days.\nIt is not joke! Some dinosaurs you will grow 4-5 days or more. Otherwise, you will not be able to beat the bosses in this game and fully enjoy the content of this game. And are you ready to lose it all? Everything!!! Because without a character\u2019s entry into the game, dinosaurs disappear in 6 days. The buildings are longer, but this will not help you.\nWhy is that? Because they will answer your pleas for urgent help only in 10-14 days. Very cool, right? They don't care about you as a player. Spitting on your sleepless nights, on your nerves spent in the game, on the fact that you bought the game for your money and want a normal game without bugs and quality support. They only need your MONEY!\nThey will not be able to return your favorite grown dinosaur with the necessary characteristics (this is the second very important thing in the game), which you could select for a very long time (month, half a year, year and this is not a joke). They will simply give you a dino with random stats. Ha ha ha! Thank you, very funny.\nWhen you barely go through the bosses, you will receive special cool drawings - Tek engrams (this third is a very important thing in the game). They are assigned only to the character that you play. And if you lose this character, then nobody will restore the engrams !!! the maximum that support can do is to return the level to a new character (only 104). And nothing more! No compensation for your suffering! They do not care about you as a player and person.\nI was in this situation. I was morally crushed and devastated. They simply ignore all requests and demands for compensation. And when you lose your character, you have to start almost everything. Thanks to my friends and only they helped me to recover a lot of the lost.\nThere is another funny situation. I will not be unfounded. Some of my friends played the Aberration 375 server. There are a lot of chinese players on this server. they build their buildings and interfere with the rest of the players. Other players are trying to negotiate with them and resolve the issue peacefully without contacting technical support, but the chinese players ignore them.\nBut it cost my friends to build a single building that interferes with the other players, so they began to write that they were disturbed. Friends did the same as the chinese players - did not respond to them. Then this players ran to complain in support as the most miserable people in the world. And you know what happened? Technical support responded surprisingly with lightning speed. Game master came when friends were not in the game. And not only deleted the building that interfered. He deleted everything ALL !!! Buildings, dinosaurs, even garden beds. The saddest thing is that this was all done WITHOUT WARNING! Friends played a whole year on this server.\nImagine that you give the game a whole year of your life and in an instant everything disappears. Without understanding the situation. Just because you did not like someone or prevented. Do you think this is fair? Do you think it is fair that the game master is coming and without warning everything is deleted?\nYou are not protected in this game. It is possible that after this post, someone will complain about me and they will delete me too.\nHave a good game, my friend.\n\n\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0442

good time unless you have a crew of more than 20 to outplay Alpha clans.  Even then that's a stretch as some of these alpha clans span many servers and have over 200 members.  The most broke mechanic of all is the fact that I can name myself clan blablabla and rename it FyourFace and raid you, then change it back to blablabla and you will never know who killed your tames or raided your things.  Alphas do this all the time.  Offical servers are populated by either american, asian or brazil population and once one of them becomes an alpha if you are not from that nation you are a target.  Plain and simple\n\nPlay on private, donate to private so they stay alive and stay away from offical server alphas.  they just troll and make up rules as they go.  Who's gonna stop them?\n\n\nWhy spend 365 hours playing a game when an alpha clan can end you and ban you from a server in 10 minutes?  And that means all skills all levels gone in 10 minutes because they have the numbers to report you for abuse.  So you could join another server and start fresh, and the same thing could happen again.  \n\nSo what's the problem?  Alpha clans and or large clans have nothing to do.  After they've tamed 12 Gigas and 15 Trex's and breed them to perfection stats what is there to do?  Might as well go stomping around and flex.  build metal letters in the hills that spell out clan names and kill people that want those resources for ingame stuff.  They are bored and you become their entertainment.  all your QQ and WTF's become their live streams and lolz.  \n\nI loved the game, thought it was cool, built a base and started to tame and then....  I was raided so i built smarter and better, watched videos and tuts studied and played with building offline.  And was never raided (most raiding happens by mid teir clans that rename themselves so they don't get caught.) but no...   IRON MAIDEN the alpha clan said FU when I ask them to stop picking on small 2 man clans.   I myself was a one man clan.  365 hours playing on one sever to have IRON MAIDEN an alpha clan on many different servers with 200 some members most being  brazil, come out, blow my stuff up, knock me out and  imprison me.  What am I do to?  beg? They are more equiped and established then anyone on the server combined.   No I start spamming on global F#@* IRON MAIDEN AND EVERY SERVER THEY'RE ON.  STOP.  Think about it.  You're not getting your stuff back, they're not letting you out of your cage, your only option is to die of starvation and respawn.  At which point your base is already gone and your tames and your gear and for what?  You ask them to stop picking on small clans and they grab you!  well the global spam lasted for about 10 minutes and now I can't join the server no more.\n  \nSo!  you can join an alpha clan or hope to start one and troll the hell out of that server but the moment you feel trolled and decide to troll back... Ban hammer from that server.  ALPHAS have no end game other than to fake police or monitor the server how they choose.  so this game is at the mercy of whom ever is the alpha.  And you might be thinking well that's life and that's how it's supposed to be.  Let me say this Alpha clans are not alpha clans becuase they are better at the game they are alpha because they had a head start on a server and killed off anyone and kill anyone that gets close to them in supplies and basses to eliminate threat.  Legit strat?  sure.  So again if you have a large clan and want to try and troll a server then by all means i hope you enjoy the game.  Otherwise when you start building smart large or defensive you become target number one.  \n\nSurvival is one thing first come first serve is another.\n\nYou will get wiped if large enough, strong enough and or creative enough to become a threat at low levels by either leading a gigantor to your base, doing it themselves, or renaming the clan to wipe you so that when you look at the logs you have no clue who did it.", "timestamp_created": 1467351899, "timestamp_updated": 1467855972, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 236, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.823764562606811523", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "44542225": {"recommendationid": "44542225", "author": {"steamid": "76561198123678667", "num_games_owned": 59, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 225046, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545191251}, "language": "english", "review": "After 3,500 hours, I feel it is finally time for me to write a review. \n\nFirstly, this is an amazing game with stunning visuals, the player vitals are simple and don't inhibit gameplay in a way that makes it too intrusive. The survival aspect is actually hard! It's challenging at the beginning for a new player. The first time playing the game is unlike no other game experience, so many things to do, things to tame and finding out what to use them for. Getting out of wood and going to stone feels like a valuable upgrade. Then you log off. Wake up excited to play and find out everything is destroyed. No reason, just destoyed. Even if you have nothing of value like a thatch hut, it will be destoyed. \n\nOfficial servers are toxic. They undoubtedly have a strong lead tribe known as an alpha, that undoubtedly belong to one of the two cross server alliances that are always attacking each other, might sound kinda cool, right? No. The two alliances are bad for this game. They resort to racism, slotcapping servers, hacking, and DDoSing to keep their place on their servers, they will set up botted accounts to log into a server to keep it capped so nobody can join while they're raiding. Bye Bye dinos.  Don't think the developers would do anything to help either. Jat, a member of wildcard hangs out with members of the big tribes in the alliances. He has a bias. You'll have to glitch to keep your items or keep your things alive. Did I mention the grind? Maybe you like grind, but this game has unimaginable grind. People on official servers will do 5 hour metal runs clearing every node on the server. Yes, you read that correctly, people will mindlessly grind metal for 5 real life hours. I've seen people put 200 hours in 2 weeks. Morning til night playing every day. I've seen people take vacation days from work to play this game. It's sad.\n\nThe screenshots you see do not reflect your gameplay experience, raiding people with nightvision? Nah, press tab and type in gamma 4. There you go, don't need to make night vision. More than half the dinosaurs are useless and unless you're taming them for fun I strongly suggest you play on an unofficial with rules. Otherwise kiss that all goodbye. \n\nI don't reccomend playing this game without friends. Playing solo is awful. Don't build in anything but metal, and spend 8 hours a day getting bullets for your turrets only for someone to undermesh your base (Going under the ground and popping up inside your base). Basically don't play official. \n\nI've played on both sides of the alliance, and recently they've flipped, which put a lot of my friends on the enemy side. My tribe, or the tribes I've played in have never been wiped by another tribe, so I'm not making this out of anger. I'm saying that don't spend 50+ dollars plus the DLC that you'll need to get an edge over anyone just to be dissatisfied. Play with your friends on an unofficial.

Then a little over half a year ago an expansion DLC was released, with a price tag roughly 60% of what the base game is selling for. That expansion consisted of an entirely NEW world to explore, with new dinosaurs, new technologies...basically a whole new game that just had the same engine and mostly the same rules and mechanics. And still they hide behind the Early Access program instead of admitting this game stopped being \"Early\" a long, long time ago. OK, end of rant about the absurdity of calling this an Early Access title.\n\nNow to cases. Here is what the game does well (evaluating only the base game, not the paid DLC):\n\n1. Great concept, survival plus team play plus dinosaurs. A wonderful way to start.\n2. Excellent world design, in graphics, diversity, and habitability.\n3. Very fun dinosaur taming mechanics (for the most part). \n4. Solid building mechanics, enabling everything from rude huts to massive cliffside fortresses.\n\nAll in all a nearly perfect start on creating a Game of the Century quality release. Now here is where it goes off the rails and dashes any such hopes:\n\n1. A thoroughly toxic community, with absolutely no built in measures to stop the trolls and other toxic player types from actively ruining the gaming experience for virtually everyone else, even on PVE servers. Even on servers with mostly good players, and there certainly are some of those, only a few trolls and malicious players can quickly ruin things for everyone except the long-term, well established teams that have been on the server for ages, who only hold their own by measures almost as toxic to the server at large as the creeps they are defending themselves from. New players don't have a prayer, of course. Example, all efforts to stop established players from gobbling up all the buildable land in sight have been utter failures, and one or two attempts actively made the problem much worse, so that new players can scarcely find a place to even build a campfire, let alone a shelfter from the beasties and then eventually a home. \n\n2. An update system that has an annoyingly prevalent tendency to break things, e.g. by ejecting your tamed dinos from their pens, by teleporting killer dinos inside your premises, etc. And they run updates far too often and for far too little reason. Apparently it never occurred to the devs to save up and alpha test new changes until they are both a) known to be at least as sound as the code currently running, and b) there are enough of them to bother doing an update at all. And of course premature updates then result in multiple hotfix updates to fix the problems introduced in previous updates. It is almost as bad as Microsoft Windows, where most of the bug fixes in each new update are there to fix bugs introduced in previous updates. And yet all those updates consistently FAIL to fix any of the serious bugs, some of which have been in the game since the very beginning.\n\n3. After probably hundreds of incremental updates, the devs still haven't figured out how to make solid objects....solid. Dinos get stuck inside walls. Objects and players sink through floors and often the ground beneath them, becoming stuck and/or irretrievable. Tamed dinos blink out of existence entirely, only to appear minutes to hours later in places they cannot survive more than moments, like in the middle of a swamp full of hungry wild dinos...or hundreds of feet up in midair. Ravenous wild dinosaurs pass right through even giant steel walls to feast on your tamed dinos inside. Players fall out of the sky when their flying mounts suddenly become momentarily insubstantial or when the game knocks them offline because of even the briefest interruption of one's connection to the game server, which is often the result of....\n\n4. ....crappy and highly inconsistent server performance, with very poor optimization and almost no safeguards against lag and other connection issues.\n\nPut all that together and the real problem becomes blindingly obvious: the devs are too caught up adding new content, e.g. a progression of more and more dangerous dinos, new items, harder survival modes, etc. and totally failing to finish fixing the massive flaws in the existing content to bring this game up to anything even approaching the quality level of a final release. That is why it is perpetually stuck in \"Early Access\".\n\nEdited to add one final note: I neglected to mention that the single-player of this game is actually decent, though it is still pretty gimped due to much of the content being dependent on team play to either be possible or to be enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend buying the game just for the single player mode, but thought it fair to point out that a few of the worst problems, like the toxic communities, bad server performance, and poor PvE implementation are not present in SP mode, and some others are mititaged.", "timestamp_created": 1489974465, "timestamp_updated": 1490211962, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1217, "votes_funny": 36, "weighted_vote_score": "0.866106629371643066", "comment_count": 90, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25301719": {"recommendationid": "25301719", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001063921", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 5611, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1483807320}, "language": "english", "review": "DLC berfor release.", "timestamp_created": 1472810374, "timestamp_updated": 1472810374, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 32, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.572814285755157471", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "18027635": {"recommendationid": "18027635", "author": {"steamid": "76561198210313263", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 28585, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1545224365}, "language": "english", "review": "This reveiw is for the offline singleplayer.\nI had a lot of fun with this game. \nAfter a day or so of screwing around I had a nice little house established and decided I was ready to tame dinosaurs.

The only thing you do not loose is your character (unless you left it on a server that had a random shut down and never got back online - and yes, that happens to official servers too, like server 89.)\n\n*Optimization:\n   - The game lags horribly and freezes in areas where people build big, fully enclosed bases and have a lot of dinos. It can freeze even for 1-2 minutes and could possibly crash too. Then you, say, fall off your bird, your character gets eaten by a wild dino and your bird gets killed by it too.\n\n*The game is only for people who have a lot of free time:\n   - Breeding (without an event that boosts the raising rates) is horribly time consuming... 28hrs for a baby giga? Where you have to hand-feed it every few minutes or it dies? Really?\n   - Transferring of items between the servers - you can only transfer what you put into your inventory in last 30mins, and once that timer is up, you need to wait another 30 minutes, standing by an obelisk (or tek transmitter if you have one), praying that no wild dino will attack you, that you won't die of cold etc. Very horrible for trading because transferring stacks of metal now takes hours, just for the sake of one dino or blueprint.\n\n*Lack of logical solutions and balance:\n   - End-game is actually not all that fun. They keep \"re-balancing\" the bosses and the ascension, half the time making it impossible to beat it. In the beginning of summer 2017, they made such changes that killing dragon, ape or brood on hard level was almost impossible - and with the dragon, it actually was impossible. No matter how many generations of rexes you must breed and trade for, and imprint, and no matter how good gear you get, it never is enough. The game lacks balanced end-game features that would be achievable through challenges that are possible to complete but do not require glitches or exploits to do that. \n   - I've seen changes that made many people quit or be outraged... take the flyer's nerf, where they crippled the whole group of dinos, believing that they were too overpowered, just because they could transport you quickly from one part of the map to the other... I've seen developers abusing the exploits themselves that they would normally condemn people for: they would put their baby dinos in water in order to keep them in stasis so they didn't need to be fed... Before the game left the early development, its price already jumped from like 20$ to 60-70$? While it still had bugs and badly required fixes and completion (the final boss was not implemented yet).\n    - Servers being full, player-wise (70/70 players at a time) and dino-wise (5k dinos per server), making it impossible to breed and tame.\n   - Most changes are for new players, not veteran players.\n\nAnd leaving the worst thing yet for the end... Deceit. Developers deceived people. How? Well, let's take a look. Firstly, they promised us all that they would not wipe the official servers upon the game release (which happened somewhere at the beginning of September 2017 I believe), then they said that they would actually do the wipe. And then, when they got a very big outrage from the players, they said that they would split the servers into two: part would be \"Legacy\" and that's where the players who played Ark for 2 years before it left early access would be, and \"the New\" servers, that had no connection to Legacy and were a fresh start for anyone who wanted to do so especially in PvP. \nThey said they wouldn't wipe the servers... but then they made a list of \"only the barren, ghost-towns\" servers to shut down and repurpose them for the new cluster.... but from just a \"chunk\", it was almost half of all servers. Players had only FIVE days to move from their server (if it was on the kill-off list\") to a different one. 500 dinos, tons of heavy materials, lots of blueprints, fertilised eggs, their water dinos... For most, it was impossible to do a complete move, so some quit completely, and the rest had to give up at least a part of what they had since they coulnd't transfer it all in such a short period of time.\nAnd then, when everyone settled and thought that the stress is gone... The developers announced that every 3 months, they will be wiping 10% of Legacy servers (\"the bottom ones\", least populated ones) to repurpose them for the New servers... until all Legacy is gone. That being said, ultimately they WILL wipe the Legacy, going against everything they promised to their players, it's just that they will do it over time. And who would want to invest their time, knowing that in the next series of shut-downs, their server might land on the kill-off list? Not many people. That's why most of them either quit, or moved to the New servers (which, by the way, are getting pretty full too).\n\nI do not recommend it. Especially not for the current price. At the beginning, the game might be wonderful. But in long-term, especially towards the end-game where the grind is your new daily routine, it gets frustrating. The decay system is horribly punishing, and unofficial servers have it too, because they don't want their maps to be full of bases yet nobody being online, and none of those things being utilized. The developers are not trustworthy with their words and promises, which in the end could cost somebody a lot of emotional stress and feeling of utter defeat, when your years-worth of work goes to hell. Furthermore, it is not good for people who don't have much time. Playing only on the weekends won't just be enough for official servers. It could be for single-player or unofficial servers, but that's about it.\n\nI ultimately quit because I had to spent 4 days in hospital, just after the game left early access, and came back to some of my dinos dead from starvation and structures auto-decayed. Then my university started and I understood that my priorities should shift from spending all evenings and some nights on this game, especially knowing that if for some reason I don't manage to log in for a few days, I would loose it all, to focusing on my health and education. There are other, way better survival games out there that are not so high-maintenance but also fun to play - and many of them I would recommend over Ark any day.

This title is for people who enjoy an unforgiving survival experience, deep craftng/progression systems and building.  But most of all, it is for those of us that light up with a smile and hear Jurassic Park music in our heads because we love dinosaurs so much.  ARK is quite possibly one of the most ambitious games I've ever engaged with when you look at the various systems at play (food/water, resources, taming, etc.).  I'm hoping that this review will serve as a fresh assessment on the game, considering that I purchased at the end of 2017 when it had already been released out of early access.  I haven't had the opportunity to become jaded through these release cycles, and look at this purely based on my experience as a working title now that I have sunk enough hours in to feel comfortable on this review.  While I realize in retrospect that the publisher released a paid expansion onto the game before it was even a fully released game, my experience tells me that the core game by itself will give you [b]far more[/b] hours than most games on the store.\n\n[h1]Pros:[/h1]\n\n[list][*]DINOSAURS!!  I don't think I'm alone in my infatuation of dinosaurs.  Jurassic Park movies now span across several different age generations, and I'm near positive that regardless of your background or culture, there might have been a few plastic dinosaurs around your house when you were a kid.  The excitement you receive as a new player when seeing your first dinosaurs is something truly special and would often strike awe.  Whether it's the first time you see a brontosaurus towering above you or the first time you get mauled in the face by a raptor, there are always memorable moments.  There are 167 creatures with assuredly more to come, so there is plenty of opportunity to find new curiosities if you like to explore.\n\n[*]The crafting system will both shine as a pro and a con, but it has certainly been one of the more enjoyable aspects of the game for me.  For transparency I have played some PvP on official servers, but a majority of the time on my account so far has been on my private server with a few friends.  Once you add in some of the Workshop mods for the game such as [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=731604991]Structures Plus+[/url], the possibilities for your imagination really open up with what is possible within the game...[url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1281485475]I even started to build my own castle using a different mod.\n\n[*]The ability to cater to so many different types of players is certainly something that should be noted.  With the ability to play on either PvE (Player vs Environment) or PvP (Player vs Player) official servers,  as well as host or pay for your own private servers, really opens the options up wide for what type of game experience you want.  Would you rather build an amazing base and tame dinosaurs, or use your dinosaurs to try and conquer against other players?  This in addition to mod support from the Steam Workshop really allows this game to be the kind of experience you prefer to play if you are creative enough.\n\n[*]Similar to the crafting it will serve primarily as a pro, but with some con listed below.  Beyond that disclaimer lets be honest, this game is gorgeous.  The game is running UE4 using a lot of assets from the UE4 workshop which has probably made the game easier to scale into it's ambitious state.  There are moments where I'll just stop and look at at a vista or look up at the sky for a moment to take it all in.[/list]\n\n\n[h1]Cons:[/h1]\n\n[list][*]Do you have a good computer?  No but seriously...do you?  This game is an absolute beast to run with settings turned up.  Part of this is because of the sheer expansiveness of the environments they have crafted, some of this could probably boil down to optimization.  Running a 1080ti I can do most games at 4k resolution (if not slightly tweaked down), but running this game on epic is beyond being an option.  If you fall into column B and know that your computer might not be up to snuff, you will either have to enjoy potato graphics settings, or may not like the experience at all.\n\n[*]Snap points and terrain/mesh issues become a very common occurrence during your playtime in ARK, and one that will infuriate you some days and on others just annoy you.  As long as you have a good attitude most of these things can be funny as long as you have the philosophy that nothing is sacred in ARK, and that you might lose everything including dinosaurs in a single moment.  Regardless of how you cope, be prepared to lose a few hours here or there because a dinosaur got stuck in a tree or a rock.  Also be prepared to yell at your monitor when building sometimes, because a piece will just simply refuse to go where you want it to.  Beyond this the game has it's fair share of bugs as well, but the sheer scope of the game and the fun you can have at the very least make this more redeeming.\n\n[*]I would say that this would be rather specific to the type of player that I am, but PvP can be very difficult for a casual player on official servers.  In a younger stage of my life I avidly played MMOs and would graciously spend my waking life at the PC, and there will be an audience of players that are in fact looking exactly for this.  Unless you are able to secure joining a large tribe of players and or play a large amount of time, you're living in ARK will be \"humble\" to say it nicely.  While I still enjoy what time I have played PvP and do plan on playing more soon, I could see this being a punishing aspect for newer or more casual players.  Metas may become frustrating, and some of the reasons that I'm not upset with the developers on,  may instead be something you are upset about in this situation.  As a lone wolf you can still have fun in the game on a public PvP server, provided you do not want to complete all the content.[/list]\n\n[h1]Conclusion:[/h1]\n\nFor people who have not played ARK and are considering to pick-up this title, seriously don't fret over the mixed reviews.  The base game will provide you more hours of content than 98% of games on the Steam store, and the season pass could potentially provide you just as much.  Play the game in the ways that [i]you enjoy having fun[/i], if you aren't enjoying yourself you are probably doing it wrong.  Choose PvP vs PvE based on your needs and play style, and if you get really bored just spin-up your own server and start having some mod and admin fun!  I would suggest this game to anyone who likes a challenging experience, enjoys progression and enjoys an open world with beautiful attractions.\n\n\n\n[i]If you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Original_Curators_Group#curation]Follow Original Curator Group[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1516993342, "timestamp_updated": 1517692057, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 474, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.902451574802398682", "comment_count": 46, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16149060": {"recommendationid": "16149060", "author": {"steamid": "76561198040883213", "num_games_owned": 570, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 42592, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549322047}, "language": "english", "review": "-Made a tiny home out of thatch\n-Knocked out a few different Dinos\n-Learned how to tame\n-Random Raptor comes out of nowhere, Kills me\n-Spawn again, Start to swim back to my stuff\n-Raptor again, Die\n-Watch it run away, Grab my stuff\n-Find/ trick raptor to attack again, Stab it to death\n-Hack away at it while I defecate on it's corpse\n-Find a Dodo army, Knock one out, Kill the rest\n-Tame Dodo, Named it Dumbo\n-Walk back home with Dumbo\n-The adventure begins\n*EDIT*\n-The adventure continued\n-Walk along beach till I find friend\n-Chase supply drop\n-Friend get's killed by Dilos, Dilos kill Dumbo\n-Punch Dilos out of rage. kill one and die\n-Come back to gather our belongings, Loot Dumbo\n-Find Dilo\n-Decided Dilo can spend his life in hell, knock it out and tame her\n-Named it Dil Don't\n-Meet up with friend, fu*ck around for a bit\n-Find some Dodos, Kill 3 tame one\n-Named it Dumbo Jr.\n-One more Friend comes on, start making base.\n-Leave Dil Don't and Dumbo Jr at base, leave to get matirials\n-Notifacation the Dumbo Jr has died, Freak out\n-Arrive to find Dil Don't Killing another Dilo\n-Dil Don't gets revenge for Dumbo Jr\n-Loot Dumbo Jr's corpse and find her egg\n-The Adventure continues\n*EDIT 2*\n-The Adventure Continued\n-Still pis*sed about loss of Dombo Jr, Decide not to tame Dodos until it is safe\n-Tribe and I decide we need meat, For Dil Don't and us\n-Run around killing fish, Dilos and Dodos, Spot a Parasaur being dumb\n-Ask tribe if we have Narcoberries, We do\n-It's Time\n-Take out my slingshot and tribe proceeds to surround the beast\n-Take aim and fire, headshot\n-Chase the beast around flinging rocks at it, It runs into a rock and get's stuck\n-After a little longer he's down, Shove all my berries into his inventory\n-Have one friend stay and make sure he eats his Narcoberries, Me and Dil Don't go hunting\n-Take out some turtles and Dilos while other friend runs over\n-Spot some more Parasaurs, decide for some bigger game\n-Take out 1 but 3 other attempts failed\n-Friend has tamed the Parasaur, Named it Pee Tree \n-Time skip while gathering food and supplies, Basically we want to move from the beach\n-Tribe and I leave behind Pee Tree and Dil Don't to find a way up the mountain\n-On our way up we all get separated, I make it to the top\n-Fu*cking view right outta Jurassic Park, One large lake and a lot of big Dinos, I'm in love\n-Run down along the herbivores and watch a Raptor get killed by Tyrannosaurus X2\n-Spot a slight line between herbivores and carnivores, stick with the plant eaters\n-Make it to the lake and spot some Mammoths, I want one\n-Look just past them and see a T-rex on the opposite side of the lake\n-Run back to friends, Once back see one of them has a Dilo named Moogle\n-Dil Don't is female and Moogle is male, Start to plan birthing an army of Dilos\n-Tribe and Dinos in tow start towards the location I found\n-Have some hiccups on the way because Pee Tree's path finding is garbage\n-Along the way we find Phiomia along the way\n-Get excited about riding it, One member keeps going while me and another hang back to tame\n-Tame it and we Named him Truffles, Realize I'm almost level 10\n-Run around gathering and killing smaller Dinos for hide and finally I'm level 10\n-Now I make a saddle for Truffles but also a saddle for Pee Tree\n-Me and friend ride our Dinos to the location, Him on Truffles and me on Pee Tree\n-We arrive in the dead of night and start building\n-The adventure continues...........", "timestamp_created": 1433308031, "timestamp_updated": 1480182635, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1450, "votes_funny": 3258, "weighted_vote_score": "0.855176925659179688", "comment_count": 110, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25302378": {"recommendationid": "25302378", "author": {"steamid": "76561197995162679", "num_games_owned": 121, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 32066, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506039226}, "language": "english", "review": "Love this game.

Here are a few (based on Official Primitive PVP server):\n\nPVP. It isn't really PVP, more like alpha bullies imposing their will on smaller tribes and some of those are even so cowardly as to do it while you're offline. Fairness or balance aren't even on the same planet.\n\nPushing out a paid DLC before the original game is optimized, let alone finished.\nAnd this while the backlash from NMS hadn't even died down yet.

Now this is the biggest BS I have seen in 22 years of online gaming. \nThis basically means that anyone can bring anything from one server to another. In other words, some rectal jerk can raise a wyvern (yes, paid DLC) on a safe server, then transfer them over to a primitive server and raze it to the ground (few, if any, counter measures can withstand a wyvern on primitive). \nThis means that the local alpha tribe will block all known supply drops (that's the way in) and the developer in turn creates new locations for the supply drops, and-so-on ad nauseum. Consequently, higher level engrams are also no longer available, especially to the newcomers and lower tribes.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have had tons of fun. There are bugs, performance could, nay *should* be better, but overall I've had a blast.\nJust getting tired of the gaming industry's growing dis-ingeniousness.

Certain aspects of the game were directly or indirectly promised when the initial purchase of the game was put into Early Access.  Reference: https://i.imgur.com/orZRTAU.png  and http://ark.gamepedia.com/Upcoming_Features\n\n\n2.  Those aspects of the game are now being resold to us as PAID DLC.  Meaning they are double dipping charging us again for the same promised content.  Technically speaking yes it could still be released at a later date into the core game, however the point is they released this FIRST before finishing the main game.  Also this next point is two sided.  Its great they DO LISTEN to modders and even take those mods and incorporate them into the game.  However the problem is when they take those idea then put them into a paid DLC that has similar features of free mods out there.  This ties into the below qoute from a Wild Card Employee, many of those free \"dlc\" started as community ideas or mods.  Example:  The Center Map\n\n\n3.  The general attitude of employees of Wild Card.  Examples(unverified): https://imgur.com/a/l3d8M\n\n\"We don't want to charge players more than we have to,\" he said. \"That's why we give away a lot of free DLC.

Repeated lack of community relations regarding bugs.  Lack of support for said bugs.\n\n\n4.  In my opinion slimey tactics and loopholes to try and brush of the fact they are charging $20 for DLC behind a paywall which is essentialy pay to win:\n\nhttp://imgur.com/qOsQIUA\n\nhttps://twitter.com/arkjesse/status/771529281289592833\n\n\n5.

While there is PLENTY of content and more than worth the base price of the game.  Wild Card seemed to have started going off on tangents with the game that was not part of the core game, which what was sold to us.  And it seems to me at least no one asked for these things or considers them needed.  Example like SOTF, Primitive plus, the playing as a dino one.  No one disputes the core game is solid and worth the money.  I would have gladly paid $60 for it.\n\nThe problem is all these things taking away from the fact the base game is TERRIBLE when it comes to both performance and being a relietively bug free expirence.  This is not even mentioning the problem with lack of moderation in the OFFICIAL SERVERS themselves.

In this time, however, I've played on both PVP and PVE servers and had a go at hosting a server of my own.\n\nWhen I first bought ARK I quit the game after 2 minutes and didn't return to it for months. My PC isn't a beast, but it plays all the games I own at a decent Frames Per Second with good settings. I was absolutely astounded, however, when I could barely hit 10 FPS on the lowest of settings. It was completely unplayable and a great deal of the community had the same problem. A few months later and the developers have patched and updated the game so much that, with a few 'launch parameters', I can play this game at around 50 FPS with good settings. This game IS demanding, but I would think negatively towards anyone who doesn't recommend this game based on it's performance. It's come along way already - think how much further it can be optimised!\n\nBut most people know about the performance issues and if YOU didn't know about them before this, I suggest you read into it on the forums etc. to make sure you'll be happy with the game you purchase. Now that the boring stuff is out of the way, let's talk about the gameplay!\n\nThe first server I joined was an Official PVP server. This means that the gather rate, XP gain, taming speed etc. was all at standard speed (x1). If you're new to the game, or you've only played on x1 servers this may not seem that bad, but trust me, it gets VERY tedious, VERY quickly. You could end up having to babysit an unconscious T-Rex for hours upon hours while it tames, only for it to get killed in a raid or PVP fight in minutes. If you have the time and patience, then please be my guest.\n\nNow, if all the servers had these settings and the modding community wasn't as great as it is, I would have probably never played this game again. Instead, you can find a plethora of servers packed with mods and custom settings that, in my opinion, REALLY bring the game to life! Some servers are a little bit silly, being about to tame an extremely high level Bronto in 2 mins for example, but if that's your cup of tea, don't let anyone stop you!\n\nThe aforementioned mods are numerous and varied, ranging from new content such as advanced machinery, to level changing scripts that make wild dinos stronger and even total coversion mods that change the whole game so you're either a pirate or stuck permanently in 'cave-man mode'.\n\nI for one, will never be able to go back to a vanilla (un-modded) server with x1 settings. It's too much of a chore. If you're hesitant about wether you'll be able to put up with it too, check the Steam Workshop and you'll see what I mean. Check YouTube too. There are many famous youtubers with daily episodes.\n\nI purposely have avoided detailed descriptions of things you can do in this game because I think it's more fun to explore them yourself. Besides, there are many reviews with that kind of info already.\n\nI hope this review helped at least some what! \n\n-XCAL\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1462623098, "timestamp_updated": 1462623098, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 132, "votes_funny": 12, "weighted_vote_score": "0.843070149421691895", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "22221492": {"recommendationid": "22221492", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960514594", "num_games_owned": 550, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 63073, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521004797}, "language": "english", "review": "TL;DR : great game but has performances and finishing touchs to be made,\n\ni write this after just above 1050 hours played,\nin those 1050 hours i've expirienced \n* starting with nothing and dying over and over again to learn the game\n* starting with stuff and becoming a great power in a server\n* getting a decent and normal server being overrun by a chinese tribe\n* starting over , and over, and over\n* convering a public official server in to a somewhat of a democracy with a website and stats and element of control\n\nThe good : \n[list]\n [*] the survival aspects of the game are great up to around level 60 its probably the best survival expirience game out there currently, (after level 60 you are a bit OP and only die to self stupidity)\n [*] the 'things to do' are virtually endless (i didnt feel like i ran out of things to accomplish even after 1000 hours)\n [*] the graphics is stunning\n [*] the base building and 'tribe wars' and overall community aspect of the game is great\n [*] the resource gathering is nicely balanced , very hard at start, grindy at mid, and once you  min max with dinos and what not its great even as a solo player\n [*] there are planty of items in the game and types of dinos\n[/list]\n\nThe Bad :\n[list]\n [*] the lag, the lag is real, rubber banding is a plague and really hurts the game expirience, i know there is limited ability to do something about that, even more so on official servers, but still, thats the core expirience of the game\n[*] the fps, as someone with a bit of above avrg computer (3960x, 980x2, 32gb ram, ssd and so on) i get 30fps at points and fps is very jumpy, expected from an early access game, but stating this for the record\n[/list]\n\noverall i've had a great time with this game and i've stoped playing it mostly coz i ran out of time irl to play a high demanding game like that,\n\nkeep up the good work developers\n", "timestamp_created": 1459700989, "timestamp_updated": 1459700989, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 123, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820032060146331787", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "33431893": {"recommendationid": "33431893", "author": {"steamid": "76561197972180609", "num_games_owned": 299, "num_reviews": 7, "playtime_forever": 27194, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1528647311}, "language": "english", "review": "Played SO MUCH Ark over the time its been in early access, and have owned it since almost day 1.\n\nARK was barely worth the original cost of \u00a318 when it was released, though the developers slowly started top release more and more content, however:\n\nThe more dinosaurs they add, the more invalid and pointless the old dinosaurs are.

Yeah, another convoluted grind for the sole purpose of making grinding easier.\n\nDinosaurs are LITERALLY all about sitting afk beside the dinosaurs bosy wasting your time so you might grind quicker later on, provided of course the stupid fuck doesnt die within the first 9 minutes of being tamed, and provided you can find ONE person on a 50 man server who is not a complete shit rag to make a saddle for you.\n\n\nIf you are an absolute fucking idiot (or masochist, or a chinese gold grinder) then the official servers with the extremely stupid low gather rates, low experience rates and MASSIVE tame timers (For some of the bigger dinosaurs be prepared to sit there ALL FUCKING SAY, only to have one of the other 48 members of the server who ARE shit rags come and kill your dinosaur mere minutes before its even tamed) would be perfect, WOULD be perfect, if the developers hadnt allowed cross server transfers. \n\nSince cross server transfers have been possible, the community have witnessed what can onlyt be known as some form of \"Burning Legion\" where the communists of Russia and China emegrate FULL tribes of people who are level capped with END GAME gear to a server, ransack the server, destroy all player made structures, kill all player tamed dinosaurs then leave. If you are still an absolute fucking reject, then by all means play on the official servers, but be warned, you WILL have to bow before Sargeras and suck some commie dick.\n\nIf you are NOT the aforementioned idiot, you will obviously be more drawn towards the private servers. The private servers have increased gather and experience rates and dinosaurs will tame quicker. Sounds great, but wise men teach us that if it sounds to good to be true, it usually is. Although your grind wont be as mind numbingly painful to the point you will be mining stone with your forehead irl, you are going to have to deal with the denizens of a private server. These people are literally the swathes of humanity that have never developed real social skills and will in turn try and grief you at every single chance they get since the world seemingly owes them a favour. You can spend literally hours looking for a good private server, and all you are really looking for is which server has the least amount of Downs Syndrome. \n\n\nTLDR: Nope.

Most of the fun stuff they advertise - taming dinos, exploring the map, hunting, breeding, - come second only to defending what you own. Because ARK has no safe zones, everything you acquire in the game has to be stored in areas you yourself have established. Other players who are more active than you WILL destroy your base.\n\n2) PVE IS NOT A REALISTIC OPTION. \n\nThere are PVE only servers in the game, but literally ALL of them have already been claimed by someone and they have gone out of their way to block all the good spots on the map. Even the spawn points where noobs come in for the first time are all blocked with structures. And since the server is PVE, the game wont allow you to destroy any of the offending structures other players have built, even if it's a straw hut right on top of a spawn point. You might be thinking, \"So go PVP servers and play better then, you noob!\" Well...\n\n2) PVP WANTS YOU TO SELL YOUR SOUL TO THE GAME. \n\nWinning PVP is not skill based. Whoever dedicates more hours will have more ammo and more dinos and will win every single time. The game requires your tribe to be online 24/7 if you don't want to lose ALL of your progress. That is not an exaggeration. Apart from your character's level, you will lose EVERYTHING if you so much as take a break to study for exams, or talk to your children, or get hospitalized for playing videogames too much because...\n\n3) YOU MUST COMPETE WITH THE ENTIRE PLANET. \n\nBefore the recent updates, you only had to out-produce the 50 or so people on your server. But now the devs have made it possible for other players from any official server to transfer their high level characters, dinos and items to any other official server. (Note that un-official servers are immune to this but they are unreliable. They will get deleted if the owner stops paying for the rent) This means that megatribes with hundreds of active members can very easily transfer in and reduce your smaller, more casual tribe into a long, greasy underwear stain. \n\nIf you and your buddies are casual gamers you either have to be slaves to a megatribe, become a megatribe yourselves or be naked, homeless dudes running around punching trees. There is absolutely no middle ground. Okay... so let's be naked dudes!\n\n4) BECOMING A HOMELESS RAIDER IS THE ONLY CASUAL GAME EXPERIENCE TO BE HAD. AND IT SUCKS.\n\nBe a nomad, own nothing, build nothing, just come in and destroy people's belongings for the lols. Nothing to lose, so you can log out and play whenever you want. That's one way to play, I suppose. But the problem with that is that you can only really raid, or more appropriately \"grief\" low level players. And if that's how you get your rocks off, then I hope you choke on a dick. But bigger tribes are basically immune to anything small time raiders with no base can dish out. You'll never get to do anything else, like exploring caves or taming large dinosaurs. And once you are a known griefer in your server, big tribes will probably blow up all your structures on sight. All you can do is grief noobs into quitting the game. \n\nThere was a time where ARK allowed for making friends with people on your server and establishing alliances. But these days, the devs are making a lot of changes that discourages you from that. And that is why...\n\n5) HIGH LEVEL PLAYERS HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO BE COMPLETE D-BAGS TO NOOBS IN ORDER TO SURVIVE. \n\nBecause anyone from anywhere in the world can now just come in to your backyard with unlimited resources and completely wipe your entire server, security has become a critical issue for powerful but otherwise peaceful tribes. Some random guy can simply create a new character in the server he wants to invade, set up an outpost and unload their powerful gear. \n\nAlliances with other tribes could potentially make matters worse. Allied players can come over to your base and your automated defenses will not harm them. This doesnt stop them from planting C4 though... So any invader can come in, pretend to be nice, join one of your allied tribes and you wouldnt be the wiser. He can then just come over to your base and plant bombs on your gate while he says hi to the T-rex that's supposed to be guarding it. And since you have no control over who other tribes recruit, nor can you ask them to pay for any damage they cause, you're better off not allying with noob tribes at all.\n\nUnfortunately the only way for established players to truly secure their server from invaders is to not trust anyone. Any noob that tries to come in has to be killed, no questions asked. Even worse, some tribes have now resorted to lining spawn points with defenses to kill anyone trying to enter the server. And as for your already established bases, you will need defenses built en masse if you dont want them destroyed. Which leads to my next point...\n\n6) THE END GAME IS 90% GRINDING FOR RESOURCES. \n\nBecause of the relentless, global-scale PVP, you need defenses on every side and corner of your base. And that requires literally all of your time grinding non-stop for resources to build and replenish the mass amounts of turrets and bullets needed to repel the inevitable arrival of hostile megatribes, who they themselves are producing at a far greater rate from the safety of their own servers. You may repel them at first. But they will come in waves. Endlessly. At anytime. So for you to survive, it's producing turrets and bullets forever. No fun exploration or hunting... just mining metal and making godamn bullets. If you want to grind resources and build towers, you're better off playing Clash of Clans. But even if you somehow accomplish this, it still doesn't make you safe because...\n\n7) THE GAME ITSELF IS FULL OF GLITCHES AND EXPLOITS.\n\nIt's bad enough that other players want you dead, but the game itself is actually a much bigger annoyance. Wild dinosaurs can spawn inside your most secure buildings for no apparent reason and destroy your most valuable items/furnitures/dinos before your turrets can have a chance to react. Even your own dinos can literally vanish because the game simply deleted them from the server. You can be in the middle of a heated battle on your most hard-earned dinosaur only for the game to crash, and 5 mins later you come back and you and your dino are already dead. Experienced raiders can even use the game's plethora of exploits to their advantage- turrets not shooting when you carry a dodo with you, or phasing through walls, or creating 2nd accounts to farm resources. You could do everything right and still lose because the game is simply so glitchy. But maybe you're thinking that this is early access, and bugs will be fixed soon? Nope.\n\n8) DEVS COULDNT GIVE A SINGLE FUCK ABOUT GAMEPLAY. \n\nWildcard is a very small development team that makes money from purchases. Not subscriptions or microtransactions or e-sports. Which means they only make money off of someone who buys their game, not from someone who is still playing it 2 weeks later. Sales quantity over product quality. That's their business model. They add more and more new creatures and items every month to stay relevant and lure in new people, but the same bugs and annoyances that have been around for years are still unchanged.\n\nARK is supposedly still in-development, and the idea is that we give them money to finish the game.

So either find a private community prior to purchase or do not buy. Also do not just tell me to play singleplayer, your response will be deleted.\n\nI have played this game since day one alpha release, and I can tell you right now, there had to be a management and design shift right around march of 2016. In its infancy, the game was incredibly fun. It was a fight for survival, where you would try to get shelter up as fast as possible, just so little bugs wouldn't eat you alive. After that you would gather resources, hunt for food, defend yourself, make armor and weapons. You would then set out for a tame, usually something small like a pig or a parasaur, maybe even a raptor if you want to live dangerous. This tame would help you gather more resources, as it could carry even more resources. This was a rinse and repeat cycle of taming new creatures to serve different purposes, to then help expand your base and get better and better tames, with an end goal of fighting a boss. \n\nYou could go solo, or make/join a tribe, allowing several players to work together, this made the game INCREDIBLY more fun (getting on a bunch of high level raptors with friends and devouring anything you came across was incredibly satisfying). Then you could work with or against other tribes, as you could trade resources or give old tames if they are newer. You could also go to war with another tribe, attacking their base, proving your worth. The other option is to take your tame and go stomp the dude who just made his first thatch hut, this is where the problems start. At first there was only minor griefing and was mainly done by Brazilians (I don't know why, and I have nothing against brazilian people, its just the griefers on the servers I played on way back were all brazilian). They would run up to you naked with a spear, and try and stab you to death. Usually you were with a tame or had a weapon and could easily deal with them, and to be honest, isnt really game breaking as hes just a naked dude with a spear. As more and more people became aware of what these guys were doing, it became less of a problem as anyone who found a Br (brazilian) would call it out, and we would stay on guard for a bit and they would eventually get tired of getting slaughtered and leave. \n\nFast foward a few months, and now they updated the pteranadon, a fast flyer for those who dont know, giving it a barrel attack move. This would increase the damage it did significantly, and make it move incredibly fast. This was cool at first, but was quickly adopted by more advanced griefers, as pteranadons were very easy tames. The game quickly became litered with people getting pteras, flying around and dashing through people, killing them, or worse, swooping in extremely fast, picking them up, flying high, and dropping them, causing no kill message to occur. This was an insane problem for newer players as they had no way of fighting back, causing them to get whiped repeatedly for just attempting to play the game, and was even an issue for advanced players as if you had things like rifles on your body and he insta killed you before you could kill him, the guns were now his and he could grief even more people with them. As far as I am aware, the ptera issue is still highly presistant to-date. \n\nThe next issue was server dominance. Some servers would get to the point where only one tribe was on them as they whiped out every other tribe on the server. Many of the now \"legacy\" servers still have this issue, and its bound to happen with the new ones. If you go on one of these dominated servers, not knowing it, you would wake up and your character would be handcuffed,  in a prison with full weight so you couldn't jump to drain stamana to die, so unless you wanted to wait 2 hours for your food to run out and starve everytime you wanted to start over on that server, you just ditched that server and looked elsewhere. I actually met the individual who made spawn camping a bannable offense, as he spent 2 real life days with a friend, building metal traps at each and every spawn location on the map, trapping any character who freshly spawned on the server, This was in an attempt to lock down their server to the point that they wouldn't have to worry about sweeping their server every day to make sure no new spawns showed up. Now this was a really messed up thing, but at least it was contained to that server, keyword being was.\n\nNow with the two issues I just told you about, and the devs doing NOTHING to stop it (except for the spawn camping, but i'll get to why they banned that later), they did the last thing anyone but griefers and mega-tribes wanted. They added server transfering. Now in theroy this is to allow active players to swap from an inactive server to a active one, without losing all of their stuff. This is actually really neat, and if it was only used for this purpose then I'm all for it. What happened though was there was a very short cooldown on transfering, and you could bring EVERYTHING from one server to the next, all tames, all gear, any/all supplies. In the following days, those mega-tribes I mentioned before, that were farming resources, extremely powerful tames, and extremely high quality gear, would start to server hop at night, when no one was on, starting in one corner of the map and working their way to the other, wiping out any and all tribes on said server, leaving everyone there, who has played for months or even over a year, and get wiped by guys they never saw before. As far as the ptera griefers went, they just transfered server to server, killing people, taking their stuff, than then leaving the server, with no way of knowing where they went, so there is no way to even attempt getting back at them.  \n\nOnce all this happened, I stopped playing for a while, as so did many, but months later I heard they did away with server transfer, so I started playing again. They then released scorched earth, and a few buddies of mine and I got it and played together, and it was incredibly fun. Then came the patch notes, and guess what, server transfering was back, after a lot of people payed money for the expansion. \n\nPlayers attempted to make server transfer non existent on the player side, by blocking the obilesk, the giant pointy towers, as thats how you would transfer stuff. The devs later made it to where at any loot drop, you could transfer stuff, this led players to blocking loot drops, meaning now all that rare loot, you could no longer aquire. The devs then made drops land on top of objects, meaning you could no longer block them, and made blocking oblisk bannable. This lead to server transfer becoming an issue again, and people started getting unfairly wiped again by people who used unethical methods of warfare and would raid offline tribes.\n\nIt then became clear their goals were to scam people into buying the game, and then ruin it after they get it so they can shut down servers. At this point, bugs were not being fixed, and more and more unbalanced content, that only made mega tribes stronger, was being released. This was clearly to reel in new players, with all the cool videos of the game, only to find out its griefer city. Now, remember when I said I'd explain why spawn camping was specifically the only griefing made banable? It was because if a new player jumped on a dominated server, unknowingly, and was spawn camped, they would maybe try 2-3 more times, but would probably give up, uninstall the game and get a refund. By banning spawn camping, new and unsuspecting players would easily be able to play past the 2 hour refund window before learning all their hard work was for nothing as their character ends up in a prison and everything they made, just gone.", "timestamp_created": 1509212278, "timestamp_updated": 1509735182, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1113, "votes_funny": 73, "weighted_vote_score": "0.826793968677520752", "comment_count": 156, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19101566": {"recommendationid": "19101566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058032537", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 29675, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1509957872}, "language": "english", "review": "Day 1: Wake up on strange island.

I've seen ARK evolve from its earliest days to where it stands now. I also own the dubious Scorched Earth expansion. I've taken part in pretty much every kind of activity to be found in ARK: solo building, working with small public tribes, all the way up to large scale alpha tribe vs alpha tribe PVP. Granted, there are -plenty- of people who have more time in ARK than me, but I've pretty much seen it all. Now with all that said, and considering everything I've seen and played, I cannot recommend ARK. Here's why.\n\nIf you really, really wanted to boil it down into the most basic explaination possible, it's because ARKs combat is simply not fun. All the other issues in the game all relate back to this point in one way or the other. Allow me to explain. \n\nLook at ARKs promotional videos and ask yourself what you see. You'll see armies of players alongside T-Rexes fighting across open fields. You'll see epic assaults on heavily defended bases by seige platforms mounted on mighty dinosaurs. Look at the promotional pictures here on Steam. You'll see trader caravans escorted by raptor cavalry making long treks across the island. You are probably thinking of buying the game so you too can take part in these epic struggles for survival.  \n\nI'll tell you right now that you will NEVER experience ANY of that. Wanna know how ARK combat REALLY goes down? You farm up C4 for a week and then wait for your target to go offline. Then you and your tribe go to their base, which is in fact not an epic castle but a metal cube slathered in auto-turrets, and you drop friggin turtles on their base until their turrets run out of ammo. Then you take your C4 and blow your way in. If their dinosaurs are all on passive stance, just shoot them in the face until they die. If they are on nuetral, lure them out of the base and have your own dinos kill them at your leisure. Once all their dinos are dead, just keep blowing stuff up and stealing everything until you run out of explosives. If your REALLY lucky, one of their guys might get on and you MIGHT have a firefight. Then the next morning you can get on and hear them crying that they lost 6 months of work in one night. Eventually, one day you will suffer the same fate. Of course, all of this is assuming that you and your tribe reach the point where you can raid bases, and that you and your tribe weren't effortlessly curbstomped by an already established tribe the moment you set down your first foundation. \n\nThe entire game, and I do mean the ENTIRE GAME, consists of nothing but months of grinding resources to do that exact thing. ARK demands that you invest so much time in it that it might as well be a part time job, and when the chips are down and all is said and done, the end result of all your labor is going to be blowing up a metal cube. Every other activity in the game is nothing but grinding up to get to that point. \n\nIn summery, all the neat gear, all the cool dinosaurs, and all the other features of ARK become a zero sum game when the end experience is something as uninspiring as offline raiding.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nAddendum: It has come to my attention that many people are expressing their opinion that options such as PvE mode, private servers, mods, etc invalidate my points and redeem the game. \n\nFirstly, if the community of players have to start enforcing their own personal rules (ie. private servers) or adding their own content (ie. mods) in order to make the game palpable, then that is a telling sign that the games core, fundemental mechanics are intrinsically flawed. I do not believe it is the responsibility of the community to fix a games flaws. Things like mods and private servers should be tools to enchance an already well built game, not used as crutches to sidestep a games core issues. I am writing my review concerning the game as the developers intended it to be played; which I believe has serious shortcomings that show no signs of getting fixed. I don't think its fair to potential customers to review a game any other way.\n\nSecondly, PVE servers suffer from a myriad of problems. First and foremost, by eliminating direct player competition, you remove about 50% of the games entire premise. I found that some of the most fun aspects of ARK involved server politics such as alliances, betrayals, territorial skirmishes, rescues, ambushes, etc etc. By taking out any form of player vs player engagments, you can forget about all that. Which leaves you with... what exactly? You will collect dinosaurs to sit in your corral, you go spulunking through a few caves, and MAYBE if your REALLY lucky, you'll fight a boss with some other players, although good luck getting enough people to help you with that last one. The fact of the matter is that the PVE elements to this game, while much deeper than other survival games out there, are simply not compelling enough to stand on their own two feet. That's not even touching on the fact that PVE servers STILL have ways where other players can screw you over (for example, surrounding your base with foundations to prevent you from building, and preventing resources from spawning nearby) and since it's a PVE server you have absolutely no methods of retaliating.\n\nARK has great potential and can frankly be a lot of fun. People wouldn't spend 500+ hours in this game if it wasn't at least kinda fun. However, the fact of the matter is that it's potential is horribly squandered by boring combat, tedious grinding, balance issues, and several downright stupid mechanics (bringing back server transfers? After what happened last time? Really?). Paying customers should not have to put up with this considering how long ARK has been in development. At this point, it's obvious the game is only going downhill, so I can't recommend it to new players.", "timestamp_created": 1496123791, "timestamp_updated": 1497778491, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2231, "votes_funny": 131, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837283849716186523", "comment_count": 140, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "26704393": {"recommendationid": "26704393", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032882485", "num_games_owned": 323, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 175938, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1497558709}, "language": "english", "review": "At close to 3k hours played, seeing the Ark world from the ground level, and from the Mega Tribe level, this is what I have learned: \nCheating, Exploiting, Hacking, Duping is Not allowed in the game, UNLESS you are or have \"famous\" streamers in your tribe, or friends of game Devs, and such staff.\n\nThese privileged tribes move their things and them selves from server to server, magically turning off defensive turrets, lagging out the servers they attack to the point where defensive dinos will not do damage, among countless other things which have been recorded both by defenders AND by the streamers them selves..

Very frustrating is trying to tab out to use chat programs briefly, which the game frequently responds to by crashing.\n\nThe recent for-pay expansion is really disheartening: a large amount of new content before the game is 'released', before making the base game actually functional for those who have already purchased it.\n\nOnce these issues are dealt with I would recommend this game, but in the state it's currently in trying to play is only frustrating.", "timestamp_created": 1472818101, "timestamp_updated": 1472818101, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 28, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541633546352386475", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": true}, "25312585": {"recommendationid": "25312585", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973531430", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 15084, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1530040815}, "language": "english", "review": "224 hours on this game.

Play with a few friends and split up responsibilities. Have a little dino army and go hunt some big game. Grab a couple pack dinos and head into the mountains for a mining trip, set up camp and stay warm while warding off predators at night. Honestly its really fun. But there are 3 reasons why I cannot recommend this. First off being this game is so poorly optimized its almost unplayable on anything but the lowest of settings. Which makes it very, very ugly. Second, the absolutely atrocious initial load time. It is just not acceptable to take 5-10 minutes to load up a game when I just want to pop on a do a couple things then jump off. 3rd being as everyone else is saying. Paid DLC in a game that is still in alpha, that is being sold for 30 dollars to start with, is just unnaceptable. The game isn't out of alpha. its 30 bucks. So thats already too much money for a glitchfest, unfinished game. Then these greedy devs put out a 20 dollar dlc? wouldn't that just be an update? I don't quite understand how that works. Thats an update. If the game isn't finished, you cant have dlc, its an update. thats a 20 dollar update.
