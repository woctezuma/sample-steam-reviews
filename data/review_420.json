So this is what the wait for Half Life 3 feels like. \n\nHalf Life 2 Episode Two is the sequel to Episode One and begins straight away. We find ourselves in the outskirts of City 17 as the Citadel has now opened a portal to the Combines home world and it's now up to us to find a way to the rebel base and shut down the portal once and for all.\n\nThe gameplay is identical to previous titles in the Half Life 2 games.  Overall there's not much to say here as it's basically DLC to Half Life 2. \n\nGraphics wise this game looks a tad bit better than Half Life 2 due to the range rendering, which I thought was under used in Half Life 2 Episode One. The portal coming from the citadel can be seen throughout the entire game which looks outstanding.\n\nThere is a reason this is my favorite Half Life title and that's the action sequences. This game is like a great action movie. Action scenes after action scenes after action scenes and it all ends up to one of the biggest cliffhanger endings in history of gaming. I'm not joking it actually pains me not knowing what happens next.\n\nI also love the incredible soundtrack. It's beyond kick ass and is one of my favorite game soundtracks of all time.\n\nIn the end Half Life 2 Episode Two is a thrilling ride and it should be played by everyone. I'm glad I finally joined the bandwagon. Now I can join the Half Life 3 waiting community. \n\nFinal Rating:\n10/10 - A must own and a must play\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page [url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/snortsreviews#curation]here[/url] - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!", "timestamp_created": 1446414482, "timestamp_updated": 1511386871, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 120, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.8508339524269104", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "25971765": {"recommendationid": "25971765", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002472329", "num_games_owned": 263, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1517781664}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you Valve, for this wonderful 9 year long cliffhanger.", "timestamp_created": 1476129050, "timestamp_updated": 1476129050, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 8, "weighted_vote_score": "0.81523895263671875", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "32302083": {"recommendationid": "32302083", "author": {"steamid": "76561198183214053", "num_games_owned": 32, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 572, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548018483}, "language": "english", "review": "with memorable characters\n and tears to be shed\n i wrote this poem off the top of my head.\n\nThe hunters look awesome\ntoo bad they can't play possum\nthe game needs a sequel\nnot another prequel.\n\nantlions suck\nbut i squished them to muck\nthats my review\nenjoy half life 2", "timestamp_created": 1497042977, "timestamp_updated": 1497042977, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 138, "votes_funny": 63, "weighted_vote_score": "0.889342725276947021", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13357804": {"recommendationid": "13357804", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100696152", "num_games_owned": 60, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1863, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1438456171}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life = An awesome 1990's throwback game that's still fun to play.\n\nHalf-Life 2 = Arguably the greatest first-person shooter of all time.

I am simply pointing out Valve's inconsistent and frankly intolerable behavior towards the community that played an inherent role in shaping the company in who they are today. And if we want them to communicate with us we need to send a message, and reviews are a good way to do that. Don't like it? Tough.

Whatever happened internally at valve, it's over now. Here's the link:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urza2sbU68Q\n\nIt really pains me to give this game a negative review, because mechanically, the Half-Life series has always been incredible. Half-Life 2 and its' episodes redefined the way a working physics engine could redefine a whole game - and it works beautifully! Also, it's worth to mention how amazing the facial animations are - even better that Mass Effect: Andromeda's... if that's even an achievement. \nAnyway, the reason i sadly can not recommend this game is because of... ah, come on... it's been 10 years, do i really have to say it? The way valve just turned their backs to their longest-running community, the same that brought them to where they are now, is just baffling. Absolutely no recognition for the ten-year anniversary of the community-chosen \"Game of the decade\", ignoring the fans during the 2016 steam awards, and truly a whole decade full of... well, nothing, except for some vague statements and seemingly some lies.\nNow, let's travel back in time together: Back in February 2008, Gabe hyped people up for HL2:EP3 by saying that it would contain \"new paradigmes\" which were \"never seen before\". Of course, this was a meaningful statement. Additionally, Doug Lombardi stated back then that valve would try something \"ambitious\". How did this turn out? ...yeah, exactly. Now please, make yourself an opinion, but, what would make more sense? Making a third game, of which fans hope to clear up everything unclear, even though Mark Laidlaw would have gone the exact opposite direction, or announcing things that never existed and then waiting until the hype dies out because they know they have no idea where the story is headed? \n\nRegardless of the actual truth, due to this mother of all frustrating cliffhangers, which will likely never be resolved, i can not recommend this game. I personally loved this series to death but this ending pissed me so off, it is just unbelievable how valve doesn't even feel the need to resolve this after 10 years. But this sadly supports the argument that valve straight up lied to their own fans.\n\nBut hey, we get a card game.", "timestamp_created": 1501199141, "timestamp_updated": 1503761230, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 116, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820260524749755859", "comment_count": 27, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43515864": {"recommendationid": "43515864", "author": {"steamid": "76561198154397237", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 924, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506804675}, "language": "english", "review": "Still waiting for half-life 3...", "timestamp_created": 1531536556, "timestamp_updated": 1531536556, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 20, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.723048925399780273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44732973": {"recommendationid": "44732973", "author": {"steamid": "76561198117215365", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 48, "playtime_forever": 827, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1506281779}, "language": "english", "review": "Another great sequel.

Whereas [url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/380]Episode One[/url] focused more on under-the-hood improvements and urban combat, Episode Two takes the player through expansive environments with more overt displays of the Source engine's prowess on display, although you're still partnered with Alyx through most of it. It's even a little longer than Episode One to boot.\n\nThis game, believe it or not, was actually my introduction to Half-Life and Valve's body of work. Beforehand, I was content with playing Halo for unhealthy amounts of time. I got an Xbox 360 copy of the Orange Box a couple of months after it came out, and all told it was a great experience. Episode Two is still worth playing today as a great FPS that continued to improve on what made Half-Life 2 great. From a current perspective, it stands firmly between oldschool and newschool in terms of genre-relative mechanics, with a side of driving - again, better than HL2's already enjoyable buggy section. The story, although the third entry in the series since the introduction of actual characters and their plotlines, is compelling...but if you pay more than cursory attention to the world of video games you almost certainly know the ending.\n\nI won't reiterate what most people already know, except to say that it's an abrupt cliffhanger, and that everyone knows about it because it is an unresolved cliffhanger. To be precise, an explicit unresolved cliffhanger that Valve will never resolve, because they decided to sit back and tool around with hardware while making mountains of money off Steam, Dota, and Counter-Strike instead. All of the key writers and designers that would have contributed to planned sequel Episode Three have left the company, with one of them even posting a [url=https://github.com/Jackathan/MarcLaidlaw-Epistle3/blob/master/Epistle3_Corrected.md]plot draft[/url] in the guise of a fanfiction, all but confirming they're done with the series.\n\nIt's safe to say that since Duke Nukem Forever (the game industry's other infamous vaporware product) was eventually released, Half-Life 2: Episode Three has taken its place as The Game That Never Was, and for good. For Valve to spend more than a decade completely ignoring the Half-Life franchise - without so much as a comic to finish the story, a license for another studio to take a crack at it, or even a cancellation - and keeping utterly silent about it being set aside due to their business model shifting away from game development is kind of a slap in the face to its biggest fans. It's not like Episode Three would have needed a super graphics upgrade or a brilliant new gimmick; all it needed was Episode Two's engine and a good conclusion to the story.\n\nIf you don't mind an unfinished story and want to experience a genre classic from a developer's glory days if you haven't already, I'd absolutely recommend it.

[/h1]\n\nOn a blog post from completely out of nowhere, Laidlaw, the brains behind arguably the greatest narrative driven FPS game of all time, released on his blog the final puzzle piece to the great mystery of the mythological Half-Life 3. A letter for the fans to finally settle the 10 year mental prison of confusion all gamers have undergone.\n\nUnfortunately I cannot place the entire letter here as Steam has a certain word limit for reviews (and believe me it is a pretty lengthy letter). Instead what I'll do is place the last paragraph of both versions of the letter here, the first original one with encrypted wording from Marc himself from his blog and the edited version with the names of the characters we all know and love edited by Jackathan on GitHub\n\nThe least I can do as a Half-Life fan and dedicated member of the community is post something here. I deserve no credit for this what so ever.\n\n\n\nThe link to his blog is right [url=http://www.marclaidlaw.com/epistle-3/] here [/url]. currently at the moment his blog is overflooded with traffic which goes to show how big these news are\n\n[url=https://github.com/Jackathan/MarcLaidlaw-Epistle3/] Here [/url] is the GitHub link as well\n\n\n\nFor all new members of the franchise, view at your own risk as this is one of the greatest narratives ever told in gaming. For everyone else, enjoy.\n\n[h1] Epistle 3 (Marc Laidlaw's original version) [/h1]\n\n[spoiler] And here we are. I spoke of my return to this shore. It has been a circuitous path to lands I once knew, and surprising to see how much the terrain has changed. Enough time has passed that few remember me, or what I was saying when last I spoke, or what precisely we hoped to accomplish. At this point, the resistance will have failed or succeeded, no thanks to me. Old friends have been silenced, or fallen by the wayside. I no longer know or recognize most members of the research team, though I believe the spirit of rebellion still persists. I expect you know better than I the appropriate course of action, and I leave you to it. Except no further correspondence from me regarding these matters; this is my final epistle.\n\nYours in infinite finality,\n\nGertrude Fremont, Ph.D. [/spoiler]\n\n\n[h1] Episode 3 (Jackathan's edited version) [/h1]\n\n[spoiler] And here we are.
