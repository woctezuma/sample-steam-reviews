Gman isn't as frequent as in the original one though. I don't really think Half-Life: Blue Shift is any different from the normal Half-Life but with a slightly different set of characters.\n\nThe puzzles in this one aren't as good as in Half-Life 1, they are far more easier than Half-Life 1. The puzzles aren't really good though. They are too easy, but the Half-Life 1 puzzles are sometimes difficult.\n\nThe story of Blue Shift wasn't my cup of tea. Not that bad though, still enjoyed the story a little bit. I didn't feel like Barney needed an expansion or side-story or whatever you want to call it. Anyway, Half-Life: Blue Shift doesn't need a long segment so I'm just going to give a final score.\n\nFinal score: 62%\n\nI did not like it too much but it was still an alright game. Half-Life is a masterpiece developed by Valve, but the 2 expansions were developed by Gearbox. I think a different company other than Valve developing a Half-Life game is the reason it wasn't so bad.

Unlike Half-Life or Half-Life: Opposing Force, Blue Shift does not introduce new game mechanics; rather, it offers a new type of narrative storytelling through constant interactions with an NPC character (i.e., Dr. Rosenberg).\n\nIn this game, you step into the shoes of Black Mesa Security Guard and Clone Template Barney Calhoun, a man whose normal routine of offering beers and guarding doors is shattered with a catastrophic accident that opens the facility to an alien invasion and U.S. Military intervention (a direct result of Dr. Freeman's experiment from the first game).  As Barney Calhoun, you try to survive the alien invasion, protect the survivors, and escape the now doomed Black Mesa Research Facility.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ Good story (NO SPOILERS) that serves as the 'final link' that connects every story (Half-Life, Half-Life: Opposing Force and Half-Life: Decay) of the Black Mesa Incident together.\n+ Constant interaction with an NPC that is essential to the plot rather than for opening doors\n+ The first game in the franchise to introduce 'HD' content during its time\n+ Intense action as can be expected from a Half-Life game\n+ Satisfying puzzles\n+ Adaptive enemy AI, especially with the soldiers\n+ Great level design\n+ Barney can kill dangerous aliens and highly trained military soldiers wearing only a flak vest and an almost transparent plastic helmet as protection (He would be perfect in the Warhammer 40,000 universe as an Imperial Guardsman).\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- VERY SHORT and possibly the shortest game I ever played with only 3 hours of playtime on Hard Mode and Training Tutorial\n- Existence of bugs despite being 14 years old (Particularly a bug where you're unable to move)\n- No new weapons, enemy, or gameplay mechanics.\n- Most weapons from the first game were removed\n- Relatively easy (even on hard mode) as compared to the other games.  In my opinion, it is because acquiring 'armor' and health kits are a lot easier.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\nStory and lore wise, Blue Shift is GOOD but other than that, it does not offer any new content aside from the new player perspective of the overall Half-Life Lore.  In my opinion, Blue Shift is not an expansion but more of a DLC (downloadable content) than anything else, which is not a bad thing by the way, especially one with a good story and fun action sequences.\n\nSo do you buy Blue Shift?  YES but DO NOT BUY Blue Shift alone! Instead, purchase [b]Half-Life Anthology[/b] if you already have Half-Life 2 or get [b]Half-Life Complete[/b]. \n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

It's a beautiful combo!\n\nIf you're fans of the original Half-Life you'll enjoy Half-Life: Blue Shift. Taking me just under four hours to complete. The game is short, sweet, & memorable. The story follows Calhoun your favourite security guard & what he does behind the scenes helping save various scientists while Gordon's busy stopping the alien threat. While not as pivotal as saving the world. Who know's where people like Freeman or others would be if it wasn't for Barney's high regard for life.\n\nWeapons, puzzles, & enemies are of a similar nature to the base game. So you will not find any surprises there.

Released in 2001, 3 years after the original game. The development was handled by Gearbox - who one day would create games like Brothers in Arms and Borderlands. Blue Shift, was in fact their second game, so you could say that Gearbox was still in the process of learning.\n \nThe game consists of 5 lengthy chapters and 3 \"5 min\" chapters. I finished the game in 5 hours, so as you see, it's a pretty short game.\n\nOne thing that i did not like is that the plot did not really collide with the plot of Half Life 1 all that much. There were a few cameos, but overall it felt really separated. Basically, you help a group of scientists fix the teleporter and teleport out of the Black Mesa facility. The only cameo is at the start of the game when you see Gordon riding the train.\n\nGameplay wise, it's basically the same as the original game, except there are no \"Class 4\" Type weapons (gravity guns and such). The game also has a few puzzles here and there.\n\nIn the end though, i like the first expansion (Opposing Force) much more. It had it's own identity i would say.\n\nThis expansion is short, pretty much all assets are reused from the original Half Life, and thematically it just does not do a good job, unlike its predecessor - Opposing Force.", "timestamp_created": 1384961996, "timestamp_updated": 1469976720, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.768792569637298584", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12305668": {"recommendationid": "12305668", "author": {"steamid": "76561197986360343", "num_games_owned": 1019, "num_reviews": 512, "playtime_forever": 7, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412112756}, "language": "english", "review": "Blue shift is, practically, any decrease in wavelength. Oh, wait, it is also the expansion pack (the 2nd one) for the critically acclaimed game Half Life! And this one was also developed by Gearbox. Interestingly, it came more than a year after Opposing Force, the 1st expansion pack, and while that one packed a punch, Blue Shift did not really offer anything new.\n\nSo, there is no real new content here: no new weapons, enemies or new music. But! It is Half Life! And also, you control Barney! The security officer who was bashing the door when you were riding the train with Gordon in the base game. \n\nAnd this is why I liked in Opposing Force, as well. How the new protagonist's story was connected to that of Gordon. You could see a familiar locale in the distance (when in the helicopter in the beginning) or the aforementioned example of the security guard. \n\nIn any case, while Blue Shift did not really offer anything new (graphics-wise it came with a neat high-res texture pack, though), it offered the same cool atmosphere we loved Half Life for.\n\nBlue Shift is a short but all the more entertaining ride!

In this game, you play as Barney Calhoun, a Black Mesa security guard during the time of the original Half-Life's Resonance Cascade, and the subsequent invasion of Black Mesa by the US military in attempt to cover the event up.\n\nThe game is similar to Opposing Force in that it illustrates a part of the world of Half-Life during the time of the Resonance Cascade, though from the eyes of someone other than Gordon Freeman. In Blue Shift's case, you start in a similar environment to Gordon within the depths of the Black Mesa Research Facility as an employee there, and after a casual introduction into basic mechanics and the neat environment Barney works in, you're thrown into combat quickly after the Cascade hits within 15 minutes into the game.\n\nMost of the basic weaponry Gordon has in Half-Life can be used by Barney, from the Shotgun to the Revolver to the Crowbar, and the plot surrounds Barney's attempt to escape Black Mesa and resist against US marines who are pouring in to the facility to cover the whole Cascade up, along the way, you'll solve puzzles, fight baddies, and help scientists to find the way for yourself and others to escape the doomed facility before the impending nuclear destruction of the facility kills your chances.\n\nThe game itself is pretty great; because it was built around the same engine and built around Half-Life as an independent game, it resists many problems itself; most being attributable to those that Half-Life had itself (the flashlight that could stick to surfaces across the room). That being said, the game has a few glitches (saves breaking, certain elevator scenes near the beginning leading to game-overs, Gordon getting stuck on the tram tracks, etc) but none that were utterly game-breaking or capable of ruining the player's experience.\n\nThat being said, this game's main problem is its length and the amount of content it introduces. While Opposing Force, the previous Gearbox Half-Life expansion, had within it a fairly long plot, introduced many new weapons, aliens, and even had a boss battle, Blue Shift is fairly short and doesn't really introduce new weapons, (that being said, most of them to my knoweldge use different skins) and in my opinion, serves more as a compliment to the original game by allowing fans of Half-Life to see more of Black Mesa behind the scenes.\n\nTo summarize: In my opinion the game is great and is my personal favorite of the Half-Life expansions and vies with Half-Life 1 for the best original Half-Life title; I've always enjoyed the character of Barney Calhoun, and I find it enjoyable that there's an entire expansion detailing his own escape from the Black Mesa complex. However, I do recognize the flaws that this game has: This game doesn't introduce as much content as Opposing Force did to be considered a different title from Half-Life, and isn't as long as either Opposing Force or Half-Life to have as much of an impact on the average player post-completion. That all being said, I enjoyed what it was, the narrative and story was solid, and I enjoyed the chance to see the Resonance Cascade and the subsequent invasion of Black Mesa from the eyes of Barney. The game has a certain narrative to it that creates an interesting environment that compliments the plot, and because of its length, you spend more time with other characters and as such are able to more greatly build an understanding of their character because you spend more time together. While it's short and doesn't add much to the Half-Life universe, I myself liked it and found it enjoyable, even if it's only around 2-3 hours long in comparison to the original Half-Life being around 10-12 hours in length.\n\nIn the end, the game's narrative and plot outshine its gameplay for me; it's interesting to see the quest of a security guard escaping Black Mesa while it's under seize by Xen creatures and the military, and the ending is a complete contrast of the ending of Half-Life, and I can't help but feeling like it hit all its narrative marks in those regards.\n\nI myself recommend it, but whether you want to pay 5 bucks for something like this is your opinion in the end.

I think that while still acknowledging that any self respecting Half-Life fan should play through it at least once. \n\nFor one thing the story can be considered very linked to HL2, because its the first Half-Life game that acknowledges Barney as his own character that is separate from every single generic security guard that you come across in Half-Life and secondly the story details how he survived Black Mesa and escaped from it. It's also interesting in that you have a unique scientist character named Rosenberg who has a unique face and serves as a kind of proto-character for the kind of characters you meet in Half-Life 2 in that he drives a lot of the story forward himself and you meet with him multiple times in working together to complete your goal, which is interesting, in that aspect you can see what may have inspired the approach to Half-Life 2 in that regard. \n\nSecondly the graphics have been drastically improved in this, while Opposing Force improved on the graphics a little bit itself this goes the whole nine yards and genuinely does some impressive things with the Gold Src engine of the time. I would recommend looking up some comparisins between the three original Half-Life games to see the progression of graphical capability over the years. Hell when Blue Shift first came out, modders were quite excited just because it would give them access to some really interesting graphical effects not seen before like reflective floors and the like that may seem quaint now when you have mods like Paranoia and Cry of Fear but back than were a pretty huge deal. I still think the reflections and stuff look pretty cool even now. \n\nThe main thing though you need to know going into it though is that content wise its no where near the level of even the original Half-Life, the enemy roster has been down sized quite a bit and for that matter so has the ally roster, exempting some scripted events at least, its also far far shorter clocking in at only about 4 or 5 hours or so, maybe even less if your good, your weapon roster is far less impressive and it makes sense for what is a much shorter game but still, we have to wonder why that all is, why is it so much more lacking in content compared to the others? Well the problem is we don't exactly know a whole lot about Blue Shift's development specifically, there is a little bit of evidence that MAYBE the expansion was planned to be bigger and have a few more features than what we got in an early trailer from back when the game was going to be called \"Guard Duty\" and not Blue Shift: \n\nhttps://youtu.be/vGSgpg3xQME\n\nIn this you can see that originally Blue Shift was going to contain a separate flashlight that you had to equip to use, sort of like Doom 3 which is kind of interesting but other than that I don't know what the original plans may have been. \n\nThe game is still decent and one thing I enjoyed is that you see some beta/alpha skins that have been modified a bit and than re-used for some of the later levels, like the old HEV chargers and health charges that you can find in the older parts of the facility which is a nice touch, there's also the unique way of collecting armor points which fits in with playing a guard where because you don't use an HEV suit you must collect vests and helmets and the like in order to increase your armor points. \n\nIt's not a bad game but its a step down from Opposing Force I think and I think that is how I would sum it up.", "timestamp_created": 1522288476, "timestamp_updated": 1522288476, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684459507465362549", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "14587119": {"recommendationid": "14587119", "author": {"steamid": "76561198019205444", "num_games_owned": 3342, "num_reviews": 321, "playtime_forever": 215, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1320825600}, "language": "english", "review": "Half Life 1 was a fantastic first person shooting game released somewhere around 1999. This Blue Shift is the second rather dull expansion pack for Half Life 1. To be blunt, the first expansion Opposing Force is better, because it offers more guns, new gameplay mechanics and a lot of new monsters. Blue Shift however offers nothing new except new levels that will take you under 4 hours to complete the first time around.\n\nBlue Shift takes you through Black Mesa and Xen once again when everything goes wrong and aliens invade. You start the expansion riding the tram to work (just like Half Life 1) after taking an optional training course that is literally the same training course from Half Life 1.\n\nThe gameplay is more challenging than the original game in both good and bad ways. The good way is the game shows off its artificial intelligence by pitting you... Barney Calhoun, a blue shift security guard at Black Mesa, against hundreds of marines sent into the Black Mesa facility. Usually you fight 10 marines at a time in wide open areas. The enemies will scatter when you throw grenades, run away from you, try to flank you and fan out so you're not shooting enemies like dominoes.\n\nThe negative ways that the expansion is challenging comes from several dark areas with dozens of head crabs jumping at you around every turn. It feels cheap compared to Half Life 1 and Opposing Force.\n\nThere are a few shining lights for this expansion and that is rescuing scientists, although it's not much of a rescue, because any of them can die and it doesn't matter. The expansion also dabbles in having an important character Dr. Rosenburg that you will rescue and he will guide you to the end of the expansion. Guide you as in briefly tell you what to do through believable voice acting.\n\nIn all this is a lackluster expansion compared to the previous one and feels more like a level pack... without levels, just one continuous game.

Sometimes the game isn't even bad, just not as solid as the rest and people act like by proxy it's the worst thing ever. It happened with Fallout 4 compared to Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and I feel like it happened with Half-Life: Blue Shift.\n\nHalf-Life is the second and final expansion pack that Gearbox developed for the original Half-Life, and much like Opposing Force, Blue Shift puts you behind the perspective of another Character during the Black Mesa incident. In Blue Shift, you play as Barney Calhoun, a security guard and familiar face to those who've played Half-Life 2. Much like in Half-Life, Barney is starting his day of work at Black Mesa by commuting via tram, and after arriving at his scattered workplace, he gets his gun and presses a button for some rude as hell scientists in an elevator before everything goes FUBAR. As aliens begin teleporting in from Xen, Barney's elevator crashes into the ground, killing every occupant other than himself. Upon regaining conciousness, Barney sets off on a mission to escape Black Mesa, eventually meeting up with a Dr. Rosenberg, and the two partner up to escape the facility.\n\nOne of the greatest criticisms leveled against Blue Shift is that unlike it's sister expansion, Blue Shift does not add in any new weapons or enemies, without even recycling the ones in Opposing Force. Barney also does not gain access to any of the neater weapons that Gordon Freeman was able to get his hands on like the Tau Cannon or the Hive-Hand, the biggest gun Barney is able to weild outside of console commands being the RPG. While these criticisms are certainly valid, it's not fair to say it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Blue Shift is decidedly much more story driven than Opposing Force, as Dr. Rosenberg is a very important character to Blue Shift's story and is one of the few persistant NPC's in the original trilogy. Dr. Rosenberg explains alot of exposition about his old lab in the facility wile also serving as one of the few charaters with the knowledge and equipment to actually escape the facility. \n\nAs such, the latter half of the game consists of Barney doing various errands for Rosenberg to help calibrate his antiquated teleportation machines, such as going to set up a machine in the border world and restoring the backup power deep below the lab. Even though this may not seem all that important, it really does help Blue Shift feel like it's own experience, which is also accompanied by the game's unique handling of Armor. Barney is the only protagonist of the GoldSrc games who lacks a form of powered armor, so he must use the armor of his fallen comrades to protect himself. This can make the game feel really tense as armor becomes less of a second health bar and more of a finite resource which is found few and far between the last.\n\nThat aside, I feel like the strongest point of Blue Shift is it's level design. The enemy placement and the size of the levels is pretty great, and the Xen levels are honestly really well made compared to the ones in Half-Life. While I'd say Opposing Force has the better gameplay of the two, I feel like Blue Shift's level design is much more consistant than OpFor's. Despite this, the other grave flaw with Blue Shift is it's shortness. Blue Shift seems to end just when it's beginning to get really good, and there's some puzzles in the game that don't make alot of sense initially, like the barrel and TNT puzzle.\n\nAt the end of the day, Blue Shift may not be the best Half-Life game and may arguably be the weakest of the expansions, but it's still a Half-Life game, and it's still just a solid shooter in general. The persistant NPC's in the game as well as the level design and the armor tweaks make Blue Shift still a very positive experience overall, and if you liked Opposing Force or just Half-Life in general, you really should play Blue Shift.

As with Opposing Force and Decay, this game was developed by Gearbox using assets from the original Half-Life. Blue Shift is by far the shortest of the four campaigns, beatable between 2.5-5 hours depending on the difficulty and your experience with first-person shooters.\n\nThis game's initial presentation is very good, but its short traversal and occasionally awkward puzzles put a \"damper\" on things. There are lots of homages to things that happen in Half-Life, Decay, and Opposing Force. The first chapter is really immersive and is a pretty good setup for the rest of the campaign. Unfortunately, Calhoun is relegated to doing the most mundane stuff in the facility, and it really feels like his story is the least important of the four.\n\n****SPOILERS AHEAD****\n\nBecause of the game's brevity, it has to compress things greatly, which sometimes works to the detriment of the game. The difficulty escalates much more quickly than in any of the other campaigns. The second chapter is probably the best, but figuring out what Gearbox was thinking with two of the puzzles (i.e., the weird machines you manipulate vertically and going down an obscured ladder to a completely different area) are hard for me to understand why they were chosen. The third chapter introduces marines and this is where things really get hairy. Unlike every other HL game in my experience, the marines in Blue Shift seem to spam the MP5's grenades the most. It feels artificially difficult because the grenades are very damaging and hard to see coming to dodge.\n\nAlso in the third chapter, there is a bit of an escort mission, which is exceedingly annoying because the guy decides to stop following you because he says he's tired. Sometimes this happens after he says he'll follow you and not take a single step. Other times he'll just rush ahead of you, which is also annoying when he gets in harm's way. One of the funniest experiences I think most people have had with him is him saying he won't go another step when he's right in front of the security door that he's been bitching about getting to.\n\nAnyway, after that chapter, you get sent to the alien homeworld and there's a mess of convoluted mazes. This was also the chapter that I discovered Gearbox's proclivity for constantly placing headcrabs right around 90-degree corners in order for them to almost always get a hit on you just because you couldn't see it coming. I thought this was also pretty cheap. There might be multiple ways to get to the destination but I can foresee people getting confused and frustrated with the random organization of everything. Do you take the left path or the right path? It's a lot of trial and error, I think, and I guess I just got lucky. There's also a really annoying platforming section where you have to basically save on every platform. But once you get past that, there's a kind of extended waterfall section that actually feels like it could belong in the original Half-Life. It's certainly better than the factory in Interloper. This is also where you'll encounter almost all of the enemies that Gordon dealt with on Xen, except far, far fewer. After aligning the machinery on Xen, there's again a bit of a head-scratching moment to figure out where to go. You just jump on some crumbled rocks to reach an upper area, d!ck around for a bit (which feels unnecessary), and then find an arbitrary portal back home.\n\nThe fifth chapter is the longest and in my opinion the most annoying. You have to find a power cell (battery) in a lower section of Black Mesa. Unfortunately things aren't as intuitive as they should be. For instance, you have to use a barrel as a conduit for a broken wire connected to some dynamite and an explosive lever. You also have to lower the coolant levels just to move some barrels, then raise the coolant levels to jump on the barrels to cross to the other side. But the worst offense (and this is the worst part of the entire game) is figuring out the one extremely random hidden button that raises a bridge to cross to a section you probably didn't even see. This is where the game's lack of explanation drove me batsh!t insane. Anyway, once you figure that all out, you charge the battery and send it back.\n\nThe last chapter is pretty easy, you just have to open the damping fields to let the scientists through, then open them for yourself and go through. This is supposed to be tough because of the military guys, but if you know where they're coming from, you can plant a mine and take them out easily.\n\nThis game isn't really all that long but it's decent for what it is. There are definitely some moments that are good but probably an equal number of moments that hit with a considerable clunk. It definitely doesn't have the gravitas of the other HL games and some of its puzzles are more annoying than anything. By far the aliens and military spawn point placement in Blue Shift feels the most d!ckish of all the games. But if you can handle those minor annoyances, it's fun to play. But if you're debating between this and Half-Life or Opposing Force, this should be the lowest on your list because it has the least content and feels less substantial (although Calhoun gets the best ending, in my opinion).\n\nP.S.

His job is simple; main objective: to protect facility equipment and research personnel. He may have Level 3 security clearance into the top-secret Sector B, but don't be deceived - Calhoun is an ordinary guy. But he is about to experience something extraordinary.\n\u2003\u2003The 16th of May started out just like any other day: the halls of Black Mesa are still somewhat empty,  tired staff grumbles their discontent over yet another early morning, the complex has not yet sprung to life. Calhoun is savoring the silence of the break of day; but suddenly something breaks the silence. Gunshots from down the corridor echoes throughout the vacant rooms. Down the hallway the shooting range has fallen victims to its first wielders, confirming the outset of a new day. A few guards steps through the entrance and greets Calhoun, as if just to confirm it further. \n\u2003\u2003For an outsider the halls could be hard to navigate, but for the employees it's perfunctory. A left turn; another left; straight forward and to the right: Barney enters the locker-room. It's mandatory to wear your bulletproof vest at all times, and today is no exception. His locker creaks uninvitingly - as if auguring the imminent event - and it sends his 9mm pistol (it's standard-issue among the wardens) toppling to the ground with a resounding clunk. Some turned their heads, others couldn't be bothered. He picked it up and shifted its weight in his palm. The cold metal sent chills down his spine.

It has good level design but I'm disappointed that it didn't introduce new weapons like Opposing Force did, or even have any of the new weapons from Opposing Force. Also it didn't have any of the Race X aliens. \n\n[spoiler] Another thing I was disappointed about was that there wasn't a G-Man ending but I guess G-Man isn't going to be interested with everyone.\t[/spoiler]\n\nI'd give this game a nice 8/10 even if it was a bit too short.", "timestamp_created": 1483226810, "timestamp_updated": 1483227203, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.577114403247833252", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30883721": {"recommendationid": "30883721", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049020554", "num_games_owned": 3227, "num_reviews": 256, "playtime_forever": 219, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491073676}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life Blue Shift takes place while Half-Life 1 takes place.

The game plays almost exactly like Half-Life 1, with the environment, weapons, enemies, and almost everything being the same as Half-Life 1 (DUH its the same time). There aren't as many creative ways to finish some of the levels and overall Half-Life Blue Shift is a bit less complex and a whole lot shorter.\n\nIf you are a Half-Life fan, this is a great game, especially since it sets up one of the main characters to come.\n\nRating: 8.8/10\nRecommend Price: $2.49 or below", "timestamp_created": 1491073070, "timestamp_updated": 1491073070, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.587301552295684814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23691754": {"recommendationid": "23691754", "author": {"steamid": "76561198162970264", "num_games_owned": 85, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 347, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1500326749}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a fun expansion pack to the original Half-Life game, sharing the gameplay style and features of the original.", "timestamp_created": 1466538487, "timestamp_updated": 1466538487, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.545454561710357666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16922217": {"recommendationid": "16922217", "author": {"steamid": "76561198120642113", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 31, "playtime_forever": 142, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1431833709}, "language": "english", "review": "Not as good as Opposing Force, but worth it.", "timestamp_created": 1436254293, "timestamp_updated": 1436254293, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.575482368469238281", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "33963154": {"recommendationid": "33963154", "author": {"steamid": "76561198008303595", "num_games_owned": 863, "num_reviews": 540, "playtime_forever": 1622, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1501818532}, "language": "english", "review": "A nice return to a classic game scenario, but is far too short and fails to bring anything new to the series.

The goal/story is to escape the incident going on.  It's a good expansion and the puzzles might be much harder than the original game.  A certain bomb puzzle towards the end comes to mind.  Shooting in Half-Life has never been all that amazing mechanically and nothing changes here, but it does set up some satisfying, scripted moments.
