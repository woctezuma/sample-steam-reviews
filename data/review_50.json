With an Laser Sight and fires slightly more faster than the Revolver .\n\nAnd the Sniper Rifle replaces the Crossbow and the Hive hand is replaced by the more useful Shock roach along with Tau Cannon and Gluon gun not appearing but replaced by the more deadly and powerful Displacer Cannon, which is this Expansion's BFG...\n\nYou also fight new enemies in this Expansion with Black Ops Assassins replacing the HECU Grunts from HL1 & Blue Shift since you're playing as an HECU Grunt. And the X-Race who are the toughest enemies who you will fight, and a new Headcrab Zombie known as the Gonomes who are tougher than regular zombies who can throw their guts at you as their ranged attack.\n\nAlong with new Allies such as some HECU Buddies such as the Engineer who can open welded doors and the Combat Medic who is a Portable Healing Station along with some HECU Grunts wielding an M249 SAW ( One of the new weapons that you can use. ) and a new Black Mesa Fat Security guard known as Otis who uses an Desert Eagle instead of an 9mm Pistol.\n\nLong Story short, you're playing as an HECU Grunt to clean up the Black Mesa incident, and things don't go to well and you're forced to fight the Black Ops and you have encountered a new Alien Race known as Race-X but you encounter your HECU Buddies and knowing that they are left behind and forced to fight the Black Ops and the Xen Aliens along with the after mentioned Race-X, you will find a lot of action in this Expansion Pack with some intense action in some chapters. But i'm leaving the important bits out of here.\n\nI have one complain though. Compared to the CD Retail version, the Menu Screen is less cooler compared to the Animated Title with Soldiers marching in the Opposing Force Title with Helicopters flying and Tanks moving to the Right.\nWhat we got is Adrian Shepard and Gordon Freeman holding Flags for the CTF Mode which i don't play ( Since play Half-Life mostly for it's Single Player Campaigns. )\n\nHowever that doesn't hurt what this Expansion Pack brings into Half-Life 1 for it's content. You got New Weapons to play with, New Enemies and Aliens to fight along with new Allies that will help you and a enjoyable single-player Campaign...\n\nAlso this Expansion pack introduces Rope Climbing which wasn't used in future Half-Life games or any other games made by Valve or Gearbox software...

For example, just like any half life game, this one has a tutorial. Gearbox decided to have a bit of fun with it, since you start out in the boot camp.\n\nIt's a typical training mission, but a nicely done training mission.

It's just so much fun to play it's an actual challenge for me to pick between playing either Half Life or Opposing Force.

As I mentioned in my HL review, I wasn't too happy with Half Life's pacing - the environmental changes that were supposed to delay you were all too random-like - it was just obvious that game mechanics with the sole purpose of slowing you down. It was really unreal. Similarly, it kind of bothered me that even though Gordon IS the archetype of the clever protagonist, the man of science who rises and fights back - it's just surreal that every other scientist is older than him, and can't protect themselves at all. Hell, Gordon was more capable of fighting than the guards, employed by Black Mesa.\n\nSo, back to Opposing Force. You play with a soldier (not a bad guy, you don't need to kill scientists if you don't want to) , and your standard gear will be a Deser Eagle and a combat knife - I really liked how realistic this part is compared to Gordon's. The story and the character harmonizes, your character, and even HIS ACTIONS have their part and place in the story. Additionally, claimed by wiki it's his training, Shephard can climb ropes, which is an intresting mechanic in the game, and opens new dimensions in movement and game variety. \n\nAnd at this point I still have 3 great things to say about the game, but they are kind of interlope - \nfirst of all, the game introduces numerous new weapons - M249 (brutal machinegun), Displacer Cannon, Sniper rifle, the already mentioned Deser Eagle and then - New alien weapons! The rocket-launcher-like Spore Gun, the Shock Roach (my favourite) and the Barnacle Grapple.\n\nSecond great thing is partly about Barnacle Grapple - it can be used as a good-ish melee weapon, but it's main usage is just crazy - it can stick to any organic surface, including some pods on the walls, that appeared along with the alien invasion.  You have a grapple that can be used to close distances and move around some parts of the map - it's just brilliant. \nThe Second Great Thing is the creativity of level design. FINALLY the expansion, while being shorter than the base game, uses it's features much more frequently, while inserting these into the game almost flawlessly. There are not only  \"push the box 3 metres to the right to jump\" parts, there is a part when the same box needed to be used 3 times! I guess this is because they knew that after playing the base game, the player will know that they can be moved, and as s/he's accustomed with the feature, can use it in a more varied way.\n\nAnd the third great things is the overall game integrity. It's good, in my opinion way better than the base game was.  There is way less button pressing - once you need to free a medic to take care of the engineer, who can afterwards open a door with a flame cutter. Much intresting than pressing two buttons, isn't it?  Most blockades during the game are legit - a huge worm or pillars of flame in the waste burner(?). Things that delay your progress won't just randomly happen, but your way goes through paths where they delaying elements DO exist, making - at least in my eye - Opposing Force a much more immersive game then the original story.\n\n(On the sidenote - bossfight was less monumental, but far less frustrating than repeadly missing jumps in the shower of electric discharges of Nihilanth)\n\nI won't throw numbers around, but while I felt Half-Life was fun/good,  I *loved* Opposing Force.

Unlike Half-Life however, this title was made by Valve alongside Gearbox Software. Interestingly, unlike Half-Life, the player will see the Black Mesa incident through the eyes of a U.S. Marine(the Military enemies in the first game).\n\n[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers)[/h1]\nThe player takes the role of Commander\u2026(I mean)\u2026Corporal Shephard, a U.S. Marine with the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit who were sent to the Black Mesa Complex for an unknown operation. While en route inside an Osprey to the Complex, Shephard and his team are attacked by Xen air-borne units forcing the Osprey to crash knocking him out. Follow Shephard in his trek across the massive Black Mesa Complex in an attempt to escape while uncovering a government cover-up that would pitch Shephard against U.S. Black Operations Units, Xen forces, and a new alien threat called Race X.\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ New enemy types with unique abilities and weapons (instead of just rehashing the materials of the main game)\n+ Fun and interesting new weapons such as the Displacer Cannon and Shock Roach\n+ Well made action-packed story which shows players a different side of the Black Mesa Incident\n+ Introduction of new game mechanics such as Rope Climbing, Secondary heavy melee attacks, Grappling hooks (Barnacle hook?), Night vision and Portal guns that send you (or your target) to another dimension (See Displacer Cannon above)\n+ Possibly the first FPS game to implement a Military Squad game mechanic\n+ Entertaining Tutorial with cultural references\n+ Story intersects with some important Half-Life 1 events\n+ Good voice acting for its time\n+ Andrian Shephard is possibly a descendant of Jack (protagonist of Bioshock) due to his uncanny ability to wield a Wrench in battle against Black Ops Soldiers and Aliens.\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- Relatively short game with me clocking around 5 hours of game time on hard mode.\n- New squad mechanics is clunky (I can actually forgive this since it\u2019s possibly the first squad mechanic on an FPS game)\n- Puzzles are not that satisfying to solve\n- Final chapter leading to the final boss feels rushed and underdeveloped\n- Unsatisfying and easy final boss\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\nGREAT EXPANSION that I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED specially for those who played the first Half-Life game and I say this because it is littered with several subtle nods from the main game.  \n\n[h1]WORTH IT?[/h1]\nMUST BUY AND MUST HAVE.  I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you do not have it, get Half-Life Complete.\n\n[h1]FINAL NOTES:[/h1]\nOpposing Force is a good example on how to make an expansion; it introduces new game mechanics, new enemies, new weapons and all the while delivering a new story that still being closely related to the main Half-Life plot.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

Instead of playing a Black Mesa personal you are Corporal Adrian Shepard and you are task to hunt down Gordon Freeman and terminate him. You think it would be easy, instead just like the Black Mesa personal you are thrown into the chaos that is wrecking havoc all across the facility and just like everyone else. You must fight your way through the facility and survive. \n\nThis game adds a lit bit of something new to the game. Not only new alien species. But also team effort. Your AI squad mates that are dotted throughout the huge complex. Be warn however there are some instances that they MUST SURVIVE if they die then you will have to start all over again from where you last save. So keep them alive and work with them.\n\nThis game adds more puzzle and more exploration to the huge facility which is always nice. The only minor complaint is the senstivity in some cases it can get really annoying or dizzy when doing these physical puzzles (jump, crouch jump) those sort of puzzles. Unlike in the previous games where the looking senstivity and what not seems more slower. So beware of that.\n\nIf you are a Half Life fan and want a taste of of military action. Half Life style.

The bottom line is this is a great expansion pack.\n\nYou are a marine, Corporal Adrian Shepard sent into the Black Mesa facility after Half Life 1's protagonist Gordon Freeman uh accidentally created a rift in space / time and brought aliens in. Everyone talks to you in the game without cut scenes.\n\nWhen you start the game, Gordon in Half Life 1 is still there and your mission goes from being sent to kill him to fighting for your own survival. You visit portions of the first game yet changed, such as you will visit some of the entry tunnel from the first segment of Half Life 1. You will visit the dam from the original game. Everything changed with new challenges in each. There are plenty of puzzles some are different than the original game and others are more complex. Such as instead of having to use a push box once, you need to use it 3x pushing it from room to room.\n\nI'd say those old environments (destroyed with new challenges) are maybe 1/100th of the map content. The new environments feel fresh and they use a lot of lighting to make it look different. It feels fresh because the other universe is starting to be integrated into our own universe through the aliens making it and because Black Mesa had creature exhibits. There are new textures, you'll go through vine covered sewers where giant fat aliens have their nests.\n\nThere are also new gameplay elements that you will be introduced to in an optional training course. The training course is a very nice tutorial that will show you everything new such as ropes to climb and swing on. It's a very nice mechanic. The flashlight has been replaced by night vision goggles which are very nice. You also have new squad mates to find in the game that will aide you like the medic who can heal you on command, the engineer who will blow torch his way through some doors and your standard commandos. Each of these three will fight intelligently and won't just stand around getting shot. They will defend the territory if you command them to stand there.\n\nThat's another thing the enemy and friendly AI is great as always from the game. AI will run from grenades, throw their own grenades, flank you, run from your fire and other things. It's very nice.\n\nThere are a lot of new weapons. I was surprised. You start with new melee weapons, a new pistol with an optional laser sight, a new sniper rifle that can be quite useful, new alien technology (if you don't want to hear just skip to the next paragraph), such as an electrical gun, a cannon that looks like a BFG from Doom (only more awesome), an acid spitting alien, and a ceiling grabber (yes the enemy) that can be used as a hook shot!\n\nAll the old enemies are here too... but there are a lot of new enemies too (if you don't want it spoiled, skip on!), the new enemies seem to be faster and more dangerous. From waist high creatures that run to you, to taller electric shooting aliens controlled by ant like parasites, giant fat electrical discharging enemies... and their offspring, the list goes on, but you'll be surprised at some of the things the expansion comes up with.\n\nWith a 5+ hour play through the first time, I do wish it was a bit longer so they could divvy out the enemies a bit slower. But hey it's an expansion pack. The graphics are not improved and they still have bugs like getting stuck in the floor of elevators and lifts, but all of that can be overlooked. A lot has been added to make this expansion worth anyone's time.

This game is arguably even better than the original Half-Life in a lot of aspects and in any discussion about Half-Life you will have people who will list this as their all time favorite Half-Life game. It's for a good reason obviously considering how much the game expands upon the formula and mechanics of the first Half-Life. \n\nThe game introduces a ton of new content in all aspects. You have a new alien faction known as \"race-x\" that ramps up the difficulty and challenge in the game a ton and in general this game is quite a bit harder than the original Half-Life so I recommend playing it AFTER you complete the original Half-Life, while the game starts out with just normal Xen enemies once the race-x dudes start showing up you are going to realize how dangerous things have gotten when your trapped in a sewer with the big race-x dudes who shoot giant fucking death balls at you that can kill instantly if you are in the direct way of the ball. The game also expands upon the \"black-ops\" by making them a separate faction from HECU and adding appropriate units to replace what would be marine enemies in the original Half-Life. There is also a great number of more companians available to the player including medic's which in addition to being capable of firing back at the enemy also can heal the player and other friendly units, you have engineers who can cut through doors with their blow torch, and of course just normal grunts who dont have any special ability's per say but usually come with a pretty good weapon like a shotgun or assault rifle. You also have a new security guard in addition to your normal Barney's who's called \"Otis\" and he is a pretty amusing and interesting character to have and, again, spices up the content by adding more variety. \n\nThe arsenal the player is capable of carrying has been drastically expanded upon including two different melee weapons in place of half-life 1's single melee weapon and multiple alien and experimental weapons. A big stand out to me was the teleporter gun which can one hit \"kill\" an enemy by essentially teleporting him to a random location presumably somewhere in Xen, but the secondary fire will teleport you yourself to a random location in Xen that can only be accessed in that way and often contains many resources and a teleport on the other side which will get you back into black mesa at a fixed position that is usually later in the level, which is interesting because it essentially allows you to skip whole parts of levels as long as you have the ammo to utilize the alt-fire. There is also a barnacle weapon which the player can use to grapple across gaps and walls at points as well as latch on to enemies and pull it into its maw which the barnacle will proceed to devour, really creative and diverse weapons loadout for sure. \n\nThe story adds a lot of interesting new lore to the Half-Life story besides just a new alien race by clarifying on the relationship between the soldiers and the black-ops and a pretty disturbing plot point of what happens to the marines who fail to evacuate or are left behind after the order to pull out comes out. It also expands on the character of the G-man giving new insight into his \"personality\" and actions as well as expanding on the ending to half-life by showing what happens to black mesa itself after everything is said and done. \n\nThe multiplayer has also been expanded upon with many maps and game-modes that the original Half-Life simply does not have. \n\nThe only bad part of playing this thing is after playing such an awesome game your going to be tempted to recall the current state of gearbox software and feel a bit of despair at the whole thing. Its like if somebody who you like and highly respected joined a skinhead gang, became a gay prostitute and contracted aids and than went around snorting cocaine and beating up homeless people and stray dogs and puppy's before shooting up an old folks home before blowing himself up and screaming \"hail Satan\" as his last words.

And I'm so used to killing them that every time I encountered a group of HECU marines, I'd panic and start shooting them. Then I'd be like \"Oh. Right\", and pressed the F9 key (my reload last save). At first I didn't mind and let them die, but dammit, they grew on me, to the point I'd truly be attempting to save them. I just felt fond of them. Except for the grunt that pushes the scientist when he's asking for Freeman when you're about to board the Osprey in which you're supposed to escape. That grunt I killed. ALSO, TWO GRUNTS ABANDONED ME IN CHAPTER 11 (The Package). I WENT TO EXPLORE A ROOM AND WHEN I GOT OUT THEY JUST DISAPPEARED. Cunts.\n\nGetting more serious now, something that really impressed me from Opposing Force besides the guns, the Race X and the new \"puzzles\", was the large-scale battles you can have at times. If you take care of your squad, you can have a group of at least four grunts with you. So when you encounter a lot of enemies, the fights are phenomenal! Sadly, this only happened once to me, I was barely able to get three grunts to follow me most of the time because some grunts were just too stubborn and stupid to follow me. This is the strongest flaw I encountered in the game; the grunts' AI is really stupid in the vast majority of the time. And they were also generally pretty useless in battle, and I'm not even counting the times I died because of friendly fire. However, there was one time in which I was able to have an epic Black Ops-Shock Troopers-HECU battle. Replayed it about four times just to repeat the breathtaking sequence. Unfortunately, it was hard to achieve and generally I spent too much time in the game trying to get everyone to follow me, which is simply precious game-time wasted. This is quite disappointing, in my opinion, since the rest of the game is of such extreme quality. \n\nBeing someone who's mostly played modern games, I have to say Opposing Force (as well as HL and BS) looks really good and its graphics are not bad at all for being a nearly twenty year old game. And even if the graphics were terrible (they're decent, in my opinion), the game would make up for it with its fantastic atmosphere, gameplay, battles, bosses, guns, ambiance and so forth. I also adored Gordon's direct and indirect appearances; his \"employee of the month\" photograph (was that his office?), his constant mention by the grunts and finally his Chapter 6 (\"We Are Not Alone\") direct appearance: where you actually see him. I seriously replayed that sequence seven times. I LOVE WHEN GAMES CONNECT WITH EACH OTHER SO DIRECTLY. Thinking that while you're still fighting your way through Black Mesa, Gordon is beating the crap out of Gonarch and everyone (or everything?) else. Opposing Force is, quite simply, a passionate application of creative design. I seriously cannot wait for Tripmine Studios' remake. \n\nDefinitely recommend the game. But as I also said on my BS review; only play it if you have played Half-Life. Otherwise, the game might feel dull to you and you won't understand the storyline, and won't be able to fan-girl over Gordon's appearances/mentions... well... if you're a crazy fan.

The Race X creatures are way better than a tiny headcrabs, and the gene worm is a lot more menacing than a Gargantua, or the Nihilanth (mind you you get to blow up a gargantua) and a PCV suit instead of an HEV suit or an armour vest.

It's set in the same world and environment only this time from the perspective of one of the U.S. Marines of which were the enemy in the original game.\n\nI always enjoyed these add-ons for the different perspectives that overlapping ever so slightly. The detail in these games are great and despite how old they are i still really enjoy them. For me they are quite nostalgic to play, but i imagine maybe for others who are just now coming across these games, they might look a bit crap. With that said, i'd hope that the story would be enough to keep the new audiences interested. \n\nThe game runs great for it's age. The resolution for my screen wasn't compatible but it wasn't too bad, it was still very playable. Unlike my recent playthrough of Half-Life: Source, this one actually had no bugs or anything that stopped me in my tracks. I had no problems with this game from start to finish. Although, this game was a quite a bit shorter.\n\nI sunk about 5 hours into this game and completed it in that time, compared to the original game, which took me a lot longer, this game is fairly short. With that said it's still a great addition to the franchise. As far as mods go, this one was great. \n\nThere are interesting new additions in this game, a few of which i forgot about. New races of alien, new human enemies and new weapons. All of which kept the game interesting instead of it just feeling like the first one. Again, there is never a dull moment in these games as there is always something around the corner. Some of the puzzles in this game impressed me, as they were just as creative, if not more so, then the first game.\n\nAll in all I've definitely recommend this game if you have played the first one and can put up with the old style of the game.\n\n\nTL;DR : A great add-on to the original game, it's old but classic. You play from a different perspective from the first, get new weapons, fight new enemies and it's generally just a lot of fun, although shorter then the original game. \n\n\nFor anyone interested, My Review for Half-Life: Source:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/280", "timestamp_created": 1452364231, "timestamp_updated": 1452383013, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 14, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.682369709014892578", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12340434": {"recommendationid": "12340434", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074479795", "num_games_owned": 213, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 1158, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1412366892}, "language": "english", "review": "Best expansion for a game : EVER!\nI haven't had so much enjoyment playing an expansion pack.

You play as one of the military soldiers that enters Black Mesa, but the twist is that you were never told what you are doing there. There is even a part where you [spoiler]can kill a soldier to save a scientist and get some armor[/spoiler]. It introduces new mechanics such as rope climbing, and new puzzles as well. I highly reccomend this game. There are only a few downsides to this game that I did not find in other games. The first is that, despite the training room and the story making you feel like a soldier, and that in Half-Life, you see soldiers everywhere, here you don't see many soldiers that you actually take into combat until about the second half of the game. Even then, you don't work with nearly the amount you fight at once in Half-Life. They also feel the need to put in black-op's soldiers to fight, which I feel is unnecessary (I mean, they have a soldier-like enemy in every HL and HL2 game. I'm more interested in fighting aliens) but it fits. However, I do not understand why you encounter more Black Ops than your own soldiers.  The only other negative side to this game is that the boss fight is way easier than it is in Half-Life, for reasons I will not share here.

The only new feature that I didn't think was all that well executed was the nightvision goggles. They looked cool at first, but they sadly only really work in short distance. \n\nThis expansion takes place in Black Mesa for the most part, not much time is spent in alien dimensions. At the beginning, I had the feeling that the weapons were a little bit more balanced than in the original game. Because I found myself using the shotgun more often. Still there are some new weapons that I almost never used. \n\nWhat I found special about Opposing Force is that I could see that Gearbox added some more humor in the expansion than what there was in the original Half-Life itself. I still have to say that the story in my opinion didn't really add too much to what we already knew from Half-Life, but it is still fun to see it from their perspective.\n\nThe nitpick I have though is that the thing I loved about Half-Life is that there never really was a moment of standing still where you are forced to listen to someone. Opposing Force had that happen twice, sadly. This was pretty annoying when I died a few times at one of those points. (I recommend quick saving directly after you are done waiting) \n\nThroughout the expansions there were some nice references and they shared the same moments with the original Half-Life timeline.\n\nThe gameplay is the same mixture of shooting and exploration, just like in the original. The beginning first felt a little dull but then the game started to pick up. I especially liked the shooting at some parts, even though I hated one of the new alien enemies who in my opinion was just really annoying, an enemy which requires too much ammo to take down and does too much damage.  \n\nOpposing Force might not be as good as Half-Life, but in my opinion it is still worth to play it if you want to have more of the same Half-Life gameplay.\n\nReviews of the other Half-Life games:\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/70/]Half-Life[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/130/]Half-Life: Blue Shift[/url]\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/id/TrottoirManagerNL/recommended/220/]Half-Life 2[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1468400828, "timestamp_updated": 1470397793, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.664857923984527588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "13680773": {"recommendationid": "13680773", "author": {"steamid": "76561198050503396", "num_games_owned": 181, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 320, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1419812334}, "language": "english", "review": "Is it just me, or did Black Mesa hire a [i][b]LOT[/b][/i] of overweight security guards?", "timestamp_created": 1419828391, "timestamp_updated": 1419828391, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 10, "votes_funny": 44, "weighted_vote_score": "0.596515357494354248", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "17500172": {"recommendationid": "17500172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198089299679", "num_games_owned": 6724, "num_reviews": 357, "playtime_forever": 191, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1439362511}, "language": "english", "review": "This is actually my first time playing opposing force even though i have gone though the regular half life 1 and 2 many times.

For half life this is not the case, the mainstream Half Life story following Gordon Freeman (HL, HL2 and the episodes) can be played by itself and satisyingly goes in its own path no DLC's needed. Opposing Force is a optional story in a different perspective of the Black Mesa incident, including extremely cool easter eggs which link up with the original Half Life and are extremely satisfying. The story is nothing special but it is not bad you follow the perspective of Corporal Adrian Shepard in the military. This is one of the best things about the game, in Half Life you see the military as just souless sponges which soak up all your bullets. But in this game you see this from the militaries perspective and you get some interesting banter with your military allies and the game explains who the black ops soldiers are which make a appearance in Half Life. The game brings a few new guns which are very fun to play with but for some reason there is a very big lack of ammo and near the end the difficulty becomes super hard and I have been playing half life for a really long time on hardest difficulty, the enemies become annoying.

This game, while being about half as long from start to end, is just as good as the HL 1. Maybe even better in some circumstances. It offers several new weapons not found in Half Life, at the expense of a few from HL1 not appearing at all. In addition, not only does Opposing Force have new weapons and level design, it has has entirly new enemy types, mostly for the aliens which you spend most of the game fighting, unlike HL1 where you alternated between military and aliens for most of the game. One of the other benefits is that it doesn't have any real BAD levels. While HL1 had excellent level design, with good mix of shooting,  platforming, and puzzle solving, it also had several moments or levels that fustrated me greatly. From my playthrough of this, I can only really recall a couple of moments that bothered me personally (like the area where if you hit certain explosives you instantly die, just like in HL1 or the final area with the high and strong enemy count). Though it was less the levels themselves and more the enemies you fight. Compared to HL1, Opposing Force throws you against stronger enemies a lot more often, and while it's not terrible, I found it easier to ignore some battles rather than fight my way through. Especially in the final area where they have several rooms that just throw enemies at you with reckless abandon. This does work well for people who wanted a tougher game, but I feel like Half-Life 1 was at a good level of challenge, minus some cheap bullshit it pulled. So I'm not sure if I like the higher base difficulty overall. Another issue is that like Blue Shift, the story is pretty much throwaway. Though, I do appreciate that we see a different view of the situation, even if I think they could have done more with it. (These guys are supposed to go after Freeman, making them like the bad guys killing everything. But then they just turn out to be victims too, which I feel was kind of a cop out) Overall, while there are a few nags I have with the game, it's far outwieghed by the positives of being more Half-Life 1, and the new things it brought to the table. That doesn't even include multiplayer. Yeah, this game had multiplayer. Really odd, but still a nice addition regardless. If you have a spare $5 (or less if you wait for the Valve bundle pack sale) and want more Half-Life, this is an easy yes.
