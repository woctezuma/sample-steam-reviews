Actually, although this is a very technical subject, the developer's commentary that comes with it, is more than worthwhile listening to. It gives quite some insight into how this mini-level was constructed, and even into how HDR lighting actually works. It's not easy to talk about something as complex as this is an easily understandable manner. Fascinating stuff, and for the die-hard Vavle-fans: you even get Gabe Newell's words at the beginning of the commentary ;-).\n\nAfter playing it through for a second time recently - after having left it aside for over five years -  I felt amazed by how lively most of the graphics and - of course - the lighting still look today - a full nine (!!!) years after this level was published. Especially the little Byzantine church, part of the monastery on top of the cliffs, still feels amazing and oozes atmosphere. Valve did a wonderful job with the lighting inside the church, even letting dimmed light through the stained-glass windows.

It is added to every copy of Half-Life 2 on steam.

Gordon Freeman wakes up on a beach with his stuff, he meets an old fisherman who asks him to clear out the Combinate outpost nearby. Our protagonist climbs there eliminating enemies, facing one boss and listening to dev comments scattered around the map. Simple but acceptable side story in my opinion.\nGameplay does not change at all, Gordon still use the same gear, same weapons on the very same way that in Half-Life 2, the one and only change is that some of ways to achieve our goal might become unavailable if you are too slow. To clear the demo you must simply listen to all the commentary and proceed further. Boring but short enough to not make you sleep.\nIn terms of performance the only changed thing is the water and how it looks, all the graphics look exactly like in the base game so do not expect fireworks.\n\nThat is all, a short DLC-like chapter that is not any different from original, it is free so I guess there is nothing to complain about.

We were both very young back then. I just got my first PC, but only played a few browser games on it. My friend however knew this one program [spoiler]which I thought would be illegal at first[/spoiler] called \"Steam\". The dark design of it and the fear of the unknown made me feel like a hacker. The reason why he forced me to download it and create a new account was a special sale, where AMD graphic-card-users would get some games for free. These games were Half-Life 2: Deathmatch and Half-Life 2: Lost Coast. Lost Coast was my first First-Person-Shooter. After we killed every enemy and annihilated the chopper, tried every path, spammed \"E\" at every door in hope that we could open it, we gave up. We played a whole 2 hours [spoiler](!)[/spoiler] without knowing that it is just a showcase of the beautiful Half-Life-engine. But it was great. And it felt great. The scenery was beautiful and we both knew that we would get killed if our parents would find out. Actually, I believe that the fact that we played it secretely made it even more exciting. To hide Steam and both of these brutal amok-games from my father, who checked my Computer from time to time to install security-updates, I created several sub-folders in folders, all with unique categories about \"Pokemon\" [spoiler]yes, I played Pokemon a lot back then :D[/spoiler]. I will never forget the day I started PC-gaming, nor my first FPS-experience. This day will be in my memory for all time. And no, I did not run amok a single time.

The most clear concept that is shown off is the high dynamic range lightning that is now most commonly used in nearly all of Valve's games. \n\nThere isn't much of a story or a narrative in this demo, you're none other than Gordon Freeman, who is stranded on a lost coastal cliff, (The clue is in the title.) that you must climb up to destroy a Combine artillery launcher in a monastery, which is rebelling and attacking a nearby town. Though this is just one massive chunk of a technological demonstration, it has several story elements that didn't make the cut in the final game.

Reach notorious hidden objectives, slay the hidden spider queen, and many more.\n\nActually, there aren't any achievements in the game.\n\n[b]Price:[/b] Half-Life 2: Lost Coast is priced at $39.99, for the stand alone game, it's crazy, isn't it? Imagine how much fun you could have with a game from 2005 for $39.99? I think that's a solid price, I think Valve could get away with charging an extra hundred dollars for the game and it would still be worth it.\n\nActually, it's part of a bundle with 9 other games within the \u201cBuy Half-Life Complete\u201d.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b] To quickly recap, the story was short and not really relevant, since this was taken out of Half-Life 2 (this was supposed to be a section of Highway 17). The Gameplay was identical to Half-Life 2 because it was basically a town in Half-Life. The Achievements were non-existent. The price is non-existent because it comes in a bundle with other games.\n\u201cShould you get this game?\u201d That question is irrelevant, \u201cShould you buy and play the Half-Life Games?\u201d Heck yes.", "timestamp_created": 1439337467, "timestamp_updated": 1439337467, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 18, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.68855750560760498", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23278418": {"recommendationid": "23278418", "author": {"steamid": "76561198013735252", "num_games_owned": 663, "num_reviews": 191, "playtime_forever": 21, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464548070}, "language": "english", "review": "Half-Life 2: Lost Coast was supposed to be a level added into the original game, but for some reason never made it.

It's not available seperately, but it is available in the Half Life Complete Pack (which is on sale right now). Here, you play as Gordon Freeman, as you come across the tiny town of St. Olga, whom is under attack by the Combine with a gun that launches headcrabs into the town. The 14-Minute Tech Demo shows off what the Source engine can really do, and as a result the game looks beautiful. It's almost like a work of art.\n The level is paced very well here. You start by heading upwards on a cliff, where you encounter quite a few Combine soldiers blocking your way. The level has little cover here, so you must be aware of enemy positions and use your grenades well here. You are given a few other weapons along with the Gravity Gun to boost your arsenal. Once in the courtyard, you are allowed to take a small break and take in your surroundings as the game shows off the High-Dynamic-Range Rendering (or HDR Rendering).\n You then enter a church, and one small puzzle later more Combine soldiers enter. You are not allowed to leave until you defeat them all, which is something that wasn't really explored in the original Half-Life or Half-Life 2, so it's nice to see some different gameplay elements here (along with the aforementioned cliff). After you defeat the enemies, you are led outside where you confront a chopper in a very confined area. After that, the level is over.\n Overall, the game succeeds in the one thing it was meant to do: be an excercise in level design and act like a tech demo. This level is the very reason many maps in games such as Team Fortress 2 or the Source Counter-Strike games look so good. However, it's length really shows it's a cut piece of content (cut from Highway 17) and, being a demo, you wish for more.

Made by Valve. So obviously excellent, but I wouldn't exactly go buying a $40 pack for this and this alone if you already own all or most of the other stuff in it. But if you got Lost Coast for free, as I believe I did, then there's truly nothing to complain about, is there?  \n\n   On the other hand, if you're the \"independently wealthy\" type, $40 might be the equivalent of a piece of chewing gum in the back pocket of us lesser plebs, so you may as well just spend that much on a 30-minute \"game\" irrespective. Or you could be more generous and give it to the derelict currently rifling through the trash can on your footpath, if you're that filthy stinkin' rich.  \n\n   OH LORD HELP ME, WHY AM I EVEN BOTHERING TO WRITE THESE WORDS? I think I may have an addiction to game reviewing, this is my second one tonight...\n\nVerdict: 9/10 (as long as you didn't pay anything for it).", "timestamp_created": 1404663541, "timestamp_updated": 1499695002, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.614260673522949219", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37330143": {"recommendationid": "37330143", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025352416", "num_games_owned": 11, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 98, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1320649200}, "language": "english", "review": "engaging short game!", "timestamp_created": 1511529266, "timestamp_updated": 1511529878, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.58442312479019165", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23724401": {"recommendationid": "23724401", "author": {"steamid": "76561197998501462", "num_games_owned": 439, "num_reviews": 50, "playtime_forever": 161, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527443524}, "language": "english", "review": "Short but interesting piece, if you just want a tiny bit of extra half-life content, get this.", "timestamp_created": 1466680634, "timestamp_updated": 1466680634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.616888642311096191", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "23230021": {"recommendationid": "23230021", "author": {"steamid": "76561198173641701", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 51, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1463910206}, "language": "english", "review": "I think this is a good taste of the original game itself.
