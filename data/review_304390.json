As of recently though with the marching fire update the heroes considered top picks are pretty much really strong in some way and are essentially a pick and win in most situations if someone knows what they are doing. That wasn't so bad as with every competitive game, there's good heroes and bad heroes or whatever you want to call them in other games. Until recenty with the new Vortiger update where with it came along a new hero and buffs/nerfs. The so called buffs feel more like nerfs and the new hero is an abomination. Pretty much what they did is take the best moves from everyone else while keeping it simple, so that he has every tool for every situation, they made them safe so only about 1/3 of the cast can punish him, while also making the moves fast and damaging. Lastly they gave him his unique stance which if you are not stunned in some way counters everything while also having a generous window for error. So that leaves you with a hero who is: the best duelist on the game, the best team fighter in the game with amazing feats and the best anti ganker in the game with his safe kit. Actually he is so bad that he straight up completely counters a lot of heroes and the lad doesn't even need that much skill to use correctly. If you call that balanced then you need to see a doctor.

It took me 73 hours to fully unlock everything that is included in the full version of For Honor. While that may seem like a lot, every single hour was packed full of medieval fun and with very little grinding boredom. I also didn't spend a single dollar on the game other than buying the starter edition.\nMany have been turned off of For Honor by its previous peer to peer server system, but ever since they have had dedicated servers, I have only experienced one disconnect, which was when my power went out, so it doesn't really count.\nHere is how the starter edition works:\nWhen you choose a faction, you unlock those heroes in that faction to play so I would recommend researching which faction is right for you.\nEveryone else can be unlocked with 8000 steel each, but while this task may seem daunting, considering you only get about 20-50 steel a match, you can complete orders and community events which can get you hundreds, allowing you to accumulate steel much faster. (Keep in mind, I never spent a single extra dollar)\nEventually, you can get everything that the full game has to offer with time, but much of that time can be spent on one hero, just playing and mastering them, so it doesn't become a grindy mess.\nI sincerely recommend For Honor, the servers are stable, the game is a ton of fun to play and buying the starter edition can save you money, as long as you are willing to experience a slight grind.\nOverall: 9.5/10\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1549517268, "timestamp_updated": 1549517268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.520930707454681396", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49131227": {"recommendationid": "49131227", "author": {"steamid": "76561198294660034", "num_games_owned": 41, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 118, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 71, "last_played": 1550998895}, "language": "english", "review": "A unique game, especially in battle control, is very exciting but unfortunately there are some Heroes who are not balanced or over power", "timestamp_created": 1550721367, "timestamp_updated": 1550721367, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.541984736919403076", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49282655": {"recommendationid": "49282655", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037992970", "num_games_owned": 544, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 27166, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2130, "last_played": 1551858930}, "language": "english", "review": "If you can get past the salt of this game, you can play ANY game.", "timestamp_created": 1551377357, "timestamp_updated": 1551377357, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540481388568878174", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49077693": {"recommendationid": "49077693", "author": {"steamid": "76561198890893230", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 7929, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 974, "last_played": 1551520341}, "language": "english", "review": "Just Dodge lmao", "timestamp_created": 1550515142, "timestamp_updated": 1550515142, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.527027010917663574", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49228898": {"recommendationid": "49228898", "author": {"steamid": "76561198028432160", "num_games_owned": 284, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 20706, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2918, "last_played": 1551877363}, "language": "english", "review": "10 tenebris rising out of 10", "timestamp_created": 1551097993, "timestamp_updated": 1551097993, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.540069699287414551", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49284638": {"recommendationid": "49284638", "author": {"steamid": "76561198100270820", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 6124, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 234, "last_played": 1551657145}, "language": "english", "review": "It's a great game, if you think its a standard fighting game.

With multiple character releases in the coming months there are going to be a host of un properly tested characters charging round pay to win.\n\nTook this from someone else's post which gives you an idea of what I am talking about with new release characters... I hope he doesn't mind but the more people who read this the better imo. \n\n1) Players who bought the product will experience several weeks (or possibly months worth) of positive behavioral conditioning. This serves many obvious functions, such as maintaining customer loyalty and longevity, among other things.\n\n2) Players who have not received the product will experience a series of negative setbacks. Activision games in particular (and, most likely, Ubisoft) design their matchmaking to pair players that have the DLC against players who do not own the same product. By exposing those players to the new product (and thereby losing to them due to either unfamiliarity or a product being overtuned on release), the general sales goal is that they become encouraged to purchase the product. It's generally very successful and perfectly reasonable if your goal is to meet investor demand. It sucks if you're a consumer.\n\n3) Eventually, the product is adjusted to \"meet consumer demands\". These are basically balance fixes. The ultimate goal of this, however, is not to actually fix the gameplay aspects of the formerly overtuned product, nor is it to satisfy any community outcries or complaints. The true sales goal is to repeat the same monetization technique on the next character when that product becomes available. The monetization technique is obviously less effective if the previous character before it is just as overtuned. Many potential consumers will remain satisfied with the old product, and you lose a great many sales in this event.\n\nIn any case, don't take the developers lightly. They're hyper-aware of these scenarios, especially Ubisoft's developers. They always know six months in advance just how much consumer outcry will be produced by an overtuned product, but will always do nothing to address it because they have no reason to. Telling their shareholders \"we care about what the consumer thinks\" is suicide.\n\nNone of this will change or fix itself unless their shareholders pressure them into reanalyzing their products' flaws on the development level. For that to happen, the publishers have to be pushed into a deficit so far that they become desperate, and in that event the game will likely close by executive decision long before they're even given the chance to consider addressing consumer concerns.", "timestamp_created": 1550743868, "timestamp_updated": 1551080940, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 6, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.516891896724700928", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49062633": {"recommendationid": "49062633", "author": {"steamid": "76561197989576468", "num_games_owned": 2732, "num_reviews": 65, "playtime_forever": 9702, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1148, "last_played": 1551840551}, "language": "english", "review": "You get a great campaign with a really interesting multiplayer coop with lots of really cool gear upgrades which looks suuuper badass but the servers are so bad sometimes I just feel compelled to discourage people from playing it.", "timestamp_created": 1550444232, "timestamp_updated": 1550444232, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.542872488498687744", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48808039": {"recommendationid": "48808039", "author": {"steamid": "76561198315847863", "num_games_owned": 40, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 1803, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 187, "last_played": 1551475312}, "language": "english", "review": "Great game :)", "timestamp_created": 1549486184, "timestamp_updated": 1549486184, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48806648": {"recommendationid": "48806648", "author": {"steamid": "76561198121984122", "num_games_owned": 95, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 25258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 782, "last_played": 1551842447}, "language": "english", "review": "Very epic", "timestamp_created": 1549481710, "timestamp_updated": 1549481710, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48787628": {"recommendationid": "48787628", "author": {"steamid": "76561198106576889", "num_games_owned": 92, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 5345, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550287320}, "language": "english", "review": "For Honor Game Developers:\"Hey instead of addressing major bugs in the game, lets just add a Chinese faction!

I also heavily dislike the fact that the kill animations on smaller soldiers were removed, but that's my preference. The way this game does multiplayer also makes me question who got a lot of this games revenue. P2P is not preferred, but acceptable. Dedicated servers are preferred, and easily a selling point. But the fact that BOTH exist is blatant corner-cutting, not to mention that said P2P seems to be required to even get to the main menu. It also is mortifying that most newer heroes are stuck behind colossal price blocks that make it much easier to just buy more DLC (wink, wink, nudge, nudge). Also, hiding an entire mode of play behind a lack-luster DLC that adds four heroes (that's all that's practically there) otherwise. Said DLC costs more than two regular games on this platform combined.

Toxic community and or unbalanced matchmaking\u2026. And here's the thing. The devs can't do anything about the community and its toxicity. The same people complaining about it are the SAME people who are being toxic. These people with hundreds of hours have killed another player spammed the chat in excitement of their victory thats all im going to say on that.  If you goto the for honor tracker website you'll be able to see what's called a fighting scour. And thats whats used when your matchmaking The matchmaking can seem broken. But in reality its a vary in depth calculated system. For example im only rep (lvl) 19 but i'll fight rep 100s purely because my skill lvl (fighting score) is matched with people higher lvl. What can happen is if im with my friends who are low lvl players and we jump into a game. The matchmaking will find a player at my lvl and a player at his lvl. Making it seem like a unfair fight.\u2026 the game has a extremely hard learning curve for new players. Veteran players such as myself who have over a thousand hours\u2026(i'm from playstation) are going to be extremely good and give a huge challenge for new players. This game is like no other. It's not like when you jump from black ops and take your knowledge from that game and use it in games like rage or even destiny. if you get this game your jumping into a entirely new way of fighting, your going to suck and it's going to be hard but for gamers the acompalment is the fun part. Getting that perfect combo and playing mind games with your opponent is extremely rewording\u2026.the Devs put a lot into this game. If you look at where it is and how far its came its impressive. Not perfect but impressive. I will saw that the little amount of currency you receive with each game is extremely low. It's worse than rb6 and its bad over there.

It has come a long way and is pretty polished. It still has some kinks to work out but overall it is a pretty balanced game with more hero reworks on the way.

I am by no means a \"pro\" at this game, but I have put the time in to learn just about what each hero has to offer. If you do that and learn what you can and can not do vs certain heroes the black prior is not an S+ hero. He is very strong, but also fairly balanced for a newly released hero. These negative comments are from people who picked this game up on sale, got demolished and their sad little ego could not handle the fact that this game involves actual skill and time to learn everything.

anyway this has been going on for too long basicly these systems don't work and i have shown why down below.\n\nRevenge:\nwhen the player is being attacked by mulitple oponents depending on how many depends on how fast it goes up and when the bar hits 100% the player can press a button to go into revenge mode this makes the player knock everybody to the floor that is currently attacking and dubbles the players health for a couple of seconds meaning for a couple of seconds you can either run or try to fight the problem with the system is this when its a 5 vs 1 the players 200% health will almost instantly be put down and the player dies anway when its a 1-3 vs 1 the 3 players will just back off and wait 10 seconds and then kill the player meaning that the revenge system is absolutly uselsess.\n\nCombat system:\nthe basic's of the combat system go this any attack no matter how it works can be parry'd by pressing RMB at the right time leaving the opisite player stunned for roughly 1-2 attacks depending on the hero your playing (meaning you could win a game by only parrying and slowly chipping down the enemy player's health)\nyou also have your combo's its pretty basic press buttons in a certain order and combo attacks to make the faster,more powerfull or have special effects some of these combo's can be turned into unblockible attacks meaning that the only thing the player can do against them is parry or dodge or maybe if you are playing one of the many unbalanced hero's your combo's can lead into a stun lock capable of instant killing the weaker carachters in the game.\nthere is also the guard break ability every hero posses it does what you  think it does it stuns the player it is used on for some carachters this means a combo setup for others it just means free hits but dont worry because most high level player counter this move instantly by pressing a button at the right time making it allmost useless.\n\nHero's:\nplease before reading this check the Combat system section for this to make sense.\ni would say only maybe only 5 of the 22 are balanced some of them just stun lock you and deal way too mutch damage others have attacks that are too fast some of them have their parry window in the wrong place and some have attacks that can instantly kill you if you have 25% health doesnt that sounds balanced really the only thing you can do against these hero's is abuse the parry system or muscle memory wich is a slow and anoyying process i am not going to go into every hero in detail because that would take far too long but simple google searches should show you wich ones are unbalanced just make sure you don't going into any bias sites telling you everything is fine and balanced.\n\nside note matchmaking:\nif you are like some people and like to just learn 1 hero maybe because knowing to many hero's is hard to rember or what ever reason just make sure you know that even if you have never played with a hero your praticing your player level decides your opponents not your hero level meaning even if i know no of the new hero's attack i will still be que'd up with highly expirienced players.\n\nAnyway this was my review unless they change the intire game i cannot suggest buying this game but hey who knows maybe you are one of the players who cna ignore all the problems and still have fun if you are i am happy for you but sadly i cannot see what people find so amazing in this game to spend 100's of hours in this\nlong story short: don't buy this unless you are absolutly certain you want this.\n\n\n", "timestamp_created": 1551129324, "timestamp_updated": 1551129324, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525000035762786865", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49056497": {"recommendationid": "49056497", "author": {"steamid": "76561198344514578", "num_games_owned": 15, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 733, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 144, "last_played": 1551329479}, "language": "english", "review": "I'm Gay", "timestamp_created": 1550421582, "timestamp_updated": 1550421582, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.525043189525604248", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48997578": {"recommendationid": "48997578", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999942134", "num_games_owned": 217, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 28805, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 940, "last_played": 1551834622}, "language": "english", "review": "I cannot recommend this game in its current state.\n\nAs much as this game has a LOT of potential, there are just too many mistakes on the developer's part for me to recommend more people to give money to them.\n\nFirst of all, the matchmaking is entirely busted. They reset the 'skill rating' of every player recently for who-knows-why, and now matches are brand-spanking-new players versus the Pro-League Elite. \nFor example: A game I got matched into recently had a Rep 8 player on my team. That's about, 10-20 hours worth of progress. Not good, but starting to come into their own. \nOn the enemy team, they had a Rep 500. That is at /least/ 1,000 hours or more in the game. They should know everything about the main cast and knows how to punish reliably. \n\nFor a game with skill-based matchmaking this is absolutely unacceptable.\n\nTo top it all off, the game's balance is a mixed bag. Characters who are viable trump everything, because most of the cast are old and rotted from lack of meaningful balance updates, and the Wu-Lin are the absolute example of this. They aren't overpowered, but they ran all over the cast until Black Prior came out, who had a chance against these guys. \n\nDo not buy this game. Vote with your wallet, and decide that this piss-poor management of a game is not to be tolerated. Even if you're a player coming over from PS4, it's not worth it. \n\nWill update this review if Ubisoft manage to get their bundle of sticks together.

Below it is the in-depth review. This game has great mechanics, but the developers consistently fail to learn from their mistakes. Some of the most hated abilities in the game get copied-pasted onto new characters. Case in point: black prior is a replica of conqueror. I'm okay with learning to fight around new characters, but there's no reason to replicate what people already dislike and re-release it. Obviously, every game has its annoying characters, but some of the ones in this game really stand out. Matchmaking here is a also science experiment gone wrong. This is a fun product, but it's often immensely frustrating for the dumbest reasons. Play at your own risk. \n\nBelow, you will find a more in-depth list of what I want to say is wrong with this game.\n\nI'll start this off with saying this: I think For Honor has broken a world record for awful matchmaking. At level 6, with about 100 hours of game time, I queued up for a random 1v1. Within the first three seconds, the game threw me into a match. My opponent? Level 192. Game, you did not even TRY to find me someone to play against. You're telling me no human being was playing for honor that was around my level? Really? Add to this that matchmaking sometimes takes forever for reasons beyond me. Sometimes, like the above example, it gives me a quick game. Other times, it takes several minutes to find one other player. And typically, the longer you wait, the worse the matchmaking, because the algorithm becomes less strict the longer you queue. \n\nNext point is the character balance itself. Let me quickly introduce you to a mechanic called hyper armor (which, by the way, I do not think is OP). Put simply, this character effect means that your hero will not be interrupted by enemy attacks during his wind up animation. Think of this as very temporary CC immunity in For Honor. This is typically a trait of heavy characters, usually seen when they throw a slow, heavy attack. So obviously, this tank character mechanic is best applied to the heavier heroes in the game. Except Berserker, who is an assassin, the lightest class of characters...and he has hyper armor on nearly every attack. He's got hyper armor on his LIGHT attacks, which are faster than the tank heroes' heavies. I get the idea of Berserker is that he's supposed to be so bloodthirsty that he's unstoppable, but then why make him an assassin? Why give someone so small so much cc immunity? Just design him as a bigger, slower character to make use of the hyper armor without the benefits of being a fast dodger as well.\n\nCompare that to Lawbringer. He's this Hulk-sized monster in heavy metal armor with a massive halberd for a weapon. He's got an attack where he just lobs a grown man over his head like some plaything. Surely this beast of a knight would have loads of hyper armor to ensure that his slow, heavy attacks have some advantage to them, right? Wrong, he's got hyper armor on one attack that does no damage, but slightly moved the enemy backward. Frickin' Shinobi, a tiny ninja guy who backflips all over the map, matches Lawbringer in hyper armor. They both have it on a single attack. Why? Just why?\n\nOh, and remember that new character I mentioned? Black Prior, who just copied already hated abilities? Picture this: you're playing For Honor, a game where timing and reaction times are critical, where game sense and knowledge can carry the game, and where blocking, parrying, and dodging are crucial components of the fight. You're having a blast with this great combat system! It's a genuinely awesome feature in the game! And then Conqueror comes in. He pressed a button, hits you with a pretty fast, but reactable shield bash, and gets a guaranteed attack afterward. Rinse and repeat, you are spammed by the same attack all game. Frustrating, but one dimensional. You learn to adapt. \n\nThen they release Black Prior. He spams the same thing at you: shield bashes left and right. Okay, you learn to dodge them. But wait! He has another kind of shield bash, but this one flies from another direction and hits you. Now you have to learn to dodge two spam attacks. But wait! He's got a THIRD shield bash! I should mention that none of these can be blocked or parried; you can only dodge. Oh ho ho, but wait! You thought you could dodge?! Black Prior has a special attack, perhaps two, that are specifically built to counter dodges! They track you! So just in case you outplayed the Black Prior on three different occasions, he's got another attack to cover his weaknesses if you dare dodge again. Granted, he has to feint his shield bash, but if you don't dodge, you risk getting hit with the shield. If you dodge, you still get hit. The timing to avoid the damage, whatever it is, is short. Real, real short. Why? Cuz why not, everybody loves spamming, right? Oh, but what's this? You dodged and he failed to throw his heat-seeking attack? Well Black Prior, bless his soul, has a followup attack, that comes after a MISSED shield bash, that is fast enough to prevent an enemy from getting any significant attack in after they outplay him. So even once you've got the dodging shield bash/blocking undodgeable attack comb down, you still can't properly retaliate. Well golly gee, thanks Ubi! No disrespect meant for any Black Prior players, but goodness, this character just is not fun to play against. I get it, he's new, and I get that there are new things to get used to about him, but this is just too much. This game did not need a new character whose kit revolves around spamming the enemy into a corner with unblockable shield bashes. Other character imbalances exist too, obviously. Many people agree Warden's shoulder spam is a little too strong (from both playing him and playing against him, I think he could use a slight nerf), and some of the Wu Lin characters are a dumpster fire that happen to be good at killing things. Not ridiculously overpowered by any means, but certainly annoying.  \n\nTo wrap things up, we've got a solid combat system here with visually interesting heroes, but several weird design choices. Matchmaking is an urban legend here; some say it exists, but evidence sometimes points to it being fake, and no game would be complete without some furious members of the community making sure you get your recommended salt intake for the day when they open the chat window. Again, play at your own risk, and if you do, then do yourself a favor and don't take it seriously like some people do. The toxicity in the community doesn't need to grow.", "timestamp_created": 1549947102, "timestamp_updated": 1550268624, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.502074718475341797", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49081151": {"recommendationid": "49081151", "author": {"steamid": "76561198077697178", "num_games_owned": 589, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 4369, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550525229}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as I really enjoy this game, I cant recommend it.

If you're interested in wasting hundreds of dollars on replacement peripherals after you've inevitably smashed your keyboard, mouse, and controller to pieces, this game is perfect for you. If you enjoy the feeling of blood pulsing behind your eyeballs as you scream until your vocal cords look like spaghetti bolognese, Ubisoft made this game with you in mind. If you love to spend hours upon hours learning the complex ins and outs of a character only to be beaten and BM'd by a kid who just bought the game with the newest DLC and has access to broken characters hidden behind an obscene paywall, well, look no further.\n\nFor Honor is a game built, nay, predicated upon skill, understanding, timing, and practice. Or, it should be. Rather, it is starkly apparent that Ubisoft, true to its business model, is juicing yet another title for that sweet, sweet microtransaction/DLC cash. By introducing fundamentally broken characters that follow exactly ZERO of the \"balancing\" guidelines visible in practically every single Year One hero, the player is met by seemingly superhuman abilities of characters that they would have to either A) Grind for a substantial period of time to acquire the Steel to unlock a character or B) Shell out $30 for a four character bundle, all of which are overpowered in some form or fashion. Most recently, with the addition of Black Prior, this game has become infuriating beyond words. Broken, broken, so broken in fact that many long-time players have reported becoming bored of the character after less than a week, simply because he is so easy to win with.\n\nIf you're looking for a well-balanced, enjoyable game, this is not it.

I've played many matches in that most recent period, and gotten a feel for the changes that have taken place in the intervening time as well as the new champions that have been added.\n\nBut I can't say I had fun doing so.\n\nTwo years have passed since the release of the Centurion and Shaman, and that has apparently not been enough time to fix the issues they had at launch. Being locked in a sequence where you cannot respond and take very large amounts of damage by a Centurion still feels incredibly cheap, and even if you do dodge the first part of the sequence and attempt to punish, don't worry, their light attack will still hit you and put you back to square one. The Shaman's hitbox-defying nature of their leap still exists, and still embodies the most frustrating aspects of playing against Peacekeeper (bleeds, extremely fast lights) and takes it up a notch.\n\nThe base heroes have been changed, most notably and frustratingly by the addition of hyper armor to what seems like at least 50% of all attacks. The most ridiculous application of this comes with the Berserker, who can feint into an attack with hyper armor. In the original rendition of the game, hyper armor was rare and while still frustrating, did not make the game such that your blows against the enemy felt impotent since they could always keep trucking right through your heavies due to so many champions having easy access to hyper armor.\n\nThere are other issues that I have not touched on, such as the imbalanced matchmaking, but the last I will touch on is Black Prior. I realize that BP was just released and as such is in an unbalanced state and tweaks are coming, but the design of it shows that Ubisoft has learned nothing from the complaints about Conqueror. The spam combo of light+shield bash+light+shield bash (repeat) exists in the arsenal of the Black Prior, and is the exact same as the one in the Conqueror arsenal. Couple this with a generally very safe offensive kit aside from this combo, and almost all champions struggle against Black Prior. While hard counters in this game don't really have a place, if all but one or two champions have a very hard time against a single champion regardless of player skill, something is off.\n\nThe thing is, I really want to like For Honor. It is a very unique approach to fighting games that I really haven't seen anywhere else, the animation quality is generally superb, the blows (barring the use of hyper armor) actually feel as if they have some oomph behind them, and I initially enjoyed the game when it was released. However, at this stage, this game unfortunately brings much more frustration than anything else and little in the way of enjoyment even when you do win.

Realistically, if matchmaking is working (lol) let's say you win 50% of the time, and let's say the matches are 5 minutes, it would take 71.4 hours to unlock one single measly hero. Almost three whole days per hero. One single hero out of a huge roster. I hope you're willing to dump 1000 hours into unlocking the core content. \n\nThis is Dungeon Keeper: Mobile levels of ridiculous. It seems intentionally obstructive, to force you to go to the ingame store and buy gold. Another great game ruined by greedy microtransaction bullshit. The gameplay was fun, but the Starter Edition left a really sour taste in my mouth and I cannot recommend it in good faith.\n\nEDIT: I swear it was 6000 gold/hero when I was looking before, but now it's 8000 gold/hero. What on earth? Add another 15\u201320ish% to those times. The DLC ones are even more (which is kinda expected tbh) but I'm talking about base game classes.\n\nEDIT2: Jesus H Christ. I got this during the sale, applied for a steam refund to buy the standard edition aaaand ... the sale ended without my refund coming in and now it's $50. Nobody from Ubi will ever read this but if you do: the \"Starter Edition\" just lost you a sale. I'm taking my refund, and not buying the standard edition. Why on earth would this exist? I didn't even realise I was buying it: I had For Honor on my wishlist, and the wishlist said it was on sale for $10\u2014there was 0 indication I was buying Weird Grift Edition.", "timestamp_created": 1549870932, "timestamp_updated": 1549917175, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.456077158451080322", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49250641": {"recommendationid": "49250641", "author": {"steamid": "76561198291521726", "num_games_owned": 75, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 8990, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2568, "last_played": 1551816963}, "language": "english", "review": "1.

The heroes are WAYY TOO unbalanced. In order to get really good, you have to train for literal hours. The matchmaking system is horrible.

The servers aren't advanced enough to search for players that are on the same skill level.

This game is sure to make you very very mad at times, and less mad other times. Playing with friends isn't fun because of the broken servers, so there goes your multiplayer option.

Everytime this game puts a new character out they will be OVER POWERED AND A LIVING HELL TO FIGHT AGAINST. They have even come out and said we only listen to top tier player base for this game. News flash UBI cucks your top tier player base isnt what keeps this game alive. so now you have the inside scoop on how they think here is a list on why you should never waste your hard earn cash on a piece of shit of a game.\n1. THIS GAME BEEN OUT FOR THREE YEARS AND THERE STILL NO DEDICATED SEVERS AND IF THERE WAS UBI I WOULDNT BE FIGHTING KUNG POW FROM FUCKING CHINA WITH 250 PING IN A RANKED MATCH.\n2.the light spam for characters is un fucking real like nigga who promotes 400 mil sec attacks over and over again and if they are lagging go ahead and drop that down to 300-200 mil sec attacks.\n3. the win rate for characters is uneven asf right now the new Chinese characters are at the top i mean NO FUCKING surprise THERE RIGHT. then you have broken animations for them so you cant tell what they are going to do and to top it off once again they are light spammers all of them.\n4. so in the game there is a class system you have vanguard,assassin,heavy, and hybrid. now lets talk about what makes them different. the big one is reflex guard. so if you dont know what that is ill explain. basiclly in the game you a small directional reticle that shows you where attacks come from and where you need to block. now if you hold the control stick or mouse there you will block. but with assassins and some hybrids that will dissappear over time and that is to add some balance for the fact you have 400 mill attacks. the trade off is you also gain the ability to deflect. what is a deflect you ask its simply a different and more rewarding way to parry and adds more damage to attacks*heavy sigh* SO WHY THE FUCK DO VANGUARD CLASS ALSO HAVE THAT. HOW THE FUCK IS THAT FAIR!\n5.there is a bug in the game right now that has been there since it has came out that if you go for a guard break (GB) at the same time as someone else. if that other person is lagging they will auto get it because for some reason the game rewards niggas that lag.\n6. this is my biggest problem in this game. UBI keeps releasing new characters which is nice right. WRONG! the old characters cant keep up with the new one because they still have a old fighting system in place so which in turn forces you to play a updated character or youll be left in the fucking dust. \n7. the hit boxes in the game are so fucking broken i have jumped over characters when i go to attack. like nigga what?\nIve grown to hate this game it has broke me im done with for honor do not buy this game now or ever they will never fix it.

During my first game, despite my team's point being higher than 1k (which was apparently what was needed to win, according to the in-game tutorial), my team lost, because we got killed and the game wouldn't let us respawn. No explanation was given for any of the victory conditions and events happening. Very unclear and confusing. Also, never got told my character had abilities; discovered them while mashing.\n-Lack of players. The matchmaking queues are really long. Also see the above point about the levels not matching.\n\nIn summary; should you get this game? I'd say no. The game is unclear about how it functions, and isn't friendly to new users.

I'm here to tell you things you could find with a little bit of research, or by looking at just about any other review here.\n\nFor Honor's launch was a mess. It wasn't good. But, since that launch in 2017, the game has been undergoing constant work, reforging, tweaking, and improvement. \n\nP2P? Gone, replaced by Dedicated Servers.\nGame balance is ongoing. It will never be perfect, but it's better than it has ever been.\nTurtle meta has been squashed(mostly). The game is faster and more aggressive than it has ever been, for better or for worse.\n6 new heroes have been added over the course of 2017. 4 new heroes and a new gamemode are inbound on October 16th, 2018. The fact that For Honor survived its horrible launch, its first year, and is now going into its second with an immense content patch on the way should tell you something.\nThe support and love that this game has received post-launch is tremendous. Ubisoft has done their absolute best to correct their past mistakes and create a far better game.\n\nThe game is not easy to play. It is not forgiving to new players. You must invest yourself and dedicate the time into developing the knowledge, muscle memory, and reflexes to become decent at this game. Ubisoft has updated the game semi-recently to include much more in-depth tutorials and training tools for newcomers; utilize them.\n\nFor Honor is a competitive game. You will lose to a lot of things. Loss is part of the game; don't let it get to you. When you've just gone 0-3 against someone in Duel, remember this; Do you remember the last time your opponent messed up? The time before that? Because they don't remember when you mess up. Nobody cares about your losses; you shouldn't either. Take these losses in stride and learn from them. Becoming a better player is one of the most rewarding processes in this game. It's something you will notice in every swing you commit to, every decision you make, and every read you correctly make.\n\nThe game is only going to improve from here.

While that may seem like a lot, every single hour was packed full of medieval fun and with very little grinding boredom. I also didn't spend a single dollar on the game other than buying the starter edition.\nMany have been turned off of For Honor by its previous peer to peer server system, but ever since they have had dedicated servers, I have only experienced one disconnect, which was when my power went out, so it doesn't really count.\nHere is how the starter edition works:\nWhen you choose a faction, you unlock those heroes in that faction to play so I would recommend researching which faction is right for you.\nEveryone else can be unlocked with 8000 steel each, but while this task may seem daunting, considering you only get about 20-50 steel a match, you can complete orders and community events which can get you hundreds, allowing you to accumulate steel much faster. (Keep in mind, I never spent a single extra dollar)\nEventually, you can get everything that the full game has to offer with time, but much of that time can be spent on one hero, just playing and mastering them, so it doesn't become a grindy mess.\nI sincerely recommend For Honor, the servers are stable, the game is a ton of fun to play and buying the starter edition can save you money, as long as you are willing to experience a slight grind.\nOverall: 9.5/10\nCheers!", "timestamp_created": 1523718187, "timestamp_updated": 1523767008, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 711, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.925272226333618164", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30226860": {"recommendationid": "30226860", "author": {"steamid": "76561197999862818", "num_games_owned": 346, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 3199, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1489333926}, "language": "english", "review": "The gameplay is great.

There's a number of balancing issues, but on the whole the core gameplay is robust, challenging, and rewarding.\nSuch a damn shame they wrapped it in shit.\n\nThey've started with the usual triple-A practice where they wrap everything in overly shiny graphics and high-quality cinematics to create the illusion of a whole and worthwhile game. They succeeded very well at this. A lot of the graphics are shiny and detailled, the story is grand and cinematic and well-voiced, and the overall aesthetics are very pleasing.\nBut they fucked up the optimisation to such a degree that the stability and performance of the game are in serious jeopardy.\n\nThe multiplayer framework was a brave and commendable experiment with subtle loadout differences, P2P hosting, and skipping any sort of balancing and connection stability tests. In the rare event that a match is found without people leaving or being kicked, there is a strong likelihood that your opponents will have a subtle but unfair advantage in their loadout, regardless of whether they play honourably or not.\n\nAdditionally, for some reason the Ubiboys saw fit to incorporate a F2P unlock model *within* a full-priced game. You *will* be required to unlock items and heroes with in-game currency after paying full price, and you *will* be confronted with offers to speed up this process with additional purchases. Absolutely disgusting.\n\nThe game overall plays with a lot of intriguing ideas and on paper is incredibly appealing, but in practice the effort in creating it has been extremely poorly distributed, leaving the result a horrible glitchy disconnective yet graphically appealing mess. Assuming you have the latest high-end consumer-slave hardware. If your machine is average at best, the game loses its only defence and becomes worthless.\n\nWould not buy again.\n\nVery poor show, Ubisoft.\nDishonour.\nDishonour on you,\ndishonour on your cow,\na connection error has occured.

It's clearly a futile effort to make it \"e-sport ready\" in exchange of every other casual player enjoyment just to squeeze out as much cash of this game as possible. In other words, typical Ubisoft maneuver. They could just slightly nerf the gear stats of top tier loadouts if they didn't like it instead of completely reworking everything not even asking the majority of community for permission. Yeah, I used a word \"permission\" because every developer who respects their customers would take community's opinion into account. Even the fact that they removed pinned message related to new perk system proves how much they care or rather don't care what we, gamers, think. Every other aspect of the game itself is neat as you can see by just looking at how much  hours of fun it delivered for me and my friends so I guess the title is worth its price, despite this awful combat design decision making that brings everyone's stats to the same level whether it's a noob or hardcore player.

Update.\n\nIts been a really long time since the last review. A lot of time has passed and this game has changed drastically... and yet it hasn't at the same time. The last time I was writing this my feelings were something like this: \"This is a game with great potential, but a lot of designer decisions were odd or strait up wrong\u201d. I hated this game and I loved it the same time. I wrote the review after I got enraged at all the negatives the game threw at me. This time it\u2019s different. After 2 year development, after all of the updates, all of the streams, all that has been done and said about the game - I write this review not because of the frustration, but because of utter disappointment. \n\nThe game came out on 14th February 2017, 2 more months and the game is going to have 2 full years of development under its belt. For a AAA-Company such as Ubisoft, 2 years is enough time to fix every single bug, correct the balance and make an insane comeback to the game market \u2013 same as Rainbow6 Siege did. At least everyone thought and hoped so\u2026 Unfortunately, every single time they take 1 step ahead, 4 steps backwards follow up. After 600+ hours this game feels disappointing and I am going to talk about it furthermore. But before I do, let\u2019s mention what this game gets right and what is the most enjoyable part of it:\n\n+ Visuals: amazing.\n+ Sound design: solid. \n+ Content: not a hole lot in mode department, but I find myself enjoying most of it. In terms of equipment (armour and weaponry) \u2013 lots of it (though I personally wish there would be more stylistic differences instead of just retextured same armour to give it a little bit different looks).\n+ Gameplay: pulls you all in. You will enjoy playing this game, when it works correctly.\n\nUnfortunately all of the pluses don\u2019t matter when developers don\u2019t understand how the game should proceed in terms of balance. They are either stubborn, or strait dumb. It seems they rely heavily on pure data, instead of logic and feedback from the community. Calling Lawbringer a top character just says it all.  \n\n\u201cReworks\u201d Ubisoft did throughout these years made a game much more energetic, yet more frustrating in some departments. \u201cReworks\u201d as Orochi got are just pathetic. The only good rework they did was Kensei\u2019s, while others got faster attacks or shield bashes that no one asked for. There still are A LOT of unfixed issues and bugs within the game \u2013 my personal favourite being ladders. How come they couldn\u2019t fix ladder mechanic for 2 years is beyond my comprehension. \nNew \"Perk\" system costs insane amount of steel, while not giving that much of advantage \u2013 which I personally find just senseless. New heroes added to the game basically break the balance every single time they are being added \u2013 Marching Fire (MF) is no exception. You can say whatever you want, but the biggest part of the community agrees on the fact that Wu Lin are not enjoyable to fight against due to the balance, animations or explicity constant shout-outs issues. \n\nI could go on and on and describe every single problem this game has, but I have just so much space in \u201creview\u201d section. \n\nBasic feeling of the game is \u2013 it\u2019s pretty, but it just doesn\u2019t work right. \n\nCan you have fun in the game? Absolutely! But if you play too much of it you will get frustrated as hell, just because it doesn\u2019t work on so many levels the correct way. \nDevelopers listen to the community and at the same time they don\u2019t. They do reworks that don\u2019t work. They do updates that add 1 thing enjoyable and 4-5 things that frustrate as hell. Personally I think the problem of this game lies in the basic flawed combat system and in Developers themselves. Ubisoft won\u2019t change, and the game's core mechanic won\u2019t change as well. This game won\u2019t change. It will forever be flawed and frustrating. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on the steel costs and loot boxes in this game. Its managable to play without  donating, yes, but you will have to play a lot. And if you want to have a few caharcters with different loadouts, well... I don't envy you. \n\nIf you want to play frequently, sometimes after lunch or 1-2 hours a day in the evening, killing beard-men while looking cool doing it  \u2013 by all means, go for it. \nBut if you think you can enjoy ranked and learn every deep mechanic \u2013 don\u2019t, you will be deeply disappointed. \n\nThis game is a candy to the eyes, but a freaking knee in your crotch. \n\nI cannot recommend this game due to the fact I don't see positive growth from developers. 1 enjoyable thing updated, 4 frustrating things added is not the way to go, and Ubisoft doesn't seem to change its direction.", "timestamp_created": 1498944919, "timestamp_updated": 1544960289, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 224, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.875892221927642822", "comment_count": 19, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "40230121": {"recommendationid": "40230121", "author": {"steamid": "76561198127668271", "num_games_owned": 256, "num_reviews": 36, "playtime_forever": 87841, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 778, "last_played": 1551823960}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]THIS GAME HAS CHANGED ENORMOUSLY SINCE ITS RELEASE IN FEBRUARY 2017[/h1]\n\n             [h1] Read the changes below if you want to know how the game is TODAY[/h1]\n\nWhen For Honor first released it was buggy, and its P2P architecture creating numerous issues, and to top that off heroes were either completely overpowered or useless, meaning that you only saw two or three heroes per match since those were basically easy wins. And the cherry on top of all of this was poor communication from the developers, creating a feeling among players that this was just a money grab. I've been playing since Day 1, and I can tell you that the game has made numerous changes, and all are for the betterment of the game.\n\n\nSince 2017 the For Honor Team has done the following:\n\n[list]\n    [*] Added Dedicated Servers (NO MORE LAG/HOST MIGRATION, Also allows for team shuffling and increasing stability)\n    [*] Rebalanced 3 heroes, and done complete overhauls of 2. Done numerous adjustments to the entire cast\n    [*] Fixed the turtle meta (This is basically where people don't throw out attacks and just focus on parrying and parry counters, which leads to you staring at your opponent for long periods of time where they do nothing.)\n    [*] Added tons of new outfits, emotes, and executions\n    [*] Implementing a new Arena Mode which allows for new players to learn basic and advanced tactics in For Honor, also allows players to practice against/with certain combos, and see their stamina usage and damage\n    [*] Halloween Event with a mask, emote, and limited time gear (Werewolf Emote)\n    [*] Christmas Event with a mask, emote, and limited time gear  (Snowball Fight Emote)\n    [*] One Year Anniversery Event with a mask, emote, and gear (They gave us a salt emote, fuckin-A)\n    [*] Created the Warriors Den, where the Devs tell us exactly what's going on with the game, and their plans for it.\n    [*] Fixed steel gain to make it easier to gain steel without feeling the grind\n    [*] Rebalanced Gear Stats so creating an OP hero in mode where gear stats apply is impossible to do. (See: Revenge Builds, PK and Nobushi Season 1 if you want to know what I mean)\n    [*] [b]There was never any Pay to Win, you couldn't buy certain gear with certain stats, you had to play to Reputation level 7 (Which took quite a bit of time) to get gear with these insane stats. This wasn't a fix, I just wanted to squash this misconception.[/b]\n    [*] EXP Gain feels much better, but is still a little grindy\n    [*] The Devs do double EXP fests every so often, they also do other various community events\n    [*] COMPELTELY OVERHAULED the faction war, now theres tactical territories, war banners, and troop numbers for each territory\n    [*] Nerfed any problematic moves or combos on heroes, and gave those heroes different tools to work with.\n    [*] Added a new mode that relies on teamwork (Tribute). Basically Multi-Flag CTF that gives buffs (Radar, Damage, Defense) when returned to your base.\n    [*] Changed AFK kick system to make it so you get banned on your first offense (5 days), and your account gets wiped on the second offense. The game knows if you are just in a place with no enemies, or if you are AFK at base, plus, [b]THESE REPORTS ARE REVIEWED BY REAL PEOPLE, MACHINES DONT DO THE BANNING, HUMANS DO[/b]\n    [*] Overhauled the report sytesm to be much more through and specific as to the offense.\n    [*] Added 6 new, unique heroes that all feel fun to play\n    - SOME These characters were overpowered at launch, but have since been fixed (See: Shaman, Centurion, Shinobi)\n    - SOME of these characters were underpowered at launch, but have since been fixed (See: Highlander, Aramusha)\n[/list]\n\nTL;DR: The For Honor team has established consistent, effective communication, implemented Dedicated Servers, added a metric-fuck-ton of new content, and has maintained and refined core mechanics to help welcome new players, and keep veterans interested.

For example, if we take basic game experience as 100% - u're not getting 120% with premium features.

For Honor at its core is VERY fun. No game plays like it, the combat is meaty and satisfying, and the character customization is just indepth enough that it's something you want to keep playing towards. Actual seperate armor pieces with their own paint patterns to customize, not just \"pick a skin\". Unfortunately, everyone unanimously agrees that they wish ANYONE besides Ubisoft had gotten this game. Here is a SMALL list of some of its incompetency.\n\n- The game is plagued by 'defense meta'. Daring to attack first is simply a bad idea because if you get parried from it, you are subject to massive health punishment. Despite ubisofts (extremely slow) efforts, this has yet to be rectified at all.\n\n- What this means is that at high-level play, only characters with extremely fast attack, or very safe physical shoving attacks are viable at all. Which leaves us with a handful of usable characters out of a total of currently sixteen.\n\n- This number is made even smaller by the fact that many of these shove-capable characters cannot GET anything after shoving people, so the actually viable people at higher level come down to about three or four characters. To play a game where you stare at eachother and someone attacks first in the hopes they don't lose. (There's literally only one well designed character in the cast. Gladiator.)\n\n- The \"timesnap\" system WAS a lag compensation system for network play. But Ubisoft removed it because of supposed \"input delay\" worries. Without lag compensation, characters attacks are completely inconsistent in timing. Some characters attacks will hit you at exactly the same time they start animating, making them completely unreactable. This has totally broken network play and Ubisoft continues to say they will not reimplement timesnap.\n\n- Ubisoft's \"public test\" version of the game isn't being used well at all. Almost not at all. In their first iteration, they tried to fix defensive meta with MULTIPLE changes to how the core game operates. That was months ago. To this day they've only really implemented one of those changes.\n\n- When they tried to buff the Raider's running grab, the community noticed during the public test that the Raider could actually grab someone in literally one frame and made it VERY clear to ubisoft that this was a problem. Ubisoft did not listen, and let it go into the live game. Only when a Raider won a ubisoft-hosted tournament by just running around in circles and fishing for run grabs, did Ubisoft finally fix this.\n\n- When implementing certain buffs many people were excited for, for their SECOND Public Test, ubisoft didn't allow players to JUST play duel mode to test it. The only available modes were Tournament, and Dominion. Tournament simply couldn't gather enough players even after hours of matchmaking, and Dominion is 4v4. Not a good place to excrutiatingly test things. So that public test was useless.\n\n- The character Conqueror, started the game at top tier because his shield bash could be chained into a light attack that was too fast to punish him for dodging the shield bash. After they fixed this, he instantly became a bad character because he has NO tricks or good parts of his kit. And then he got nerfed. And then they nerfed him again. And again. And again. And again. Conqueror continues to get nerfed directly or indirectly with almost EVERY patch since his initial fix and he has never been helped. There was a point where, during Revenge Knockdown changes, for whatever reason he was still the only person that could be knocked down by Revenge shoves. Hell, even his emotes got nerfed at some point.\n\n- The character Shinobi had their kick ability nerfed, but ever since then have been given nothing to compensate. In a defense game, shinobi's kit simply doesn't allow them to do anything useful that doesn't get them hurt, and only RECENTLY have Ubisoft decided to help them after months of being useless. With just a tiny health boost.\n\n- The character Warlord was notoriously top tier because he was just good at everything. Everyone knew that tweaks to warlord would have to be EXTREMELY minor at best. Instead, they absolutely nuked it back down to the level of everyone else, leaving us with even less usable characters at high level. Many of these changes were reversed, but.\n\n- Despite their \"efforts\", connectivity has gotten worse and worse and more unstable. To top this cherry off, the rewards you get ONLY update at the very very end of the match. That means that at the end of a long, long match, if the game disconnects because someone left on the victory screen, you lose ten to fifteen minutes worth of experience, loot, currency, and daily order progress. This happens regularily, and often. This is the problem that made me finally quit after so much frustration.\n\n- Ubisoft's current implementation of Ranked mode will destroy this games community. The current idea is to have a tournament for every playlist. So far, they have only implemented the Duels playlist. But already, players in high ranks like Diamond or Platinum have already stated that HOURS of waiting in matchmaking gives them no one. The tournament modes simply can't find four or eight players of their rank searching together. If ubisoft continues to implement Ranked tournament modes, the game will end up with SIXTEEN playlists. To support a small community that can't support the ten playlists the game releasted with. (Only two or three of those playlists are ever populated even now. Playing Elimination or Skirmish modes is impossible. No one plays them.)\n\n- The character Centurion has been notorious in this game since his release. Fighting against him is fine, his playstyle is reasonable. But when he DOES punish his opponent, he locks them into a combo that is almost comparable to Marvel VS Capcom in severity. Many characters can be killed from full health to zero by Centurion. He is the ONLY character that acts like this. Killing you for five to ten long seconds because you messed up one. In 4V4 modes, he also gets a knife that can be thrown to stun you VERY fast. Giving him free kills on anyone he wishes. Patch after patch, Ubisoft seems to nerf him in completely inconsequential ways like ... his stamina or something. Something that does NOTHING about why he's actually annoying. Only recently, months after his release have they tried to be concerned about why he's annoying to people.\n\n- The character Warden began the game at an irritatingly high level because of his shoulder bash mixup. It was a mixup that let him force vortex 50/50's to players even at long ranges. It was nerfed further and further and further until nowadays, it isn't very useful against experienced players. Since then, Warden has sat at middle-tier at BEST, and he's been given nothing to compensate for losing his only good part of his kit. If his zone attack is simply blocked - not even skillfully parried - he gets grabbed for FREE with no way to counter it. This is incomparison to the character Peacekeeper, who's zone attack hits the player BEFORE it animates thanks to the removal of timesnap, and she can cancel it, and she's safe to use it because blocking doesn't punish her.\n\n- The Flicker glitch was notorious for months. It was a glitch that caused moves to look like they were coming from one angle, and then suddenly come from another. A gltich that the entire community hated, and plagued the game for months. Funny enougn, Ubisoft fixed flicker in one of the early public tests, and just didn't bother implementing it for months. Only recently have they actualyl adressed it.\n\nIt feels like they still think For Honor is still in beta. I've run out of space to type, but I could go on and on and on.

Steam had many kingdoms on it. Some were large and very rich. Others were small, and trying to obtain their wealth. In an decently-well established kingdom known as \"Ubisoft\" the king was very greedy. One day a peasant made a discovery. He had spied an island off the coast which looked to be filled with gold. Enough gold for everyone in the kingdom one might even say. So the king gave everyone in his holdings a crate of wood with which to build a boat in order to retrieve their gold. His only wish was for a small 60$ tribute from each person as payment for the wood he had supplied. Before the people set sail they each gave this greedy king his tribute. They then set a course for the island now known as \"For Honor\". Everything looked great as people were pushing off from \"Beta\" pier, where each person's boat was kept. Then as they neared the island things started to go wrong. Some boats sprung leaks and began to sink. Some boats fell apart, leaving their passengers treading water. some boats simply dissapeared as if they had suddenly \"disconnected\" from the universe. In the end most people made it to the island. \"Most\" people. Some people recieved wood full of termites and could never build a boat to begin with. Either way most had made it to the island, but without a boat they had no hope of retrieving any of the gold plentifully piled around the island. But as they were grieving the king mysteriously appeared on the island declaring \"Do not grieve my humble subjects! For a mere 40$ I will give you a 'Season Pass' which grants access to my royal treasure fleet which will happily stow your riches for you. What do you say?\" But the people knew better now. They stored whatever they could in their pockets and swam back to Ubisoft kingdom where they then bought passage to various other kingdoms, never to come back again. Until next year's Assassin's Creed that is.\n\n   Hopefully you enjoyed that very accurate representation of what For Honor is. It is a pile of gold on an island that we can see but can't actually obtain. Ubisoft had the gall to try and sell us a season pass along with a bunch of microtransaction bullcrap after taking not only our 60$, but this amazing game that I know they have hidden somewhere. Before a few minutes ago I was still hopeful for this game. Maybe that's because I didn't seem to be suffering the same lagging and disconnecting as everyone else until a few minutes ago.\n\n   Don't buy this. They don't deserve any more money until they get their act together.\n\nFor Honor Youtube Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4c2KoWsdOEg\n(A bit dated but more in depth about actual issues.

And that's pretty much it.. now for the cons:\n\n_ Gameplay, despite being innovative, becomes overly repetitive especially after 30 hours of gameplay for a full priced game.\n_ Community is toxic, you will meet certain types of players that will infuriate you, you will also meet players that are extremely hypocritical and boastful, often criticizing you with non-sensical profanity.\n_ Matchmaking is broken, new players will often be put against players that have played this game for hundreds of hours.\n_ Characters (or heroes), are absolutely broken. Some of these characters are imbalanced like the shinobi and the centurion. There's also spamming or otherwise known as 'cheese' where people would exploit these characters and repeatedly use the same goddamn unblockable attacks like the warden's shoulder bash, or valkyrie's shield bash then her top heavy attack.\n_ Multiplayer, at its core, is sickening.... and that's the main problem in this game. Servers are broken, so you will randomly lose connection to the server without warning whatsoever and lose all of your hard earned progress during said match. These disconnections will be frequent, i'm talking about a dozen in an hour and it doesn't matter if your NAT type is open or not. They also happen frequently when you play in larger game modes such as dominion, elimination and skirmish.\n_ The game is also grindy... it's not P2W but it is to some extent grindy and requires a lot of commitment. It has taken me the majority of my game time to level up my lawbringer (a character) to prestige 5. And there's gear, cosmetics etc.\n_ P2P networking system. You remember when Call of duty modern warfare used to have P2P servers? For honor has excatly that and is surprisingly worse (maybe more or less). Therefore, there are no dedicated servers whatsoever.\n_ Player base is low.. there aren't a lot of people playing this game anymore (can't blame them). As i am typing this, there are currently 1173 gamers playing this game on steam (mostly veterans or die hard fans). Now don't tell me that people play more in the ubisoft launcher because that's fucking bullshit.\n\nI could go on and on but you guys clearly get the picture (especially with the overwhelming number of negative reviews). There are countless of cheaper chivalry games that you can easily get on steam and are way worth of your time than this piece of garbage.

And you are still thrilled about this concept.\nYou can see flaws and wrong decisions, but you know this is closed beta and theres still months before release. So you dont think about it.\n\nIn open beta you find out, there is nothing new added and much of the game still broken in same way.\nYou think, the lack of content is normal in beta, after all its to test not experience full game content. And that is correct thinking.\nYou think that the bugs, weirdness and no servers are still part of beta. They are about to fix them right? They dont have servers, because its beta not full product, it will be in the game later right?\n\n[b]Then the day comes and it gets released[/b]. You had fun in betas, so full game must be even better. You wanna experience the full load not being restricted by beta boundaries.\nAnd then a truck driving 200km/h strikes into your home and smashes you into next dimension.\nYou see that its exactly same as is beta. \nSame stupid menu.\nSame P2P connection solution.\nSame low rewards for matches.\nSame mods.\nSame boring faction wars.\nBut you jump back to your dimension with your last breath, becouse you still believe in that good gameplay.\nAnd if you close your eyes, the gameplay is good, really fun and good.\nFor the next 30 hours.\n\nAfter the 30 hours you start to realize something. You like your main hero, he is fun, but now you wanna make him unique, to stand out.\nBut you cant, because after 30, 40, 50 hours, your hero will look the same as others. Becouse there no customization variants. Every hero has 3 \"set\" variants which looks kinda same. Want more sets? Try play 70 hours with the same hero, to get 4th set, which is just recolor of the default hero look. Want one more set? Maybe after 90 hours ...\nAfter this time, you would expect to have maybe 10 sets and mix them to make unique look. Not here. No matter how many \"mirror\" matches you will have, you will look the same as the other guy with same hero.\n\nBut but ... the gameplay is still pretty good eh?\nIt was on the start before you played more than 30 hours. After this time, you will face the real problems of game mechanics. \nPeople using certain heroes, using infinity combos which are harder to avoid and if you do, its matter of time, before they will initate this infinite combo.\nBut what about other heroes without these combos?\nAfter the time, new breed of players will appear. These players will stay passive, not attacking you. Because they wait for you to attack and when you do, they parry you and punish you with unavoidable damage. And they will do this until end of match.\nAnd we are not even speaking about people expoliting ways in certain heroes, that allows them to bend mechanics.\n\nAnd if this is not what ruins your gameplay experience, dont forget about Peer2Peer multiplayer system, where errors, synchronization rollbacks and disconnects are more than you would expect in non indie game in 2017.\n\nAnd there you are, you have +- 60 hours of gameplay.\nYou sit there thinking.\nConnection is bad.\nLife improving features nonexistent.\nGameplay is bad and boring.\nAnd then you notice one more thing that you did not notice.\nIngame currency.\nThe slow gaining ingame currency, people can buy for real money and then buy a lot of gear to get advantage in more than half of mods.\nAnd there goes ingame economics being bad.\n\n[i]Now we are on end, you sit there, yelling at your screen, because people exploit the game and its mechanics.

(Bringing a lot of issues with latencies and reaction times)\n- Reputation system with no real rewards.

And FH can be quite intoxicating, especially early on when you are learning the mechanics, and finally pulling off a hard won duel is truly an epic feeling. So what's wrong?\n\n1. Devs aren't fixing exploits. This might appear to be a \"fighting game,\" but it's actually a Super Saiyan Magic Spells game. The community, which is awful, has discovered how to exploit and abuse a few flawed mechanics. Now everyone does it. No patches, and Ubi rarely mentions any hope of a patch. \n\n2. You'd be incredibly lucky if you fought a match where you swing mideival weapons at each other and block/parry with shields. Unfortunately, that almost never happens anymore in FH. Instead, the enemy will have figured out their ublockable, chainable, cheese combo and just do it over and over and over.... and over and over and over and over. Allegedly, you are supposed to be able to dodge these moves. In reality, they are lightning fast, and it's a p2p game. So everyone always does this now, and you're only hope to win is to do it back. Fun!\n\n3. Magic spells, tactical nukes, etc.: FH has a system called revenge, which long story short means if you've blocked enough or been injured enough, you can go super saiyan when the enemy attacks you and it knocks them down. You can now kill them easily. Does this super saiyan transformation have a cooldown? Nope. Once people figure it out, the entire game is nothing but revenge. There are \"feats\" (which are spells) you can use in the 4v4 modes. Including a tactical nuke... er sorry I meant \"catapult.\" Again, FH rarely includes sword fights. Mostly it's super saiyans and nukes. \n\n4. Preposterous Ubisoft p2p. Want to play with friends in a group of 4? LOL! It takes us about 20 minutes to figure out who can invite who, and if it will work. Half of the time on player can't join a friend's invite... but if he invites that same friend, the friend can join. Now multiply that by 4. Enjoy spending 20 minutes grouping only to get into a game, which then disconnects, and guess what? It BREAKS UP YOUR GROUP! This is insane.\n\n5. Full priced game, with immediate expensive cash shop plastered all over every aspect of the single worst UI you will ever experience. Insane grind to unlock even the tiniest aesthetics. Normally I don't care about DLC, Season Pass, cash shop, etc. as long as there are some sort of reasonable limits. But once you've paid full price for this game, then immediately see that 99% of the unlockable aesthetics are locked behind A) an expensive cash shop even though you just paid full price for a AAA game, or B) play the game for 500 hours to unlock a paint color for your armor. \n\nFor Honor is Ubisoft in a nutshell. The core game idea is good, then they seemingly hired people whose sole mission is to make it as unplayable as humanly possible. The worst UI, matchmaking, stability, exploits, and community of any game in years. I ended up getting FH because even though I know Ubi sucks, R6Siege gave me hope. But that appears to be a one-off. If you buy FH for more than, say, $9.99, you are being stolen from and you will regret it. Back to other, functional games now.

Something else has happened too, I don't quite know how to put it into words, but the closest I can come up with is that there's a lack of satisfaction in the matches. You leave feeling more frustrated than when you started. Even if you win a match you leave feeling upset at the game or the players around, whether it was because someone threw you off the map four times or the p2p went out twice (both of those are common place) the experience of playing in itself is dissatisfying.

Put in your time and learn the fundamentals of each hero and how to counter them and you are halfway there. The other half is having people to play with, but there are a lot of discords and other places you can find people willing to group up with you or even teach you.\n\nAt the time of writing, I am around overall reputation 215, and have about 10 to 15+ reps in every hero and I am still learning new stuff all the time. I strongly suggest you check your ego at the door and learn to be humble; accept when you are outmatched or making mistakes and actually make an effort to learn from them instead of playing the blame game. Be patient, make some friends, watch/read some guides if you need to, but whatever you do, dont expect to be a pro overnight.\n\nThe current state of the game one year later is an absolute improvement to how it was at launch. They moved from Peer to Peer to Dedicated servers and the overall stability has improved overwhelmingly. Despite what people tell you, the game is *not* dead (especially at lower MMRs where you will be), although some game modes like elimination and skirmish consistently have low activity as it currently stands. In terms of hero balance, things are only getting better with the developers reworking the original cast of characters to bring them up to speed with the current flow of the game, and the promise of new heroes being introduced to the game for hopefully years to come holds much promise for the foreseeable future of this game. Every thursday there is new content added to the game in the form of emotes, paint and color patterns, symbols, ornaments, executions, effects, and new weapon and armor sets. Needless to say there is a steady stream of patches and new content coming to the game all the time on a regular basis.\n\nThere definitely are tiers of heroes as things stand, *however*, this should be of little or no concern as most heroes should still be viable for the majority of players (hero tiers dont really come into play until you start to reach higher MMRs, and even then with the right synergy you can still make it work most of the time) so just focus on choosing a hero that looks cool and mess around with them to see if you like how they play. Remember, there is no wrong way to play the game as long as you are having fun. Ledging people or throwing them into hazards, using feats, playing certain heroes, ganking, \"deathballing\", spamming certain attacks, emote spamming, whatever it is, dont let somebody dictate to you how you should play. There will always be things people will call \"cheezy\" or \"OP/broken\" but 9 times out of 10 its just an excuse for them to be salty about losing. \n\nI really hope that you consider picking up this game, it really is a lot of fun once you invest enough time into it.

This is less of a problem in 1v1 and 2v2 match-types where skill is the only factor that determines the winner (aside from Meta move spammers). On the other hand, 4v4 game-types are wildly unbalanced by this, as they take gear score into consideration, allowing that maxed out player on the enemy team to near one hit kill you through the magic of min-maxing.\n          As for the campaign, it\u2019s pretty good.

I came to the conclusion that despite the numerous flaws, the most prevalent of which were the general game instability, the lack of a lag compensation system and balancing issues inside what was known as the defensive meta, the game was still worth getting.  As of now, several major patches later, I feel a re-review is in order, as much has changed. I'm going to omit all of the positives I spoke of in the previous iteration and focus entirely on how the problems I noted those long months ago have been addressed. \n\nMonths ago, For Honor switched from a P2P netcode, which worked well for duels but not for any of the 2v2/4v4 modes. to dedicated servers. This was an unmitigated success. Whereas lobbies and matches used to crash endlessly, normally through people quitting out, this almost never happens anymore. For Honor is one of the more stable multiplayer games I've ever played. This went an almost immeasurable way to improving the experience, and fulfilling the potential of, For Honor.\n\nSecond, a lag compensation system was added a while back, and while not perfect (nor indeed necessarily the finished version), has helped bring variation between the attack speeds of different players closer together. Essentially, whereas delayed combo attacks used to appear 100ms faster than intended (500ms lights were showing as 400ms, etc), the maximum benefit one can recieve from doing this has been reduced to 67ms. A very good start.\n\nFinally, the last main criticism I raised of the game back in November concerned the reasonably shoddy balancing, especially as it related to the at-the-time prolific defensive meta. While even then balance was better than it was at launch, if you wanted to truly succeed you were shoehorned into picking from only a small selection of the cast. Nowadays, following 7 successful reworks/buffs, and 1 that was rather pointless (hello, Nobushi), more characters than ever are viable. Thanks to these changes, and the release of two DLC characters (Gladiator and Shaman), many heroes now boast much more potent and fluid movesets than were seen at launch.\n\nIn turn, this increase in the efficacy of many heroes has led to a distinct meta-shift. Gone are the days of excessive turtling, where the only safe way to deal damage was through punishes. Dash recoveries have been standardised across the board, as well as, with the exception of a few heroes, parry punishes. Whereas every parry once rewarded a guard break, which in turn gave either free damage or an outright kill via an environmental hazard/ledge, they now reward a simple light or heavy, depending on what you parried. So now, not only is turtling a riskier stratergy, since more heroes than ever have powerful offences, it is also less rewarding. \n\nThe work this team has been putting out has been of a very high quality. I'm not going to say the game is perfect; it is far from that standard, as many smaller problems still exist. Further, I'm not going to blindly sing the praises of developers for work that should, in fairness, have been done before launch. However, these acknowledgements do in no way diminish the fantastic work they have managed. \n\nThere has never been a better time to start playing For Honor. The future looks incredibly bright, especially with the March of War content releasing in about three months. We already have four new heroes confirmed, as well as new maps, a new castle-siege 4v4 game mode and implied reworks for another two heroes, Warden and Lawbringer.

This is a really great move, it should have been this way since the begining, I had quite some fun yesterday playing with friends but I had way more fun during this year with games cheaper than this one. The \"end game\" is awful, as shown in the \"For Honor: Season 3 - PC Finalists Tournament\". I played against players way out of my league in tournament mode (non existant matchmaking in this mode apparently, had no problem in duel/brawls) and was getting rekt pretty hard but unlike other games where I tell myself \"wow those guys master the game, i'll try to learn some tricks and get better\", here their gameplay seems REALLY boring.\n\nSo still a negative review, if you bought it last year and quit because of the constant DC, give it a try. Playing at a low to medium level is fun, higher is boring. Factions war still make absolutely no sense, one whole year of development to fix a problem (peer 2 peer) that should never have been there in the first place do nothing to improve gameplay, unfortunately.

And like a battered housewife, I keep coming back for more.\nI generally don't bother leaving reviews, but I have not been this frustrated and digusted with a game and it's community since the hideous disappointment that was the new Star Wars Battlefront. In fact, both games have a lot in common, the main things being that while they are both beautiful to look at, the shiny exterior hides the shallow and broken insides.\n\nI played both the closed and open beta for this game (on PS4 and PC respectively), so I knew mostly what I was getting into. And while For Honor honestly has the pontential to actually be a pretty damn decent game, it has too many moments that make you want to smash your face into your monitor.\n\nI'll start with the upsides - like I said, it's very pretty to look at. Not only graphically, but the animations are impressively fluid. Even just going from one light attack on a grunt soldier to another is well executed and feels fun and seamless. There is a slight learning curve, but it's not a huge hurtle to overcome with the tutorials, story mode, and basic practice. The different classes are varied enough to not be too similar, but also easy enough to interchange between them. And I really enjoy all the customizations. While it can be something of a grind to acquire new stuff through leveling, there are plenty of things to unlock, both in level rewards and drops. And when you finally start to get into the groove with your character, it's a thrill to see those kills add up. You feel pretty badass, and the executions never get old.\n\nNow, onto the bad - something pretty much everyone complains about I'm sure - the connection issues. Anytime I try to start a PvP match, I get a message saying the match is full. Really? Oh, thanks for the info. Super helpful. Maybe just... I don't know.. keep searching for a match I won't be immediately booted from? And then there's the error messages. Pre match. DURING a match. Terrible lag (and it ain't my internet, I have 100 mbps net speed). Lag even in local, all AI, no matchmaking matches. WTF? Why? And to be honest... and this will sound a bit silly considering this is mainly a multiplayer based game... I hate playing with people. They tend to be the worst about 90% of the time, and those aren't good odds. Just tonight I was in an elimination match with a bunch of Vikings who did nothing but spam the stupid guard break button the entire time. Technically it's not cheating, but it's basically a cheap, cheesy-ass tactic so close enough. That's just frustrating as hell. And I don't care if I sound butt-hurt complaining about that. People who can only play a game by cheating are sad individuals and I can't see how it can make the experience fun. Maybe I'm the lame one for enjoying a challenge, and beating a game based off my own skill. But I digress....\nI stick to bot matches mostly for that reason. And even there the game has problems. The imbalance is pretty clear when in one match my bot teammates are decimating our oppenents, and the next they're dying instantly leaving me to get ganked by four enemies. Beyond this, the rest of my gripes are pretty minimal. I hate that you can end a match with no loot drop. For pete's sake Ubisoft, even dropping one shitty piece of gear that we could destroy for materials would be better than nothing. But that wouldn't earn them microtransaction money, would it?? I also feel the controls are a bit wonky. Now this might be me, or it might be my use of an xbox 360 controller instead of the keyboard and mouse (gasp!), but I swear to the almighty there are too many times one of my blocks or counters don't register when they should. And it is quite frustrating.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. It had the potential to be different and engaging, but the story is flat and the gameplay is rocky. The Division made me distrust Ubisoft... but I gave them one final chance. I will never preorder a game from them again, and I highly recommend doing the same. They have to learn that they can't make promises, take our money, and not deliver. And in this game, the server problems and toxic community are enough to ruin it for most of us.

Playing dominion is a straight up impossibility at this point, or anything with 4+ players for that matter, add onto that a pile of frame rate drops for no apparent reason and you've got yourself a state this game has gotten to in a rather shockingly small amount of time. \n\nA lot of people have asked me if it's worth buying this game, to which, my response always was \"Get it on sale, but for no more than 20 bucks\", you know, at this point, I truely doubt it's worth even those 20 bucks, since even a Free2play model wouldn't save this one. Not to even mention the upgraded \"editions\" of the game and a 60 dollar(Oh yeah sure) season pass.\n\nThis game looked amazing, but once you take a bite out of it, you will discover the endless stream of rot and worms spewing out of it.\n\nAnd I think, it's time for me to check out right now.", "timestamp_created": 1490023661, "timestamp_updated": 1490023661, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.702939629554748535", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34900681": {"recommendationid": "34900681", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002459257", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 53152, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 878, "last_played": 1551673190}, "language": "english", "review": "I've got a fair few hours racked up on this game, I enjoy it and still play it but I certainly would NOT suggest that anyone buys it.

Samurai are weebs, obviously.\n\n-Hero roster is good. All 3 vanguards are solid (with warden being the least) and the following classes being a little less solid. Most season pass heroes are good too.\n\n-It's easy to pick up the game and start to try to understand, but hard to master.\n\n-Story mode is nice. Not needed, but it's nice they put effort in to just have a little extra single player experience.\n\n-Occasional events with event items and emotes are nice to have as well. Halloween was fucking insane. Skeletons were everywhere lmao\n\nNeutral:\n-The game facades as a fighting game. When you get to 4v4 gamemodes like skirmish, tribute, or dominion, it will feel significantly less like a fighting game. 1v1s still do have a fighting game charm, and many people play 1v1s exclusively.\n\n-The game's community has an honor code that some find necessary and others find shitty and useless. Basically, to some it's a cardinal sin to ledge, gank, pop a revenge buff, or do 1-hit killing moves. Personally, I could care less if there was an honor code or not and I roll with what the other player wants in 1v1s. I dont recommend going by an honor code in 4v4s or 2v2s unless you want the game to be boring as hell.\n-Historical innacuracy can bother some but others won't really mind\n\nCons:\n-Certain characters are broken beyond repair. Shugoki has no openers, but he instead relies on hyper armor (the ability to be hit without staggering) to save his ass. What this results in is a long and turtle-y fight where the shugoki just flies a few light attacks and prays that the enemy tries to attack him so he can get the upper hand. Shinobi is really, really, reactable and his speed makes the game fun, but almost all of his moves can not be punished. It makes it a pain to fight against him. Warlord is probably the least broken of all broken characters, but he has to rely on unlocks to get a significant amount of offensive damage.\n\n-Internet connection is needed for the singleplayer campaign. Why? I have no idea.\n\n-Although dedicated servers have significantly improved connection issues, I feel that there is still a lot of connection issues between players.\n\n-Toxic playerbase. I wouldn't say as toxic as CS:GO, but definitely very toxic. It's easy to look around this, however. Just turn your chat off or ignore morons who make fun of you for playing as Gladiator.\n\nIn conclusion, the game is VERY solid, but its as polished as Newt Gingrinch's testicals.

I participated in two betas had a lot of fun playing the game, despite its connectivity issues. This is the first game I have EVER pre-ordered and I was incredibly excited to play. As I played though, it became clear that there were several things very VERY wrong with this game.\n\nServers:\nI bought this game on PC, and at certain points it was impossible to finish Dominion matches. This is upsetting because this leads to an inability to accumulate rewards and unlock gear, emotes, and executions for your favorite characters. At it's worst, the game was unplayable. Even now, so many months after its launch, the frequent connection issues still persist. If you know anything about Ubisoft games, you'll know that this problem plagues their games frequently. It took many months for Rainbow 6 Seige to sort out its server issues. We can only hope that For Honor will turn out the same, although it is incredibly dissapointing that it has taken this long. The devs have at this point promised a change to dedicated servers rather than peer-to-peer. We'll ahve to see.\n\nGameplay;\nIn the betas, gameplay was phenomenally fun. This is partly due to the fact that it was new. After players became experienced however, it because clear that the best way to defeat your opponent was to let them attack YOU and parry/punish them for acting first. Because the combat is based on the ability to punish on reaction, this has become the only consisten and \"safe\" way to play, which, at higher skill levels, translates to the ONLY way to play. At this point, many characters become 1 or 2 trick ponies, never throwing out certain attacks because they are too punishable. If you watch some of the official tournament footage you'll know what I'm talking about. The devs have promised to give the defensive meta a huge overhaul in the hopes of fixing these issues. From what I've seen, these changes are needed and may help a lot if they are implemented correctly.\n\nNew Content:\nLike rainbow seige, For Honor releases two new playable heroes every few months or so along with a lot of new gear options for each hero. Although this is generally regarded as a great feature, it has inadvertantly introduced one of the biggest plagues upon this game: Centurion. Centurion is a Roman character introduced at the start of season 2. His design was centered around lots of mix-ups and the ability to continually harry his opponent with lots of flashy moves. Unfortunately however, the final product was a character that was much MUCH stronger than any other character in the game. Given the parry/punish meta, we can compare the viability of character based on the gauranteed damage they recieve from parrying an opponent. Some of the cast gets fairly high punishes, able to get off very respectable damage, but Centurion's punishes were ungodly. After being parried by centurion players enter what they un-affectionally call centurion's \"cutscene.\" After being parried centurion gets off a free stab followed by an unblockable punch that knocks the opposing player onto the ground. From this stage, Centurion can initiate a ground stab for massive damage. After the opposing character stands they will most likely be out of stamina and Centurion can continue to wail on them as he pleases. After the inital free stab punch stab though, most of the character will either be left at less than 50% or dead.\n\nPlayer Base:\nI have discussed many of For Honor's major issues, but, as I have stated before, the developers of this game have given lots of feedback and have communicated with the community about how they intend to impliment changes and fixes to lots of these issues. So, given this information, why is this still a negative review? Well, these changes have not arrived yet and there is currently no way of knowing if they will be as satisfactory as they are being made out to be. But more importantly is the fact that the damage of these major issues is already done. The For Honor PC community is currently not large enough to support several of the game modes that the game offers. Deathmatch and Skirmish are essentially dead in that there are never enough players in these game modes to connect to in a reasonable ammount of time. The remaining playerbase then has flocked to Dominion, duel, and brawl, but the game continues to offer daily rewards from playing game modes that you cannot join. The effect this has had on me is the feeling that I am not getting the experience I paid for. While there has been a slight resurgence of the player base recently with the new season, it has overall been on a steep decline since release, and I hightly doubt it will make a full recovery.\n\nDespite all I have stated here, I'm probably still going to be visiting For Honor now and again. The game can still be enjoyable for those wishing to see past its faults, but overall I think this game is really falling short of the potential it had. I would encourage those who read to the bottom to stay tuned and watch as this game continues to envelop, because, despite what I have said, I truly want to be wrong. I hope the developers can fix this game and I truly hope that the player base recovers.

You'll also experience cutscenes that are mostly scilence with small gestures and nodding in an effort to minimise dialogue.Finally you will pick up followers along your journey as a respective faction but with no way to play as them or have other players play as them for some co-op action (The conqueror in the knights story for example).\n\nTHE MULTIPLAYER\nOk so unless I'm the first review you're looking at then you have noticed that THIS SHIT IS PEER 2 PEER FOR SOME REASON AND IT'S FOR A GAME THAT EXISTS IN 2017 AND NOT 2006. This is literally Ubisoft showing us how little they care for their customers and only look at us as mindless cattle just eating thier games just so they can harvest our money. I am only reminded of Pokemon Go when it's 1v2 (you are the 1) and you're blocking attacks left and right, activate your revenge and start kicking some viking tail JUST TO HAVE THE MATCH PAUSE FOR THREE MINUETS because someone ragequit. On the positive side they have little side quests like \"get three kills without dying\" that give you bonus rewards. There is also a battlefield that is divided into a bunch of sections Planetside 2 style and updates every hour or so depending on how well your faction did. Finally the best part about this game is when a game mode says \"High activity\" it takes EIGHT MINUTES TO FIND A SINGLE MATCH.\n\nTHE SUMMARY\n+good gramphrics (graphics)\n+solid combat\n+each class is fun to play\n-story is eh\n-Uplay is a flaming pile of nazi shit in a racist trash can\n-PEER 2 PEER IN 2017\n-SERIOUSLY PEER 2 PEER\n- - - -WHY THE FUCK IS IT PEER 2 PEER\n-Raiders can just spam tackle to win the game\n-the Shugoki are the most overpowered class I have ever seen in a video game\n\nOTHER SHISH\nThis is a random assortment of shit. I loved how the female classes get the same armor as the male versions. Too many times have games with knights given the females g-strings and classified it as \"Full Plate Armor\". The music gets REALLY old REALLY fast. \n\nOverall this game could be a 8/10 with recommended but the peer to peer shit makes it a 4/10 worth ten bucks.\nand of course they are going to carve this thing up for DLC without fixing the major problems.\n\nHONESTLY the ABSOLUTE WORST part about this game is that the whole time you're playing it you know FOR A FACT this game would be so good if UBISOFT DIDN'T MESS WITH IT.\n\nwait until it's on sale\n\nEDIT: Hey what's up guys it's 2019 and the game still gets stuck in long loading cycles, I'll get \"unauthorized game extension detected\" by closing the game then getting penalized for cheating, and it's heavily monotized.\n\nforget the sale bit just don't buy it", "timestamp_created": 1487081964, "timestamp_updated": 1551021502, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 41, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.651759564876556396", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "34165342": {"recommendationid": "34165342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198067361413", "num_games_owned": 77, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 380, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1502621347}, "language": "english", "review": "\"I heard that this game had network issues, but it's a free weekend, so i'll give it a try.\"\n\n34GB DOWNLOAD LATER\n\n\"For Honor servers are unreachable at this time.\"\n\nWell", "timestamp_created": 1502446644, "timestamp_updated": 1502449999, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 431, "votes_funny": 195, "weighted_vote_score": "0.844566106796264648", "comment_count": 18, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29968960": {"recommendationid": "29968960", "author": {"steamid": "76561197979139267", "num_games_owned": 73, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 13502, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1491831378}, "language": "english", "review": "How to cook a very nice meal Spaghetti Carbonara \"For Honor\" edition:\n\n1) Choose any multiplayer game mode and press \"play\"\n2) Go to the kitchen, grap a bowl and mix four eggs, parmasan cheese and some cream to a nice mix.\n3) Go back to your computer, press \"Continue\" on the pop up saying \"Unable to connect.

That's apparently not allowed by Ubisoft and ban's you straight up for a week or more, with no warning.\nYes, I have 100 hours playtime since I finally got it to work - but 3 out of 4 friends still can't play this game. Thats why its still a big fucking \"NOT RECOMMEND\".\nBut if you are willing to pay full price and gamble with wether you're able to play or not - go ahead, be my guest.\n\nLooking forward to the patch saturday to see if they actually fix problems or still leave it broken af.\n\n[EDIT #3]\nAfter patch:\nThe game now begins to fail very hard.\nThe matchmaking now takes even more time to find a game (Dominion).\nThe amazingly unbalanced gear problem, now when everyone is rep level 5+ with maximum gear, makes it 120% cancer for new players to join as they get ganked x 100. \nIt's not enjoyable for new players or new chars.\nThe entire Revenge system is now a joke since EVERYONE has a \"revenge build\" which is just being spammed. No chance for \"non revenge builds\" to take down players without the help of 3 other guys.\n\nThe matches are now being interupted even more frequently. \n\nFinal words : \nDo NOT waste your money on this broken game.\nMaybe one day they'll fix it, add more content, balance the gear and classes.

Lag switchers everywhere, game synchronization errors practically every game, and that to me makes it enough for me to not play anymore.\n\nUnless Ubisoft release a statement saying that they're adding dedicated servers, I don't think I can play this anymore.

This is not a problem in itself but rather the quality of the peer to peer networking is atrocious. There have been frequent examples of entire games crashing when one person leaves the match. This has happened to me as well, and I can attest the frustration of this event. If this was an isolated occurance it could be forgiven. However it is not, and it still occurs, despite claims that this issue has been fixed. This is also icing on the cake considering there are videos of people being able to DDOS other players by finding their IP's due to the peer to peer system Ubisoft has put in place being so garbage.\n\n-Steel drop rate - \nThe steel drop rate for acquiring items is absurdly low. It takes far too long to get a simple amount of steel to get basic items. How to solve this? Why, a simple trip to the good old Ubisoft verified steel shop! For the low, low price of up to 60 dollars you can get however much steel you need!\n\nMy sarcasm aside, the fact that an already $70 game has microtransactions is abhorrent, and the attempted justification for it is even worse. These items may be cosmetic in nature for SOME of them, however champion status is not. Champ status boosts your steel drop rate and your XP gain - which is essential to earning better weapons. Not to mention champion status is a time limited benefit, so you have to keep repurchasing it. And sure you can purchase it with steel, but the exchange rate of steel is geared so that you have to play hours and hours and hours of the game to even see a third of the cost needed to reactivate your champion status.", "timestamp_created": 1491186288, "timestamp_updated": 1491888590, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 98, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.684586405754089355", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42356667": {"recommendationid": "42356667", "author": {"steamid": "76561198243425174", "num_games_owned": 84, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 7009, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "last_played": 1551011109}, "language": "english", "review": "Honestly, don't let the reviews scare you.

Then you will experience some not all of these, the lags, Disconnection(DC), a lot of  errors in connecting to GAMES and PLAYERS(so much of these), cant play with your friends if you have different NAT statuses (i hate this the most) for example your friend has yellow NAT(can connect to green and yellow only) and you have red NAT(can connect to red and green only), you will not be able to play together, for me it is like LOW PRIORITY in DOTA 2 but not the same of course. Yeah thats pretty much what the multiplayer is right now. I can say though that my internet is below average but in games like, dota 2, CS:GO, Overwatch, League of Legends, some MMOrpg's i face minimal issues. yeah thats all i could say. So Cheers guys.\n\nAnd i have played the hell out of the Open beta, and not much have change besides the story which i have not tried yet but i will cover that soon. i hope this can help.", "timestamp_created": 1487060035, "timestamp_updated": 1487121923, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1247, "votes_funny": 31, "weighted_vote_score": "0.680749952793121338", "comment_count": 33, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}}, "query_summary": {"num_reviews": 100, "review_score": 5, "review_score_desc": "Mixed", "total_positive": 13566, "total_negative": 11289, "total_reviews": 24855}}
