Can be hilarious and incredibly fun or deathly frustrating depending on how much time you are willing to invest. \n\nPremise: You are a medieval soldier - a knight, vanguard, man-at-arms or archer. You fight against another team of players in various objective based rounds. \n\nReality: The combat mechanics are, as you might expect the defining part of this game. The character models are able to bend at the hip 360 degrees which makes for some spectacularly ridiculous sword fights among more experienced players (matrix bullet dodge anyone?). However I am not sold on the developer's claim that this is some kind of intentional \"deep combat\" system. It seems more to me like an accidental exploit that was discovered by players and has evolved into the fighting system the game now claims as it's own.\nOnce you grasp the basic mechanics of dodging with the mouse and timing the swings of your weapon and blocks correctly, the game is absolutely a lot of fun and particularly the team based games can be a blast. Some of the objectives include getting a battering ram to the castle gates; repelling a siege on your walls complete with hot oil and ladders you can push off the wall while people are climbing up them; attacking a beach from longboats and rescuing npcs from being burned at the stake(!). There is also a hilarious and brilliantly delivered voice emote/taunt system that you can use to communicate with your own and the opposite team (\"Oh my it seems the peasants have taken up arms!\" \"Is that armour or a dress?\") \n\nConclusion: \nThe combat mechanics are a divisive issue. I personally didn't find it too hard to get to grips with the basics, but once you reach the level where players are purposely glitching their weapons and delaying their attacks by spinning around it becomes overwhelming and a little bit ridiculous. The most ridiculous thing I have ever seen was a character with a spear who jumped up in the air and did a 540 degree spin before bending over backwards at the waist and thrusting his spear, one handed into someone's head while still in mid-air. It was one of the funniest things I have ever seen in the game but also destroyed the illusion for me that the combat system was \"in depth\" or realistic in any way. \n\nIf you have the time to invest to learn the basics and don't mind dying a lot while you are learning, the reward can be some truly spectacular medieval battles with people running around on fire screaming, arrows flying through the air, swords grinding together and catapults shooting boulders over your head as you duel with an enemy. Lots of fun until you are stabbed in the head by someone whose sword appears to be pointing the other way!", "timestamp_created": 1551345360, "timestamp_updated": 1551346905, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.51086956262588501", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48946885": {"recommendationid": "48946885", "author": {"steamid": "76561198272941630", "num_games_owned": 25, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 686, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550159647}, "language": "english", "review": "good!", "timestamp_created": 1549973337, "timestamp_updated": 1549973337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517241418361663818", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49236065": {"recommendationid": "49236065", "author": {"steamid": "76561198115420030", "num_games_owned": 65, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 456, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546891079}, "language": "english", "review": "A game were all you do is run and hold C", "timestamp_created": 1551128268, "timestamp_updated": 1551128268, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.515151500701904297", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49304489": {"recommendationid": "49304489", "author": {"steamid": "76561198096083989", "num_games_owned": 46, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 3772, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 135, "last_played": 1551644305}, "language": "english", "review": "its fun but its not worth 20 pounds bloody hell", "timestamp_created": 1551484659, "timestamp_updated": 1551484659, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.511316895484924316", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49253767": {"recommendationid": "49253767", "author": {"steamid": "76561198318671487", "num_games_owned": 88, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 436, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1514044112}, "language": "english", "review": "Better than For Honor, take notes Ubisoft.", "timestamp_created": 1551223109, "timestamp_updated": 1551223109, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49359259": {"recommendationid": "49359259", "author": {"steamid": "76561198061652845", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 270, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 196, "last_played": 1551636480}, "language": "english", "review": "good", "timestamp_created": 1551724177, "timestamp_updated": 1551724177, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49357911": {"recommendationid": "49357911", "author": {"steamid": "76561198032029922", "num_games_owned": 124, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 253, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1521098287}, "language": "english", "review": "Worth buying for the Filthy Peasant badge", "timestamp_created": 1551718624, "timestamp_updated": 1551718624, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49389842": {"recommendationid": "49389842", "author": {"steamid": "76561198354442410", "num_games_owned": 225, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 402, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 268, "last_played": 1551681455}, "language": "english", "review": "I remember when the idea of physically swinging a sword at an enemy in a realistic fashion and lopping off limbs with ease were the things of fairy tales and imagination. (being oft employed in long sessions of D&D) A time when pretending to be a knight fighting for the Holy Land in enormous all-out siege battles was only to be scoffed at and kicked aside. Well, NO MORE! This game, aside from some old familiar feeling as the game began life as a mod on the source engine, is completely fresh and new from the other games that I have played. The supreme drive in this game, powering you through the game is the satisfying sound of cleaving through flesh so as to rip off limbs as well as the addictive competitiveness of \"being the best in all the kingdom\" at swordplay\u2026 or other tools of death if you're a Lordless heathen.\nI believe the best description of the community can be summarized as this: I was playing through a normal match of team objective and as I left the spawn room, I saw two of my teammates fistfighting. One was lambasting the other about disgracing his mother's fine name while the other fought, in return, for the honor of his son's name. This was yelled out in public chat for all to hear. Our entire team eventually gathered and stood around to watch them in their \"precarious duel\". Our other teammates we're joining in the rally too by betting on who the winner would be and heckling both of them. It was a rollicking good time! Once the other team had met us on the battlefield, they all simply dropped their weapons and watched us as we watched the parley they had with each other, mucking about and not playing the game as was intended at all. It was glorious! \nA ranking system is present in the game to match players based on skill and to also give you something to aspire to and earn during your time in the game. I have many-a-memory of the times during a free-for-all, or even team-oriented gamemodes, that I would corner an enemy and our slog, one-hit-after-another, would drain us of all our energy, hitting and blocking. Eventually someone might've come along and killed us on the spot but it is actually quite common that, if your fight be especially epic, people would just stand aside and watch. This mainly occurs when people are having \"A gentleman's duel\" using fists rather than weapons to show the wretch what it means to be a good Christian! The archers, which, believe me, are present in the game, can be simultaneously annoying and some of the best fun you'll have, depending on who's doing the shooting and what side you're on. There is a wide array of weapons at the player's disposal to use at their leisure. Anything from crossbows, claymores, and double-handed barbarian axes to arrow type, smoke bombs, fire bombs, and you even get to choose which type of shield to use according to your playstyle. There are even throwing weapons like javelins and hatchets. Even the oft ignored weapon in games, flails, make an appearance, TWICE! As a regular flail and a heavy variation. You may also customize your knight's appearance but here's where it falters for me a bit. There is no lack of variation. In fact, there's tons of it. That's not the problem. It's that it's all paid DLC that must be bought in order to acquire the cosmetics. While, for the game's price point and overall fun, this is understandable and, to be honest, a bit expected, it is still regrettable that the plague of cosmetic DLC has had to infect this game too. Overall, I'd say that this game, with friends, is some of the best fun you'll have. In addition, when alone, it is an exemplary choice for showing a test of skill on the battlefield\u2026 if you're using melee weapons like a good boi, that is, hehe.", "timestamp_created": 1551853322, "timestamp_updated": 1551853498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49315103": {"recommendationid": "49315103", "author": {"steamid": "76561198060478143", "num_games_owned": 26, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 319, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 287, "last_played": 1551820212}, "language": "english", "review": "So much fun with friends for about an hour then is very boring.", "timestamp_created": 1551533555, "timestamp_updated": 1551533555, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.490928858518600464", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48857249": {"recommendationid": "48857249", "author": {"steamid": "76561198093361719", "num_games_owned": 35, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2529, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 56, "last_played": 1551582639}, "language": "english", "review": "Mordhau is on steam !!!!!! :))))))", "timestamp_created": 1549665132, "timestamp_updated": 1549665132, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.503419935703277588", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49182814": {"recommendationid": "49182814", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091011626", "num_games_owned": 114, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 2909, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1535141537}, "language": "english", "review": "Very nice game, but the community is small and sometimes it's bugged (especially achievements).", "timestamp_created": 1550919188, "timestamp_updated": 1550919188, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49051839": {"recommendationid": "49051839", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139780439", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 13, "playtime_forever": 1304, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1525017607}, "language": "english", "review": "Chivalry: Medieval Warfare < For Honor", "timestamp_created": 1550406879, "timestamp_updated": 1550406879, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49370135": {"recommendationid": "49370135", "author": {"steamid": "76561198309236229", "num_games_owned": 4, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 29, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 29, "last_played": 1551701314}, "language": "english", "review": "If you want a good sword fighting game, pick For Honor.

It features stunning visuals of middle ages, engaging gameplay mechanics, riveting character classes and powerful weapons that will keep you hooked to your screens. The backdrop reflects a classy Medieval fictional world with similar game aspects that were a highlight of the developer's earlier title, Half-Life 2 mod, Age of Chivalry. \nReleased globally on October 16, 2012, for PC users, the title was extended for Xbox and PlayStation 3 platforms in December 2014. It also comes equipped with a standalone expansion pack called Chivalry: Deadliest Warrior, which was made available for gaming enthusiasts on November 14, 2013.\nThe gameplay involves a civil war between two factions residing in the fictional world of middle ages where you can pick sides amongst four different character classes and use powerful defensive tools to knock down their opponents. You can enjoy playing this cool battle-play title in either first person or third person, win rewards, fight enemies and lead your pack with the help of medieval weapons fit for a war. These include swords, longbows, maces and axes amongst others. Use these to thwack, smash and throw darts at your foes to make your way to the top. Exciting tools like boiling oil, ballistae, a battering ram and catapults are also at your disposal to raid castles, win the historic battle and turn the tides in your faction's favor. \nBuild fortifications, gather ammunition and engage in an objective-based gameplay to grab the top slot in Chivalry Medieval Warfare.", "timestamp_created": 1480227436, "timestamp_updated": 1541538601, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 408, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.96929556131362915", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "5696873": {"recommendationid": "5696873", "author": {"steamid": "76561198054275865", "num_games_owned": 257, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 56763, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1527018745}, "language": "english", "review": "Hello, Chivalry community! \n\nI am Sphynx990, started to play this game since the beginning of its development. I wrote my third guide on how to perform the double jump in the game, to have fun with friends and people, make this game more interesting and funny to play. But, I got a ban from the \"official admins\", which handle chivalry servers. They were quite rude to me, asked me to remove my guide. Since I didn't do anything bad, I said no. I was protecting my player's rights in the game. Today developers removed my Chivalry guide and banned my account. It's not a vac ban, because for my almost 1000 hours I didn't play with cheats. \n\n\nSo, the moral of this case is that people from TornBanner, instead of developing the game, making new content and optimizing it, they just block the content from mature players. I am very disappointed about this case. The admins of the official servers are very bossy and rude people. I can provide the chat if you need, actually, it was in my guide as well. \n\nIt will be great if you guys will support me because I was defending the right of our small community. Today it's me, tomorrow it's you. By the way, the guy who send the report to devs and who gave me a ban changed his avatar and nickname. I think it shows a lot of things about him. \n\n05/27/2018: The official team of developers or moderators denied the appeal. Think twice when you do something wrong in this game, even if you and your friends and community find it normal. TornBanner has its own rules and ideas on how to develop and run the game.

Unfortunately, my computer couldn't run it at the time. Flash forward to when I had a new computer come  May/June of 2013, and I was having the time of my life! Foolhardy, yet visceral combat, amazing voiceovers, and the most in-depth melee combat I had ever seen at the time...it was remarkable. The combat was very in-depth, yet nobody was quite above anyone else at the time. Timing and footing was everything.  My goal as a player at the time was to reach level twenty, and unlock all veteran helmets for each of the four classes. (Keep in mind that there was zero customization at this point in time, apart from switching from default to veteran helmets, which didn't work half of the time)\n\nCome July, I had slaved a hundred hours or more to unlock the four helmets. I couldn't have felt more proud of myself. Then in the next two or so months, they added proper character customization, and snazzy shiny helmets as well. It was amazing to see different colors on the battlefield rather than the old red and blue. I can remember the first time seeing a level 50 player with a golden helmet. A vanguard walking ever so slowly towards me, as if to initiate a duel. I felt pumped, knowing that this battle would be drawn out as I see what endurance and good footing this foe has to-\n\n...d-did....did he just kill me by landing an overhead while not even looking at me?\n\nThat must be some glitch that people might've just discovered. I'm sure they'll patch it out soon. Besides, the Deadliest Warrior expansion is coming out soon! (Circa October 2013)  So I played the expansion for a couple months, until I got bored and returned to the original game come 2014. I was sure that the glitch the gold-helmet vanguard used had been since patched, so I dove right in... \n\n...only to see the reverse overheads, extreme dragging/acceleration, and spinning again, with it becoming more frequently used through the year. \n\nKeep in mind that despite me starting to play the game more than five years ago and having ~1,200 hours, I'm nowhere near a master at the game. A slightly below average novice at best. The way I learned how to play has rendered me too rigid to change. Newer players coming in either take up the new drag/spin tactics, or give up much sooner than they would have a year prior. You may just say that I'd need to \"get gud\" and such, and indeed I tried, time and time again. While I could use *some* forms of dragging/acceleration, everything else was and still is alien to me. \n\nBut alas, I kept playing, increasingly less frequent due to finding more new games to occupy my attention. I'd find myself revisiting Chivalry time and time again. But every time, there was less drive for me. I could feel myself become more jaded with every gap between when I played. I began seeing many more level 50+ players. Then the first level 60's started popping up.  The exploits become the way of the game, anyone trying to learn the old ways and play the game as they learned in the tutorial would be obliterated, and my skill continued to be stagnant.\n\nWeeks of not playing the game turned into months, only playing for about a week before uninstalling the game again. Come late 2016, I had had enough. The long bouts of radio silence from the developers regarding Chivalry ever since Mirage was announced made me lose faith in them doing anything to fix things on their own. The skill gap growing as large as the Grand Canyon made me lose faith in anyone new coming to the game staying any longer than it takes to level out of the low rank servers. The toxicity of the countless level 50+ & 60+ (and sometimes even higher) players shunning those who were a lot more vocal in their complaints than me, and were totally complicit with the current state of the broken combat made me lose faith in the community. By the end of the year, I would begin my longest gap in playing, around seven or eight months.\n\nOver the course of 2017 and 2018, I'd occasionally reinstall Chivalry to give it another try...\nBut it was all the same. Same jaded experience, same good as mute developers, same unforgiving community. I no longer had the same strength to witstand it all. Singular weeks of having the game installed and playing it turned to days. Days turned to hours. Hours turned to minutes.\n\nAnd as I write this, I just finished my most recent bout of my lingering addiction for Medieval Carnage. My lowest amount of playtime yet. Barely even an hour. Now, I have truly given up.\n\nAs I wait for Mordhau, which I have followed the developent of since it was simply called \"Slasher\" and considered a tech demo, I can't help but look back at Chivalry with a mixture of emotions. Maybe it's why I've been coming back for more for all these years. Yearning for a new first-person-slasher, and returning to this game since it is the only one that can scratch my itch for melee combat.  I feel excited for Mordhau, being hit with waves of nostalgia from 2012 and 2013 during the golden age of Chivalry.  I hate to see the game in the state that it's in, and having a spiritual successor inevitably seal its fate. But at the same time, I'm happy to see a new game in the niche first-person-slasher genre arise with features Chivalry players only could have dreampt of.  I'm angry at the developers leaving their game in the shape it is in now, but at the same time I'm glad that they made it in the first place. I hope history does not repeat itself with Mordhau; Well... it's negative points in history, anyways.\n\nAnd now...with concurrent players barely reaching 500 on a good day, no sign of any developer feedback, and exploting charlatans having surpassed rank 80 in some cases...\n\nI believe it is time for the old, tired, and battered warrior known as Chivalry to die a quiet, peaceful death. It may be the way of the warrior to die in battle, amidst conflict and suffering; But this game's history has shown it has seen well enough of it already. A soft end is well deserved.\n\nAfter more than half a decade of fun, fighting, and folley... \n\nI bid thee farewell, old friend Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.\n Rest well.

I did play the game over 50 hours after all.  In the end I was not half bad at the game.  Kills against your average player were fairly consistent.  I just didn\u2019t think having learned how to exploit a game with several broken game mechanics made me good at anything.  I didnt think that using a flawed system to gain an advantage gave me any sort of satisfaction knowing that it wasn\u2019t my skill which predicated my success- because make no mistake, there is no skill in this game.   It\u2019s simply a bunch of immature trolls and children who exploit a busted game so they can get some sort of ego boost from talking shit in chat, or on peoples reviews.

While in many games the matchmaking tries to balance ranks and pair players with others at their level.. This game helps you out when you're new by giving low rank servers to choose from.. The problem is many of the players on these servers are highly experienced, playing on alternate accounts for the sake of slaughtering newbies. Then, once you're level 15 (Still very inexperienced) you're not even allowed to play on these servers anymore, forcing you to play with people who typically have hundreds of hours on gametime on you..

It was one of the reasons I got Steam in the first place.\n\nIn the beggining, it was awesome. There were a few bugs and crashes and what-not but nothing overwhelming that caused me not want to play it. Every now and again there would be an update that would add this map or fix this bug, etc. \n\nAs you can tell, I have [b]alot[/b] of time put into this game. I know every map, every bug, every exploit, everything about this game.\n\n[i][b]So why am I not reccommending this game, despite all the fun I had with it?[/b][/i]\n[list]\n    [*]The same pesky little bugs are still not fixed. Some of these have been with the game since launch.\n    [*]Developers apparently do not care about these bugs. \n    [*]Every week or two there's a new \"update\" which in reality is another wave of skins and paid cosmetic items. In these \"updates\" there are no bug fixes or gameplay improvements. AT ALL. (OK, maybe there are some, BUT!) Whenever there IS a bugfix it's something they fucked up with the previous update, or they just fix 100 things you would never think about, thus things that don't really affect your experience. Always ignoring the big old bugs.\n    [*]Optimization is still a load of bull. Especially new maps.\n    [*]This game can't handle alot of players at the same time, so if you go into those massive 40+ player servers with epic battles, you will see how everyone has at least 150-200 ping, even though the ping-o-meter says they're fine.\n    [*]Nowadays most players have very high rank, so new people have absolutely no way to evolve and be able to enjoy the game unless they become highly dedicated to this game.\n    [*]All high rank players know the animation exploits a.k.a. \"Dragging\", which makes it almost impossible and incredibly difficult for a newbie to stand any chance. (Many believe that dragging is intentionally put in by the developers, and it might just be so, but the mechanic still unbalances the game for new people. Drag in competitive all you want, but it destroys the game when constantly used in regular play.)\n    [*]Game often crashes.\n    [*]Due to the high amount of ranked players, Free for Alls have become a joke, where high-ranks simply ignore eachother and pursue anyone who's not as good as them. Literally teaming against the noobs, because dragging amongst themselves is simply too much work. And when there are no noobs in the match, everyone just looks at eachother doing nothing and spamming \"COME HITHER\" or just chatting with the in-game voices, and if anyone dares to try to kill someone, that someone is utterly raped to death until they leave the game.\n    [*]They removed the first-person death mechanic. Before when someone chopped your head off you would still view the world from your head, now it just goes to third person. Which is utterly boring.\n    [*]Deadliest Warrior. Yes that DLC is a con itself. Why? Because that game has better training than Medieval Warfare ever did. Goes to show you how, if presented with money and a brand, these devs will go out to make things actually good, but ignore their own game's flaws in the process.\n    [*]The game's community is very toxic, speak the wrong thing or attack the server's favourite and get kicked, admins have no problem in kicking you if your lag spikes for one second or if you best them in combat. And complaining about exploits or bugs is seen as weak and noobish.\n    [*]There have been several cases of censorship in the forums. People end up getting banned from posting because they criticized the game. Shows you what kind of people you're dealing with.\n    [*]If you're trying to adress a problem with the game, this community will ridicule you and belittle you in any way they can.\n  \n[i][b]But you must be thinking, it can't be ALL bad, right?[/b][/i]\n\nCorrect, the game isn't just bad game development and milking players for cosmetic items the devs would never have the talent to make. (At least the artists who created them get a small share of it all) There are good things in it aswell.\n\n[list]\n    [*]If you're [b]extremely[/b] lucky you will actually find a balanced match that is fun to play and has good teamwork.\n    [*]The in-game voice mechanics are still fun to use.\n    [*]Rarely you will find a player that doesn't know how to drag, and that way you can have a nice, competitive duel that flows well since no exploits are being used.\n    [*]Playing with friends is fun. - Let me emphasize that a bit more. If you are planning on getting this game to play with friends, then you should get it. If you're going solo, think twice.\n    [*]You CAN meet nice people, not 100% of the community are hateful mongrels, and I have met good people through this game which I still talk to to this day. But don't expect a great much from the community in general.\nSadly, when you scale the good and the bad, the bad wins.

Archery (though hated by other players) feels like you're truly hurling arrows at 150 feet per second, and it's oh-so-satisfying when you nail a headshot.\nWhenever you died, it was usually your fault for doing something like charging into a large group of enemies by yourself like an idiot, or making a wrong move in a duel like attacking too late or blocking too early thus leaving yourself vulnerable-- all things that made sense and things that you could fix with enough practice. Over time, you'd eventually get more comfortable with the mechanics become better at the game and really get a feel for the rhythm of how to properly fight. There was nothing more gratifying than having a fair fight in these early stages of the game and winning with your own cunning and skill.\n\nThis, however completely changes once you hit level 16.\n\nAt level 16 you're kicked out of the level 1-15 servers and are tossed into the world of what people like to call the \"ballerinas.\" You see, Chivalry has these glitches with the hitbox detection and movement speed that were NEVER fixed. I myself noticed both kinds of glitches rarely on my 1 through 15 journey and it let me score some lucky kills, but what the rest of the (incredibly toxic!) community did was figure out how to replicate these glitches so much so that it became the meta to use them in combat.\nLet me explain: when you swing a weapon in Chivalry, your mouse control slows down to a fixed turn rate during the swing so that you can't helicopter your sword around like some kind of medieval fidget spinner. It kept the game grounded and realistic with trying to simulate how it really feels to swing around something that's really heavy. What the glitch would do was it would remove that turn rate limit and turn you and your weapon into a swinging and spinning mess of damage. This glitch, combined with maxed out mouse sensitivity would make it basically impossibly to block this. Combat went from a game of skill and tactics to overcome the enemy to this mess of combatants seeing who can spin the fastest, blocking attacks and dealing damage at impossible angles because of the broken hitbox detection.\n\nAs a fresh 16, this ballerina-fest was very disheartening, but I eventually decided to learn how to use these glitches to my own advantage so that I could stand a chance against the ballerinas, but that's basically what ruined the game for me.\nAll the grittiness and the realism found in the first 15 levels of the Chivalry was replaced by the ridiculous ballerina meta, making your heavy warhammer that would take a man his life to train to be able to just hold it (let alone use it in combat), as light as a feather and able to be spun around at mach speed.\n\nThis is not the same game that the YouTube legends such as TotalBiscuit (Rest in Peace), Criken, and Yogscast made videos about all those years ago.

I warn you that this is going to be a long read.\n\nChivalry as a standalone product was released in September 2012, five years after its' initial debut. It had been known beforehand as \"Age of Chivalry\" - one of many Half Life 2 mods. Being officially accepted into the Steam market must have been an incredible experience for the developers, which really shows in the early builds of the game. The tutorial is one of the only things that remain untouched since the release, and I could really feel the enthusiasm. It's easily one of the best tutorials I've ever seen. The voice acting is phenomenal and the early maps look & play perfectly. The level of immersion was unreal, and I've yet to see anyone come close. I'd go as far as saying that the first few weeks one of the best experiences in my entire gaming career. Everyone was amazed at the fact that the combat system played so well, and that it actually worked in an [b]online environment with up to 32 players.[/b] The developers' enthusiasm carried on to make a few important patches, as well as new weapons. Unfortunately, however, all good things must come to an end.\n\nAt some point, Torn Banner decided to completely redo the hitbox system, into what is now known as the \"bubble\". They decided to fix something that wasn't broken - the hit detection. A crucial selling point of the game. Everyone opposed the change, everyone still hates it to this day, but the new system remains. You wouldn't think that changing cubic to spherical would make that much of a difference, but it did. Things were so bad that the developers decided to implement [b]FAKE DISTANCE[/b] between the players, in a game that's very much about spacing. I can't help but compare this move governments subsidizing things that don't work. Fake distance, multiplied by your ping, means that if an enemy is moving away from you, you cannot hit them with fists or daggers, and short weapons are worse in general. Longer weapons are completely unaffected. \n\nThe next decision was to make the claymore (the sword in the game's logo) stronger. Everyone preferred the slower, more damaging weapons to the faster but weaker claymore. Despite being one of the longest weapons in the game, they also made it one of the fastest, while still being able to kill anyone in 4 hits. This instantly promoted it from slightly below average to a game-breaking absurdity, and votekicked on sight. I'm sure Torn Banner will patch this.\n\nNext up: customization. A very neat idea and executed quite well. One tiny little problem - both red and blue teams can wear a black uniform, they look almost identical. Are they going to patch it?\n\nSomewhere around this time, Vanguards (the class with the longest weapons) became glitched, because their charge attack catapulted them forwards at least three times the distance, as if they had a jetpack. These rocket Vanguards were funny at first, though they did lose their charm after a month or two. When they finally fixed the issue, it turned out that the patch broke the audio, the graphics and toggle sprint. This took another few weeks to revert back to normal.\n\nIntroduction of microtransaction hats. Great! More revenue means more patches, right?\n\nIntroduction of microtransaction weapon reskins. Guys, can you fix the claymore?\n\nIntroduction of microtransatction character reskins. Guys? \n\nIntroduction of even more hats... I think I've seen this happen before.\n\n\nIn the meantime, people had discovered a bunch of exploits. Instantly striking with gigantic, slow weapons, feinting without any stamina cost, shrinking their hitbox to the size of a football or just about anything you can think of that defies both physics and proper game design. Most of the community have enough decency not to use the claymore (they don't want to be votekicked), but by now they've figured out what works best. As a result, you see very few of the 40+ weapons ingame.\nThis was the rise of incredibly arrogant \"pro\" players, who are on a mission to have the highest K/D ratio possible, and throwing tantrums if they take any team damage. It is enough to google \"what's the best sword\" or \"how to glitch through blocks\", and turn Chivalry into a game of lucky hit, because no honest man can defend against that in an online environment. These players can be overwhelmed due to their lack of fundamentals, but it just isn't worth it. At this point, the fun has been completely sucked out of the game.\n\nYou may have also heard about a game called Chivalry: Deadliest Warrior. A flawless concept, and the beta was tons of fun... only it remained a beta forever. It was released as DLC for 20$ and abandoned by the devs, because they couldn't get the netcode to work.\n\n\nI find myself wondering what happened to this once fantastic, once indie game studio, and how they drove a perfectly good game into the ground, as well as failing to deliver such a promising sequel. \nHopefully, Torn Banner will attempt to improve the situation, but we all know that's not going to happen. Maybe a competent modder will do all the heavy lifting for them (for free). \n\nYou may see me ingame every now and then, but it's more for sentimental value than anything else.

But not anymore. \n\nAs time has passed more people got good at the game resulting in a lot of higher ranked players.\nNow you might think that that's a good thing. Well no, in this community it isn't.\n\nInstead of good players playing against each other you have 90% of highranks (45+) playing in team objective servers and rank stacking on the same team (usually attack side). So basically instead of having balanced fun matches most high ranked players purposefully join the team with more highranks which ends up in very unbalanced teams and an almost guaranteed win for the stacked team. \nYou really only need to look at the rank distribution at the start of a match and you can predict which team wins with 99% certainty.\n\nNot only is it unfair for the players on the other team but it makes matches just overall very boring. As someone who reached rank 50 I either join the stack and will not be challenged at all (imagine a pro soccer player playing against a 5 year old) or I join the other team and stand no chance at all.\n\nIt has been like this for quite a while but it's reached it's peak lately where you really have to search hard for a server where this doesn't happen every match.

Learning from your mistakes is essential in this type of game and what you consider a ''mistake'' with one enemy might be the the exact weakness of another. You have to adapt. Do not play your opponent's game, make him play yours. Force him to get out of his comfort zone by making him face something he's never faced before. F*** up his timings and combos, be unpredictable. \n\nAlso, it takes time to get REALLY used to any weapon at all as they all require different footwork and range so the learning curve is pretty steep. But it's well worth it. I play this game since it came out. I've seen ballerinas arise from the dark and become a plague for this otherwise well balanced game. But I saw it as another opportunity to adapt and get better. There is nothing in this game that is unbeatable. No strategy and no one. Give it time, learn from your mistakes and adapt to your  opponent. \n\nThis game still makes me rage a lot, but the moments of glory when I kill a dozen enemies in a single life and I start to see people think twice before engaging a fight with me, or even run away from me, make up big time for it.  \n\nI've seen a lot of posts taking about how bad the Chiv community is. I totally disagree. Sure, there are some cocky heads who will treat you like shit when you fuck up, but you find that in every game. I even consider the chivalry community as a ''brotherhood'' where people play and laugh together. I see people t-bagging me as a sign of respect after a good fight, cuz I just know it's what they think. If an a**hole starts to teamkill every ally on sight, a vote will inevitably arise within seconds to kick this person out. \n\nTo conclude, do not let others bring your morale and motivation down through insults or t-bagging; we ALL sucked and were  harraced in such ways at some point. Fight your way through this and you will be reworded with fun, glory, new friends and a really awesome and unique game.

As a kickstarter backer, I liked almost everything about it. The melee combat felt good, the sound design and graphics were great considering the game's age. It was my go-to game for stress relief and most people would agree that there is something relaxing about chopping some heads or limbs off from time to time. The only thing that I disliked was its toxic community, yes Chivalry: Medieval Warfare has one of the worst communities you can find in a video game.\n\nI've had read some reviews in the past about people abandoning the game after level 15 and my assumption was that skilled players overwhelm the high rank servers. My assumptions proved to be correct, but the thing is I do enjoy games where more skilled players have a clear advantage over the so called \"noobs\" and if the game is enjoyable enough, it only motivates me to get better. The main problem with Chivalry is not the fact that low rank players are \"owned\" by players with hundreds of hours of gameplay time. The problem is what you need to learn in order to play better....\n\nAs soon as I landed on the high rank servers (the game doesn't let you join low rank ones when you reach level 16), I started seeing other players doing moves that I had never seen before, basically butchering some other players. My initial thought was to learn how to do those same combat moves. I checked some youtube videos and that's when the game was instantly killed for me. Over the time, players found hit box and movement glitches which -if you use them well- either cannot be blocked or give you a clear advantage. It still does require skill to exploit those glitches, but unfortunately the very existence thereof killed all the immersion and enjoyment I get from Chivalry. If you want to know what I'm talking about, just search keywords such as \"reverse overhead\", \"rainbow\", \"dragging\". It is a shame really, designing a game with obvious glitches and not fixing them, because there is a player base enjoying their time from the exploitation of such glitches. It is a shame, because Chivalry would otherwise be a great game, for what it is.\n\n[b]6/10[/b]\n", "timestamp_created": 1540411659, "timestamp_updated": 1540411659, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 70, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.780303537845611572", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "42022886": {"recommendationid": "42022886", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074448911", "num_games_owned": 70, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10258, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 9, "last_played": 1551813921}, "language": "english", "review": "If you intend to play this game with anyone other than your buds you might as well just not buy this game.\n\nWhy? Because multiplayer is absolute CANCER no matter how you slice it.\n\nYes, there are servers for low levels, but there are so many people smurfing that it doesnt matter. There will always be 3-4 people at the top of the server leaderboards that have 3-10x the kills of anybody else. Some people are genuinely really good, but most people that still play have 1000 hours or more in the game and despite having massive egos and experience they win by pulling stupid dogshit cheese that takes no skill at their level and is out of a newbie's understanding. This is why nobody new is playing.\n\nWhat am I talking about exactly? Let's say you like to fight light on your feet, and you like the speed advantage that the Man At Arms offers. You're dueling a knight as a new player, and you manage to get in four or five hits with a norse sword without getting hit. Which is quite a feat considering that the knight has his sensitivity maxed and his sword is always slicing through the air just barely outside your body. You only need a couple more swings or thrusts to finish the kill. This is your 15th time dueling this knight and you've come unusually far, gotten to know how he fights, maybe gotten a little lucky this round. You go all out, doing your best to duck and parry around the knight's stupid half-attempted swings. Two more spins are coming and you backpedal the first, parry the second perfectly but the knight drags the sword backwards throughout the entire parry and swings forward at the very last second killing you instantly for the 15th time.\n\nI hate to break it to you guys but you can't actually swing a sword like that in real life. This mechanic is fucking broken horseshit because as long as the melee weapon is slow enough that it can be dragged it renders parrying- an essential mechanic- completely useless.\n\nDespite the loss you duel again, get him down to low hp, feint, make sure you swing first as you go in and you still eat a backswing or reverse overhead to the face out of nowheresville, going from 100 to 0 hp instantly. You realize the knight literally can kill you at any time and is simply horsing around as he decapitates your dead body for the 16th time in a row and laughs, \"HAH, im almost trying!\" How does this make you feel as a new player? No matter what you do, your quick little sword or dagger is somehow still slower to attack than the massive messer. Even if you know about drags and accels yours are still used in a subpar fashion. The fact that accelerating speed increases damage is realistic I guess but all it means is yet another disadvantage for new players. No matter what swings they manage to land they are doing less damage, period. People that have played this game since it came out know how to get hitboxes inside you while doing maximum damage, rendering anything you do utterly pointless. Why even fight someone if I'm gonna get quadruple feinted and decapitated by one swing that my opponent didn't even have to think to perform?\n\nThe answer: you dont. Because there's no reason to even try. Not to mention trying to fight archers when all you want to do is swordfight. Smh.\n\nOverall this game is neither fun nor rewarding because of toxic multiplayer gameplay.\n \nI'd give it at best a 4.5 out of 10 for that reason but playing with friends the game is much better, like 8/10", "timestamp_created": 1526234956, "timestamp_updated": 1526782198, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 295, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.809946656227111816", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "10414342": {"recommendationid": "10414342", "author": {"steamid": "76561198052799726", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 20179, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1518965471}, "language": "english", "review": "This is not a game.

It has its upsides, but the downsides are many, and considerable.\n\nFirst, the positive.  The Team Objective maps (the original ones at least, especially Stones Hill and Dark Forest) are nice.  The fact that it's not about your K/D score makes these maps fun.  In fact, the original TO maps are the only reason I played for so long, there were just that good.  The character customization is good and there's a fair bit of variety to be had (for a price...).  Finally, the ability to hack limbs and heads off of people and to slaughter peasants is always rather cathartic.\n\nUnfortunately, none of that can hide the fact that this game has some serious, serious flaws.  The maps have places were people can get stuck, sometimes permanently and only the F10 \"Suicide\" key can get you out.  You always dont just bounce off of objects either, you are completely stopped.  This is fine for things like walls and trees and the like, but things like small boulders that you'd think you'd just run over do this as well.  It is very annoying to be charging at an enemy and all of a sudden get stopped by a knee-high log or something.\n\nThe mechanics are what absolutely destroys this game.   You raise your weapon or shield to properly block (looking at the point of the weapon, just like they say in the tutorial) and, somehow, you get hit anyways.  Nothing is more frustrating than to raise your tower shield and somehow get hit.  Mostly this is because the hit boxes are not very accurate, with some being disproportionately large and others smaller.  Many times I've seen or had weapons go through a person's model and no damage be recorded.  Worse are those that exploit the swing mechanics, that spin and bend and look for all the world they are going through a seizure.\n\nScenario balancing is also something that is very wonky.  Some, like Battlefield or Stones Hill, are very well balanced or at most slightly weighted to attacker or defender and doesn't impact the experience.  Others though, like Coldfront, are so dramatically skewed that it's almost unwinnable on one side.  On Coldfront, for instance, I have only seen the defenders win a total of three times in all the hours I've played.\n\nSupport is almost totally non-existant.  For every patch that Torn Banner puts out, virtually none of them have addressed the major flaws.  They have also stopped development on the game and focused on purely tweaking minor details.  I liken it to putting a band aid on a cut finger while ignoring the sucking chest wound.  \n\nPricing is another matter.  This game is just not worth the $25 they ask for.  Now that being said, Chiv features prominently on Midweek Madness sales and the big Mid-Summer and -Winter sales for as low as $5, which is a perfect price for this game (and at which price I bought it during 2014's Mid-Summer sale). That being said, if you want to have access to some of the helmet variants as well as new weapon models, you have to pay for all of that.  Sometimes those models are as expensive or even more than the game itself when it's on sale.\n\nFinally, the community is one of the worst I have ever encountered.  Trolls, hackers, and scrubs inhabit every single server of Chiv, and it's nearly enough to make you try and track down the offenders in order to give them the throat punch they so justly deserve.  It's enough that it makes the worst offenders on Team Fortress 2 look like little angels.  Yes, that's how bad it is.\n\nAt one time I did enjoy this game.

The feel of melee combat is awesome, with great sounds and fantastic animations. It looks great and plays great.\n\nThe reason I don't recommend this is that when you get to a high enough skill level, the gameplay drops to a level of absurdity that involves confusing the game engine by contorting your character's body in all sorts of ways that are impossible in real life, to cause the side of your weapon's hitbox to collide with back of the enemy's exposed hitbox. I.e. turning your character 180 degrees while cutting straight down (or stabbing forward) with a very long two handed weapon, trying to make the flat of the blade (not the edge or tip) touch your opponent's back at the last second of the swing. Your character being off-balance and stumbling forward gives you a great range advantage when you can spin on your heels with the mouse to guide the already finished strike (but still active hitbox) into your enemy. This is just one of the styles to guide a vertical strike of any kind for a hit, and there are many other awkward and unnatural ways to make contact and kite with different weapons at top level play.\n\nI'd recommend this game for casuals since its fun when its casual vs casual, but then those casuals end up having to face the pros on the same server and don't have a prayer because of the abnormal weapon styles.\n\nThe devs missed the mark with this one by a small margin, and hopefully a sequel to this game might be able to improve on some of the failures from the ground up with new code.", "timestamp_created": 1445476698, "timestamp_updated": 1445476698, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 136, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.784041225910186768", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29328661": {"recommendationid": "29328661", "author": {"steamid": "76561198073994447", "num_games_owned": 1470, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 9515, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1433287492}, "language": "english", "review": "Got the game pretty much right after the release and loved it so much.

It is very fun to play.\n\n\n\n\nFor about 9 hours(ish).\n\nChivalry unfortunately is a game that doesn't get better with age. Rather, it ages like milk. After 9 hours of brutal slaughter and decapitations you will begin to enter the game's seamy underbelly.\nThis is due to their two different server types: Beginner and Advanced.\nBeginner is where you will spend the first 9 or so hours in Chivalry, playing with those under level 15. Matches in these servers are incredibly fun to play, with everyone at an even level allows for fun, fair - albeit gratuitous- fights.\nThis part of the game I loved, playing nearly daily to get my fill of medieval mediation.\nBut then we level up, become a big boy, and the gates to beginner servers close.\nDue to this you have no choice but to play in the advanced servers, but this seems fair right? I mean, isn't it good that there is a separation in skill levels?\nTrue, but as you begin your first tentative steps into advanced matches, you'll notice that the game you loved so much is just a little bit different.

I would like to say, that I really loved this game, as I love the medieval period and history at the same time. Finally, I think it was the first straight melee oriented FPS with a deep depth of gameplay mechanics. Besides Chivalry 1, we were excited to dive into this medieval madness. It is worth mentioning that Chivalry was really great and had something attractive in it, despite even numerous bugs and poor optimization. So let us take a closer look at this product. \n[h1] What was actually good in Chivalry [/h1]\n[b] Design. [/b] That is something. Knights, man-at-arms archers looked really authentic, moreover, two factions had a totally different units design. It was quite easy to define friend or foe and these European helms made you think that you ended up right into battle. Finally, weapons looked really brutal and dangerous, which made you think how barbaric and violent old melee combat was, unlike these fantasy giant diamond swords. \n[b] Maps. [/b] How to organize the crowd of angry players? Give them objective and they will at least try to play as a team. This was something, it was not a usual deathmatch or free-for-all, the point is that the map was divided into stages and one team had to defend and other had to complete a specific objective in order to proceed. The goals were different like pushing a ram, burn granaries or kill the king. It added an organization to a game and a structure. I still think that this is one of the best game modes and should be in every game. \n[b] Combat. [/b] I would have said that it is hard to learn \u2013 hard to master. In Chivalry you were evolving over time. So you learned new tricks, tried to outsmart your enemies and even studied their technics. Yes, it included exploiting the game engine, but I really like it as a part of the mastering process. In the end, you were able to kill new players with bare hands. Player was able to feel like a real master swordsman. Of course, violence and blood are included. \n[b] Sound and voice acting. [/b] Screams, shouts, jokes, and medieval music. Imagine a picture, where 15 players are charging and screaming, this was a precious time. Finally a joke from the game: \u201cYour sword looks a little short, you know what I mean?\u201d\n[h1] What could possibly go wrong? [/h1]\n    I understand that games become old and will be abandoned in the end, but Chivalry could stay longer on the market. Sadly all pluses turned to be minutes in the game. \n    [b] Design. [/b] With the addition of paid skins and collaboration items, it appeared that it was really hard for new players to define enemies. As there were red, gold, brown, black, pink colors added to a game. Tons of cosmetics which brought Chivalry to a fantasy style, yeah, they have added crystal swords. Furthermore, you were not able to get these skins for free, no loot boxes only money. Finally, developers were focused on adding new swords skins rather than fixing the game. \n    [b] Maps. [/b] There were plenty of maps added, but they were poorly optimized and a bunch of them were made by a community. In addition, original maps were better at some point. If you ask me, I would tell you that I prefer old maps more. Anyway, they have added something. \n    [b] Combat. [/b] Some players became a real guru of Chivalry, so it was almost impossible to hit them. Moreover, two 50 rank players could completely destroy the server. We cannot blame them for that, as they have played for a long time. But we can see a chain here, there were no updates, so player base failed to refresh. As a result, only these players were left, I mean they really love the game. So the new player had no chance to stay against them, as he or she would die all the time. In few last years, I had troubles with playing, as servers were half-empty or had a high ping, all others had rank 40+, so every fight became a struggle and lasted for 3-5 minutes. Chivalry does not provide an opportunity for new players to learn. \n    [b] Updates. [/b] After the release developers did not make major updates or fundamental changes, which was a crucial factor for Chivalry. There were no new classes, no new weapons and no major changes to mechanics. Only skins and maps were added. Finally, Chivalry did not release any major events, such as Christmas or Halloween. We had only some pumpkin and Santa\u2019s hats. The lack of evolution was essential for this game. Thus, players did not stay in Chivalry for a long time. I guess at first Torn Banners were working on the DLC and then on Mirage. \n    \n[h1] DLC [/h1] \nNow, this was awful. At first, it looked really attractive, as I enjoyed the TV-series Deadliest Warrior. I did not hesitate and bought this Chivalry Deadliest Warrior. The initial issue is that DLC launches as a standalone game. It has separate servers, units, and game modes. So you cannot play with any DLC content in the base game. Deadliest Warrior did not have this Team Objective mode and had simple FFA fight of different classes. The sound was good, but it was the only game\u2019s plus. The lack of purpose, a small portion of content and balance issues made players regret buying Deadliest Warrior. As a result, base game was more favorable to play than this. Now Deadliest Warrior is dead. \n[h1] Conclusion [/h1] \nThe combination of no updates, hard entry point and lack of evolution, have led this game to a stagnation. Resulting in the impossibility for the player base to refresh. The game was good once, but now there is no point to buy it. Especially, if you are new to the genre. Yet I would like to rate it 9/10 (Fantastic game), as I love the thematic. Besides this high rate, I do not recommend this game, as at the current state it will not bring a satisfaction to a new player.\n", "timestamp_created": 1541537538, "timestamp_updated": 1541537538, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 42, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.744504988193511963", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "29412566": {"recommendationid": "29412566", "author": {"steamid": "76561198237738450", "num_games_owned": 55, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 2329, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1485407679}, "language": "english", "review": "once you reach beyond 15. this game goes to complete sh*t. lvl 50s and 60s. ruin this game with servers filled with people abusing the exploits with the combat.

This review will track my progress as I log more and more hours into the game as it stands (as per this edit) I'm at [b]23 hours[/b], that's just under one full day of gaming. At the end of this review, I'll try to break down pro's and con's of the game and look a little more in-depth at what the game has to offer.\n\n[b]Level 1[/b]\nStarting the game, you'll notice the lack of single-player options - and right you are. This game is based around purely multiplayer midieval combat. So lets start our first game. Picking a server is easy at a lower level, those highlighted in green are [i]low-rank[/i] servers, that means players level 0 to 15. These servers generally have a high population, and cycle through the game modes.\nWhen you (or I, in this case) pick a server, you'll be able to see the current gamemode as well as current/limit players. I started with a low-pop Team Deathmatch game with 16 total players. When I hopped into the game, it was about halfway through, and as the teams were even, I got to pick a side (Agatha Knights or Mason Order). Now, these teams don't really matter all that much later on, no one will shun you for picking one over the other, but in my case I chose the Mason Order (Favorite color is Red). From there, there are four different classes.\n[b]Classes[/b]\n[list]\n [*]Archer - Light, ranged troops. Beginner weapons are Longbow, Dagger, Crossbow, and Javelin (with optional sheild)\n [*]Man at Arms - Light, fast troops with low armor. Beginner weapons are Sword, Axe, Mace, and Quarter Staff.

(Can perform a charge attack)\n [*]Knight - Tank character with increadable armor, but slow moving. Beginner weapons are Bastard sword, Greataxe, Hammer, and Flail.\n[/list]\n\nSo I hopped in as an archer, and immediately regretted my decision. Team deathmatch is almost squadbased, with groups of 3 or 4 charging at once, and everyone seems to have a general hatred towards archers. So, I died. A lot. Eventually I switched to a Man at Arms with the beginner shortsword. The speed was amazing, and I managed my first kill before dying. The game appeared ruthless to me, with wave after wave of enemies ready to stab me in the back - or throw something into my lower-dick area. But it was fun, decapitating the few I could. By the end game, I had 5 kills and 13 deaths - but the five I killed were well worth it.\n\n[b]Levels 1-15[/b]\n\nGame after game, I was killed. Repetitavely. But, I got better. Learned how to be more aware of my situation. Learned the different swings, and when to block/kick. By the time I was level ten, I could hold my own - and had even won a few 1v4 fights. My friends then got the game on sale - and let me tell you, when your friends are playing, the fun increases exponentially. Between level ten and fifteen I had my best games, including my very best being 43 kills and 3 deaths (Holy Shit). And the best part, I was progressing. I unlocked equipment, weapons. I learned when to use specific classes. I memorized the maps and knew my strategy. I went from absolutely terrible to a force to be reckoned with.\n\n[b]Levels 15 and on[/b]\nI just reached level 16. But it's far from over. I have many more weapons I want to unlock, and many more kills I wish to obtain. I do like this game, a lot. Even the deadliest warrior portion - though it is significantly more buggy.\n\n[h1]Pros and Cons[/h1]\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n [*] Price - At $21.99 CAD, the price is a little steep. I'm glad my buddies got it on sale for $8.00\n [*] Hit boxes - They are getting better, but they're not great. Sometimes you get clipped for seemingly no reason at all.\n [*] Game stuttering - even surpassing the recommended requirements by a mile, I still get stuttering.\n[/list]\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n [*] Hours of Fun - The game is awesome.

Time to review this shitshow of a game myself. So, let me just say, I have about 510 hours sunken into the game, recently got level 40 and let me just say... This, is not a good game. It is addictive, not good. Now, there are, of course, countless reviews telling you WHY this is not a good game, but it does have it's upsides, which is why I am still playing, after 500 hours. It is almost impossible to put into words, but let me try.\n\nSo, first off, we have the most important point. Torn Banner has totally abandoned this game. Mirage: Arcane Warfare, their other IP, is dead as dirt. It had 3 players worldwide when I checked. But for some reason, Torn Banner have abandoned Chivalry, their only successful title.\n\nSecondly, we have weapon balance. Slow, and fast weapons, more damage for the former, less damage for the latter, along with a few minor features. Sounds fair, right? Factor in the fact that, due to a dragging system that does not understand momentum, an EXTREMELY essential part of melee combat, that these slow weapons can be swung faster than the lightest weapons in the game. Still sound fair to you? The meta is the Messer, or Zweihander, both being 3 hit kills on the Knight, the heaviest unit in the game. While there are a couple well balanced weapons in the game, there are not many.\n\nThird, the spine breaking ducks and drags you can make. Basically, due to the hitboxes of the playermodels, dragging, parrying, everything, a Knight or Vanguard with any weapon can crouch, look up, and not only block 360 degrees around him, but also attack. It is an ungodly shitshow of absolute slaughter that defies the very laws of the game, and good luck trying to tell anyone doing it that it is an unpatched exploit to the game's engine, because...\n\nFour. The community is toxic. Anyone above level 40 has their head so far up their own arse, they can no longer take oxygen into their lungs. (Ripped that joke off from JonTron.) So, expect a Knight who killed you while you were behind him to spam the laugh voiceline in game, and spam \"ez\" or \"lol\" in chat. Also, teabagging, because who does not like that? Yeah.\n\nI probably missed a few points/contradicted myself/left stuff out, but to summarise... Chivalry: Medieval Warfare is not a good game. It is an infuriating, poorly designed, horribly balanced mess... But God damn, it is the ONLY thing of it's type that exists, to my knowledge, and after playing it, every other system of melee combat in a game will just seem lackluster. However, at this point in time, I advise you look up a game called Mordhau. Mordhau is poised to bring some life back to the community, and purge a few of the glaring issues with the game. But, honestly, I have to say yes, I would recommend this game, but not to anyone who gets annoyed easily, because this game and the people who play it will drive you insane and haunt your fucking dreams.", "timestamp_created": 1526930329, "timestamp_updated": 1526930329, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 35, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.765688657760620117", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18556609": {"recommendationid": "18556609", "author": {"steamid": "76561198112268150", "num_games_owned": 141, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 2785, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1447404692}, "language": "english", "review": "Almost 50 hours isn't much, but enough to make a proper judgement. So, let's go.\n\nI love the game. It really is fantastic. I love the weapons, the classes, the objectives, the tension, the duels, etc. Ok, if I love all these aspects, why do I not recommend this game? Let me tell you why.\n\nReason 1 :\n\nNo such thing as fair-play in this game. Yes, I get it. It's a teams game. But there's a significant difference between team playing and ganging up on someone. (Really, 5 VS 1 isn't fun at all. And it happens constantly).\n\nReason 2 :\n\nAnimation exploits. I've read about it in other negative reviews and thought to myself \"Hey, it can't be that bad.\"  Well, sadly. It is that bad. High-ranked and experienced players have mastered this exploit, which makes it impossible for a new player to even stand a chance against them in a fight. This leads new players to quickly abandon the game an uninstall it. Which in the end, destroys the game as a whole, since no new players arrive. I myself, have encountered such exploiters and couldn't even land a hit on them, which resulted in me dying in a single hit. Apparently this has been an issue for a long while, and yet the developers have done nothing about it. How to recognize an exploiter? If you see a character flying and spinning around like a balerrina with a giant sword or a giant hammer and then you die for no apparent reason, then you know you've encountered an exploiter.\n\nReason 3 :\n\nThe game's community. Oh dear lord. I've played many multiplayer games and never before have I encountered such a toxic community. You literally can't say a word during a match. Say the wrong thing or attack the server's favorite player and you get kicked. Defeat the best player in a fight, and immediately a vote for kicking you appears on your screen. Furthermore, try pointing out or adressing a problem with the game's mechanics, you will be either ignored or laughed at. Complaining about / pointing out obvious exploits of the game's flawed animations will result in calling you a noob, a whiny pussy or a crying little fag.\n\nThat's it. That's the three major issues with the game. Don't get me wrong. Sometims you get lucky and find a decent match and then you can have plenty of fun. But most of the time, like really, most of the time, you encounter people which I have described above.", "timestamp_created": 1445199562, "timestamp_updated": 1456574644, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 302, "votes_funny": 26, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798223912715911865", "comment_count": 40, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "16057077": {"recommendationid": "16057077", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027213284", "num_games_owned": 251, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 8900, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1417814908}, "language": "english", "review": "Haven't played this game in half a year, but I have to speak up lest some poor sap get suckered in during the sale.\n\nChivalry was incredibly fun two years ago before all the exploits in the system were discovered, but they quickly became the metagame once they were mastered. Instantaneous overheads, feinting at no stamina cost, the ridiculous range of mouse dragging, all of this contributed to the game in its current (read: current as of half a year ago when I last gave it a chance) state.

This game used to be rather good. It is now a mess, after a series of patches came which broke the game a little more with each one.\n\nHere's a list of the game's issues:\n\n-Above all else, lack of interest/communication from the devs. All the other problems stem from this, as the devs are in charge of  upkeep. Chivalry's devs have been largely silent, and obvious flaws with the game are not fixed for months, if ever.\n\n-Poor server quality. While good 3rd-party servers can be found, the official Chivalry servers are trash. (Multiplay Game Servers, I'm looking at you!) Inexplicable ping spikes, servers booting 3/4 of the players randomly, stutters, freezes, crashes, desyncs, you name it.\n\n-Large amount of bugs. A lot of these are blatant and have been in existence for many months. They are too many to list, suffice to say they have been reported enough on the forums/ steam.\n\n-Ridiculous exploits of game mechanics. Behind-the-back instant hits with the heaviest weapon in the game (the maul), which can one-hit kill any class. Basically, you can make any weapon as fast as a dagger if you know how. Balanced? No sir, not even a little.\n\n-Poor map quality. A lot of the maps, especially the newer , user-made maps, are not up to par in terms of quality. Many are imbalanced to heavily favor attacker or defender. Many have bugs that effectively break the map. For example, gate doors remaining up after being battered all the way down, preventing players from accessing the next area, despite the attackers having 'won'.\n\n-Team stacking. Often one team will often have many more skilled players. The autobalance is a joke, because it throws just any player onto the other team to balance the numbers. It should pick an appropriately ranked player to level the teams, but it doesn't. Also: PLAYER TEAM DISTRIBUTION SHOULD BE RANDOMIZED, TO AVOID STACKING. All the good players often flock to one team, leaving the other team without a hope.\n\n-Flaws in the game engine/design. Here are a few: Attacks phasing through enemies and doing no damage. Blocks not working when they clearly should. Attacks being blocked when they shouldn't be. Shields turning illusory and letting attacks through. Mouse inputs ignored sometimes (you click and nothing happens). Spawn points up high enough that the whole team takes damage jumping down. Ambiguous custom armor colors in team-based games. \n\n-No autokicker. Not for high ping, or teamkilling, or hacking even. What online game has ever had an autokicker, right?\n\n-Few, if any admins. I've never seen one on an official server.\n\n\nSo there you have it. I'm sure there's more stuff I didn't mention. A fun game with a good concept ruined by out-of-touch devs, numerous bugs and various other issues.

I have 500+ hours on this, and all I can think of is remembering the good times. I hate this game so much because I used to love it to the point it became my most played game for almost one year. I'm gonna tell you why you should avoid this game that has become deteriorated over time (and has become less valuable than it was at release):\n\nThe good times, that was when this game didn't have regular crashes (it had none in fact). Now it crashes EVERY FIRST TIME you join the game, you Alt+F4 and then you have to again load the game. THEN it's very likely the server you wanted to join is full. You have to wait. Then it's possible that it crashes at the character screen etc... It's also possible to simply crash mid-game. I once had over 16 crashes while waiting for the server list to load. This never happened at the start.\n\nSecondly, the networking is riddled with problems. It's laggy, choppy and after a certain amount of players it's going to skip registrations of animations, hits and more. Even on 32 player server this happens from time to time. I can live with it occasionally but now it happens so frequently, most servers crash like every 30mins.\n\nThirdly, bugs, bugs and bugs. In the level design, in the combat, in the animations and the graphics. It's unbelievable how many collision problems there are in the game. The parrying is completely inconsistent, you can even block attacks coming from the back where there is no shielding whatsoever. Catapults disappear, send you to other realms, dragging is imprecise and in general the abuse of the animation movement that can happen at any time is just ridiculous.\n\nI don't want to spend much effort into the XP as it's just a gimmick, but it's funny to see how they fixed THAT particular thing that offers nothing new in the gameplay experience at all.\n\nI haven't talked about the spawnbug, but it happens... ALL the time. Players don't spawn anymore from one team and the Pings start to skyrocket. The only way is for an admin to force win or mapvote. This has been happening so many times and it's still, not, fixed, after ALL the updates in the mean time.\n\nOne of the most terrible things in Chiv is the chase system where you gain over 4 times as much speed as your opponent you're chasing to prevent endless cat and mouse. However, it's SO fast it's literally baffling. I have literally seen admins KICK players because they thought they were speedhacking, while they were simply being speed up by the game... Unbelievable. You sometimes see an enemy well out of range that faces you from the FRONT, and OFTEN (not sometimes, not occasionally, but very OFTEN) the game just dupes like always and SPEEDS HIM UP. IN FRONT OF YOU. WTF. This problem has been known forever, never fixed so far.\n\nLastly, the performance. The performance is (except for LODS) inexistant. The larger the new community maps become, the worse the performance. One big bubble of rendering all mashed together and hoping for the best.... It's what makes battle sometimes impossible. I'm running a rig that should run Chiv with ease. Crysis 1 runs almost twice as good as chiv. On top of that, the game has become a product for DLC. I appreciate the community made content and the extra stuff, and I WAS glad to support chivalry, but these updates from the last months are nothing but updates to milk out of the game. Literally, I saw update reasons listed that represented fixes for most of the maps, and NOTHING was changed. It was co\u00f6rdinated with the release of new DLC coupled with free weekend to make sure they could get as much as possible, without fixing any of the massively gamebreaking bugs.\n\nThe way I see it, the image of TornBanner I had when I watched their videos at the start of release and when I followed before release, it was amazing. I felt as if TornBanner was one of the rarer companies who really cared about the player base and what we wanted. I was so happy at one point that community made content would arise and would reward everyone, but I would never have though the game would still be slumbering in day-1 problems in addition to the extra problems added with each and every update. It's breaking, it's collapsing under the chaos in their code, and each new adaption just kills the game more. I thought I could go through it, but essentially, this is the line. THIS version of Chiv, I cannot recommend.\n\nRewind time 1 year and a half back, and we will meet again.

The first two flaws have basically been confirmed by the devs as game features so they probably won't be removed. You'll most likely enjoy the game if you can ignore these flaws. If you can't, it's going to suck.\n\nFlaw number 1: the combat gets really counter intuitive. At the lower levels, you see a lot of people fighting how you'd expect two medieval dudes to fight. Both face each other exchanging blows while attempting to parry and aiming for weak spots. Slightly up the ladder of skill, you see people doing what is called dragging. A swing will follow the camera of the swinger so people will drag their mouse into their attack to speed it up or away from their attack to slow it down. This often causes the opponant to parry at the wrong time so it's used quite a bit. The speed is capped so there aren't any beyblade fighters. Just thought I'd be clear about that. This is all pretty intuitive and makes sense for the most part. It's stops being intuitive once you run into the ballerinas. Ballerinas are players who abuse the shit out of dragging with slow weapons. They'll start the attack looking away from you and flail around in order to hit you. They often spin around in circles which gave them the name. This would be fine if the animation looked decent. it instead just looks like they are glitching out which leads a lot of players to believe they are hacking. You can counter it but it takes some time. It's annoying and it drives a ton of players out of the game. There is no use complaining about it on the steam forums. The mods there will just call you bad and say this garbage tactic is a legit strategy despite it looking like a laggy glitchfest. The only good news I can provide is that not everyone uses it so just throw all of your hatchets/knives at those who do.\n\nFlaw number 2: Archers are pretty OP. In a game of melee combat, you have high damage archers who can one hit kill you from the safety of their spawn. The archer class can also be deadly in duels if you actually manage to get close enough. They have a slight disadvantage as they are slow and don't have much/any armor but they can still fight just fine. Most archers that you will run into will be complete garbage. Most don't bother trying to melee fight and can't hit the broad side of a barn. Issue is, they are balanced for these people. They deal a ton of damage because they aren't balanced for people who can aim. Once you find someone who can aim and duel, the only solution is to hide behind a shield or leave.\n\nFlaw 3: Hit reg is pretty terrible. A lot of times, you'll see an enemy blade go straight through you but you take no damage. You will have several moments where you are pretty certain that you cut straight through some other guy. You will find youself saying \"Well that should have been a block\" several times. The hit detection is just bad at times.\n\nUpdate: More flaws? Why not! The kick key just doesn't work at times. I'll have enough stamina and I'm using a keyboard that works but the game goes \"nah, you didn't kick\". Rebound it. Still doesn't want to work when it's supposed to. Suicide key doesn't want to work half the time. Not sure why. Just have to spam it until I eventually die or suicide rush the enemy with fists.

Don't bother buying it.\n\nChivalry is actually really enjoyable when you first start playing. After a certain point, however, you realize that the game is broken beyond reason. When you pass level 15, you are no longer able to play in low level servers. It means you'll be stuck with 1500 hour tryhards who utilize from every possible broken mechanic, glitch, bug and exploit in the game to dominate you. Apparently, instead of fixing their game, the developers have decided to \"include\" everything broken in their game as part of its \"core mechanics\". Because they are too busy developing another equally broken sequel/spin-off. They are still updating the game regularly, however, the patches usually contain community made cosmetic skins, which are sold by real money. Not much bugfixing, not the most important stuff.\n\nWhat's worse is that the game has one of the most toxic communities I have ever seen. Whenever you try to point out the game's flaws, you are mocked. You are insulted. They tell you to \"git gud\" at exploiting or stop playing. You are teamkilled by cancerous trolls that never gets votekicked, and in retaliation, start a votekick against you and usually succeed.\n\nNewer players realize these problems and stop playing the game sooner or later. So, the servers are full of these glitchw***ing \"experts\" who competes in their own p*ssing contest about who exploits the best. Since the game doesn't give you a \"casual player\" space, you'll be stuck in this mess until your growing mental illness prevents you from gaming, or you die of cancer.\n\nIf you buy this game, there are only 2 outcomes:\n1. You'll hate its guts and regret paying even a single dollar for it. You'll most likely uninstall it and never look back.\n2. You'll bite and become a glitchmongering cancerous ballerina yourself.

South Korea\n\nMost Korean players are 3rd person perspective view. 95% Korean players don't use feints because they think feints is a cheat, but they like to spam reversed attacks with a 3rd person perspective view. If someone uses feints on Korean player, the Korean player will cry. Also high rank Korean players like to be on the same team, It isn't hard to see when the Chivalry free weekend happens. Agatha has 10 30+ rank players and Mason's highest rank player is 20s rank. Also, when high rank players get killed by a noob even though it's just a coincidence, They think the noob is a smurf even they killed many more. And I can say Chivalry community is dead in South Korea. Korea has most clans in Asia but all inactive now. Only few Korean players are playing Chivarly these days, but almost every players play only duels in duelyard and few players go China or Japan servers to play team games. Also, they chat too fkin much. (Most chats are not about Chivalry game plays, but sh-it-ta-lks)\n\n2. Japan\n\n99% Japanese players are the 3rd person perspective view. Their average rank is 55, They play feints and often gamble. 3p footworks than parrying. They open a team play server at dinner time and many Japanese players play in there. They don't chat much. When I'm playing in Japanese server, I feel like I'm playing Chivalry Medieval Warfare and other players are playing game \"[url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/362490/Exanima/] Examina\t[/url]\". I often open a server has only First Person Perspective view and Compmod. When Japanese players come over my server, most of them just disconnect or play in with different timid styles than Japanese server. They have 2 clans, but both are inactive now.\n\n3. China\n\nMost Chinese players are 3rd person perspective view and like to spam reversed attack with Zweihander or Messer. Most of them doesn't play feints like Korean players. They have team play servers and duel servers. But internet connection to China from foreign region is too awful, I get high packet loss. Even playing in NA West is better. Most Chinese players started this game late, so their skill is lower than other countries. Will there be a chance for them to be best in Asia? Yes, maybe like 15 years later. Their Team play server has bad balances like Korean server. All 40 + ranks like to stick in the same team and never care about balance. Their 40+ ranks have no skill. They are better than newbies, but it's not skill differences. It's just differences of experiences. It means they are stuck at the certain level, keep playing unbalanced games, spamming 3p reversed attacks.\n\n4. Taiwan\n\nThey don't play feints and they play in foreign servers because they don't have their own server. That's all I know.\n\n5. Philippine\n\nI met only few Filipino players but they play feints and 1st person perspective view. But they are too far from South Korea so didn't play much with them.\n\n5. Other South East Asia\n\nThere are many countries in South East but I don't know the countries of players I met and didn't play with them much due to high ping. One day, 3 arrogant players thought they were the best in Asia and then came to Korean duel server, got rekted like 1-10 kill and did rage quit, went to Chinese server and said \"Korean sucks\".", "timestamp_created": 1480087929, "timestamp_updated": 1512281749, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 15, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.641641020774841309", "comment_count": 17, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22683941": {"recommendationid": "22683941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198078715111", "num_games_owned": 180, "num_reviews": 21, "playtime_forever": 48826, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504813159}, "language": "english", "review": "Had to change my review to not recommend this game.
