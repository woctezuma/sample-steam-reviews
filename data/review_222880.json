If you want to win, you need to be tactical, or you're going to get picked off real fast. The firefights are intensified through audio and visual effects, from the crack of a sniper's bullet, to the hiss of a round passing by your head, to the pings and putters of the bullets hitting the environment around you. The controls are solid, and lend themselves to improve the gamplay (there is lean in this game, use it).

I am going to keep this straight up what i think about it as a whole with no fluff. Short and sweet.\n\nShould you get it? It depends on what type of fps's you like. Many CS players have fell in love with it because they like the realism and they've grown tired of the arcade feel that most other shooters have. Don't doubt it for a second, this game is hard to pick up on but once you do, you realize how well reflexes really help if you're rushing but don't expect to be 360 no-scoping people because there is almost no chance in hell that that will happen. Those with good aim that are looking down sight as you turn a corner will get you every time so this is a game best played instinctively and safe (just don't be one of those snipers that sit at spawn and let the enemy capture everything). There are few grenade, C4, or launcher spots that few people know of and use at the start of some maps which can be frustrating, so that is why I'm really hoping that much larger maps will be released in the future that are more open and don't feel as constrained/guided (Heights and Buhriz are like that but i still love them). Maps that were easy to spawn camp have been updated heavily to prevent that which is great. The devs are absolutely brilliant at balancing and opening new areas of maps, always on top of it so kudos to them. \n\nCommunity engagement is stronger than i've ever seen it, there was a public playtest of player submitted maps that were voted on in hopes of them being added to the game and the rise of The Digital Gaming League is starting their first official Insurgency competitive season with a multitude of teams signed up. \n\nThe Nightfall update just added so much more to the game, it feels totally different than it used to in every good way possible. Noises are made when crossing though brush and leaning, leaning mechanic feels more 'stiff' (meaning not fluidly unnatural), the night vision is spot on and well-balanced, flares look awesome in the night sky, but my only complaint is that the running animations with weapons look kinda wonky now, i preffered it the way it was before but i won't nit-pick things for the sake of the length of this review. Also the new co-op survival is an amazing idea, i could see myself spending hours on that alone with friends. \n\nI could write a list of 10,000 reasons to get this game but none of that could possibly describe the feeling that it would give you if you were playing it yourself. It needs to be experienced, the feelings it gives never dies and that in itself says something. Kills are rewarding, objectives are highly valued, teamwork is vital. You need this game in your life if you are looking for a realistic shooter!\n\n*12/20/14 edited formatting*\n\nNEW UPDATE! 5/3/16\n\n1,290 hours logged, i just can't seem to get enough. New maps, improvements, feautures, etc. OH and a new Insurgency game is coming out soon hell yea! Community is growing steadily, a lot more Pick Up Games (PUG's) than there used to be when i wrote this review for those interested in competitive. My only wish is for ranked competitive matchmaking to exist instead of the typical unranked.

However, that's pretty much all Insurgency has in common with its modern military shooter bretheren. Insurgency is mechanically a very different beast. Let's start with spawns - instead of having reinforcement pools like Battlefield or Red Orchestra, Insurgency uses spawn waves to regulate gameplay flow. It sounds weird, sure, but it works extremely well in practice. \n\nLet's take a basic game mode, Skirmish. Five objective points, conquest style. Each team's closest points to defend are objectives that can be destroyed, which removes them from the map and tightens up the cap order. Each team starts with 2 spawn waves. These spawn waves kick in every 60 seconds or so. Anyone alive by then stays alive, anyone dead by the end of this timer comes back. Every time an objective is captured, another spawn wave is added to the capping team. This means that players are not only incentivized to do objectives in order to extend their own playtime, but it also increases the team's overall effectiveness. It also means that rounds can take a while or be over extremely quickly depending on the degree of teamwork and individual player ability to stay alive.\n\nThe other thing that this game does very well mechanically is its gunfights. In other tactical realism games like Red Orchestra or ARMA, an average engagement is a sniper fest - whoever sees 'em first ends it pretty much instantly. Now don't get me wrong, Insurgency has its share of ingloriously quick deaths and sniping corridors, but an average medium-range gunbattle can often devolve into a stand-up fight involving suppression, repositioning, and grenades, much like a real fight. Part of this is enabled by the fantastic sound design and particle effects - guns are spectacularly loud, a blinding amount of smoke and dust gets kicked up from fully automatic fire, and suppression effects seriously mess with a player's accuracy. Ducking away from a window to have a burst of automatic fire rip up where you were just seconds ago is quite unnerving. Insurgency also seems to be one of the few games that really understands that shooting a real firearm often results in a sort of almost-blindness from the muzzle blast and recoil, which makes attempting to shoot enemies less of a \"line-up-and-click\" moment and more of \"frantically fire in their general direction and hope they don't shoot back\". tl;dr: the guns feel realistic and meaty, and getting shot at is freaky.\n\nWith that said, however, I must be clear with you - Insurgency is NOT a game attempting infantry combat simulation like ARMA or Red Orchestra. The accuracy and damage dealt by the game's large selection of weapons is on par with those kinds of games, but this is also a game tuned for balance and fun. There isn't any superflous mechanics like changing the zeroing on your ironsights or wounding (like RO2 does), but it does make thematic concessions, like fully animated fire selector switches. The inventory and loadout system also emphasizes that it's still very much a game . The end of rounds gives your team Supply Points, which you can then use to build your character's weapons kit. You can equip armor to hopefully increase your survivability by a shot or two, attach a 4x scope to your SKS to plink at range with it, or shunt your points into a slow-handling rocket launcher, which is good for objectives and heavy suppression. There is  no grindy metagame progression system like Call of Duty. It's just the loadout and inventory - all based on your team's performance in and out of rounds. Kind of like Counter-Strike!\n\nAs someone who cut their teeth on games like Red Orchestra, I can say this about Insurgency: it is NOT the most hardcore, realistic shooter I've played, but it is most definitely the most FUN I've had with a realistic team-based shooter! For an early access game, they have a very good product released as of this date (12/29/13). I haven't had a single crash yet, it looks amazing, and runs like a dream! They also have quite a selection of maps and well-balanced gameplay to top it all off. If what I've said sounds good at all to you, go on and get this game, even if it isn't on sale.

The game strips you of most realism shooter mechanics such as a cross hair and simply says hunt or survive. From my point of view it combines all the best features of Counter Strike , Red Orchestra and Arma. This game has a very good sense of realism in that there are no hit indicators to tell you where you've been shot from, it doesn't take many shots to kill - fewer from the neck up - and the only feature that breaks the realism is the small indicators to show you that the person next to you is a teammate, and also where the objectives are. That's it! No radar either, which makes the game even more involving. And friendly fire is always on at any time and it is forgivable. However, I would not recommend this game to people who ONLY like really arcadey shooters like CoD and BF since these two are really casual comparing with Insurgency. But if you really try to explore this game, well I would say you may find much more teamwork and strategies here. What I love the most about this game is how difficult it is, and how it focuses upon tactical play and cooperation with your teammates.

it seems to me that the weight of the item is unbalanced and punishes newer players to an inordinate degree\n\n[h1]LockeProposal's Big Day Out[/h1]\n\n[url=http://steamcommunity.com/groups/bigdayout#]Community Group[/url]\n[url=http://store.steampowered.com/curator/7611703/]Curator Page[/url]\n[url=https://www.reddit.com/r/SeriousSteamReviews/]Serious Steam Reviews subReddit[/url]", "timestamp_created": 1423865240, "timestamp_updated": 1489966908, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 565, "votes_funny": 30, "weighted_vote_score": "0.932990789413452148", "comment_count": 21, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28164717": {"recommendationid": "28164717", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055149982", "num_games_owned": 79, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 2646, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549989122}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is really weird...\n\n\nno crosshair\nno minimap\nno hit feedback\nno red triangles above enemy heads\nno medipacks\nno killcam\nno colorfull weapon skins\nno +100 popping up when kill someone\nno matchmaking\nyou can't call a airstrike after a killstreak\nyou can't aim while crawling\nyou can't bunny hop\nmoving sideways is much slower\nyou don't need to go for the headshot, 2 chest shots with ak/ar are enough to kill\nyou can kill your teammates\nyou have to find a server in a server browser\n\nand so on... so what is this game?\n\nIT'S THE MOST REALISTIC AND INTENSE, BUT STILL FAST PACED AND VERY FUN TO PLAY, MP SHOOTER AVAILABLE.\n\nbest 2$ i've ever spent on steam. can't await insurgency 2.\n\n//edit\n\nthe gameplay is like battlefield3 infantry only hardcore but more realistic (see above + ammo left doesn't stack, every mag is separate. a rocketeer has only one rpg. roles have limited slots so 10 snipers in one team is not possible and so on... ).\n\nbeside the source engine and the fact that you can be oneshoted and have to be very carefull, the gameplay has not much common with CS:GO.\n\nif you play cs:go because you think it's \"realistic\" (it's not:) and you don't really enjoy it - this game is for you.\nif you like bf3 infantry only but want more realism - this game is for you.\n\nif you want to cod akimbo p90 spray and pray run n gun - this game won't make you happy\n\ni hope this answers the questions about the gameplay...", "timestamp_created": 1480783180, "timestamp_updated": 1490357397, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 481, "votes_funny": 70, "weighted_vote_score": "0.912649750709533691", "comment_count": 14, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "19930347": {"recommendationid": "19930347", "author": {"steamid": "76561198058751346", "num_games_owned": 116, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 191626, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1543067741}, "language": "english", "review": "Many of the games at a 60$ price aren't worth that amount. This game is definitely worth MORE than 15. It doesn't matter if it's on sale, you should get this game and tell your friends to get it. Here is why:\n\nI have accumulated over 1,200 hours on this game and have actually founded a competitive insurgency team. It's only fair that I give the game the review it deserves. If you want to know about a lot about the game before you buy it, you're reading the right review.\n\nThe Competitive Scene:\n\nThe competitive scene, while not as big as CSGO, has been mostly developed by the players-many of which have played the game for a long time. These leagues (DGL, ESL, ANZ) spread across every region of the world and have offered regional seasons, tournaments, draft tournaments and even world cups. No matter what region you are from, you can play this game. I've played with guys from South America, America and Canada, Eastern and Western Europe (from the UK to Ukraine), Australia and New Zealand, etc. The game does not boast ten's of thousands of players but the players that play this game in the competitive scene are very dedicated. It is not as hard to learn how to play as it used to be because the game has been allowed to develop and the players have figured out how to play the different maps in general. If you're wondering what \"game type\" the competitive scene revolves around, it's a game mode with 3 points that you can capture, objectives similar to that of the battlefield genre or starwars battlefront. You own one, they start owning one, and then there is a neutral point. If you cap a point, you bring your whole team back. You start with 5 players and they start with 5 players, you fight to the death to kill the other team, using all sorts of strategies and tactics, but also try to potentially cap a point (or bait a cap) and bring the rest of your team back. Sounds fun as hell, right? It's awesome.\n\nGame Types:\n\nIf you're not a competitive guy, there are a ton of game modes to suite your fancy here. Want to play fast paced with 32 people and respawns? Choose Push. Want a slower paced mode much like the one I described for competitive, but with 16 players instead of 10? Choose firefight. Want a mix of Push and Firefight, with points you can capture but also respawn waves? Choose Skirmish. There are a few others as well- ambush for instance puts you on an attacking or defending side, where you are forced to escort your VIP (a player who cannot die) to one of two possible objectives. These are the 4 most common game modes, in that order. \n\nServer Activity:\n\nInsurgency recently broke the record of an all time high in the number of players online at once. No matter what time you get on to play, there are always active servers to play on. \n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is quite different from any other game. It's a lot like the Call of Duty 4 Pro Mod or hardcore mode. You don't have any HUD's or ammunition/health bars. You have your gun in front of you, the time of the round, the points and their status at the bottom of your screen and that's pretty much it. It's a source engine game, a lot of former COD 4 guys and CSGO players like it, although it's not really anything like CSGO.\n\nPace/Mentality/continued comparison:\n\nIt can be pretty fast paced- especially push. There are people everywhere and they're all trying to kill you. Other modes like firefight and ambush can be much slower paced. Yeah, you can go for that initial kill, and if you're good you might get it. The other team might also be playing slowly, and you might pay dearly for a risky move. I'd say it's relatively realistic enough to make it different from COD or Battlefield but still arcady enough to be fun for the guys who like that aspect of games- it's a good balance. Reloading takes a little longer than your average FPS, but not too long. Sound is really huge in this game- you can hear tons of things and when you run around people can hear YOU in the next room. You don't know how many bullets are left in your mag unless you've given it at least a little attention, etc. The game requires a lot of mental attention if you want to do really well, but also is arcady enough to where it's completely in your right to mindlessly shoot virtual people at 3 AM. For instance, you can't really mindlessly play Arma or Squad, but COD or Battlefield doesn't require quite as much mental attention. It's hard to be really good at CSGO- but for different reasons. CSGO is a lot about aim. I'd say it's relatively \"harder\" to be good at insurgency than it is to be \"good\" at Call of Duty or Battlefield, although prior shooter experience certainly helps. The mental aspect of insurgency and attention to detail isn't really found in another shooter. You'll definitely get a new experience here.\n\nWhat are you waiting for!

It's simply about trying to best your opponent.\nAs someone who leads a team of over 30 players into the field, lemme give you a piece of advice. Learn the maps. Knowing where your enemies are most likely to be expected will win, or loose the game for you. Coordinate with your team, this is one of the games where the VoIP feature is realoly an asset instead of a nuisance.  Sound is important - listen to the footsteps around you. Maybe one of the enemy team is distracted enough to call his teammates on the radio close to you, enabling you to hear their strategies.

First, if you're coming from BF3/4, the COD franchise, or CS:GO/S, forget everything you've learned about gun fights. Two, or often one, hit will kill you which means you need to use cover, suppression, smoke, and flash to get around. Gun fights are TENSE - this is partly due to the lethality of weapons, but also the suppression mechanic: you can hear the bullets wizzing by your head, your screen blurs, and if you pop your head out at the wrong time - THWACK, and your dead. \n\nMAPS are expertly designed, consistently updated, lots of variety, and new ones are created suprisingly often for such a small developer.\n\nWEAPONS have character and I've found new favourites for given situations even 100 hours into playing. UNLIKE CS:GO where you have to memorize spray and spread patterns for each weapon, Insurgency weapons perform realistically in that, wherever the sights are pointed, THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE BULLET WILL GO - weapons still recoil, but you know exactly where the bullet is headed when it does. \n\nGAME MODES - brilliant. Co-op is awesome, multiplayer modes are relatively diverse and awesome. What's really unique here is the emphasis on teamplay. You really need to coordinate with your team to win certain modes, whether its popping smoke or having someone cover you while you move up. What sets this game apart, other than everything else, is that players work together here - you're not playing with the silent majority on BF4 or COD - people are on their mics, strategizing and celebrating the game - mostly adults too (well, adults who yell \"Alloha Snackbar\" as terrorists while throwing grenades at American Soldiers, haha). If you get this game, get mic please, you miss out on a lot of the fun and you contribute to making this game less fun for everyone.\n\n[h1] Final Words...[/h1]\n\nOne of my favourite games on PC.

You can shoot from the hip and use iron sights to shoot your targets with one of the game's limited, but extremely lethal weaponary. The game gives you different classes to choose, and each have their own selections of firearms, as well as access to ordonance and other gadgets pertaining to that class. \n\nYou will die. A lot.\n\nWhen you get used to seeing your deaths higher than your highschool grades (does not apply to everyone, of course), you will appreciate the slow pace of the game, and how it forces you to think tactically. You'll be forced into some situations where thinking has to be immediate and accuracy has to be of the highest standard, or else you'll get a bullet to end your pixelated life.\n\nWhether in Co-Op or PVP, Insurgency provides a fun and addicitng shooter experience that keeps you on the egde of your seat, as you hunt down your enemies.\n\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nError 404; Story not found.\n\n\n[h1]Media (Graphics, Sound)[/h1]\n\nThe ambience and atmosphere of Insurgency's maps increase the sense of immersion once the player is dropped into the match. Did you know that only one person on the production team did all the voice acting in the game? His voice is the first you hear once you're thrown unto the fray. Furthermore, the music highlights key moments during a match, whenever your team is lagging behind, or when you're moving forward. It gets even more tense when you have to hold out and protect an objective from enemy counterattack. Adding to this, gunfire sounds are near-perfect to the real life counterparts of the selection of firearms found in-game.\n\nThe exhilirating combination of believable voice acting, gripping atmosphere and the cacophany of bullets everywhere will be sure to have you engaged.\n\n\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nOne of, if not the best realisitc shooter experiences on the market.

You will truly enjoy playing and will always have a sense of fullfiment when you win because communication and coordination with teammates are required to win. This game is worth more than it's asking price. I completely stopped playing CS: GO after I got this. Hopefully more people discover the beauty of this game.\n\nTL, DR:\nAwesome devs.\nAwesome community.\nAwesome game.", "timestamp_created": 1447302406, "timestamp_updated": 1447302406, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 44, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.73597949743270874", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "30583903": {"recommendationid": "30583903", "author": {"steamid": "76561198364256112", "num_games_owned": 241, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 75808, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544001009}, "language": "english", "review": "if you're looking for a semi-realistic first-person shooter, go buy this game!\n\nhere's some information about insurgency:\n[list]\n[*] no crosshair\n[*] no hitmarker\n[*] no healthbar\n[*] no healing\n[*] no radar\n[*] no ammo count\n[*] no kill notification\n[*] no mini map on the HUD\n[*] no enemy damage notification\n[*] no instant respawn\n[*] friendly fire is on\n[*] guns have high recoil\n[*] it takes time to reload\n[*] it takes time to switch weapons\n[*] it takes time to throw an explosive\n[*] you can't aim while crawling\n[*] you can hear the sounds of footsteps\n[*] you can hear the sounds of your breath\n[*] your screen goes blurry when you get shot\n[*] the price is cheap\n[*] the game is stressful\n[*] the game is about teamwork\n[*] get killed with only 1 bullet in the head or chest\n[/list]\n\n7/10 would get killed by an RPG again.", "timestamp_created": 1489814148, "timestamp_updated": 1551259687, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 332, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.901161074638366699", "comment_count": 22, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "41782027": {"recommendationid": "41782027", "author": {"steamid": "76561198101259222", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 23, "playtime_forever": 3649, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549278165}, "language": "english", "review": "Can't wait for Insurgency : Sandstorm.\n\nDespite the game being not that popular, it is actually Amazing.\n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1525124048, "timestamp_updated": 1525124048, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 62, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.816992282867431641", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44913872": {"recommendationid": "44913872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198157996813", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3, "last_played": 1551627837}, "language": "english", "review": "Alright, where do I start...\n\nThis game, Insurgency, is one of the best titles I own in my library, and every day I find myself wanting to come back and feel the gritty pain this game can give. \n\nNow, I'm going to assume, if you're reading this rather than just buying the damn game, you're someone who's spent a lot of their time on CoD or Battlefield and has never really branched out... well, this game is gonna kick your ass and make you eat shit by the time you're done. The game features heavy suppression mechanics, near constant getting-one-shot-by-some-guy-on-mcdonalds-internet-from-across-the-map, and lots of times you wish you had counted how many rounds you were just uncaringly spraying out of your M249. \n\nThis game is great tactical gameplay for a cheap price, and even with the limitations Source has, this game is a wonderful example of tense urban combat that will keep you really wanting to throw out your Apple Earbuds and get a 7.1 surround sound system just so you could hear the guy sneaking up behind you before he brutually filled your spine with .30 caliber bullets. \n\nNow, personally, my favorite part of this whole game is the modding. This game has workshop support, and with such geniuses like Mr. Brightside and Hyper out on the loose, you'll have a plethora of fine weapons to murder terrorists and Marines alike. You'd rather have an L85A2 over your M4A1? Oh yeah, there's a mod for that. Maybe a STEN gun over your Sterling? Yep, you best believe. Perhaps you've got a hankering for Soviet engineering and wanna make every gun in the game a Kalashnikov?

The guns have a nice feeling to them. Gun play is hardcore. Taking down an enemy also feels great. I find myself coming back to it time and time again.\n\nYou usually die in a single shot from whatever weapon unless you are wearing heavy armor. This does a couple of interesting things. You can easily get wallbanged through objects. (Almost everything is wallbangable). You can also get taken out easily if you are running around in the open. These have the effect of constantly keeping you on your toes. It's like the \"hardcore mode\" you can find in other shooters but basically the whole game is like that. I strongly suggest watching some gameplay footage on YouTube, you'll see what I mean.\n\nIt also has a good competitive scene. I have a lot of hours in this game and most of it is playing in competitive mode at the Pick up Games or Scrimmages. These PUGs are held in several discord channels (mostly \"The Gym\" nowadays) and are the next level of gameplay if you have mastered pubs. I strongly suggest trying them if you are slowly getting bored of dominating in public servers. It almost resets all your knowledge and presents a new level of improvement. \n\nBasically you join up, teams are picked and you play a 5v5 in Firefight mode - 20 rounds total, first to 11 wins, you capture the OBJ to spawn dead teammates and have majority control. Analogous to ESEA in CS:GO but more of a community and less organized. Don't worry as people will teach you the map callouts and point you in the right direction. For those who are already familiar with competitive gameplay from other shooters, come try this one, it's sort of unique in it's little ways with plenty of fun.\n\nWith the new game Insurgency: Sandstorm coming out, the scene will probably migrate there but it's still active as of yet. There are even two tournaments that are going to be held in Summer of 2018 - probably the last events for Insurgency 2. \n\nWhether you like pub stomping or more structured competitive gameplay, this game is really fun and worth it at the low price range it's usually offered at. You won't be disappointed.

I've put nearly 100 hours into it and my main thought is why didn't I buy this game earlier. I'd seen it on the store before and just passed on it cause it seemed like some bog standard FPS that i'd spend 20$ on play for a week and never touch again. I couldn't be more wrong. I picked it up while it was on a 3$ sale, my god was it a steal.\n\nThere are two sides, Insurgents and Security. Two different styles of games, COOP or Multiplayer. Personally I don't really play COOP much so I don't know much about it. But the one match of survival on tell I did with about five friends was incredible. Made it to wave 63 in about an hour n a half. Bloody amazing fun.\n\nAs for multiplayer you can play in three different types each with a few different modes, except for competitive. In Sustained Combat you can choose from: Strike, one team tries to destroy three weapons caches while the other team defends. Occupy, both teams try to capture and hold one point in the middle of the map. Push, where one team tries to capture a series of three objectives then destroy a weapons cache at the end. And Skirmish where both teams fight over three objectives each while simultaneously defending their and destroying their enemie's weapons cache. In tactical operations you can choose one of three modes however this one everyone only has one life except for firefight. In ambush one player is the vip and must be escorted to one of two zones and the other team has to stop him. I've honestly never played elimination before so idk what it's about. The last is firefight where there are three objectives, however you only can respawn if your team takes an objective while you're dead. The last game type, Unranked Competitive is a 5v5 version of firefight.\n\nNow onto the guns n shit. Well for starters it's asymetrical balance that actually fucking works. Security can only use Security guns and the tererrists can only use tourist guns. Weapons range from the AK-74U to the MP5K to the fucking M1 Carbine. Each class has different loadouts however it stays fairly simple. MGer get MGs, riflemen get M16s or AKs, snipers get bolt actions and semi auto battle rifles, and engineers get shotguns and SMGs. Now there are a lot more roles than the ones I listed and there is overlap but that's basically it. All of the guns are useable unlike many other games. I've seen people go ham with the MP40 as much as I've seen amazing killstreaks with the UMP-45. You can choose from shitloads of different attachments, optics and ammunition types. You can also choose from 4 different grenades, C4/IED or RPG/AT4. You can also take light, heavy or no armor at all. Most everything will be a one burst kill so it pays to be accurate.\n\nNow for the maps. Holy shit. There are some absolutely amazing maps: Ministry, Embassy, Verticality, Panj, Kandagal, Siege, Tell, Station. The list goes on and on. Maps range from complete urban combat like Ministry to entire rural like Panj and many have a mix of both. Maps are also asymmetrical. Certain maps Insurgents get to this objecive faster or this map Security gets there four seconds faster. Still all of the maps are very well designed and I haven't found one that I absolutely dislike, even Buhriz which this community for some reason loves.\n\nRandom shit about the game. Currently the game is run on Source so it's a bit dated but works very well for potatos. Next year the Devs are planning on introducing Insurgency Sandstorm which will be on Unreal 4. The community is rather small which is the biggest problem. It's not so bad that you can't find a match but if you have a group of say 6 people and are looking to play a specfic mode with a populated server it may be a challenge. The community quality is about as good as you'd expect. I've met some really nice people, but honestly, it's 10$ there's lots of idiots around and lots of people who really don't have much FPS skill. There are also two announcers one for each side. The Insurgent one is okay, a bit bog standard. But the Security one, oh man. He's fucking hilarious.

The weapons and setting feel very authentic, the sound design makes every bullet flying past your head terrifying, and the damage model means that getting shot HURTS. There will be times when you die and you don't even know where the shot came from, and times when you've shot into a room or alley, and THINK you've killed your target, but aren't SURE you've hit anything. You take a step, not really wanting to move forward. Suddenly a grenade flies out of the dark room, and with no time to react, you're dead. The tension and terror feel very real. It sounds overly dramatic to say, but playing this game gives me a tiny sense of how real life military personnel end up with PTSD.\n\nGameplay is solid, with most action happening in the PVP matches, but the Co-Op mode is also very solid, with you and a small squad of other players cautiously advancing toward an objective. Even once you've learned when and where Co-Op attacks will happen, there's something gripping about you and a few human players trying to survive a rush of incoming attackers.\n\nOn a closing note, I really appreciate that a game set mostly in the Middle East doesn't descend into the standard \"Americans=good, Arabs=evil\" cliche. For instance, when playing as an insurgent and starting the match, you'll often hear your character yell things like \"Let us push this invaders from our homeland!\" The game doesn't celebrate or denigrate any of its characters, it just soberly presents the conflict between them, and captures the terrifying, violent desperation to survive.", "timestamp_created": 1484169893, "timestamp_updated": 1484169952, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 76, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.853419721126556396", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "26624524": {"recommendationid": "26624524", "author": {"steamid": "76561197987332546", "num_games_owned": 564, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 3422, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1546713234}, "language": "english", "review": "A more realistic FPS than most others.

I can tell you now that this game is unique to a large extent, but also quite flawed but fun still.\nThis game has two categories of modes, Sustained and Tactical combat. I tend to mainly play Tactical combat.\nTactical combat is anything where you only have one life per a round by default such as Firefight, Elimination, Ambush ect. Sustained combat is for the much more chaotic style of gameplay where M249's set up firing arc's, RPG's fly everywhere, grenade launchers are used and it's just pure chaos. You get to spawn multiple times, and it's very fun for a lot of people but it doesn't suit me as much and so I will be mainly talking about this game from the point of view of some one who spent a lot of time playing firefight and in particular 5v5 Firefight.\n\nI spent over 700 hours playing Firefight in this game mode and I would suggest you to as well because of the clutch situations that Insurgency lends itself to. Your team controls one point, and the other team controls a point and then there is the neutral point, Bravo or B.\nYou are able to do some very intelligent things such as stepping on a point for a second or two to bait an enemy away from a very powerful position to help your team or to just bait them to kill them. The players who are not on a point can't tell how far captured a point is and so intuition comes into decision making a lot, and being able to communicate with your team how far captured a point is, and if you are stopping the enemy team capture or not ect.\n\nDespite all of this, and there are a lot of other things that are exciting in this game that compel me to play it, but there are some base underlying reasons for advising against getting it at full price.\n\nFor one, the 5v5 community that understands callouts, the mechanics of Firefight, the meta ect is minute, at only 100 or so. A lot of people have left and haven't returned because the game is just so buggy in a lot of respects and the developers have moved onto Sandstorm and Day of Infamy. The bugs are mainly to do with the hitboxes and hit registration, and this has been a continious issue that never was resolved. Keep this in mind when playing and shots aren't landing.\n\nSecondly, the developers never delivered upon their promise of 5v5 ranked matchmaking. If that is something that would have appealed, it isnt' in. On the other hand a friend of mine, Outlawled, has been kind enough to actually develop a third party application for matchmaking through Java and so when that is open for testing, we will have a matchmaking source.\n\nIn conclusion if you are looking for a more hardcore FPS than CoD, Battlefield or anything else in that realm of being quite casual, then this will be for you. You die in 1-2 shots from nearly any range, and it is quite fun. Despite this, I will insist that this game is not realistic. If you are coming from Arma 3, VBS (highly unlikely as very few individuals have a working legal copy), Squad or Project reality, do not expect this to be realistic in the vanilla version.", "timestamp_created": 1493803201, "timestamp_updated": 1493803201, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 58, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.772677838802337646", "comment_count": 3, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "24297475": {"recommendationid": "24297475", "author": {"steamid": "76561197960320354", "num_games_owned": 294, "num_reviews": 19, "playtime_forever": 69101, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1471882620}, "language": "english", "review": "The most exciting, immersive, fun, and lethal multiplayer FPS I have ever played.\n\nThe Battlefield...\n\nIf I had one word to describe the experience, it's TACTICAL. First, if you're coming from BF3/4, the COD franchise, or CS:GO/S, forget everything you've learned about gun fights. Two, or often one, hit will kill you which means you need to use cover, suppression, smoke, and flash to get around. Gun fights are TENSE - this is partly due to the lethality of weapons, but also the suppression mechanic: you can hear the bullets wizzing by your head, your screen blurs, and if you pop your head out at the wrong time - THWACK, and your dead.\n\nMAPS are expertly designed, consistently updated, lots of variety, and new ones are created suprisingly often for such a small developer.\n\nWEAPONS have character and I've found new favourites for given situations even 100 hours into playing. UNLIKE CS:GO where you have to memorize spray and spread patterns for each weapon, Insurgency weapons perform realistically in that, wherever the sights are pointed, THAT IS EXACTLY WHERE THE BULLET WILL GO - weapons still recoil, but you know exactly where the bullet is headed when it does. \n\nGAME MODES - brilliant. Co-op is awesome, multiplayer modes are relatively diverse and awesome. What's really unique here is the emphasis on teamplay. You really need to coordinate with your team to win certain modes, whether its popping smoke or having someone cover you while you move up. What sets this game apart, other than everything else, is that players work together here - you're not playing with the silent majority on BF4 or COD - people are on their mics, strategizing and celebrating the game - mostly adults too (well, adults who yell \"Alloha Snackbar\" as terrorists while throwing grenades at American Soldiers, haha). If you get this game, get mic please, you miss out on a lot of the fun and you contribute to making this game less fun for everyone.\n\nFinal Words...\n\nOne of my favourite games on PC. Kudo's to a great development team who keep this game alive with frequent updates and tourneys. They obviously have a passion for what they do, and it's part of what makes this game great.\n\nIt also happens to have a total conversion mod for my first multiplayer FPS (TPS*) addiction, Socom 1 & 2 ( \"Socom: Source\" ).", "timestamp_created": 1468423536, "timestamp_updated": 1468423536, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 105, "votes_funny": 15, "weighted_vote_score": "0.825899243354797363", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": true, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48354125": {"recommendationid": "48354125", "author": {"steamid": "76561198271404496", "num_games_owned": 19, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 1192, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548199114}, "language": "english", "review": "And you thought peeking in CS:GO is hard. \n<peek>\n<die>\nWelcome to Insurgency, it is about time I welcome you to one of the most rage inducing games in the world.\nNo hackers (Amen to that)\nYou are actually \nPROUD when you get in a kill.

Especially support classes would benefit from this, as their main role is to lay down surpression fire over long distances. Maybe make it so if you get surpressed, you start to yell more, giving away your position, and maybe being more innacurate)\n-Maybe make it so, when you are being surpressed or in adrenaline rush, you reload faster or something?\n-When you aim down sights while standing for too long, your hands get tired and your sights/scopes start to sway (depending on gun weight. (This will help against rpg's maybe?)\n-Clips for Mosin?\n-More voice interaction\n-Make it so when you are in need to switch to your handgun/get a grenade you can drop your weapon instead of holsting it then slowly taking out your throwable/gun. Maybe we will see inclusion of shoulder gun belts?\n-More voice interaction please\n\nOverall, I rate this game 8.9/10\n \nAlso, props to /k/ for suggestions\n\nEDIT: \n-Guns are noisy as fuck in real life, especially LMG's, sniper rifles and shotguns indoors. If you keep spamming that LMB you will probably get some ear disease. Add earpro as a accessory. This will also make surpressors more useful (by the way, surpressors DON'T make the gun go \"phoosh\". They're still loud).\n-Make going prone faster, like plunching yourself on your belly, when getting fired at\n-Muzzle flashes are a big deal when shooting at night.\n\nEDIT 2:\n-Add a .357 revolver that you can load either .357 rounds or .38spc rounds (obviously, the 357rounds will do more damage but will kick a lot more, and the .38spc rounds will have much less recoil (due to the low power and gun weight) but will damage less, making it a good hit-and-run weapon maybe?\n-Maybe add so you can adjust grain ammount in bullets, maybe make a Hollow point +P abomination rifle that will one-shot unarmored opponents?", "timestamp_created": 1481570025, "timestamp_updated": 1484069167, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 337, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.863683938980102539", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "31927160": {"recommendationid": "31927160", "author": {"steamid": "76561198074867492", "num_games_owned": 413, "num_reviews": 105, "playtime_forever": 1992, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1454609461}, "language": "english", "review": "[table]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b]Title[/b][/td]\n        [td]Insurgency[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b]Developer[/b][/td]\n        [td]New World Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n    [tr]\n        [td][b]Publisher[/b][/td]\n        [td]New World Interactive[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[tr]\n        [td][b]Release[/b][/td]\n        [td]22 January 2014[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[tr]\n        [td][b]Graphics[/b][/td]\n        [td]3D[/td]\n    [/tr]\n [tr]\n        [td][b]Genre[/b][/td]\n        [td]FPS[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[tr]\n        [td][b]Price[/b][/td]\n        [td]\u20ac9,99[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[tr]\n        [td][b]Rating[/b][/td]\n        [td][b]8.5[/b]/10[/td]\n    [/tr]\n[/table]\n\n[h1]The game.[/h1]\n[i]Insurgency[/i] is a rich and deep tactical FPS with a heavy focus on teamwork and tactics. Developed by New World Interactive and released in 2014. After a few years in the process of improvement, it\u2019s one of the current best FPS in the market. The price is too attractive, towards the quality that the game presents. This FPS is a mix of the two of the better online tactical shooters: [i]Counter-Strike[/i] and [i]Red Orchestra[/i]. \n\n[h1]Gameplay.[/h1]\nThe game seems too normal where there are two teams, the classic push/conquest/objective style game types, and guns. However, there is more than seems be. [i]Insurgency[/i] is mechanically different of others popular known FPS games.\n\nIf you usually play COD or BF and enjoy these styles, then [i]Insurgency[/i] isn't for you. It's a game for those who like difficulty. The sights, the aim, the recoil, everything is heavier. \n\nPeople that start play this game will said [i]Insurgency[/i] is bad or strange, I guess. The recoil is totally different than CS:GO. Anyway, CS:GO is more popular but in these terms, I think [i]Insurgency[/i] is more realistic. The game is really realistic and unpredictable how bullets can kill an enemy with one shot through a wall, and it makes matches a challenge. If you stand staying in one place for too long, that's can be a problem, forget that. After a while, you'll realise that [i]Insurgency[/i] have entirely different gameplay mechanics than COD or BF.\n\nThe controls are solid and the game offers to you one of the most intense firefight games I have played. They're intensified through really good audio and visual effects, that make a spetacular environment around you.\n\n[i]Insurgency[/i] is a truly tactical FPS. The teamplay here is more important than in any FPS. Don't think about running through the open countryside. If you want to win, you need to be tactical, otherwise, you'll be quickly discovered.\n\nGraphically talking, [i]Insurgency[/i] is appealing, particularly the detail put into the guns is extremely well done.\n\nInstead of having reinforcement pools like BF, [i]Insurgency[/i] uses spawn waves to regulate gameplay flow. It can sounds weird, but it works extremely well in practice. \n\nThe game offers a nice customization to your weapons, everything is unlocked, so that there is no level up.\n\nThe maps are amazing, sort of based in places like Israel and that. [i]Insurgency[/i] removed the massive maps and endless walking that features [i]Arma[/i], e.g., delivering a fast-paced, intelligent FPS game unlike anything in the market. It's an amazing game in almost every way I can think of. Don't expect kill cam, no crosshairs, no radar, no medic or healing. No enemy damage notification. Totally hardcore.\n\n[h1]Modes.[/h1]\nThe game offers a several game modes to chose from and they're well-made, too. You can play on solo (with bots, against bots), and it's the same game modes as Co-Op (with people vs. bots), some of which are: Hunt (prettty much kill a certain number of people and blow up a cache), Survival (cap points to gain the in-game currency which you buy weapons with; however this in-game currency is different to the in-game currency is CS:GO), and so on. There is a timer between spawns, but it goes fairly quick, so don't worry. You can spectating your friends that is still entertaining.\n\nOn multiplayer there is all the gamemodes like Firefight and Ambush, which are preetty much king of the hill but harder and protecting a vip until he reaches a certain point. Sometimes, this game really forces you to trust your instincts and your teammates due to the lack of information.\n\n[h1]Excellent community commitment.[/h1]\nThe community is overall good. There are people who help you, who communicate with you to fulfill the goal, that give you support, is good.\n\nAbout the commitment to the game, the community engagement is strong. The players submit maps that will be voted on in hopes of them being added to the game. New maps, improvements and features are added with a positive frequency.\n\n[quote][h1]Positive points.

Team communication and your own eyes is everything you have in this game. Thanks to this the gameplay is very unique and very different and I really like it.\n\nThe performance and optimization in general (SteamOS / Linux) is excellent altough Steam has some problems with detecting in-game status (easy workaround/solution - run \"chmod 644 crash_handler\" in your insurgency2 folder).\n\nI can fully recommend Insurgency to anyone.

I've been told this game is just a standalone upgrade of the Source Insurgency Mod and I'm very sad face that I missed that gem. Hands down the best infantry game(not too sim not too arcadey) I've ever seen / played. It still runs on the Source engine so you won't be see amazing graphics but the upside is that the source engine can run on a potato so you can still run 200+ fps with ease (in case you want to take advantage of the client speed being slightly faster with higher fps even though your monitor won't render past the 60/120 refresh rate).\n\nInterface wise, It's the closest thing to minimally immersive that I've seen in a shooter. You get the basic UI showing what points are capped, your fire mode on your weapon, and how many magazines you have left (It won't show you current ammo so you have to estimate how much you have fired from the current mag). The weapons you carry will appear in the fade-out box only when you switch weapons like usual. No minimap showing you where the enemies or your teammates are so you have to figure it out for yourself, be it the bullets flying by to clock your enemies position, or calling out through voip to make sure no friendly fire happens when you cross flanks. There is a label on your teammates to give you that little help in deciding who is friendly though if you pay attention (hopefully they will add a server option to disable this).\n\nThe bullet count is even realistic, which so many other shooters try to simplify. The magazines left are just that, magazines. There is no magical extra pouch that you dump the unused rounds to somehow top off the last mag you have, so you have to decide if you want to top off or risk running out of rounds mid firefight, although for some reason you get an absurd amount of spare mags. The mags you replaced without being empty will actually go the bottom of your stash, then when you get to them you end up shooting like 2 rounds then having to switch mags again. Kind of annoying but kind of an awesome way to use up the unspent rounds when you are low on ammo.\n\nNow I'm not a fan of free-aim (where your gun isn't locked in place on the center of the screen) but it fits so perfectly in this kind of game. It isn't overly done like in RO2's full screen free-aim, there is a deadzone that will free-aim, then turn when you reach the edges. It will force you to ADS (also not a fan of in other games) if you need the accuracy, which also isn't ridiculously instant like in other action shooters(visual delay only); and the movement in ADS mode will actually sway instead of snap making OP drag shot a little less potent. The free-aim deadzone is pretty realistic, giving you realistic accuracy, and rewarding you for instinct shooting from high ready. There is also emphasis on crouching in front of teammates so you don't get shot in the back, prone to get better cover, or even feigh death behind cover (there is no kill confirmation). The realism really has a Red Orchestra feel to it but in a modern setting.\n\nThe respawn system really makes you value your life because anyone who dies won't respawn until your team has captured a point or the next wave comes in sustained mode, which also encourages grouping up instead of just running, gunning, and dieing. So the gameplay may seem slow at first because of this but that all changes when you get into a fire-fight. From calling out where enemies are, to staying behind cover and watching bullets wiz past your head. You really feel like you are in the thick of it. The maps are extremely well made, there are multiple places you can fire from (lots of buildings with windows and cover) and encourage teamplay even more with a common tactic being team A advances while team B covers and suppress fire or throw smoke to rush. The maps can feel a bit asymmetrical but this is infantry realism, you are not always going to be on equal terms.\n\nRecommended that you have a mic on the ready because the VOIP is pretty crucial in communication. It's somewhat positional audio so it's easier to tell who is talking just by the direction of the voice; but beware, enemies can hear you too if you are too close to them, positional audio is just that. It will also help when flanking, calling it out so you don't get murdered by your own team when you come around a corner.\n\nAlso, don't expect neglectful devs. The devs for this game are very involved and determined to make this game happen. I've even run into a few devs while playing and constantly responding to forum posts, so it's not like they are going to easily give up on a game they actually play.", "timestamp_created": 1388200125, "timestamp_updated": 1392663498, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 196, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864625394344329834", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "43696930": {"recommendationid": "43696930", "author": {"steamid": "76561197988940377", "num_games_owned": 350, "num_reviews": 5, "playtime_forever": 49119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1544397961}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Flawed, relatively simple and not really innovative by now, but more than recommended at the current full price (\u20ac9.99) because of the excellent gun action and mostly nice maps[/h1]\n\n[b]General info for potential buyers' benefit: what you get is a slow-paced, relatively hard PvP and coop shooter which is much less casual than Call of Duty or Battlefield, but it's far from being a milsim like Squad or Arma. You can die from a single shot. There's no vehicles or XP system. You fight the same enemy infantry type the whole time as there's only two factions. On vanilla servers you play with eight players in a team. The setting is Middle-Eastern, reminiscent of the early 2000s Iraq and Afghanistan wars.[/b]\n\n[u]What could be improved, mostly from a coop mode POV:[/u][list]\n[*]Some game modes aren't really worth playing IMO: outpost for instance (defence against the same waves of the same old enemies) can potentially go on forever, but at level 50 you don't really feel like you've achieved anything. In conquest you have to kill endless waves of enemies and hold three objectives at the same time, it's impossible to complete with a lowly populated server and the 8 player limit doesn't help.\n\n[*]There's no sense of progression, no XP to gain.\n\n[*]AI of bots is still terribly broken: sometimes they do nothing at all while you shoot at them, other times they're terminators with aimbot. Smoke is OP as the slightest puff of smoke in their vicinity makes them completely blind. It's absolutely possible to just stock up on smoke grenades, not even select guns and get far by just throwing smokes and knifing enemies. The bots have their own OP tool: the RPG, which they like spamming the whole time resulting in simultaneously frustrating and hilarious game overs.\n\n[*]Maps only allow full movement in some game modes. In most coop modes which are nonetheless worth playing the play zones are tiny and the allowed play zones don't always make sense. Situations like bots around the corner know the team is there and they're throwing grenades, but the game doesn't allow me to peek around the corner and shoot them. The devs have fiddled with the layout of the maps over the years, which can be good, but sometimes they should have left things as they were.\n\n[*]Minor glitches remain, some of which are funny. Hovering and/or T-posing characters, people holding a rifle and pistol that are fused together, invisible fires. Every now and then hitboxes refuse to register clear hits. It can get janky sometimes.\n\n[*]I've seen a medic class added on custom servers, I feel like it's a missed opportunity to include it in the main game as the only difference between classes now is some of the main weapons and explosives you can select. Some of the classes are also very circumstantial, on most maps you feel useless as a sniper and select the good old M16 instead. Some classes can get a better kit than others with the same amount of points (compare the cost of the M4 for \"recon\" and \"rifleman\" for example).\n\n[*]The game isn't that fancy or pretentious about what it's trying to accomplish with nice visuals and effects, so objects in the environment can't be destroyed and the physics aren't that impressive.\n\n[*]Servers should automatically kick inactive players.\n\n[*]Circumstantial negative: since the game went free, there's been an influx of trolls and cheaters.\n[/list]\nP.S. Some of this is fixed in the next game Day of Infamy by the same devs, while other things linger on, so if these things concern you, look into Day of Infamy.\n\n[u]Why the thumbs-up:[/u][list]\n[*]It does well what a shooter is supposed to be good at: the gun action, ballistics, how guns behave, attachments for guns, simulating environments realistically where recent wars in the Middle-East were fought, this game nails it well if you take into account it's an indie game from 2014. After 760 hours I still like shooting bots and other players. It's relatively simple once you get over the short learning curve but hard and team focused, with a hint of more tactical gameplay.\n\n[*]It's more satisfying if you're looking for a military experience than games like CoD or BF and at the same time getting into a quick match for twenty minutes is easier than the devotion and seriousness which Squad and Arma require. It fits a certain niche for days when you're not feeling up to playing a real milsim and communicating and cooperating with a huge team simulating military hierarchy and different tasks.\n\n[*]Custom servers make this game better still and more complex.\n\n[*]I would be more positive about it than I already am if I played PvP modes more as this game lends itself well for competitive gameplay.", "timestamp_created": 1532345809, "timestamp_updated": 1534957489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 88, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820828080177307129", "comment_count": 7, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18722425": {"recommendationid": "18722425", "author": {"steamid": "76561197963307637", "num_games_owned": 1186, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 24717, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1536549432}, "language": "english", "review": "Insurgency has one of the most authentic FPS experiences I've ever had the pleasure of playing.

But seriously, when the devs talk about realism on this game, they mean it. With that being said, this is an FPS I'm terrible at, but I will give you an honest review.\n\nThe Gameplay:\n\nThere's a variety of gameplay types, but I won't go into detail because the essence of the game is basically the same in all of them. For example:\n\n-Cover matters on this game, and if you have played other FPS games that stressed the importance of cover, this game will probably stress the importance of cover even more. Forget running around aimlessly and looking for someone to kill. You definitely won't be going up the scoreboard using that approach. \n\n-Staying hidden and scanning the area is very, very important even if you're not a sniper. If you don't know your surroundings, you're going to get killed by the person who does. Staying hidden and waiting for the right time to shoot is also an aspect of this game you need to apply. You'll have to station yourself in buildings, hide behind rocks, anything that hides you from plain sight. The people who get the most kills on this game are the ones who know how to think tactical. It's not about how good you are at COD. It's about how well you can apply tactics. \n\n-You can die in much fewer hits than on most shooters. While it is possible for players to take quite a few bullets in the torso (depending on the armor, that is), for the most part you can die in as little as one shot from a pistol. Keep in mind if you're not used to this type of playing, chances are you may find this game unappealing. \n\nNevertheless, this mechanic allows the game to keep its tactical gameplay, forcing players to use cover rather than just running around like headless chickens on a rampage. \n\n-Lastly, teamwork is very important.\n\nThe cons of this game:\n\n-You can die very fast. While some people might not mind this, I honestly don't think it's that fun to get killed by your enemy without even having a chance to react. Yes, you saw me saying earlier that dying fast on this game is a good thing. It can also be a bad thing imo. I wouldn't mind if players were given a bit more HP but not too much. That's basically all I got to say. Is it a bad con? No, it's not really a bad one at all. More like a minor nuisance.\n\n-Almost every server I try to join only plays on game mode called VIP. On VIP mode, one team has a special person, hence the name VIP, that they must escort to a checkpoint. The other team must defend their two checkpoints and kill the VIP before they can escape. It's not a bad game, but it gets really boring if it's the only game mode people are interested in.\n\nConclusion:\n\nIt's realistic and very fun to play, and while it does have only two annoying cons, I'd say this is a great game that you should consider buying if you're sick and tired of all the other FPS games out there that are all about running around like a complete moron and mindlessly firing bullets to get as many kills as possible. \n\nIn short, using your brains will make you better at this game than your itching trigger finger.", "timestamp_created": 1489799818, "timestamp_updated": 1489799818, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 94, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.869609296321868896", "comment_count": 5, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "27761176": {"recommendationid": "27761176", "author": {"steamid": "76561198144686859", "num_games_owned": 143, "num_reviews": 10, "playtime_forever": 4205, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1504855704}, "language": "english", "review": "Think of CS:GO without purchasing skins, non-toxic community, more realism and [b]much more fun[/b].", "timestamp_created": 1480212337, "timestamp_updated": 1480212337, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 100, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.815906286239624023", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "37787020": {"recommendationid": "37787020", "author": {"steamid": "76561198317879573", "num_games_owned": 359, "num_reviews": 29, "playtime_forever": 128488, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1541949888}, "language": "english", "review": "I can't understand this game! it's shit\nJust go and shoot everyone u see XD It will be fun :3", "timestamp_created": 1511793449, "timestamp_updated": 1511793449, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 34, "votes_funny": 27, "weighted_vote_score": "0.798679888248443604", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "12966423": {"recommendationid": "12966423", "author": {"steamid": "76561198026575104", "num_games_owned": 1455, "num_reviews": 390, "playtime_forever": 66, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1416138337}, "language": "english", "review": "OMG... no crosshair!\nOMG... no minimap!\nOMG... you can't tell who is friend and who is foe!\nOMG... no HP indicator!\nOMG... there is no instant spawn!\nOMG... you die easily!\nOMG... so hardcore!\n______________\nOMG... it is perfect!", "timestamp_created": 1416138551, "timestamp_updated": 1416138551, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 365, "votes_funny": 224, "weighted_vote_score": "0.83550417423248291", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "2117003": {"recommendationid": "2117003", "author": {"steamid": "76561198002534054", "num_games_owned": 1071, "num_reviews": 40, "playtime_forever": 70843, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1538522544}, "language": "english", "review": "I started playing Insurgency: Modern Infantry Combat many, many years ago as a mod. As soon as I heard they were making a standalone, I bought it without thinking twice. Throughout early access, the developers listened to what the community had to say, and made changes accordingly. I have heard the developers say several times that they 'made it to play it.' This is the best mindset a developer could have, and it shows. Even though the kickstarter for Insurgency failed, the developers managed to keep it alive long enough to enter early access on steam. Their dedication to this game is really amazing.\n\n\tThe game has a minimal HUD, meaning your screen isn't cluttered up with useless things, such as a minimap. They also implemented a 3D VOIP system that allows you to hear anyone, including the enemy, at a realistic distance. If you decide to talk to a squad member over the radio and an enemy just so happens to be on the other side of a doorway, god bless. It requires a good amount of teamwork and communication in order to win. \n\nThere are a large amount of original game modes. Some of these modes were taken directly from the mod (such as Push), and some are brand new (Ambush). All of the game modes are original, and are mostly based off of capturing points, rather than getting kills.\n\n\tOne of the main problems I had with Red Orchesta 2 was the super clunky movement controls. This game has very smooth controls, but still manages to keep it medium paced. You will find it necessary to rush a corner sometimes, and other times you may need to wait for the enemy to move up. Running and gunning in this game is very, very hard to do. \n\n\tWhen Insurgency was released from early access, the developers decided that it was in their best interest to LOWER THE PRICE. Games that come out of early access usually RAISE their prices, but the developers of Insurgency decided to cut the price down and increase the playerbase. If that's not dedicated, I don't know what is. \n\n\tThis game is easily up there with the $60 games, and you can get it for 15 bucks or less.

The learning curve at first glance is hard to get your way around. But once you come to grips on how to play the game as a whole it is overwhelmingly enjoyable for a tactical 1st person shooter, the mechanics are smooth, reasonably optimized, well and though out map/layout design and satisfying to gun down the Tallibans in general. Even if you do manage to believe the game is getting staled for you, there are always workshop mods that you could download, such as weapon/attatchment reskins, new maps, playermodels, graphic fidelity related mods etc. Or even find custom servers that overhaul the gameplay experience of Insurgency to make it fast or slower paced.\nInsurgency is a game that I just keep coming back to from time and time again because of these reasons. Thus concludes my points on why you should pick up this game now at full price or on sale, as either way you're getting a bang for a buck.\n\n[h1] [b] - [/b] [/h1]\nNot to say that Insurgency is a perfect game, no indeed. Having a games core mechanic work well is one side of the spectrum, the other side is having a wecoming and friendly community. Insurgency at most times in [u] public spacing [/u] [b] DOES NOT [/b] demonstrate this, as public servers tend to attract the worst of individuals, where kids, teenagers and adults are on the same page for being childishly immature and sour as people in general, wherever it's demonstrated through ingame voice chat, or deciding to purposely troll the team through killing team members.\nSpawn camping can also become a frequent/frustrating issue that you may encounter when playing PVP on official/non-official servers. In addition, the game itself is not punishing for choosing to \"run n gun\", thereby making the game feel extremely casual rather than tactical at certain times.\n\n[h1] [b] !

Lastly, the most important of all... we are a community that promotes the idea of being respectful and inclusive to others around us allowing the group as a whole to abolish the meaning of toxicity from within the battalion. \n\nhttps://www.redeye1striflescompany.com/\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/groups/REDi1R", "timestamp_created": 1541865810, "timestamp_updated": 1541867587, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 27, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.748642146587371826", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "9058901": {"recommendationid": "9058901", "author": {"steamid": "76561198071467683", "num_games_owned": 102, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 192643, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550262078}, "language": "english", "review": "This is the best infantry based FPS out right now.  Period.  Before I begin, if you liked America's Army 2.x or Red Orchestra 2, you can skip my review and just buy it now.\n\nInsurgency combines highly deadly weapons (1-2 hits across the board for the most part) with Squad based combat.  Unlike games like Call of Duty, you choose a role on a fireteam and certain weapons and equipment are available to you, while others are not.  This promotes teamwork which you otherwise wouldn't get in games where every player can equip themselves as a one man army.\n\nThere is no crosshair to help you to fire from the hip.  And players can't put a dot on their screen to cheat their way around that, since your gun moves independently of your screen to a certain extent.  This makes firing from the hip that much difficult, but also more rewarding if you can pull it off.\n\nThe maps feel immersive and set in Middle Eastern environments ranging from Iraq to Afghanistan.  They aren't the shoebox style maps present in other mainstream FPS, but shaped and structured like real cities or outposts that you'd find in that part of the world.\n\nIn most game modes, your team will respawn in waves based on capturing objectives.  There is no run and gun team deathmatch mode here.  Nor are there killstreaks, perks, or other rewards to help bad players.  When you die it will be your fault, not some UAV or airstrike.\n\nYou'll die a little bit before you get the hang of it because it's unlike anything you've played before.  But once you master it (I've seen friends of mine get good over the course of a day), this is the most rewarding FPS you'll ever play.\n\nIt only costs $15 but is easily worth $60, IMO.\n\n[h1]Update: About this BattlEye stuff[/h1]\nTwo years and over 2,000 hours later... still love the game.  But about this BattlEye stuff on the front page... \n\nThe developers conducted multiple polls over the years to gauge what their playerbase wanted.  More weapons?  Got em.  More maps?  Got that too.  Mac and Linux support?  Done.  Performance improvements? Yep.  Anticheat?  Finally, yes.  We asked for it, it took some time, and we got it.\n\nSo what's with all these negative reviews about BattlEye?  On a technical level, it's not accessing or doing anything that VAC or any other anticheats aren't already doing.  So what's with the hate?  I don't mean to paint with a broad brush here, but consider GabeN's comments about the attacks people make against VAC...\n\n\"There is also a social engineering side to cheating, which is to attack people's trust in the system. If \"Valve is evil - look they are tracking all of the websites you visit\" is an idea that gets traction, then that is to the benefit of cheaters and cheat creators. VAC is inherently a scary looking piece of software, because it is trying to be obscure, it is going after code that is trying to attack it, and it is sneaky. For most cheat developers, social engineering might be a cheaper way to attack the system than continuing the code arms race, which means that there will be more Reddit posts trying to cast VAC in a sinister light.\"\n- https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1y70ej/valve_vac_and_trust/\n\nSo take that into consideration when you see people coming out of the blue bashing Insurgency for adding something literally everyone was asking for.", "timestamp_created": 1392162279, "timestamp_updated": 1490932606, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 46, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.756050050258636475", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "28487811": {"recommendationid": "28487811", "author": {"steamid": "76561198304060785", "num_games_owned": 192, "num_reviews": 32, "playtime_forever": 43, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1464632858}, "language": "english", "review": "> Joined a server\n> A random dude in the insurgency team keeps trowing grenades and yelling allahu ackbar in mic\n> Other dude keeps playing arabic music\n\nSo far so good", "timestamp_created": 1482247731, "timestamp_updated": 1482247731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 362, "votes_funny": 633, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846205651760101318", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "18468651": {"recommendationid": "18468651", "author": {"steamid": "76561197975322649", "num_games_owned": 122, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 36685, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1533901036}, "language": "english", "review": "Quite possibly the best FPS I've played in years.

(Melee weapons are better than shotguns lol)\nHere are all the weapons listed:\n\n--------------------Security Forces-----------------------Insurgent Forces---\nSMGs-------- \u2022MP5K ,\u2022UMP-45------------------------\u2022MP40,\u2022Sterling\nCarbines-----\u2022AC-556 \u2022 Mk18 \u2022 M4A1-----------------\u2022 M1 Carbine \u2022 SKS \u2022 AKS-74U\nAssault rifles--\u2022M16A4 \u2022 Galil SAR--------------------\u2022 AKM \u2022 AK-74 \u2022 Galil\nBattle rifles----\u2022L1A1 SLR \u2022 M14 EBR -------------------\u2022 FAL\nLMGs------------\u2022M249----------------------------------\u2022 RPK\nShotguns-------\u2022M590-----------------------------------\u2022TOZ\nSniper rifles---\u2022M40A1--------------------------------- \u2022Mosin Nagant\nHandguns------\u2022Makarov \u2022 M45A1 \u2022 M9---------------\u2022 Makarov \u2022 Model 10 \u2022 M1911\nMelee-----------\u2022Knife------------------------------------\u2022 Khukri\n\n\n[b] The Community [/b]\nThe community is pretty casual which is pretty weird for a tactical shooter.\nBut at the end of the round when a team wins/loses everyone starts screaming into their microphone so uh.. watch out lol.", "timestamp_created": 1529922152, "timestamp_updated": 1541788295, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 26, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.743564128875732422", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "8786160": {"recommendationid": "8786160", "author": {"steamid": "76561197980118282", "num_games_owned": 435, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 12671, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1529828287}, "language": "english", "review": "You dash toward the corner, barely escaping a rain of bullets down the hallway, mowing down your teammates in front of you. You take a second to adjust your position, then quickly peek around the corner and unloaded a burst of AK rounds into that barely conceivable shadow of the enemy behind the counter in the dark room.\n\nYou go flank alone, sneak into the next room and see three enemies' back facing you. You swore under your breath that you didn't spend a few points on a suppressor, take a deep breath to stop yourself from panicing out and shooting uncontrollably, then fire a short quick burst into each of their asses before they realize what's happening.\n\nAs you charge toward the bomb site, you literally run into an enemy. Both of you freak out and started blind-fire, your gun start to shake as his bullests thunder by and your vision turns blurry from his muzzle blast, but you get lucky and managed to knock him down before he gets to it first.\n\nYou're sure the sound of that shot came from above that giant rock in front of you. You kneel down, slowly and surely move up the gravel slope, trying to cover every angle in front of you without making any sound. As you climb to the top, you look around carefully and finally see that sniper bellying behind that bush, his giant boots betraying his position. You smirk, switch to your knife and sink the blade deeply into his exposed butt.\n\n=======\n\nThose are all real Insurgency moments I had during the beta. Long time Insurgency player since the original mod, and dare I say that Insurgency is the best infantry combat game out there. It's slightly arcady in the sense that you don't need to learn 25,000 key mappings to do things down to knee-jerking. It's realistic in the sense that your HUD is stripped down to minimal which means, one, you actually have to look hard to tell what you're shooting; two, your view is super clear for you to do so.\n\nInsurgency managed to explain the term \"firefight\" in the purest form. On smaller, Tactical game modes, you'll see players break into small groups or single out, followed by short gunfights breaking out across the map. On larger, Sustained game modes, it's common to see many players grouping up, taking points, pushing and holding for objectives while exchanging franantic automatic fire.\n\nThose adrenalin rushes.
