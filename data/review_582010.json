"last_played": 1551643551}, "language": "english", "review": "First of all I need to say that this game has a shaky review ratio because at launch it had a bunch of connection issues with multiplayer, lack of some PC support and other things, but those have been solved in a couple of weeks. The game has absolute no connection problems and the only time I can remember getting a disconnect from a session in the last 5 months was from the whole Steam going down for 10 minutes.\n\nMonster Hunter, a franchise loved by the Japanese market and once considered to be kind of cult with a small audience in the west is now taking over the world. It's no coincidence they named it Monster Hunter: World because this series has finally fully bloomed to the western market. \n\nAs someone who never played any monster hunter games before (aside from 20 minutes on a 3DS demo that I didn't really enjoy), I must say I fell in love with this game. Played over 120 hours on my friend's PS4 and then moved to PC when it launched and as of now I have 219 hours on PC. My review will be focused towards the people who never played any MH games, since that also was the case with me.\n\n[h1]Story[/h1]\n\nAs the name suggests, in this game you hunt monsters, the whole universe it sets in is about hunting monsters, the very society that exists in the game revolves around monsters. It's a place full of wonders and mystery, where you go out in the wild to face against nature, ultimately to preserve the balance and avoid a disaster. \n\nThe story is nice, not a huge masterpiece or anything, but it is what you expect it to be and is well delivered, it gets you immersed well enough to be entertained. Basically you're part of an expedition to another continent that has been going for decades trying to understand the behavior of a certain important monster, one that can change the whole biome around it. You need to track down that monster, gathering clues about its moves and why it is heading that way, but of course it won't be simply as easy as that.\n\nI can't remember very well now, but when I first played this on the PS4, it took me around 50 hours to finish the whole main story, that's a pretty good amount of time for a main campaign. Aside from the main campaign, you have many optional quests to do and they give you even more quests which give you tools to use, new kinds of food, armor, improved facilities and more. There's a lot of content. \n\n[h1]Gameplay[/h1]\n\nIt's great, it feels awesome. You go alone or with 3 other people on a hunt and you got several different weapons, each of them feels really different from the other, they have their respective strong and weak points and gameplay styles. Hitting monsters with them feels very satisfying, be it from cutting a tail off, to knocking them out for a while after a heavy it on the head, to breaking their claws and other parts, it feels like you are really hurting the monster and your work pays off. \n\nThis game has countless different builds you can make thanks to the skills you get from wearing the hundreds of armor pieces, set bonuses and jewels to tune to your playstyle. There's no real \"meta\" in this game, as often adopting a defensive build is more effective than going full offensive, even if you are good player. You can modify your armor according to your needs and that will change on the monster you are hunting too, as some of them will require you to adapt to their respective threats.\n\nThe grind is real. Get ready to grind, a lot, this game has a lot of RNG involved when it comes to getting monster parts and most importantly jewels but FEAR NOT! Even if you hate grinding like you're used to in other games, like I am, the grind in Monster Hunter: World does not feel like a chore to do, it's fun. I know it may sound like crazy talk, but this is the first game I played that I really didn't mind keep grinding hoping to get what I wanted or jumping into someone's quest to slay a monster just for sport. \n\nPreparing for a hunt and using everything you have at your disposal will prove to be an essential thing for you to master. You may be able to tackle the quests with brute force alone at first, but soon enough you will learn that preparing for a hunt is the best thing you can do to achieve success. Usage of traps, consumables, tools, environment, all of that can help you hunt the monster. Don't be shy to explore your craftable items list, take a good look at what they do and use all that to your advantage because down the road you will need it.\n\nThe game is often updated with new and FREE content. That's right, DLC is completely cosmetic, no need to pay for new monsters, weapons, armor or anything, they give you them for free. There are new events going on every month with things for you to do and collect.  Now that the game has been out for a while, there won't be any new monsters popping up but new versions of them still will be introduced, adding a new challenge and armor. However, there's an expansion coming in autumn 2019, which will need to be payed separately, containing a whole new continent, monsters and the continuation of the story.\n\n[h1]Soundtrack[/h1]\n\nIt is great, the tracks blend in nicely with what is visually presented and really fit the action. Featuring orchestral music, MHW's soundtrack can be easily considered \"epic\". \n\n[h1]Graphics[/h1]\n\nProbably the \"black sheep\" of the this whole game. The game looks good, that's not an issue, however, it was made primarily as a PS4 game to be played at 30 fps and when the PC version was announced everyone was expecting it to run smooth as butter with their machines at 120 fps, but that ended up not really being the case. To be blunt and brief, the game was not very well optimized for the PC, even with a rig that is well above the capacity of a PS4, MHW is a game too demanding for what it offers and that's sadly a negative point about it. [b]However, don't get me wrong, you can still play this with no problems if you meet the minimum specs and go above 60 fps with maximum settings[/b], but it's not what it should've been, they should've done a better job, a job really focused on the PC. To me, that's kind of a common issue with Japanese developers who seem to still not trust the PC market very much, maybe that will change in the next game now that they know there's a good market for their franchise here.\n\n[h1]Verdict[/h1]\n\nMonster Hunter: World is a fantastic game and I very strongly encourage anyone to try it. It is worth every singly cent it costs. I'm very glad I was able to find a new series to be interested in that offers me a very unique and satisfying experience. To me, this was the best game of 2018.", "timestamp_created": 1549514379, "timestamp_updated": 1549577154, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 4, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.536398470401763916", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48872866": {"recommendationid": "48872866", "author": {"steamid": "76561198178883763", "num_games_owned": 9, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 6915, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 53, "last_played": 1551309174}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros\n-I got so hooked that I resigned from my day job just to play all day.\n\n\nCons\n-I'm Unemployed", "timestamp_created": 1549720456, "timestamp_updated": 1549720456, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 5, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.549215376377105713", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48876875": {"recommendationid": "48876875", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070832504", "num_games_owned": 16, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 23809, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2371, "last_played": 1551870991}, "language": "english", "review": "The jewel of the Monster Hunter series.

If u r not a fan of that, don't buy this game. The story is plain and simple and feels like it was made onlz for sake of having in game. I didn't like the characters at all, all are forced. There are some bugs now and then, but my biggest issue was terrible hitbox on many weapons/mosnters. But still one playthrough of it was enjoyable, so if u don't mind grind, give it a try in some sale.\n\nPros: \n-Customization of character is pretty solid and complex\n-Variety of monsters, armors and weapons with ton of movesets.\n-Coop, players in base making it slightly more alive.\n-Interesting biomes/maps with more to do then just killing big monsters\n-small tasks like gardening, research, etc.\n-Great for lovers of grindy games.\nCons:\n-There are some minor bugs or texture glitches (at least I experienced them)\n-HITBOXES ARE BROKEN. Not only those of monsters but yours as well. Many time you will be glad you managed to hit monster even tho it shouldn't but it will also happen vice versa. Monsters many times were not even near touching me but I got hit. It was infuriating. This is not a bug, this is just lazy. It took a lot of fun from many fights for me.\n- PC is getting major events in great delay compared to consoles\n\n\nEven tho there's ton of armors, also in ng+ I dislike a lot of them so I didn't find grinding after finishing story for the first time appealing. (this is rather my opinion only, ur might differ)\n\nIn the end I would give this game 7/10. It's not bad but it's not that amazing as I hoped it to be.

But MH World is awesome! Loved the beautiful graphics, loved the combat movements(I'm very particular about martial arts and motion physics), loved the environments, loved the \"un-partitioned\" areas, loved the vast decoration customization, and many more. It's basically kinda like my dream game. I've been looking for games that I would really enjoy cuz' a lot of games (In this comment time) are mostly battle royale. I've played Fortnite, and after a while, it gets very repetitive and since every game starts with zero, I can't bring something that I can customize, so I felt that there is no progress(improving your character and whatnot). Then I found this, MHW, and fell in love with it. I'm glad I joined not long before the Anniversary Event, where all previous event quest become available.\n\nWith all that said, there are some negatives:\n- The Monster Moster is Small. There are the easy ones(G.Jagras, Kulu, Diablos, Rath, etc) and there are some elders (Kusha, Vaal, Teo, Luna, Kirin, Zorah, Nergi, and Baby Xeno(literally just born)), and there's a raid for 16 people in 4 teams (Kulve Taroth). This will easily get repetitive for those who don't enjoy taking down the same monsters over and over again. And there's Behemoth :3 (a collaboration monster)\n\n- The Weapons, ignore this if you don't want to spoil yourself cuz it made me sad when I realised this. The weapons are the same, the exact same sword patched with some monster skin, and call it a new sword. Unlike other MH games, every weapon is unique and there were ridiculous weapons like a pizza sword. I'm kind of a sword enthusiast, so this saddens me.\n\n- Shared Carts, maybe this works for other MH as well, but it makes multiplayer stressful if you hunt for something like Behemoth, noobs will die and 3 times - you're out!, I wish they changed this so that if the carts ran out, the survivors can carry on and only the last carted will return to base. That way it won't affect the remaining proes who will probably finish the quest no problem. Because of this, a lot of proes prefer going solo.\n\n- It's Kinda too Easy, once you get used to it or discovered the power of Cluster Bombs, it becomes really easy(for the not mentally challenged, I understand). I usually farm while watching Youtube anyway. So I do wish for more monsters like Behemoth, trying to beat that guy out for the first time was heck a lot of fun (I'm the kind of person who doesn't give up until I'm satisfied). But other than that, the Arch Tempereds are just....ok. Kinda feels like they normal ones should be that powerful from the start.\n\nOn the end note:\nDespite the flaws, a lot of new contents are coming very slowly for free(I kinda feel wrong, cuz they need money to survive), like the Witcher 3 collab(already available on console), the Iceborne expansion with new icy place and monsters to add to the roster plus the Master Rank(basically G Rank, which a lot of pro players are craving for) and probably more collabs that Capcom are working on for MHW. And because of the success of MHW, they might add another expansion(the world map has plenty of room left :D) the year after Iceborne.", "timestamp_created": 1550667548, "timestamp_updated":

Understanding each monster is vital to the hunt. Knowing their moves, and predicting moments they will open up for a moment for a free hit. Timing is everything in this game, from dodging to striking. Practicing against monsters is key, and walking in expecting victory without experience against monsters is a bad idea. Every monster can punish a mistimed strike. \n\nIn terms of weapons, the safer a weapon is to use, the less damage it typically does. The same applies to faster weapons. The faster a weapon, the less damage it deals. That's not to say speedy weapons are worthless, as taking advantage of this speed allows for faster weapons to hit when slower weapons may not. And the raw damage of the slower weapons means every hit counts.\n\nIn terms of armor, there is a wide variety of skills and abilities that permeate the game, allowing for broad variations of bonuses to fighting styles. Not to mention the armors themselves are very beautiful, I'm looking at you Gala Suit.\n\nOverall, this is a game that thrills through learning and patience.

Slaying monsters in this game offers a satisfaction unlike any other game. I\u2019ve heard it described as an \u201ceasier Dark Souls\u201d, and I tend to agree with that. It is certainly challenging, but not frustratingly so. I only occasionally died to any given monster more than once. You fight monsters, slay them, and build better armor from their body parts. Rinse and repeat! I\u2019ll tell you right now: I RECOMMEND IT!\n\n--- {Story} ---\nThe story in MHW is nothing to write home about, but I was actually surprised at the effort they put into it. It is lighthearted, whimsical, funny, and sometimes a tad awkward. But if you are playing MHW, you aren't playing it for the story. You can expect about 10% of the dialogue to be voiced, the remainder is conveyed via text boxes, your character doesn\u2019t speak (although the game has one of the best character creation tools I\u2019ve used).\n--- {Gameplay} ---\nThe gameplay is simple on the surface, but complex as you learn more about each playstyle and weapon, monster abilities. Each weapon has a relatively limited number of combos compared to many other fighting games, but with 14 different weapon classes, there is plenty of options for a variety of playstyles, both melee and ranged. The hunts are meaningful, and engaging. There are a wide variety of monsters to hunt, each with their own unique move set. Definitely best played with a controller.\n--- {Graphics} ---\nOutstanding. The game looks beautiful and performance wise it runs like butter. There is a wonderful polish on this game that continually had me impressed. If you are running into performance issues, try reducing or disabling volumetric fog.\n--- {Audio} ---\nThe music is engaging and weapon/monster sounds are well done. No complaints here\n--- {Replay Value/Grind} ---\nHIGH, if you plan to grind to get best gear and weapons after the story. The grind is much more fun with friends after you beat the main story, although I played the entire story solo. Plus, with the Witcher crossover event and dlc coming Autumn 2019, there will be plenty of fresh content coming this year.\n--- {Game Time} ---\nI would estimate that it is about 10-15 hours into the game before you\u2019ve seen MOST of the tutorials introducing you to the various game systems. The main story took me 70 hours to beat, that was with doing all the \u201coptional\u201d quests one time. \n--- {Value} ---\nDefinitely worth $60 full price. You get plenty of hours out of it with just the story. It\u2019s a steal if you get it on sale for anything less than $60.\n--- {Bugs} ---\nNone that I noticed or were significant enough to remember. Sometimes my damn palico (cat helper) would just sit there and watch as I died instead of bringing me a health potion, but not sure if that is an AI issue or I wasn't getting some sort of hidden roll.\n--- {Final Verdict} ---\n9/10, would have cats make my meals any day.\n", "timestamp_created": 1549787682, "timestamp_updated": 1549787682, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.5071868896484375", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48962009": {"recommendationid": "48962009", "author": {"steamid": "76561198098343350", "num_games_owned": 17, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 3608, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 834, "last_played": 1551632740}, "language": "english", "review": "this game is fun, i do recommend it.

It adds to the feeling that you're weak and unprepared to fight them. Hell, the first time I saw a Rathian, it simply left me alone, because I wasn't worth its time. I stalked it silently, until it noticed I wasn't going away, and then began acting aggressive. \nThe maps in this game are no longer connected with loading zones, meaning everything is a huge map to play around in. No longer is the fight disrupted by being knocked out of a zone, or easy escape from a monster possible. You can see monsters moving around in real-time on your map, even when you're not in their zone.\nThe controls are the perfect balance between easy to learn, but hard to master. Anyone can pick up any weapon and have a good time, but the combos that experienced players can pull off are some of the strongest attacks in the game. You can really feel the weight of your weapon as you swing it around. The slow, methodical fighting makes every attack a strategic play.\n\nIf you have the 60$, I highly recommend getting this game for yourself.

A lot of negative reviews were added to this game's store page during it's rocky PC launch. CAPCOM's servers were garbage at launch and had a lot of stability problems, the game was also poorly optimized and there were some hardware compatibility issues that many people were experiencing. This has all been fixed, as far as I know. I've had no problems running this game at max settings at 144 fps and have never been disconnected unexpectedly even once.  \n\n     This is the most fun I've had with a game in years. I've been addicted to this garbage game called Overwatch since 2016, playing a few other titles here and there before I would drop them and go back to it, and this game broke that spell. The world is so vast and fun to explore and it rewards you for doing so. The gear progression is unlike any I've ever seen in a game, specifically the visual progression. Gear comes with all sorts of different traits and leaves you with infinite build possibilities. The pool of weapons to choose from is vast, but the game encourages you to try all of them at your leisure by refunding weapon tree upgrades and never penalizing you for making the switch if you decide to spice things up.  \n\n     What's even more fascinating is even after delving into discussion threads on reddit and MHW-related forums, I can't find a single consensus on what the \"best\" weapon in the game is. It seems to me like the developers did a perfect job balancing all the weapons so that no single one is better than the other, which baffles me considering there's over a dozen of them. Currently, I'm using the Great Sword and I'm loving it but I've got my eyes on the Charge Blade and Dual Blades to try out in the near future.  \n\n     The game offers a consistent challenge from the get go. Each monster offers an immensely different fighting experience that always keeps you on your feet. Being mindful of the fact that all monsters are different is a key component to being successful in the game. Observing each monster's attack patterns, movement, and possible weak spots and developing a fighting strategy on the fly is a truly unique combat experience that few other games can offer. On top of this you'll have to manage things like attack and defense buffs, weapon sharpness, your stamina pool, and obviously health during the fight.  \n  \n    I could go into way more detail but I think other reviews have probably said it better than I have and if you're interested in what the core loop of the game looks like I'd recommend looking up some YouTube videos to see if it's your cup of tea. All in all, I highly recommend this game. It has endless replayability, it has no microtransactions and is consistently updated with new events and content, and it is an extremely rewarding and fantastically made game. \n  \n", "timestamp_created": 1550732699, "timestamp_updated": 1550732699, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49199261": {"recommendationid": "49199261", "author": {"steamid": "76561198293930738", "num_games_owned": 5, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 6314, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 995, "last_played": 1551851747}, "language": "english", "review": "very good game <3", "timestamp_created": 1550968759, "timestamp_updated": 1550968759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49199454": {"recommendationid": "49199454", "author": {"steamid": "76561198049744964", "num_games_owned": 671, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 11379, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 3041, "last_played": 1551832401}, "language": "english", "review": "First off, don't be intimidated by the online component.

There's plenty of weapons all different from each other, from the technical Charge Blade, to the slow and powerful (and based) GreatSword, to long ranged weapons, etc. Visuals are stunning, and the world feels really alive. You'll even witness monsters having turf wars and interacting with each other which is pretty goddamn cool. Combat-wise it's quite difficult and if you don't have much experience with the likes of Dark Souls (which is similar to this game) you'll PROBABLY get your butt kicked a lot in the beginning.\nDefinitely recommended.\n\n\n\nanyway black diablos = cancer", "timestamp_created": 1551312555, "timestamp_updated": 1551356150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.513677835464477539", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49319617": {"recommendationid": "49319617", "author": {"steamid": "76561198064974000", "num_games_owned": 42, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 19867, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 7310, "last_played": 1551876965}, "language": "english", "review": "This game has a great depth, good content, action packed and I recommend it to others", "timestamp_created": 1551548345, "timestamp_updated": 1551548345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49313838": {"recommendationid": "49313838", "author": {"steamid": "76561198044515452", "num_games_owned": 57, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 32470, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 518, "last_played": 1551763399}, "language": "english", "review": "Pros: \n-Great game to start with if you're new and interested in the franchise\n\n-Great soundtrack, each monster battle feels different and unique from each other from the battle theme alone\n\n-Vast open and seamless maps unlike older MH games where entering another zone pops up the loading screen\n\n-Don't like the way your armor looks? There's Layered Armor which is basically the game's transmog and god do they look great. My personal favourite being the Gala Suit and the Skull Mask\n\n-The collaboration events which add even more to the end-game experience, from bringing back Deviljho, to Devil May Cry Dante's layered armor, and fighting the Behemoth from Final Fantasy IV. Best part of all, they are all FREE!\n\n-MODS! If you're ever bored or burnt out from playing the game, go browse some mods to enhance your MHW experience. There are lots of amazing quality-of-life and cosmetic mods which will surely add a few more hours to your total playtime\n\nCons:\n-Lacking in number of large monsters compared to older MH games (also lacking in \"cool-looking\" monsters when compared to older MH titles, I'm looking at you Jyuratodus)\n\n-Also besides the lack of cool-looking monsters, there is also a lack of cool-looking weapons when compared to older titles. Capcom's reason being they want the weapons in World to look \"realistic\" but in the end, most of what we get are dull looking weapons which do not give the impression of \"Hey, I just crafted this end-game weapon after trying to defeat this monster over a hundred times\" and it looks more like polished scrap\n\n-No 'real' tutorial when it comes to helping players learn the game, eg; Breaking certain monster parts, how to capture a monster, benefits of slaying vs capturing a monster, completing bounties, using your environment, I can go on and on. TL;DR, there is so much depth in MHW which I feel is essential for every hunter to learn when playing the game and the game doesn't do quite a good job and teaching players what they should know\n\n-Besides the obvious name being \"Monster Hunter\", there really isn't a whole lot to do once you're done hunting the monsters you need to craft the gear you want. The only ways I can think of if you're looking to fight back monsters you've already fought before just for the sake of fun are either do speedruns or just fight naked\n\n-PC players get updates much more behind schedule compared to console players who already done such content months before PC players. So if you have already seen such events already on console, have patience for such content to come to PC. It may be later than consoles but it doesn't mean we won't be getting them. On the bright side, MODS!\n\nVerdict: 8/10. It is my personal Game of The Year for 2018 and I would still add hundreds of hours more into this game. I look forward to seeing how Iceborne will shape up MHW.

I've played roughly over 110h so far. I was worried a lot since the game got a lot of negative reviews in the beginning. I can't support this view at all. Let's go to the procon-list overview:\n\n+ Immersive world (maps, setting and even the story)\n+ story (for a MH game this is quite impressive compared to MH Generations on the 3DS)\n+ weapons and armor  (i liked the crafting tree concept a lot since u have to get back to smaller monsters later in the game to craft high class weapon you haven't thought about a long the first progression)\n+ group gameplay (hot join option is a big advantage for the MH series!)\n+ controls (I've treated myself with a usb controller which works perfectly fine, can*t judge about mouse+keyboard tho)\n\n++ Bosses (nothing ever seen close to the awesomeness of the bosses, anyway i missed the astalos a lil bit but maybe it comes in the upcoming addon)\n++ comfort options (boss encyclopedia, the plant and bug growing guy, the melting lady i dont want to miss this anymore!)\n\n0 music (my gf says the soundtack from mhgen was more catchy)\n\n- Actually nothing comes to my mind related to this kind of game. You get what you pay for. Not more nor less.\n\nSo far im very pleased with the experienced i gained in MHW. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes challenging boss fights and a lil bit of grinding. Don't play this if you get frustrated easily. But still for low skills players this game can be learned and completed quite easy.\n\nThanks for reading my review.

(Not a lot of option but decent)\n- [b] SKILL>SKIN [/b] (if youre using a full set of armor, then theres something wrong with you :/) (well unless its Drachen..)\n- Dev keeps on giving Content! (Lots of awesome contents especially End game like the Arch Tempered Elder Dragons \n   quest, Collaborations, Events and plenty more) (Also ICEBORNE)\n- Collaboration events are amazing (Ever want to hunt the Behemoth from Final Fantasy IX as Dante DMC?)\n- High Replayabilty (depends on you tho)\n- A somewhat Active community\n- Lots of Builds for each weapons (Theres no Best Weapon or Best armor everything is situational and depends on the monster which i love) (ofcourse theres the META build)\n\n[b] Cons [/b] \n- Story [spoiler] Wait theres a story? [/spoiler]\n- Just keep grinding, keep grinding, keep grinding, keep grinding (honestly not surprising but this game RNG is soo shit [spoiler] Attack Jewel what is that?? [/spoiler])\n- RNG MORE LIKE\n  R No\n  N [spoiler] Insert the material you really need here [/spoiler]\n  G For you bitch\n- Connection error, CONNECTION ERROR, [b] CONNECTION ERROR [/b] Capcom please, the last thing i want is to solo a Behemoth with 1 Cart left, and then CONNECTION ERROR)\n- Cheating and modding is allowed apparently (now i know what are you thinking. why is it on Cons, well its more of a personal thing but i hate cheating. Its fine if your on your own but don't ruin other people experience for your Ego. Also don't flex when youre cheating)\n- You kinda get burnt out after a while \n- Repetitive (if you are the kind of person who doesn't like to grind things then be prepared)\n\nAlright thats all for now i'm gonna score the game when i get the Attack jewel sooooo i'll be gone for a while.........", "timestamp_created": 1549615176, "timestamp_updated": 1549615358, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.505962550640106201", "comment_count": 1, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49279849": {"recommendationid": "49279849", "author": {"steamid": "76561198445992476", "num_games_owned": 14, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 1052, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 60, "last_played": 1550780707}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1551366345, "timestamp_updated": 1551366345, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.537313401699066162", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49270805": {"recommendationid": "49270805", "author": {"steamid": "76561198273123314", "num_games_owned": 34, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 10982, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1955, "last_played": 1551790960}, "language": "english", "review": "Dont play this game if you cant manage your time", "timestamp_created": 1551316031, "timestamp_updated": 1551316031, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.532619237899780273", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49121070": {"recommendationid": "49121070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198202269716", "num_games_owned": 37, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 4387, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 62, "last_played": 1550825925}, "language": "english", "review": "I want to like this game. It looks pretty, it plays pretty, I make pretty things out of dead things. But there's something missing that doesn't quite speak \"Monster Hunter\" to me.\n\nThere's an abundant of monsters missing for starters, even Tri for the Wii had a better selection, the monsters do make up in being crafty but lack in numbers. This is one of those times that quality did not beat quantity, because the monsters in other instalments were unique in their own right that it didn't feel like the same 5 monsters, it felt like 25. Even the azure, gold, crimson, silver, and all the other varients which looked like reskins (and basically were) had stats changed that made them feel different, where it changed from being weak to water to actually being weak to electricity and additionally had more health and did more damage to the player. \n\nAs a result it feels weapons also suffered, with the lack of variety, just go big, don't put no thought into a build, I maxed maybe 3 weapons with Fire, Water, Electricity, because that's all you need to win. There's very few monsters that render a weapon difficult, like hammers? You can only buy hammers and be fine, rarely have to worry about knockback if you max it and get blue or white sharpness on it. Agnaktor called, and it's laughing at how a Uragaan doesn't deflect like it use to. Anyone remember the fatalis, or silver rathalos, or nakarkos that would legit deflect 95% of attacks unless you had white/purple sharpness? The step up weapons have is compared to generations, my god, I'm so happy a great sword can do 1k base damage and a sword and shield does 300, and not both doing 250 damage at maxed level like generations had them do.\n\nMultiplayer while in the hub is a bit odd at first since you join people, but it still follows the traditional \"everyone ready up and the host will start the quest\", I know there's a small guild area but I think it would have been sexy if other people joined in one city instead. Similar to how you joined a guild hall or in Tri an actual city where you interact with other players. Again i know, small guild area, but meeting people in town would have been more appealing to the \"grouping\" narrative.\n\nI do think SOS was a smart move, so was carrying over mounting, grappling hooks, being able to change equipment (even though I never use it) and even fast travel. I do miss old tracking styles but this new one is fresh. You'll probably learn to track the monster without it since you have to fight it over and over again not because you want it's parts (maybe you do) but because it's such a small roster of large monsters. The way potions are used, excellent, part of it use to be a perceptive skill where you had to plan to stay still, now you get a bit of a walk while chugging,\n\nI miss alot of the old stuff but if you never touched a monster hunter, this is a good place to start, it's easier and dumbed down, I want them to add monsters, to add areas if possible, not just events or rare sighting, but more armors and weapons, make this game explode. I put in so little time into the game and I feel done because there's no G rank, there's little merit to maxing this game where other games I put over 750 hours easily for every monster scenario. I recommend the game to new and old players, but I know it can be better not just pretty.", "timestamp_created": 1550673584, "timestamp_updated": 1550673584, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.487398654222488403", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48818558": {"recommendationid": "48818558", "author": {"steamid": "76561198070770268", "num_games_owned": 222, "num_reviews": 24, "playtime_forever": 5894, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 832, "last_played": 1551488937}, "language": "english", "review": "Great Jagras jiggles when he eats a Aptonoth", "timestamp_created": 1549531670, "timestamp_updated": 1549531670, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.523809552192687988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48800536": {"recommendationid": "48800536", "author": {"steamid": "76561198066192361", "num_games_owned": 63, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 14096, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 47, "last_played": 1550778126}, "language": "english", "review": "Monster Hunter World is a bit easy game compare to console game line such as MHGENX and its previous versions.\nThere's only 2 outcome while playing this game.

This game is what It feels like; every hunt is thrilling and will keep you on the edge, no matter if you hunt solo or with groups.  It seems very difficult at first; however, if you're careful and understand the moveset of each monster you'll be able to deal staggering blows that feel extremely rewarding. Hunting a monster without taking any damage and getting in the flow of the hunt is pure catharsis.\nThere is a great variety of weapons, and they all seem to come straight out of an anime, so don't expect much realism if that's your thing; melee weapons like greatswords that take seconds to deal a single hit from dual blades that devour your stamina to ranged weapons like bows that shoot arrows the size of your character and bowguns that can shoot like a minigun, there is always a weapon to fit your style, and they're all equally viable from early to late game so it's all down to a matter of preference, though some are more complex than others.\nThe game is split in two parts: Low Rank (LR) and High Rank (HR). LR is where you spend most of the main story missions; monsters deal less damage and have less hp but your equipment is also weaker. HR is where true Monster Hunter begins; monsters have more hp and damage but this is where you start crafting your endgame gear.\n\nGraphics\nPretty good, but it's heavy on the hardware and requires a better gaming PC to run it properly.\n\nSound\nNo music while exploring the maps, it starts when the monster is attacking you; also becomes a cue to when the monster is about to sleep when it stops playing. Some monsters have unique tracks. Weapon sound effects are very satisfying, and it really feels powerful when you deal a critical blow.\n\nPlot\nBarely enough to justify your hunts, don't get into this game if you expect to feel something other than satisfaction while slaying monsters.\n\nConclusion\nGame is fantastic, one of the best I have ever played. No microtransactions or lootbox BS except for a few cosmetic items (and even then, there are plenty you can get by just playing). Port is ok, had a few problems on release but they all seem fixed now.\nMH:W is the first game of the series that I have ever played, since every release so far was on a console that I didn't own.

I had a lot of fun following the main story, then even up to Hunter Level 100, but beyond that the experience purely suffocating.\n\nTo clarify, I'm a souls' series veteran. I love a challenge.

It has been an excellent experience and I can't wait to play more in the series if it comes to PC. \n\nA plethora of combat options and a world that truly feels alive. Every monster is a joy to learn its weaknesses and take to school with your weapon of choice. The beasts all feel like they really occupy space and have weight behind all of their attacks. Everything is difficult without being cheesy. I am told this game has the least options and is the most watered down of the Monster Hunter games but for a new player, you would never know it. \n\nIf you ever wanted to play something like Dark Souls but against giant monsters and nothing else, this is your game. \n\nAs a mostly PC player, I played the whole game with a mouse/keyboard without any issues at all. The controls felt responsive and fluid and I never felt hindered by my control choice. The menu options aren't ideal for mouse/keyboard but you get used to them fast enough. \n\nMy only gripe is that I wish there was a way to turn any armor into a 'layered' armor set as by the end of the game, most armors are rendered obsolete which limits the ability to play a version of fashion souls as you might do with Dark souls. \n\nChange the town music.\n\nKill the handler.", "timestamp_created": 1551773935, "timestamp_updated": 1551773935, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.483081340789794922", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49231633": {"recommendationid": "49231633", "author": {"steamid": "76561198076490925", "num_games_owned": 69, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 4236, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 270, "last_played": 1550767870}, "language": "english", "review": "I honestly love this game albeit its community can be a bit toxic with the MLG crap.", "timestamp_created": 1551108634, "timestamp_updated": 1551108634, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.47413790225982666", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48894226": {"recommendationid": "48894226", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027972773", "num_games_owned": 128, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 17119, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2686, "last_played": 1551847516}, "language": "english", "review": "Yes", "timestamp_created": 1549786327, "timestamp_updated": 1549786327, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.475609779357910156", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49061932": {"recommendationid": "49061932", "author": {"steamid": "76561198399816159", "num_games_owned": 51, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 20615, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 370, "last_played": 1550879347}, "language": "english", "review": "good game", "timestamp_created": 1550440953, "timestamp_updated": 1550440953, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": 0, "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49059630": {"recommendationid": "49059630", "author": {"steamid": "76561198179586791", "num_games_owned": 50, "num_reviews": 4, "playtime_forever": 260, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1547927702}, "language": "english", "review": "steam why", "timestamp_created": 1550432182, "timestamp_updated": 1550432182, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 0, "weighted_vote_score": "0.517945349216461182", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49061872": {"recommendationid": "49061872", "author": {"steamid": "76561198075799843", "num_games_owned": 72, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 6322, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549145599}, "language": "english", "review": "Amazing game, great port, ecen got update for 21:9 ultrawide aspect ratio.

It\u2019s not a terrible game by any means, but I would wait until it goes on sale. Also maybe have a pal or two to play it with for the sake of your sanity.\n \nThis game helps newcomers to the franchise by explaining old and new mechanics through a ridiculous amount of tutorials that you can\u2019t skip and will be showing themselves again at random even when you\u2019re hundreds of hours into your playtime. Also, make sure you have your character the way you want them to be (or make damn good use of that free edit voucher you get), because a lot of the customization aspects aren\u2019t changeable once you complete the character. And you can\u2019t even change your character\u2019s name with the voucher; you have to use third party programs to do so. I will say though it definitely has a lot more quality of life improvements than the other games. The scoutflies will guide you to a track or even the monster itself (when they decide to work), you can leave food at the canteen to cook while you\u2019re away, you can grow most of the stuff you would ever need for crafting with the ancient tree (and meld the rest that you can\u2019t grow), and there\u2019s even a nice training room that lists your combos that you can use to practice smacking barrels with your weapons. I just wish that the scoutflies didn't force your camera controls away from you and direct it in some arbitrary direction that isn't even towards the monster half of the time. \n \nI\u2019ve seen people complain about the game having a rampant cheater problem which I haven\u2019t come across too often. My only experiences with this were seeing arena clear times that were clearly impossible to accomplish and seeing somebody fighting an arch-tempered Teostra with a hunter rank of 999 (which could very well still be legitimate, it\u2019s just the only HR999 I\u2019ve seen on this game so far).\n \nMy biggest problem with this game is the lack of longevity. You can circumvent this to some extent by switching up your weapon in order to add more variety, or even go on a collectathon and make all of the gear and weapons you could possibly want. There\u2019s even the endemic life that you can collect that will unlock a nice guild card background that you can use once you catch all of the animals. However in terms of actual hunting content this game is rather weak compared to the other MH games I\u2019ve played. I almost exclusively play gunlance (with some hunting horn mixed in) and have never had an issue with getting bored with it or finding things to do in other games because of G-rank or playing with friends. But it just feels like there isn\u2019t a lot to do at endgame. Or, at least, the endgame ENDS way too quickly for me. The Appreciation Fest that was going on was a good way of playing more content because they added most of the old event quests in, but with that gone now there isn\u2019t much to do than farm the rotating event quests as much as humanly possible.\n\nA quick side note since I mentioned G-rank... Why didn't the game just ship with it? The fact that they're putting it out as paid DLC later on and renaming it to \"master rank\" (ugh) kinda gives me a bad vibe about what they plan to do with it... Anyways, moving on.\n \nAs of right now the only thing I\u2019m doing is farming for miniature and giant crown monsters to fill out the last two achievements on my guild card, but past that I don\u2019t know what else I\u2019d do. There is always Kulve Taroth once she comes back in the next event because her weapon drops are complete RNG (though I was fortunate enough to get one of her rarity 8 gunlances before she left) so there\u2019s potentially hundreds more hours there because her drop pool is so huge.\n\nSpeaking of RNG, the drop rates in this game have definitely increased quite a bit. This is to the joy of many new and veteran MH players, and the despair of others. While farming for a monster gem for potentially dozens, if not hundreds, of hours may not sound like a grand time, it was definitely a bulk of my hours before. Now if I need a gem from Nergigante or Deviljho I can easily get it within an hour. Hooray. I was able to make my armor and weapons quicker\u2026 now what?\n \nHunting with friends is another big source of entertainment. Not only can you help each other get what you need from a monster or to finish hunts you haven\u2019t completed yet, but there tends to be a lot of wacky stuff that happens when there\u2019s more than one hunter involved. It\u2019s always a good feeling when your friend accidentally (or intentionally) upswings you at just the right time and you mount the monster with a mid-air attack. But with multiplayer comes lots of frustration (who would\u2019ve thought?) I tend to stick with my group of friends that are actually good at the game, but I\u2019ve had more times than I care to admit where I will either answer an SOS flare (or fire one myself) and have somebody join and immediately triple-cart because they came in not knowing what they were doing. I guess that\u2019s nothing new, but it\u2019s worth mentioning. Also, the multiplayer monster scaling can be annoying. Once another player joins the monster\u2019s health scales 2.6x. That may not be horrible unless you\u2019re fighting an arch-tempered monster. At that point it becomes a giant pain and it becomes much more viable to hunt these solo. It\u2019s easier to fight the hardest monsters in the game alone... that statement hurts a bit.\n\nLastly, I can\u2019t comment on the mouse and keyboard controls because I play with a controller, but I\u2019ve been told that they\u2019re absolutely godawful. 10/10 best port.\n \nI don\u2019t hate this game (though I\u2019m sure my review says otherwise), but there are a few changes here and there that couldn\u2019t hurt. Maybe things will get a bit better once the DLC comes, or even before then if we\u2019re lucky. At least there\u2019ll be more to do.", "timestamp_created": 1550905392, "timestamp_updated": 1550920657, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 3, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.46594005823135376", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49048109": {"recommendationid": "49048109", "author": {"steamid": "76561198085863388", "num_games_owned": 167, "num_reviews": 16, "playtime_forever": 7182, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 1296, "last_played": 1551855514}, "language": "english", "review": "This game is pretty amazing, and it's great fun with some friends, but it has some problems that make me hate it.

The sheer amount of enjoyment this game provides is spectacular with a unique combat system and game mechanics unique to the Monster Hunter genre.

Just play it like you did the other Monster Hunter's and keep it offline till they get their ducks in a row unless you have friends on a LAN (and even then there will be disconnects).\n\nI am constantly getting disconnected and having to fend off a game that balances when people join, but does not revert back once they disconnect so you're left fighting a monster for 3x the time in a fight you already put 10 minutes into. Any time you forget about disconnecting issues and the team you random dropped in with is coordinating and dominating the monster. All of a sudden you will be grabbed and violently shook back to reality as the monster and the host stand still for 50 seconds and you are left in an empty game with a 4 person monster to kill. Fix the netcode.

Doing anything, going anywhere, involves instancing. Venturing into its \"open world\" requires \"registering\" with your hunter's partner. You have to *ask* the game for a special \"open world\" session, called an \"expedition\". It reminds me of stories I used to hear about cosplaying in Japan. I don't know if it's true or not, but I've been told that cosplay in Japan is \"reserved\" for certain areas, locked away in assigned rooms or gyms; cosplayers don't have the open-world freedom they have here in the US or Canada. That's very much what Monster Hunter: World feels like. It feels like the designers had a burning need to loom over your shoulder and control every second of your gameplay experience. Someone clearly had anxieties about giving the player too much freedom in the world, like an alcoholic soccer mom with OCD whose daughter just turned sixteen and got a car.

In the end though, two words describe every single aspect of the game: half-done.\nThe storyline is mediocre at best, and short. It comes so close to being amazing, then gives up halfway through.\nThe combat tries really hard to be incredible, but the controls aren't as fluid as the devs probably think they are. What's more fun, monsters will sit there and scream over and over again, so you just sit and go nowhere, and before you can move they hit you, then they hit you again, and in a solid 8-10 seconds of not being able to act, you die. \nNow, many people will disagree and say \"bruh just don't get hit lol\" and they are correct. that's why they branded it \"souls-like.\" But, its extreme crap that monsters can miss you by five feet and still take you out. Vaulting over a monster that's charging at you doesn't exist in this game, even if you clear it by a mile.\nLong story short, the weapons are fun, the game is fun, and i enjoyed it. However, there is almost zero content, what content there is is wildly, hilariously repetitive, and for a skill-based game, it's very focused on having the right gear, traps and consumeables. Even if you have all those things, monsters will sometimes attacks in ABSURDELY rapid succession, and you just flat-out die. And in some cases, you literally cannot dodge because the game just makes them move faster.\nLooking at you Black Diablos...\n\nMaybe try it on a really cheap sale. But it is only 15-25% complete, and most of you deaths will come from situations where there was no amount of skill that could have saved you.\n\nEDIT: I've gone back a few times to try and find replay value, and instead found another problem. Barring the fact that they aren't really releasing anything new, the only way to advance beyond the ending or beat the highest content is with friends, or by playing 300 hours and getting ridiculously good. The resulting issue i'm facing is that the multiplayer community is TOXIC AS HELL.

Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate for the Switch has over 100 monsters, constantly introducing new ones, a wealth of different play styles, and best of all, is portable. World is such an an arrogant game that doesn't even have 40 monsters, doesn't have hunter styles/arts, 5 maps, most of which are claustrophobic to no end (looking at you, Ancient Forest), and have verticality ranging all over the place to the point where I'm not sure if I'm in a forest, or in a bouncy castle with foliage. The main story is HOT GARBAGE too. MH isn't known for its story, so I'm not too mad with it being shallower than a puddle, but the gameplay you have to do to advance it is TERRIBAD. Killing monsters is usually fine in other games, but with World's trademark \"These maps are more cumbersome to travel through than a peanut butter + concrete marathon\" style of level design, the whole combat system suffers. And not one, not two, not three, not four, but 5 TIMES do you have to do the most arbitrary thing I've ever done in a video game. Manually track down monsters, with footprints and claw marks. I know most people got through this just fine. I am not one of those lucky individuals. The first tracking mission to find a Pink Rathian took me 10 hours. I hear some people saying already; \"10 hours?!?! Wow, you suck at this game. You're worse at hunting than fucking Nemo.\". And to those of you who say that, I disagree. With over a collective 1200+ hours into this series, I think I am more than capable of fighting dragons and killing monsters, and the tracking missions aren't even about hunting monsters in a game called Monster Hunter. As I said before, they're about finding tracks of a monster, and they spawn based on luck. I'm pretty sure I didn't buy \"Medieval forensics simulator 2019\", either. They realized later on that these missions are dreadful, and make it way easier for the later 4 times you do it. These shouldn't exist. EVER. Anyway, how's the presentation? Visually, it's stunning. The PC port is very poorly optimized for a majority of systems, so I have to put the graphics on low so that I'm not watching MS Powerpoint. Aside from some noticeable pixelation, it looks alright. I wish I could have it look better though. Other games I can easily run on Ultra High graphics, but the PC port of World leaves a lot to be desired. The music is below average. You have ambient nature for most of the game, but when it's time to throw down, you get bland and forgettable orchestra. While writing this, I'm really trying to think of any tracks aside from the first few notes on the title screen and the Astera, the main hub, but I'm struggling. Gameplay is really odd to peg, considering the fact that the level design almost always has you in a corner, and monsters stun-locking you is a very real circumstance, and sometimes you can be at full health and get combo'd, stunned, and die. I know that's sometimes the risk you take in monster hunter, but that shouldn't be an excuse. Some monsters can literally jump across an entire area, which for some, makes no goddamn sense, but either way, reasonable or not, it gets very frustrating fighting to a jumping pickle or a porcupine doing its best rabbit imitation. It needs some refining, but I can easily get that with a much more satisfyingly spent 60 dollars on the switch version, than a purchase that leaves me feeling like I could have bought something else instead and enjoyed it more. And with Iceborne announced, I now have another reason to detest Capcom. This game is not worth it.\n\nTL;DR Main story sucks. Switch Monster Hunter has way more content. Graphics are pretty good. Music needs work. Gameplay has some glaring flaws that hamper the overall experience.\n\nIn the end, what I'm trying to say is\n\nCELESTE GAME OF THE YEAR 2018 \n\nSEE YA NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERDS", "timestamp_created": 1550107293, "timestamp_updated": 1550107293, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.402930408716201782", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48808756": {"recommendationid": "48808756", "author": {"steamid": "76561198891396374", "num_games_owned": 3, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 981, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 715, "last_played": 1550898651}, "language": "english", "review": "Boring game always do the same thing.", "timestamp_created": 1549488820, "timestamp_updated": 1549488820, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 2, "votes_funny": 1, "weighted_vote_score": "0.345513969659805298", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "49312766": {"recommendationid": "49312766", "author": {"steamid": "76561198342956822", "num_games_owned": 56, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 41, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549455857}, "language": "english", "review": "Most annoying cut-scenes all time in early game.\nBoring gameplay.\nAnnoying characters.\nTotal awful character customization/ design (Even free MMO have better character development)\n \n", "timestamp_created": 1551524712, "timestamp_updated": 1551524712, "voted_up": false, "votes_up": 1, "votes_funny": 3, "weighted_vote_score": "0.360530436038970947", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48955462": {"recommendationid": "48955462", "author": {"steamid": "76561198150301816", "num_games_owned": 66, "num_reviews": 11, "playtime_forever": 250, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550000431}, "language": "english", "review": "Dat was the Worst gameplay game i have ever played, and no text voices, they just laughing and say one-two words.

Try a new weapon. I can't stress this enough! Don't just stick with one weapon, try to learn them all. You'll definitely find something that fits you best, but knowing another weapon makes you want to do hunts again and again. You will get a lot more hours doing this.\n\n2. Play with friends, or with randoms. While in most games, playing with randoms can hinder your gaming experience, but that's with all multiplayer games. There are bad apples, but in a coop game, they're not nearly as problematic. When playing with people, you can and will have moments that will highten your experience. Like in Level 6 Kulve Taroth, jumping down and breaking her gold coating on the horns with just one hit while your teammates drop rocks on her tail, while also ruining her precious golden mantle. You can seriously get a good sense of comradery when playing with people. As for friends, do the same thing, but also take on hunts that challenge you. If you find a monster annoying, keep fighting him. Learn his quirks. This game is as much a learning game as it is a fun game. Learn weapons, learn monsters. \n\n3. Go on an expedition and just watch the monsters. Throw on a ghillie mantle to cover your tracks for the more fierce monsters, but explore and capture small creatures you find. This game has fantastic monster behaviours. In the Rotten Vale, I suddenly found myself next to an Odogaron, and I prepared to fight him after he roared, but soon he continued walking away. Following him from a distance, I then found him going about his daily routine, which was scavenging for food to bring back to his den. Every monster has their own quirks out of combat. They're not soulless creatures, which makes the experience even more fun knowing that they are closer to animals than virtual creatures created for slaying. \n\n4. The obvious, \"do all the quests.\" Optional quests, other quests. Every quest. Blue completed optional quests do not count, you must make them orange! Do this, and reach HR100 so that you can simulate the final episode of Neon Genesis: Evangelion and just be congratulated by everyone. \n\n5. Finally, make your own builds, use whatever weapons you want. Every weapon is viable in this game. If you like the look of a weapon, use it. It doesn't matter, make it yours. You can use meta weapons and meta builds, and while it may be fun for a while, it may get dull. Do something unique, take chances with your builds and find something that suits you. Vitality decorations mat be useless for someone's build, but it may save the life of a build built around fast regeneration and maximum immortality. \n\nThat's about it. I'm writing this late at night, so excuse typos. \nMaybe those things to do will help you out a bit. Maybe it'll squeeze out a few more hours, or maybe it'll conjure a few hundred.

Here are my personal opinions on the positives and the negatives of this game.\n\nPros:\n+ Extremely engaging hunts\n+ 14 different base weapons, with tons of different variations for each from the monsters. The weapons have such satisfying impact.\n+ The environments feel atmospheric, and it feels smooth to navigate through the jungles and all the other locales.\n+ Unique artstyle\n+ Frequent updates with festivals, collaborations (Megaman, Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy, Witcher, etc) and new monsters added, Behemoth being the last new monster to be added before the eventual Iceborne expansion.\nExtremely hard versions of the already implemented monsters in the form of Arch-Tempered monsters are added for the duration of events, each offering a more powerful armor set. Also Layered armor sets.\n+ Max 4 Player Co op, coop is very well implemented, save for the very janky experience if you're trying to play co-op during story missions. There are strange limitations before a friend can join, for example you have to see all the cutscenes. But most of monster hunter happens outside of story, and that's where it shines. Its just a pleasure to play with others.\n+ Complex character build opportunities, you can mix different sets to get your optimal build, and you can insert jewels into slots in the armors that give you additional skills.\n+ The progression feels so fulfilling, even through the 100h mark you wont feel bored.\n+ You have crafting systems, before a hunt you have to eat a meal to grant you different buffs for your next hunt, you can farm ingredients, you can meld decorations (the jewels) and you can sent your Palicoes for an adventure to bring you loot.\n+ Hunts have such fun hijinks, monsters disturbing your encounters with another monster, they have turf wars, and overall hunts turn into a pleasant chaos.\n+ The Switchaxe\n+ Great community overall, people put effort into their guild cards and most people are helpful during hunts. No real toxicity. \n+ You really shouldn't have to mention this, but yeah no microtransactions. Probably why the game feels so good in this day and age.\n+Ultrawide support's here! Took a while but they did it.\n\nCons:\n- A mediocre story.\n- Annoying handler, seems to take all the glory for the hunts, even though never participating actually in any. A liability.\n- Performance has been optimized imo, but still I dip occasionally below the 40fps, and one of the recent patches kinda botched the performance.\n- SOS hunts tend to be a bit infuriating, because some players just are potatoes. So carts happen a bit too much at times.\n- I'm not sure, but I think the game has a desire sensor. Curse it!\n-  Bazelgeuse keeps popping up in all the wrong times.\n- (Edit:) Co-op does suffer from a few hitches early on in the game when you're doing story missions with friends. You first have to enter the quest alone and see all the cutscenes before your friends can join in, which is just frustrating.\n\n\nIf this game appears in a sale or even at it's full price this game

"english", "review": "Simply put, if you like the essence of grinding, then, you'll love the game in general. If you are only here to finish the story, then, it can be achieved without much grinding but keep in mind that, the story of Monster Hunter World is there only for the sake of being there; it's nothing extraordinary & shouldn't be your only reason to buy the game. That being said, grind is a must if you want to venture beyond the story & lust for some of the best gears & late monsters in the game.\n\nNow, the core strength of this game undoubtedly lies in the various monsters that lurks around the world. Monsters are effing brutal, each with their own distinct characteristics & abilities. Each & every of them feels like a boss fight. Preapre to spend good 10-15 mins(or even more) to take down a monster as they are quite tanky but the pleasure of besting them surely feels incredible.\n\nApart from the monsters, the gameplay mechanic is solid as rock, coupled with the gorgeous ambience. The game sounds good, looks better, plays best. Total of 14 different types of weapons with skillsets, playstyles & combos that's unique from one another. Freaking tons of badass looking armors, deep customization system & crafting options are at your disposal to make your life easy when you take on those mystical creatures of doom.\n\nIf you want to solo only, albeit surely possible, it may get a bit difficult or tedious. Best played with mates of course, and, the multiplayer system is being implemented in such a fluid way that you can join others(& vice versa) very easily without any hassle.\nNo server issues anymore as well.\n\nOnly gripe that I have is that joining the story quest in multiplayer isn't as seamless as joining those optional quests. I had to reach a certain point(cutscenes) of every story related missions & only after that my friends could join which made my experience a bit disjointed. Also, some quests where I had to search for monster tracks felt really exhausting & monotonous beacuse I had to return to hub & come again repeatedly to search for it to fill the bar.\n\nSo, overall, I would recommend this game if grinding is your cup of tea as you'll be battling with the same monsters again & again for those exotic loots. If not, I would still recommend it to buy with your friends to experience some epic monster fights in co op, but, on sale.", "timestamp_created": 1537183673, "timestamp_updated": 1537188981, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 162, "votes_funny": 5, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874188423156738281", "comment_count": 13, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44509964": {"recommendationid": "44509964", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027515743", "num_games_owned": 169, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 10740, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 2237, "last_played": 1551541118}, "language": "english", "review": "Early game: This set looks awesome, Im gonna wear this forever\n\nLate game: I look like a clown but I hit like a truck", "timestamp_created": 1535812782, "timestamp_updated": 1535870464, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 842, "votes_funny": 1224, "weighted_vote_score": "0.899801552295684814", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48500348": {"recommendationid": "48500348", "author": {"steamid": "76561197973568370", "num_games_owned": 403, "num_reviews": 17, "playtime_forever": 31583, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 67, "last_played": 1550717752}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]The best game released in 2018 without a shread of doubt in my eyes.[/h1]\n\nUnfortunately it had a bit of a rocky start, in addition to some odd decisions.\n\nMost negative reviews on this game will most likely talk about \"connection issues\", MHW had quite the rocky start regarding server stability. \nThose issues are long gone now, the only times I get disconnected nowadays I only have my own internet to blame. If you go looking at the negative reviews, pay attention to how many hours they have played and think about that.\n\nThe secondary thing I feel mentioning upfront is that while this is a game where cooperation is highly encouraged, for some reason other players can't join your story quests if you haven't seen the cutscenes first. \nThis can be rather annoying if you are playing together with friends, and unfortunately there is no good solution for the players. \nSo you'll end up having to do the quest alone, watch the cutscene and wait for the notification that you can use SOS Flare. At that point your friends can join, alternatively you leave the quest and group up together with your friends, doesn't matter.\n\nThere aren't *that* many of the story missions, the meat and bone of the game is beyond the story so to speak.\n\nWith that out of the way.... (just skip to bottom if tl;dr)\n\n[h1]Visuals[/h1]\n\nThis game is absolutely gorgeous! The environments are beautiful, there's plenty of places to explore, paths to find, things both inanimate and living to collect and obviously monsters to hunt...\n\nYou'll be able to see a monster from far away, so if you have clear line of sight you can spot monsters much further away than other games would allow.\n\nThe monsters look fantastic, and they actually have like routines to their daily life. So if you are sneaky enough, you can follow after a monster and watch it as it goes about its business. It'll mark its territory, leave foot prints, maybe spit/puke on trees and the ground and of course hunt. The monsters don't take kindly to others coming close, neither hunters or  other monsters. So while you're hunting one monsters, you might find another monster who decides to fight the monster you're hunting! \n\nIn fact, everything in this game looks great. Except for the handler, but you can change her looks with mods if it is too much.\n\n[h1]Combat[/h1]\n\nThis game probably has one of the deepest combat systems I know of.\n\nWhen you start playing, you'll get the choice between the basic metal version of all the weapons.\nYour choices are: [list]\n[*] Great Sword\n[*] Sword & Shield\n[*] Dual Blades\n[*] Long Blades\n[*] Hammer\n[*] Hunting Horn\n[*] Lance\n[*] Gunlance\n[*] Switch Axe\n[*] Charge Blade\n[*] Insect Glaive\n[*] Bow\n[*] Light Bowgun\n[*] Heavy Bowgun\n[/list]\nThere is no [b]right[/b] choice when it comes to picking a weapon. While some situations might feel better with certain weapons especially if you're still learning, overall all the weapons are very balanced and offer quite different play styles.\n\nNot only do the weapons offer a nice diversity in play styles, most/all of the weapons have a surprisingly deep system of attacks and combos.\n\nAs an example; the great sword might seem real straight forward, but it has a move that can be surprisingly effective against monsters. Normally you'll be slamming that baby down on the monster, and if it attacks you'll try to block or dodge. However! If you master the shoulder attack, you can interrupt the monster's attack and possibly even stagger it, leaving it exposed for more hurting.\n\nAnother example is the insect glaive, essentially a polearm that comes with an insect that you can feed to make it more powerful. With it you can jump up a little to do aerial attacks, or swing around on the ground. But if you take the time to collect essence from the monster(s) you hunt, you'll unlock stronger combos and even aerial attacks that allow you to stay airborne for as long as your stamina and/or essence lasts!\n\nThere are many examples like this, so if I feel somewhat tired of a certain weapon I can just change to a different one for a completely different feeling in both tempo, damage, and intensity. For example, if I'm lazy I'll just go gunlance and play it safe. But don't mistake that for gunlance being a tame weapon, in the right hands it can destroy monsters.\n\nIn some cases, the weapon has a different playstyle based on the upgrade path you picked for it.\nThe weapons can deal all sorts of damage. Anything from the typical elements like fire, ice, thunder over to stuff like poison, dragon (yes) and even debilitating effects like paralysing and even sleep. Yes the monster can be forcefully made to fall asleep during combat, for reasons you'll discover.\n\nWhen it comes to actually hunting the monsters there is [b]ONE[/b] important thing to always do.\n[h1]Observe the monster.[/h1]\nThat's dead serious. Capcom's Monster Hunter series is one that rewards patience and due dilligence. When you fight a new monster, focus on just understanding it first. How it moves for attacks, roars, where it normally hunts, where it roams and even where it sleeps... If you don't pay attention, the combat can quickly become punishing or as some might say, \"like dark souls!!!\".\nUnlike that game, the attacks of the monsters are well telegraphed (most of the time) and while a monster can feel really overwhelming in the beginning, with time you will conquer it and dominate it.\n\nThe monsters are well designed, both for combat and movement. While some fights can feel frustrating because of the hit boxes being slightly misleading on certain monsters, it's overall a very fair system. You'll learn the ins-and-outs of the monsters in no time.\n\n[h1]Levels/skills?[/h1]\n\nThere are no levels in this game. There is hunter rank, but it's mostly just an indicator of how much time you've spent hunting. So a HR 50 have as much HP and stamina as a HR 1 player.\n\nThe difference comes down to the armor, decorations and of course the weapon they are carrying. \nThe gear you choose will eventually have more to them than just defence and resistances, they will have skills available.\n\nSome skills will increase your max HP, some will increase your raw damage, some will increase elemental damage, some will make you dodge further or even make you eat faster! (yes)\nAdditionally more powerful equipment will even have set bonuses. \n\nTo obtain the gear you want, will require lots of hunting and that's half the game.\n\nThe game loop can probably be summarized as plainly as this\n\nHunt monsters for materials, use the materials to craft better gear, use the improved gear to hunter stronger monsters and keep trying to reach higher and higher!\n\nIt sounds simple, but that satisfaction of finally beating a monster you've been struggling with is so good. It's a game where you can noticably see the difference between the \"old you\" and the \"new you\" after playing for a good while. \nI currently have 430 hours in the game, there is still so much for me to learn.\n\nI barely know how bowguns work, I have never used charged blade and there are many weapons I don't use much or haven't mastered yet. So I wouldn't be surprised if I find myself having more than 1000 hours in this, because it's just so [b]fun[/b] hunting with the weapons in MHW.\n\nLooking forward to the events that are still coming to MHW, and I especially look forward to the announced expansion Iceborne.\n\nI don't really know what more to say. I love this game, it's fun, it's a game I can keep coming back to for more action. In a way, this is my \"skinner box\" game. Good thing I picked a game that doesn't have microtransactions or loot boxes. \nJust pure quality and fun (and some pain...)\n\nTL;DR\n\nYou hunt huge monsters with cool weapons\nYou can mount the monsters\nYou can use a wide variety of weapons\n\nIt's a really satisfying game with a good repetition loop. It's an easy game to get into, and hard to master. Just gotta play it at your pace.\n\nIgnoring the nitpicks I have about it, a 10/10 game.", "timestamp_created": 1548226765, "timestamp_updated": 1548226831, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 132, "votes_funny": 6, "weighted_vote_score": "0.829700052738189697", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "48450651": {"recommendationid": "48450651", "author": {"steamid": "76561198124424531", "num_games_owned": 96, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 45059, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 939, "last_played": 1551656632}, "language": "english", "review": "Oh man, I can't do this game justice in a steam review. Get it. Get it even if you never played any of the games before. Get it and try to at least get to the credits and see how the game treats you. It may be frustrating or stressful to play at first or seem maybe boring at first glance, but the second you make that first push, oh man, it's like nothing else in gaming. Maybe the servers seem to treat you badly but it's really not that bad compared to the sheer good the game offers. It's really not intrusive at all and you can reconnect from the main menu. Connection->recently played or somesuch. You're welcome.\n\nFull transparency: I am a huge Monster Hunter fanboy. Full-on, rabid fanboy. I can however, without bias, tell you that Monster Hunter World is the best Monster Hunter game made so far. From a technical, conceptual and executional standpoint. I could tell you the technicalities of the game, but everyone does that already so if you're into that then you're wasting your time reading this. This is why my first sentence is what it is. I can't do the game justice here. I've written and rewritten what I wanted this part to be many times but it's just not coming together. I can't say it easily. It can't be said easily. It has to be peeled back layer by layer, but if you're a newbie, then probably nothing of it would mean much, if anything at all. \n\nSo you want to get into Monster hunter? Fine, ...fine.\n\nGo, and type: \"Monster Hunter Zero\" into the Youtube searchbar and watch the video from the channel: \"folga\". Even if you have the game already or have started Monster Hunting relatively recently. Done? Play this game. With friends/family if you can. Convince 'em. Did you like it? Play Iceborne when it comes. Play at least one of the previous games if you can. If there's a will, there's always a ship willing to sail you in that department. My recommendations are: Monster Hunter, Monster Hunter Freedom, Monster Hunter Dos, Monster Hunter Freedom Unite, Monster Hunter Tri and 3U separately, Monster Hunter Portable 3rd, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate and Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate. In that order and one by one if you can do all. FU&P3rd or GU if you can't. This is important: Don't rush. Did the new MH after Iceborne come out? Play it. Think you done enough? Are you satisfied? Can you swing a fish to beat up some dinosaurs with now? How about a chainsaw? Two chainsaws!? A bone? Use cats to beat up cats. Eat some Kirin Cheese. Eat some wyvern head. Shoot unlimited elemental works from a weapon no one cares about. Make the coolest looking sword straight out of Gothic 2. Or a drill from TTGL. Or beat up Gurren Lagann. Make a mix set. Make 50 mix sets. Try out a new weapon. Sharpen your weapon back up to yellow. Sharpen your hammer, sharpen your anvil, sharpen yor bagpipe, sharpen your recorder-bell, sharpen your wyvern head. Go into mud. Go into lava. Go into water. Go down into a hole. Go up a mountain. Get deep into the jungle. Lie down into sand. Listen. Catch fish. Catch bugs. Especially the Killer Beetle. No wait.. Shinig Beetle? Shine on you... Killer Queen..?? Take those sweet as.s jeans and dodge some bayblade spins and boom-booms from a living train. Get rabies. Eat a pill that gives you rabies. Curse that flying as.shole that he left the area again. Look into those blue eyes and hate them and then love them and then be annoyed and then be content. Pick up some poop, pick up some rocks, pick up some weed and shrooms to heal yourself with. Collect honey and post how many you got. Time out on trying to get specific fish. Time out trying to find a flying chode. Triple cart, quad cart! Get rocks thrown at you by a cucumber, get rocks thrown at you by a monkey, get poop thrown at you by a monkey, get snow thrown at you by a monkey, get spit on by a monkey. Get blown up and away, get poisoned and die trying to find the antidote you didn't pack. Get eviscerated, get smashed and then get smart, get fed and get your revenge. Reload your bowgun, reload your flintlock rifle, reload your armcannon, reload the siege cannon, reload your axe. Look at those ruins, so mysterious. Steal some barrels and acorn from cats. Have your pills stolen by cats. Give your cats acorns and barrels and boomerangs. You can find that tower in the jungle right? Go up to the top. Find silver and find gold. Let your gavel ring justice off ther thin tin skulls. Find speed and find serenity. Find wind, find the flames, find the mists and find a phantom lightning bolt. Find yourself in a world of poison and fire, in a world of poison and water, in a world of greenery and blood, in a world of snow and wind, in a world of the sun, moon and sands. Then you know what? Go sail a bit. Sail on the sea of sand. Marvel at the swimming mountains. Then sail on water. Ponder why it's so strange. Ponder why the story is so bad, but the lore so cool.

It still has some issues that I will explain in a moment.\n\nThis review was specifically made for those who have a low-end PC. I want to share my actual specs and current graphic setting to try and reach 1080p 60fps.\n\nMY BUILD \n\nCPU: AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00GHz\nVideo Card: AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 4GB VRAM\nRAM: 12 GB\nStorage: Hybrid HD-SSD\n\nAs you can tell, it's not impressive, something Low-Mid for today standards.\n\nGRAPHIC SETTINGS IN MONSTER HUNTER WORLD\n\nFrame Rate (cap): 60.\n\nV-Sync: Off. \nI rather tweak some settings with my Radeon software to try and fix the V-Sync, so I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far. The thing is, the built-in V-Sync in the game is very taxing. \nFPS cost: HIGH\n\nResolution Scaling: Low. \nThe difference is noticeable between Low/Med/High, but the fps jump is kinda noticeable as well, specially in open areas (which is VERY common in the game). Since I'm playing on a 49\" HDTV from a distance I can't tell much of a difference, so I leave it in Low. \nFPS cost: LOW.\n\nTexture Quality: 1024. \nTested on lower values but hardly see any difference... until cutscenes showed up. Close ups also shows the degraded quality on textures, fortunately FPS is stable at max. \nFPS cost: VERY LOW.\n\nAmbient Occlussion: Off. \nAdds more detail on the environment, but I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on low. \nFPS cost: MEDIUM\n\nVolume Rendering Quality: Off. \nThis is it, the bane of the FPS. Console users will recognize it as the fog, the one to blame all those fps drops; it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuff, but you can't see past the fog sometimes. This is no Nintendo 64, so no need to leave it on. \nFPS Cost: EXTREMELY HIGH.\n\nShadow Quality: Low. \nThe shadows in the game are already good; sure you will see some low quality shadows cast from the characters, but it definitely won't bother you, also you will save a lot of FPS. \nFPS cost: HIGH\n\nAnti-Aliasing: Off. \nI personally override the settings with Radeon settings, I use AMD's AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settings, which makes blurry edges, specially FXAA. Jaggies can be seen, but doesn't bother me that much. \nFPS Cost: MEDIUM\n\nLOD Bias: Low. \nThis defines how detailed the objects are from a distance. I generally switch between low and medium, but the drop in FPS is kinda noticeable.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM.\n\nMax LOD Level: No Limit. \nWill switch between -1 and No Limit, but it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimes, so I leave it in No Limit, also, it doesn't punish my FPS that hard.\nFPS cost: LOW.\n\nFoliage Sway: On. \nI want the game to look good and alive. Static foliage is not good, nor alive.\nFPS cost: VERY LOW.\n\nSubsurface Scattering: On.\nI like to see very detailed skin on characters, definitely looks bad without it, specially in cutscenes.\nFPS cost: LOW \n\nScreen Space Reflection: Off.\nHow objects reflect the environment. FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM\n\nAnisotropic Filtering: Off.\nThe detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM\n\nWater Reflection: On.\nI honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.\nFPS cost: LOW\n\nSH Diffuse Quality: Low.\nThere is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.\nFPS cost: MEDIUM \n\nDynamic Range: 64-Bit. \nLeft on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.\nFPS: LOW\n\nZ-Prepass: On.\nI honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.\nFPS cost: LOW\n\n\nAfter all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.\n\nHad already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.\n\nThe game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.\nCharacter customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)\nYou have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.\nIt has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.\nIt has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.\nIt has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.\nYou have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.\nThere's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. \nYou can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say \"finish\", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.\n\nNow, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. \nDisconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.\n\nYou will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.\n\nSome users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.\n\nSome users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.\nSpeaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.\n\nGraphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.\nIf you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.\nIf you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.\n\nBetter yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.\n\nSo, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better.", "timestamp_created": 1534018576, "timestamp_updated": 1534719825, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 1624, "votes_funny": 63, "weighted_vote_score": "0.928869426250457764", "comment_count": 82, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47721636": {"recommendationid": "47721636", "author": {"steamid": "76561198062523677", "num_games_owned": 685, "num_reviews": 9, "playtime_forever": 13758, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 290, "last_played": 1551555043}, "language": "english", "review": "I had never played a Monster Hunter game before this, but World has definitely turned me into a fan.

This game has single handily murdered my RL commitments within its first 2 weeks of being out. This review may be geared more toward newcomers such as myself. It has some issues Ill get into, but I'm also gonna explain what it is, and why it\u2019s so damn fun. \n\nSo wtf is it then? In a nut shell, there are 5 big open worlds/maps. These maps have huge monsters that you have to track down, kill, and harvest their glorious innards. You yourself do not level up. You\u2019ll pick from 1 of 14 weapons (which is like your class, and you can switch em out as well if you wanna try others) and craft better weapons and armor from the parts you farm from monsters. You have a central hub (Astera) you\u2019ll probably spend a lot of your time in, running side missions, while also progressing through the story and unlocking new maps, monsters, and adding/upgrading beneficial NPC hubs  within Astera. There\u2019s so much content in this game it\u2019s ridiculous. \n\nThings will start out slow, confusing and pretty damn difficult. You\u2019ll prob have to google some sh*t and some of the fights, especially your first time going in, can last up to 30 minutes. You\u2019ll have to learn the fights, learn the environments, learn your weapon, and learn what items you\u2019ll need to bring. You craft almost everything in the game, from the coatings on your arrows, food, traps, to different potions for different situations. Everything is harvestable from the world; plants, nuts, animals, bugs, fishing, etc.\nAs you progress through the story you\u2019ll go up in Hunter Rank. The story itself is pretty much one long tutorial and as you complete story missions your Hunter Rank goes up, allowing you to take on stronger monsters as you become more powerful.\n\nYou can play the entire game SP or MP. For me I would say 60-70% of my time has been spent playing with RL friends. This is were the fun and the problems come in.\nAs of right now MHW has a pretty bad connection problem. From what Ive read, it\u2019s worse for people who try and run match making exclusively. Me and my friends alone, we have connection issues but it\u2019s not nearly as bad as others are reporting. I'm not saying the problem doesn\u2019t exist, but for us its not unplayable.   Honestly it has varied day-to-day. Some days are worse than others. When it does happen, it literally take 5-10 seconds to reconnect. Sh*t can be frustrating at times, especially mid fight, but it\u2019s not something that's constantly happening to us.\n\nAnother thing, when you\u2019re out on a hunt, you can send up an \u201cSOS\u201d. If you or someone else needs a part from a certain monster, they can respond to this sos and now you have a party of 4 going after the same target. This is the only way I play MP when not playing with friends, and again, I haven\u2019t had a terrible experience with it. It has issues like the rest of the game\u2019s connection issues but nothing as broken as Ive read in various forums. I have never tried to connect to match making so I cant comment on that outside what others are saying. There are currently 2 patches Capcom have been testing that are showing up in steamdb. I should also note that I usually dont play until after 7pm est.\n\nOther user complaints have been about performance. Again, maybe I\u2019m just lucky. There are reportedly fixes but I haven\u2019t had to do anything. 980ti/i5 4670k/latest Nvidia driver and I\u2019m running 50-60 fps mid-high settings @2560x1440. I do get dips in the 40s but again, nothing game breaking, not for me at least.\n\nSo thats pretty much it. Ive had a sh*t ton of fun running through the game with friends. Ive not played a good MP game in awhile and this game definitely hits the spot. There is just so much stuff to do, goals to set on what you wanna do next, helping each other out and so on. The above issues are from my personal experience and in no way am I saying those problems don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s a f*cking fantastic game that\u2019s unfortunately getting review bombed due to Capcom\u2019s slow (or almost lacking I should say) response.\n\n[b]Connection Update[/b]\nOn 22 Aug, the same day I posted this review, Capcom patched the game. The patch was intended to reduce connection issues for folks while they continued to iron it out. Ive had about 30 hrs play time since, and have honestly had 0 connection issues, playing as I do, mentioned in the review. Playing with friends in our own lobbies, or running SOS missions. I have had 0 disconnects, 0 MW errors. Every single MP mission Ive started with friends or ran in SOSs since the patch has ended without a single connection drop. Some people are still reporting issues with match making or joining random lobbies. I cant comment on these issues since I dont ever join them.", "timestamp_created": 1534936395, "timestamp_updated": 1535417528, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 628, "votes_funny": 18, "weighted_vote_score": "0.926725327968597412", "comment_count": 12, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44758297": {"recommendationid": "44758297", "author": {"steamid": "76561197990549491", "num_games_owned": 661, "num_reviews": 15, "playtime_forever": 6944, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1539986608}, "language": "english", "review": "I'd like to stop playing, but I have some more weapons and armor to craft.

I've regretted at least once paying for any other game I've played but this! This is even worth more ( I don't want it to be more but for what they set price to and the content we've received is unbelievable ) . Again I'm not that much of fan of previous game versions or ever played them.  But this game was amazing. \nPros : collaborations and play the game looking like the character you've played in other games and fighting dragons and monsters : ride, slay, capture and even throw dung at their face to make them flee away! The weapons and their usage unlike other games if you want to support or DPS you dont need to create new character and level or farm items in it. The same character you're using can be anything!\nCons: Some connection issues at first but they did compensate as much as they can. Some bugs exist but which game doesn't have them ? And extremely powerful monsters and strategies ( and when I say strategies they are not that complicated and everyone can sure get them but just need to understand things around. If not what is the fun in making strategies if they aren't at least hard to make ) But either ways strategies can be copied from internet if you want to as all games. No grind and grind so much time and no force you to buy anything. \nSummary: No Pay to Win! Now this is important. Expansions are incoming and they are huge and will be on sale. But except that one expansion everything else is your choice to get it or not! They even gave 2 character editing vouchers to change your character looks. What else is needed for a game. But the requirements and all are a bit high compared to some low tier pc(s).  But its time to update graphics imho. Till when will you sit and blame the games that they are having high specifications and all. You wont be sitting around your old graphic cards forever ( No offense though). \nIn total I would rate the game to 9/10 and it has some improvements for the last 1 point that are just acceptable imo.", "timestamp_created": 1545438287, "timestamp_updated": 1545438287, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 135, "votes_funny": 13, "weighted_vote_score": "0.778105378150939941", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45169445": {"recommendationid": "45169445", "author": {"steamid": "76561198118880128", "num_games_owned": 105, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 13707, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550557534}, "language": "english", "review": "If you are new to Monster Hunter, prepare for the long hour journey and, mostly, grind to fulfill your inner OCD to collect all types of weapon and all kinds of armor in the game. Haha.\n\nThe game went from disastrous release to a smooth sail in a couple of weeks. After a few tweaks and fix here and there from Capcom, Monster Hunter World is finally enjoyable on PC. The most annoying issues I had before was connectivity and mouse camera control that feel sluggish (even though I mainly use gamepad, but sometimes switch to mouse/keyboard). Now:\n- No more server issues.\n- Mouse camera controls are very fluid.\n\nThe graphic is certainly amazing. It is certainly a major improvement from previous installment in the series.  Some people are complaining about low texture quality, but I don't feel bothered with it because when I'm on the hunt, don't usually pay much attention to it.\n\nThe gameplay is challenging as ever, with ridiculous hitboxes and the sluggish movement of your character even when using light weapon like dual blade or sword & shield. But all that hurdle will be rewarded with the iconic music at the end of the quest, but with the most awkward last hit. \"A little poke to the toe of that Nergigante, bam, quest finished. Okay I guess, let's carve it.\"\n\nI think things that lacking now are, the optimization of keyboard control (Rename loadout with escape? Oh come on. And don't forget to press F1-F4 first before using items in quest), and the lack of meaningful event. I get it, baby steps toward better future right? But those steps're better be like Xeno'jiva's one, or people will lose patiences with this already scarce roster of monsters.\n\nAll in all, I think this game deserve to be put in your library.

The monsters are a joy to fight, which is important when that's the main draw of your product.  The atmosphere of each environment is engrossing, and the monsters really feel like they belong there.  It can be surprisingly relaxing to just head out on an Expedition with no quest or goal in mind and wander aimlessly through each zone, collecting materials for crafting, doing some bounties, catching some fish, or going after the monsters that happen to be in the area at that time on the fly with no faint limit or time limit(aside from when the monster itself decides to leave the zone).  Each zone being one contiguous location instead of chopped up into several smaller bits like previous entries really helps give it a lived-in feeling, like coming upon the remnants of a turf war between two monsters that happened while I was busy halfway across the map with something else is a neat touch.  Monsters, especially the notorious Bazelgeuse(Bagel Goose), often get wrapped up in your fights with other monsters, and can sometimes provide a much-needed distraction or deal a hugely damaging blow to the one you're focusing on.  The weapon systems are extremely varied and unique, with many weapons using completely different mechanics making them akin to fighting game character selections when you pick which to use.  I personally have only ever used the Greatsword, there's something so totally satisfying about landing that last overhead wallop with it that sends a monster crashing to the ground, stunned.  I have heard from other folks that pretty much every other weapon system is fun to use and engaging.  Collecting materials to build and upgrade each weapon can be difficult and the requirements of some extremely rare drop items for later high-end craftable gear can get super frustrating to acquire, unfortunately.  Same goes for certain consumables, though there are alternative options such as the Melding system to acquire rarer items you need using lesser-desired items you already have.  I run the game on a pretty beefy system, but even at lower settings I've heard the game runs pretty well.  The only complaints I really have about the game running well is it's a big CPU hog, and the textures in cutscenes can be real nasty, but I hear that's a bug that's set to be fixed in an upcoming patch.  Otherwise the game runs at a buttery smooth framerate, dynamically lowering object/texture quality ingame to keep the framerate steady, and the load times are basically nonexistant.  The longest load time is when you first boot up the game, and even then it's like 15 seconds tops.  Every other load time is so fast you don't even have time to read the loading screen tips.\n\nedit: I should mention I play the game entirely solo, I have never done multiplayer.  I am not a fan of the faint limit being tied to all players, so one goober can ruin it for everyone else if they're bad, which I've seen plenty of times on streams.  The Palico system, your cat-shaped AI buddy, is very helpful in fights, acting as a distraction, support, summoning helpers, looting extra monster parts mid-battle, etc.  Plus dressing them up in the various goofy or cute outfits is nice.  I just wish there was a dog option.  A Palicorgi, if you will.  Odogaron's armor makes them look like some sort of ancient japanese wardog thing, but other than that it's all cats all the time, which sucks.  I'd totally buy dog-shaped AI buddy cosmetic DLC.\n\nOverall, Monster Hunter World's been a real surprise.  I'd caught some streams and felt it would be worth trying myself once it came to PC, but didn't expect to fall so far into it, I think as of this review I've got 150 or 170 hours in it, beaten the story, downed every optional quest, found every food item(except a few different boozes), captured/slain every tempered monster, and still have fun playing it.

(That's about how long the intro takes before you can play with friends.)\n\nI am having a blast with this game. I didn't play other Monster Hunter games in the past, but I did play the hell out of Dragon's Dogma. A lot of these mechanics feel familiar, from the UI design to companion characters, and how bosses and elemental effects work. Supposedly World drifts from the MH forumula a tad and I guess that's right, but being like DD isn't bad either. Feels more like an RPG than a pure Boss Run game, which I prefer personally.\n\nI'm on track to clock hundreds of hours into this game. It's all I can think about while at work or out and about. How to tackle the next monster, what gear I need to build, what materials I need to gather to prep. The environments are beautiful so far, I love the monster variety. I love the way they fight over territory. I love the amount of weapon variety, there's all types for every kind of player. I really think it's worth a buy. \n\nMy only con is that cosmetically I have little choice of my armor selection, as skills/talents are tied to specific peices of gear. So you end up looking like a mishmash clown. I am hoping they add more layered outfit choices (all that's available currently is the Samurai outfit), because they aren't seeming like they're going to implement cosmetic item slots or let you dye the regular armor types, unfortunately. But even then, I am too distracted by what the monster is doing to worry about what I look like most of the time.", "timestamp_created": 1534248771, "timestamp_updated": 1534248771, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 815, "votes_funny": 40, "weighted_vote_score": "0.874415874481201172", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44024172": {"recommendationid": "44024172", "author": {"steamid": "76561198038456274", "num_games_owned": 296, "num_reviews": 1, "playtime_forever": 12111, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549574917}, "language": "english", "review": "In the beginning it wouldn't recognize my controller, however this was fixed by going to Steam>Settings>Controller>General Controller Settings and activating Xbox 360 Controller there.\n\nBerry nice game otherwise.", "timestamp_created": 1533838455, "timestamp_updated": 1533864731, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 525, "votes_funny": 37, "weighted_vote_score": "0.837386965751647949", "comment_count": 15, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "45268919": {"recommendationid": "45268919", "author": {"steamid": "76561198027075611", "num_games_owned": 293, "num_reviews": 18, "playtime_forever": 14989, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1550229014}, "language": "english", "review": "[h1]Connection problems were patched long ago.[/h1]\n\nThis is the first port of Monster Hunter to PC, it's not the best port but it's not bad either, now for the good and bad:\n\n[h1]Good things:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]A lot of weapon types and elements to choose from\n    [*]A lot of skills wich you can choose from to make your own build\n    [*]New content is currently being added by Capcom (This is being written in 10/14/2018, Autumn Event)\n    [*]Quite a lot of farming to do for parts, augments and decorations\n    [*]Multiplayer has been fixed so you can play with people whenever you want\n    [*]You'll have a lot of hours to go if you're a completionist or like farming / slashing big monsters in the shortest time possible\n    [*]As some people say that keyboard controls suck you can re-map every key to your confort\n    [*]It's on PC, you can mod away all the visuals if you want to as well as some QoL mods\n    [*]The only microtransaction present in this game is purely cosmetic\n    [*]The OST and visuals are beautiful\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Bad Things:[/h1]\n[list]\n    [*]Farming can be quite tedious until you have some equipment done (by that time you might get burned out of using that weapon and bored out of farming the same monsters over and over)\n    [*]It's obvious that some weapons are superior to others in the same tree so some monsters will not be really farmed after comlpeting low rank\n    [*]After you end the Low Rank and High Rank missions (20-40h) you're left with events, arena, optional quests and investigation farming.

The original console version of MHW was released in January 2018, with a PC adaption in August 2018.\n\n[i] Pro & contra: [/i]\n\n++ Gameplay. Easy to learn, but hard to master. Each weapon (14+) demands a different tactical approach in combat. The various monsters have their own attack patterns, weaknesses and environments. Hunting and gathering facilitate the creation of better weapons and armour. This in turn allows for specialized equipment in order to hunt bigger beasts.\n + Level design. The different world areas are full of rich detail and offer plenty to discover. The flora and fauna provides an endless array of useful collectibles.\n+ Companion. Your feline sidekick can be customized, has some useful skills, and will support you in combat. Yet, the Japanese obsession with cats has been pushed to its extreme in this game.\n\no Multiplayer. The flexible cooperative MP options let you play the numbers game to take down your adversaries. But the irregular disconnects will lead to rage inducing moments.\n\n- Story & characters. Boring Godzilla scenario threatening the invaders of the new world. Clich\u00e9d characters & silent protagonist. A fraction of the content is synchronized. Console based text progression.\n- PC adaption. Every action you take in this game beginning with the submenu navigation, over inventory management, down to drinking a potion - while being chased by a fire-breathing monstrosity - will remind you of its console roots. Little effort has been invested into the adaptive work for the PC version.\n\n[I] Summary: [/i]\n\nPersonally, I feel it deserves most of the praise it has received and I enjoy the gameplay immensely. The hunting and gathering culture represents the core element of the game, and it has been excellently executed. Nevertheless, it is being held back from being great by the suboptimal story-telling, PC adaption, and reoccurring server issues.\n\nRecommended for curious adventurers and people with a cat fetish.\n\n[i] Achievements: [/i]\n\nKeep in mind that this game is a random number generated grind festival. \n\nEstimated time for 100 % completion: +200 hours\n\nOffline achievements: 45\nOnline achievements: 5", "timestamp_created": 1535647682, "timestamp_updated": 1536611633, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 236, "votes_funny": 11, "weighted_vote_score": "0.820464372634887695", "comment_count": 24, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "46191101": {"recommendationid": "46191101", "author": {"steamid": "76561198091774047", "num_games_owned": 24, "num_reviews": 3, "playtime_forever": 37107, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 84, "last_played": 1550912778}, "language": "english", "review": "G.O.T.Y , MHW is getting better for PC", "timestamp_created": 1542870489, "timestamp_updated": 1542870489, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 89, "votes_funny": 7, "weighted_vote_score": "0.696158349514007568", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44363568": {"recommendationid": "44363568", "author": {"steamid": "76561198001490367", "num_games_owned": 501, "num_reviews": 130, "playtime_forever": 41033, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 85, "last_played": 1550768914}, "language": "english", "review": "[b][h1]\u201cIn the aspect of ambitious Hunter and friendly Nyan\u201d[/h1][/b]\nI want to talk about my aspect of game as overall experience. Although, there's some issues from PC porting, but it doesn\u2019t hide the fact I still enjoy the game.\n\n[h1]Welcome, Rookies and Veterans [/h1]\nMonster Hunter: World (MHW) is considered as fifth generation of Monster Hunter series developed by Capcom. You play as hunter, receive task to hunt or capture various monsters as they reward you their components for advanced weapons and armors. Unlike previous titles, MHW is designed to introduce new players with more casual gameplay and new mechanics, yet it still remains complex and challenge hunting as core gameplay in seamless environment. MHW is powered by MT framework game engine (same as Dragon\u2019s Dogma, RE, DMC) with improve AI and Havok physics to simulate realistic experience and most alive world in the series. \n\n[h1]The Hunter\u2019s Story [/h1]\nThe story takes place in part of New World. You play as a hunter of Fifth Fleet (customized via character creation), working on expedition to study the migration of Elder Dragons. The team first encounters Zorah Magdaros, one of massive Elder Dragon which motivates research team and hunter to track down Zorah as part of main campaign. Story is not always the strongest selling-point of the series. MHW did its best to create believable plot and backstory via high quality cutscenes and environment background. Overall, the story is quite enjoyable, even though it\u2019s predictable, has weak character development, awkward moments (especially your assistant \u201cHandler\u201d), and bad lips sync.\n\n[h1]Simple Hunt, Endless Approach [/h1]\nMHW gives you freedom of choice to approach the hunt. You start from basic hunting knowledge as the game constantly introduces new mechanics (tracking, gathering, traps, environmental advantage and much more). Lots of information and UI are thrown into screen, but it\u2019s become handy once you get used to it.\n\nThere are total 14 weapon types (11 melee and 3 ranges). Each weapon has different distinctive move set, combo, weakness, and strengths. It serves purpose and role of combat one way or another, yet allow player to find best weapon to fit their own playstyle. Landing hit always feel satisfied and weight from hard-hitting Greatsword to sky dancing move of Insect Glaive. One thing I would mention is combat in MH series encourages player to master their moves, position, timing, alongside with monster behavior. It\u2019s something you\u2019ve to get used to, as some weapon require higher skill than other, but reward very satisfied outcome. MHW also introduce \u201cslinger\u201d as sidearm, allow you to shoot various bullets type that you collect from environment or monster part. It has grappling hook to traverse faster or reach higher ground to mount the monster. Moreover, you also have \u201cPalico\u201d as cat-like companion to support you in various ways depended on its equipment which you can freely customize.\n\nThe game features five main areas filled with different biomes and settings. From dense ancient forest to beautiful coral highlands, every sub-area is full of details and routes connected each other. You tracking targeted monster by collecting dropped samples to reveal their location and level up research point, allow you to track them more easily. Yet, those research points will be used for various supporting feature such as plant greenhouse, crafting Palico gears, trading random materials, including information of monster. \n\nHunting is MHW very dynamic and fluid. Gameplay also emphasize on environment interaction and vertical combat. Taking advantage of high ground to mount on monster or kick Paratoads to paralyze big monster is always amusing. Sometimes, you encounter random turf war between two or more monsters. Let them fight while you hiding in bush. Breaking monster part for specific loot and capture when target shows sight of weakness for better rewards. All are just a small part of MHW experience. Thanks to very smooth character movement and monster animation alongside with responsive keyboard control (although some default setting need to be tweaked). You can also team up with other 3 players for chaotic fun experience (like launching a friend to make aerial combo using your hammer or gang up monster with trap and barrel bomb) as the monster become tougher and aggressive based on party size.\n\n[h1]Progress, Unlock, Enhance [/h1]\nAfter each quest, you can choose to freely explore in Expedition mode or back to main village \u201cAstera\u201d where it serve as main hub of various side features to upgrade your hunter, crafting, create meal for buff, receive special task, decorate your home with capture small creatures, or meet other players in Gathering hub. Every loot and quest rewards you with new special gadget, gear recipes, and unlockable features makes you\u2019ll feel like constantly improved. The smithy allows you to customize gear, each weapon has different tree build and armor set has its weakness and strength. Yet, you can use mixed skill from armor set, depending on what monster you\u2019re facing as the element damage and ailments do matter on higher rank monsters.\n\nOn a side note, UI and inventory system could be a bit messy and confused for first time, but it major improved game flow once you get used to as player can customize loadout, wishlist, name, guild card, and quick crafting which is very useful during real-time hunting.\n\n[h1]Sound of New World [/h1]\nWhile most of voice acting is decent and lip-sync performance is hit-and-miss, MHW has amazing soundtracks and ambient musics. They're memorable, film symphony orchestra, and motivated during hunt as it play dynamically on certain situation. Most of sound effects are solid. Large monster give you terrified roar and distinctive to define their identity.\n\n[h1]Ending is just The Beginning [/h1]\nMHW still offers more end-game contents after main campaign, introducing Tempered Monsters, extended upgrading features (augment, jewel, limited removal), and more upcoming free contents same as console version. Side optional investigation, arena time attack, or participate event hunts. Moreover, you also unlock special quests on certain hunter rank. At this point, you might ask yourself or set your own goal if you enjoy hunting more hardened monsters over and over for specific upgrade components. You\u2019re grinding for maximize your gear and RNG can be painful or enjoy random hunt for pure fun. The choice is yours and it\u2019s still worth even though you only play main story.\n\n[h1]Stumble in Technical Issues [/h1]\nIt\u2019s first time of MH Team to work in PC port. The performance varies on different builds and drivers. Although I had no crash issue on low-spec PC, the optimization itself is very decent. The some textures are slightly sharpened than console version, there are some blurry textures and overused effect, it also lack graphical option to disable in-game DOF and motion blur. Huge particle effect on some area or specific attack can kill FPS due to poorly optimized MT framework engine and how the game function which impact on CPU usage. Inconsistent network connection can sometimes present in prime time. But Capcom manages to finally resolve critical connection issue which I really appreciated (September patch). At this point, MHW becomes much more stable as the developers deploy patches from time to time.\n\n[h1]Verdict [/h1]\nMHW is designed for specific audience. People who enjoy hunting, collecting, crafting, tracking progression as based formula. High-risk, high-reward combat but improved accessibility in most ways. It\u2019s not perfect, but it\u2019s great way to introduce new comer to the series, but still offer challenge and fun factor to veterans. At this point, it\u2019s best to find out by yourself and I believe MH Team could deliver QOL update and free content for better experience from now on.\n\nI hope you fine this review helpful and enjoy hunting~", "timestamp_created": 1535178303, "timestamp_updated": 1538327204, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 213, "votes_funny": 14, "weighted_vote_score": "0.856543540954589844", "comment_count": 9, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "47699853": {"recommendationid": "47699853", "author": {"steamid": "76561198051399986", "num_games_owned": 198, "num_reviews": 2, "playtime_forever": 12695, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 365, "last_played": 1551208686}, "language": "english", "review": "i bought this game just days before it went on sale. feels bad man\nthat said, monster hunter world is the most fun i have had with a 60 dollar game, in recent memory.\n\na lil background, i played monster hunter freedom 2, then unite, on the psp back in the day. i was looking forward to playing this game for a while, but i was discouraged by the bad reviews when it came to pc. reports of GB bugs, corrupt saves, multiplayer with friends being unplayable. \nmy experience with the game has been smooth af. no bugs.\neven seems like monster ai has been improved alot since i played. i have only seen the monsters acting weird once, maybe twice. although, i was never bothered by that behavior, in fact i think its charming\n\nanyway, yea, if youve got friends who play, consider the purchase. it would be a lot of fun, i bet!\n\nor if you play solo and are having trouble, the game offers ways to reach out for help. maybe you can even make a friend \n:'D", "timestamp_created": 1545464235, "timestamp_updated": 1545464235, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 43, "votes_funny": 2, "weighted_vote_score": "0.688677728176116943", "comment_count": 4, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44025709": {"recommendationid": "44025709", "author": {"steamid": "76561198047859768", "num_games_owned": 211, "num_reviews": 20, "playtime_forever": 7971, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1548642614}, "language": "english", "review": "Fun game you enjoy fighting big monsters or boss like battles, it also has 4 player Coop support\n\nThe first two hours of the game are mostly tutorials and character customization so I would reccomend looking at Youtube reviews so you know what you're geting into.\n\nAlso turn off Volumetric Rendering to significantly boost your FPS if you seem to have trouble running the game.\n\n[Update/Response to current steam reviews]\n\nI see a ton of people negatively reviewing the game on technical issues, acting as if the game is bad or unplayable yet still playing it for several hours.\n\nThere is currently an issue with playing on Mouse and Keyboard because the game emulates a joystick instead of using raw input from your mouse.

Combat is incredibly fluid and heavily centered around performing combos to maximize your damage output. On the surface all looks and behaves well, but the game in general is quite the resource hog (focused on more below). Be that as it may, the game's combat in itself both looks and feels great, and so comes off as a positive point.\n\n+Hunts: This is the main thing you will be doing in the game, and I can happily say that each new creature you hunt is enjoyable, in the sense each hunt feels similar to a boss fight, as it should. Fighting each new creature, figuring out their attack patterns and weaknesses is what makes each new hunt so thrilling, and MHW does just that with this release.\n\n+Graphics: The game looks great, simple as that. Each creature you meet and the expansive environments to travel in are stunning.\n\n+Variety: You have a total of 14 weapon classes to choose from. Each providing their own sets of benefits and demerits, and allowing you to take on different means of approaches for a hunt. These varying classes basically allow at least one fit for any hunter to mesh with their preferred playstyle.\n\n+Cats: Your Palico companion, and chefs, are simply adorable. That's really all I want to say, but your companion in specific is very helpful and still gives you a partner if running solo. Your Palico can assist in a variety of manners be it in damage, defense, or restoration. \n\n[h1] [u]The Bad[/u] [/h1]\n\n-Optimization isn't the best, more modest rigs are going to have a tougher time of running it (my 1080 barely passes 60 fps on high in 1440p, even when out of combat). \nUPDATE: After turning off volumetric rendering for the fog in the advanced settings I'm getting between 90 - 100 fps on high. Hard to say how much of an increase lower end rigs will experience so I'll leave this up as a \"buy with caution\" point.\nUPDATE 2: According to hardware monitor my i7 8700k almost reached 100 degrees celcius, this is NOT okay. Yes the game is more cpu intensive, but to the extent that my hardware is well past the threshold any CPU should reasonably take shows that the game is more poorly optimized than initially thought.\n\n-Denuvo: people seem to be experiencing a lot of issues and from what I'm seeing it seems mostly due to the anti tamper denuvo in the game. If it's as bad as it seems, you may want to make sure your computer is compatible which, if it isn't, will suck for more than a few I'm sure (knew there was denuvo but didn't interfere with my experience, guess I was lucky). \n\n-Online: It's only kinda functional, at first playing with my friend was a bit confusing due to how lobbies worked but after figuring it out we got to hunt together, BUT we have experienced connectivity issues in the game and randomly disconnected from one another. As we were continuously communicating through discord, it's evident that this isn't an issue with our actual connection to our internet.\n\n-Controls: I've personally opted to use a controller from the start, and have no real complaints about the controls. But experimentation with the KB+M felt very off. The mouse in particular behaves like a joystick rather than a mouse for aiming with the cursor, and causes for some incredibly awkward movements. There doesn't seem to be any way around this either. I'd recommend a controller if possible for other buyers, but this will come as a bummer to many if not (unless this is later fixed of course).\n\n[h1][u]Conclusion:[/u][/h1]\n\nMy first real Monster Hunter game in the series and I love it, recommended to all, newcomers and veterans alike. Will update more if need be as I play through the PC version.\n\nAdditional info: After playing through the game a bit more, more issues have sprouted up. The game works and I am indeed enjoying it, but there are many who are going through worse due to these stated issues. As such, I advise caution to purchasing this game immediately, it may be best to bide your time and see how the game is patched.\n\n[quote][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/7871885/]Follow our curator page,[b] OCG-Curations[/b] if you like and want to see more reviews like this one.[/url][/quote]", "timestamp_created": 1533832584, "timestamp_updated": 1534059922, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 389, "votes_funny": 22, "weighted_vote_score": "0.808582544326782227", "comment_count": 31, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44180998": {"recommendationid": "44180998", "author": {"steamid": "76561198139225985", "num_games_owned": 326, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 3210, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1534399315}, "language": "english", "review": "I highly recommend THE GAME in general, but I do not recommend buying it here just yet.

I've clocked 95 hours over six days and I wholeheartedly think this is a wonderful game to experience even with all of the problems. I'll write this review mostly in the context of players that did not play the PS4 version, and I will treat this mostly as a game for newer players that are unsure about buying this game. Bear in mind that Capcom has done a messy job with the port as a whole, but the game itself is a masterful experience. \n\nThe Pros: \n-Monster hunting is amazing. You legitimately have to think your way through as you progress through the game. \n-14 choosable weapons, and every weapon is viable for the most part to progress through the story. Some weapons naturally have an advantage over certain mobs over others.\n-Progression is wonderful, and there are trees to each weapon that you can pick. Some weapons are unique and customizable. \n-Beat monster, then use monster bones to fight bigger monster. That's the joy of monster hunter! \n-Solo gameplay is amazing, and in my opinion the way to experience MH the first time, especially when youre facing new monsters. \n-Very detailed world design, 5 unique areas each sporting unique monsters to hunt.\n-Diverse skills that each armor sports, making proper builds an actual thing. Build does matter, and will increase your damage!\n-T-Rex that breathes fire\n\nThe Meh: \n-Story is interesting to some extent, but hard to really get invested in.\n-Characters are unnamed. They're literally called \"Handler\" and the like. \n-No glamour/transmog system, so you can't cover an ugly looking armor that might be good for your build.\n-Lack of content after completing your own goals, and not currently caught up with PS4. \n-Iffy control schemes, simpler weapons like the Bow won't mind it at all, but weapons with more button presses will want a controller. \n\nThe Cons:\n-Multiplayer is BROKEN for most people.  D/C from my own session even though I'm in Discord fine! \n-The game is not very well optimized, a few particle heavy bosses in the very endgame will absolutely tank your fps, even my friends with good rigs have complained about it.\n-The game renders entire maps together, so some of the worlds you'll experience worse performance because of size and complexity. \n-Denuvo\n\nIs this game worth $60 to you?

It fights with you in duos/solos if you allow them.\n- Cats have armour and weapons.\n\nCons : \n- There are bad players, beware. (reviews about how the monster 'predicts' your attacks)\n- There are bad players hoping you can wail on monsters just because you dodged.\n- Some of these players did not just give up and are still playing, BEWARE.\n- This game is not for potato PCs. Seriously.\n- Low settings can take awhile to get used to. \n(still looks alright to me,  but it is a bit of a downgrade from high/medium)\n- The AI is pretty scary if you're not prepared. \n(If you want a punishing beat-em-up, go to Dark Souls, instead.)\n- There is a long grind. It's what this game is about. \nGrind for parts, make stuff to grind for more parts.\n- Disconnection issues may have been improved upon, but are still there. \n(possibly caused by Steam, rather than MHW?)\n- Again, this game is *seriously* taxing on one's system.

Multiplayer is dealing with a harder AI to read and way more HP to break through with reliance on teammates who may or may not be good.\n- This is not a game for people who believe that if you outplay the monster by dodging, you get free hits.

The Graphics are not the best, but amazing enough to give you this experience that you are walking on a living breathing land. Talking about living and breathing, the monsters are absolutely spectacular, this game has you thinking, calculating and observing what the monster does next and countering it with your own attacks, The designs are well done and amazing and the cutscenes perfectly reflect their role and power in the region they thrive and live in.\n\nThe regions are extremely well done and the monsters that live in their respective regions make sense as to why they live in those places. My personal favorite Region is the Coral Highlands, the fact that Highlands are sustained by the life energy of monsters that die in the Rotten Vale gives me this feeling that i am walking over a land that is ACTUALLY living!\n\nThe Story of MHW wasn't a top for me even though i am one massive lore nerd as it was pretty blank in concept, the story missions were basically the same thing copy-pasted with a different monster.

Despite this game being more user friendly, it's still incredibly cryptic and you won't get far without doing some research on your own. The game doesn't do the best job of explaining itself to say the least. Also, the multiplayer menus take a minute to get used to. The process of figuring out how to get multiplayer to function the way I wanted it to was pretty annoying.\n\nNow that my gripes are out of the way, this is one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics are beautiful. Sound effects and soundtrack are fantastic. And most importantly, the gameplay is superb. A perfect balance of grind and reward. It doesn't take long before you're wearing some awesome looking armor and feel somewhat powerful with your weapon of choice.\n\nThat being said, this game isn't easy. Not only is every weapon super unique and have different purposes, but you need to be very good with at least two or three of them to get by. Learning the combos and proper technique takes a bit of research, unless you go with the dual blades or sword and shield builds. The boss fights are incredibly difficult, rivaling Dark Souls and similar style games in difficulty.

I really hope Capcom will still fix it ASAP despite my positive feedback.\n\nWhat I enjoy from Monster Hunter World despite this is my first game of the franchise are :\n\n- Good difficulty progression, at first you will meet normal-hard version of the monster then harder version then hardest version of the monster. All in good step progression.\n\n- A lot of things to do, not counting the grind for the end game which really optional. There are alot of things to try, whether you want to collect all armor, trying all weapon, collect all palico's gadget.\n\n- Co-op is really optional. As for me I always try everything solo first because of the challenge then after If I want to co-op I can hunt with  my friend or just use \"SOS\" feature to help random people\n\n- Good for Casual player and Hardcore player. Casual can just play the game as it is until reach tempered version of monster, both solo and co-op. Hardcore can aim for min-maxing the equipment through endgame. It's really up to you.\n\n- Endgame Grinding is optional. Unlike MMO which something you need to do if you don't want lag behind. As for me once I beat all monster solo until tempered elder dragon I feel satisfied enough. I don't really attracted enough to find all decorations and augment to complete my gear set. I'm still gonna continue tho to try other weapon, but probably not as intense as usually I play.\n\n\nWhat I dissapointed from the game :\n\n- Lack of Raw Mouse Input. This is the only reason I don't try range weapon. I don't like playing range using controller, but when I try using K+M the mouse really feel weird. Alot of suggestion how to tweak but I really can't get it enjoyable. Capcom really need to fix this.\n\n- Texture bug. My rig is not the best, but for texture I usually can get the highest option. Despite that it's still not look too good\n\n- Network Issue. This is the only reason preventing people playing co-op and why it's worth to give negative feedback for this game. \n\n- Not enough explanation for some feature in the game unless console player told us. Yes I'm talking about radial menu customization\n\n\nMixed feeling :\n\n- Amount of Monster, I feel it's good enough but after I read some of comment about number of monster in previous game I feel like MHW can get more too.

It is a pretty game.  It's definitely a game for people with more powerful rigs.  If you have never played a Monster Hunter game in your life before, this is superb.  Even if you've played Monster Hunter games before and want to get back into the franchise, this game reinvents and does away with many annoying mechanics.  No more paintballs and no more loading into 12 different zones.  That's always nice.\n\nSo, why is this game mixed?  Somewhat simple.  People don't understand how games these days work.\nHere's the lowdown on the mixed review.\nWhen the game launched on PC, it was met with a very unforgiving issue:  Multiplayer only worked when it wanted to at best.  You could never start this game with the expectation that you'd be playing with your friends.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  We had to try dozens of placebo fixes in the remote hope of ever possibly playing with our friends.\nToday, August 22, about two weeks post PC launch, this issue was patched.\nNow, instead of people changing their minds about this, they're angry it took two weeks.  I work quality assurance for a small company and I inspect developer work.  It is not unusual for something to take a full week to pass QA sometimes.  There is a lot of testing that has to go on and be reproduced that often goes underappreciated.  People are so used to day one patches that they don't realize that day one patches or patches that soon follow a product release are often things that have been caught by QA/Dev prior to launch and have been worked on before it actually hit.\nWhat I suspect happened with the connection issue is that it honestly went unnoticed until launch.  Granted, that's a pretty big problem to have go unnoticed, but sometimes things go through to production that maybe shouldn't.  Bugs happen.  It takes time to fix these bugs.  Two weeks isn't unreasonable for what seems to be a beguiling intermittent bug that can be observed, yet not reliably reproduced.  Even the large userbase of players that were so disgruntled couldn't find an extremely reliable way of reproducing it other than \"It just happens\" and \"I can't connect at all.\"  Things like this can take a lot of work to try to figure out the underlying cause.  It's just a nice thing to have watched the SteamDB page show that their dev repositories were constantly being updated -- they were actively working on fixing it for the whole two weeks, not sitting around with their thumbs up their rectums.\n\nNow, two weeks post launch.  Connection issue is fixed for the most part.  According to the devs, it's still occuring in some cases, but their fixes have reduced the frequency of it.  Chances are you won't see the effects of this review bomb go away, which is unfortunate.  Without this connection issue, I could see this game being at least in Very Positive territory.  Only very positive because there are still outstanding issues with the game's graphical issues.\n\nOne thing you need to be very aware of is that Monster Hunter is a pretty game.  Many pretty games aren't very well optimized to run on all hardware.  This is very much the case with Monster Hunter.  Do your homework and look for the minimum spec, because this game is about as hard on your computer as an Ubisoft title.  Lots of horsepower is required to get this game running nice and pretty, but I've made it work on three different computers.  One with a 1050Ti and an i7-3770K; one with an i7-7700HQ and a 1070; and one with a Ryzen 1700X and a 1080.  The 1050 Ti needed to be put to low graphics settings at 1920x1080 to achieve a good, playable framerate, but I don't think it could manage a silky smooth 60 fps.  The 1070 machine can run the game beautifully at high settings with no real issues.  Perfect smoothness on the i7-7700HQ/1070 build was achieved by turning volumetric fog to low or none.  Finally, the Ryzen 1700X/1080 build managed just fine on max settings, though volumetric fog was turned down to help assist in certain frame spiking situations.\n\nWith that said, your biggest enemy to performance will be the volumetric fog effect.  It looks pretty if that's what you're used to, but turn it to low if you want to keep it.  The difference is minimal, visually, but the FPS impact is very significant.  Turn if off if you don't like fog in the distance.\nNow, the last performance hitch of note is the lightning effects.  Heavy lightning effects occurring on screen, especially from player-based attacks, tend to drop frames for no understandable reason.  Avoid having more than 2 people in your party using lightning-based weaponry, or you'll start to get into unplayable framerate territory.  I have faith this issue will be patched in time, but as of the time of writing this on August 22, it's still ongoing.\n\nFinally, one last major gripe I'm sure you're going to see coming out of the bag of negative reviews is that the game uses Denuvo.  You'll hear all sorts of horror stories about it destroying solid state drives and killing your CPU performance.  It does no such thing, and such claims are unsubstantiated.  I will agree to the sentiment that most games I've played that run Denuvo DRM tend to hurt on the CPU performance side.  You will find that people have articles up about how Denuvo tanks performance, but you often find rebuttals about it.\nPoint is, Denuvo sucks.  Maybe in a decade it could lock you out of the game if it goes under or support drops or whatever.  The bottom line is this:  You will not be playing Monster Hunter World in 10 years.  You just won't.  Games For Windows Live was dropped a long time ago, and some computer games 10 years back were still using it.  When is the last time you touched a GFWL game?  Very likely you haven't in the past few years.  Stop worrying about Denuvo maybe someday making this game unplayable.  When that happens, you'll have long moved on from this game.\n---\n\nWould that I had more space to write about the actual game, because there's a lot ado about this game.  Check the positive comments that offer proper reviews on what the game is made of.  Monster Hunter titles are exceptional fun.  I wrote a few paragraphs in this review before being interrupted by the character limit here.\n\nTo sum things up, Monster Hunter games are about bringing low very big and powerful monsters.  To help with this, you have a very wide and fun arsenal of weapons and hunter tools to go about this job.  You must track monsters, find these monsters, then target their weak points while addressing shortcomings of your own, such as elemental resistances, to take them out.  There is a wide variety of them to hunt and it is difficult to get bored in this game.\n\nIf you've played other Monster Hunter titles in the past, this game is more streamlined than its predecessors.  No more paintballs, no more zoning in to a dozen different spots.  It's all interconnected.  You have scout flies that loosely guide you to your hunt mark.  There is a shorter list of monsters in this title compared to others, but QoL improvements here make the game worth it.\n\nIf you have any pressing questions, feel free to comment on the review and we can chat.", "timestamp_created": 1535002109, "timestamp_updated": 1535003630, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 186, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.717960536479949951", "comment_count": 23, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "44057070": {"recommendationid": "44057070", "author": {"steamid": "76561198025231739", "num_games_owned": 781, "num_reviews": 54, "playtime_forever": 8081, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1549331600}, "language": "english", "review": "despite all the problems, all i just wanna do is hunt down monsters solo or with friends.

You can run while using items, (cept for traps ofc) which is a HUGE help considering that a big-ass monster is always after you. Crafting is a breeze since you can automatically have things crafted as you gather mats. Gathering is also easier since you can just spam the gather button while passing by resources (although there are special nodes that could be mined a lot that requires you to stop).\n\nThe servers aren't stable yet, but once it is, this would be a pretty fun game for enthusiasts and newbies alike. Just a friendly reminder, though, this game isn't easy. Don't expect it to hold your hand and the monsters could one shot you if you don't know how to dodge/block. To quote a comment I read today, this game isn't for people who think they are Rambo.

On PC.\n+Great animations and visuals in general. \n+Weapons seem to be well balanced in comparison to prior titles.\n+Less tedium. Especially when gathering.\n+No loading times between map areas (about time)\n+Highly customizable loadouts, item belt settings, etc.\n+Good tutorials. Nice for beginners.\n+Combat is tons of fun. Albeit a bit crazy sometimes.\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n-Menu navigation, Just awful. Much more awful than in previous titles. I am especially triggered by the book animation that is played when browsing quests EVERY SINGLE TIME. (I know about the speed up)\n-Lack of graphical options. Motion blur and DoF need to be optional.\n- No option to disable the annoying af scout flies. I am not blind nor stupid. I can find gathering spots without it. Please don't clutter my screen.\n-Hilariously bad optimization. Srsly, considering the looks of the game, it runs like garbage. Get 2+ ppl with elemental weapons and watch any NASA PC spew out 30 fps on average during combat. No matter the settings. It's unforgiveable for a multiplayer game.\n-Speaking of which, reduce the special effects and particles in combat situations. Spares my eyes and boosts fps. ez win/win.\n-Everything about the multiplayer. Getting a group on a PSP using x-link kai was more straightforward. This is a ~cOnNecTeD eXpErIenCe~ I never imagined to feel this lonely in. It's impossible to get a pub group going. Everyone just  SOS flares and then disbands because it's the only half decent way to get multiplayer. I really miss setting up a room and taking turns with ppl picking quests.\n-Chat system. Why is it so hard to access? Why are NPC dialogues, progress notifications and other junk displayed in the same screen area? Let me press \"y\" and fucking chat. I don't want to navigate through 3 menues to say something. \n-Can't see hunters in headquarters. And nobody is in the gathering hall. Ever.\n-Network errors are far too common.\n-Where are the 200k ppl playing? I never see more than ~20 lobbies (with mostly 1-2 player in each) REGARDLESS OF THE FILTER SETTINGS. WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE?????\n-Unskippable cutscences. Spare me those. I know how to play MH.\n-Too easy, aka where is my fucking G-Rank?. I roll everything solo with the iron tree weapons and don't even care about the skills.\n-Sound system. Maybe it's me, but after trying several ingame settings, everything sounds muddy and indistinctive in my DT770's.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\nThere is so much more I'd like to add but chances are, nobody reads it ayways. So a few last sentences:\nI am pretty disillusioned. What they did for 6 months porting the game is inexplicable to me. It can't be (performance) optimization for PC, that's for sure. The antiquated UI and menus are impractical and tedious to navigate. You need strong willpower to explore the many options given. \nAbandon all hope at CAPCOM fixing anything. That would be foolish to assume given their track record. \n\nFor diehard MH fans a must buy. For everyone else, not so much. The game gets bad reviews for a reason.\n----------------------------Edit-----------------------------\nI hope you guys can understand what It takes to leave a negative review for this game. As someone who waited for the pc version for literally 10 years. Because from the very beginning I was convinced that playing on 400 x 240 pixels screen with 30 fps doesn't do this gorgeous game justice. \nAnd when it finally happened, even though I love the franchise to death, I cannot turn a blind eye to the many issues it has.\nSure some of them are nitpicked. But it adds up.

Just because you paid for it, you think you can play it anytime you want ? No. You can play it whenever WE want. And if we're feeling good, we might even let you go on a quest with your friends. Maybe. We might change our opinion and kick you out in the middle of the quest though. \n\nOh ? You have a perfectly good OC'd CPU ? Yeah, no. I won't let you launch it. It's a 3 years old CPU, you better upgrade. Why ? Well those good folks at Denuvo gave us amazing BJ's so we'll go with them instead of doing what our customers want. If you don't like it, don't play it. Whoops I forgot, you can't play it anyway.\n\nWe might fix the servers sometime, maybe next month. But Denuvo is here to stay, f\u00a8k you and your opinion. We paid like 300.000\u20ac from our server budget to Denuvo, it'll surely drop the piracy and generate us even more income !\n\nOh and we heard someone asking for PC related options like motion blur and depth of field. Honestly, adding 3 lines of codes is just too much work. we might do it later. Next month maybe.\n\n[url=https://steamcommunity.com/groups/mohunka]MHW Group[/url]\n\nEDIT: They've pretty much fixed everything I talked about in this review.
