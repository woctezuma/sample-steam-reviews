The difference between these planets is the time required to max out everything, mars is the fastest, earth is the slowest and moon is between the two.\n\nPlus, there is some kind of mechanism, which you won't use in the begining, but after that, you will easily finish every planet and event.\n\nIf you're looking for a really action-packed game, or which has a really good story, gameplay or whatever, this is definetly not your game.

It actually gives you money even when you are offline, but its nice to have it running so you can upgrade as soon as possible.\n\nThis game is actually pretty flat. It doesnt give you much cool stuff, its always just a new grind to yet another unlock. Everytime you level up something it always doubles the amount of cash gain. It's still very addictive for some strange reason. I guess its because people in general just love unlocks and progression in a game, even if it doesnt do much.\n\nThis is a free to play game, but doesnt force you to buy anything really. You can buy some things for real money if you wish, but I dont see a reason for doing so, unless you want some cosmetic things. Just let the game play itself and you will have lots of money to spend on new upgrades. \n\nThis looks like it could be a mobile game, but it does not have any microtransation problem as these kinds of games on appstore normally have. Options are good and you can play in window mode with a lot of different resolution options. This game should be possible to run on most computers, and steam cloud is available, which I always appreciate since I own more then one gaming computer.\n\nIts a good game for being free.

I'll give a quick breakdown:\n\nPros:\n\n*Completely free to play incremental game. It does have store purchases that you can buy with real money, but they aren't necessary for enjoying the game. I did spend some money on the Kongregate version, to buy cash multipliers, but that was months after I started playing the game, and it was just to support Hyper Hippo.\n\n*Progression is very linear. The game is simple to learn, and once you start you'll find yourself advancing rather quickly. \n\n*Reset bonuses. This has basically become a must for all incremental games, and AdCap does it very well. You get \"Angel Investors\" every time you reset (after you've earned some that is), and they add bonuses to your cash income. You can also spend them like cash to unlock upgrades to further increase your cash income and multipliers. Be warned that you can spend all of your angels, and lose the bonus they provide!\n\n*Extremely long lasting gameplay. You'll be playing this game for months, even if you play every single day as I did when I started playing. You can play actively or afk, and you'll still progress rather evenly, and it's a lot of fun. I've gotten to \"end-game\", so I usually check in every few days, do a reset, then get back up to where I was. \n\n*Constant updates. They had a really dry period a few months ago where we didn't see any new updates, but they've gotten back to making more. They just released a complete \"expansion\" on the Kongregate version, which is in the early stages and will be seeing more content in the future. They're still not done updating the main version though, so there's a lot more content to come. \n\n*Offline progress. Pretty straight forward, but some incremental don't have this, so it's worth listing. \n\nCons:\n\n*The music will drive you insane, I guarantee it. Click the dude's face in the upper left corner to find the mute button.\n\n*Not much to do once you hit endgame. It'll take an extremely long time to get there, but as I listed in the pros, at the point I'm at, I just log in once every few days, or once a week, and do a reset. It takes maybe 30 seconds to buy all the buildings and get back to where I was. However, this is just being picky for cons, because they do roll out updates to add more progression to endgame. \n\nSo yea, I'm rather surprised that this game is on steam, but if you're thinking about playing it, you basically have no reason not to. It's one of the best incremental games I've ever played, and if you like these kinds of things, you'll be playing it for a very long time. Plus, you can run it in windowed, so you can do other stuff and have it running. \n\n10/10", "timestamp_created": 1427734702, "timestamp_updated": 1427734702, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 227, "votes_funny": 19, "weighted_vote_score": "0.881926476955413818", "comment_count": 6, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "35051927": {"recommendationid": "35051927", "author": {"steamid": "76561198355036865", "num_games_owned": 111, "num_reviews": 41, "playtime_forever": 29628, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1505760170}, "language": "english", "review": "Pay to Win Changes.  Microtransaction Greedy Company.  Ruined a Good Game.\nThe game has changed a lot.  When I started playing it I would have highly recommended it.  Not anymore.  The company is completely obsessed with getting money through microtransactions.  The entire game changed to maximize the microtransactions.  Unless you want to pay oodles of money, stay away.  I'll discuss it further if you'd like to understand better before getting involved.\n\nGame play:\nThe actual game is fun as an idle clicker.  There are three different investment paths you could play as well as live events with badge rewards for completing them.  There are slow periods and it can take a while to finish if you aren't that active with the game. \n\nHere's where it went wrong:\nThey changed the live events to be competitive with leader boards and offer \"rewards\" to the top players.  This has changed everything.  Even if you try to ignore the live events your main game now suffers dramatically.  The only way to make you play better in a live event is to buy different types of boosts with gold.  Gold is/was given through regular game play.  Most importantly, you can buy gold with cash (the microtransactions).  If you can't see how this is going... keep reading.\n\nChanges:\nYou once got daily rewards for logging in that gave you a very small amount of the in game currency (gold or mega bucks).  This was to make up for the Kongragate users getting these free for watching ads.  They've removed the feature in steam (without warning anyone) because they no longer want to give you gold as they want you to buy it instead.  Remember, gold is used in buying boosts in the game and most notably the live events for competition.\n\nWhen you complete your main game path (Earth) which can take from 4 months of constant playing to years of casual playing, you are given a gold reward once if you reset Earth and started all over from scratch.  The reward was 5,000 gold.  I, along with so many others, got this reward.  Suddenly, without warning, this was change to 500 gold.  They claim that the 5k was just too much gold and people could compete unfairly in the live events.  This is actually inaccurate, as I'll explain later.\n\nLive events have changed as well.  When I started playing they lasted a week and you could complete the event without using gold as long as you did tend to the management in a somewhat timely basis.  Some of them were fun and required strategy.  They were held about once a month around holidays or the like.  When they started adding the leader board stuff they began playing the events almost constantly and replaying recent events.  They also started making them shorter so you absolutely had to spend gold to finish them.  They were ramming then down our throats trying to get those microtransactions.  \n\nLeader boards are a joke.  I had the 5k gold, finished all aspects of the game several times over again, so I could spend the gold on the events.  Spending 100 gold and sitting there constantly playing for the entire time would mean I would rank around the 2k mark.  You actually had to be active for about 24 hours a day to keep up with the game to hold on to the 1k position.  I forgot about the game for half a day and dropped to 6k rank.  One of the reduced time events I decided to dump a couple hundred gold to see how it would go, 1k with playing constantly.  In order to place in the top 100 you would have to spend all 5k free gold and monitor the game straight without take sleep breaks and then you still might not be able to do it.  500 gold reward from completing Earth is a slap in the face if 5k won't cut it.\n\nThere's rampant cheating in the leader boards.  There is no way anyone can legitimately compete.  From using autoclickers to apparently (it's been written about but I don't know) tweaking the time on your computer you can fool with the system there is unfairness in the leader boards.  There's other things that cause you to wonder about the legitimacy of it like the names on the leader boards are highly suspicious, when you should get a big boost on the leader board but stay in the exact same rank, or when the game just starts and the top ranked has so much that it would be impossible to get.\n\nWhy it matters to the casual player:\nYou cannot actually compete in the events and will struggle more to complete the regular games.  They made it even harder for those who just want to relax with the game with their gold changes.  You are forced to spend gold on live events now to finish them.  However, they have cut the gold you can get through playing the game.  It makes it so much harder for the new casual player to get anywhere.  Live events give badges with the last badge for finishing the event being a multiplier for the regular game.  You need to collect the badges to help your normal game progression.  If you can't complete the live event your game suffers.  \n\nGold is used in the regular games for boosts that dramatically help your game progression.  Having the daily rewards removed means you can no longer help your game along.  You will get a bit of gold through playing, but you now have to save that for the events that have the badges that you need.

[/h1]\n\n[b] Who am I:[/b]\n\nHi there! My name is Claire, I am 26 years old and from Denmark. I have over 20 years of gaming experience. I do all achievements for the game before I review it. So my review truly reflects a 100% completion of the game.\nHowever it is still my subjective opinion of the game, so take everything I say with a grain of salt. Hope you enjoy!\n\n[b]Gameplay:[/b]\n\nAdventure Capitalist is a very simple game. You start off on Earth with nothing but a measly lemon stand that earns you a couple bucks every time you click on it. As you click on it, you gain more and more money. This money allows you to buy the next source of income, which is a newspaper stand. You then start clicking on that aswell, until you unlock the next source of income. You get the picture.\n\nAs you unlock more and more sources of income, you also unlock managers. These managers enable your sources of income to be automatic, so you don't have to click on them anylonger.\n\nAs you earn more and more money, you start accumulating Angels. Angels serve the most pivotal mechanic in Adventure Capitalist. Every Angel increases your income by 2% (with upgrades, even more so), but in order to activate your Angels, you will have to start all over from scratch. Restarting might sound like a bad idea at first, but the angels allows you to accumulate more and more income over time. \n\nOnce you get into the game you will be restarting A LOT to keep progressing at a decent pace. The game becomes much more about restarting at efficient timings, than being an actual clicking game.\n\nAs you get further into the game you will unlock both the Moon and Mars. The Moon and Mars are seperate economies which work quite differently to Earth. These serve as a decent distraction from Earth, and while Mars didn't take me very long to max out, The Moon was actually longer to complete than Earth was.\n\n[b]Story:[/b]\n\nYou play as a greedy capitalist, male or female, out to conquer the entire world! \nOkay, it's a free clicking game guys, there's not going to be a deep story here.\n\n[b]Graphics:[/b]\n\nIt's basically just an interface with buttons to click on. Comparing it to something like Clicker Heroes, which is also free, Adventure Capitalist is not as interesting or nice to look at. \n\nThere's basically not much going on graphically in this game.\n\nThe Moon, Mars, Earth and the occasional event has different styles to their menus, but that's about all you get for variety graphically in Adventure Capitalist.\n\n[b]Sound:[/b]\n\nThere's a different song looping on every planet. It gets very annoying and very monotonus quickly. I turned it off after about 5 minutes.\n\nThe songs are however light-heartedly themed, and very self-aware in the sense that it's almost ironic listening to these very happy tunes, as you're raking in fantastical amounts of money. \n\nSeeing as the game is very simple, I find that game would've been better off with no music and a bigger emphasis on making the actual game menus more attractive and interactive. \n\n[b]Price:[/b]\n\nYou can play the game from start to finish without spending a single penny. The game has an option to let you spend real money on the ingame currency: Goldbars.\n\nThe Goldbars allows you to buy multipliers, flux capacitors, time skippers and gear for your \"character\".\nIt basically makes you complete the game more quickly, or makes you get past wait times.\n\nI personally spent 10 dollars on the game, mainly to support the game, but also so I could test out the shop for you guys!\n\nIt's important to notice that the game gives you daily rewards and milestone rewards in the form of gold bars, so even if you decide not to spend any money on the game, you can still get everything if you're patient.\n\n[b]Conclusion:[/b]\n\nAdventure Capitalist is a very simple clicking game with very few mechanics. You buy sources of income, you buy upgrades, you buy managers, you wait... You use your angels to reset and you do it all over, this time even quicker than the last. The game is undeniably very monotonous and simple.\n\nWith that said, I find myself with almost 100 hours played before I finished all the achievements and planets, and I can honestly say I didn't find it boring. Seeing yourself go from 1 buck to absolutely enormous amounts of money is quite addictive. The fact that you have both Mars and The Moon as little side economies helps aswell.\n\nUltimately, Adventure Capitalist is free and it can be played on a potato, so it makes for a good game to play when you just want to chill out, and I think that is the fundamental nature of clicking games. \n\nI give Adventure Capitalist: 8 out of 10.\n\nIf you enjoy my reviews please thumb up the review - and you're always welcome to add me here on steam :-)", "timestamp_created": 1494453778, "timestamp_updated": 1494454759, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 69, "votes_funny": 4, "weighted_vote_score": "0.846471905708312988", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15128069": {"recommendationid": "15128069", "author": {"steamid": "76561198037615099", "num_games_owned": 341, "num_reviews": 30, "playtime_forever": 160, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1462309147}, "language": "english", "review": "\"Honey!

Sure why not; I review everything else on Steam, lets get into it. As with most games like this, there are plenty of unfunny joke reviews that will fill up the front store page for this game so I'm hoping to beat the trend and give some points about the game.\n\nFirst of all, Adventure Capitalist is a game, about, well capitalism. You are an investor setting out to make your fortune.  This game is very similar to the likes of Cookie Clicker, which first came to fame in 2010, is still a mega popular game today. You start off buying lemonade stands, each click on the lemonade stand generates money, with that money buy another stand, so on and so on. Eventually you have enough money to hire a manager for your lemonade stand. The manager acts as the clicker, so you can leave the game running (or close it down) and you will still generate money. You then work up to other investments following the same pattern, and no sooner have you started, you will soon be a millionaire.  With your millions you can also purchase upgrades to your investments, such as increasing profit by 3% or something similar. \n\nThis is where AC is different to other clicker games, you no longer actually need to spam click in order to make progress, since you have your managers working over time for you. What I really like about AC is that you can close the game down, and you will still be generating money, meaning you can let your funds mount up for a couple of days, log back in, spend it all, and watch your money roll in for a bit, then log out.  \n\nThe UI is so brilliantly displayed, you can work your way around all the menus with ease, and you can find all of the information you could ever need either on the main screen or within 2 clicks.  Be warned, this game not only has highly addictive gameplay, the soundtrack is almost just as addictive. Once that song gets in your head, it just will not leave. \n\nAC is not hard at all, it just seems to be a time-sink, and one that keeps you logging back in on a daily basis. You can see just by the amount of hours I have in this game already just how easy it is to loose yourself in a really simple game. I would say I am not in the game for longer than 15 minutes on a daily basis, but it does keep bringing you back just so you can see what made up number of money you have made over night. \n\nThe developers are always adding new content to this game as well; recently there was an update which allows you to continue making your fortunes on the moon! This runs along side your regular empire back on earth, meaning twice as many investments to manage and oggle at crazy sums of money. \n\nGiven that AC is a free to play game, you have no harm in trying it out. I would say that even if you just load it up every couple of days to check it out, you will still get a lot of enjoyment out of it. There is also an iOS version of the game, but unfortunately it does not link up with your game on Steam; that would of been just too good if it did. Maybe it's a potential possibility in the future. \n\nI really strongly recommend AdVenture Capitalist; its a simple, yet horribly addictive game, that allows you to pop in and hour of the game with ease for ten minutes at a time.

Hyper Hippo - on the other hand - decide to make their game, Adventure Capitalist, nearly impossible to beat unless you either spend a horrendous amount of money or alternatively wait literally thousands of years (DiMono, 2015). \n\nThis game is free, mildly addicting and fun to SOME extent.

Adventure Capitalist allows players to live like a capitalist, and invest funds into certain products to generate revenue, by starting out with a single lemonade stand. The more revenue generated, the higher the player's cash is. A player can receive an angel bonus when resetting their progress, which provides a boost in all products' revenue for the next progress timeline. A spin-off, AdVenture Communist, was released on Steam on May 2016. It is also made by Hyper Hippo, and is currently in open beta.\n\nThere are three areas: Earth, Moon, and Mars. The player starts out on Earth. You start with a single investment: a lemonade stand. Tapping it gives you money overtime. When you earn enough money, you can buy another stand, or a different investment at the cost of more time until the payout. Once the player has purchased the manager for said investment, it will run automatically, which means you can successfully idle, even offline. Upgrades can be spent to add multipliers to any investment.\n\nWhen the player reaches 1 trillion dollars on Earth, they can start investing in an area. Once invested, said area will unlock in 200 hours, but can be sped up using video advertisements, angel investors/mega bucks, or gold. Gold can be bought via in-app purchase with real money, and can be used for things such as a non-reset way to gain angel investors, instantly earn money for a day's worth of idling, and more. Mega Bucks are bought starting at 1 decillion of an area's currency, and will be multiplied every time by a fixed increment (the game describes this as 'inflation'). When one player has at least 10 Mega Bucks, they can purchase a golden ticket, which when used on a single investment boosts its profits permanently by \u00d77.77. After one has boosted a whole planet, they will gain an additional \u00d710 boost, which adds (not multiplied) to \u00d717.77 multiplier. This multiplier can be upgraded using Mega Bucks.\n\nSince October 2015, players can also play a limited time special event, which usually are around holidays and other annual events, such as Halloween or Black Friday, and occur once every month for several days. These events are like the three main areas, but are only available during that correlated event. If a player reaches at least one of the objectives of that event, they will get a badge shown in the 'Swag & Stats' page. As the player progresses in some events, they may acquire free gold or Mega Bucks based on unlocks, and even a special badge that when equipped can provide investment specific boosts.\n\nSince The Love of Money event update, the 'Swag&Stats' section is now renamed 'Career', with a revamped stats page, support, swag, and news section. Along with this, there now is an option to make your capitalist a female. The Adventure Capitalist update notes for 4.2 state the monthly events will re-occur, with the same past events being in random(?) months of the year. (Specifically, The Love of Money event will reoccur in October, with more gold and Mega Buck rewards for unlocks.)", "timestamp_created": 1477101086, "timestamp_updated": 1477101150, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 33, "votes_funny": 20, "weighted_vote_score": "0.779477477073669434", "comment_count": 0, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "15395469": {"recommendationid": "15395469", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042343035", "num_games_owned": 98, "num_reviews": 6, "playtime_forever": 147, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1429419030}, "language": "english", "review": "Y'know, I could solve world hunger, give cancer research more money than it would ever need, single-handedly fix the European and American debt crises, but instead, I'm gonna buy another one hundred and thirty-three shrimp boats.", "timestamp_created": 1429154973, "timestamp_updated": 1429155161, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 337, "votes_funny": 846, "weighted_vote_score": "0.864035844802856445", "comment_count": 8, "steam_purchase": false, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "21123153": {"recommendationid": "21123153", "author": {"steamid": "76561198042666225", "num_games_owned": 5146, "num_reviews": 44, "playtime_forever": 41807, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1524732492}, "language": "english", "review": "As much as i love the game i have to change my vote from positive to negative.

So It may be possible that the game has changed now, and some information in this review is now false. I'm not going to bother checking at this point because I still think the game is slow and boring and made solely to leech off people who get addicted and want to buy content instead of waiting a whole year to progress. But at least it's possible at this point. The original review follows (sorry for the escape characters; Steam added them on its own and I don't care to fix them at this point):\n\nThis game is a scam. I\\'m sad to say this because I did enjoy the game for a while. But I think like many people, I played the game for a long time before realizing that eventually you get to a point in which progressing is literally impossible.\n\nI don\\'t mean that progressing gets tedious and you\\'re pretty much forced to choose between paying money for the game or doing something incredibly dull for a long time to feel like you didn\\'t waste your effort getting to that point.\n\nI mean that the game becomes literally unwinnable. You can\\'t get all the achievements or in-game collectibles/purchases. Even if you pay real money on the game. Even if you spent over $1000 of the game, you will become literally unable to progress. Many people have done the math and it takes something like 30,000,000 years to complete the game. Of real-time. So unless you are immortal and honestly think this game is going to be around that long along with Steam and achievements, you\\'re not going to finish it. Ever. And it seems like the developers are really reluctant to own up to this.\n\nMany people have mental disorders or are just otherwise weak-willed and will get addicted to games like this and feel obligated to spend money. The fact that the developers make it so no matter what the game ends up impossible to progress and you can never reach your goals is just gross. They are well aware of the problem and just don\\'t care. They make excuses and pretend like they\\'ll eventually fix it but they never have.

Not even if I had gone out and bought a wilderbeast and kept it in my apartment; I love this game, and its reds in the bed successor.\n\nThe beauty and fun of a well made clicker is what makes it seem so wrong, namely the simplicity. Click here, see a number incrementally rise over there. Work towards buying another of that item or, if the time's right, buying your first of the next, more lucrative item.\n\nNow I'm sure most of you already know that - it's not your first clickeo, right?\n\nWhere I think AdCap really stands out from the massive clicker herd is the fact that it's grounded in a kind of semi-reality setting. All you're doing is scratching that dirty capitalist itch, that desire to ACQUIRE; those fellas from Star Trek with the ears and the libido would LOVE AdCap.\n\nI played the game for a while before I realised I was rubbish at it. Seriously, I was clicking in all the wrong places at all the wrong times. I only really found this out when I took part in one of the \"events\".\n\nEvents take place every few weeks or so and are a way to turn your enjoyment of the game into something else altogether. Before my first event I had the game running in the background as I did something else on the PC, dipping in and out of the game to spend my earnings acquired whilst I was away, having a mad couple of minutes clicking away if I was close to being able to afford a large purchase.\n\nOnce I joined my first event, this little now and then distraction turned into a full blown obsession....for a little while anyway. I quickly realised that I was falling so far behind so many players in the massively multiplayer clickfest and became disheartened(aw, poor me). \n\nI already knew that you could buy your way to faster success with items purchased from the in-game shop that would boost your earning, substantially in some instances. \n\nSo, I stopped bothering with the event and put my abject failure down to the fact that others were shelling out REAL money(that'll be the narcissism kicking in) to aid in their quest for AdCap Cap, if you know what I mean. Now there was no way I was going to pay to increase the speed numbers tick up on a page....OK, that's a lie; truth be known, I nearly did put my hand in my pocket. So I stopped bothering about the event and carried on with the other parts of the game, the solo, neverending parts.\n\nA few weeks later and another event rolled around. This time there was an added part to the event that wasn't in the solo game(each event is constructed so that it modifies in some way the route to success, it's pretty clever) and I wasn't quite sure how it worked, so I took a look at the discussions and what I saw nearly blew my red braces off(Wall St, anyone?).\n\nContained within were discussions centred around mathematical theories and strategies for the fastest growth rate. I had honestly never considered AdCap in any kind of intellectually advanced way; I just clicked, bought, clicked, bought, got to where I could earn whilst AFK and repeated in the main. WHAT A DUMMY!\n\nWhilst the main solo games are less focused on a need to maximise growth rate, and thus don't NEED an in-depth analysis of the best route to success, the beauty of the events lies in both their time-limited and competitive nature. Couple this with the fact that each one modifies the game's economic mechanics in a different way and you have a wonderful platform for planning and refining your strategy as you go. This is further added to by the fact that you don't know exactly how the game has been modified when you start an event and there's an early part where you are clicking and observing the effect, noting it for further enhancement of your strategy. It's great fun.....even if you lose, which I did....always!\n\nSo, I haven't explained how the game works and what the features are, the different things you can buy etc...and I'm not going to. I wanted to explain to you how the game sucks you in, rewards you for smart play and punishes you for being an economic dummy. I want you to discover the features that combine to create a game that will make you think and plan ahead, mostly in the events.\n\nTry it out....after all, it is free.....which is odd when you consider it's all about boshing for dosh or being keen for the green. And don't be put off by the fact that you can purchase ways to enhance your progress; you can do just fine without, so long as you think about it and don't dismiss it as a pay to win game alone.\n\nOh, and have fun.......go on, have a click or three.\n\n* See, THAT'S how much I enjoyed playing this game....I didn't really have to admit anything, yet here I am spilling all my shameful secrets(well, some) in public just to give AdCap its fair dues.", "timestamp_created": 1486242570, "timestamp_updated": 1486242944, "voted_up": true, "votes_up": 38, "votes_funny": 16, "weighted_vote_score": "0.766591250896453857", "comment_count": 2, "steam_purchase": true, "received_for_free": false, "written_during_early_access": false}, "22694941": {"recommendationid": "22694941", "author": {"steamid": "76561198055634739", "num_games_owned": 756, "num_reviews": 38, "playtime_forever": 6969, "playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "last_played": 1469105015}, "language": "english", "review": "Thank you HyperHippo, you showed me what not to do with post-release updates.

The topic of clicker games has been beaten to death. This is another clicker game. It adds one new mechanic, but I won't be discussing it here, since if you've played a clicker game, you already know roughly how this one will play.\n\n[b]Instead, let me tell you about the part you don't know about:[/b] the extent to which the developer team apparently holds their player base in utter contempt.\n\nThey designed the game to literally take weeks of effort to beat while engaging in optimal gameplay (as my played time indicates). Fair enough. They added the Moon as an extra area. Seemed like a neat idea, but it ended up being an utter and complete slogfest, taking literally weeks just to get the first major unlock that was necessary, with nothing else happening in the meantime. Everyone saw it for the blatant money grab it was, hoping we would all pay to win, but it was always an optional area, so I was content to ignore it.\n\nLikewise, when they pushed out a buggy update to enable Steam Cloud syncing and ended up destroying save files containing weeks of playtime for a number of players, I was okay with forgiving them for a poorly tested update, since I had a backup file and was able to restore from it on my own. And bugs happen. I get that. Though seriously, they should have caught it in testing.\n\nThe straw that finally broke the camel's back for me was back on Earth, the main area in the game. See, they have had Steam achievements from the beginning, including one called \"Unlock Everything\" that would be achieved when you unlocked everything on Earth. When I started this game many weeks ago, there were 498 things to unlock on Earth. It remained that way up until the first batch of people started to get Unlock Everything, when suddenly and without any warning the goalposts were moved, an extra 128 items were added, several more weeks of playtime were now necessary to reach the achievement, and presumably there was much gnashing of teeth from people in my position as they considered whether or not it was worth it to pull out their credit card so that they could pay to win and finally make the game go away.\n\nWell, screw that.

Not just Adventure Capitalist, but the entire clicker / incremental game genre.\n\nWhile this is not the only genre that makes use of the Skinner Box to keep players going, it may be the only one to use it to the exclusivity of everything else (such as, for instance, a game). Some RPGs push their Skinner Box rewards to the point where it is debatably the only reason anyone plays the game, but even those maintain some semblance of a game build around their pellet dispenser.\n\nAt its heart, Adventure Capitalist is a game about watching bars fill up, with associated values increasing each time the bar reaches its apex. I say heart, but that's the only organ this game has. You watch bars fill up. Ostensibly each bar represents the dividends from different businesses, but in the end they are just identical bars with a different icon next to each. Other planets and holidays offer bars that fill at different speeds or have some kind of gimmick, but they too are just non-interactive bars.\n\nIf I were just reviewing this game in comparison to others in the genre, I might be tempted to throw a thumbs up at it. The aesthetic is fairly charming, the pacing of the bars is relatively well-thought out, and it doesn't feel as outwardly cynical as a lot of these clicker games. However, this genre as a whole should be avoided at all cost. It eats time that you will never get back, and at the end you were not so much a participant as an addict. It is possible to take the general premise of this genre and do something worthwhile with it, but this game doesn't even come close to that.\n\nFor your own sake, avoid this and any other clicker game.

In fact, some of the achievements don't even work - better enlist someone to help with that wanking.\n\nHere's how the game works: you click on a lemonade stand to earn money from it, and you keep doing that until you have enough money to buy another lemonade stand. Then you keep doing it some more until you can afford the next investment, and you can buy managers to click on the investments for you so you don't have to keep the game open at all times. And that's good, because it means the game will continue earning money for you when it's not open.

Each one adds (at the start) 2% to your income, so if you have 50 your income is doubled, at 100 it's tripled, and so on. The standard strategy is to do your first reset at about 150 angels, and then to reset again every time you double them. Because of how they're generated, the more of them you have, the more money it takes to get the next one.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem: you see, once you have enough angels, it takes [i]years[/i] to double them, and then it will take [b][i]more[/i] years[/b] to double them the next time.
